    "summary": "<p>This case involved a class action lawsuit on behalf of all people required to register under Michigan&rsquo;s Sex Offender Registry Act (SORA). On August 30, 2016, the plaintiff filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and similarly situated plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division against the governor of Michigan and the director of the Michigan State Police under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the registration requirement violated their due process rights of travel, work, and raising children, and that it violated the vagueness, strict liability, and impossibility doctrines under the due process clause. The plaintiffs sought class certification, injunctive relief, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge John Corbett O'Meara.</p>\r\n<p>On September 23, 2016, the case was reassigned to Judge Robert H. Cleland.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2017, both parties moved the court to stay this proceeding until the Supreme Court resolved the petition for certiorari currently pending on Does v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016), petition for cert. filed December 14, 2016. The court granted the stay and issued an order closing the case for administrative purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2017, the court reopened the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that SORA imposes punishment and that retroactive application of SORA&rsquo;s 2006 and 2011 amendments violates the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\r\n<p>On September 11, 2018, the court granted plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for class certification, finding a &ldquo;primary class&rdquo; defined as all people who are or will be subject to registration under Michigan&rsquo;s Sex Offenders Registration Act, and two &ldquo;ex post facto&rdquo; sub-classes (the &ldquo;pre-2006 ex post facto subclass&rdquo; and the &ldquo;2006-2011 ex post facto subclass.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On May 23, 2019, the court issued a stipulated order for declaratory judgment, finding that the current Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) was punishment and that the ex post facto application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments was unconstitutional. The court issued a 90 day deferral of a decision on injunctive relief to provide opportunity for legislative resolution.</p>\r\n<p>On February 14th, 2020 the court granted plaintiff&rsquo;s motions for injunctive and declaratory relief. Shortly after, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, on April 6th, 2020 the court issued an interim order delaying entry of its final judgment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 21, 2021, the court granted in part plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for judgment and denied defendant&rsquo;s motion to clarify judgment, finding that the possibility of future prosecutions for violations of the old SORA statute required the entry of a final judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On August 4th, 2021, the court found for the plaintiffs. It granted the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for declaratory and injunctive relief and plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On August 26th, 2021, the court issued an amended final judgment. It declared Michigan&rsquo;s pre-2021 SORA unconstitutional for vagueness, lack of due process (strict liability), or First Amendment violations as applied retroactively to individuals whose offenses occurred before July 1, 2011 and held that SORA constituted punishment and its retroactive application violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court permanently enjoined enforcement of the old SORA against this group (the new SORA was not challenged) and ordered notice be sent to law enforcement and other parties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The court certified a primary class and two ex post facto subclasses. In 2019, the court issued a declaratory judgment that SORA was punitive and its retroactive application unconstitutional, deferring injunctive relief for legislative action. The court granted injunctive and declaratory relief in 2020 but delayed final judgment due to COVID-19. In 2021, the court found final judgment necessary to prevent future prosecutions under the old law, granted further relief, and issued an amended final judgment declaring pre-2021 SORA unconstitutional as applied retroactively to those with offenses before July 1, 2011, and permanently enjoined its enforcement against that group.",

Hon. \nRICHARD SNYDER, Governor of the \nState of Michigan, and COL. KRISTE \nETUE, Director of the Michigan State      CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nPolice, in their official capacities, \n \n  Defendants. \n_____________________________________________________________________________/ \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This class action is brought on behalf of individuals criminally convicted of offenses that \nsubject them to registration under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act (โSORAโ) \nagainst Defendants for violations of Plaintiffโs constitutional rights to be free from laws \nthat impair fundamental rights to 1) travel; 2) work; 3) raise children; 4) have  housing; 5) \nengage in free speech activities (including the use of the internet); 6) be free from \nharassment and stigma; and 7) understand what is required by the statute -  without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest. \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n \n2.  Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and Class members alleging violations of \ntheir constitutional rights.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, in their \nofficial capacity, have, among other things: \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.2   Filed 08/30/16   Page 2 of 27\na.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to travel without being narrowly \ntailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution; \nb.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to work without being narrowly \ntailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution; \nc.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to raise children without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution; \nd.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to have housing without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution; \ne.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to engage in free speech activities \n(including the use of the internet)without being narrowly tailored to meet a \ncompelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution and the Michigan Constitution; \nf.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to be free from harassment and stigma \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.3   Filed 08/30/16   Page 3 of 27\nwithout being narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan \nConstitution; \ng.  Unreasonably restricted Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that is void for vagueness and does not allow Plaintiff and class members \nto understand what is required of them, without being narrowly tailored to meet a \ncompelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution and the Michigan Constitution. \n3.  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief for these constitutional, statutory and common law \nviolations on behalf of himself and Class members. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n4.  Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction \nfor Plaintiffโs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367.  Venue is proper pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because the acts and omissions giving rise to these claims occurred in \nthe State of Michigan and the Defendants all reside in the State of Michigan.   \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n5.  This Court has authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201 as an \nactual controversy exists regarding the rights, privileges and immunities to which the \nPlaintiffs are entitled to, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2202, this Court has authority to \ngrant injunctive and other necessary and proper relief.   \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.4   Filed 08/30/16   Page 4 of 27\nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiff \n6.  Plaintiff JOHN DOE (โPlaintiffโ) is a Michigan resident who resides in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan and has been required to comply with Michiganโs Sex Offender \nRegistration Act for the next fifteen (15) years.  See M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et. seq., as amended \nJuly 1, 2011 (SORA 2011).  \nII.  Defendants \nGovernor Richard Snyder  \n7.  Defendant Richard Snyder is the Governor of Michigan.  He is sued in his official \ncapacity.    \n8.  Pursuant to Article 5, ยง1 of the Michigan Constitution, the executive power of the state is \nvested in the governor.  The Michigan Constitution further provides that the governor \nshall take care that applicable federal and state laws are faithfully executed.  Mich. \nConst., Art. 5, ยง 8.   \n9.  Defendant Snyder is ultimately responsible for the enforcement of the laws of this state, \nand for supervision of all state departments, including the Michigan State Police.    \n10. The Governor is an appropriate defendant in a case challenging the constitutionality of a \nstate statute.    \nColonel Kriste Etue  \n11. Defendant Colonel Kriste Etue is the director of the Michigan State Police.   \n12. She is sued in her official capacity.    \n13. The Michigan State Police maintains Michiganโs sex offender registry.  M.C.L. ยง 28.721 \net seq.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.5   Filed 08/30/16   Page 5 of 27\n14. The State Policeโs responsibilities include enforcing SORA 2011, maintaining the stateโs \ndatabase of sex offenders, maintaining an online public sex offender registry, registering \noffenders (along with other law enforcement agencies), developing registration forms, \nproviding statutorily required notices to registrants, collecting registration fees, and \ncoordinating with national law enforcement and the national sex offender registry.  See \nM.C.L. ยงยง 28.724, 28.724a, and 28.725 et seq.   \n15. The director of the Michigan State Police is an appropriate defendant in a case \nchallenging the constitutionality of Michiganโs Sex Offender Registration Act.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16. Plaintiff brings this class action on behalf of himself and the Class members pursuant to \nRules 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seeking equitable and \ninjunctive relief on behalf of the following class (โInjunctive Classโ): \nAll parties currently required to comply with Michiganโs Sex Offender \nRegistration Act pursuant to M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq.   \n \n17. The Class satisfies the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because, as set forth \nherein, Defendants have acted and/or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \nPlaintiffs and the Class members, thereby warranting appropriate injunctive and/or \ndeclaratory relief respecting the Class as a whole. \n18. Plaintiff believes the number of Class members to be in excess of thousands of \nindividuals.  The exact number and identity of Class members is easily ascertainable from \nMichigan Sex Offender Registration records. \n19. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class members.  Such questions of law \nand fact common to the Class members include, but are not limited to: \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.6   Filed 08/30/16   Page 6 of 27\na.  Whether Defendants violated Plaintiff and Class members fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution in the following ways: \n1.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to travel without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan \nConstitution; \n2.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to work without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan \nConstitution; \n3.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to raise children without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan \nConstitution; \n4.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to have housing without being \nnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan \nConstitution; \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.7   Filed 08/30/16   Page 7 of 27\n5.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to engage in free speech \nactivities (including the use of the internet)without being narrowly tailored to \nmeet a compelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution; \n6.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that impairs the fundamental right to be free from harassment and \nstigma without being narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest in \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and \nthe Michigan Constitution; \n7.  Unreasonably restricting Plaintiff and class members the right to be free from \npunishment that is void for vagueness and does not allow Plaintiff and class \nmembers to understand what is required of them, without being narrowly \ntailored to meet a compelling state interest in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution. \nb.  Whether Michiganโs Sex Offender Registration Act is unconstitutional as applied to \nPlaintiff and Class members. \n20. Plaintiffโs claims are typical of the claims of the Class members, and Plaintiff will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the Class members.  Plaintiff and Class members \nare similarly affected by Defendantsโ wrongful conduct. \n21. Plaintiffโs claims arise out of the same common course of conduct giving rise to the \nclaims of the other Class members.  Plaintiffโs interests are coincident with, and not \nantagonistic to, those of the other Class members.  Plaintiff is represented by counsel who \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.8   Filed 08/30/16   Page 8 of 27\nare competent and experienced in the prosecution of civil rights and class action \nlitigation.   \n22. The questions of law and fact common the Class members predominate over any \nquestions affecting only individual members, including legal and factual issues relating to \nliability, and no claim is made for damages. \n23. Class action treatment is a superior method for the faire and efficient adjudication for the \ncontroversy in that, among other things, such treatment will permit a large number of \nsimilarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single forum \nsimultaneously, efficiently and without the unnecessary duplication of evidence, effort \nand expense that numerous individual actions would engender.  The benefits of \nproceeding through the class mechanism, including providing injured persons with a \nmethod for obtaining injunctive relief for claims that it might not be practicable to pursue \nindividually, substantially outweigh any difficulties that may arise in management of this \nclass action. \n24. The prosecution of separate actions by individual Class members would create a risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications, establishing incompatible standards of conduct for \nDefendants, and would frustrate the efforts of this Court in efficiently resolving these \nclaims. \n25. Proper and sufficient notice of this action may be provided to the Class members through \nactual notice to registrants of the Michigan Sex Offender Registration Act via direct mail \nand email, among other methods. \n26. Plaintiff and Class members have suffered harm and actual or nominal damages as a \nresult of Defendantโs wrongful conduct as alleged herein.  Absent a representative action, \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.9   Filed 08/30/16   Page 9 of 27\nPlaintiff and the Class members will continue to suffer losses, thereby allowing \nDefendantsโ violation of law to proceed without remedy. \nFACTS \nI.  History of the Michigan Sex Offender Registration Act \n27. Michigan passed its first sex offender registration law in 1994.  Mich. Pub. Act 295 \n(1994) (eff. 10/1/95).  Before that time, Michigan did not require anyone to register as a \nsex offender for any purpose.    \n28. The 1994 statute established a private database containing basic information about people \nconvicted of sex offenses.  Registration information was available only to law \nenforcement, and was exempt from all public disclosure.  A person who divulged registry \ninformation to the public was guilty of a misdemeanor, and a registrant whose \ninformation was revealed had a civil cause of action for treble damages.  Mich. Pub. Act \n295, Sec. 10 (1994).    \n29. The statute did not require regular verification or reporting.  After the initial registration \nwas completed, the only additional obligation was to notify local law enforcement within \n10 days of a change of address.  The registrant did not need to notify law enforcement in \nperson.  Mich. Pub. Act 295, Sec. 5(1) (1994).  \n30. Registry information was maintained for 25 years for individuals convicted of one \noffense, and for life for individuals convicted of multiple offenses.  Mich.  \nPub. Act 295, Sec. 5(3)-(4) (1994).    \n31. Since that time, the legislature has repeatedly amended the statute, each time imposing a \nstricter regime with new burdens on registrants, and covering more people and conduct.    \n32. Effective April 1, 1997, the statuteโs confidentiality protections were relaxed.  Law \nenforcement agencies were required to make registry information available to the public \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.10   Filed 08/30/16   Page 10 of 27\n(for zip codes within the agencyโs jurisdiction) during regular business hours.  Mich. Pub. \nAct 494, Sec. 10(2) (1996).  The public could view a paper copy of the registry by \nvisiting their local law enforcement agency.    \n33. In 1999, registry information became available to the public on the Internet through the \npublic sex offender registry.  Mich. Pub. Act 85, Sec. 8(2), 10(2)(3) (1999).  \n34. New in-person reporting requirements were imposed, with registrants being required to \nreport quarterly or yearly, depending on their offense.  Mich. Pub. Act 85, Sec. 5a(4) \n(1999).  \n35. In addition, the 1999 amendments: expanded the list of offenses for which registration \nwas required and the categories of individuals required to register for life; lengthened the \npenalties for registration-related offenses; required registrants to maintain a driverโs \nlicense or personal identification card; made registry information on certain juveniles \npublic; required fingerprinting and digitized photographs for registrants; and mandated \nregistration for out-of-state students, people working in the state, and anyone convicted of \na listed offense or required to register in another state or country.  Mich. Pub. Act 85 \n(1999).  \n36. In 2002, additional requirements were imposed on both resident and nonresident \nregistrants to report (in person) when they enrolled, dis-enrolled, worked, or volunteered \nat institutions of higher learning.  Mich. Pub. Act 542, Sec. 4a (2002).  \n37. Amendments in 2004 required the Internet-based public sex offender registry to include \nphotographs.  Mich. Pub. Act 238 (2004).  In addition, a fee was imposed on registrants.  \nFailure to pay the fee was made a crime.  Mich. Pub. Act 237 (2004).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.11   Filed 08/30/16   Page 11 of 27\n38. Further amendments, effective January 1, 2006, barred registrants (with limited \nexceptions) from working, residing, or loitering within 1000 feet of school property, and \nimposed criminal penalties for noncompliance.  Mich. Pub. Acts 121, 127 (2005).  \n39. In addition, the penalties for registration-related offenses were increased.   Mich. Pub. \nAct 132 (2005).    \n40. In 2006, the statute was amended to allow subscribing members of the public to be \nnotified electronically when a person registers or moves into a particular zip code.  Mich. \nPub. Act. 46 (2006).  \n41. As outlined in more detail below, SORA 2011 fundamentally changed Michiganโs sex \noffender registry by categorizing registrants into tiers; and requiring in-person reporting \nof vast amounts of personal information.  \n42. In sum, Michiganโs sex offender registry, which began as a private law enforcement \ndatabase in 1995, has changed radically in the last 17 years.  SORA 2011 subjects \nregistrants to obligations, restraints, disabilities, and punishment of a different character \nand different order of magnitude than the original sex offender statutes.  \nII.  Impact of SORA on Plaintiff and the Class \n43. SORA 2011 imposes obligations, disabilities, and restraints that are so extensive that they \ncannot be set out in full here, but are instead listed in Exhibit 1, which is incorporated by \nreference.    \n44. By way of summary, SORA 2011 subjects the Plaintiff to continuous reporting, \nsurveillance, and supervision.  In addition, SORA 2011 severely limits his ability to \ndirect the upbringing of his children; find housing; travel; engage in free speech activities \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.12   Filed 08/30/16   Page 12 of 27\n(including use of the Internet); be free from harassment and stigma; and understand what \nis required of him under the statute.    \n45. Finally, registration under SORA 2011 triggers a vast array of additional obligations, \ndisabilities, and restraints under other federal, state, and local laws, as well as private \npolicies barring or limiting registrants from access to goods or services available to the \npublic.    \nA.  Reporting, Surveillance, and Supervision  \n46. As a registrant, the Plaintiff and Class members must report in person every year, M.C.L. \n28.725a(3)(a), and must provide:  \nโข  all names and nicknames, Social Security number, and date of birth;  \nโข  residential address, including any address where the individual expects to spend more \nthan seven days, as well as the dates of any such temporary stays;  \nโข  employer names and addresses, including information on any person who agrees to \nhire a registrant for a temporary job, as well as the routes of travel for non-stationary \nemployment;   \nโข  schools attending or schools to which accepted;   \nโข  telephone numbers registered to the individual or routinely used;   \nโข  e-mail and instant message addresses, log-in names or other identifiers assigned to the \nindividual or routinely used;   \nโข  all other designations used in Internet communications or postings;  \nโข  license plate and registration information for any vehicle owned or regularly operated \nby the individual, and the location where that vehicle is kept;   \nโข  driverโs license or personal ID card;   \nโข  passport and immigration documents;  \nโข  occupational license information; and   \nโข  a complete physical description.   \n  \nM.C.L. ยง 28.727(1).    \n  \n47. SORA 2011 also requires Plaintiff and Class members to provide a photograph, \nfingerprints, and palm prints.  If Plaintiffโs appearance changes, he must update the \nphotograph.  M.C.L. ยงยง 28.725a(5); 28.727(1)(q).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.13   Filed 08/30/16   Page 13 of 27\n48. In addition to reporting in person at regular intervals, Plaintiff and Class members must \nreport in person within three business days whenever certain information changes.  \nM.C.L. ยง 28.722(g).  The immediate, in-person reporting requirement is triggered \nwhenever Plaintiff and Class members:   \nโข  changes residence;   \nโข  begin, change, or discontinue employment;   \nโข  enroll or dis-enroll as a student;   \nโข  change their name;   \nโข  intend to travel for more than seven days;   \nโข  establish an e-mail address, instant message address, or other Internet designation; \nand   \nโข  buy or begin using a vehicle, or cease owning or using a vehicle.   \n  \nM.C.L. ยง 28.725(1).    \n49. There are no good-cause exceptions to the reporting requirements or to the โimmediateโ \nnotification requirements.  Regardless of illness, injury, transportation problems, or other \nemergencies, the plaintiff must report in person within three days or face criminal \ncharges.  \n50. Each registration can take up to an hour-and-a-half, not including travel time.    \nB.  Family and Parenting \n51. SORA 2011 has severely impaired Plaintiffโs and Class members family relationships \nand parenting, in large part because the statute bars the plaintiff from โloiteringโ within \n1000 feet of school property.  M.C.L. ยง 28.734.  โTo loiterโ means โto remain for a \nperiod of time and under circumstances that a reasonable person would determine is for \nthe primary purpose of observing or contacting minors.โ  M.C.L. ยง 28.733(b).  This \nprovision contains no exception for Plaintiff or class members as parents or other family \nmembers, who are observing or contacting his own children.    \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.14   Filed 08/30/16   Page 14 of 27\n52. Specifically, the Plaintiff has four children, two of whomโdaughtersโare still minors, \naged thirteen and eleven.  Plaintiff cannot attend his daughterโs school and extra-\ncurricular events.  \n53. Class members are similarly impacted. \n54. Plaintiff and Class membersโ ability to participate in the upbringing of their children is \nlimited because, as a registered sex offender, they cannot participate in their school and \nextra-curricular events.    \n55. Due to their status as a registered sex offender, Plaintiff and Class members have actually \nor effectively barred from attending parent-teacher conferences.    Because of the \nvagueness of the statute, Plaintiff and Class members cannot know if or how SORA 2011 \napplies to their parenting activities.  Plaintiff and Class members are rendered uncertain \nabout where they can and cannot take their children, rendered unable to pick their \nchildren up from school, and unable to decipher which of their events they can or cannot \nattend, and live in fear of prosecution for misunderstanding the requirements.     \nC.  Housing \n56. SORA 2011 also severely limits the Plaintiffโs and class members, โand, \nconsequentially, their familyโsโaccess to housing.  \n57. SORA 2011 bars the Plaintiff and Class members from โresidingโ within 1000 feet of \nschool property, making a substantial amount of housing unavailable as a matter of law.  \nM.C.L. ยง 28.735.  Plaintiff and Class members are likewise prohibited from living with \nfamily members if those family members live within 1000 feet of school property.    \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.15   Filed 08/30/16   Page 15 of 27\n58. Some but not all) readings of the 1000 foot requirement may fall into the SORAโs \nexclusionary zone and subject Plaintiff and Class members to criminal repercussions. \nSORA 2011 does not define how this 1000 foot requirement is measured. \n59. If the Plaintiffโs and Class members families are to remain intact these geographic \nrestrictions would force the Plaintiff and his family to move from their family home; and \nwill likewise most likely uproot the Plaintiffโs minor children from their school, friends \nand neighborhood, and would have similar impact on Class members who are parents \neffected by this portion of SORA. \n60. Further, because sex offender registry address information is public, many landlords \noutside geographic exclusion zones refuse to rent to registrants, since their properties can \nthen be easily identified on the registry.  \n61. Therefore, in addition to being forced to move from their homes, Plaintiff and his family, \nand Class members may be unable to find alternate affordable housing that is not within a \nrestricted zone.   \nD.  Travel \n62. Plaintiff and Class membersโ status as a SORA registrant has and will severely restrict \nPlaintiff and Class membersโ ability to travel.    \n63. Plaintiff and Class members must provide advance notice when they intend to travel \nanywhere for more than seven days.  They must tell the police where they are going, \nwhere they will stay, how long they will be there, and when they will return.   \nM.C.L. ยง 28.725(1).    \n64. Plaintiff and Class members must provide 21 days advance notice if they travel outside \nthe U.S. for more than seven days.  M.C.L. ยง 28.725(7).   \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.16   Filed 08/30/16   Page 16 of 27\n65. In addition, Plaintiff and Class members must travel so that they are able to register in \nperson during the first 15 days of January, April, July and October, as required by the \nstatute.  \n66. If Plaintiff and Class members travel, they must comply with any applicable sex offender \nregistration laws in other jurisdictions.  Because sex offender laws are exceedingly \ncomplex and vary from state to state, it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate \ninformation about either affirmative reporting obligations (such as registering oneโs \npresence in a state) or prohibitions on ordinary behavior (such as visiting a library or \npark) in other jurisdictions.   \nE.  Speech & Internet \n67. SORA 2011 severely restricts Plaintiff and class membersโ ability to speak freely on the \nInternet.  The plaintiffs not only must provide law enforcement with all electronic mail \naddresses, instant message addresses, log-in names, or other identifiers that are assigned \nto or routinely used by them, M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(i), but must also report in person within \nthree days whenever they establish any electronic mail address, instant message address, \nor other designation used in Internet communications or postings.  M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f).  \n68. Plaintiff and Class members are or should be concerned about using the Internet because \nSORA 2011 is unclear about whether, for example, they must report immediately and in \nperson if they sets up an on-line account to facilitate basic transactions such as the \npayment of taxes, registration with media streaming services or purchase/review of \nproducts on Amazon.          \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.17   Filed 08/30/16   Page 17 of 27\nF. Public Stigmatization \n69. The public registry website posts extensive personal information about Plaintiff and Class \nmembers, including residential address, employer address, date of birth, school \ninformation, vehicle information, physical description (weight, height, etc.), and a \nphotograph.  M.C.L. ยง 28.728(2).    \n70. Plaintiff and Class members are stigmatized and ashamed by the display of this personal \ninformation, which given the nature of Plaintiffโs and a majority of Class members \nunderlying โoffenseโ,  is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  \nG.  Vagueness, Strict Liability, and Impossibility of Compliance  \n71. Plaintiff and Class members have been further harmed because the restrictions and \nobligations of SORA 2011 are so vague that Plaintiff and Class members are unable to \nknow whether or not he is in violation of the law, or are so extensive and pervasive that \nPlaintiff and Class members are literally unable to comply with the law.  Moreover, \ndifferent law enforcement agencies in different places apply the requirements of SORA \n2011 differently.  \n72. SORA 2011โs requirements for reporting personal information are so vague that Plaintiff \nand Class members do not understand what information must be reported, or what \nchanges in information subject them to the in-person immediate reporting requirement.    \n73. Plaintiff and Class members are unable to determine what information they must report \nunder M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f).  \n74. Plaintiff and Class members often cannot know if they are working, residing, or \nโloiteringโ within 1000 feet of school property because the property boundaries are \nunknown and the distances are impossible to measure without sophisticated equipment.    \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.18   Filed 08/30/16   Page 18 of 27\n75. Plaintiff and Class members do not know whether they can take his own children to a \nplayground on school property, or to a park, if other children are present.  Plaintiff and \nClass members do not know whether they can go to a mall, where children may be \npresent.  The risk of a wrong decision is a criminal charge.    \n76. In discussing this case with counsel, Plaintiff Doe learned of many obligations and \nrestrictions of which he was previously unaware.  Plaintiff is concerned that he will \ninadvertently violate SORA 2011โs requirements because he does not understand what \nthey are.   Class members are in the same quandary. \n77. Finally, SORA 2011 imposes criminal liability despite the impossibility of compliance.  \nSORA 2011 imposes liability regardless of whether illness, injury, or practical difficulties \nmake compliance impossible.    \n78. Plaintiff fears that despite his best efforts to understand and comply with the law, and \ndespite the absence of any intention to violate the law, he will be held strictly liable for \nany failure to comply.   Class members are in the same quandary. \n79. SORA 2011 imposes penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for violations of the Act.  \nM.C.L. ยงยง 28.729(1); 28.734(2); 28.735(2).  \nH.  Consequences Beyond SORA 2011 \n80. Because Plaintiff and Class members are required to register as a sex offender under \nSORA 2011, they are also subject to a vast and labyrinthine array of laws and ordinances \nimposed on registered sex offenders by the federal government, other state or tribal \ngovernments, and local municipalities.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.19   Filed 08/30/16   Page 19 of 27\n81. Because registration in one state generally triggers registration in another state, the fact \nthat Plaintiff and Class members are subject to SORA 2011 means they are also subject \nto the sex offender laws of other jurisdictions if they travel or move.  \n82. In addition, because Plaintiff and Class members are required to register as a sex offender \nunder SORA 2011, they is subject to policies by private entities that refuse to provide \ngoods or services to registered sex offenders.  But for the fact that Plaintiff and Class \nmembers are labeled by the state as  registered sex offenders, the goods and services \nprovided by those private entities would generally be available to them.  \n    \nIII.  SORA is Not Rationally Related to the Goal of Public Safety   \n  \n83. The avowed purpose of Michiganโs sex offender registry is to โprevent[] and protect[] \nagainst the commission of future criminal sexual acts by convicted sex offenders.โ  \nM.C.L. ยง 28.721a.    \n84. The idea that SORA 2011 will promote public safety is based on the assumption that sex \noffender registration will reduce recidivism by convicted offenders and thereby reduce \nthe risk to the public.      \n85. That assumption set forth in Paragraph 84 is false.  \n86. In fact, the research shows that public registries are likely to increase, rather than \ndecrease, recidivism, and are therefore counterproductive to their avowed purpose of \npublic protection.    \n87. Specifically, this research shows that the more people a state subjects to public sex \noffender registration, the higher the relative frequency of sex offenses in that state.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.20   Filed 08/30/16   Page 20 of 27\nPublic registries (based on the offense of conviction) correlate with an increase in \nfrequency of sex offenses against all types of victims. \n88. Applied to Michigan, this research suggests that SORA 2011 contributes to sex offense \nrates in Michigan that are 10% higher than they would be without SORA 2011.   \n89. Although it may seem counter-intuitive that public registration increases rather than \ndecreases recidivism, these results reflect the fact that sex offender registration and the \nattendant consequences exacerbate risk factors for recidivism, such as lack of \nemployment and housing, and prevent healthy reintegration into the community.   \n90. These results are mirrored by other evidence-based research on the impact of sex \noffender registration.  Most studies reveal no significant reduction in sex crime rates that \ncan be attributed to sex offender laws and policies.  Rather, there is a significant body of \nempirical work that overwhelmingly shows that, at best, public registration makes no \ndifference to recidivism rates, and that it may well be counter-productive \n91. The two studies that detected reductions in sex crime recidivism after the passage of \nregistration laws were both in states that have risk-based, rather than offense-based, \nclassification, and that limit public notification to those offenders who have been \nindividually determined to pose the greatest threat to community safety.   \n92. Moreover, there is no research to support the hypothesis that registrants who live closer \nto child-oriented settings are more likely to reoffend.  Rather, the research shows that \nwhere registrants live is not a significant contributing factor to recidivism.   \n93. Residency restrictions reduce housing options for registrants, leading to housing \ninstability.  Housing instability is consistently correlated with higher criminal recidivism, \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.21   Filed 08/30/16   Page 21 of 27\nand may help account for the increases in recidivism triggered by registration. Thus, \nresidency restrictions are likely to increase rather than decrease sexual offending.  \n94. Similarly, requirements that interfere with employment, social support, and engagement \nin pro-social activities undermine the avowed public safety goals of sex offender \nregistration laws.  Social policies that ostracize and disrupt the stability of sex offenders \nare counterproductive to increasing public safety.   \n95. Failure to comply with registration requirements does not predict sexual recidivism.  \n96. There is no empirical evidence to support the notion that more frequent registration \ncheck-ins lower recidivism, nor is there evidence that reporting additional information \n(e.g., email addresses, employment information) reduces recidivism.  In sum, SORA \n2011 is not rationally related to the public safety goal it purports to serve.  \nIV.  The Requirements of SORA Bear No Reasonable Relationship to the Risk \nThat Individual Registrants Pose to the Community   \n \n97. SORA 2011 is also premised on the assumption that all individuals convicted of sex \noffenses pose a great risk to public safety, which justifies continuous and lengthy \nsupervision and restrictions.  \n98. In fact, while some individuals convicted of sex offenses will reoffend, the vast majority \nof new sex offenses are committed not by registered offenders, but by individuals without \nprior sex offenses.   \n99. Among those with prior sex offenses, recidivism rates vary with the presence of certain \nrisk factors.  While some individuals convicted of sex offenses pose a significant risk to \npublic safety, most, such as Plaintiff, do not.    \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.22   Filed 08/30/16   Page 22 of 27\n100.  SORA 2011 is not based on risk.  The tier to which an individual is assigned, \nwhether an individual is listed on the public registry, and how long an individual must \nregister, are all based solely on the offense of conviction, not on the individualโs level of  \nrisk.    \n101.  Because recidivism risk declines significantly with advancing age and with time \nspent offense-free in the community, requiring registration for extensive time periods is \nboth inefficient and unnecessary.   \n102.  In addition, SORA 2011, by focusing on the danger posed by strangers (who can \nbe identified through the registry), misidentifies the source of risk.  In the overwhelming \nmajority of cases of child sexual abuse, the offender was a family member or \nacquaintance, not a stranger listed on the registry.    \n103.  Public sex offender registration and residency restrictions, which focus on \nโstranger danger,โ give parents a false sense of security by implying that knowing where \nsex offenders live or banishing them from the community in fact reduces the risk of sex \noffenses being committed, when such measures do not have this effect.   \n104.  In sum, the requirements of SORA 2011 bear no rational relationship to the risks \nthat individual registrants pose to the community.  \nV.  Geographic Exclusion Zones  \n  \n105.  Under SORA 2011, Plaintiff is barred from residing, working, or โloiteringโ \nwithin a โstudent safety zone,โ defined as 1000 feet from school property.  M.C.L. ยงยง \n28.733-735.  \n106.  The State of Michigan does not make maps available to the public showing where \nthe exclusion zones are located or what their boundaries are.    \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.23   Filed 08/30/16   Page 23 of 27\n107.  It is impossible for ordinary people to identify the areas that are inside and outside \nthe exclusion zones.  The task is difficult even for experts with sophisticated mapping \ntechnology.  Distances are difficult to estimate or measure and property boundaries are \ndifficult to locate.  Moreover, exclusion zones often have irregular shapes, because they \nare measured from property boundaries and because the zones overlap.  Exclusion zones \nare not shaped like simple circles around a fixed point.   \n108.  It is impossible for Plaintiff to comply with the prohibition on โloitering,โ which \nrequires moment-to-moment knowledge of whether or not they are in an exclusion zone.   \n109.  The exclusion zones cover vast areas, especially in urban and suburban regions.  \nBecause exclusion zones are measured as the crow flies, rather than as people actual \ntravel between two points, some exclusion zones cover areas that are much further than \n1000 feet from a school, in terms of the travel distance.   \n110.  Exclusion zones put a significant percentage of cities and towns off-limits.  As a \nresult, exclusion zones severely restrict access to employment and housing, and limit \nregistrantsโ ability to engage in normal human activity.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE (Travel)  \n  \n111.  The right to travel is a fundamental right that is protected under the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.    \n112.  SORA 2011 substantially interferes with Plaintiffโs and Class members ability to  \ntravel.  \n113.  SORA 2011 does not provide for any individualized consideration before \nrestricting the plaintiffsโ right to travel.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.24   Filed 08/30/16   Page 24 of 27\n114.  SORA 2011 violates Plaintiffโs and Class membersโ fundamental right to travel \nbecause it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.   \nCOUNT II: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE (Work)  \n  \n115.  The right to engage in the common occupations of life is a fundamental right that \nis protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n116.  SORA 2011 substantially interferes with Plaintiffโs and Class membersโ ability to \nengage in the common occupations of life. \n117.  SORA 2011 creates a wholesale barrier to employment.  That barrier is not based \non the Plaintiffโs or Class memberโs fitness or capacity to work in the jobs from which \nthey have been excluded.  \n118.  SORA 2011 does not provide for any individualized consideration before \nrestricting the Plaintiff or Class memberโs ability to engage in the common occupations \nof life.    \n119.  SORA 2011 as applied to Plaintiff and Class members, violates their fundamental \nright to engage in the common occupations of life because it is not narrowly tailored to \nserve a compelling state interest.   \nCOUNT III: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE (Children) \n  \n120.  The right to direct the education and upbringing of children is a fundamental right \nthat is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n121.  By mandating geographically restricting areas where Plaintiff and Class members \ncan live, work or โloiterโ, SORA 2011 substantially interferes with their ability to direct \nthe education and upbringing of their children.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.25   Filed 08/30/16   Page 25 of 27\n122.  SORA 2011 does not provide for any individualized consideration before \nrestricting Plaintiffโs or Class memberโs rights to direct the education and upbringing of \nhis children.  \n123.  SORA 2011 violates Plaintiffโs and Class members fundamental right to direct the \neducation and upbringing of children because it is not narrowly tailored to serve a  \ncompelling state interest.   \nCOUNT IV: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE  (Vagueness, \nImpossibility and Strict Liability)  \n  \n124.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from \nenforcing laws that are unconstitutionally vague.  As a matter of due process, statutory \nrequirements must be written with sufficient specificity that persons of ordinary \nintelligence need not guess at their meaning and will not differ as to their application.    \n125.  Under the vagueness doctrine, SORA 2011 contains provisions that are \nconstitutionally invalid as applied to Plaintiff because those provisions fail to provide a \nperson of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is required and what is prohibited \nunder the statute, making it impossible for the plaintiffs to conform their conduct to the \nstatutory requirements, and making it likely that the statute will be enforced in different \nways in different places or against different people.  \n126.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from \nenforcing laws with which it is impossible to comply.  SORA 2011 contains provisions \nwith which compliance is impossible.  \n127.  The Due Process Clause also limits the use of strict liability in the criminal law.  \nSORA 2011 contains provisions that impose strict liability in violation of due process.    \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.26   Filed 08/30/16   Page 26 of 27\n128.  The parts of SORA 2011 that are void for vagueness, or are impossible to comply \nwith, or wrongly impose strict liability include but are not limited to:  \na.  the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง  \ni.  733-734;   \nb.  the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง  \ni.  733-734;  \nc.  the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง 28.733  \n& 735;  \nd.  the requirement to immediately report changes in personal data, M.C.L. ยง  \n28.725;  \ne.  the requirement to report educational information, M.C.L. ยง 28.724a; and  \nf.  the requirement to maintain a driverโs license or state personal identification card \nwith a current address.  M.C.L. ยง 28.725a(7).  \n \nLACK OF LEGAL REMEDY \n \n129.  Plaintiff and Class memberโs harm is ongoing, and cannot be alleviated except by  \ninjunctive relief.   \n130.  No other remedy is available at law.   \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n \n   Wherefore, Plaintiff and Class members request that this Court:  \na.  That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action under Rules \n23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that Plaintiff be certified as \nclass representative and Plaintiffโs counsel be appointed as counsel for the Class; \nb.  That the unlawful conduct alleged herein be declared to be illegal in in violation of the \nfederal and state constitutional law as alleged herein; \nc.  That a temporary and permanent injunction issue as to the enforcement of the \nunconstitutional clauses of SORA as written;  \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 1, PageID.27   Filed 08/30/16   Page 27 of 27\nd.  That the Court order Defendants to cease enforcement of the unconstitutional clauses of \nSORA as written as to Plaintiff and Class members; \ne.  That Defendants be enjoined from engaging in the same or similar practices alleged \nherein; \nf.  That Plaintiff and Class members  recover their costs of suit, attorneysโ fees and expenses \nas allowed by law; and \ng.

Hon. Robert H. Cleland \n \nRICHARD SNYDER, Governor of the    Mag. Judge David R. Grand \nState of Michigan, and COL. KRISTE \nETUE, Director of the Michigan State      \nPolice, in their official capacities,         \n \n    Defendants. \n__________________________________________________________________ \n \nSTIPULATED ORDER GRANTING CLASS CERTIFICATION  \n \n  The parties, by counsel, stipulate to an order granting class certification, \nthough slightly modifying the class definitions set forth in the plaintiffsโ second \namended complaint (ECF #34) and in the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification \n(ECF #35). The defendantsโ consent to certification is limited to the currently \noperative version of Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA). Should \nthe legislature amend SORA, the parties are free to return to this Court to \npropose, either jointly or separately, modification or termination of this \ncertification order if appropriate in light of any such legislative changes. This \ncertification order will remain operative pending the Courtโs ruling on any such \nrequests.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 46, PageID.693   Filed 09/11/18   Page 2 of 6\n   The parties agree, and the Court orders, as follows:  \n1.  The plaintiffsโ motion for class certification is granted, as set forth below. \n2.  The Court certifies a โprimary classโ defined as all people who are or will \nbe subject to registration under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act.  \n3.  The Court, pursuant to the agreement of the parties, certifies not one but \ntwo โex post factoโ sub-classes, defined as follows: \n  a.  The โpre-2006 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before January 1, 2006, and who have committed no \nregistrable offense since. \n \n  b.  The โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration on or after January 1, 2006, but before April 12, 2011, and \nwho have committed no registrable offense since. \n \n4.  The primary class seeks relief on Count I (vagueness); Count II (strict \nliability), and Count III (First Amendment). \n5.  The two ex post facto subclasses seek relief on Count IV (ex post facto \nviolation).   \n6.  The Court finds that, as to the primary class and the two subclasses, the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) are met because (1) the class and subclasses \nare so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class and subclasses, (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 46, PageID.694   Filed 09/11/18   Page 3 of 6\nclass and subclasses, and (4) the representative plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class and subclasses.  \n7.  The Court finds that, as to the primary class and the two subclasses, the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) are met because prosecuting separate \nactions by or against individual class members would create a risk of \nโinconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members \nthat would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the \nclassโ.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A).  \n8.  The Court finds that, as to the primary class and the two subclasses, the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) are met because the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat final injunctive relief would be appropriate respecting the class as a whole if \nplaintiffs prevail in demonstrating that those actions or inactions violate plaintiffsโ \nrights.    \n9.  Plaintiffs John Does #1-6 are named as class representatives for the \nprimary class. \n10.  Plaintiffs John Doe # 1, John Doe #2 and John Doe #3 are named as class \nrepresentatives for the pre-2006 ex post facto subclass. \n11.  Plaintiffs John Doe # 4 and John Doe # 5 are named as class \nrepresentatives for the 2006-2011 ex post facto subclass. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 46, PageID.695   Filed 09/11/18   Page 4 of 6\n12.  The Court finds that plaintiffsโ counsel are qualified to handle this class \naction litigation and will zealously prosecute the case for the class. The Court \ntherefore appoints Miriam Aukerman, Alyson Oliver, and Paul Reingold as class \ncounsel under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g). In appointing Ms. Aukerman, Ms. Oliver and \nMr. Reingold as class counsel, the Court has considered the factors set out Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i)-(iv). \n13.  Because this order converts one ex post facto subclass into two sub-\nclasses, all references in the plaintiffsโ second amended complaint to the โex post \nfacto subclassโ should be read as saying the โex post facto subclasses.โ The \namended subclass definitions set forth in this order shall control.  \n14.  By creating two discrete ex post facto subclasses, the parties and the \nCourt will be able to tailor with specificity any relief on the ex post facto claim to \nDoes #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016), based on which SORA \namendments are being applied retroactively to which registrants.  \n15.  By stipulating to this order, the plaintiffs, and the class members they \nrepresent, are not waiving any claims with respect to other causes of action or \nother forms of relief which they have not pled in this action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief.  \nSO ORDERED. \n  S/Robert H.

This class action is brought on behalf of individuals subject to registration \nunder Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et \nseq., seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of their constitutional \nrights.  \n2.  Almost two years ago, in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016), \ncert denied, 138 S. Ct. 55 (2017) (โDoes Iโ), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \nheld that SORA imposes punishment and that retroactive application of SORAโs \n2006 and 2011 amendments violates the U.S. Constitutionโs Ex Post Facto Clause.  \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.346   Filed 06/28/18   Page 2 of 47\n3.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan continues to subject tens of thousands of \nregistrants to retroactive punishment under SORA.  \n4.  More than three years ago, this Court held (1) that SORAโs prohibitions on \nworking, residing, or loitering in exclusion zones are unconstitutionally vague; (2) \nthat certain of SORAโs reporting requirements are unconstitutionally vague; (3) \nthat imposing strict liability for SORA violations violates due process (and there-\nfore SORA therefore must be read to incorporate a knowledge requirement); and \n(4) that the requirement to report certain electronic identifiers immediately violates \nthe First Amendment. See Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. \n2015).  \n5.  In a subsequent opinion, Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. Supp. 3d 722 (E.D. \nMich. 2015), this Court further held that the retroactive incorporation of the life-\ntime registration obligation to report certain electronic identifiers also violates the \nFirst Amendment.1  \n6.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan continues to subject tens of thousands of \nregistrants to these unconstitutional provisions. \n7.  The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, now \nseek to ensure that all affected Michigan registrants will not suffer unconstitutional \n                                           \n1 The Sixth Circuit reversed this Courtโs earlier decision, which had granted the \nstateโs motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffsโ ex post facto claim. See 932 F. Supp. \n2d 803 (E.D. Mich. 2013), reversed by 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth \nCircuit did not reach the issues decided by this Court in its twin 2015 decisions.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.347   Filed 06/28/18   Page 3 of 47\nretroactive punishment in violation of the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I; will \nnot be subjected in the future to SORA provisions found to be unconstitutional by \nthis Court; and will be treated uniformly and consistently statewide.  \n8.  To effect that relief, the plaintiffs seek to certify a class of Michigan regis-\ntrants, all of whom seek to have the benefits of this Courtโs 2015 forward-looking \ndecisions applied to them (the โprimary classโ).  \n9.  The plaintiffs also seek to certify an โex post facto subclassโ comprised of \nindividuals who committed the offense or offenses requiring registration before \nApril 12, 2011, all of whom seek to have the benefits of the Sixth Circuitโs back-\nward-looking decision applied to them.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10. Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343 because the plain-\ntiffs seek redress under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by \nthe United States Constitution.  \n11. The plaintiffsโ requests for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized \nby 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201-2202, by Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65, and by the legal and \nequitable powers of this Court. \n12. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.348   Filed 06/28/18   Page 4 of 47\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs2 \nJohn Doe #1 \n13.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.  \n14.  In early 2000, when Mr. Doe #1 was a 19-year-old senior in high school, he \nhad a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old freshman girl.  \n15.  After school one day the two went to Mr. Doe #1โs house and had sexual \nintercourse. The police arrested Mr. Doe #1 about a week later, and he admitted to \nthem that he had sex with the girl.  \n16. The girl gave various statements to the police, initially saying that the sex \nwas not consensual, but later stating that that while she felt pressured to have sex, \nMr. Doe #1 did not force her or threaten her to perform any sexual acts.  \n17. After Mr. Doe #1โs attorney explained to him that the girl could not legally \ngive consent because she was underage, Mr. Doe #1 pled guilty in June 2000 to \ncriminal sexual conduct in the third degree (attempt) under the Holmes Youthful \nTrainee Act (HYTA), a record-sealing statute that allows young offenders to have \ntheir cases dismissed and their records sealed. See M.C.L. ยง 762.1 et seq.  \n                                           \n2 Declarations verifying the facts in this complaint are attached as Exhibits A-F. \nThe previously filed First Amended Complaint, ECF #8, named two plaintiffs. The \nindividual identified in that complaint as John Doe #1 is now identified as John \nDoe #6. The individual identified in that complaint as John Doe #2 has withdrawn \nfrom this litigation.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.349   Filed 06/28/18   Page 5 of 47\n18. Mr. Doe #1 was sentenced to 60 days in jail, of which he served a little over \na month, and three years of probation.  \n19. In the summer of 2001, Mr. Doe #1 attended a volleyball game at his former \nhigh school with a friend, to cheer for the friendโs sister. At the game, Mr. Doe #1 \nsaw the victim from his case and immediately left the premises. He reported the \nincident to his probation officer.  \n20. Mr. Doe #1 knew that he was not allowed any contact with the girl, but was \nunaware that he was prohibited from going to the school. Mr. Doe #1โs HYTA \nstatus was revoked in May 2001 as a result of his having attended the volleyball \ngame, and his probation was extended for two more years. \n21. Mr. Doe #1 completed probation in June 2005.  \n22. Mr. Doe #1 was approximately four years six months older than the girl with \nwhom he had sex. Had the age difference been less than four years, Mr. Doe #1 \nwould not be subject to sex offender registration. M.C.L. ยง 28.722(w)(iv).  \n23. Mr. Doe #1 has no other criminal convictions.  \n24. SORAโs amendments, including those in 2006 and 2011, have been applied \nretroactively to Mr. Doe #1. Before 2011, Mr. Doe #1 was required to comply with \nSORA for twenty-five years.

Plaintiff John Doe #2 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.  \n27. In the early 2000s, Mr. Doe #2โs father and stepmother divorced. Not long \nafter the divorce or separation, Mr. Doe #2โs stepmother accused him of having \nengaged in sexual activity with her daughter (his stepsister) during the 1990s, when \nhe was a teenager.   \n28. Mr. Doe #2 denied the allegations, but facing three counts of criminal sexual \nconduct in the first degree, in May 2004 on the advice of counsel he pled guilty to \none count of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree under HYTA. See M.C.L. \nยง 762.1 et seq. He successfully completed HYTA in 2007, after serving probation, \nand his charges were dismissed.  \n29. HYTA provides that if a youth between the ages of 17 and 24 pleads guilty, \nthe court โwithout entering a judgment of convictionโ may assign that individual to \nthe status of youthful trainee.โ M.C.L. ยง 762.11(1). If the youth completes the \ntrainee period โ typically a period of probation โ then โthe court shall discharge the \nindividual and dismiss the proceeding.โ M.C.L. ยง 762.14(1). \n30.  An assignment to youthful trainee status โis not a conviction for a crime.โ \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.351   Filed 06/28/18   Page 7 of 47\nM.C.L. ยง 762.14(2). Moreover, โall proceedings regarding the disposition of the \ncriminal charge and the individualโs assignment as youthful trainee shall be closed \nto public inspection,โ M.C.L. ยง 762.14(4), meaning that court records in HYTA \ncases are sealed and do not appear on the personโs criminal history.  \n31. Mr. Doe #2โs dismissed charges do not appear on a background check. \nUnder SORA, however, Mr. Doe #2 is publicly labeled as a convicted sex offender \neven though his case was dismissed and he has no criminal record. \n32. SORA is not limited to convicted people, but requires registration and \nreporting by people who were never convicted of a crime, such as Mr. Doe #2. \n33. Mr. Doe #2 has no other sexual offenses. He has two misdemeanors for \noperating while impaired.  \n34. SORAโs amendments, including those in 2006 and 2011, have been applied \nretroactively to Mr. Doe #1. Before 2011, Mr. Doe #2 was required to comply with \nSORA for twenty-five years. In 2011, he was retroactively classified as a Tier III \noffender and his registration term was extended to life.  \n35. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to require that \nMr. Doe #2 comply with all of the provisions of SORA including the 2006 and \n2011 amendments, to label him as a Tier III offender, and to subject him to lifetime \nregistration.  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.352   Filed 06/28/18   Page 8 of 47\nJohn Doe #3 \n36. Plaintiff John Doe #3 resides in the Western District of Michigan.  \n37. Mr. Doe #3, raised by adoptive parents, was born with Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome (FAS), an incurable birth defect resulting from in-utero alcohol \nexposure.  \n38. Mr. Doe #3โs in-utero alcohol exposure left him with various neurological \ndeficits. He has a developmental age of nine or ten, and an IQ of approximately 84.  \n39. Mr. Doe #3โs developmental delays make him vulnerable, and in the early \n1990s he was sexually assaulted by a co-worker.  \n40. In the summer of 1994, Mr. Doe #3 was accused of engaging in inappropri-\nate sexual touching of his six-year-old nephew. At the time, Mr. Doe #3 had a \nchronological age of 21. \n41. Several psychologists provided detailed testimony that Mr. Doe #3โs actions \nwere similar to that of a child, and that given his level of developmental and intel-\nlectual functioning, his actions should be viewed as those of a child engaged in \nsexual experimentation, which is common. Mr. Doe #3 had no history of related \nbehavior.  \n42. Mr. Doe #3 pled nolo contendere in December 1994 to three counts of crim-\ninal sexual conduct in the second degree. He was sentenced to 90 days, as well as \nfive yearsโ probation, which he successfully completed without incident.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.353   Filed 06/28/18   Page 9 of 47\n43. When Michiganโs first Sex Offenders Registration Act came into effect in \nOctober 1995, Mr. Doe #3 was placed on a non-public law enforcement registry, \nand was required to update his address with law enforcement if he moved. He was \nsubject to registration for 25 years.  \n44. SORAโs various amendments have been retroactively applied to him, \nincluding the 1999 amendments extending his registration period to life and the \n2006 amendments subjecting him to exclusion zones. In 2011, Mr. Doe #3 was \nretroactively classified as a Tier III offender.  \n45. Mr. Doe #3 has no other criminal history. \n46. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to label Mr. \nDoe #3 as a Tier III offender and to require him to comply with all of the provi-\nsions of SORA, including its 2006 and 2011 amendments. \nJohn Doe #4 \n47. Plaintiff John Doe #4 resides in the Western District of Michigan. \n48. Starting around 2009, when Mr. Doe #4 was in his early 20s, he began \nflirting by text with an underage girl. The two eventually started dating, and they \nhad a relationship for about three years. Because Mr. Doe #4 was in college, they \ndid not see each other often.  \n49. The girlโs parents did not approve of their relationship. In 2012, when the \ngirl was 17, Mr. Doe #4 was interviewed by the police about whether he had sexual \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.354   Filed 06/28/18   Page 10 of 47\ncontact with his girlfriend before she turned 16.  \n50. Mr. Doe #4 admitted to the police that he and his girlfriend had had oral sex, \nbut maintained that this did not occur until after the girl was 16 years old. He said \nthey did not have sexual intercourse.  \n51. The offense allegedly occurred in 2010, shortly before the girlโs sixteenth \nbirthday. \n52. In 2013, Mr. Doe #4 pled guilty to sexual misconduct in the fourth degree. \nHe took this plea agreement after the prosecutor threatened to bring child porno-\ngraphy charges based on the fact that Mr. Doe #4 and his girlfriend had exchanged \nnude photos via text messages. Mr. Doe #4 admitted that he had the photos. \n53. Mr. Doe #4 served 10 days in jail, and was placed on probation for five \nyears. \n54. Under SORA, Mr. Doe #4 must register for 25 years, and is labeled as a Tier \nII offender.  \n55. Mr. Doe #4 has no other criminal convictions.  \n56. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to require Mr. \nDoe #4 to comply with all of the provisions of SORA including the 2011 amend-\nments, even though his offense preceded those amendments. The state has also \ncontinued to label him as a Tier II offender. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.355   Filed 06/28/18   Page 11 of 47\nJohn Doe #5 \n57.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.  \n58.  In November 2006, when Mr. Doe #5 was living in Omaha, Nebraska, he \ndeveloped a relationship with boy who was 14 or 15 at the time. The two engaged \nin sexual touching. Mr. Doe #5 was convicted of sexual assault of a child, Nebras-\nka Rev. Statute 28 โ 320.01.   \n59.  Mr. Doe #5 was sentenced to 18 months of incarceration. He was informed \nthat under Nebraska law, he would be required to register as a sex offender for ten \nyears.  \n60.  In 2010, Mr. Doe #5 moved to Michigan to be closer to his family. Under \nMichiganโs SORA, he was subject to registration for 25 years.  \n61.  In 2011, Mr. Doe #5 was retroactively classified as a Tier III offender and \nhis registration term was extended to life.  \n62.  Mr. Doe #5 has no other criminal convictions.  \n63.

In December 2015, Mr. Doe #6 pled nolo contendere to criminal sexual \nconduct in the fourth degree for engaging in unwanted sexual contact with a \nwaitress who worked in a restaurant he owns. Mr. Doe #6 believed the sexual \ntouching was consensual.  \n66.  Mr. Doe #6 received no jail time, but was sentenced to five years of \nprobation. He has no other criminal convictions. \n67.  Under SORA, Mr. Doe #6 is classified as a Tier I offender, and is subject to \nSORA for 15 years.4  \nDefendants \nGovernor Richard Snyder \n68. Defendant Richard Snyder is the Governor of Michigan. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity.   \n69. Pursuant to Article 5, ยง 1 of the Michigan Constitution, the executive power \nof the state is vested in the governor. The Michigan Constitution further provides \nthat the governor shall take care that applicable federal and state laws are faithfully \nexecuted. Mich.

Defendant Snyder is ultimately responsible for the enforcement of the laws \nof this state, and for supervision of all state departments, including the Michigan \nState Police.   \n71.  The Governor is an appropriate defendant in a case challenging the constitu-\ntionality of a state statute.  \nColonel Kriste Etue \n72.

The Michigan State Police maintains Michiganโs sex offender registry. \nM.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq.  \n74.  The State Policeโs responsibilities include enforcing SORA, maintaining the \nstateโs database of sex offenders, maintaining an online public sex offender regis-\ntry, registering offenders (along with other law enforcement agencies), developing \nregistration forms, providing statutorily required notices to registrants, collecting \nregistration fees, and coordinating with national law enforcement and the national \nsex offender registry. See M.C.L. ยงยง 28.724, 28.724a, and 28.725 et seq.  \n75.  The director of the Michigan State Police is an appropriate defendant in a \ncase challenging the constitutionality of Michiganโs SORA.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.358   Filed 06/28/18   Page 14 of 47\nFACTS \nHistory of the Michigan Sex Offender Registration Act \n76. Today SORA imposes obligations, disabilities, and restraints that are so \nextensive that the Sixth Circuit found them to be punishment. Those obligations, \ndisabilities, and restraints, which are too extensive to be set out in full here, are \nlisted in Exhibit G, incorporated by reference.  \n77. It was not always so. Michigan passed its first sex offender registration law \nin 1994. Mich. Pub. Act 295 (1994) (eff. 10/1/95). Before that time, Michigan did \nnot require anyone to register as a sex offender for any purpose.  \n78. The 1994 statute established a private law enforcement database containing \nbasic information about people convicted of sex offenses. Registration information \nwas exempt from all public disclosure. The statute did not require regular verifica-\ntion or reporting.  \n79. After the initial registration was completed, the only additional obligation \nwas to notify local law enforcement within 10 days of a change of address. The \nregistrant did not need to notify law enforcement in person. Mich. Pub. Act 295, \nSec. 5(1) (1994). Registry information was maintained for 25 years for individuals \nconvicted of one offense and for life for individuals convicted of multiple offenses. \nMich. Pub. Act 295, Sec. 5(3)-(4) (1994).   \n80. Since that time, the legislature has repeatedly amended the statute, each time \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.359   Filed 06/28/18   Page 15 of 47\nimposing a stricter regime with new burdens on registrants, covering more people \nand more conduct. The 2006 and 2011 amendments are particularly relevant here. \n81. The 2006 amendments (effective 1/1/06) retroactively barred registrants \n(with limited exceptions) from working, residing, or loitering within 1000 feet of \nschool property, and imposed criminal penalties for noncompliance. Mich. Pub. \nActs 121, 127 (2005). In addition, the penalties for registration-related offenses \nwere increased. Mich. Pub. Act 132 (2005). Another amendment, which was also \napplied retroactively, allowed subscribing members of the public to receive elec-\ntronic notification when a person registers or moves into a particular zip code. \nMich. Pub. Act. 46 (2006).  \n82. In 2011, SORA underwent major revisions which fundamentally changed \nMichiganโs sex offender registry. Mich. Pub. Act. 17-18 (2011). \n83. First, the 2011 SORA amendments (effective 4/12/11) retroactively imposed \nextensive reporting requirements, requiring in-person and in some cases immediate \nreporting of vast amounts of personal information.  \n84. Second, the 2011 amendments retroactively categorized registrants into tiers. \nThe tier classification determines the length of time a person must register and the \nfrequency of reporting. Tier classifications are based solely on the offense of con-\nviction. Tier classifications are not based on, and do not correspond to, a regis-\ntrantโs actual risk of re-offending or the danger any registrant poses to the public.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.360   Filed 06/28/18   Page 16 of 47\n85. Before 2011, most Michigan registrants were required to register for 25 \nyears. As a result of the retroactive tier classifications, many registrants had their \nregistration periods extended to life. There was no individualized determination \nabout their risk or whether lifetime registration was warranted.  \nThe Does I Litigation \n86. In 2012, six Michigan registrants (who are not plaintiffs in this case) \nchallenged the constitutionality of SORA on numerous grounds. See Does v. \nSnyder, Case No. 2:12-cv-11194 (E.D. Mich.). \n87. The state moved to dismiss. This Court granted the motion in part and \ndenied the motion in part. See Does #1-4 v. Snyder, 932 F. Supp. 2d 803 (E.D. \nMich. 2013). The dismissal included the plaintiffsโ ex post facto claim. \n88. After discovery, this Court issued two opinions under Rule 52, Does #1-4 v. \nSnyder, 932 F. Supp. 2d 803 (E.D. Mich. 2013), and Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. \nSupp. 3d 722 (E.D. Mich. 2015). Those opinions held, inter alia, that: \na.  SORAโs geographic exclusion zones are unconstitutionally vague;  \nb.  SORAโs prohibition on loitering is unconstitutionally vague; \nc.  Certain of SORAโs reporting requirements are unconstitutionally vague; \nd.  Certain of SORAโs internet reporting requirements violate the First \nAmendment; and  \ne.  SORA must be read to incorporate a knowledge requirement, so that \nthere is no strict liability for SORA violations. \n \n89. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit held that SORA is punishment and that retro-\n16 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.361   Filed 06/28/18   Page 17 of 47\nactive application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments violates the Ex Post Facto \nClause. See Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016). \n90. The Sixth Circuit did not vacate this Courtโs other rulings, but rather \ndeclined to reach those issues as โnone of the contested provisions may now be \napplied to the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.โ Id. at 706. \n91. The state defendants petitioned for certiorari. That petition was denied. See \nSnyder v. John Does #1-5, 138 S. Ct. 55 (2017). \nThe Stateโs Has Failed to Amend SORA to Bring It Into  \nCompliance with the Decisions in Does I \n92. The Michigan legislature has not amended SORA to bring it into compliance \n(a) with the Sixth Circuitโs Does I decision of 2016, or (b) with this Courtโs two \nDoes decisions of 2015.  \n93. The statute continues to require that pre-2006 registrants must comply with \nthe 2006 amendments; that pre-2011 registrants must comply with the 2011 \namendments; that registrants must comply with prohibitions on residing, working, \nor โloiteringโ within 1000 feet of a school (which this Court found to be uncon-\nstitutionally vague); that registrants must comply with reporting requirements \n(which this Court found to be unconstitutionally vague or in violation of the First \nAmendment); and that registrants are strictly liable for certain SORA violations.  \n94. Since the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, several meetings of a legislative \nwork group have been held to discuss amending SORA to bring it into compliance \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.362   Filed 06/28/18   Page 18 of 47\nwith Does I, as well as to address other concerns about the statuteโs overbreadth \nand ineffectiveness. No legislation has yet been proposed. Some Michigan legisla-\ntors have indicated to members of the legislative work group that they are reluctant \nto advocate publicly for registry reform, given the political costs of doing so, and \nwould prefer that the courts resolve this issue for them. \n95. The defendants have continued in practice to require plaintiffs John Does \n#1-6 and similarly situated registrants (other than the plaintiffs in Does I and other \ncivil actions) to comply with the provisions of SORA that this Court and the Sixth \nCircuit found to be unconstitutional in 2015 and 2016. \nThe Stateโs Continued Retroactive Enforcement  \nof the 2006 and 2011 Amendments \n96. Under the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, the following SORA amend-\nments cannot be applied retroactively: \na.  the 2006 amendments that bar registrants from residing, working, or \nloitering within 1000 feet of a school;  \nb.  the 2006 amendments that allow subscribing members of the public to \nreceive electronic notifications about registrants;  \nc.  the 2011 amendments that categorize registrants into tiers and \nlengthen their registration terms; and \nd.  the 2011 amendments requiring Michiganโs internet-based, public \nregistry to label registrants by tier level; \ne.  the 2011 amendments requiring extensive reporting and in-person, \nimmediate reporting. \n  \n97. Nevertheless, the defendants have continued to apply these SORA provi-\nsions retroactively to plaintiffs John Does #1-6, and to members of the putative ex \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.363   Filed 06/28/18   Page 19 of 47\npost facto subclass defined below. The defendants continue to require registrants \nwhose offenses predate the 2006 amendments, including plaintiffs John Does #1-3, \nto comply with the exclusion zones, and the Michigan State Police public sex \noffender registry continues to allow the public to subscribe to electronic notifica-\ntions about them. \n98. The defendants continue to categorize registrants whose offenses predate the \n2011 amendments, including plaintiffs John Does #1-5, into tiers. The defendants \ncontinue to publicly label them by tier on Michiganโs internet-based public regis-\ntry; continue to apply the retroactively lengthened registration terms to them; and \ncontinue to require them to comply with the extensive reporting requirements \nadopted in 2011.   \n99. When plaintiffs John Does #1-6 and members of the putative class register, \nthe registering agency is supposed to provide them with a Michigan Sex Offender \nVerification/Update Form, which serves as proof of their registration. This form \nalso includes an Explanation of Duties to Register as a Sex Offender, which \nsummarizes the requirements of SORA with which the registrant must comply. See \nExhibit H (samples of verification forms that the six plaintiffs were given at recent \nregistration visits).  \n100.  Upon information and belief, the state provides the same Explanation of \nDuties form to everyone. This means that plaintiffs John Does #1-5, and the mem-\n19 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.364   Filed 06/28/18   Page 20 of 47\nbers of the putative ex post facto subclass, get the same form as registrants whose \noffenses post-date the 2011 SORA amendments. \n101.  The Verification/Update Form states the registrantโs tier classification and \nnotes that the length of the personโs registration is based on that tier classification.  \n102.  The Explanation of Duties notifies registrants they are subject to criminal \nprosecution and punishment if they do not comply with certain SORA require-\nments that were part of the 2006 and 2011 SORA amendments. See Exhibit H. \n103.  Specifically, the Explanation of Duties informs registrants that: \na.  โUnless otherwise specified by law,โ they are โprohibited by law from \nresiding or working within 1,000 feet from any building, facility, struc-\nture or real property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by a public, \nprivate, denominational, or parochial school offering developmental \nkindergarten, kindergarten, or any grade from one through twelve.โ \nb.  They are โprohibited by law from loitering within 1,000 feet from any \nbuilding, facility, structure or real property owned, leased, or otherwise \ncontrolled by a public, private, denominational, or parochial school \noffering developmental kindergarten, kindergarten, or any grade from \none through twelve.โ \nc.  The length of their registration period is determined by their tier classi-\nfication; if they are Tier III registrants they must register for life. They \nmust comply with the extensive and immediate in-person reporting \nrequirements, such as providing information about travel, electronic \nidentifiers, and employers. \n \nSee Exhibit H. \n \n104.  Under the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, all of these statements are \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.365   Filed 06/28/18   Page 21 of 47\nfalse because these provisions cannot be applied retroactively consistent with the \nEx Post Facto Clause.  \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Vague Exclusion Zones \n105.  Under SORA, the plaintiffs are barred from residing, working, or โloiter-\ningโ within a โstudent safety zone.โ M.C.L. ยงยง 28.733-735.5  \n106.  This Court held in 2015 that SORAโs prohibitions on residing, working, \nand loitering within an exclusion zone are unconstitutionally vague.  \n107.  Nevertheless, the defendants continue to require all registrants, including \nthe plaintiffs, to comply with these SORA provisions, and have failed to amend the \nrequirements in the Explanation of Duties provided to all registrants. See Exh. H. \n108.  The State of Michigan does not make maps available to the public showing \nwhere the exclusion zones are located or what their boundaries are.   \n109.  The exclusion zones cover vast areas, especially in urban and suburban \nregions. In some small towns with centrally located schools, nearly the whole town \nโ or at least the residential areas โ can be within 1000 feet of a school.  \n110.  Because exclusion zones are measured as the crow flies, rather than as \npeople actually travel between two points, some exclusion zones โ like those that \nencompass a river or an interstate highway โ cover areas that are within 1000 feet \nof a school as the crow flies but that would require a person to walk or drive many \n                                           \n5 Plaintiff John Doe #2 is exempt from the school exclusion zones because he was \nnot convicted of a crime but was adjudicated under HYTA. M.C.L. ยง 28.736(1)(c). \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.366   Filed 06/28/18   Page 22 of 47\ntimes that distance to actually get from the residence or workplace to the school. \n111.  Exclusion zones put a significant percentage of the area of cities and towns \noff-limits. As a result, exclusion zones severely restrict access to employment and \nhousing, and limit registrantsโ ability to engage in normal human activity. \n112.  It is impossible for ordinary people to identify the areas that are inside and \noutside the exclusion zones. The task is difficult even for experts with sophisticat-\ned mapping technology. Distances are difficult to estimate or measure and property \nboundaries are difficult to locate. Moreover, exclusion zones often have irregular \nshapes, because they are measured from property boundaries and some zones over-\nlap. Exclusion zones are not shaped like simple circles around a fixed point.  \n113.  It is impossible for the plaintiffs to comply with the prohibition on โloiter-\ning,โ which requires moment-to-moment knowledge of whether or not they are in \nan exclusion zone.  \n114.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 has been employed for six years in a manufacturing \nplant. Employees are frequently transferred from one plant to another. Mr. Doe #1 \nprefers staying at the plant he currently works at because it does not fall within an \nexclusion zone. But he does not have the option to refuse to be transferred. If he \nrefuses, he risks discipline or being fired. He believes that some of his employerโs \nplants may fall within exclusion zones, and fears that he could be transferred, \neither temporarily or permanently, to a different plant that might be in an exclusion \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.367   Filed 06/28/18   Page 23 of 47\nzone. Mr. Doe #1 worries that he could lose his job, and worries about finding new \nwork outside an exclusion zone if he does. \n115.  SORAโs exclusion zones have also made it difficult for Mr. Doe #1 to \ndetermine where he can live. Despite using Google maps, he is often unsure \nwhether a particular property is or is not within an exclusion zone. \n116.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 has worked in a variety of jobs, such as food service, \nevent set-up, and custodial services. He has repeatedly been let go when an \nemployer learned that he was on the registry. He then had to look for new work.  \n117.  When applying for jobs, Mr. Doe #3 has to figure out whether he is legally \npermitted to work there, which can be difficult. Every time he applies for work he \nfirst has to go to the police station to try to find out whether the job is within an \nexclusion zone. His local police department determines this by checking with the \nstate police.  \n118.  In some of Mr. Doe #3โs jobs, his employers have assigned him to various \nlocations, but he does not know whether those locations are within exclusion zones \nor how long he can work in any one location before being in violation of SORA. \nFor example, he was representing a developmental disabilities organization at an \nevent, when he realized that he might be within an exclusion zone, and so he left. \n119.  In 2017, Mr. Doe #3 married a woman who also has Fetal Alcohol Syn-\ndrome and who lives with her parents. Mr. Doe #3 is uncertain whether his wifeโs \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.368   Filed 06/28/18   Page 24 of 47\nparentsโ home is within an exclusion zone, and does not know when or how often \nhe can visit her without being in violation of SORA. \n120.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 had found it difficult or impossible to identify the \nlocations and boundaries of exclusion zones, which has affected his employment. \nHe works in construction and is often assigned to different jobs sites. When he is \nasked to work at a new job location, he makes his best effort to check if the job site \nfalls within an exclusion zone by using Google Maps. But it is often impossible to \nfigure out whether or not a job site is within a zone.  \n121.  Sometimes Mr. Does #4 goes to a job site โ and those sites can be located \nseveral hours away โ only to find when he arrives that the site is close to a school. \nHe then cannot take on the assignment his employer has given him, and must go \nhome, which costs him income and creates problems for his employer. Mr. Doe #4 \nwas unable to tell in advance using Google Maps that these sites were off limits.  \n122.  When Mr. Doe #4 was looking for a home, it was difficult or impossible \nfor him to determine whether potential homes were within exclusion zones. For \nexample, one home was within 1000 feet of a school bus yard, and Mr. Doe #4 was \nunsure, despite internet research, whether he could live in that home. He also had \ndifficulty determining whether homes were or were not within 1000 feet of a \nschool. \n123.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 has been unable to determine what he can and cannot \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.369   Filed 06/28/18   Page 25 of 47\ndo within exclusion zones. For a while he dated a person who lived in an exclusion \nzone; he inquired with the police whether he could visit during times when school \nis not in session, but was told he could not. \n124.  Mr. Doe #6 lived with his wife and children in an apartment that was \nattached to a restaurant that the family had owned and operated for years. At his \nprobation interview he was told that he could not work at the restaurant or live with \nhis wife and children because the structures were within an exclusion zone.  \n125.  Mr. Doe #6 wants to visit his family during the day (and sometimes does \nso) but he is unsure how much time he can spend with his wife and children before \nhe is in violation of SORA.  \n126.  Mr. Doe #6 has moved twice in the last two years and his wife has to put in \nextra hours at the restaurant because he is forbidden from working there.  \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Vague Loitering Provision \n127.  SORA severely impairs the plaintiffsโ and putative class membersโ family \nrelationships and parenting, in large part because the statute bars them from โloit-\neringโ within 1000 feet of school property, and the plaintiffs do not know what that \nprovision means. M.C.L. ยง 28.734.  \n128.  SORA defines โloiterโ as โto remain for a period of time and under \ncircumstances that a reasonable person would determine is for the primary purpose \nof observing or contacting minors.โ M.C.L. ยง 28.733(b). This provision contains \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.370   Filed 06/28/18   Page 26 of 47\nno exception for registrants who are parents spending time with their own children, \nor who are observing or accompanying the children of friends or family members.  \n129.  Because of the vagueness of SORAโs loitering provision, the plaintiffs and \nputative class members cannot know if or how SORA applies to their parenting \nactivities, to their relationships with other young family members, or to other \ninteractions with children. The plaintiffs and putative class members are unsure \nwhat actions are unlawful under SORAโs loitering prohibition. \n130.  Due to this uncertainty, the plaintiffs and putative class members do not \nattend or are fearful of attending parent-teacher conferences and other school \nevents. They are uncertain about where they can or cannot take their children, or \nwhether they can pick their children up from school. They are unable to decipher \nwhich of their childrenโs events they can or cannot attend, and live in fear of \nprosecution for misunderstanding the requirements.   \n131.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 is unable to attend his sonโs school-sponsored \nsporting events for fear that doing so would violate SORA. Doe #1โs six-year-old \nson plays multiple sports, and games and practices are generally held at his \nelementary school. Mr. Doe #1 has not been able to attend any of these events, \nbecause he has been unable to determine whether watching one of these events \nwould constitute loitering.  \n132.  In April 2018, Mr. Doe #1 contacted the local prosecutorโs office to ask if \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.371   Filed 06/28/18   Page 27 of 47\nhe could be prosecuted for attending his sonโs games. The office refused to provide \nan official answer and redirected him to the Sex Offenders Registration Unit of the \nMichigan State Police. When Mr. Doe #1 contacted the MSP Sex Offenders Regis-\ntration Unit, that office similarly refused to provide an official answer and referred \nhim back to local law enforcement. \n133.  Mr. Doe #1 also avoids attending his sonโs school events, such as a father-\nson breakfast, a holiday concert, a school carnival, and field trips, because he does \nnot know whether doing so would be a crime under SORA. Mr. Doe #1 has been \nasked to coach his sonโs baseball team, but declined to avoid the risk that he would \nbe violating SORAโs loitering prohibition. \n134.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 does not have children of his own, but is close with \nhis extended family. He is unsure whether he can attend high school sports events, \nconcerts, other school events, or graduations of family members. He is also is \nuncertain whether he can go to his local public library (because it is within 1000 \nfeet of a school). \n135.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 is unsure what activities are or are not permitted \nunder the loitering provision. He would like to but does not attend church because \nthere is a Sunday school there. He does not attend sports or school events for his \nnephews, nieces, or friendsโ kids on school property, because he does not know \nwhether he can.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.372   Filed 06/28/18   Page 28 of 47\n136.  Mr. Doe #4 has a very large family, and they sometimes hold their Christ-\nmas celebration in a hall. The family learned that their 2017 venue fell within an \nexclusion zone only one day before the event, and feared that this meant Mr. Doe \n#4 could not participate. The family lost their security deposit, and had to settle for \na less desirable location, so that Mr. Doe #4 could attend. \n137.  Mr. Doe #4 wants to become a father in the future, and his biggest concern \nabout being on the registry is that he will not be able to participate in his childrenโs \nevents, or even know whether he can or cannot participate. \n138.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 does not have children. However, he fears daily that \nhe will inadvertently violate one of the SORA provisions regarding his exclusion \nfrom school zones due to there not being a map he could reference to be certain. \nHe often worries that he may be in a school zone unintentionally and be subject to \nprosecution because of it. \n139.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 often takes walks, but he does not have any idea of \nprecisely where the school exclusion zones begin or end. He refrains from walking \noutside of places where he knows the neighborhood, because he might stop at a \npark or a bench and only later realize that it was close to a school.    \n140.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 has daughters who are 14 and 16. He used to attend \nparent-teacher conferences and school events like band concerts. Now he does not \ngo on to school property because he is afraid he will be accused of โloiteringโ in a \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.373   Filed 06/28/18   Page 29 of 47\nschool safety zone. He is even anxious about picking up his girls off school \nproperty since he does not know whether doing so might violate SORAโs safety \nzone provisions. \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Vague Reporting \nRequirements  \n \n141.  This Court held in 2015 that SORAโs provisions requiring reporting of \ntelephone numbers, electronic mail and instant message addresses, and vehicle \ninformation were unconstitutionally vague.  \n142.  Nevertheless, the defendants continue to require the plaintiffs and putative \nclass members to comply with those SORA provisions. The Explanation of Duties \ninforms registrants that they must provide information about telephone numbers \nthat they โroutinely use,โ electronic address or instant message address that they \nโroutinely useโ and information about vehicles they โregularly operate.โ See \nExhibit H. \n143.  SORAโs requirements for reporting personal information are so vague that \nthe plaintiffs and putative class members do not understand what information must \nbe reported, or what changes in information subject them to the in-person immedi-\nate reporting requirement. The John Doe plaintiffs and putative class members \ncannot know whether or not they are in violation of the law. Moreover, different \nlaw enforcement agencies in different places apply SORAโs requirements differ-\nently.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.374   Filed 06/28/18   Page 30 of 47\n144.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 has gotten conflicting information about what he \nmust report. For example, at one point his family planned a trip to Disney World in \nFlorida. He was unable to attend, however, due to his uncertainty of the SORA \nstatute and its application in other states.  \n145.  Plaintiff John Doe #2 isnโt sure what information he must report and he has \ngotten conflicting information about what he must report. For example, when he \nwanted to go on a cruise departing from a Florida port, local law enforcement in \nMichigan told him he would have to report immediately and daily to the authorities \nin Florida, and that because he would be out of Michigan for more than seven days \nhe would have to report in advance where he was going to be staying.  \n146.  Mr. Doe #2 was booking his lodging through Priceline in order to get last-\nminute deals and didnโt know in advance where he would be staying (at either end \nof the cruise).  \n147.  Ultimately the state police overrode local enforcement and said he could \ngo to Florida without knowing in advance where he would be staying, and Florida \nauthorities told him he didnโt need to register if he was only going to be in Florida \nfor a day or two before and after his cruise.  \n148.  Mr. Doe #2 would like to travel in the U.S. and internationally, but he dis-\ntrusts the information he gets from law enforcement and he is afraid that he will \nmake a mistake with his reporting requirements and be prosecuted for a felony.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.375   Filed 06/28/18   Page 31 of 47\n149.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 tries to report everything he thinks he may need to \nreport. For example, he has his own vehicle, but also reports his parentsโ vehicle \nbecause he occasionally drives it and isnโt sure whether he needs to report it. \n150.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 is fearful of using any vehicle that is not registered to \nhim. When his car breaks down, he does not borrow a vehicle from friends or \nfamily because he is uncertain whether he would have to register it. His family \nowns a boat, but Mr. Doe #4 does not use it, because he is uncertain about whether \nor how often he could use it without being required to register it. Similarly, his \nbrothers own ATVs; when the family goes camping, Mr. Doe #4 does not take out \nthe ATVs because he is unclear about whether he would then have to register them.  \n151.  Mr. Doe #4 drives multiple company vehicles. One of his employers had \nabout 30 vehicles and his current employer has about 4. When Mr. Doe #4 inquired \nat his local police station if he needed to register all of these vehicles, the police \ndid not know and so they called the state police.  \n152.  The state police said he did not have to register them, but that the local \npolice should put a note in his record. Mr. Doe #4 has no written confirmation of \nthis in his own records, and is fearful when he drives his employersโ vehicles that \nhe could be violating SORA. He also does not know whether he needs to register \nthe construction equipment he drives, which his employer typically rents for a \ncouple days or for the length of a construction job.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.376   Filed 06/28/18   Page 32 of 47\n153.  Mr. Doe #4 is a good driver, but if the weather is bad and his friends or \nfamily ask him to drive due to the snow, he declines because he does not know \nwhether driving their vehicles would be a violation of SORA. Similarly, when he \ngoes out with friends and they ask him to drive because they have been drinking \nand he has not, he again does not drive because that could be a violation of SORA.  \n154.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 has registered four vehicles that his family owns. As \nwith everything having to do with SORA, he errs on the side of caution and \nrestricts or limits his behavior to be certain that he is not violating the law. \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Internet Reporting \nRequirements in Violation of the First Amendment \n155.  SORA severely restricts the plaintiffsโ and putative class membersโ ability \nto speak freely on the internet. They must provide law enforcement with all elec-\ntronic mail addresses, instant message addresses, log-in names, or other identifiers \nthat are assigned to or routinely used by them, M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(i). In addition, \nthey must report in person within three days whenever they establish any electronic \nmail address, instant message address, or other designation used in internet com-\nmunications or postings. M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f).  \n156.  This Court held in 2015 that SORAโs provisions requiring immediate in-\nperson reporting of certain electronic information and SORAโs retroactive incor-\nporation of the lifetime registration requirement for certain electronic information \nviolate the First Amendment. \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.377   Filed 06/28/18   Page 33 of 47\n157.  Nevertheless, the defendants continue to require the plaintiffs John Does \n#1-6 and the putative class members to comply with those SORA provisions. The \nExplanation of Duties informs registrants that they must immediately report in \nperson โany electronic mail (e-mail address), instant messaging address, or any \nother designation used in internet communications upon establishing it.โ See \nExhibit H.  \n158.  The plaintiffs and putative class members fear using the internet because \nSORA is unclear about whether, for example, they must report immediately and in \nperson if they set up an on-line account to facilitate basic transactions such as the \npayment of taxes, registration with media streaming services, or purchases on web-\nsites like Amazon.  \n159.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 restricts his internet use because he must report in \nperson within three days every time he creates a new internet account. Once he was \nautomatically assigned a new account when signing up for a service; to be safe he \nhad to go to the registration office within three days to report it.  \n160.  Plaintiff Doe #2 is afraid to use the internet because he must provide all \nemail and internet identifiers. For the most part Mr. Doe #2 avoids social media \nand accounts that would require him to register within three days. His attitude is \nthat he would rather be safe than sorry, and that it is safest to limit his internet use \nthan to risk compliance issues with SORA.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.378   Filed 06/28/18   Page 34 of 47\n161.  Mr. Doe #2 works at a bank and he recently completed an on-line MBA. \nHe would have preferred to attend a bricks-and-mortar school, but to do so he \nwould have had to register with the school and place the school on the registry. He \nwas also worried about not knowing what he would have to report with regard to \nin-class or group assignments involving immediate on-line research or searches.  \n162.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 is reluctant to use the internet, and no longer main-\ntains a social media profile on Facebook, Twitter, or social media sites, due to \nSORAโs reporting and registration requirements. He tries not to use any chat or \ninstant messaging functions on the internet, because that can require creating a \nscreen name, which then triggers a reporting requirement. His father died in \nDecember, and he wanted to participate in on-line grief support, but would have \nhad to register his screen name so he chose not to participate.  \n163.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 limits his use of the internet because he does not \nwant to create new electronic identifiers that would require him to take time off \nwork to go report in person. He does not know what electronic identifiers he has to \nreport. He does not use social media. He is currently enrolled in an online MBA \nprogram, and is concerned about whether he will have to create and report new \nidentifiers in that program.   \n164.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 avoids all internet websites that require a username \nand severely restricts his internet use because he is unsure what information he \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.379   Filed 06/28/18   Page 35 of 47\nmust report and does not want to report in person each time he creates a new \nidentifier. For example, he is interested in advocacy on LGBT issues and would \nlike to comment on websites related to these issues. But he does not do so because \nthat requires creating an account and then registering it in person with the police.  \n165.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 gave up his Facebook account as soon as he was told \nthat he would have to report it. He does not understand what he must report and \nwhen, and so he limits his internet use rather than risking making a mistake and \nputting himself in jeopardy of being prosecuted for noncompliance.  \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of \nSORAโs Strict Liability Provisions \n \n166.   SORA imposes penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for violations of \nthe Act. M.C.L. ยงยง 28.729(1); 28.734(2); 28.735(2).  \n167.  Plaintiffs John Does #1-6 and the putative class members remain strictly \nliable for certain SORA violations, meaning that despite the absence of any inten-\ntion to violate the law, they will be held strictly liable for any failure to comply. \n168.  The plaintiffs fear that despite their best efforts to understand and comply \nwith the law, they will be held liable for unintentional violations of SORA, absent \nthe protections of the Does #1-5 decisions being extended to them. The putative \nclass members are in the same quandary. \n169.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 simply avoids certain activities due to the fear of \nprosecution for something that he may not have known. Mr. Doe #1โs daily life is \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.380   Filed 06/28/18   Page 36 of 47\nfairly routine because of his restrictions on the places that he can go. Mr. Doe #1 \nalso has been at his job for a number of years and does not want to risk losing it \nbecause of a mistake regarding SORAโs complex reporting requirements. \n170.  Plaintiff John Doe #2 always errs on the side of caution, in effect policing \nhimself because he does not want to risk prosecution for an inadvertent violation \nand lose everything that he has worked so hard to attain over the years.  \n171.  Plaintiff John Doe #3โs developmental disabilities make it difficult for him \nto comply with SORAโs complex reporting requirements. He fears that he will \ninadvertently fail to comply with SORA, despite his best efforts to do so. \n172.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 tries very hard to comply with SORA, but is often \nunclear about what his obligations are. If he does not know whether something is \nallowed, he simply does not do it. He fears that despite his best efforts he will \nviolate SORA.  \n173.  Plaintiff John Doe #5, too, always errs on the side of caution. Although he \nis compliant, he fears that a piece of paperwork or record may show that he is not \ncompliant based upon a mistake or something he didnโt know about, and that he \nwill be charged with a violation.  \n174.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 has a lot to lose because he and his family run a \nsuccessful restaurant business. Although he is the patriarch, his role in the business \nhas been severely limited because he is afraid that he will mistakenly do something \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.381   Filed 06/28/18   Page 37 of 47\nwrong and his error will come to the attention of law enforcement.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n175.  The plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all similarly \nsituated persons pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \n176.  The plaintiffs seek certification of a โprimary class,โ defined as people \nwho are or will be subject to registration under Michiganโs SORA. \n177.  The plaintiffs also seek certification of an โex post facto subclass,โ defined \nas members of the primary class who committed the offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before April 12, 2011.  \n178.  The proposed primary class and the proposed subclass both satisfy the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n179.  First, the class and subclass are each so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers of the class is impracticable.  \n180.  There are almost 44,000 persons subject to registration under SORA, and \nthe registry grows by about 2,000 additional people a year. All of these individuals \nare members of the primary class.  \n181.  There are tens of thousands of registrants who committed the offense(s) \nwhich subject them to registration before April 12, 2011, the effective date of the \n2011 SORA amendments. Those individuals are all members of the ex post facto \nsubclass (with the possible exception of a small number of people who have won \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.382   Filed 06/28/18   Page 38 of 47\nsome judicial relief through a separate action), and their joinder is impracticable. \n182.  Joinder is also impracticable because registrants are scattered all across the \nstate.  \n183.  Many registrants are indigent and would be unable to retain counsel to \nsecure their rights under Does I absent a class action. \n184.  The names and number of class members and subclass members are \nascertainable based on the defendantsโ records. \n185.  Proceeding under Rule 23 will promote the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this action because it will permit a large group of similarly-situated persons to \nprosecute their common claims simultaneously in a single forum, without dupli-\ncating evidence, and save the additional effort and expense that would otherwise be \nnecessary if their claims were brought through a series of individual actions.  \n186.  Already dozens of Michigan registrants have filed SORA cases in a variety \nof state and federal courts seeking to enforce Does I. Judicial economy will be \nserved by handling common issues related to the enforcement of Does I through \nclass-wide proceedings.  \n187.  Second, there are questions of law or fact common to the proposed primary \nclass and the proposed subclass. The common questions of law and fact include, \nbut are not limited to: \na.  Whether SORAโs prohibitions on working, residing, or โloiteringโ within \na โstudent safety zone,โ and SORAโs reporting requirements, are uncon-\n38 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.383   Filed 06/28/18   Page 39 of 47\nstitutionally vague, and therefore cannot be applied to registrants; \nb.  Whether SORAโs internet reporting requirements violate the First \nAmendment;  \nc.  Whether registrants can be held strictly liable for any violations of \nSORA; \nd.  Whether retroactively applying the 2006 and 2011 SORA amendments to \nregistrants whose offenses predate those amendments violates the Ex \nPost Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution; \ne.  Whether the 2011 SORA amendments are severable, and if not, whether \nSORA can be enforced against registrants whose offenses predate those \namendments. \n \n188.  Third, the claims asserted by plaintiffs John Does #1-6 are typical of the \nclaims of the class members whom they seek to represent. The same common \ncourse of conduct by the defendants gave rise to the plaintiffsโ and the class \nmembersโ claims. \n189.  Fourth, the plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nrespective class members. The plaintiffsโ interests are coincident with, and not \nantagonistic to, those of the respective class members.  \n190.  The plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel who are experienced \nin prosecuting civil rights and class action litigation and include the counsel who \nlitigated Does I, the class-wide enforcement of which is at issue in this case.  \n191.  The proposed classes also satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2) because the defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class members, warranting appropriate declaratory and injunctive \n39 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.384   Filed 06/28/18   Page 40 of 47\nrelief as to each class.  \nIncorporation of the Facts Set Forth Above \n192.  For all of the legal claims set forth below, the plaintiffs re-allege the facts \ndescribed in the paragraphs above and incorporate those facts by reference into the \nlegal claims. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I  \nViolations of the Due Process Clause: Vagueness  \n193.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states \nfrom enforcing laws that are unconstitutionally vague. As a matter of due process, \nstatutory requirements must be written with sufficient specificity that persons of \nordinary intelligence need not guess as to their meaning and will not differ as to \ntheir application. \n194.  For the reasons set out in this Courtโs decision in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 \nF. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. 2015), the following provisions of SORA are uncon-\nstitutionally vague, and therefore cannot be enforced under the Due Process \nClause:  \na.  the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733-734;  \nb.  the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733-734;  \nc.  the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733 & ยง 28.735;  \n40 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.385   Filed 06/28/18   Page 41 of 47\nd.  the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers ... routinely used \nby the individual, M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(h); \ne.  the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses ... routinely used by the individual, M.C.L. ยง \n28.727(1)(l); and \nf.  the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \n195.  The plaintiffs bring the due process vagueness claim for themselves and on \nbehalf of the primary class. \nCOUNT II \nViolations of the Due Process Clause: Strict Liability \n196.  The Due Process Clause limits the use of strict liability in the criminal law.  \n197.  This Court in Does #1-5, held that โ[a]mbiguity in the Act, combined with \nthe numerosity and length of the Actโs provisions make it difficult for a well-inten-\ntioned registrant to understand all of his or her obligations,โ and concluded that a \nknowledge requirement is necessary โto ensure due process of law.โ 101 F. Supp. \n3d at 693. \n198.  The plaintiffs bring the due process strict liability claim for themselves and \non behalf of the primary class. \nCOUNT III \nViolations of the First Amendment \n199.  The First Amendment prohibits abridgement of the freedom of speech. The \nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the First Amendment against the states. \n41 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.386   Filed 06/28/18   Page 42 of 47\n200.  For the reasons set out in this Courtโs decision in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 \nF. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. 2015), and 101 F.Supp.3d 722 (E.D. Mich. 2015), the \nfollowing provisions of SORA violate the First Amendment: \na.  the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering authority ... \nimmediately after โฆ [t]he individual ... establishes any electronic mail or \ninstant message address, or any other designations used in internet com-\nmunications or postings,โ M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f); and \nb.  the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registration requirementโs \nincorporation of the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses \nand instant message addresses assigned to the individual ... and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ M.C.L. ยง \n28.727(1)(i).  \n201. The plaintiffs bring the First Amendment claim for themselves and on \nbehalf of the primary class. \nCOUNT IV  \nViolation of the Ex Post Facto Clause \n \n202.  The retroactive application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments violates the \nEx Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Art. I, ยง 10, cl. 1, under the Sixth \nCircuitโs decision in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016) (โDoes Iโ). \n203.  Under the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, the 2006 and 2011 SORA \namendments cannot be retroactively applied to plaintiffs John Does #1-5.  \n204.  The 2011 SORA amendments cannot be severed from SORA because the \nunconstitutional portions are so entangled with the other sections that they cannot \nbe removed without adversely affecting the operation of the act. As a result, there \n42 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.387   Filed 06/28/18   Page 43 of 47\nis no statute in effect that lawfully imposes restrictions and obligations based on \nconduct occurring before April 12, 2011. \n205.  The defendants are unlawfully requiring plaintiffs John Does #1-5 and \nmembers of the putative ex post facto subclass to register as sex offenders and to \ncomply with SORA, even though that statute is null and void as applied to them. \n206.  The plaintiffs bring the ex post facto claim for themselves and on behalf of \nthe ex post facto subclass. \nLack of a Legal Remedy \n207.  The plaintiffs and the putative class membersโ harm is ongoing, and cannot \nbe alleviated except by declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n208.  No other remedy is available at law to apply and enforce the Does I deci-\nsions to Michigan registrants going forward, and to ensure that constitutional con-\nduct is not barred outright or deterred by the risk of future prosecution. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  Wherefore, the plaintiffs, for themselves and for the putative class members \nwhom they wish to represent, ask the Court to grant the following relief: \nA. Rule that this action may be maintained as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and certify: \n \n1.  a โprimary class,โ defined as people who are or will be subject to regis-\ntration under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act, and name \nplaintiffs John Does #1-6 as representatives of the primary class; and \n2.  an โex post facto subclass,โ defined as members of the primary class who \n43 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.388   Filed 06/28/18   Page 44 of 47\ncommitted the offense or offenses requiring registration before April 12, \n2011, and name plaintiffs John Does #1-5 as representatives of the ex \npost facto subclass.  \nB. Appoint the plaintiffsโ counsel (Miriam Aukerman, Alyson Oliver, and Paul \nReingold) as class counsel. \nC. Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, consistent with Does #1-\n5, 101 F. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. 2015), that the following provisions of \nSORA are unconstitutionally vague, and permanently enjoin the defendants \nfrom enforcing them against the plaintiffs and members of the primary class:  \n1.  the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยงยง \n28.733-734; \n  \n2.  the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยงยง \n28.733-734; \n \n3.  the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733 and ยง 28.735; \n \n4.  the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely used \nby the individual, M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(h); \n \n5.  the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses . . . routinely used by the individual, M.C.L. ยง \n28.727(1)(l); and \n \n6.  the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \nD. Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, consistent with Does #1-\n5, 101 F. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. 2015), that under the Due Process \nClause of the United States Constitution, SORA must be interpreted as \nincorporating a knowledge requirement and permanently enjoin the defen-\ndants from holding the plaintiffs or members of the primary class strictly \nliable for SORA violations.  \nE. Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, and consistent with Does \n44 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.389   Filed 06/28/18   Page 45 of 47\n#1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. Supp. 3d 672, and 101 F. Supp. 3d 722 (E.D. Mich. \n2015), that the following provisions of SORA violate the First Amendment \nof the United States Constitution, and permanently enjoin the defendants \nfrom enforcing these provisions against the plaintiffs and members of the \nprimary class: \n \n1.  the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority ... immediately after โฆ [t]he individual ... establishes any \nelectronic mail or instant message address, or any other designations \nused in internet communications or postings,โ M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f); \n2.  the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registration requirementโs \nincorporation of the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail \naddresses and instant message addresses assigned to the individual ... \nand all login names or other identifiers used by the individual when \nusing any electronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ \nM.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(i).  \nF. Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202 and consistent with Does \n#1-5, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016), that the 2006 and 2011 SORA amend-\nments constitute punishment and cannot be applied retroactively to regis-\ntrants who committed their registrable offense before the effective dates of \nthose acts, and permanently enjoin the defendants from enforcing the 2006 \nand 2011 amendments against plaintiffs John Does #1-5 and members of the \nex post facto subclass.  \nG. Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, that the 2011 amendments \ncannot be severed from SORA, and that the statute therefore is null and void \nas applied to people who are subject to registration based on offenses under \nMichiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act committed before April 12, \n2011; and permanently enjoin the defendants from enforcing SORA against \nplaintiffs John Does #1-5 and members of the ex post facto subclass.  \nH. Grant the plaintiffs and all class members their costs of suit, their attorneysโ \nfees and costs as permitted under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, and any other costs or \nexpenses allowed by law; and \nI.

The parties were in \nagreement that the initial deadlines outlined in the courtโs February 14, 2020 opinion \nand order are no longer feasible based on the currently strained administrative \nresources of law enforcement, significantly hobbled in responding to the pandemic.  \nUnder the existing circumstances, the parties agree that the court should defer \nentry of final judgment in this case and also agree that additional direction from the \ncourt is needed. However, the parties disagree as to the precise substance of that \ndirection.  \nFollowing a series of telephone organizational conferences with the court, each \nside has drafted and exchanged with opposing counsel a proposed interim order \naddressing how this case should proceed during the present state of emergency. As \n\n \ndiscussed during the telephone conference of March 26, 2020, the court will direct the \nparties to present their proposed orders as exhibits to concise memoranda (one \nmemorandum per side) in which the parties explain the basis for their position and offer \na critique of the proposed order of the opposing side. The attached proposed orders \nshould be clearly labeled as proposed orders. The court will review and carefully \nconsider these competing memoranda and will ultimately enter its own order providing \nfurther guidance in this case. Accordingly \n  IT IS ORDERED that each side FILE a memorandum on the docket, with a \nproposed order as an attachment, no later than the close of business on March 30, \n2020.   \ns/Robert H.

(ECF No. 84, PageID.31.)  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Interim Injunction takes effect \nIMMEDIATELY and applies to the primary class. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that during this interim period the parties will \nCONTINUE to prepare the form of a Final Judgment, notices, and a plan of when and \nhow the notices will be served.

On \nFebruary 14, 2020, this court entered an opinion invalidating portions of Michiganโs \nSORA statute as a result of various constitutional violations. (ECF No. 84.) Due to the \nemerging Coronavirus pandemic (โCOVID-19โ), in April 2020 the court entered an \nโInterim Order Delaying Entry of Final Judgmentโ that preliminarily enjoined the \nreporting requirements of Michiganโs sex offender registry. (ECF No. 91.) Pending \nbefore the court are Plaintiffsโ two motions requesting the entry of a final judgment in the \ncase.1  (ECF Nos. 99, 107.) Defendants have also filed a competing motion requesting \nthe entry of an order โclarifyingโ and extending the interim injunction already in place. \n(ECF No. 113.) The motions have been fully briefed, and the court concludes that a \n \n1   Plaintiffs filed an amended motion requesting the entry of a final judgment in \nJanuary 2021 because parts of its original motion for judgment (ECF No. 99), were \nmooted by the passage of Michiganโs Public Act 295 (โnew SORAโ). \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2444   Filed 06/21/21   Page 2 of 23\nhearing is not necessary. See E.D. Mich. LR  7.1(f)(2). For the reasons explained \nbelow, the court will grant Plaintiffsโ motions, in part, and deny Defendantsโ motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural History \n  This case has a long and complex procedural history which the court \nsummarizes below. After a previous constitutional challenge to SORA resulted in parts \nof the statute being declared unconstitutional, Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696, 706 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (โDoes Iโ), Plaintiffs brought the present class action again challenging \nthe constitutionality of parts of the SORA statute. John Doe et al. v. Snyder, No. 16-\n13137 (E.D. Mich.) (โDoes IIโ). \nThe Does II second amended complaint contains four counts:  \n(1) a due process challenge based on vagueness to the following \nprovisions SORA: \n \n(a) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(b) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734; \n \n(c) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735; \n \n(d) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely \nused by the individual, Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(e) the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and \ninstant message addresses . . . routinely used by the individual,โ \nMich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(l); and  \n \n(f) the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง \n2 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2445   Filed 06/21/21   Page 3 of 23\n28.727(1)(j). \n \n(2) a due process challenge based on SORAโs imposition of a strict liability \nscheme for violations of the act; \n \n(3) a First Amendment challenge based on:  \n   \n(a) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes \nany electronic mail or instant message address, or any other \ndesignations used in internet communications or postings,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.725(1)(f); and  \n \n(b) the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registrationโs \nrequirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses assigned to the individual . . . and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยง 28.727(1)(i); and  \n \n(4) an ex post facto challenge based on Defendantsโ continued \nenforcement of the 2006 and 2011 amendments.  \n \n(ECF No. 34, PageID.384-87.) \n   \n  The certified class in Does II includes three distinct classes. Plaintiffs \ndefine the primary class as all people who are or will be subject to registration \nunder SORA. The primary class seeks relief on Count I (vagueness); Count II \n(strict liability) and Count III (First Amendment). (EFC No. 46, PageID.693.) The \nsubclasses seek relief on Count IV (ex post facto) and are defined as follows: \n(1) The โpre-2006 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before January 1, 2006, and who have committed no \nregisterable offense since.  \n \n(2) The โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration on or after January 1, 2006, but before April 12, 2011, and \nwho have committed no registerable offense since. \n3 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2446   Filed 06/21/21   Page 4 of 23\n(Id.) \n  On February 14, 2021, the court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for partial \nsummary judgment in Does II. (ECF No. 84.) The court first held that the 2011 \namendments to SORA constituted an ex-post-facto punishment that โcannot be \nsevered from the statuteโ so โSORA in toto cannot be applied to any members of \nthe ex post facto subclassesโ who were convicted before enactment of the 2011 \namendment. (Id., PageID.1797.) The court also found several other SORA \nprovisions were unconstitutional as to the primary classโsex-offenders who \nwere convicted after enactment of the 2011 amendment. (Id., PageID.1802.) \nSpecifically, the court held: \nConsistent with the courtโs reasoning and findings in Does I, the following \nprovisions for SORA will be declared unconstitutional as to all registrants: \n \n(a) Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \n(1) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(2) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(3) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp.

And the court found that the Michigan State Police SOR Unit \nshould be required to provide โnotice of the relief granted in [the courtโs] order to all \nSORA registrants, law enforcement officials, and prosecuting attorneys.โ  (Id., \nPageID.1803-04.)  \nIn order to effectuate its decision, the court ordered โthat Plaintiffs submit a joint, \nproposed form of judgment encapsulating these rulings by March 13, 2020.โ (Id., \nPageID.1808.) The parties were unable to carry out this directive, however, before \nCOVID-19 shut down much of the state only a few weeks after the opinion was issued; \nmaking it โeffectively impossible [to enter] a final order providing complete relief.โ (ECF \nNo. 91, PageID.1847.) As a temporary solution to address the uncertainty created by \n5 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2448   Filed 06/21/21   Page 6 of 23\nthe courtโs ruling, in April 2020, the court entered an โInterim Order Delaying Entry of \nFinal Judgment, Preliminarily Enjoining Reporting Requirements, and Directing \nPublication.โ (ECF No. 91.) \nThe interim order suspended in-person reporting requirements for all sex \noffenders in the primary class during the state of emergency because the โCOVID-19 \npandemic makes in-person compliance with SORA effectively impossible.โ (Id., \nPageID.1849.) And it suspended โenforce[ment of] registration, verification, school \nzone, and fee violations of SORA that occurred or may occur from February 14, 2020, \nuntil the current crisis has ended, and thereafter until registrants are notified of what \nduties they have under SORA going forward.โ (Id., PageID.1850.) \nWhile the interim order remained in place, on December 31, 2020, the Michigan \nLegislature passed Public Act 295 (โnew SORAโ) which adopted numerous \namendments to Michiganโs SORA statute designed to address the constitutional \ninfirmities that this court found in the registry. (ECF No. 113, PageID.2294.) The new \nSORA became effective March 24, 2021, and all parties acknowledge that the new \nSORA removes or modifies all provisions that this court found to be unconstitutional in \nits February 14, 2021 opinion in Does II. (See Id., PageID.2295-99; ECF No. 107, \nPageID.2144.) While Plaintiffs comment that the new SORA also contains \nunconstitutional provisions and that โin some respects [the change] makes the law even \nmore punitive and unclear,โ they concede that challenges to the new version will need \nto be addressed in a subsequent and separate lawsuit, and contend that the court \nshould still enter a final judgment in this case. (ECF No. 107, PageID.2144-45.) \n6 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2449   Filed 06/21/21   Page 7 of 23\nDefendants, however, continue to argue that the court should not enter a final judgment \nin the case until a related lawsuit that is currently pending before the Michigan Supreme \nCourt is decided. (See ECF 110.) \nB. Related Michigan Supreme Court Case \nDefendantsโ briefs point to and rely upon an appeal in a criminal case now before \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 (Mich.). Betts involves a \ncriminal defendant who challenges his conviction of failing to register under SORA. \nDefendant/Appellant Betts was convicted in 1994 for the crime subjecting him to SORA \nregistration. (ECF No. 84, PageID.1784 n.2.) The Michigan Supreme Court granted \nleave to appeal and issued a briefing order directing the parties to address the following \nissues: \n(1) whether the requirements of the Sex Offenders Registration Act \n(SORA), MCL 28.721 et seq., taken as a whole, amount to โpunishmentโ \nfor purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Michigan and United \nStates Constitutions;  \n \n(2) if SORA, as a whole, constitutes punishment, whether it became \npunitive only upon the enactment of a certain provision or group of \nprovisions added after the initial version of SORA was enacted;  \n \n(3) if SORA only became punitive after a particular enactment, whether a \nresulting ex post facto violation would be remedied by applying the version \nof SORA in effect before it transformed into a punishment or whether a \ndifferent remedy applies;  \n \n(4) if one or more discrete provisions of SORA, or groups of provisions, \nare found to be ex post facto punishments, whether the remaining \nprovisions can be given effect retroactively without applying the ex post \nfacto provisions;  \n \n(5) what consequences would arise if the remaining provisions could not \nbe given retroactive effect; and  \n \n7 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2450   Filed 06/21/21   Page 8 of 23\n(6) whether the answers to these questions require the reversal of the \ndefendantโs conviction pursuant to MCL 28.729 for failure to register under \nSORA. \n \n(ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979โ80.) The Betts court has still not reached a decision \nin the case, and in February 2021, the state filed a supplemental brief. (See ECF \nNo. 110-1.) The brief requests that the court also decide if the new version of \nSORA, that became effective in March 2021, should be applied retroactively to \nthe conduct of registrants that occurred before the statuteโs enactment.  \nII. ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT  \nA. Mootness \nNow that the Legislature has amended Michiganโs sex offender registry to \nremove the provisions found unconstitutional in Does I and Does II, the parties first \ncontest whether the entry of a final judgment is necessary or if the case is now moot.  \nโ[A] case is moot, [when the court] lack[s] jurisdiction to proceed. Ramsek v. \nBeshear, 989 F.3d 494, 499 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Ohio v. EPA, 969 F.3d 306, 308 (6th \nCir. 2020) (โ[U]nder Article III, the โfederal courts are without power to decide questions \nthat cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.โโ)) (quotations omitted). \nโTo assess whether a case is moot, [the court must] ask โwhether the relief sought \nwould, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.โโ Id. (citing \nMcPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (en \nbanc)). \nThe parties essentially agree that the question of mootness turns on whether the \nnew SORA statute applies retroactively to conduct that occurred before the statuteโs \n8 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2451   Filed 06/21/21   Page 9 of 23\nenactment. To make their arguments, the parties rely on two separate principles of \nMichigan law that deal with the retroactive application of statutes after they are modified \nby the Legislature.  \nThe first principle is that changes to a statute, by default, operate prospectively. \nPeople v. Russo, 439 Mich. 584, 594, 487 N.W.2d 698, 702 (1992) (โThe general rule of \nstatutory construction in Michigan is that a new or amended statute applies \nprospectively unless the Legislature has expressly or impliedly indicated its intention to \ngive it retrospective effect.โ) Due to this prospective orientation, the legislature has \nenacted what is referred to as the โgeneral savings clauseโ which provides that โthe \nrepeal of any statute or part thereof shall not have the effect to release or relinquish any \npenalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute. . . unless the repealing act \nshall so expressly provide.โ Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. ยง 8.4a (emphasis added). For all \npractical purposes, this means that an individual can be held criminally liable for past \nviolations of a repealed/amended statute.2  \nThe second Michigan retroactivity doctrine at issue is the concept of \namelioration. The seminal Michigan case on the concept of amelioration is a plurality \nopinion in People v. Schultz, 435 Mich. 517, 520, 460 N.W.2d 505, 506 (1990). In \nSchultz, a defendant was convicted of possession of a large quantity of cocaine. Id. at \n \n2   Plaintiffsโ briefing succinctly summarizes how this โsavings clauseโ was enacted \nto prevent a situation where the modification of a statute would mean that a past \ncriminal violation would go unpunished because the enactment of the new statute \nrepealed an old statute but the new statute, for ex-post facto reasons, could not be \napplied retroactively. (See ECF No. 112, PageID.2248 (citing People v. Lowell, 230 \nN.W. 202, 203-04 (Mich. 1930).) \n9 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2452   Filed 06/21/21   Page 10 of 23\n507. And he was โsentenced to twenty to thirty years imprisonmentโ as the statute \nrequired โa mandatory twenty-year minimum term of imprisonment.โ Id. However, while \ndefendantโs conviction was on appeal, a new statute โreduced the mandatory minimum \nterm of imprisonment from twenty years to ten.โ Id. While the prosecution argued โthat \nboth the action to enforce criminal liability and the terms of punishment authorized in the \nstatutes prior to amendment remain in effect by operation of the general saving statute, \nM.C.L. ยง 8.4a,โ the Michigan Supreme Court held that section 8.4a โdoes indicate that \nconduct remains subject to punishmentโ but it โdoes notโ apply โwhere an amendatory \nact mitigates the authorized terms of punishment but continues to proscribe the same \nconduct.โ Id. at 509-10 (emphasis added).  \nThe ameliorative effect clearly applies when โa new, identical statuteโ is passed \nthat simply reduces the minimum sentence; however, the Michigan Court of Appeals \nhas found a legislative act that makes further modifications to a criminal statute cannot \nbe interpreted as to have retroactive effect without creating potential ex post facto \nconstitutional violations. See People v. Doxey, 263 Mich. App. 115, 120, 687 N.W.2d \n360, 363-64 (2004) (finding that the amelioration principle did not apply to a statute that \nโnot only amelioratively amended the sentencing provision of the statute, but also \nchanged the breakdown of the prohibited conduct contained in the statute, including the \naddition of a new crime of delivery of over 100 gramsโ)   \nApplying these principles, Defendants argue that the changes to SORA \nregulations contained in the new statute should โapply retroactively.โ (ECF No. 110, \nPageID.2174.) Defendants reason that โ[i]f the full measure of the reporting obligations \n10 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2453   Filed 06/21/21   Page 11 of 23\nand student safety zone restrictions under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act \nconstitute punishment, then the Legislatureโs act in reducing some of these dutiesโ\ne.g., allowing for a method of reporting other than in-person for certain minor changes \nand eliminating the student safety zones in totalโis ameliorative and operates \nretroactively for pending cases.โ (Id.) To support their theory, Defendants argue that \nwhile the โunrevised SORA constitute[d] [a] punishment,โ the โrevised SORA is now. . . \nfully regulatory and non-punitive so it can be applied retroactively without raising new \nex-post facto constitutional concerns.โ (Id., PageID.2180-82 (โ[T]he Legislature has \npruned [the] punitive elementsโ of the old SORA โleaving again a true regulatory \nschemeโ).) Defendants contend that registrants who violated provisions of the old \nSORA, which this court previously found unconstitutional, could not be prosecuted \ngoing forward for such violations due to the new SORAโs retroactive nature. And \nthereby has the case become moot. (Id., PageID.2185 (โโ[T]he [new SORA] irrevocably \neradicated the effects of the alleged [constitutional] violation,โ there is no controversy left \nfor the court to decideโ).) \nPlaintiffs reject this analysis. They contend that โ[u]nder clear state statutory and \ncase law, criminal liability is governed by the law in effect when the offense occurs. \nMoreover, the โameliorationโ doctrine does not apply because the punishment for SORA \nviolations is unchanged, and because any โameliorationโ in SORA 2021 goes to \npunishment for the underlying sex offense, not for alleged violations of SORA itself.โ \n(ECF No. 112, PageID.2253-54.) Plaintiffs contend that the present case โis not moot \nbecause anyone who committed a SORA compliance offense before March 24, 2021 \n11 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2454   Filed 06/21/21   Page 12 of 23\ncan still be prosecuted under the old SORA, and will remain liable until [Michiganโs] six-\nyear statute of limitations runs.โ (Id., PageID.2254.) Therefore, it argues that the entry of \na final judgment is required to prevent such prosecutions going forward. \nAfter review of the relevant case law, the court is inclined to adopt Plaintiffsโ \nmuch simpler approach. First, it is undisputed that Public Act 295 of 2020, which \nenacted the new version of SORA, does not expressly state that it should be applied \nretroactively, so the court is left to glean any such intent from the nature of the statutory \nprovisions. See Schultz, 460 N.W.2d at 512. While Defendants present an interesting \nargument for why the court should consider the new SORA to be only an ameliorative \nregulatory statute, at the same time they argue that the statute eliminates provisions of \nthe sex-offender registry the court has already found to be unconstitutional under the \nex-post facto clause. (See ECF No. 110, PageID.2182 (โ[T]he unrevised SORA is a \nregulatory scheme with some elements that have made it [a criminal] punitive [law]. . . \nthe Legislature has pruned those punitive elements. . . leaving again a true regulatory \nschemeโ).) By Defendantsโ own admission, this would be a novel application of the \nconcept of amelioration under Michigan law. (See id.) Michigan law does not allow \nDefendants to have it both ways.  \nPut simply, the present situation is much closer to Doxey then Schultz. The new \nSORA is not โa new, identical statuteโ that merely changes the punishment for a specific \noffense, see Doxey, 687 N.W.2d at 363, instead it eliminated entire provisions, like the \nschool safety zone requirement that the court found to be criminal in nature. \nFurthermore, just as in Doxey, Defendantsโ interpretation would raise new ex post facto \n12 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2455   Filed 06/21/21   Page 13 of 23\nconcerns because the new SORA also modified at least some reporting requirements. \nSee id. at 364. (See ECF No. 112, PageID.2256 (citing M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(h); ยง \n28.722(g)) (highlighting that the new SORA broadens what telephone numbers and \ninternet identifiers must be reported by registrants).) Michigan precedent finds thatโ\nabsent an express declaration of retroactive intent by the Legislatureโwhen one \ninterpretation raises significant ex post facto concerns, the court should hew to an \ninterpretation that does not raise such concerns. Id. Consequently, the court concludes \nthat the new version of SORA applies only to registrantsโ conduct on or after March 24, \n2021.  \nB. Preclusive Effects of the Final Judgment \nIn the alternative, Defendants argue that the court should not rule on the new \nSORAโs retroactivityโor should at least hold off on such a rulingโbecause the \nMichigan Supreme Court could decide the same issue. People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 \n(Mich.) (ECF No. 110, PageID.2188-92.) The court is not convinced, as a matter of law \nor as a practical matter, that further delay is justified.   \nThe retroactive application of the new SORA statute was not among the six \nquestions the Supreme Court stated it would consider when, in June 2019, it granted \nleave to appeal in the Betts case. (ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979-80.) Defendants, \nhowever, did raise the issue in a supplemental brief it filed in Betts in February 2021, so \nthe Court could potentially weigh in. (See ECF No. 110-1.) \nThis courtโs previous ruling on the question of certification, involving a slightly \ndifferent retroactivity question, in its February 2020 opinion rejects many of the same \n13 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2456   Filed 06/21/21   Page 14 of 23\narguments that Defendants now raise. (See No. 84.) As the court pointed out, โthe \nissues in Betts are not identical to the remaining questions of law in this case.โ (Id., \nPageID.1791.) And the Betts court may not even decide all the questions before it in \nBetts. (See id.) This court does not view the application of either Section 8.4a or the \nstateโs amelioration doctrine to be an unsettled area of Michigan law, even if \nDefendantsโ own arguments on the topic appear novel. So, there is no unsettled \nquestion of law that alone justifies continued delay in the resolution of a case that has \nalready resulted in over nine years of combined litigation. Furthermore, it is important to \nremember that Michigan Supreme Court is under no obligation to hear the case at all. In \nlight of this courtโs February 2020 ruling and enactment of the new SORA, it is possible \nthat the Court could now simply vacate its order, reject the appeal, and reach no \ndecision on the matter. \nFrom a practical perspective, a Michigan Supreme Court ruling on whether the \nnew SORA can be applied retroactively is unlikely to have any impact if issued after this \ncourt enters a final judgment. If the Betts court reaches the question of retroactivity and \nconcurs in this courtโs holdingโthat the new version of SORA should not be applied \nretroactively to conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021โthen nothing changes \nbecause this court has already found the disputed provisions of the old SORA statute to \nbe unconstitutional on Federal grounds. If the Betts court reaches the question and \nconcludes the oppositeโholding that the new SORA applied retroactively and \nameliorated SORAโs old, unconstitutional provisionsโthen Defendants still cannot be \ncharged for violations of the disputed provisions of the old SORA. (See ECF No. 110, \n14 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2457   Filed 06/21/21   Page 15 of 23\nPageID.2181 (Defendants charting the โtiming of offenseโ and the โapplicable version of \nSORAโ).) So, as a practical matter, nothing would change for the class members.3 If, on \nthe other hand, this court waited for the Michigan Supreme Court to issue a ruling, the \nclass members could be left with the current confusion while awaiting a Michigan \nSupreme Court decision that may never come. For all these reasons, the court \nconcludes that a further delay in the entry of a final judgment is inappropriate. \nIII. CONTENTS OF FINAL JUDGMENT  \nThe parties also continue to disagree on the contents of the final judgment. The \nissues have been fully briefed, and the court will now address the most pressing \ndisputes.4 \nA. Incorporation of the Interim Order \nThe partiesโ positions regarding the incorporation of the interim orderโwhereby \nthe court suspended the entry of only the final judgmentโhave evolved over multiple \nrounds of briefing. Plaintiffs initially proposed that the text of the final judgment should \ncontain a paragraph โincorporat[ing] this Courtโs interim order barring enforcement of \nregistration, verification, school zone, and fee violations of [old] SORA that occurred \n[after] February 14, 2020.โ (ECF No. 99, PageID.1891.) The Plaintiffs contended that \nincorporation would serve two purposes, (1) it would clarify โthat the final order \n \n3   As this court has previously noted, if the Michigan Supreme Courtsโ ruling โruns \nsomehow contrary to this courtโs determination, this court can modify its judgment to \nconform to Bettsโ though Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). (ECF No. 84, \nPageID.1792 n.6.) \n4   Given the partiesโ joint representations in a recent telephonic status conference, \nthe court is confident that the parties can work together to resolve any remaining issues \nregarding the contents of the final judgment not directly addressed by this opinion.  \n15 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2458   Filed 06/21/21   Page 16 of 23\nsupersedes the interim order,โ and (2) the proposed language would require that \nregistrants could not be prosecuted for any violations of SORA until โthey received \nnoticeโ of the courtโs ruling. (Id.) \nFollowing the enactment of the new SORA, which became effective on March 24, \n2021, Plaintiffs concede that the interim order does not prevent the enforcement of the \nnew SORA statute effective March 24, 2021. (See ECF No. 115, PageID.2328.) And \nthey concede that COVID-19 no longer impedes registrantsโ ability to โfulfill their SORA \nduties.โ (Id., PageID.2334.) Plaintiffs now propose that the final judgment should include \nlanguage expressly incorporating the courtโs interim order to ensure that registrants will \nnot be prosecuted for violations that occurred while the interim order was in effect. (Id., \nPageID.2338-39.) \n  Defendants agree that the registrants should be informed that the interim order \nโhas no bearing on the amended SORAโ and therefore โdoes not impinge on the ability \nof the State Defendants to enforce the 2021 SORA for conduct that occurs on or after \nMarch 24, 2021.โ (ECF No. 117, PageID.2352.) Defendants opposed the entry of final \njudgmentโas discussed at length in Section IIโ so they propose that the court should \ninstead amend the existing interim order to โclarify that the April 6, 2020 interim \ninjunction does not bar the State Defendants from enforcing the [new] SORA.โ (ECF No. \n113, PageID.2288.)  \n  Because the court has already decided to enter a final judgment, it finds no need \nfor a separate order โclarifyingโ the interim order. Further, the court finds that the \nexpress incorporation of the interim order into the final judgment will simplify the \n16 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2459   Filed 06/21/21   Page 17 of 23\nsituation going forward for both registrants and law enforcement. The final order will \nprovide a single document defining what violations of the old SORA can be prosecuted \nin the future. Such finality is clearly needed as it appears some registrants and law \nenforcement agencies apparently do not understand the full effect of the interim order. \n(See, e.g., ECF Nos. 112-2, 112-3, 112-4, PageID.2274-82 (Attorneys Mannikko, Ryan, \nand White attesting that some law enforcement agencies have continued to charge \nregistrants for SORA violations that occurred in 2020 while the interim order was in \neffect).)   \nB. Disclosure of Class Information \nDue to the extraordinary procedural posture of this class action, no complete \nclass list has ever been provided to Plaintiffsโ counsel. (ECF No. 99, PageID.1892.) \nBoth sides agree that a class list should be provided, but a dispute remains over what \nshould be included. (ECF No. 107, PageID.2151.) Plaintiffs argue that in order to fulfill \ntheir duties as class counsel, they should be given complete personal information for all \nclass membersโregardless of whether the individual is listed in Michiganโs publicly \naccessible sex offender databaseโand class counsel additionally requests they be \nprovided contact information (phone number and primary email address) for all class \nmembers even though such information is not contained in the publicly accessible \ndatabase. (See ECF No. 99, PageID.1865-96; ECF No. 103, PageID.2083.) Class \ncounsel argues that access to this information is needed so they can efficiently respond \nto the inevitable flood of inquiries from individual class members regarding their \nregistration status after the final judgment is entered. (Id.) \n17 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2460   Filed 06/21/21   Page 18 of 23\nDefendants argue, however, that the confidentiality requirements in Michigan \nstatute prevent them from providing such a complete list. (ECF No. 101, PageID.1947-\n55.) While Defendants have agreed to provide addressees, basic demographic and \noffense information contained in Michiganโs public sex offender registry (PSOR), \nDefendants argue they โare not authorized to disclose information regarding non-public \noffenders, i.e., any offender or offender information not authorized for disclosure in the \nPSOR under [Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.728(2)].โ (Id., PageID.1950.) These include \nโindividuals registered solely because they were subject to an order in a juvenile matter \nin another state or country.โ (Id. (citing Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.728(4)).) Further, \nDefendants contend that they are barred from disclosing phone numbers and primary \nemail address for all class members, even those listed in the PSOR because โ[n]on-\npublic information in the law enforcement database is confidential and is not open to \ninspection except for law enforcement purposes.โ (Id., PageID.1951 (citing Mich. Comp. \nLaws ยง 28.730).) Defendants also cite โthe Criminal Justice Information Systems Policy \nCouncil Actโ and argue this statute bars such a disclosure by government officials. (Id. \n(citing Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214).) \nIn response, Plaintiffs argue that the โ[t]he statutes [Defendants] rely upon. . . \nprovide no succor for [Defendants] claimโ that โthey are legally barred from providing \nany non-public information.โ (ECF No. 103, PageID.2084.) In support of their view, \nPlaintiffs rely on Dupuie-Jarbo v. Twenty-Eighth Dist. Ct., a previous decision by this \ncourt interpreting MCL ยง 28.214, and People v. Malkowski, a Michigan Supreme Court \nruling, which found that another Michigan statuteโs confidentiality provision allowed the \n18 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2461   Filed 06/21/21   Page 19 of 23\ndisclosure of presentence reports to defense counsel. (Id., PageID.2084-85 (citing No. \n10-10548, 2010 WL 2813343, at *2 (E.D. Mich. July 14, 2010) (Cleland, J.); 188 N.W.2d \n559, 560 n.1 (Mich. 1971).)  \nThe court finds that Plaintiffsโ view more accurately reflects Michiganโs law \ngoverning such disclosures. Because the court finds that the statutes cited by \nDefendants do not bar the court from requiring such a disclosure to class counsel, \nDefendants must provide information on class members not in the PSOR database and \nadditional contact information for all class members.5  \nFirst, the Sixth Circuit has held that โ[t]he Federal Rules expressly authorize \ndiscovery โ[i]n aid of [a] judgmentโโ including โbroad. . . postjudgment discoveryโ to \nmonitor โcompliance with the court's judgment and award of injunctive relief.โ See \nUnited States v. Conces, 507 F.3d 1028, 1039-40 (6th Cir. 2007). So, as a general \nmatter, this court has authority to require that Defendants produce information narrowly \ntailored to the enforcement of its judgment. See id. The court finds that a limited \ndisclosure of personal information identifying class members is necessary to ensure that \nthe courtโs award of injunctive relief is properly enforced for all members of the certified \nclass.   \nIn Dupue-Jarbo this court considered a Michigan District Courtโs argument that it \nshould not have to disclose information โfrom criminal justice information systemsโ as \npart of a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against it in federal court โbecause it would \n \n5   The parties should include a deadline by which Defendants must turn over a \ncomplete class list within the proposed final judgment. \n19 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2462   Filed 06/21/21   Page 20 of 23\nbe a state crime to produceโ the information under Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214. 2010 \nWL 2813343, at *2. This court flatly rejected such an interpretation of the statute. Id. \nBecause the disclosure of such information was relevant to ongoing discovery under the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court found that โDefendantsโ production of the \ncriminal history reports would be โauthorized by . . . ruleโ and it would not be a crime \nunder Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214 [(5)] for Defendants to produce them.โ Id. This \ninterpretation informs the present dispute. Since the court has authority toโand will \nrequireโthe disclosure of such requested class information through its post-judgment \nauthority under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the disclosure cannot be \nconsidered a criminal violation of Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214. \nThe closer question is whether the SORA statute itself allows the disclosure of \nthe requested information. SORA provides that โa registration or report is confidential \nand information from that registration or report shall not be open to inspection except for \nlaw enforcement purposes. . . all included materials and information are exempt from \ndisclosure under. . . the freedom of information act.โ Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.730. The \nstatute also states that โ[e]xcept as provided in this act, an individual other than the \nregistrant who knows of a registration or report under this act and who divulges, uses, \nor publishes nonpublic information concerning the registration or report in violation of \nthis act is guilty of a misdemeanor.โ Id. The statute does not explicitly contemplate the \ndisclosure of a registrantโs information to his own attorney.  \nPlaintiffs correctly observe that the Michigan Supreme court has dealt with an \nanalogous question before in Malkowski. 385 Mich. 244, 246, 188 N.W.2d 559, 560 \n20 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2463   Filed 06/21/21   Page 21 of 23\n(1971). The Malkowski court noted that the language of the then-applicable statute \ngoverning the disclosure of presentence reports โprovide[ed] that reports of \ninvestigations by probation officers are declared to be privileged or confidential \ncommunications not open to public inspection.โ Id. at 560 n.1 (quotation omitted). \nBecause the statute stated that its intent was to protect โthe relation of confidence \nbetween the probation officer and probationer or defendant under investigation,โ the \ncourt held that โ[i]n view of the legislative intent, this provision should not be construed \nto deny access by either a defendant or his attorney to presentence reports.โ Id. \nTherefore, the court found that the state was also required to provide attorneys access \nto the presentence reports. Id. \nThe general rule that can be drawn from Malkowski is that, absent explicit \nlanguage to the contrary, the court should presume that reports available to an \nindividual directly can also be provided to his counsel even when the public at large is \nbarred from accessing such information. See id. When viewed in toto, one of the \npurposes of Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.730 is the protection of a registrantโs privacy. The \ncourt simply does not believe that Defendantsโ reading of the statute in the present \ncaseโwhich would bar the disclosure of any non-public registration information to a \nregistrantโs counselโconforms with a statute which plainly contemplates registrants \nhaving access to the information for their own purposes.6  \n \n6 To be sure, the disclosure of class list information to class counsel can sometimes \nraise unique privacy concerns, especially at the pre-certification stage. See, e.g., Martin \nv. Sysco Corp., No. 116CV00990DADSAB, 2017 WL 4517819, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. \n10, 2017) (limiting the scope of disclosures to class counsel at the pre-certification stage \nto protect to preserve class memberโs privacy). Such concerns are reduced after a class \n21 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2464   Filed 06/21/21   Page 22 of 23\nTo summarize, the court finds that neither of the statutes cited by Defendants \nactually prevent them from disclosing to class counsel non-public registrant information \nfor registrants who are already members of the certified class. While Defendants are \nfree to put reasonable conditions on any disclosures to ensure that the information is \nnot inadvertently released to others or used for any purpose other than the assistance \nof class members, the final order will require Defendants to provide the identifying \ninformation that Plaintiffs request. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor over nine years, the parties have been engaged in litigation over the \nunconstitutional provisions of Michiganโs sex offender registry. It is past time for this \nlitigation to come to an end. The court has determined that the possibility of future \nprosecutions for violations of the old SORA statute require the entry of a final judgment \neven though the judgment will not affect the enforcement of the new SORA statute \nenacted in March of 2021. And, the court has determined that the best, and most \nefficient, course is for a final judgment to be entered in the present litigation. The court \nalso finds that it is appropriate to include the interim order in the final judgment for the \nsake of clarity and that Defendants must provide Plaintiffs with a complete class list for \nthe purpose of post-judgment monitoring. Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ โMotion for Judgmentโ (ECF No. 99) is \nGRANTED IN PART. \n \nhas already been certified. And, in any event, Defendantsโ argument against disclosure \ndoes not raise this issue.  \n22 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2465   Filed 06/21/21   Page 23 of 23\nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ โAmended Motion for Judgmentโ (ECF No. 107) is \nGRANTED IN PART. \nIT IS ORDERED that Defendantsโ โMotion to Clarify Injunctionโ (ECF No. 107) is \nDENIED.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties in the next 21 days must meet and \nconfer on the contents of the final judgment. Plaintiffs must submit a joint, proposed \nform of judgment encapsulating these rulings by July 12, 2021. \n \ns/Robert H. Cleland                          / \nROBERT H.

On \nFebruary 14, 2020, this court entered an opinion invalidating portions of Michiganโs \nSORA statute as a result of various constitutional violations. (ECF No. 84.) Due to the \nemerging Coronavirus pandemic (โCOVID-19โ), in April 2020 the court entered an \nโInterim Order Delaying Entry of Final Judgmentโ that preliminarily enjoined the \nreporting requirements of Michiganโs sex offender registry. (ECF No. 91.) Pending \nbefore the court are Plaintiffsโ two motions requesting the entry of a final judgment in the \ncase.1  (ECF Nos. 99, 107.) Defendants have also filed a competing motion requesting \nthe entry of an order โclarifyingโ and extending the interim injunction already in place. \n(ECF No. 113.) The motions have been fully briefed, and the court concludes that a \n \n1   Plaintiffs filed an amended motion requesting the entry of a final judgment in \nJanuary 2021 because parts of its original motion for judgment (ECF No. 99), were \nmooted by the passage of Michiganโs Public Act 295 (โnew SORAโ). \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2444   Filed 06/21/21   Page 2 of 23\nhearing is not necessary. See E.D. Mich. LR  7.1(f)(2). For the reasons explained \nbelow, the court will grant Plaintiffsโ motions, in part, and deny Defendantsโ motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural History \n  This case has a long and complex procedural history which the court \nsummarizes below. After a previous constitutional challenge to SORA resulted in parts \nof the statute being declared unconstitutional, Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696, 706 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (โDoes Iโ), Plaintiffs brought the present class action again challenging \nthe constitutionality of parts of the SORA statute. John Doe et al. v. Snyder, No. 16-\n13137 (E.D. Mich.) (โDoes IIโ). \nThe Does II second amended complaint contains four counts:  \n(1) a due process challenge based on vagueness to the following \nprovisions SORA: \n \n(a) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(b) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734; \n \n(c) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735; \n \n(d) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely \nused by the individual, Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(e) the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and \ninstant message addresses . . . routinely used by the individual,โ \nMich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(l); and  \n \n(f) the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง \n2 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2445   Filed 06/21/21   Page 3 of 23\n28.727(1)(j). \n \n(2) a due process challenge based on SORAโs imposition of a strict liability \nscheme for violations of the act; \n \n(3) a First Amendment challenge based on:  \n   \n(a) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes \nany electronic mail or instant message address, or any other \ndesignations used in internet communications or postings,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.725(1)(f); and  \n \n(b) the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registrationโs \nrequirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses assigned to the individual . . . and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยง 28.727(1)(i); and  \n \n(4) an ex post facto challenge based on Defendantsโ continued \nenforcement of the 2006 and 2011 amendments.  \n \n(ECF No. 34, PageID.384-87.) \n   \n  The certified class in Does II includes three distinct classes. Plaintiffs \ndefine the primary class as all people who are or will be subject to registration \nunder SORA. The primary class seeks relief on Count I (vagueness); Count II \n(strict liability) and Count III (First Amendment). (EFC No. 46, PageID.693.) The \nsubclasses seek relief on Count IV (ex post facto) and are defined as follows: \n(1) The โpre-2006 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before January 1, 2006, and who have committed no \nregisterable offense since.  \n \n(2) The โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration on or after January 1, 2006, but before April 12, 2011, and \nwho have committed no registerable offense since. \n3 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2446   Filed 06/21/21   Page 4 of 23\n(Id.) \n  On February 14, 2021, the court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for partial \nsummary judgment in Does II. (ECF No. 84.) The court first held that the 2011 \namendments to SORA constituted an ex-post-facto punishment that โcannot be \nsevered from the statuteโ so โSORA in toto cannot be applied to any members of \nthe ex post facto subclassesโ who were convicted before enactment of the 2011 \namendment. (Id., PageID.1797.) The court also found several other SORA \nprovisions were unconstitutional as to the primary classโsex-offenders who \nwere convicted after enactment of the 2011 amendment. (Id., PageID.1802.) \nSpecifically, the court held: \nConsistent with the courtโs reasoning and findings in Does I, the following \nprovisions for SORA will be declared unconstitutional as to all registrants: \n \n(a) Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \n(1) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(2) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(3) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735;  \n \n(4) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers  . . .  routinely \nused by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(5) the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, \nregistration number, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, \nor vessel . . . regularly operated by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \n     (b) Provisions Void for Strict Liability: \n  \n4 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2447   Filed 06/21/21   Page 5 of 23\n(1) under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, SORA \nmust be interpreted as incorporating a knowledge requirement. \n \n(c) Provisions Void under the First Amendment: \n \n(1) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes \nany electronic mail or instant message address, or any other \ndesignations used in internet communications or postings,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.725(1)(f);  \n \n(2) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely \nused by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(3) the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and \ninstant message addresses . . . routinely used by the individual, \nMich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(l); \n \n(4) the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registrationโs \nrequirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses assigned to the individual . . . and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(i). \n(Id., PageID.1802-03.) And the court found that the Michigan State Police SOR Unit \nshould be required to provide โnotice of the relief granted in [the courtโs] order to all \nSORA registrants, law enforcement officials, and prosecuting attorneys.โ  (Id., \nPageID.1803-04.)  \nIn order to effectuate its decision, the court ordered โthat Plaintiffs submit a joint, \nproposed form of judgment encapsulating these rulings by March 13, 2020.โ (Id., \nPageID.1808.) The parties were unable to carry out this directive, however, before \nCOVID-19 shut down much of the state only a few weeks after the opinion was issued; \nmaking it โeffectively impossible [to enter] a final order providing complete relief.โ (ECF \nNo. 91, PageID.1847.) As a temporary solution to address the uncertainty created by \n5 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2448   Filed 06/21/21   Page 6 of 23\nthe courtโs ruling, in April 2020, the court entered an โInterim Order Delaying Entry of \nFinal Judgment, Preliminarily Enjoining Reporting Requirements, and Directing \nPublication.โ (ECF No. 91.) \nThe interim order suspended in-person reporting requirements for all sex \noffenders in the primary class during the state of emergency because the โCOVID-19 \npandemic makes in-person compliance with SORA effectively impossible.โ (Id., \nPageID.1849.) And it suspended โenforce[ment of] registration, verification, school \nzone, and fee violations of SORA that occurred or may occur from February 14, 2020, \nuntil the current crisis has ended, and thereafter until registrants are notified of what \nduties they have under SORA going forward.โ (Id., PageID.1850.) \nWhile the interim order remained in place, on December 31, 2020, the Michigan \nLegislature passed Public Act 295 (โnew SORAโ) which adopted numerous \namendments to Michiganโs SORA statute designed to address the constitutional \ninfirmities that this court found in the registry. (ECF No. 113, PageID.2294.) The new \nSORA became effective March 24, 2021, and all parties acknowledge that the new \nSORA removes or modifies all provisions that this court found to be unconstitutional in \nits February 14, 2021 opinion in Does II. (See Id., PageID.2295-99; ECF No. 107, \nPageID.2144.) While Plaintiffs comment that the new SORA also contains \nunconstitutional provisions and that โin some respects [the change] makes the law even \nmore punitive and unclear,โ they concede that challenges to the new version will need \nto be addressed in a subsequent and separate lawsuit, and contend that the court \nshould still enter a final judgment in this case. (ECF No. 107, PageID.2144-45.) \n6 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2449   Filed 06/21/21   Page 7 of 23\nDefendants, however, continue to argue that the court should not enter a final judgment \nin the case until a related lawsuit that is currently pending before the Michigan Supreme \nCourt is decided. (See ECF 110.) \nB. Related Michigan Supreme Court Case \nDefendantsโ briefs point to and rely upon an appeal in a criminal case now before \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 (Mich.). Betts involves a \ncriminal defendant who challenges his conviction of failing to register under SORA. \nDefendant/Appellant Betts was convicted in 1994 for the crime subjecting him to SORA \nregistration. (ECF No. 84, PageID.1784 n.2.) The Michigan Supreme Court granted \nleave to appeal and issued a briefing order directing the parties to address the following \nissues: \n(1) whether the requirements of the Sex Offenders Registration Act \n(SORA), MCL 28.721 et seq., taken as a whole, amount to โpunishmentโ \nfor purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Michigan and United \nStates Constitutions;  \n \n(2) if SORA, as a whole, constitutes punishment, whether it became \npunitive only upon the enactment of a certain provision or group of \nprovisions added after the initial version of SORA was enacted;  \n \n(3) if SORA only became punitive after a particular enactment, whether a \nresulting ex post facto violation would be remedied by applying the version \nof SORA in effect before it transformed into a punishment or whether a \ndifferent remedy applies;  \n \n(4) if one or more discrete provisions of SORA, or groups of provisions, \nare found to be ex post facto punishments, whether the remaining \nprovisions can be given effect retroactively without applying the ex post \nfacto provisions;  \n \n(5) what consequences would arise if the remaining provisions could not \nbe given retroactive effect; and  \n \n7 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2450   Filed 06/21/21   Page 8 of 23\n(6) whether the answers to these questions require the reversal of the \ndefendantโs conviction pursuant to MCL 28.729 for failure to register under \nSORA. \n \n(ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979โ80.) The Betts court has still not reached a decision \nin the case, and in February 2021, the state filed a supplemental brief. (See ECF \nNo. 110-1.) The brief requests that the court also decide if the new version of \nSORA, that became effective in March 2021, should be applied retroactively to \nthe conduct of registrants that occurred before the statuteโs enactment.  \nII. ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT  \nA. Mootness \nNow that the Legislature has amended Michiganโs sex offender registry to \nremove the provisions found unconstitutional in Does I and Does II, the parties first \ncontest whether the entry of a final judgment is necessary or if the case is now moot.  \nโ[A] case is moot, [when the court] lack[s] jurisdiction to proceed. Ramsek v. \nBeshear, 989 F.3d 494, 499 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Ohio v. EPA, 969 F.3d 306, 308 (6th \nCir. 2020) (โ[U]nder Article III, the โfederal courts are without power to decide questions \nthat cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.โโ)) (quotations omitted). \nโTo assess whether a case is moot, [the court must] ask โwhether the relief sought \nwould, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.โโ Id. (citing \nMcPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (en \nbanc)). \nThe parties essentially agree that the question of mootness turns on whether the \nnew SORA statute applies retroactively to conduct that occurred before the statuteโs \n8 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2451   Filed 06/21/21   Page 9 of 23\nenactment. To make their arguments, the parties rely on two separate principles of \nMichigan law that deal with the retroactive application of statutes after they are modified \nby the Legislature.  \nThe first principle is that changes to a statute, by default, operate prospectively. \nPeople v. Russo, 439 Mich. 584, 594, 487 N.W.2d 698, 702 (1992) (โThe general rule of \nstatutory construction in Michigan is that a new or amended statute applies \nprospectively unless the Legislature has expressly or impliedly indicated its intention to \ngive it retrospective effect.โ) Due to this prospective orientation, the legislature has \nenacted what is referred to as the โgeneral savings clauseโ which provides that โthe \nrepeal of any statute or part thereof shall not have the effect to release or relinquish any \npenalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute. . . unless the repealing act \nshall so expressly provide.โ Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. ยง 8.4a (emphasis added). For all \npractical purposes, this means that an individual can be held criminally liable for past \nviolations of a repealed/amended statute.2  \nThe second Michigan retroactivity doctrine at issue is the concept of \namelioration. The seminal Michigan case on the concept of amelioration is a plurality \nopinion in People v. Schultz, 435 Mich. 517, 520, 460 N.W.2d 505, 506 (1990). In \nSchultz, a defendant was convicted of possession of a large quantity of cocaine. Id. at \n \n2   Plaintiffsโ briefing succinctly summarizes how this โsavings clauseโ was enacted \nto prevent a situation where the modification of a statute would mean that a past \ncriminal violation would go unpunished because the enactment of the new statute \nrepealed an old statute but the new statute, for ex-post facto reasons, could not be \napplied retroactively. (See ECF No. 112, PageID.2248 (citing People v. Lowell, 230 \nN.W. 202, 203-04 (Mich. 1930).) \n9 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2452   Filed 06/21/21   Page 10 of 23\n507. And he was โsentenced to twenty to thirty years imprisonmentโ as the statute \nrequired โa mandatory twenty-year minimum term of imprisonment.โ Id. However, while \ndefendantโs conviction was on appeal, a new statute โreduced the mandatory minimum \nterm of imprisonment from twenty years to ten.โ Id. While the prosecution argued โthat \nboth the action to enforce criminal liability and the terms of punishment authorized in the \nstatutes prior to amendment remain in effect by operation of the general saving statute, \nM.C.L. ยง 8.4a,โ the Michigan Supreme Court held that section 8.4a โdoes indicate that \nconduct remains subject to punishmentโ but it โdoes notโ apply โwhere an amendatory \nact mitigates the authorized terms of punishment but continues to proscribe the same \nconduct.โ Id. at 509-10 (emphasis added).  \nThe ameliorative effect clearly applies when โa new, identical statuteโ is passed \nthat simply reduces the minimum sentence; however, the Michigan Court of Appeals \nhas found a legislative act that makes further modifications to a criminal statute cannot \nbe interpreted as to have retroactive effect without creating potential ex post facto \nconstitutional violations. See People v. Doxey, 263 Mich. App. 115, 120, 687 N.W.2d \n360, 363-64 (2004) (finding that the amelioration principle did not apply to a statute that \nโnot only amelioratively amended the sentencing provision of the statute, but also \nchanged the breakdown of the prohibited conduct contained in the statute, including the \naddition of a new crime of delivery of over 100 gramsโ)   \nApplying these principles, Defendants argue that the changes to SORA \nregulations contained in the new statute should โapply retroactively.โ (ECF No. 110, \nPageID.2174.) Defendants reason that โ[i]f the full measure of the reporting obligations \n10 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2453   Filed 06/21/21   Page 11 of 23\nand student safety zone restrictions under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act \nconstitute punishment, then the Legislatureโs act in reducing some of these dutiesโ\ne.g., allowing for a method of reporting other than in-person for certain minor changes \nand eliminating the student safety zones in totalโis ameliorative and operates \nretroactively for pending cases.โ (Id.) To support their theory, Defendants argue that \nwhile the โunrevised SORA constitute[d] [a] punishment,โ the โrevised SORA is now. . . \nfully regulatory and non-punitive so it can be applied retroactively without raising new \nex-post facto constitutional concerns.โ (Id., PageID.2180-82 (โ[T]he Legislature has \npruned [the] punitive elementsโ of the old SORA โleaving again a true regulatory \nschemeโ).) Defendants contend that registrants who violated provisions of the old \nSORA, which this court previously found unconstitutional, could not be prosecuted \ngoing forward for such violations due to the new SORAโs retroactive nature. And \nthereby has the case become moot. (Id., PageID.2185 (โโ[T]he [new SORA] irrevocably \neradicated the effects of the alleged [constitutional] violation,โ there is no controversy left \nfor the court to decideโ).) \nPlaintiffs reject this analysis. They contend that โ[u]nder clear state statutory and \ncase law, criminal liability is governed by the law in effect when the offense occurs. \nMoreover, the โameliorationโ doctrine does not apply because the punishment for SORA \nviolations is unchanged, and because any โameliorationโ in SORA 2021 goes to \npunishment for the underlying sex offense, not for alleged violations of SORA itself.โ \n(ECF No. 112, PageID.2253-54.) Plaintiffs contend that the present case โis not moot \nbecause anyone who committed a SORA compliance offense before March 24, 2021 \n11 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2454   Filed 06/21/21   Page 12 of 23\ncan still be prosecuted under the old SORA, and will remain liable until [Michiganโs] six-\nyear statute of limitations runs.โ (Id., PageID.2254.) Therefore, it argues that the entry of \na final judgment is required to prevent such prosecutions going forward. \nAfter review of the relevant case law, the court is inclined to adopt Plaintiffsโ \nmuch simpler approach. First, it is undisputed that Public Act 295 of 2020, which \nenacted the new version of SORA, does not expressly state that it should be applied \nretroactively, so the court is left to glean any such intent from the nature of the statutory \nprovisions. See Schultz, 460 N.W.2d at 512. While Defendants present an interesting \nargument for why the court should consider the new SORA to be only an ameliorative \nregulatory statute, at the same time they argue that the statute eliminates provisions of \nthe sex-offender registry the court has already found to be unconstitutional under the \nex-post facto clause. (See ECF No. 110, PageID.2182 (โ[T]he unrevised SORA is a \nregulatory scheme with some elements that have made it [a criminal] punitive [law]. . . \nthe Legislature has pruned those punitive elements. . . leaving again a true regulatory \nschemeโ).) By Defendantsโ own admission, this would be a novel application of the \nconcept of amelioration under Michigan law. (See id.) Michigan law does not allow \nDefendants to have it both ways.  \nPut simply, the present situation is much closer to Doxey then Schultz. The new \nSORA is not โa new, identical statuteโ that merely changes the punishment for a specific \noffense, see Doxey, 687 N.W.2d at 363, instead it eliminated entire provisions, like the \nschool safety zone requirement that the court found to be criminal in nature. \nFurthermore, just as in Doxey, Defendantsโ interpretation would raise new ex post facto \n12 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2455   Filed 06/21/21   Page 13 of 23\nconcerns because the new SORA also modified at least some reporting requirements. \nSee id. at 364. (See ECF No. 112, PageID.2256 (citing M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(h); ยง \n28.722(g)) (highlighting that the new SORA broadens what telephone numbers and \ninternet identifiers must be reported by registrants).) Michigan precedent finds thatโ\nabsent an express declaration of retroactive intent by the Legislatureโwhen one \ninterpretation raises significant ex post facto concerns, the court should hew to an \ninterpretation that does not raise such concerns. Id. Consequently, the court concludes \nthat the new version of SORA applies only to registrantsโ conduct on or after March 24, \n2021.  \nB. Preclusive Effects of the Final Judgment \nIn the alternative, Defendants argue that the court should not rule on the new \nSORAโs retroactivityโor should at least hold off on such a rulingโbecause the \nMichigan Supreme Court could decide the same issue. People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 \n(Mich.) (ECF No. 110, PageID.2188-92.) The court is not convinced, as a matter of law \nor as a practical matter, that further delay is justified.   \nThe retroactive application of the new SORA statute was not among the six \nquestions the Supreme Court stated it would consider when, in June 2019, it granted \nleave to appeal in the Betts case. (ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979-80.) Defendants, \nhowever, did raise the issue in a supplemental brief it filed in Betts in February 2021, so \nthe Court could potentially weigh in. (See ECF No. 110-1.) \nThis courtโs previous ruling on the question of certification, involving a slightly \ndifferent retroactivity question, in its February 2020 opinion rejects many of the same \n13 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2456   Filed 06/21/21   Page 14 of 23\narguments that Defendants now raise. (See No. 84.) As the court pointed out, โthe \nissues in Betts are not identical to the remaining questions of law in this case.โ (Id., \nPageID.1791.) And the Betts court may not even decide all the questions before it in \nBetts. (See id.) This court does not view the application of either Section 8.4a or the \nstateโs amelioration doctrine to be an unsettled area of Michigan law, even if \nDefendantsโ own arguments on the topic appear novel. So, there is no unsettled \nquestion of law that alone justifies continued delay in the resolution of a case that has \nalready resulted in over nine years of combined litigation. Furthermore, it is important to \nremember that Michigan Supreme Court is under no obligation to hear the case at all. In \nlight of this courtโs February 2020 ruling and enactment of the new SORA, it is possible \nthat the Court could now simply vacate its order, reject the appeal, and reach no \ndecision on the matter. \nFrom a practical perspective, a Michigan Supreme Court ruling on whether the \nnew SORA can be applied retroactively is unlikely to have any impact if issued after this \ncourt enters a final judgment. If the Betts court reaches the question of retroactivity and \nconcurs in this courtโs holdingโthat the new version of SORA should not be applied \nretroactively to conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021โthen nothing changes \nbecause this court has already found the disputed provisions of the old SORA statute to \nbe unconstitutional on Federal grounds. If the Betts court reaches the question and \nconcludes the oppositeโholding that the new SORA applied retroactively and \nameliorated SORAโs old, unconstitutional provisionsโthen Defendants still cannot be \ncharged for violations of the disputed provisions of the old SORA. (See ECF No. 110, \n14 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2457   Filed 06/21/21   Page 15 of 23\nPageID.2181 (Defendants charting the โtiming of offenseโ and the โapplicable version of \nSORAโ).) So, as a practical matter, nothing would change for the class members.3 If, on \nthe other hand, this court waited for the Michigan Supreme Court to issue a ruling, the \nclass members could be left with the current confusion while awaiting a Michigan \nSupreme Court decision that may never come. For all these reasons, the court \nconcludes that a further delay in the entry of a final judgment is inappropriate. \nIII. CONTENTS OF FINAL JUDGMENT  \nThe parties also continue to disagree on the contents of the final judgment. The \nissues have been fully briefed, and the court will now address the most pressing \ndisputes.4 \nA. Incorporation of the Interim Order \nThe partiesโ positions regarding the incorporation of the interim orderโwhereby \nthe court suspended the entry of only the final judgmentโhave evolved over multiple \nrounds of briefing. Plaintiffs initially proposed that the text of the final judgment should \ncontain a paragraph โincorporat[ing] this Courtโs interim order barring enforcement of \nregistration, verification, school zone, and fee violations of [old] SORA that occurred \n[after] February 14, 2020.โ (ECF No. 99, PageID.1891.) The Plaintiffs contended that \nincorporation would serve two purposes, (1) it would clarify โthat the final order \n \n3   As this court has previously noted, if the Michigan Supreme Courtsโ ruling โruns \nsomehow contrary to this courtโs determination, this court can modify its judgment to \nconform to Bettsโ though Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). (ECF No. 84, \nPageID.1792 n.6.) \n4   Given the partiesโ joint representations in a recent telephonic status conference, \nthe court is confident that the parties can work together to resolve any remaining issues \nregarding the contents of the final judgment not directly addressed by this opinion.  \n15 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2458   Filed 06/21/21   Page 16 of 23\nsupersedes the interim order,โ and (2) the proposed language would require that \nregistrants could not be prosecuted for any violations of SORA until โthey received \nnoticeโ of the courtโs ruling. (Id.) \nFollowing the enactment of the new SORA, which became effective on March 24, \n2021, Plaintiffs concede that the interim order does not prevent the enforcement of the \nnew SORA statute effective March 24, 2021. (See ECF No. 115, PageID.2328.) And \nthey concede that COVID-19 no longer impedes registrantsโ ability to โfulfill their SORA \nduties.โ (Id., PageID.2334.) Plaintiffs now propose that the final judgment should include \nlanguage expressly incorporating the courtโs interim order to ensure that registrants will \nnot be prosecuted for violations that occurred while the interim order was in effect. (Id., \nPageID.2338-39.) \n  Defendants agree that the registrants should be informed that the interim order \nโhas no bearing on the amended SORAโ and therefore โdoes not impinge on the ability \nof the State Defendants to enforce the 2021 SORA for conduct that occurs on or after \nMarch 24, 2021.โ (ECF No. 117, PageID.2352.) Defendants opposed the entry of final \njudgmentโas discussed at length in Section IIโ so they propose that the court should \ninstead amend the existing interim order to โclarify that the April 6, 2020 interim \ninjunction does not bar the State Defendants from enforcing the [new] SORA.โ (ECF No. \n113, PageID.2288.)  \n  Because the court has already decided to enter a final judgment, it finds no need \nfor a separate order โclarifyingโ the interim order. Further, the court finds that the \nexpress incorporation of the interim order into the final judgment will simplify the \n16 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2459   Filed 06/21/21   Page 17 of 23\nsituation going forward for both registrants and law enforcement. The final order will \nprovide a single document defining what violations of the old SORA can be prosecuted \nin the future. Such finality is clearly needed as it appears some registrants and law \nenforcement agencies apparently do not understand the full effect of the interim order. \n(See, e.g., ECF Nos. 112-2, 112-3, 112-4, PageID.2274-82 (Attorneys Mannikko, Ryan, \nand White attesting that some law enforcement agencies have continued to charge \nregistrants for SORA violations that occurred in 2020 while the interim order was in \neffect).)   \nB. Disclosure of Class Information \nDue to the extraordinary procedural posture of this class action, no complete \nclass list has ever been provided to Plaintiffsโ counsel. (ECF No. 99, PageID.1892.) \nBoth sides agree that a class list should be provided, but a dispute remains over what \nshould be included. (ECF No. 107, PageID.2151.) Plaintiffs argue that in order to fulfill \ntheir duties as class counsel, they should be given complete personal information for all \nclass membersโregardless of whether the individual is listed in Michiganโs publicly \naccessible sex offender databaseโand class counsel additionally requests they be \nprovided contact information (phone number and primary email address) for all class \nmembers even though such information is not contained in the publicly accessible \ndatabase. (See ECF No. 99, PageID.1865-96; ECF No. 103, PageID.2083.) Class \ncounsel argues that access to this information is needed so they can efficiently respond \nto the inevitable flood of inquiries from individual class members regarding their \nregistration status after the final judgment is entered. (Id.) \n17 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2460   Filed 06/21/21   Page 18 of 23\nDefendants argue, however, that the confidentiality requirements in Michigan \nstatute prevent them from providing such a complete list. (ECF No. 101, PageID.1947-\n55.) While Defendants have agreed to provide addressees, basic demographic and \noffense information contained in Michiganโs public sex offender registry (PSOR), \nDefendants argue they โare not authorized to disclose information regarding non-public \noffenders, i.e., any offender or offender information not authorized for disclosure in the \nPSOR under [Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.728(2)].โ (Id., PageID.1950.) These include \nโindividuals registered solely because they were subject to an order in a juvenile matter \nin another state or country.โ (Id. (citing Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.728(4)).) Further, \nDefendants contend that they are barred from disclosing phone numbers and primary \nemail address for all class members, even those listed in the PSOR because โ[n]on-\npublic information in the law enforcement database is confidential and is not open to \ninspection except for law enforcement purposes.โ (Id., PageID.1951 (citing Mich. Comp. \nLaws ยง 28.730).) Defendants also cite โthe Criminal Justice Information Systems Policy \nCouncil Actโ and argue this statute bars such a disclosure by government officials. (Id. \n(citing Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214).) \nIn response, Plaintiffs argue that the โ[t]he statutes [Defendants] rely upon. . . \nprovide no succor for [Defendants] claimโ that โthey are legally barred from providing \nany non-public information.โ (ECF No. 103, PageID.2084.) In support of their view, \nPlaintiffs rely on Dupuie-Jarbo v. Twenty-Eighth Dist. Ct., a previous decision by this \ncourt interpreting MCL ยง 28.214, and People v. Malkowski, a Michigan Supreme Court \nruling, which found that another Michigan statuteโs confidentiality provision allowed the \n18 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2461   Filed 06/21/21   Page 19 of 23\ndisclosure of presentence reports to defense counsel. (Id., PageID.2084-85 (citing No. \n10-10548, 2010 WL 2813343, at *2 (E.D. Mich. July 14, 2010) (Cleland, J.); 188 N.W.2d \n559, 560 n.1 (Mich. 1971).)  \nThe court finds that Plaintiffsโ view more accurately reflects Michiganโs law \ngoverning such disclosures. Because the court finds that the statutes cited by \nDefendants do not bar the court from requiring such a disclosure to class counsel, \nDefendants must provide information on class members not in the PSOR database and \nadditional contact information for all class members.5  \nFirst, the Sixth Circuit has held that โ[t]he Federal Rules expressly authorize \ndiscovery โ[i]n aid of [a] judgmentโโ including โbroad. . . postjudgment discoveryโ to \nmonitor โcompliance with the court's judgment and award of injunctive relief.โ See \nUnited States v. Conces, 507 F.3d 1028, 1039-40 (6th Cir. 2007). So, as a general \nmatter, this court has authority to require that Defendants produce information narrowly \ntailored to the enforcement of its judgment. See id. The court finds that a limited \ndisclosure of personal information identifying class members is necessary to ensure that \nthe courtโs award of injunctive relief is properly enforced for all members of the certified \nclass.   \nIn Dupue-Jarbo this court considered a Michigan District Courtโs argument that it \nshould not have to disclose information โfrom criminal justice information systemsโ as \npart of a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against it in federal court โbecause it would \n \n5   The parties should include a deadline by which Defendants must turn over a \ncomplete class list within the proposed final judgment. \n19 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2462   Filed 06/21/21   Page 20 of 23\nbe a state crime to produceโ the information under Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214. 2010 \nWL 2813343, at *2. This court flatly rejected such an interpretation of the statute. Id. \nBecause the disclosure of such information was relevant to ongoing discovery under the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court found that โDefendantsโ production of the \ncriminal history reports would be โauthorized by . . . ruleโ and it would not be a crime \nunder Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214 [(5)] for Defendants to produce them.โ Id. This \ninterpretation informs the present dispute. Since the court has authority toโand will \nrequireโthe disclosure of such requested class information through its post-judgment \nauthority under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the disclosure cannot be \nconsidered a criminal violation of Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214. \nThe closer question is whether the SORA statute itself allows the disclosure of \nthe requested information. SORA provides that โa registration or report is confidential \nand information from that registration or report shall not be open to inspection except for \nlaw enforcement purposes. . . all included materials and information are exempt from \ndisclosure under. . . the freedom of information act.โ Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.730. The \nstatute also states that โ[e]xcept as provided in this act, an individual other than the \nregistrant who knows of a registration or report under this act and who divulges, uses, \nor publishes nonpublic information concerning the registration or report in violation of \nthis act is guilty of a misdemeanor.โ Id. The statute does not explicitly contemplate the \ndisclosure of a registrantโs information to his own attorney.  \nPlaintiffs correctly observe that the Michigan Supreme court has dealt with an \nanalogous question before in Malkowski. 385 Mich. 244, 246, 188 N.W.2d 559, 560 \n20 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2463   Filed 06/21/21   Page 21 of 23\n(1971). The Malkowski court noted that the language of the then-applicable statute \ngoverning the disclosure of presentence reports โprovide[ed] that reports of \ninvestigations by probation officers are declared to be privileged or confidential \ncommunications not open to public inspection.โ Id. at 560 n.1 (quotation omitted). \nBecause the statute stated that its intent was to protect โthe relation of confidence \nbetween the probation officer and probationer or defendant under investigation,โ the \ncourt held that โ[i]n view of the legislative intent, this provision should not be construed \nto deny access by either a defendant or his attorney to presentence reports.โ Id. \nTherefore, the court found that the state was also required to provide attorneys access \nto the presentence reports. Id. \nThe general rule that can be drawn from Malkowski is that, absent explicit \nlanguage to the contrary, the court should presume that reports available to an \nindividual directly can also be provided to his counsel even when the public at large is \nbarred from accessing such information. See id. When viewed in toto, one of the \npurposes of Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.730 is the protection of a registrantโs privacy. The \ncourt simply does not believe that Defendantsโ reading of the statute in the present \ncaseโwhich would bar the disclosure of any non-public registration information to a \nregistrantโs counselโconforms with a statute which plainly contemplates registrants \nhaving access to the information for their own purposes.6  \n \n6 To be sure, the disclosure of class list information to class counsel can sometimes \nraise unique privacy concerns, especially at the pre-certification stage. See, e.g., Martin \nv. Sysco Corp., No. 116CV00990DADSAB, 2017 WL 4517819, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. \n10, 2017) (limiting the scope of disclosures to class counsel at the pre-certification stage \nto protect to preserve class memberโs privacy). Such concerns are reduced after a class \n21 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2464   Filed 06/21/21   Page 22 of 23\nTo summarize, the court finds that neither of the statutes cited by Defendants \nactually prevent them from disclosing to class counsel non-public registrant information \nfor registrants who are already members of the certified class. While Defendants are \nfree to put reasonable conditions on any disclosures to ensure that the information is \nnot inadvertently released to others or used for any purpose other than the assistance \nof class members, the final order will require Defendants to provide the identifying \ninformation that Plaintiffs request. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor over nine years, the parties have been engaged in litigation over the \nunconstitutional provisions of Michiganโs sex offender registry. It is past time for this \nlitigation to come to an end. The court has determined that the possibility of future \nprosecutions for violations of the old SORA statute require the entry of a final judgment \neven though the judgment will not affect the enforcement of the new SORA statute \nenacted in March of 2021. And, the court has determined that the best, and most \nefficient, course is for a final judgment to be entered in the present litigation. The court \nalso finds that it is appropriate to include the interim order in the final judgment for the \nsake of clarity and that Defendants must provide Plaintiffs with a complete class list for \nthe purpose of post-judgment monitoring. Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ โMotion for Judgmentโ (ECF No. 99) is \nGRANTED IN PART. \n \nhas already been certified. And, in any event, Defendantsโ argument against disclosure \ndoes not raise this issue.  \n22 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2465   Filed 06/21/21   Page 23 of 23\nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ โAmended Motion for Judgmentโ (ECF No. 107) is \nGRANTED IN PART. \nIT IS ORDERED that Defendantsโ โMotion to Clarify Injunctionโ (ECF No. 107) is \nDENIED.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties in the next 21 days must meet and \nconfer on the contents of the final judgment. Plaintiffs must submit a joint, proposed \nform of judgment encapsulating these rulings by July 12, 2021. \n \ns/Robert H. Cleland                          / \nROBERT H.

Comp. Laws ยง 28.721 et seq., in effect at the \ntime (โpre-2021 SORAโ or โold SORAโ); \nWhereas this Court on September 11, 2018, entered a stipulated order certi-\nfying a primary class of all people required to be registered under Michiganโs pre-\n2021 SORA, and two โex post factoโ subclasses of individuals with offenses pre-\ndating January 1, 2006, and April 12, 2011, R. 46; \nWhereas this Court on May 23, 2019, entered a stipulated order declaring the \n2006 and 2011 SORA amendments to be unconstitutional as to the ex post facto \n1 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2567   Filed 08/26/21   Page 2 of 10\nsubclasses, R. 55; \nWhereas  this  Court  on  February  14,  2020,  issued  an  opinion  and  order \ngranting Plaintiffsโ motions for summary judgment as to Counts I through IV of the \nsecond amended complaint, and ordered Defendants to provide notice of the Courtโs \nruling to all registrants, and all law enforcement officials and prosecuting attorneys \ntasked with the enforcement of SORA, R. 34; \nWhereas this Court on April 6, 2020, subsequently entered an interim order \nsuspending both enforcement of the old SORA and entry of the final judgment \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, R. 91; \nWhereas the Michigan Legislature thereafter passed, and the Michigan gover-\nnor signed, Michigan Public Act 295 of 2020 (HB 5679), which repealed certain \nprovisions and amended other provisions of the old SORA and which took effect on \nMarch 24, 2021 (โnew SORAโ)1; \nWhereas this Court on June 21, 2021, issued an opinion and order granting in \npart Plaintiffsโ Motion for Judgment and Amended Motion for Judgment, R. 121; \nWhereas this Court entered a final judgment on August 4, 2021, R.124, based \non a proposed judgment provided by the parties; \n \n1  As used in this judgment, the โnew SORAโ refers to the version of Michiganโs \nSex Offenders Registration Act, M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq., in effect as of March 24, \n2021, including both sections that were and were not amended by Public Act 295 \nof 2020.   \n2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2568   Filed 08/26/21   Page 3 of 10\nWhereas the parties have informed the Court that there were two errors in the \njudgment they had presented, namely an incorrect effective date for the 2011 SORA \namendments, and an error related to a statutory citation; and \nWhereas the parties stipulate to amendment of the judgment and the subclass \ndefinition to reflect the correct effective date of the 2011 SORA amendments;  \nThis Court now enters an amended final judgment as follows: \n1.  IT IS ORDERED that the definition of the โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ \nis amended to be defined as members of the primary class who committed their \noffense or offenses requiring registration on or after January 1, 2006, but before July \n1, 2011, and who have committed no registrable offense since.2 \n \n2 Throughout this case, the parties have used April 12, 2011 as the effective date of \nthe 2011 amendments based on the partiesโ joint understanding that this was the \ncorrect effective date. That understanding was in turn based on the fact that the \nheader to the 2011 public act lists April 12, 2011 as the statuteโs effective date. See \n2011 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 17 at 1, https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-\n2012/publicact/pdf/2011-PA-0017.pdf. However, that effective date applies only to \nthe first enacting section of the public act, which amended Mich. Comp. Laws \nยง 28.725a. See id. at 10. The remaining amendments made by the public act, which \naddressed several other sections of the statute, went into effect July 1, 2011. See id.; \n2011 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 18 at 8, https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-\n2012/publicact/pdf/2011-PA-0018.pdf. The error came to the attention of the parties \nin  reviewing  the  new  statute,  which  uses  July  1,  2011  as  the  relevant  date \ndemarcating obligations that are not imposed on pre-2011 registrants. See, e.g., \nMich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.727(1)(i) (requiring registration of email addresses only for \nindividuals required to be registered after July 1, 2011). The Court finds that it is \nappropriate  to  correct  this  error,  as  the  Courtโs  legal  analysis  bars  retroactive \nenforcement of the old SORA to individuals whose offenses pre-date the 2011 \namendments, and the vast majority of those amendments were, in fact, effective on \nJuly 1, 2011.  \n3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2569   Filed 08/26/21   Page 4 of 10\n2.  IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for declaratory relief (R. 62) is \nGRANTED. Michiganโs pre-2021 SORA is DECLARED to be punishment. Thus, \nthe ex post facto application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments is DECLARED \nunconstitutional, the 2011 amendments are DECLARED not severable from the pre-\n2021 SORA, and the pre-2021 SORA is therefore DECLARED NULL AND VOID \nas applied to conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021 to members of the ex post \nfacto subclasses (defined as all people who are or will be subject to registration under \nSORA, who committed their offense or offenses requiring registration prior to July \n1, 2011, and who have committed no registrable offense since). This declaration \ndoes not prevent the enforcement of any provision in the new SORA (as defined \nabove and whose constitutionality was not at issue in this litigation) for conduct that \noccurs on or after March 24, 2021, against any registrant, including members of the \nex post facto subclasses.  \n3.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for injunctive relief (R. \n62) is GRANTED. Defendants and their agents are permanently ENJOINED from \nenforcing ANY provision in the pre-2021 SORA against members of the ex post \nfacto subclasses, for conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021. As the Legis-\nlature has now amended SORA, and as this litigation did not address the constitu-\ntionality of the new SORA (as defined above), this injunction does not enjoin \n4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2570   Filed 08/26/21   Page 5 of 10\nenforcement of any provision in the new SORA (as defined above) against members \nof the ex post facto subclasses.  \n4.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary \njudgment (R. 75) is GRANTED. The following provisions of the pre-2021 SORA \nare DECLARED unconstitutional, and Defendants and their agents are permanently \nENJOINED  from  enforcing  them  against  any  registrant  for  any  violation  that \noccurred before March 24, 2021: \n(a)   Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \ni.   the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich.

Comp.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that enactment of the new SORA does not moot \nthis case. Absent this judgment, registrants could face prosecution for conduct that \noccurred before March 24, 2021, under provisions of the old SORA that have been \nfound unconstitutional, or whose enforcement was barred while the Interim Order, \nR. 91, was in effect.  \n6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2572   Filed 08/26/21   Page 7 of 10\n6.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED (consistent with this Courtโs Interim Order \nDelaying Entry  of  Final  Judgment,  Preliminarily  Enjoining Reporting  Require-\nments, and Directing Publication, R. 91, and this Courtโs Opinion and Order holding \nthat registrants cannot be held strictly liable for old SORA violations, R. 84, which \nare incorporated by reference), that Defendants and their agents are permanently \nENJOINED from enforcing registration, verification, school zone, and fee violations \nof the old SORA that occurred from February 14, 2020, until March 24, 2021.

(This injunction does not prevent the \nenforcement of the new SORA (as defined above) for conduct that occurred on or \nafter March 24, 2021.)  \n7.

Therefore, the parties shall \nhave 7 days to submit a proposed order, or if they cannot agree, their respective \nproposed orders, regarding the provision of a class list plan for the Courtโs approval.  \n9.

Such  information  about \nindividual registrants shall not be used for any purpose other than to represent the \nindividual class members or the class.   \n10.    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  provision  of  the  above  information \npursuant to paragraphs 8 and 9 shall not be deemed a violation of any law or regula-\ntion that might otherwise be read to protect the confidentiality of such information, \nincluding Mich.

Hon. Robert H. Cleland \n \nGRETCHEN WHITMER, Governor of the    Mag. J. David R. Grand \nState of Michigan, and COL. JOSEPH \nGASPAR, Director of the Michigan State       \nPolice, in their official capacities        \n \n    Defendants. \n__________________________________________________________________ \n \nAMENDED FINAL JUDGMENT \n \nWhereas Plaintiffs filed a complaint in August 2016 and subsequently filed \namended complaints challenging the constitutionality of the version of Michiganโs \nSex Offenders Registration Act, Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.721 et seq., in effect at the \ntime (โpre-2021 SORAโ or โold SORAโ); \nWhereas this Court on September 11, 2018, entered a stipulated order certi-\nfying a primary class of all people required to be registered under Michiganโs pre-\n2021 SORA, and two โex post factoโ subclasses of individuals with offenses pre-\ndating January 1, 2006, and April 12, 2011, R. 46; \nWhereas this Court on May 23, 2019, entered a stipulated order declaring the \n2006 and 2011 SORA amendments to be unconstitutional as to the ex post facto \n1 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2567   Filed 08/26/21   Page 2 of 10\nsubclasses, R. 55; \nWhereas  this  Court  on  February  14,  2020,  issued  an  opinion  and  order \ngranting Plaintiffsโ motions for summary judgment as to Counts I through IV of the \nsecond amended complaint, and ordered Defendants to provide notice of the Courtโs \nruling to all registrants, and all law enforcement officials and prosecuting attorneys \ntasked with the enforcement of SORA, R. 34; \nWhereas this Court on April 6, 2020, subsequently entered an interim order \nsuspending both enforcement of the old SORA and entry of the final judgment \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, R. 91; \nWhereas the Michigan Legislature thereafter passed, and the Michigan gover-\nnor signed, Michigan Public Act 295 of 2020 (HB 5679), which repealed certain \nprovisions and amended other provisions of the old SORA and which took effect on \nMarch 24, 2021 (โnew SORAโ)1; \nWhereas this Court on June 21, 2021, issued an opinion and order granting in \npart Plaintiffsโ Motion for Judgment and Amended Motion for Judgment, R. 121; \nWhereas this Court entered a final judgment on August 4, 2021, R.124, based \non a proposed judgment provided by the parties; \n \n1  As used in this judgment, the โnew SORAโ refers to the version of Michiganโs \nSex Offenders Registration Act, M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq., in effect as of March 24, \n2021, including both sections that were and were not amended by Public Act 295 \nof 2020.   \n2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2568   Filed 08/26/21   Page 3 of 10\nWhereas the parties have informed the Court that there were two errors in the \njudgment they had presented, namely an incorrect effective date for the 2011 SORA \namendments, and an error related to a statutory citation; and \nWhereas the parties stipulate to amendment of the judgment and the subclass \ndefinition to reflect the correct effective date of the 2011 SORA amendments;  \nThis Court now enters an amended final judgment as follows: \n1.  IT IS ORDERED that the definition of the โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ \nis amended to be defined as members of the primary class who committed their \noffense or offenses requiring registration on or after January 1, 2006, but before July \n1, 2011, and who have committed no registrable offense since.2 \n \n2 Throughout this case, the parties have used April 12, 2011 as the effective date of \nthe 2011 amendments based on the partiesโ joint understanding that this was the \ncorrect effective date. That understanding was in turn based on the fact that the \nheader to the 2011 public act lists April 12, 2011 as the statuteโs effective date. See \n2011 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 17 at 1, https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-\n2012/publicact/pdf/2011-PA-0017.pdf. However, that effective date applies only to \nthe first enacting section of the public act, which amended Mich. Comp. Laws \nยง 28.725a. See id. at 10. The remaining amendments made by the public act, which \naddressed several other sections of the statute, went into effect July 1, 2011. See id.; \n2011 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 18 at 8, https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-\n2012/publicact/pdf/2011-PA-0018.pdf. The error came to the attention of the parties \nin  reviewing  the  new  statute,  which  uses  July  1,  2011  as  the  relevant  date \ndemarcating obligations that are not imposed on pre-2011 registrants. See, e.g., \nMich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.727(1)(i) (requiring registration of email addresses only for \nindividuals required to be registered after July 1, 2011). The Court finds that it is \nappropriate  to  correct  this  error,  as  the  Courtโs  legal  analysis  bars  retroactive \nenforcement of the old SORA to individuals whose offenses pre-date the 2011 \namendments, and the vast majority of those amendments were, in fact, effective on \nJuly 1, 2011.  \n3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2569   Filed 08/26/21   Page 4 of 10\n2.  IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for declaratory relief (R. 62) is \nGRANTED. Michiganโs pre-2021 SORA is DECLARED to be punishment. Thus, \nthe ex post facto application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments is DECLARED \nunconstitutional, the 2011 amendments are DECLARED not severable from the pre-\n2021 SORA, and the pre-2021 SORA is therefore DECLARED NULL AND VOID \nas applied to conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021 to members of the ex post \nfacto subclasses (defined as all people who are or will be subject to registration under \nSORA, who committed their offense or offenses requiring registration prior to July \n1, 2011, and who have committed no registrable offense since). This declaration \ndoes not prevent the enforcement of any provision in the new SORA (as defined \nabove and whose constitutionality was not at issue in this litigation) for conduct that \noccurs on or after March 24, 2021, against any registrant, including members of the \nex post facto subclasses.  \n3.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for injunctive relief (R. \n62) is GRANTED. Defendants and their agents are permanently ENJOINED from \nenforcing ANY provision in the pre-2021 SORA against members of the ex post \nfacto subclasses, for conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021. As the Legis-\nlature has now amended SORA, and as this litigation did not address the constitu-\ntionality of the new SORA (as defined above), this injunction does not enjoin \n4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2570   Filed 08/26/21   Page 5 of 10\nenforcement of any provision in the new SORA (as defined above) against members \nof the ex post facto subclasses.  \n4.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary \njudgment (R. 75) is GRANTED. The following provisions of the pre-2021 SORA \nare DECLARED unconstitutional, and Defendants and their agents are permanently \nENJOINED  from  enforcing  them  against  any  registrant  for  any  violation  that \noccurred before March 24, 2021: \n(a)   Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \ni.   the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich.

Comp.  Laws \nยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \n(b)  Provisions Void for Strict Liability: \n \ni.  under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the old SORA \nmust be interpreted as incorporating a knowledge requirement. \n \n(c)  Provisions Void under the First Amendment: \n5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2571   Filed 08/26/21   Page 6 of 10\n \ni.  the  requirement  to  โreport  in  person  and  notify  the  registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . .

Comp.  Laws \nยง 28.727(1)(i). \n \nAs this litigation did not address the constitutionality of the new SORA (as defined \nabove), this injunction does not enjoin enforcement of any provision in the new \nSORA (as defined above). \n  5. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that enactment of the new SORA does not moot \nthis case. Absent this judgment, registrants could face prosecution for conduct that \noccurred before March 24, 2021, under provisions of the old SORA that have been \nfound unconstitutional, or whose enforcement was barred while the Interim Order, \nR. 91, was in effect.  \n6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2572   Filed 08/26/21   Page 7 of 10\n6.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED (consistent with this Courtโs Interim Order \nDelaying Entry  of  Final  Judgment,  Preliminarily  Enjoining Reporting  Require-\nments, and Directing Publication, R. 91, and this Courtโs Opinion and Order holding \nthat registrants cannot be held strictly liable for old SORA violations, R. 84, which \nare incorporated by reference), that Defendants and their agents are permanently \nENJOINED from enforcing registration, verification, school zone, and fee violations \nof the old SORA that occurred from February 14, 2020, until March 24, 2021. The \nInterim Order, R. 91, is hereby terminated.  (This injunction does not prevent the \nenforcement of the new SORA (as defined above) for conduct that occurred on or \nafter March 24, 2021.)  \n7.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants shall PROVIDE NOTICE of \nthis judgment to all registrants and to all law enforcement officials and prosecuting \nattorneys tasked with the enforcement of SORA within the period of time stated in \nthe court-approved notice process. Within 7 days of entry of this judgment the \nparties shall submit for the Courtโs approval a joint proposed process for notice and \nproposed notices for registrants, prosecutors and law enforcement. If the parties \ncannot  agree,  they  shall  provide  their  respective  proposed  notice  process  and \nproposed notices. \n8.  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  to  enable  post-judgment  monitoring, \nDefendants shall provide class counsel with a class list and information about class \n7 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2573   Filed 08/26/21   Page 8 of 10\nmembers, consistent with this Courtโs June 21, 2021, Opinion and Order, R. 121. \nThe parties have informed the Court that, given the complexities associated with \nobtaining certain types of data, the parties need time to assess the capabilities of the \nSORA database to generate such data, and then time to discuss what information \nwill be provided, in what format, and on what timeline. Therefore, the parties shall \nhave 7 days to submit a proposed order, or if they cannot agree, their respective \nproposed orders, regarding the provision of a class list plan for the Courtโs approval.  \n9.   IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  any  non-public  information  about \nindividual registrants contained in the class list shall be confidential and shall not be \nfurther disclosed by class counsel, except that class counsel are authorized to share \nsuch  information  as  needed  to  resolve  an  individual  class  memberโs  situation, \nincluding with  that class  member  and  his/her  counsel.  Such  information  about \nindividual registrants shall not be used for any purpose other than to represent the \nindividual class members or the class.   \n10.    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  provision  of  the  above  information \npursuant to paragraphs 8 and 9 shall not be deemed a violation of any law or regula-\ntion that might otherwise be read to protect the confidentiality of such information, \nincluding Mich. Comp. Laws. ยงยง 28.214, 28.728, 28.730.  \n11.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in the interests of judicial economy and \nthe conservation of resources that might otherwise be expended on litigation as to \n8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 126, PageID.2574   Filed 08/26/21   Page 9 of 10\nattorneysโ fees and costs, the matter of attorneysโ fees is referred to the magistrate \njudge for a settlement conference. Within 60 days after the conclusion of all appeals \nin this case, Plaintiffs will present a demand for fees and costs, with appropriate \ndocumentation, to Defendants, and Defendants will have 21 days to respond, after \nwhich, if the parties have not reached agreement, the magistrate judge will hold a \nsettlement conference. If the parties are unable to resolve the attorney fee issues, the \nmagistrate judge shall notify the Court that negotiations and mediation have failed, \nand Plaintiffs will then have 60 days to file a petition for fees and costs.

Case No. 16-13137 \n     \nRICHARD SNYDER, et al.,   \n \n    Defendants. \n________________________________/ \n \nORDER FOR PROVIDING NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS,  \nPROSECUTORS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT1 \n \nA. Process for Notice to Registrants \n1.  The State Defendants shall provide notice in English and Spanish2 to all \nindividuals who are, or will be, required to register under Michiganโs Sex \nOffenders Registration Act, Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.721 et seq. (โSORAโ), \nincluding individuals with initial registrations pending review and processing by \nthe MSP SOR Unit who will be registered under SORA (collectively, \nโRegistrantsโ). The State Defendants shall not be required to provide notice to \nindividuals: (a) who are deceased; or (b) who were required to register in the \n \n1   This order is based on a โproposed orderโ jointly submitted by the parties. Since \nthe parties could not reach a complete agreement on certain terms (see ECF No. 127), \nthe court includes footnotes explaining its rationale for adopting specific language for \neach disputed provision. \n2   Plaintiffs will be responsible for translating the Registrant Notice, Incarcerated \nRegistrant Notice, and Registrant Notice for Posting into Spanish. Both the English and \nSpanish versions of these notices shall be formatted to fit on four pages each to permit \nboth notices to be printed on four sheets of paper total using double-sided printing. This \norder permits updating of website links and minor formatting adjustments to the court-\napproved notices as necessary to accommodate translation and to facilitate mailing and \nposting. \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 130, PageID.2649   Filed 10/22/21   Page 2 of 8\npast, but who are no longer subject to SORA (e.g., registration term has expired, \noffense no longer requires registration, removed by court order).3 See Mich. \nComp. Laws ยง 28.723 (identifying individuals required to be registered). \n \n3   Defendants argue that they โshould not be ordered to mail notice to out-of-state, \ninactive registrantsโ who are not currently subject to SORAโs reporting requirements \nunless they move back to Michigan. (See ECF No. 127, PageID.2586-89). Defendants \ncontend that providing notification to such registrants would be impractical due to \naddress staleness concerns, that the notice would be โof limited benefitโ to such class \nmembers, and that mailing a notice to stale addresses could potentially expose the \nDefendants to liability by revealing confidential information to a third party. (Id.) Plaintiffs \ndispute these points and argue that all class-member registrants, regardless of their \ncurrent residence are entitled to notice. The court largely concurs in Plaintiffโs \nassessment.  \n  The present class action was certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(1)(A) & 23(b)(2), (see ECF No. 46.), so the need for and scope of notice is a \nlargely discretionary determination left to the court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A) (โFor any \nclass certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appropriate notice to \nthe class.โ) (emphasis added). See also Lewis v. City of Chicago, Illinois, 702 F.3d 958, \n962 (7th Cir. 2012) (noting that โRule 23 [does not] require notice when a class action is \nresolved on the meritsโ). The court has already entered a stipulated judgment \nrequiringโbased on the courtโs discretionary authority under Rule 23(c)(2)(A)โthat \nDefendants provide notice โto all registrants.โ (ECF No. 126, PageID.2572.) The court \nfinds that the language of the final judgment already requires the notification of all \nregistrants, but the court notes Defendantโs objections to lack merit on their own terms. \nThe fact that some unknown, material percentage of registrants now residing out-of-\nstate will not receive the notification does not logically lead to the conclusion that other \nout-of-state registrants should be deprived of notification. And, if Defendants think the \nPostal Serviceโs change-of-address records will be inadequate, Defendants are free to \nvoluntarily mitigate this concern by using additional commercial address locations \nservices to increase the accuracy of its mailing. See, e.g., Del Carmen v. R.A. Rogers, \nInc., No. SA16CA971FBHJB, 2018 WL 6430835, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2018) \n(noting the use of โLexisNexis Accurint locate serviceโ to find class members).  \nFurthermore, the liability concerns raised by Defendants appear to be illusory as \nthey are not based in any case law or regulation. For any disclosure of confidential \ninformation to occur a third-party would need to first violate federal lawโby opening \nsomeone elseโs mail. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1702. In analogous class actions, where a \nnotification also contains highly private information, notices are still routinely mailed \nthroughout the country. See, e.g., In re Silicone Gel Breast Implant Prod. Liab. Litig., \nNo. CV 92โPโ10000โS, 1994 WL 114580, at *8 (N.D. Ala.

Any such list \nwill be provided in a searchable, manipulable format, such as an Excel \nspreadsheet, if available in that format. \nb.  For any Registrant Notice returned as undeliverable, but with a new \nforwarding address provided by USPS, the State Defendants will re-mail the \nnotice to the new forwarding address provided. Such re-mailing shall be \ncompleted within 120 days of the date of this order for any mail returned \nwithin 90 days of this orderโs issuance.

Within 90 days of the date of this order, the State Defendants shall, through the \nMichigan Department of Corrections (MDOC), provide notice to incarcerated \nRegistrants sentenced to the custody of the MDOC as follows: \na.  The State Defendants shall provide the MDOC with copies of Exhibit 2 \n(Incarcerated Registrant Notice)5 in English and Spanish for delivery or \nmailing, and posting, as well as a plain text version of Exhibit 2 for electronic \ndistribution via JPAY. \n \n4   Defendants argue that they should not be required to re-mail notices returned as \nundeliverable, even if a new forwarding address has been provided because it would be \na โsignificant undertaking and expenditure of State recourses.โ (ECF No. 127, \nPageID.2590.) Given the parameters put in place by this order, the court finds that \nDefendants concerns are unwarranted. This modified provision only requires that \nDefendants sort through notices returned before a certain date and re-mail notices in \nthe rare instance that a new forwarding address is readily apparent. Under the terms of \nthis order, Defendants can process mailing as they return, or alternatively, Defendants \ncan wait 90 days and collect all returned notices at once for batch processing. This will \nallow Defendants to utilize temporary workers or contractors to process returned \nnotifications if they so choose. Class notification in a case of this scope will always be a \nsomewhat arduous process. The ordered notification process is actually less time-\nconsuming than the notification process utilized in many other class actions. See, e.g., \nIn re MGM Mirage Sec. Litig., 708 F. App'x 894, 896 (9th Cir. 2017) (finding a claim \nadministratorโs mail notification processโthat included โre-mail[ing] notices returned as \nundeliverable after investigating the potential class members' alternative or updated \naddress information using private databases and address locator servicesโโwas a \nsufficient method for notifying 200,000 class members); Ontiveros v.

And the \ncourt notes that there are various service and equipment providers that can help \npartially automate the processing of undeliverable mail. Tracking the success of a mass \nmailing is a reasonable part of conducting such a class notification.  \n8 \n ",

Case No. 16-13137 \n     \nRICHARD SNYDER, et al.,   \n \n    Defendants. \n________________________________/ \n \nORDER FOR PROVIDING NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS,  \nPROSECUTORS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT1 \n \nA. Process for Notice to Registrants \n1.  The State Defendants shall provide notice in English and Spanish2 to all \nindividuals who are, or will be, required to register under Michiganโs Sex \nOffenders Registration Act, Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.721 et seq. (โSORAโ), \nincluding individuals with initial registrations pending review and processing by \nthe MSP SOR Unit who will be registered under SORA (collectively, \nโRegistrantsโ). The State Defendants shall not be required to provide notice to \nindividuals: (a) who are deceased; or (b) who were required to register in the \n \n1   This order is based on a โproposed orderโ jointly submitted by the parties. Since \nthe parties could not reach a complete agreement on certain terms (see ECF No. 127), \nthe court includes footnotes explaining its rationale for adopting specific language for \neach disputed provision. \n2   Plaintiffs will be responsible for translating the Registrant Notice, Incarcerated \nRegistrant Notice, and Registrant Notice for Posting into Spanish. Both the English and \nSpanish versions of these notices shall be formatted to fit on four pages each to permit \nboth notices to be printed on four sheets of paper total using double-sided printing. This \norder permits updating of website links and minor formatting adjustments to the court-\napproved notices as necessary to accommodate translation and to facilitate mailing and \nposting. \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 130, PageID.2649   Filed 10/22/21   Page 2 of 8\npast, but who are no longer subject to SORA (e.g., registration term has expired, \noffense no longer requires registration, removed by court order).3 See Mich. \nComp. Laws ยง 28.723 (identifying individuals required to be registered). \n \n3   Defendants argue that they โshould not be ordered to mail notice to out-of-state, \ninactive registrantsโ who are not currently subject to SORAโs reporting requirements \nunless they move back to Michigan. (See ECF No. 127, PageID.2586-89). Defendants \ncontend that providing notification to such registrants would be impractical due to \naddress staleness concerns, that the notice would be โof limited benefitโ to such class \nmembers, and that mailing a notice to stale addresses could potentially expose the \nDefendants to liability by revealing confidential information to a third party. (Id.) Plaintiffs \ndispute these points and argue that all class-member registrants, regardless of their \ncurrent residence are entitled to notice. The court largely concurs in Plaintiffโs \nassessment.  \n  The present class action was certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(1)(A) & 23(b)(2), (see ECF No. 46.), so the need for and scope of notice is a \nlargely discretionary determination left to the court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A) (โFor any \nclass certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appropriate notice to \nthe class.โ) (emphasis added). See also Lewis v. City of Chicago, Illinois, 702 F.3d 958, \n962 (7th Cir. 2012) (noting that โRule 23 [does not] require notice when a class action is \nresolved on the meritsโ). The court has already entered a stipulated judgment \nrequiringโbased on the courtโs discretionary authority under Rule 23(c)(2)(A)โthat \nDefendants provide notice โto all registrants.โ (ECF No. 126, PageID.2572.) The court \nfinds that the language of the final judgment already requires the notification of all \nregistrants, but the court notes Defendantโs objections to lack merit on their own terms. \nThe fact that some unknown, material percentage of registrants now residing out-of-\nstate will not receive the notification does not logically lead to the conclusion that other \nout-of-state registrants should be deprived of notification. And, if Defendants think the \nPostal Serviceโs change-of-address records will be inadequate, Defendants are free to \nvoluntarily mitigate this concern by using additional commercial address locations \nservices to increase the accuracy of its mailing. See, e.g., Del Carmen v. R.A. Rogers, \nInc., No. SA16CA971FBHJB, 2018 WL 6430835, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2018) \n(noting the use of โLexisNexis Accurint locate serviceโ to find class members).  \nFurthermore, the liability concerns raised by Defendants appear to be illusory as \nthey are not based in any case law or regulation. For any disclosure of confidential \ninformation to occur a third-party would need to first violate federal lawโby opening \nsomeone elseโs mail. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1702. In analogous class actions, where a \nnotification also contains highly private information, notices are still routinely mailed \nthroughout the country. See, e.g., In re Silicone Gel Breast Implant Prod. Liab. Litig., \nNo. CV 92โPโ10000โS, 1994 WL 114580, at *8 (N.D. Ala. Apr. 1, 1994) (directing \nnotification by mail to all individuals known to have received a defective breast implant).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 130, PageID.2650   Filed 10/22/21   Page 3 of 8\n2.

The State Defendants shall send Exhibit 1 (Registrant Notice) in English \nand Spanish to Registrants who are not presently incarcerated via the \nUnited States Postal Service (USPS) by first-class mail to the Registrantsโ \nlast provided address. In addition, the State Defendants shall verify \nRegistrantsโ last provided address against the permanent change-of-\naddress records in the National Change of Address (NCOA) database, and \nsend the Registrant Notice to the updated address on file with the USPS. \nThe State Defendants shall further request that the USPS provide a list \nidentifying the Registrants with active change-of-address requests in the \nNCOA database and their updated address where the Registrant Notice \nwas mailed, and produce any such list to Plaintiffsโ counsel. Any such list \nwill be provided in a searchable, manipulable format, such as an Excel \nspreadsheet, if available in that format. \nb.  For any Registrant Notice returned as undeliverable, but with a new \nforwarding address provided by USPS, the State Defendants will re-mail the \nnotice to the new forwarding address provided. Such re-mailing shall be \ncompleted within 120 days of the date of this order for any mail returned \nwithin 90 days of this orderโs issuance. Notices returned more than 90 days \nafter this orderโs issuance are not required to be remailed.

But as the court noted above, processing of mailed \nnotifications returned as undeliverable is a common practice in class actions. And the \ncourt notes that there are various service and equipment providers that can help \npartially automate the processing of undeliverable mail. Tracking the success of a mass \nmailing is a reasonable part of conducting such a class notification.  \n8 \n ",

See R. 135, Order of Reference \n(Jan. 12, 2022).  \n2. Judge Grand set the conference for Tuesday, April 12, 2022, at 10:00 a.m.,\nwith documents to be supplied to the Court by Friday, April 8, at 4:30 p.m. See R. \n137, Notice to Appear (Feb. 25, 2022). \n1 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 139, PageID.2747   Filed 04/08/22   Page 2 of 2\n3.

Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016) (โDoes Iโ), cert. denied, 138 S. \nCt. 55 (2017), that the current Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), \nM.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq is punishment and that the ex post facto \napplication of the 2006 and 2011 amendments is unconstitutional; and \nWHEREAS, this Court is bound by that decision; and  \nWHEREAS, this Court has certified this case as a class action; and \nWHEREAS, the plaintiffs have filed a motion for partial \nsummary judgment seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief on \ntheir ex post facto claim; and  \nWHEREAS, the plaintiffsโ second amended class action \ncomplaint alleges that the 2011 SORA amendments are not severable, \nand alleges that therefore the statute is null and void as applied to \npre-2011 registrants; and \nWHEREAS, the defendants disagree but the parties wish to \navoid litigating this issue if possible because the issue will likely \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 55, PageID.783   Filed 05/23/19   Page 3 of 5\nbecome moot if the Michigan Legislature passes a new sex offender \nregistration law; and \nWHEREAS, the plaintiffsโ second amended complaint also seeks \nclass-wide relief on other aspects of SORA that this Court previously \nfound to be unconstitutional, which would also likely become moot if \nthe Michigan Legislature passes a new law that addresses this Courtโs \nfinding of constitutional infirmity; and \nWHEREAS, the parties believe that the Michigan Legislature \nshould be given a further opportunity to revise the statute before this \nCourt addresses the Plaintiffsโ request for injunctive relief on the ex \npost facto claim, or the parties litigate the other claims; and \nWHEREAS, ninety days is a reasonable period for legislative \naction, given that the Does I decision has been final since October \n2017;  \nBy stipulation of the parties, it is ORDERED as follows:  \n \n1. The Court enters a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n2201 and 2202 and consistent with Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 \n(6th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 55 (2017), that the current \nSex Offender Registration Act (SORA), M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq. is \npunishment and that the ex post facto application of the 2006 and \n2011 amendments is unconstitutional;  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 55, PageID.784   Filed 05/23/19   Page 4 of 5\n2. The Court defers for 90 days the question of whether this declaratory \njudgment should apply to the following class members: \n \na.  Paul J. Betts and David Allen Snyder, whose criminal appeals are \ncurrently pending before the Michigan Supreme Court; \n \nb.  Members of the pre-2011 subclasses who have a pending direct \nappeal in a criminal case where a Michigan state court, prior to \nAugust 25, 2016, issued a decision involving the question of \nwhether SORA violates the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the U.S. or \nMichigan Constitutions; and  \n \nc.  Members of the pre-2011 subclasses who have an open civil case \nin either Michigan state court or federal court that includes a \nclaim that SORA violates the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the \nMichigan or U.S. Constitutions. \n \n3. In order to avoid interfering with the Michigan legislatureโs efforts  \nto address the Does I decisions and their findings of constitutional \ndeficiencies with SORA, the Court defers a ruling on any injunctive \nrelief for 90 days. The Court also specifically defers ruling on: \n \na. Whether the 2011 amendments can be severed from SORA, and \nwhether, if the 2011 amendments cannot be severed, the statute is \nnull and void as applied to people who are subject to registration \nbased on offenses committed before April 12, 2011; and \n \nb. Whether there are issues in this case that should be certified to \nthe Michigan Supreme Court for decision in the first instance.   \n \n4. In the event that the legislature has not revised the statute within \n90 days of this order, the parties shall submit a joint status report \nand the Court will set a briefing schedule to decide the questions of \n(a) whether this declaratory judgment and any subsequent injunctive \nrelief shall apply to the class members listed in ยถ 2; (b) severability, \nand whether SORA can apply at all to pre-2011 registrants; (c) what \nremedies shall be ordered in this case; and (d) any other issues raised \nby the parties at that time.

Both motions have been fully briefed, and the court held oral \nargument on February 5, 2020. For the reasons explained below, the court will grant \nboth motions and will enter permanent injunctive relief enjoining Defendants and their \nagents from enforcing certain provisions of SORA against the primary class and \nenjoining Defendants and their agents from enforcing the entirety of SORA against \nregistrants whose offenses occurred prior to the enactment of the 2011 amendments to \nSORA (i.e. members of the ex post facto subclasses). \n \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1778   Filed 02/14/20   Page 2 of 32\nII. BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural History \ni. Does I  \n \n  Although this case was filed in 2016, the constitutional challenges to SORA \nbrought in the instant action were first pursued by five John Doe plaintiffs four years \nearlier. Does v. Snyder, No. 12-11194 (E.D. Mich. 2012) (โDoes Iโ). In the Does I case, \nthe court summarized the legislative history of SORA and issued a series of opinions \nresolving the partiesโ various dispositive motions. The courtโs pertinent rulings in the \nDoes I case are summarized below:  \n  (1) SORA is a regulatory statute, not criminal statute, and the retroactive \napplication of the 2011 amendments to SORA does not violate the ex post facto clause. \nDoes I, No. 12-11194 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 18, 2013) (ECF No. 27, PageID.683); \n   \n(2) SORAโs retroactive application of lifetime reporting requirements does not \nviolate the due process clause. Does I, No. 12-11194 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2015) (ECF \nNo. 103, PageID.5939); \n \n(3) the following sections of SORA are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the \ndue process clause, Does I, No. 12-11194 (ECF No. 103, PageID.5890โ5900): \n \n(a) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(b) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยงยง 28.733โ 734;  \n \n(c) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735;  \n \n(d) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely used \nby the individual,โ Mich. Comp.

Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(j); \n \n  (4) SORA violates the due process clause by imposing strict liability for \nviolations, and the statute must be read as imputing a knowledge requirement. Does I, \nNo. 12-11194 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2015) (ECF No. 103, PageID.5907โ09);  \n \n  (5) the following sections of SORA violate the First Amendment, Does I, No. 12-\n11194 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2015) (ECF No. 103, PageID.5927โ29; ECF No. 118, \nPageID.6029): \n \n(a) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering authority \n. . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes any electronic \nmail or instant message address, or any other designations used in \ninternet communications or postings,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.725(1)(f);  \n \n(b) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely used \nby the individual,โ Mich. Comp.

The Sixth Circuitโs decision focused on only Plaintiffsโ ex \npost facto claim. The Circuit held that SORA imposes punishment and that the \nretroactive application of SORAโs 2006 and 2011 amendments is unconstitutional. Id. at \n706. This decision effectively vacated the above-listed first and second rulings of this \ncourt but arguably relegated to dicta the remainder of this courtโs rulings.

(ECF No. 46.) The certified class is comprised \n5 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1782   Filed 02/14/20   Page 6 of 32\nof a primary class and two subclasses. Plaintiffs define the primary class as all people \nwho are or will be subject to registration under SORA. The primary class seeks relief on \nCount I (vagueness); Count II (strict liability) and Count III (First Amendment). (EFC No. \n46, PageID.693.) The subclasses seek relief on Count IV (ex post facto) and are \ndefined as follows: \n(1) The โpre-2006 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before January 1, 2006, and who have committed no \nregistrable offense since.  \n \n(2) The โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration on or after January 1, 2006, but before April 12, 2011, and \nwho have committed no registrable offense since. \n(Id.) \n  In July 2018, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the ex post facto \nclaim on behalf of the subclasses. Plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nbut deferred for later briefing the question of whether SORAโs amendments are \nseverable. (ECF No. 40.) While this motion was pending, the parties agreed to focus \ntheir resources on legislative reform, rather than litigating severability. At the joint \nrequest of the parties, the court repeatedly adjusted the briefing schedule to aid in the \npartiesโ attempts to engage in legislative negotiations. (ECF Nos. 41, 44, 45, 47, 51, \n54.) \n  In May 2019, the court entered a stipulated order granting declaratory relief for \nPlaintiffs, holding that the 2006 and 2011 amendments were unconstitutional as applied \nto the ex post facto subclasses. (ECF No. 55.) The court deferred ruling on the issues of \ninjunctive relief and the severability of the 2006 and 2011 amendments for 90 days โ[i]n \n6 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1783   Filed 02/14/20   Page 7 of 32\norder to avoid interfering with the Michigan legislatureโs efforts to address the Does I \ndecisions and their findings of constitutional deficiencies with SORA.โ (ECF No. 55, \nPageID.783.) Information presented by Plaintiffsโ counsel at oral argument indicates that \nwhile the briefing schedule was stayed, the parties engaged in several apparently \nsubstantial discussions with โstakeholdersโ and legislative staff, which resulted in draft \nlegislation. Counsel reported that the parties were hopeful that discussions would \ncontinue and culminate in the passage of new legislation, but for reasons unknown to \nthe court, those discussions ended with no replacement legislation in place. \nConsequently, Plaintiffs exercised their option of seeking relief in returning to court, and \nthe court issued a revised briefing schedule. (ECF No. 60.)  \nIn September 2019, Plaintiffs filed a refreshed motion for partial summary \njudgment addressing the severability of the amendments to SORA and injunctive relief \nfor their ex post fact claim. (ECF No. 62.) Several months passed, and Plaintiffs filed a \nmotion for partial summary judgment on behalf of the primary class related to their \nremaining constitutional claims (vagueness, First Amendment, strict liability). Both \nmotions have now been fully briefed, were argued before this court, and will be \naddressed in this opinion.  \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1784   Filed 02/14/20   Page 8 of 32\nB. Related Michigan Supreme Court Case \nDefendantsโ briefs point to and rely upon an appeal in a criminal case now before \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 (Mich.).2 Betts involves a \ncriminal defendant who challenges his conviction for failing to register under SORA. \nDefendant/Appellant Betts was convicted in 1994 for the crime subjecting him to SORA \nregistration.3 The Michigan Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and issued a \nbriefing order directing the parties to address the following issues: \n(1) whether the requirements of the Sex Offenders Registration Act \n(SORA), MCL 28.721 et seq., taken as a whole, amount to โpunishmentโ \nfor purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Michigan and United \nStates Constitutions;  \n \n(2) if SORA, as a whole, constitutes punishment, whether it became \npunitive only upon the enactment of a certain provision or group of \nprovisions added after the initial version of SORA was enacted;  \n \n(3) if SORA only became punitive after a particular enactment, whether a \nresulting ex post facto violation would be remedied by applying the version \nof SORA in effect before it transformed into a punishment or whether a \ndifferent remedy applies;  \n \n(4) if one or more discrete provisions of SORA, or groups of provisions, \nare found to be ex post facto punishments, whether the remaining \n \n2 Although Plaintiffsโ initial brief also mentioned a possible, related case pending \nbefore the Sixth Circuit, Lewis v. Whitmer, No. 18-1912 (6th Cir.) (ECF No. 62, \nPageID.816), Plaintiffs did not discuss it during oral argument. The Lewis case carries \nno precedential weight in the instant matter because the Sixth Circuitโs docket shows \nthat the case was recently remanded to district court at the joint request of the parties. \nSee Lewis v. Whitmer, No. 18-1912, Joint Mot. for Limited Remand (6th Cir. Jan. 27, \n2020) (ECF No. 35); Order for Joint Mot. to Remand (6th Cir. Jan. 28, 2020) (ECF No. \n36.) \n3 The court obtained the date of the defendantโs offense from the publicly \navailable registration database. Michigan Public Sex Offender Registry, Mich. State \nPolice,http://www.icrimewatch.net/offenderdetails.php?OfndrID=1996102&AgencyID=55\n242,  (last visited Jan. 24, 2020). \n8 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1785   Filed 02/14/20   Page 9 of 32\nprovisions can be given effect retroactively without applying the ex post \nfacto provisions;  \n \n(5) what consequences would arise if the remaining provisions could not \nbe given retroactive effect; and  \n \n(6) whether the answers to these questions require the reversal of the \ndefendantโs conviction pursuant to MCL 28.729 for failure to register under \nSORA. \n \n(ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979โ80.)  \n \nIII. STANDARD \n \n  Plaintiffs move for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the ex post facto \nsubclasses on their ex post facto claim and move for partial summary judgment on \nbehalf of the primary class on their remaining constitutional claims. \nSummary judgment is appropriate when there exists no dispute of material fact \nand the moving party demonstrates entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court considers all \nevidence, and all reasonable inferences flowing therefrom, in the light most favorable to \nthe nonmoving party. Moran v. Al Basit LLC, 788 F.3d 201, 204 (6th Cir. 2015). The \ncourt may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence presented in \nsupport or opposition to a motion for summary judgment; only the finder of fact can \nmake such determinations. Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d 714, 726 (6th Cir. \n2014). \nThe movant has the initial burden of showingโpointing outโthe absence of a \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact; i.e., โan absence of evidence to support the \nnonmoving partyโs case.โ See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 325 (1986). \n9 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1786   Filed 02/14/20   Page 10 of 32\nThe burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth enough admissible evidence \nto raise a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Laster, 746 F.3d at 726 (citing Celotex \nCorp., 477 U.S. at 324). A genuine issue exists โif the evidence is such that a \nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. \nat 248; Williams v. AT&T Mobility Servs. LLC, 847 F.3d 384, 391 (6th Cir. 2017). Not all \nfactual disputes are material. A fact is โmaterialโ for purposes of summary judgment \nwhen proof of that fact would establish or refute an essential element of the claim โand \nwould affect the application of the governing law to the rights of the parties.โ Rachells v. \nCingular Wireless Employee Servs., LLC, 732 F.3d 652, 660 (6th Cir. 2013).  \nIV. DISCUSSION \n \nThe court begins by addressing the claim pursued by the ex post facto \nsubclasses and then turns to the remaining claims brought on behalf of the primary \nclass. Finally, the court will address the issue of Defendantsโ obligation to provide notice \nof this decision to class members, law enforcement, and prosecutors.  \nA. Ex Post Facto Claim (Count IV) \n \n  Plaintiffs argue that the Sixth Circuit broadly held in Does I that the 2006 and \n2011 amendments to SORA violate the ex post facto clause and cannot be applied, in \nwhole, to members of the ex post facto subclasses. Plaintiffs ask this court to find that \nthe 2006 and 2011 amendments to SORA are not severable and to permanently enjoin \nDefendants from enforcing SORA against members of the ex post facto subclasses. \nDefendants do not dispute that members of the ex post facto subclasses are entitled to \ninjunctive relief but argue that this court should certify the issue of the severability, \n10 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1787   Filed 02/14/20   Page 11 of 32\npassing it to the Michigan Supreme Court for final determination. Defendants contend \nthat certification is necessary to avoid the possibility of inconsistent judgments because \nthe Michigan Supreme Court will soon address in the Betts case โthe very questions \nposed by the Plaintiffs in their motion.โ (ECF No. 66, PageID.951.) In the alternative, \nDefendants argue that the 2011 amendments are severable from SORA because in \nDoes I, the Sixth Circuit declared unconstitutional only portions of the amendments.  \n1. Scope of Does I Decision \n  The court begins by clarifying the scope of the Sixth Circuitโs holding in Does I. \nDefendants argue that the Sixth Circuit declared unconstitutional only certain portions of \nthe amendments of SORA, specifically those portions of the amendments which sweep \nmore broadly than SORAโs federal analog, the Sex Offender Registration and \nNotification Act (โSORNAโ). Defendantsโ position, implying as it does that the Sixth \nCircuit tailored its ruling to coincide with SORNA, relies heavily on the supposed intent \nof the Michigan legislature to bring SORA into compliance with SORNA in passing the \n2011 amendments. A large problem with Defendantsโ argument, however, is that the \nSixth Circuit does not so much as mention SORNA in its opinion.  \nThe Sixth Circuitโs expansive ruling in Does I declared that โ[t]he retroactive \napplication of SORAโs 2006 and 2011 amendments to Plaintiffs is unconstitutional, and \n11 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1788   Filed 02/14/20   Page 12 of 32\nit must therefore cease.โ Does I, 834 F.3d at 706.4 Defendants contend that the Sixth \nCircuitโs finding of unconstitutionality should be limited to SORAโs exclusion zones, in-\nperson reporting requirements, and maintenance of a public registration website \nbecause these provisions of SORA extend beyond the requirements of SORNA. (ECF \nNo. 66, PageID.965โ67.) But the court is confident that the Sixth Circuit would have at \nleast mentioned SORNA and referenced specific provisions of the act if it had meant to \nlimit its holding in the manner described by Defendants. Instead, it addressed the \naggregate impact of the 2006 and 2011 amendments, making no distinction between \nparticular provisions. In fact, the court specifically declined to address the plaintiffsโ \nremaining constitutional challenges to SORA because โnone of the contested provisions \nmay now be applied to the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, and anything [the court] would say on \nthose other matters would be dicta.โ Does I, 834 F.3d, at 706. \n On remand, this court entered judgment consistent with Sixth Circuitโs ruling, \ndeclaring that the โretroactive application of the Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration \nActโs (SORA) 2006 and 2011 amendments violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the \nU.S. Constitution.โ Does I, No. 12-11194 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 26, 2018) (ECF No. 153, \nPageID.6514.) This court cannot now impose additional limits to the Sixth Circuitโs \ndecision and must read Does I as broadlyโand quite clearlyโinvalidating all portions of \n \n4 To the extent that this courtโs opinion in Cain v. Michigan, et al., No. 19-cv-\n10243 (E.D. Mich. June 5, 2019) suggests the opposite result, the court now clarifies its \nposition that the Sixth Circuitโs holding relates to the entirety of the 2006 and 2011 \namendments. In Cain, the courtโs primary rational for denying the plaintiffโs request for \npreliminary injunction was that the plaintiff, as a member of the mandatory Does II class, \ncould not obtain individual injunctive relief while the class litigated its constitutional \nclaims.   \n12 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1789   Filed 02/14/20   Page 13 of 32\nthe 2006 and 2011 amendments as applied to the members of the ex post facto \nsubclasses. With this point of clarification in mind, the court turns to the issues of \ncertification and the severability of SORAโs amendments.   \n2. Certification to Michigan Supreme Court \nThe briefing on the issue of severability focuses on the 2011 amendments5 to \nSORA, which comprise roughly half of the statute. (ECF No. 62-2, PageID.841โ62.) The \nparties dispute whether the 2011 amendments are severable, meaning whether the \namendments are so intertwined with the statute that removing them renders \nincomprehensible the entirety of SORA. Plaintiffs argue that the 2011 amendments are \nnot severable and that SORA must be declared null and void as applied to members of \nthe ex post facto subclasses. Defendants respond that the Michigan Supreme Court, \nnot this court, should determine the issue of the severability and urge this court to certify \nthe question. Defendants suggest that certification is appropriate because the Michigan \nSupreme Court will soon rule on SORAโs severability in People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 \n(Mich.). In the alternative, Defendants argue that the amendments are severable.  \nEastern District of Michigan Local Rule 83.40 provides the standard for certifying \nan issue to a state court: \n(a) Upon motion or after a hearing ordered by the Judge sua sponte, the \nJudge may certify an issue for decision to the highest Court of the State \n \n5 At the hearing, the parties agreed that the 2006 amendments were severable. \nThe courtโs analysisโ like the partiesโ briefsโwill focus on the severability of the 2011 \namendments because if the 2011 amendments cannot be severed, SORA cannot apply \nto any members of the ex post facto subclasses, including registrants whose crimes \nsubjecting them to registration were committed before the enactment of the 2006 \namendments. See infra Part IV.A.3. \n \n13 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1790   Filed 02/14/20   Page 14 of 32\nwhose law governs its disposition. An order of certification shall be \naccompanied by written findings that: \n \n(1) the issue certified is an unsettled issue of State law, and \n \n(2) the issue certified will likely control the outcome of the federal \nsuit, and \n \n(3) certification of the issue will not cause undue delay or prejudice.  \n \nSuch order shall also include citation to precedent, statutory or court rule \nauthority authorizing the State Court involved to resolve certified \nquestions. \n \n(b) In all such cases, the order of certification shall stay federal \nproceedings for a fixed time which shall be subsequently enlarged only \nupon a showing that such additional time is required to obtain a State \nCourt decision and is not the result of dilatory actions on the part of the \nlitigants. \n \n(c) In cases certified to the Michigan Supreme Court, in addition to the \nfindings required by this Rule, the United States District Court shall \napprove an agreed statement of facts which shall be subsequently \ntransmitted to the Michigan Supreme Court by the parties as an appendix \nto briefs filed therein. \n \nE.D. Mich. L.R. 83.40.  \nโWhether to utilize a state courtโs certification procedure is a matter within \nthe discretion of the court and is โmost appropriate when the question is new and \nstate law is unsettled.โโ State Auto Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hargis, 785 F.3d 189, \n194 (6th Cir. 2015). Additionally, โthe appropriate time for a party to seek \ncertification of a state-law issue is before, not after, the district court has resolved \nthe issue.โ Id. Upon review of the partiesโ briefs and arguments, the court cannot \nmake the necessary findings required by Rule 83.40 to certify the issue of \nseverability to the Michigan Supreme Court.  \n14 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1791   Filed 02/14/20   Page 15 of 32\n  First, the question of severability is not โan unsettled issue of state law.โ E.D. \nMich. LR 83.40(a)(1). Although โ[s]tate law governs the question of severability,โ \nMemphis Planned Parenthood, Inc. v. Sundquist, 175 F.3d 456, 466 (6th Cir. 1999), the \nstate of Michigan has clearly defined law on severability. See infra Part IV.A.3. \nMichiganโs existing severability law presents this court with โa reasonably clear and \nprincipled course . . . to follow.โ Pennington v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 553 F.3d \n447, 450 (6th Cir. 2009). And as Plaintiffs correctly observe, โ[w]hile Michigan courts \nhave not precisely addressed severability of the 2011 SORA amendments, โ[t]he state \ncourt need not have addressed the exact question, so long as well-established \nprinciples exist to govern a decision.โ State Auto Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hargis, 785 \nF.3d 189, 194 (6th Cir. 2015).โ (ECF No. 62, PageID. 827โ28.)  \nTo the extent Defendants argue that the severability of SORAโs 2011 \namendments is a novel question of state law because the Michigan Supreme Court \ngranted leave to appeal in Betts, such argument misses the mark because the issues in \nBetts are not identical to the remaining questions of law in this case. Before the Betts \ncourt can reach the topic of severability, it must first address threshold issues of state \nconstitutional law which the Sixth Circuit has already answered at the federal level, \nnamely whether SORA amounts to punishment and can be applied retroactively. Does I, \n834 F.3d at 705โ06. The Michigan Supreme Court is not bound by the Sixth Circuitโs \nrulings in Does I and may come to different conclusions based on Michiganโs \nconstitution. For example, as Plaintiffs observe, the Michigan Supreme Court may reach \na narrower decision than the Sixth Circuit and decide that SORA became punishment \n15 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1792   Filed 02/14/20   Page 16 of 32\nafter the 1997 amendments. In that case, the court would then address whether the \n1997 amendments are severable. The โnovelโ question of state law at issue in Bettsโ\nwhether SORA amounts to punishmentโis no longer a relevant question to this court at \nthis stage in the case. Should the Michigan Supreme Court reach the issue of \nseverability in Betts, the court will simply apply Michiganโs clearly established \nseverability law. This court need not wait for that possibility to occur. This court is \ncapable of applying established Michigan severability law in this case.6 \n  Second, certification will not โcontrol the outcomeโ of this case because the \nseverability of the 2011 amendments is but one facet of one of Plaintiffsโ four separate \nclaims. Even though Defendants do not present any new arguments on Plaintiffsโ non \nex post facto claims, a determination by the Michigan Supreme Court on severability will \nnot resolve the lingering questions of injunctive relief in this case. \n  Third, certification will cause additional, and undue, delay and prejudice to \nPlaintiffs. Three and a half years have passed since the Does I ruling. Certification \nwould further draw out these proceedings for an indeterminate period of time while: (1) \nthe parties prepare the statement required by E.D. Mich. LR 83.40(c), (2) the parties \n \n6 Should the Betts court reach the issue of the of severability of the 2011 \namendments and that ruling runs somehow contrary to this courtโs determination, this \ncourt can modify its judgment to conform with Betts. See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 60(b). When \nthe court raised with Defendants at the hearing the feasibility of amending the judgment \nin this case to conform with a possible, adverse judgment from the Bettsโ court, \nDefendants asserted that amending the judgment would require the expenditure of \nadditional judicial resources. Near the eight-year mark in this combined litigation, the \ncourt is not much daunted by the prospect of expending additional judicial resources . . . \nas the court put it at argument, that horse has left the barn. In sum, Defendants offered \nno legal justification for why amendment under Rule 60 would not be appropriate.   \n16 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1793   Filed 02/14/20   Page 17 of 32\nbrief and argue the issue of certification for the Michigan Supreme Court, (3) the \nMichigan Supreme Court decides whether to accept the certified question, Mich.

R. \n7.308(A)(2), (4) the Michigan Supreme Court issues a merits opinion, and (5) the parties \nreturn to this court and relitigate any remaining issues, particularly injunctive relief. \nGiven the clarity of Michigan law on severability, the age of this case, and the ongoing \nviolation of Plaintiffsโ rights, the additional delay inevitably brought on by the certification \nprocess is unwarranted and inappropriate. See Valls v. Allstate Ins. Co., 919 F.3d 739, \n744 (2d Cir. 2019) (declining certification partly due to the โinevitable burdens on the \nparties relating to the cost and delayโ); Florida ex rel. Shevin v. Exxon Corp., 526 F.2d \n266, 275 (5th Cir. 1976) (explaining that in the context of certification, โdelay that is not \nabsolutely necessary should be avoided,โ especially when a case is already several \nyears old); Montgomery v. Gore Mutual Insurance Co., 2019 WL 5303749 (E.D. Mich. \n2019) (Drain, J.) (denying certification, in part, to avoid further delay in the two-year-old \ncase). The court will decline to certify the question of the severability of SORAโs 2011 \namendments and will turn to the merits of the partiesโ severability arguments. \n3. Severability of the 2011 Amendments \n \n  Michigan law governs the question of severability. Memphis Planned \nParenthood, Inc., 175 F.3d at 466. โThe general rule favors severability.โ Blank v. Depโt \nof Corr., 122, 611 N.W.2d 530, 539 (Mich. 2000). For a statute to be severable, โthe \nvalid portion of the statute must be independent of the invalid sections, forming a \ncomplete act within itself.โ Pletz v. Secโy of State, 336 N.W.2d 789, 808 (Mich. Ct. App. \n1983). In determining the severability of a statute, the court should first consider \n17 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1794   Filed 02/14/20   Page 18 of 32\nwhether โthe Legislature expressed that the provisions at issue were not to be severed \nfrom the remainder of the act.โ Blank v. Depโt of Corr., 122, 611 N.W.2d at 540. If not, \nthe court must then determine whether the โunconstitutional portions are so entangled \nwith the others that they cannot be removed without adversely affecting the operation of \nthe act.โ Blank, 611 N.W.2d at 540.  \n  The statutory text of SORA contains no severability clause.7 However, the \nMichigan Legislature has adopted a general severability clause applicable to all \nstatutes: \nIn the construction of the statutes of this state the following rules shall be \nobserved unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest \nintent of the legislature, that is to say: If any portion of an act or the \napplication thereof to any person or circumstances shall be found to be \ninvalid by a court, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or \napplications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid portion \nor application . . . , and to this end acts are declared to be severable.  \n \nMich. Comp. Laws ยง 8.5. Under this framework, the court concludes that the 2011 \namendments to SORA are not severable. \n  The highlighted version of SORA attached as an exhibit to Plaintiffsโ motion  \nshows that the 2011 amendments permeate nearly every section of the statute, most \nproblematically the definition section of the act related to the tier classification system. \n(ECF No. 62-2, PageID.841โ862.) It is fair to say that the 2011 amendments almost \nentirely rewrote the statute. Removing the deeply ingrained 2011 amendments renders \n \n7 Although Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.728(8) provides that if the public availability \nof SORA information is declared unconstitutional, the website must be revised \naccordingly, such instructions do not amount to a severability clause for the statute as a \nwhole.  \n \n18 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1795   Filed 02/14/20   Page 19 of 32\nthe statute, as Plaintiffsโ aptly describe, a โnonsensical alphabet soupโ of sentence \nfragments.8 (ECF No. 62, PageID.821.) The 2011 amendments โare not like a collection \n \n8 Encountering the resulting fragmented product induces in the reader a reaction \nof โWait . . . what?โ Take as one of many examples ยง 28.725 of SORA. That section is \nmeant to describe โConditions requiring individual to report in person and provide notice \nto registering authority; release of incarcerated individual; notice; compliance.โ With the \n2011 amendments excised it would read as follows: \n \n(1) An individual required to be registered under this act shall and notify \nthe having jurisdiction where his or her residence or domicile is located \nafter: \n(a) individual changes or vacates his or her residence domicile \n \n(5) after either of the following occurs, the department of corrections shall \nnotify the local law enforcement agency or sheriff's department having \njurisdiction over the area to which the individual is transferred or the \ndepartment post of the transferred residence or domicile of an individual \nrequired to be registered under this act: \n(a) The individual is transferred to a community residential \nprogram.  \n(b) The individual is transferred into a correctional facility of any \nkind, including a correctional camp or work camp. \n \n(6) An individual required to be registered under this act shall and notify \nthe before he or she changes his or her domicile or residence to another \nstate. The individual shall indicate the new state and, if known, the new \naddress. The department shall update the registration and compilation \ndatabases and promptly notify the appropriate law enforcement agency \nand any applicable sex or child offender registration authority in the new \nstate \n \n(8) If the probation or parole of an individual required to be registered \nunder this act is transferred to another state or an individual required to \nbe registered under this act is transferred from a state correctional facility \nto any correctional facility or probation or parole in another state, the \ndepartment of corrections shall promptly notify the department and the \nappropriate law enforcement agency and any applicable sex or child \noffender registration authority in the new state. The department shall \nupdate the registration and compilation databases.  \n \n(9) An individual registered under this act shall comply with the \n19 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1796   Filed 02/14/20   Page 20 of 32\nof bricks, some of which may be taken away without disturbing the [provisions that \nexisted before], but rather are like the interwoven threads constituting the warp and \nwoof of a fabric, one set of which cannot be removed without fatal consequences to the \nwhole.โ Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 315 (1936) (striking down the \nBituminous Coal Conservation Act). Without the 2011 amendments, SORA registrants \nand law enforcement officials have no guidance for who must register, what events \nmust be reported, where registrants must report, how often registrants must report, or \nwhen registrants become eligible for removal from the registry. Michigan law makes \nclear that SORA cannot be enforced given such glaring omissions. See In re \nApportionment of State Legislature-1982, 321 N.W.2d 565, 582 (Mich. 1982) (holding \nthat in light of the illegality of Michiganโs weighted land area-population apportionment \nformula, all apportionment rules must be struck down because the rules were \nโinextricably relatedโ to the formula). \nCourts must avoid an approach to severability that โwould require a significant \nrewrite of the statutory language.โ People v. Lockridge, 870 N.W.2d 502, 520 (Mich. \n2015). Without the key definitions and provisions provided by the 2011 amendments, \nSORA in its current form is incomprehensible to registrants and enforcement officials \nalike. While the court may excavate and remove unconstitutional pieces of a statute, it \n \nverification procedures and proof of residence procedures prescribed in \nsections 4a and 5a. \n \n(10) Except as provided in shall comply with this section for.  \n \n(11) Except as provided in shall comply with this section for. \n \n20 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1797   Filed 02/14/20   Page 21 of 32\nmust hesitate gravely before trying to backfill the holes left behind with newly-crafted \nstatutory language. The burden of that manual labor falls, in almost every instance, to \nthe legislature. As the Constitution empowers the court to exercise โneither force nor will \nbut merely judgmentโ, The Federalist No. 78 (A. Hamilton) (capitalization altered), it \nremains โthe province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.โ \nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 178 (1803). โThere can be no liberty . . . if the power of \njudging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.โ The Federalist No. \n47 (J. Madison). \nAccordingly, because the 2011 amendments cannot be severed from the statute, \nthe court holds that SORA in toto cannot be applied to any members of the ex post facto \nsubclasses.9 \n4. Revival of Earlier Version of SORA  \nPlaintiffs argue that the court cannot revive an earlier version of SORA because \nany revived statute would be void for vagueness and contradict the intent of the \nlegislature. (ECF No. 62, PageID.822โ27.) Defendants respond, in a footnote, that \nMichigan law favors reviving previous versions of a statute when the existing statute has \nbeen declared unconstitutional. (ECF No. 66, PageID.972.) \n \n9 In light of this ruling, the severability of the 2006 amendments is now moot, \nalthough the court notes that the parties agreed at the hearing that the 2006 \namendments are severable. The courtโs determination that the 2011 amendments are \nnot severable means that the entirety of SORA cannot apply to any persons whose \ncrime subjecting them to registration occurred before the enactment of the 2011 \namendments.  \n \n \n21 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1798   Filed 02/14/20   Page 22 of 32\nThere exists some precedent to suggest that Michigan allows for earlier versions \nof a statute to be revived when the current version of a statute is declared \nunconstitutional. See Mcclellan v. Judge Of Recorderโs Court Of Detroit, 201 N.W. 209, \n212 (Mich. 1924) (โWe are therefore constrained to hold the law invalid, which leaves all \npreceding laws upon that subject in force.โ); Glancy v. City of Roseville, 577 N.W.2d \n897, 903 (Mich. 1998) (Kelly, J. dissenting). At the same time, in the context of \nlegislative revival, Michigan has adopted an explicit, anti-revival approach. See Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 8.4 (โWhenever a statute, or any part thereof shall be repealed by a \nsubsequent statute, such statute, or any part thereof, so repealed, shall not be revived \nby the repeal of such subsequent repealing statute.โ). This apparent contradiction \nbetween Michigan case law and statutory authority, along with the practical \nconsiderations described below, compels the court to conclude that revival of an earlier \nversion of SORA is not appropriate.  \nThe current version of SORA contains no revival clause, and the statute has \nbeen extensively modified since its passage in 1994. See 1996 Mich. Pub. Acts 494; \n1999 Mich. Pub. Acts 85; 2002 Mich. Pub. Acts 542; 2004 Mich. Pub. Acts 238, 239, \n240; 2005 Mich. Pub. Acts 121, 127, 132; 2006 Mich. Pub. Acts 46; 2011 Mich. Pub. \nActs 17, 18; 2013 Mich. Pub. Acts 149. The dramatic revisions to SORA throughout the \nyears leaves the court at a loss to determine which version of SORA most appropriately \ncaptures the legislativeโs โmanifest intentโ supporting the current version of the statute. \nThe courtโs revival inquiry is further complicated by the fact that SORA, in light of this \nopinion, is unenforceable in whole as to members of the ex post facto subclasses but \n22 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1799   Filed 02/14/20   Page 23 of 32\nremains enforceable, under the terms of this opinion, as to all registrants whose \noffenses requiring them to register occurred after the enactment of the 2011 \namendments.  \nThus, if SORA were to be revived, not only must the court decide which version \nof SORA to revive, but the court must also decide which version of SORA should apply \nto which group of registrants. Making these determinations invites pure speculation on \nthe part of the court and could result in a system in which different versions of SORA \napply to different classes of registrants, which would create an administrative nightmare \nfor law enforcement and registrants alike. For example, if the court were to revive an \nearlier version of SORA, the court must decide which one of the five pre-2006 versions \nof SORA would apply to members of the pre-2006 ex post facto subclass. Additionally, \nthe court would also need to decide which version of SORA should apply to members of \nthe pre-2011 subclass or whether each registrant should be forced to comply with the \nversion of  SORA in effect at the time of his offense. Absent any indication of legislative \nmanifest intent regarding which revival configuration is preferred, the court may as well \nspin the wheel and revive whichever version of SORA on which the marble lands. \nRegistrants, law enforcement, and the public, however, deserve a reasoned resolution. \nPutting aside the guesswork inherent in reviving an earlier version of SORA, the \ncourt concludes that revival is not appropriate for another reason. Revival would force \nregistrants to comply with an earlier version of the statute that is not easily locatable and \npotentially in contradiction to the current, published, version of the law. Thus, to ensure \ntheir compliance with the law, registrants must first locate earlier versions of SORA and \n23 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1800   Filed 02/14/20   Page 24 of 32\nthen reconcile the applicable version with the current lawโthis is an arduous task, even \nfor individuals with legal research experience and access to online legal databases. \nExpecting laypeople to engage in such โlegal archeologyโโas Plaintiffsโ counsel puts \nitโwould violate vagueness principles, specifically the fair notice requirement under \nwhich laws must be โclearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, \nin advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue.โ Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., \n269 U.S. 385, 393 (1926). Law enforcement too would be saddled with the burden of \nlocating and understanding outdated statutes and, depending on the configuration of the \nrevived version of SORA, be required to find each offendersโ offense dateโwhich is \noften buried deep in court documentsโto determine which version of SORA to enforce \nagainst a particular registrant. Such individualized enforcement is not a workable \nsolution.  \nโCourts may not speculate regarding legislative intent beyond the words \nexpressed in a statute. Hence, nothing may be read into a statute that is not within the \nmanifest intent of the Legislature as derived from the act itself.โ Mich. Educ. Assโn v. \nSecโy of State, 801 N.W.2d 35, 48 (Mich. 2011) (quoting Omne Fin, Inc v Shacks, Inc., \n596 NW2d 591 (Mich. 1999)). SORA has undergone numerous substantive changes \nsince its enactment. Neither party suggests, and the court simply cannot imagine, a way \nfor the court to make an informed and logical determination as to which iteration and \nconfiguration of SORA most accurately captures the current manifest intent of the \nMichigan legislature. The court will not engage in the kind of speculation required to \npiece together a revived version of SORA.  \n24 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1801   Filed 02/14/20   Page 25 of 32\nUnless and until decisive action is taken by the Michigan legislature, no \nprovisions of SORA may be enforced against members of the ex post facto subclasses. \nB. Due Process and First Amendment Claims (Counts I, II, and III) \n  Plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on behalf of the primary class on \nCount I (Vagueness), Count II (Strict Liability), and Count III (First Amendment). \nPlaintiffs ask the court to declare certain provisions of SORA unconstitutional, \nconsistent with this courtโs rulings in Does I, and to enjoin Defendants from enforcing \nthe unconstitutional portions of SORA against all registrants. Defendants do not \nsubstantially disagree with this course of action. \n  In their response, Defendants to do not present any new challenges to the courtโs \nrulings in Does I and admit that โnothing has occurred in the intervening time [since \nDoes I] that would compel the [c]ourt to reach a different result from those rulings here.โ \n(ECF 77, PageID.1654.) Defendants republish their arguments initially raised in Does I \nfor purposes of appeal but nevertheless agree with Plaintiffs that the portions of SORA \nwhich this court declared unconstitutional in Does I can be severed and that SORA \nremains enforceable, without the unconstitutional provisions, against all registrants \nwhose offenses subjecting them to registration occurred after the enactment of the 2011 \namendments. (ECF No. 77, PageID.1660, 1667โ1678.) The remainder of Defendantsโ \nbrief restates their earlier argument that the question of severability should be certified \nto the Supreme Court of Michigan. \n  The Does I case involved constitutional challenges to SORA brought by four \nindividual plaintiffs whereas this case involves constitutional challenges pursued by a \n25 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1802   Filed 02/14/20   Page 26 of 32\ncertified class. Because Does I was a separate case with different plaintiffs, this courtโs \nrulings in Does I are not binding determinations in this case. United States v. Moored, \n38 F.3d 1419, 1421 (6th Cir. 1994) (โUnder the doctrine of law of the case, findings \nmade at one point in the litigation become the law of the case for subsequent stages of \nthat same litigation.โ) (emphasis added). Even though Does I is not binding precedent, \nthe parties present no new arguments suggesting that the courtโs analysis in Does I \nshould not be extended to this case. Nor does the court see any reason to deviate from \nits earlier determinations on the same questions of law presented in the instant motion. \nAccordingly, the court reaffirms its rulings in Does I (familiarity with which is presumed) \nand extends its analysis therein to the facts of this case. Consistent with the courtโs \nreasoning and findings in Does I, the following provisions for SORA will be declared \nunconstitutional as to all registrants: \n(a) Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \n(1) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(2) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(3) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735;  \n \n(4) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers  . . .  routinely \nused by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(5) the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \n     (b) Provisions Void for Strict Liability: \n  \n26 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1803   Filed 02/14/20   Page 27 of 32\n(1) under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, SORA \nmust be interpreted as incorporating a knowledge requirement. \n \n(c) Provisions Void under the First Amendment: \n \n(1) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes any \nelectronic mail or instant message address, or any other designations \nused in internet communications or postings,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง \n28.725(1)(f);  \n \n(2) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely \nused by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(3) the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and \ninstant message addresses . . . routinely used by the individual, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(l); \n \n(4) the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registrationโs \nrequirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses assigned to the individual . . . and all login names \nor other identifiers used by the individual when using any electronic \nmail address or instant messaging system,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง \n28.727(1)(i). \n \nThe court will enjoin Defendants from enforcing only the abovementioned \nportions of SORA. The remainder of SORA will still apply to all registrants whose \noffenses subjecting them to registration occurred after the enactment of the 2011 \namendments.  \nC. Notice Requirement \n  Plaintiffs also request that this court order Defendants to provide notice of the \nrelief granted in this order to all SORA registrants, law enforcement officials, and \nprosecuting attorneys. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grant the court broad \ndiscretion to ensure that class members receive proper notice. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(2)(A), (d)(1)(B). This court receives several calls a week from registrants inquiring \n27 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1804   Filed 02/14/20   Page 28 of 32\nabout the status of SORA and of this case, and is therefore aware of the confusion \nwhich presently exists regarding the legal status of SORA. The rulings in this order are \nlikely to add to the existing uncertainty among law enforcement and registrants if notice \nis not provided. Thus, the court will order notice under the terms described below. \n  Plaintiffs assert that the Michigan State Police SOR Unit is best suited to issue \nnotices because it maintains the records for all registrants and has experience with \nproviding notice to registrants and law enforcement. (ECF No. 75, PageID.1150.) The \ncourt is amendable to the proposition of having the Michigan State Police spearhead the \ndissemination of notices but will direct the parties to confer and suggest to the court the \nmost appropriate form of notice and methods for providing notice. The court will direct \nthe parties to begin preparing notices to provide to registrants, law enforcement, and \nprosecuting attorneys. As part of this process, the parties will work to update the MSP \nExplanation of Duties formโwhich is provided to registrants each time they reportโto \naccurately reflect the legal status of SORA in light of this order. The court will decide \nany issues that may arise as the parties craft the required notices, and approve a final \nform.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n  For several years, registrants have been forced to comply with unconstitutional \nprovisions of SORA. The parties, and this court, expected that the Sixth Circuitโs ruling \nwould spur legislative action, and for some time, it appeared that the legislature was \npoised to pass a new and comprehensive statute, obviating the need for this opinion. \nUnfortunately, the legislature was not able to finalize a new registration statute. Faced \n28 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1805   Filed 02/14/20   Page 29 of 32\nwith the continued violation of their rights, Plaintiffs returned to this court to remedy \nDefendantsโ ongoing violations. The courtโs duty is to invalidate those portions of SORA \nthat violate the Constitution. In so doing, the court recognizes that its ruling will fracture \nthe existing structure of SORA. However, the court anticipates that its ruling will reignite \nefforts to finalize a new, unified registration statute that can survive constitutional \nreview, as has the national model, SORNA.  \nBut until such time as the legislature acts, SORA will be unenforceable against a \nlarge portion of registrants and may be enforced only in part against the remaining \nregistrants. \nFor the reasons explained above, the court will grant Plaintiffsโ pending motions \nand will enter permanent injunctive relief on behalf of the ex post facto subclasses and \nthe primary class. Upon the entry of final judgment in this case, Defendants will be \npermanently enjoined from enforcing any provision of SORA against members of the ex \npost facto subclasses and will be permanently enjoined from enforcing the provisions \ndescribed in Part III.B of this opinion against any registrant. The parties will immediately \nbegin efforts to formulate a joint, proposed form of judgment, which will become \neffective 60 days after entry. The court will include this 60-day window until the \njudgment becomes effective principally to allow time for the legislature to craft and enact \na new statute.  \nAdditionally, the parties will promptly begin to prepare documents sufficient to \nprovide notice of this opinion, and its impact, to all registrants, all law enforcement \nofficials, and prosecuting attorneys responsible for enforcement of SORA. As part of this \n29 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 84, PageID.1806   Filed 02/14/20   Page 30 of 32\nnotification process, Defendants must update their Explanation of Duties form provided \nto all registrants.  \nTo be clear: SORA will not become unenforceable as of the date of this order. \nRather, the holdings in this opinion will become effective and enforceable only after the \nentry of a final judgment, at the time specified in that final judgment. Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for declaratory and injunctive relief (ECF \nNo. 62) is GRANTED. Michiganโs SORA is DECLARED NULL AND VOID as applied to \nmembers of the ex post facto subclasses (any registrant whose offense requiring them \nto register, and who has not committed a subsequent offense, occurred prior to April 12, \n2011). Defendants and their agents will be ENJOINED from enforcing ANY provision of \nSORA against members of the ex post facto subclasses.  \nThe holdings in this order will not become effective until the time described in the \nJudgment, which will be entered later. \n  IT IS FURTHERED ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary \njudgment (ECF No. 75) is GRANTED. Defendants and their agents will be ENJOINED \nfrom enforcing the following provisions of SORA against any registrant: \n(a) Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \n(1) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp.

Hon. Robert H. Cleland \n \nRICHARD SNYDER, Governor of the    Mag. J. David R. Grand \nState of Michigan, and COL. KRISTE \nETUE, Director of the Michigan State      \nPolice, in their official capacities,         \n \n    Defendants. \n__________________________________________________________________ \n \nPLAINTIFFSโ SECOND AMENDED  \nVERIFIED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \nIntroduction \n \n1.  This class action is brought on behalf of individuals subject to registration \nunder Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), M.C.L. ยง 28.721 et \nseq., seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of their constitutional \nrights.  \n2.  Almost two years ago, in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016), \ncert denied, 138 S. Ct. 55 (2017) (โDoes Iโ), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \nheld that SORA imposes punishment and that retroactive application of SORAโs \n2006 and 2011 amendments violates the U.S. Constitutionโs Ex Post Facto Clause.  \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.346   Filed 06/28/18   Page 2 of 47\n3.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan continues to subject tens of thousands of \nregistrants to retroactive punishment under SORA.  \n4.  More than three years ago, this Court held (1) that SORAโs prohibitions on \nworking, residing, or loitering in exclusion zones are unconstitutionally vague; (2) \nthat certain of SORAโs reporting requirements are unconstitutionally vague; (3) \nthat imposing strict liability for SORA violations violates due process (and there-\nfore SORA therefore must be read to incorporate a knowledge requirement); and \n(4) that the requirement to report certain electronic identifiers immediately violates \nthe First Amendment. See Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. \n2015).  \n5.  In a subsequent opinion, Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. Supp. 3d 722 (E.D. \nMich. 2015), this Court further held that the retroactive incorporation of the life-\ntime registration obligation to report certain electronic identifiers also violates the \nFirst Amendment.1  \n6.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan continues to subject tens of thousands of \nregistrants to these unconstitutional provisions. \n7.  The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, now \nseek to ensure that all affected Michigan registrants will not suffer unconstitutional \n                                           \n1 The Sixth Circuit reversed this Courtโs earlier decision, which had granted the \nstateโs motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffsโ ex post facto claim. See 932 F. Supp. \n2d 803 (E.D. Mich. 2013), reversed by 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth \nCircuit did not reach the issues decided by this Court in its twin 2015 decisions.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.347   Filed 06/28/18   Page 3 of 47\nretroactive punishment in violation of the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I; will \nnot be subjected in the future to SORA provisions found to be unconstitutional by \nthis Court; and will be treated uniformly and consistently statewide.  \n8.  To effect that relief, the plaintiffs seek to certify a class of Michigan regis-\ntrants, all of whom seek to have the benefits of this Courtโs 2015 forward-looking \ndecisions applied to them (the โprimary classโ).  \n9.  The plaintiffs also seek to certify an โex post facto subclassโ comprised of \nindividuals who committed the offense or offenses requiring registration before \nApril 12, 2011, all of whom seek to have the benefits of the Sixth Circuitโs back-\nward-looking decision applied to them.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10. Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343 because the plain-\ntiffs seek redress under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by \nthe United States Constitution.  \n11. The plaintiffsโ requests for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized \nby 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201-2202, by Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65, and by the legal and \nequitable powers of this Court. \n12. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.348   Filed 06/28/18   Page 4 of 47\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs2 \nJohn Doe #1 \n13.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.  \n14.  In early 2000, when Mr. Doe #1 was a 19-year-old senior in high school, he \nhad a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old freshman girl.  \n15.  After school one day the two went to Mr. Doe #1โs house and had sexual \nintercourse. The police arrested Mr. Doe #1 about a week later, and he admitted to \nthem that he had sex with the girl.  \n16. The girl gave various statements to the police, initially saying that the sex \nwas not consensual, but later stating that that while she felt pressured to have sex, \nMr. Doe #1 did not force her or threaten her to perform any sexual acts.  \n17. After Mr. Doe #1โs attorney explained to him that the girl could not legally \ngive consent because she was underage, Mr. Doe #1 pled guilty in June 2000 to \ncriminal sexual conduct in the third degree (attempt) under the Holmes Youthful \nTrainee Act (HYTA), a record-sealing statute that allows young offenders to have \ntheir cases dismissed and their records sealed. See M.C.L. ยง 762.1 et seq.  \n                                           \n2 Declarations verifying the facts in this complaint are attached as Exhibits A-F. \nThe previously filed First Amended Complaint, ECF #8, named two plaintiffs. The \nindividual identified in that complaint as John Doe #1 is now identified as John \nDoe #6. The individual identified in that complaint as John Doe #2 has withdrawn \nfrom this litigation.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.349   Filed 06/28/18   Page 5 of 47\n18. Mr. Doe #1 was sentenced to 60 days in jail, of which he served a little over \na month, and three years of probation.  \n19. In the summer of 2001, Mr. Doe #1 attended a volleyball game at his former \nhigh school with a friend, to cheer for the friendโs sister. At the game, Mr. Doe #1 \nsaw the victim from his case and immediately left the premises. He reported the \nincident to his probation officer.  \n20. Mr. Doe #1 knew that he was not allowed any contact with the girl, but was \nunaware that he was prohibited from going to the school. Mr. Doe #1โs HYTA \nstatus was revoked in May 2001 as a result of his having attended the volleyball \ngame, and his probation was extended for two more years. \n21. Mr. Doe #1 completed probation in June 2005.  \n22. Mr. Doe #1 was approximately four years six months older than the girl with \nwhom he had sex. Had the age difference been less than four years, Mr. Doe #1 \nwould not be subject to sex offender registration. M.C.L. ยง 28.722(w)(iv).  \n23. Mr. Doe #1 has no other criminal convictions.  \n24. SORAโs amendments, including those in 2006 and 2011, have been applied \nretroactively to Mr. Doe #1. Before 2011, Mr. Doe #1 was required to comply with \nSORA for twenty-five years. In 2011, he was retroactively classified as a Tier III \noffender and his registration term was extended to life.  \n25. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have required Mr. Doe #1 to \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.350   Filed 06/28/18   Page 6 of 47\ncomply with all of the provisions of SORA including the 2006 and 2011 amend-\nments, have labeled him as a Tier III offender, and have subjected him to lifetime \nregistration. \nJohn Doe #2 \n26. Plaintiff John Doe #2 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.  \n27. In the early 2000s, Mr. Doe #2โs father and stepmother divorced. Not long \nafter the divorce or separation, Mr. Doe #2โs stepmother accused him of having \nengaged in sexual activity with her daughter (his stepsister) during the 1990s, when \nhe was a teenager.   \n28. Mr. Doe #2 denied the allegations, but facing three counts of criminal sexual \nconduct in the first degree, in May 2004 on the advice of counsel he pled guilty to \none count of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree under HYTA. See M.C.L. \nยง 762.1 et seq. He successfully completed HYTA in 2007, after serving probation, \nand his charges were dismissed.  \n29. HYTA provides that if a youth between the ages of 17 and 24 pleads guilty, \nthe court โwithout entering a judgment of convictionโ may assign that individual to \nthe status of youthful trainee.โ M.C.L. ยง 762.11(1). If the youth completes the \ntrainee period โ typically a period of probation โ then โthe court shall discharge the \nindividual and dismiss the proceeding.โ M.C.L. ยง 762.14(1). \n30.  An assignment to youthful trainee status โis not a conviction for a crime.โ \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.351   Filed 06/28/18   Page 7 of 47\nM.C.L. ยง 762.14(2). Moreover, โall proceedings regarding the disposition of the \ncriminal charge and the individualโs assignment as youthful trainee shall be closed \nto public inspection,โ M.C.L. ยง 762.14(4), meaning that court records in HYTA \ncases are sealed and do not appear on the personโs criminal history.  \n31. Mr. Doe #2โs dismissed charges do not appear on a background check. \nUnder SORA, however, Mr. Doe #2 is publicly labeled as a convicted sex offender \neven though his case was dismissed and he has no criminal record. \n32. SORA is not limited to convicted people, but requires registration and \nreporting by people who were never convicted of a crime, such as Mr. Doe #2. \n33. Mr. Doe #2 has no other sexual offenses. He has two misdemeanors for \noperating while impaired.  \n34. SORAโs amendments, including those in 2006 and 2011, have been applied \nretroactively to Mr. Doe #1. Before 2011, Mr. Doe #2 was required to comply with \nSORA for twenty-five years. In 2011, he was retroactively classified as a Tier III \noffender and his registration term was extended to life.  \n35. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to require that \nMr. Doe #2 comply with all of the provisions of SORA including the 2006 and \n2011 amendments, to label him as a Tier III offender, and to subject him to lifetime \nregistration.  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.352   Filed 06/28/18   Page 8 of 47\nJohn Doe #3 \n36. Plaintiff John Doe #3 resides in the Western District of Michigan.  \n37. Mr. Doe #3, raised by adoptive parents, was born with Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome (FAS), an incurable birth defect resulting from in-utero alcohol \nexposure.  \n38. Mr. Doe #3โs in-utero alcohol exposure left him with various neurological \ndeficits. He has a developmental age of nine or ten, and an IQ of approximately 84.  \n39. Mr. Doe #3โs developmental delays make him vulnerable, and in the early \n1990s he was sexually assaulted by a co-worker.  \n40. In the summer of 1994, Mr. Doe #3 was accused of engaging in inappropri-\nate sexual touching of his six-year-old nephew. At the time, Mr. Doe #3 had a \nchronological age of 21. \n41. Several psychologists provided detailed testimony that Mr. Doe #3โs actions \nwere similar to that of a child, and that given his level of developmental and intel-\nlectual functioning, his actions should be viewed as those of a child engaged in \nsexual experimentation, which is common. Mr. Doe #3 had no history of related \nbehavior.  \n42. Mr. Doe #3 pled nolo contendere in December 1994 to three counts of crim-\ninal sexual conduct in the second degree. He was sentenced to 90 days, as well as \nfive yearsโ probation, which he successfully completed without incident.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.353   Filed 06/28/18   Page 9 of 47\n43. When Michiganโs first Sex Offenders Registration Act came into effect in \nOctober 1995, Mr. Doe #3 was placed on a non-public law enforcement registry, \nand was required to update his address with law enforcement if he moved. He was \nsubject to registration for 25 years.  \n44. SORAโs various amendments have been retroactively applied to him, \nincluding the 1999 amendments extending his registration period to life and the \n2006 amendments subjecting him to exclusion zones. In 2011, Mr. Doe #3 was \nretroactively classified as a Tier III offender.  \n45. Mr. Doe #3 has no other criminal history. \n46. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to label Mr. \nDoe #3 as a Tier III offender and to require him to comply with all of the provi-\nsions of SORA, including its 2006 and 2011 amendments. \nJohn Doe #4 \n47. Plaintiff John Doe #4 resides in the Western District of Michigan. \n48. Starting around 2009, when Mr. Doe #4 was in his early 20s, he began \nflirting by text with an underage girl. The two eventually started dating, and they \nhad a relationship for about three years. Because Mr. Doe #4 was in college, they \ndid not see each other often.  \n49. The girlโs parents did not approve of their relationship. In 2012, when the \ngirl was 17, Mr. Doe #4 was interviewed by the police about whether he had sexual \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.354   Filed 06/28/18   Page 10 of 47\ncontact with his girlfriend before she turned 16.  \n50. Mr. Doe #4 admitted to the police that he and his girlfriend had had oral sex, \nbut maintained that this did not occur until after the girl was 16 years old. He said \nthey did not have sexual intercourse.  \n51. The offense allegedly occurred in 2010, shortly before the girlโs sixteenth \nbirthday. \n52. In 2013, Mr. Doe #4 pled guilty to sexual misconduct in the fourth degree. \nHe took this plea agreement after the prosecutor threatened to bring child porno-\ngraphy charges based on the fact that Mr. Doe #4 and his girlfriend had exchanged \nnude photos via text messages. Mr. Doe #4 admitted that he had the photos. \n53. Mr. Doe #4 served 10 days in jail, and was placed on probation for five \nyears. \n54. Under SORA, Mr. Doe #4 must register for 25 years, and is labeled as a Tier \nII offender.  \n55. Mr. Doe #4 has no other criminal convictions.  \n56. Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to require Mr. \nDoe #4 to comply with all of the provisions of SORA including the 2011 amend-\nments, even though his offense preceded those amendments. The state has also \ncontinued to label him as a Tier II offender. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.355   Filed 06/28/18   Page 11 of 47\nJohn Doe #5 \n57.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.  \n58.  In November 2006, when Mr. Doe #5 was living in Omaha, Nebraska, he \ndeveloped a relationship with boy who was 14 or 15 at the time. The two engaged \nin sexual touching. Mr. Doe #5 was convicted of sexual assault of a child, Nebras-\nka Rev. Statute 28 โ 320.01.   \n59.  Mr. Doe #5 was sentenced to 18 months of incarceration. He was informed \nthat under Nebraska law, he would be required to register as a sex offender for ten \nyears.  \n60.  In 2010, Mr. Doe #5 moved to Michigan to be closer to his family. Under \nMichiganโs SORA, he was subject to registration for 25 years.  \n61.  In 2011, Mr. Doe #5 was retroactively classified as a Tier III offender and \nhis registration term was extended to life.  \n62.  Mr. Doe #5 has no other criminal convictions.  \n63.  Even after the Does I decision, the defendants have continued to require Mr. \nDoe #5 to comply with all of the provisions of SORA, including the 2011 amend-\nments, to label him as a Tier III offender, and to subject him to lifetime registra-\ntion. \n \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.356   Filed 06/28/18   Page 12 of 47\nJohn Doe #6 \n64.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 resides in the Eastern District of Michigan.3 \n65.  In December 2015, Mr. Doe #6 pled nolo contendere to criminal sexual \nconduct in the fourth degree for engaging in unwanted sexual contact with a \nwaitress who worked in a restaurant he owns. Mr. Doe #6 believed the sexual \ntouching was consensual.  \n66.  Mr. Doe #6 received no jail time, but was sentenced to five years of \nprobation. He has no other criminal convictions. \n67.  Under SORA, Mr. Doe #6 is classified as a Tier I offender, and is subject to \nSORA for 15 years.4  \nDefendants \nGovernor Richard Snyder \n68. Defendant Richard Snyder is the Governor of Michigan. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity.   \n69. Pursuant to Article 5, ยง 1 of the Michigan Constitution, the executive power \nof the state is vested in the governor. The Michigan Constitution further provides \nthat the governor shall take care that applicable federal and state laws are faithfully \nexecuted. Mich. Const., Art. 5, ยง 8.  \n                                           \n3 John Doe #6 was identified as John Doe #1 in the original complaint. \n4 As a Tier I registrant, Mr. Doe #6 is not listed on the public sex offender registry. \nM.C.L. ยง 28.728(4)(c).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.357   Filed 06/28/18   Page 13 of 47\n70.  Defendant Snyder is ultimately responsible for the enforcement of the laws \nof this state, and for supervision of all state departments, including the Michigan \nState Police.   \n71.  The Governor is an appropriate defendant in a case challenging the constitu-\ntionality of a state statute.  \nColonel Kriste Etue \n72.  Defendant Colonel Kriste Etue is the director of the Michigan State Police. \nShe is sued in her official capacity.   \n73.  The Michigan State Police maintains Michiganโs sex offender registry. \nM.C.L. ยง 28.721 et seq.  \n74.  The State Policeโs responsibilities include enforcing SORA, maintaining the \nstateโs database of sex offenders, maintaining an online public sex offender regis-\ntry, registering offenders (along with other law enforcement agencies), developing \nregistration forms, providing statutorily required notices to registrants, collecting \nregistration fees, and coordinating with national law enforcement and the national \nsex offender registry. See M.C.L. ยงยง 28.724, 28.724a, and 28.725 et seq.  \n75.  The director of the Michigan State Police is an appropriate defendant in a \ncase challenging the constitutionality of Michiganโs SORA.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.358   Filed 06/28/18   Page 14 of 47\nFACTS \nHistory of the Michigan Sex Offender Registration Act \n76. Today SORA imposes obligations, disabilities, and restraints that are so \nextensive that the Sixth Circuit found them to be punishment. Those obligations, \ndisabilities, and restraints, which are too extensive to be set out in full here, are \nlisted in Exhibit G, incorporated by reference.  \n77. It was not always so. Michigan passed its first sex offender registration law \nin 1994. Mich. Pub. Act 295 (1994) (eff. 10/1/95). Before that time, Michigan did \nnot require anyone to register as a sex offender for any purpose.  \n78. The 1994 statute established a private law enforcement database containing \nbasic information about people convicted of sex offenses. Registration information \nwas exempt from all public disclosure. The statute did not require regular verifica-\ntion or reporting.  \n79. After the initial registration was completed, the only additional obligation \nwas to notify local law enforcement within 10 days of a change of address. The \nregistrant did not need to notify law enforcement in person. Mich. Pub. Act 295, \nSec. 5(1) (1994). Registry information was maintained for 25 years for individuals \nconvicted of one offense and for life for individuals convicted of multiple offenses. \nMich. Pub. Act 295, Sec. 5(3)-(4) (1994).   \n80. Since that time, the legislature has repeatedly amended the statute, each time \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.359   Filed 06/28/18   Page 15 of 47\nimposing a stricter regime with new burdens on registrants, covering more people \nand more conduct. The 2006 and 2011 amendments are particularly relevant here. \n81. The 2006 amendments (effective 1/1/06) retroactively barred registrants \n(with limited exceptions) from working, residing, or loitering within 1000 feet of \nschool property, and imposed criminal penalties for noncompliance. Mich. Pub. \nActs 121, 127 (2005). In addition, the penalties for registration-related offenses \nwere increased. Mich. Pub. Act 132 (2005). Another amendment, which was also \napplied retroactively, allowed subscribing members of the public to receive elec-\ntronic notification when a person registers or moves into a particular zip code. \nMich. Pub. Act. 46 (2006).  \n82. In 2011, SORA underwent major revisions which fundamentally changed \nMichiganโs sex offender registry. Mich. Pub. Act. 17-18 (2011). \n83. First, the 2011 SORA amendments (effective 4/12/11) retroactively imposed \nextensive reporting requirements, requiring in-person and in some cases immediate \nreporting of vast amounts of personal information.  \n84. Second, the 2011 amendments retroactively categorized registrants into tiers. \nThe tier classification determines the length of time a person must register and the \nfrequency of reporting. Tier classifications are based solely on the offense of con-\nviction. Tier classifications are not based on, and do not correspond to, a regis-\ntrantโs actual risk of re-offending or the danger any registrant poses to the public.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.360   Filed 06/28/18   Page 16 of 47\n85. Before 2011, most Michigan registrants were required to register for 25 \nyears. As a result of the retroactive tier classifications, many registrants had their \nregistration periods extended to life. There was no individualized determination \nabout their risk or whether lifetime registration was warranted.  \nThe Does I Litigation \n86. In 2012, six Michigan registrants (who are not plaintiffs in this case) \nchallenged the constitutionality of SORA on numerous grounds. See Does v. \nSnyder, Case No. 2:12-cv-11194 (E.D. Mich.). \n87. The state moved to dismiss. This Court granted the motion in part and \ndenied the motion in part. See Does #1-4 v. Snyder, 932 F. Supp. 2d 803 (E.D. \nMich. 2013). The dismissal included the plaintiffsโ ex post facto claim. \n88. After discovery, this Court issued two opinions under Rule 52, Does #1-4 v. \nSnyder, 932 F. Supp. 2d 803 (E.D. Mich. 2013), and Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 F. \nSupp. 3d 722 (E.D. Mich. 2015). Those opinions held, inter alia, that: \na.  SORAโs geographic exclusion zones are unconstitutionally vague;  \nb.  SORAโs prohibition on loitering is unconstitutionally vague; \nc.  Certain of SORAโs reporting requirements are unconstitutionally vague; \nd.  Certain of SORAโs internet reporting requirements violate the First \nAmendment; and  \ne.  SORA must be read to incorporate a knowledge requirement, so that \nthere is no strict liability for SORA violations. \n \n89. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit held that SORA is punishment and that retro-\n16 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.361   Filed 06/28/18   Page 17 of 47\nactive application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments violates the Ex Post Facto \nClause. See Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016). \n90. The Sixth Circuit did not vacate this Courtโs other rulings, but rather \ndeclined to reach those issues as โnone of the contested provisions may now be \napplied to the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.โ Id. at 706. \n91. The state defendants petitioned for certiorari. That petition was denied. See \nSnyder v. John Does #1-5, 138 S. Ct. 55 (2017). \nThe Stateโs Has Failed to Amend SORA to Bring It Into  \nCompliance with the Decisions in Does I \n92. The Michigan legislature has not amended SORA to bring it into compliance \n(a) with the Sixth Circuitโs Does I decision of 2016, or (b) with this Courtโs two \nDoes decisions of 2015.  \n93. The statute continues to require that pre-2006 registrants must comply with \nthe 2006 amendments; that pre-2011 registrants must comply with the 2011 \namendments; that registrants must comply with prohibitions on residing, working, \nor โloiteringโ within 1000 feet of a school (which this Court found to be uncon-\nstitutionally vague); that registrants must comply with reporting requirements \n(which this Court found to be unconstitutionally vague or in violation of the First \nAmendment); and that registrants are strictly liable for certain SORA violations.  \n94. Since the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, several meetings of a legislative \nwork group have been held to discuss amending SORA to bring it into compliance \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.362   Filed 06/28/18   Page 18 of 47\nwith Does I, as well as to address other concerns about the statuteโs overbreadth \nand ineffectiveness. No legislation has yet been proposed. Some Michigan legisla-\ntors have indicated to members of the legislative work group that they are reluctant \nto advocate publicly for registry reform, given the political costs of doing so, and \nwould prefer that the courts resolve this issue for them. \n95. The defendants have continued in practice to require plaintiffs John Does \n#1-6 and similarly situated registrants (other than the plaintiffs in Does I and other \ncivil actions) to comply with the provisions of SORA that this Court and the Sixth \nCircuit found to be unconstitutional in 2015 and 2016. \nThe Stateโs Continued Retroactive Enforcement  \nof the 2006 and 2011 Amendments \n96. Under the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, the following SORA amend-\nments cannot be applied retroactively: \na.  the 2006 amendments that bar registrants from residing, working, or \nloitering within 1000 feet of a school;  \nb.  the 2006 amendments that allow subscribing members of the public to \nreceive electronic notifications about registrants;  \nc.  the 2011 amendments that categorize registrants into tiers and \nlengthen their registration terms; and \nd.  the 2011 amendments requiring Michiganโs internet-based, public \nregistry to label registrants by tier level; \ne.  the 2011 amendments requiring extensive reporting and in-person, \nimmediate reporting. \n  \n97. Nevertheless, the defendants have continued to apply these SORA provi-\nsions retroactively to plaintiffs John Does #1-6, and to members of the putative ex \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.363   Filed 06/28/18   Page 19 of 47\npost facto subclass defined below. The defendants continue to require registrants \nwhose offenses predate the 2006 amendments, including plaintiffs John Does #1-3, \nto comply with the exclusion zones, and the Michigan State Police public sex \noffender registry continues to allow the public to subscribe to electronic notifica-\ntions about them. \n98. The defendants continue to categorize registrants whose offenses predate the \n2011 amendments, including plaintiffs John Does #1-5, into tiers. The defendants \ncontinue to publicly label them by tier on Michiganโs internet-based public regis-\ntry; continue to apply the retroactively lengthened registration terms to them; and \ncontinue to require them to comply with the extensive reporting requirements \nadopted in 2011.   \n99. When plaintiffs John Does #1-6 and members of the putative class register, \nthe registering agency is supposed to provide them with a Michigan Sex Offender \nVerification/Update Form, which serves as proof of their registration. This form \nalso includes an Explanation of Duties to Register as a Sex Offender, which \nsummarizes the requirements of SORA with which the registrant must comply. See \nExhibit H (samples of verification forms that the six plaintiffs were given at recent \nregistration visits).  \n100.  Upon information and belief, the state provides the same Explanation of \nDuties form to everyone. This means that plaintiffs John Does #1-5, and the mem-\n19 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.364   Filed 06/28/18   Page 20 of 47\nbers of the putative ex post facto subclass, get the same form as registrants whose \noffenses post-date the 2011 SORA amendments. \n101.  The Verification/Update Form states the registrantโs tier classification and \nnotes that the length of the personโs registration is based on that tier classification.  \n102.  The Explanation of Duties notifies registrants they are subject to criminal \nprosecution and punishment if they do not comply with certain SORA require-\nments that were part of the 2006 and 2011 SORA amendments. See Exhibit H. \n103.  Specifically, the Explanation of Duties informs registrants that: \na.  โUnless otherwise specified by law,โ they are โprohibited by law from \nresiding or working within 1,000 feet from any building, facility, struc-\nture or real property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by a public, \nprivate, denominational, or parochial school offering developmental \nkindergarten, kindergarten, or any grade from one through twelve.โ \nb.  They are โprohibited by law from loitering within 1,000 feet from any \nbuilding, facility, structure or real property owned, leased, or otherwise \ncontrolled by a public, private, denominational, or parochial school \noffering developmental kindergarten, kindergarten, or any grade from \none through twelve.โ \nc.  The length of their registration period is determined by their tier classi-\nfication; if they are Tier III registrants they must register for life. They \nmust comply with the extensive and immediate in-person reporting \nrequirements, such as providing information about travel, electronic \nidentifiers, and employers. \n \nSee Exhibit H. \n \n104.  Under the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, all of these statements are \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.365   Filed 06/28/18   Page 21 of 47\nfalse because these provisions cannot be applied retroactively consistent with the \nEx Post Facto Clause.  \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Vague Exclusion Zones \n105.  Under SORA, the plaintiffs are barred from residing, working, or โloiter-\ningโ within a โstudent safety zone.โ M.C.L. ยงยง 28.733-735.5  \n106.  This Court held in 2015 that SORAโs prohibitions on residing, working, \nand loitering within an exclusion zone are unconstitutionally vague.  \n107.  Nevertheless, the defendants continue to require all registrants, including \nthe plaintiffs, to comply with these SORA provisions, and have failed to amend the \nrequirements in the Explanation of Duties provided to all registrants. See Exh. H. \n108.  The State of Michigan does not make maps available to the public showing \nwhere the exclusion zones are located or what their boundaries are.   \n109.  The exclusion zones cover vast areas, especially in urban and suburban \nregions. In some small towns with centrally located schools, nearly the whole town \nโ or at least the residential areas โ can be within 1000 feet of a school.  \n110.  Because exclusion zones are measured as the crow flies, rather than as \npeople actually travel between two points, some exclusion zones โ like those that \nencompass a river or an interstate highway โ cover areas that are within 1000 feet \nof a school as the crow flies but that would require a person to walk or drive many \n                                           \n5 Plaintiff John Doe #2 is exempt from the school exclusion zones because he was \nnot convicted of a crime but was adjudicated under HYTA. M.C.L. ยง 28.736(1)(c). \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.366   Filed 06/28/18   Page 22 of 47\ntimes that distance to actually get from the residence or workplace to the school. \n111.  Exclusion zones put a significant percentage of the area of cities and towns \noff-limits. As a result, exclusion zones severely restrict access to employment and \nhousing, and limit registrantsโ ability to engage in normal human activity. \n112.  It is impossible for ordinary people to identify the areas that are inside and \noutside the exclusion zones. The task is difficult even for experts with sophisticat-\ned mapping technology. Distances are difficult to estimate or measure and property \nboundaries are difficult to locate. Moreover, exclusion zones often have irregular \nshapes, because they are measured from property boundaries and some zones over-\nlap. Exclusion zones are not shaped like simple circles around a fixed point.  \n113.  It is impossible for the plaintiffs to comply with the prohibition on โloiter-\ning,โ which requires moment-to-moment knowledge of whether or not they are in \nan exclusion zone.  \n114.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 has been employed for six years in a manufacturing \nplant. Employees are frequently transferred from one plant to another. Mr. Doe #1 \nprefers staying at the plant he currently works at because it does not fall within an \nexclusion zone. But he does not have the option to refuse to be transferred. If he \nrefuses, he risks discipline or being fired. He believes that some of his employerโs \nplants may fall within exclusion zones, and fears that he could be transferred, \neither temporarily or permanently, to a different plant that might be in an exclusion \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.367   Filed 06/28/18   Page 23 of 47\nzone. Mr. Doe #1 worries that he could lose his job, and worries about finding new \nwork outside an exclusion zone if he does. \n115.  SORAโs exclusion zones have also made it difficult for Mr. Doe #1 to \ndetermine where he can live. Despite using Google maps, he is often unsure \nwhether a particular property is or is not within an exclusion zone. \n116.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 has worked in a variety of jobs, such as food service, \nevent set-up, and custodial services. He has repeatedly been let go when an \nemployer learned that he was on the registry. He then had to look for new work.  \n117.  When applying for jobs, Mr. Doe #3 has to figure out whether he is legally \npermitted to work there, which can be difficult. Every time he applies for work he \nfirst has to go to the police station to try to find out whether the job is within an \nexclusion zone. His local police department determines this by checking with the \nstate police.  \n118.  In some of Mr. Doe #3โs jobs, his employers have assigned him to various \nlocations, but he does not know whether those locations are within exclusion zones \nor how long he can work in any one location before being in violation of SORA. \nFor example, he was representing a developmental disabilities organization at an \nevent, when he realized that he might be within an exclusion zone, and so he left. \n119.  In 2017, Mr. Doe #3 married a woman who also has Fetal Alcohol Syn-\ndrome and who lives with her parents. Mr. Doe #3 is uncertain whether his wifeโs \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.368   Filed 06/28/18   Page 24 of 47\nparentsโ home is within an exclusion zone, and does not know when or how often \nhe can visit her without being in violation of SORA. \n120.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 had found it difficult or impossible to identify the \nlocations and boundaries of exclusion zones, which has affected his employment. \nHe works in construction and is often assigned to different jobs sites. When he is \nasked to work at a new job location, he makes his best effort to check if the job site \nfalls within an exclusion zone by using Google Maps. But it is often impossible to \nfigure out whether or not a job site is within a zone.  \n121.  Sometimes Mr. Does #4 goes to a job site โ and those sites can be located \nseveral hours away โ only to find when he arrives that the site is close to a school. \nHe then cannot take on the assignment his employer has given him, and must go \nhome, which costs him income and creates problems for his employer. Mr. Doe #4 \nwas unable to tell in advance using Google Maps that these sites were off limits.  \n122.  When Mr. Doe #4 was looking for a home, it was difficult or impossible \nfor him to determine whether potential homes were within exclusion zones. For \nexample, one home was within 1000 feet of a school bus yard, and Mr. Doe #4 was \nunsure, despite internet research, whether he could live in that home. He also had \ndifficulty determining whether homes were or were not within 1000 feet of a \nschool. \n123.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 has been unable to determine what he can and cannot \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.369   Filed 06/28/18   Page 25 of 47\ndo within exclusion zones. For a while he dated a person who lived in an exclusion \nzone; he inquired with the police whether he could visit during times when school \nis not in session, but was told he could not. \n124.  Mr. Doe #6 lived with his wife and children in an apartment that was \nattached to a restaurant that the family had owned and operated for years. At his \nprobation interview he was told that he could not work at the restaurant or live with \nhis wife and children because the structures were within an exclusion zone.  \n125.  Mr. Doe #6 wants to visit his family during the day (and sometimes does \nso) but he is unsure how much time he can spend with his wife and children before \nhe is in violation of SORA.  \n126.  Mr. Doe #6 has moved twice in the last two years and his wife has to put in \nextra hours at the restaurant because he is forbidden from working there.  \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Vague Loitering Provision \n127.  SORA severely impairs the plaintiffsโ and putative class membersโ family \nrelationships and parenting, in large part because the statute bars them from โloit-\neringโ within 1000 feet of school property, and the plaintiffs do not know what that \nprovision means. M.C.L. ยง 28.734.  \n128.  SORA defines โloiterโ as โto remain for a period of time and under \ncircumstances that a reasonable person would determine is for the primary purpose \nof observing or contacting minors.โ M.C.L. ยง 28.733(b). This provision contains \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.370   Filed 06/28/18   Page 26 of 47\nno exception for registrants who are parents spending time with their own children, \nor who are observing or accompanying the children of friends or family members.  \n129.  Because of the vagueness of SORAโs loitering provision, the plaintiffs and \nputative class members cannot know if or how SORA applies to their parenting \nactivities, to their relationships with other young family members, or to other \ninteractions with children. The plaintiffs and putative class members are unsure \nwhat actions are unlawful under SORAโs loitering prohibition. \n130.  Due to this uncertainty, the plaintiffs and putative class members do not \nattend or are fearful of attending parent-teacher conferences and other school \nevents. They are uncertain about where they can or cannot take their children, or \nwhether they can pick their children up from school. They are unable to decipher \nwhich of their childrenโs events they can or cannot attend, and live in fear of \nprosecution for misunderstanding the requirements.   \n131.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 is unable to attend his sonโs school-sponsored \nsporting events for fear that doing so would violate SORA. Doe #1โs six-year-old \nson plays multiple sports, and games and practices are generally held at his \nelementary school. Mr. Doe #1 has not been able to attend any of these events, \nbecause he has been unable to determine whether watching one of these events \nwould constitute loitering.  \n132.  In April 2018, Mr. Doe #1 contacted the local prosecutorโs office to ask if \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.371   Filed 06/28/18   Page 27 of 47\nhe could be prosecuted for attending his sonโs games. The office refused to provide \nan official answer and redirected him to the Sex Offenders Registration Unit of the \nMichigan State Police. When Mr. Doe #1 contacted the MSP Sex Offenders Regis-\ntration Unit, that office similarly refused to provide an official answer and referred \nhim back to local law enforcement. \n133.  Mr. Doe #1 also avoids attending his sonโs school events, such as a father-\nson breakfast, a holiday concert, a school carnival, and field trips, because he does \nnot know whether doing so would be a crime under SORA. Mr. Doe #1 has been \nasked to coach his sonโs baseball team, but declined to avoid the risk that he would \nbe violating SORAโs loitering prohibition. \n134.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 does not have children of his own, but is close with \nhis extended family. He is unsure whether he can attend high school sports events, \nconcerts, other school events, or graduations of family members. He is also is \nuncertain whether he can go to his local public library (because it is within 1000 \nfeet of a school). \n135.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 is unsure what activities are or are not permitted \nunder the loitering provision. He would like to but does not attend church because \nthere is a Sunday school there. He does not attend sports or school events for his \nnephews, nieces, or friendsโ kids on school property, because he does not know \nwhether he can.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.372   Filed 06/28/18   Page 28 of 47\n136.  Mr. Doe #4 has a very large family, and they sometimes hold their Christ-\nmas celebration in a hall. The family learned that their 2017 venue fell within an \nexclusion zone only one day before the event, and feared that this meant Mr. Doe \n#4 could not participate. The family lost their security deposit, and had to settle for \na less desirable location, so that Mr. Doe #4 could attend. \n137.  Mr. Doe #4 wants to become a father in the future, and his biggest concern \nabout being on the registry is that he will not be able to participate in his childrenโs \nevents, or even know whether he can or cannot participate. \n138.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 does not have children. However, he fears daily that \nhe will inadvertently violate one of the SORA provisions regarding his exclusion \nfrom school zones due to there not being a map he could reference to be certain. \nHe often worries that he may be in a school zone unintentionally and be subject to \nprosecution because of it. \n139.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 often takes walks, but he does not have any idea of \nprecisely where the school exclusion zones begin or end. He refrains from walking \noutside of places where he knows the neighborhood, because he might stop at a \npark or a bench and only later realize that it was close to a school.    \n140.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 has daughters who are 14 and 16. He used to attend \nparent-teacher conferences and school events like band concerts. Now he does not \ngo on to school property because he is afraid he will be accused of โloiteringโ in a \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.373   Filed 06/28/18   Page 29 of 47\nschool safety zone. He is even anxious about picking up his girls off school \nproperty since he does not know whether doing so might violate SORAโs safety \nzone provisions. \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Vague Reporting \nRequirements  \n \n141.  This Court held in 2015 that SORAโs provisions requiring reporting of \ntelephone numbers, electronic mail and instant message addresses, and vehicle \ninformation were unconstitutionally vague.  \n142.  Nevertheless, the defendants continue to require the plaintiffs and putative \nclass members to comply with those SORA provisions. The Explanation of Duties \ninforms registrants that they must provide information about telephone numbers \nthat they โroutinely use,โ electronic address or instant message address that they \nโroutinely useโ and information about vehicles they โregularly operate.โ See \nExhibit H. \n143.  SORAโs requirements for reporting personal information are so vague that \nthe plaintiffs and putative class members do not understand what information must \nbe reported, or what changes in information subject them to the in-person immedi-\nate reporting requirement. The John Doe plaintiffs and putative class members \ncannot know whether or not they are in violation of the law. Moreover, different \nlaw enforcement agencies in different places apply SORAโs requirements differ-\nently.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.374   Filed 06/28/18   Page 30 of 47\n144.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 has gotten conflicting information about what he \nmust report. For example, at one point his family planned a trip to Disney World in \nFlorida. He was unable to attend, however, due to his uncertainty of the SORA \nstatute and its application in other states.  \n145.  Plaintiff John Doe #2 isnโt sure what information he must report and he has \ngotten conflicting information about what he must report. For example, when he \nwanted to go on a cruise departing from a Florida port, local law enforcement in \nMichigan told him he would have to report immediately and daily to the authorities \nin Florida, and that because he would be out of Michigan for more than seven days \nhe would have to report in advance where he was going to be staying.  \n146.  Mr. Doe #2 was booking his lodging through Priceline in order to get last-\nminute deals and didnโt know in advance where he would be staying (at either end \nof the cruise).  \n147.  Ultimately the state police overrode local enforcement and said he could \ngo to Florida without knowing in advance where he would be staying, and Florida \nauthorities told him he didnโt need to register if he was only going to be in Florida \nfor a day or two before and after his cruise.  \n148.  Mr. Doe #2 would like to travel in the U.S. and internationally, but he dis-\ntrusts the information he gets from law enforcement and he is afraid that he will \nmake a mistake with his reporting requirements and be prosecuted for a felony.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.375   Filed 06/28/18   Page 31 of 47\n149.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 tries to report everything he thinks he may need to \nreport. For example, he has his own vehicle, but also reports his parentsโ vehicle \nbecause he occasionally drives it and isnโt sure whether he needs to report it. \n150.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 is fearful of using any vehicle that is not registered to \nhim. When his car breaks down, he does not borrow a vehicle from friends or \nfamily because he is uncertain whether he would have to register it. His family \nowns a boat, but Mr. Doe #4 does not use it, because he is uncertain about whether \nor how often he could use it without being required to register it. Similarly, his \nbrothers own ATVs; when the family goes camping, Mr. Doe #4 does not take out \nthe ATVs because he is unclear about whether he would then have to register them.  \n151.  Mr. Doe #4 drives multiple company vehicles. One of his employers had \nabout 30 vehicles and his current employer has about 4. When Mr. Doe #4 inquired \nat his local police station if he needed to register all of these vehicles, the police \ndid not know and so they called the state police.  \n152.  The state police said he did not have to register them, but that the local \npolice should put a note in his record. Mr. Doe #4 has no written confirmation of \nthis in his own records, and is fearful when he drives his employersโ vehicles that \nhe could be violating SORA. He also does not know whether he needs to register \nthe construction equipment he drives, which his employer typically rents for a \ncouple days or for the length of a construction job.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.376   Filed 06/28/18   Page 32 of 47\n153.  Mr. Doe #4 is a good driver, but if the weather is bad and his friends or \nfamily ask him to drive due to the snow, he declines because he does not know \nwhether driving their vehicles would be a violation of SORA. Similarly, when he \ngoes out with friends and they ask him to drive because they have been drinking \nand he has not, he again does not drive because that could be a violation of SORA.  \n154.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 has registered four vehicles that his family owns. As \nwith everything having to do with SORA, he errs on the side of caution and \nrestricts or limits his behavior to be certain that he is not violating the law. \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of SORAโs Internet Reporting \nRequirements in Violation of the First Amendment \n155.  SORA severely restricts the plaintiffsโ and putative class membersโ ability \nto speak freely on the internet. They must provide law enforcement with all elec-\ntronic mail addresses, instant message addresses, log-in names, or other identifiers \nthat are assigned to or routinely used by them, M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(i). In addition, \nthey must report in person within three days whenever they establish any electronic \nmail address, instant message address, or other designation used in internet com-\nmunications or postings. M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f).  \n156.  This Court held in 2015 that SORAโs provisions requiring immediate in-\nperson reporting of certain electronic information and SORAโs retroactive incor-\nporation of the lifetime registration requirement for certain electronic information \nviolate the First Amendment. \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.377   Filed 06/28/18   Page 33 of 47\n157.  Nevertheless, the defendants continue to require the plaintiffs John Does \n#1-6 and the putative class members to comply with those SORA provisions. The \nExplanation of Duties informs registrants that they must immediately report in \nperson โany electronic mail (e-mail address), instant messaging address, or any \nother designation used in internet communications upon establishing it.โ See \nExhibit H.  \n158.  The plaintiffs and putative class members fear using the internet because \nSORA is unclear about whether, for example, they must report immediately and in \nperson if they set up an on-line account to facilitate basic transactions such as the \npayment of taxes, registration with media streaming services, or purchases on web-\nsites like Amazon.  \n159.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 restricts his internet use because he must report in \nperson within three days every time he creates a new internet account. Once he was \nautomatically assigned a new account when signing up for a service; to be safe he \nhad to go to the registration office within three days to report it.  \n160.  Plaintiff Doe #2 is afraid to use the internet because he must provide all \nemail and internet identifiers. For the most part Mr. Doe #2 avoids social media \nand accounts that would require him to register within three days. His attitude is \nthat he would rather be safe than sorry, and that it is safest to limit his internet use \nthan to risk compliance issues with SORA.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.378   Filed 06/28/18   Page 34 of 47\n161.  Mr. Doe #2 works at a bank and he recently completed an on-line MBA. \nHe would have preferred to attend a bricks-and-mortar school, but to do so he \nwould have had to register with the school and place the school on the registry. He \nwas also worried about not knowing what he would have to report with regard to \nin-class or group assignments involving immediate on-line research or searches.  \n162.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 is reluctant to use the internet, and no longer main-\ntains a social media profile on Facebook, Twitter, or social media sites, due to \nSORAโs reporting and registration requirements. He tries not to use any chat or \ninstant messaging functions on the internet, because that can require creating a \nscreen name, which then triggers a reporting requirement. His father died in \nDecember, and he wanted to participate in on-line grief support, but would have \nhad to register his screen name so he chose not to participate.  \n163.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 limits his use of the internet because he does not \nwant to create new electronic identifiers that would require him to take time off \nwork to go report in person. He does not know what electronic identifiers he has to \nreport. He does not use social media. He is currently enrolled in an online MBA \nprogram, and is concerned about whether he will have to create and report new \nidentifiers in that program.   \n164.  Plaintiff John Doe #5 avoids all internet websites that require a username \nand severely restricts his internet use because he is unsure what information he \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.379   Filed 06/28/18   Page 35 of 47\nmust report and does not want to report in person each time he creates a new \nidentifier. For example, he is interested in advocacy on LGBT issues and would \nlike to comment on websites related to these issues. But he does not do so because \nthat requires creating an account and then registering it in person with the police.  \n165.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 gave up his Facebook account as soon as he was told \nthat he would have to report it. He does not understand what he must report and \nwhen, and so he limits his internet use rather than risking making a mistake and \nputting himself in jeopardy of being prosecuted for noncompliance.  \nThe Stateโs Continued Enforcement of \nSORAโs Strict Liability Provisions \n \n166.   SORA imposes penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for violations of \nthe Act. M.C.L. ยงยง 28.729(1); 28.734(2); 28.735(2).  \n167.  Plaintiffs John Does #1-6 and the putative class members remain strictly \nliable for certain SORA violations, meaning that despite the absence of any inten-\ntion to violate the law, they will be held strictly liable for any failure to comply. \n168.  The plaintiffs fear that despite their best efforts to understand and comply \nwith the law, they will be held liable for unintentional violations of SORA, absent \nthe protections of the Does #1-5 decisions being extended to them. The putative \nclass members are in the same quandary. \n169.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 simply avoids certain activities due to the fear of \nprosecution for something that he may not have known. Mr. Doe #1โs daily life is \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.380   Filed 06/28/18   Page 36 of 47\nfairly routine because of his restrictions on the places that he can go. Mr. Doe #1 \nalso has been at his job for a number of years and does not want to risk losing it \nbecause of a mistake regarding SORAโs complex reporting requirements. \n170.  Plaintiff John Doe #2 always errs on the side of caution, in effect policing \nhimself because he does not want to risk prosecution for an inadvertent violation \nand lose everything that he has worked so hard to attain over the years.  \n171.  Plaintiff John Doe #3โs developmental disabilities make it difficult for him \nto comply with SORAโs complex reporting requirements. He fears that he will \ninadvertently fail to comply with SORA, despite his best efforts to do so. \n172.  Plaintiff John Doe #4 tries very hard to comply with SORA, but is often \nunclear about what his obligations are. If he does not know whether something is \nallowed, he simply does not do it. He fears that despite his best efforts he will \nviolate SORA.  \n173.  Plaintiff John Doe #5, too, always errs on the side of caution. Although he \nis compliant, he fears that a piece of paperwork or record may show that he is not \ncompliant based upon a mistake or something he didnโt know about, and that he \nwill be charged with a violation.  \n174.  Plaintiff John Doe #6 has a lot to lose because he and his family run a \nsuccessful restaurant business. Although he is the patriarch, his role in the business \nhas been severely limited because he is afraid that he will mistakenly do something \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.381   Filed 06/28/18   Page 37 of 47\nwrong and his error will come to the attention of law enforcement.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n175.  The plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all similarly \nsituated persons pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \n176.  The plaintiffs seek certification of a โprimary class,โ defined as people \nwho are or will be subject to registration under Michiganโs SORA. \n177.  The plaintiffs also seek certification of an โex post facto subclass,โ defined \nas members of the primary class who committed the offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before April 12, 2011.  \n178.  The proposed primary class and the proposed subclass both satisfy the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n179.  First, the class and subclass are each so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers of the class is impracticable.  \n180.  There are almost 44,000 persons subject to registration under SORA, and \nthe registry grows by about 2,000 additional people a year. All of these individuals \nare members of the primary class.  \n181.  There are tens of thousands of registrants who committed the offense(s) \nwhich subject them to registration before April 12, 2011, the effective date of the \n2011 SORA amendments. Those individuals are all members of the ex post facto \nsubclass (with the possible exception of a small number of people who have won \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.382   Filed 06/28/18   Page 38 of 47\nsome judicial relief through a separate action), and their joinder is impracticable. \n182.  Joinder is also impracticable because registrants are scattered all across the \nstate.  \n183.  Many registrants are indigent and would be unable to retain counsel to \nsecure their rights under Does I absent a class action. \n184.  The names and number of class members and subclass members are \nascertainable based on the defendantsโ records. \n185.  Proceeding under Rule 23 will promote the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this action because it will permit a large group of similarly-situated persons to \nprosecute their common claims simultaneously in a single forum, without dupli-\ncating evidence, and save the additional effort and expense that would otherwise be \nnecessary if their claims were brought through a series of individual actions.  \n186.  Already dozens of Michigan registrants have filed SORA cases in a variety \nof state and federal courts seeking to enforce Does I. Judicial economy will be \nserved by handling common issues related to the enforcement of Does I through \nclass-wide proceedings.  \n187.  Second, there are questions of law or fact common to the proposed primary \nclass and the proposed subclass. The common questions of law and fact include, \nbut are not limited to: \na.  Whether SORAโs prohibitions on working, residing, or โloiteringโ within \na โstudent safety zone,โ and SORAโs reporting requirements, are uncon-\n38 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.383   Filed 06/28/18   Page 39 of 47\nstitutionally vague, and therefore cannot be applied to registrants; \nb.  Whether SORAโs internet reporting requirements violate the First \nAmendment;  \nc.  Whether registrants can be held strictly liable for any violations of \nSORA; \nd.  Whether retroactively applying the 2006 and 2011 SORA amendments to \nregistrants whose offenses predate those amendments violates the Ex \nPost Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution; \ne.  Whether the 2011 SORA amendments are severable, and if not, whether \nSORA can be enforced against registrants whose offenses predate those \namendments. \n \n188.  Third, the claims asserted by plaintiffs John Does #1-6 are typical of the \nclaims of the class members whom they seek to represent. The same common \ncourse of conduct by the defendants gave rise to the plaintiffsโ and the class \nmembersโ claims. \n189.  Fourth, the plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nrespective class members. The plaintiffsโ interests are coincident with, and not \nantagonistic to, those of the respective class members.  \n190.  The plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel who are experienced \nin prosecuting civil rights and class action litigation and include the counsel who \nlitigated Does I, the class-wide enforcement of which is at issue in this case.  \n191.  The proposed classes also satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2) because the defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class members, warranting appropriate declaratory and injunctive \n39 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.384   Filed 06/28/18   Page 40 of 47\nrelief as to each class.  \nIncorporation of the Facts Set Forth Above \n192.  For all of the legal claims set forth below, the plaintiffs re-allege the facts \ndescribed in the paragraphs above and incorporate those facts by reference into the \nlegal claims. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I  \nViolations of the Due Process Clause: Vagueness  \n193.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states \nfrom enforcing laws that are unconstitutionally vague. As a matter of due process, \nstatutory requirements must be written with sufficient specificity that persons of \nordinary intelligence need not guess as to their meaning and will not differ as to \ntheir application. \n194.  For the reasons set out in this Courtโs decision in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 \nF. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. 2015), the following provisions of SORA are uncon-\nstitutionally vague, and therefore cannot be enforced under the Due Process \nClause:  \na.  the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733-734;  \nb.  the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733-734;  \nc.  the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, M.C.L. ยง \n28.733 & ยง 28.735;  \n40 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.385   Filed 06/28/18   Page 41 of 47\nd.  the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers ... routinely used \nby the individual, M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(h); \ne.  the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses ... routinely used by the individual, M.C.L. ยง \n28.727(1)(l); and \nf.  the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \n195.  The plaintiffs bring the due process vagueness claim for themselves and on \nbehalf of the primary class. \nCOUNT II \nViolations of the Due Process Clause: Strict Liability \n196.  The Due Process Clause limits the use of strict liability in the criminal law.  \n197.  This Court in Does #1-5, held that โ[a]mbiguity in the Act, combined with \nthe numerosity and length of the Actโs provisions make it difficult for a well-inten-\ntioned registrant to understand all of his or her obligations,โ and concluded that a \nknowledge requirement is necessary โto ensure due process of law.โ 101 F. Supp. \n3d at 693. \n198.  The plaintiffs bring the due process strict liability claim for themselves and \non behalf of the primary class. \nCOUNT III \nViolations of the First Amendment \n199.  The First Amendment prohibits abridgement of the freedom of speech. The \nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the First Amendment against the states. \n41 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.386   Filed 06/28/18   Page 42 of 47\n200.  For the reasons set out in this Courtโs decision in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 101 \nF. Supp. 3d 672 (E.D. Mich. 2015), and 101 F.Supp.3d 722 (E.D. Mich. 2015), the \nfollowing provisions of SORA violate the First Amendment: \na.  the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering authority ... \nimmediately after โฆ [t]he individual ... establishes any electronic mail or \ninstant message address, or any other designations used in internet com-\nmunications or postings,โ M.C.L. ยง 28.725(1)(f); and \nb.  the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registration requirementโs \nincorporation of the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses \nand instant message addresses assigned to the individual ... and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ M.C.L. ยง \n28.727(1)(i).  \n201. The plaintiffs bring the First Amendment claim for themselves and on \nbehalf of the primary class. \nCOUNT IV  \nViolation of the Ex Post Facto Clause \n \n202.  The retroactive application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments violates the \nEx Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Art. I, ยง 10, cl. 1, under the Sixth \nCircuitโs decision in Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016) (โDoes Iโ). \n203.  Under the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does I, the 2006 and 2011 SORA \namendments cannot be retroactively applied to plaintiffs John Does #1-5.  \n204.  The 2011 SORA amendments cannot be severed from SORA because the \nunconstitutional portions are so entangled with the other sections that they cannot \nbe removed without adversely affecting the operation of the act. As a result, there \n42 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.387   Filed 06/28/18   Page 43 of 47\nis no statute in effect that lawfully imposes restrictions and obligations based on \nconduct occurring before April 12, 2011. \n205.  The defendants are unlawfully requiring plaintiffs John Does #1-5 and \nmembers of the putative ex post facto subclass to register as sex offenders and to \ncomply with SORA, even though that statute is null and void as applied to them. \n206.  The plaintiffs bring the ex post facto claim for themselves and on behalf of \nthe ex post facto subclass. \nLack of a Legal Remedy \n207.  The plaintiffs and the putative class membersโ harm is ongoing, and cannot \nbe alleviated except by declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n208.  No other remedy is available at law to apply and enforce the Does I deci-\nsions to Michigan registrants going forward, and to ensure that constitutional con-\nduct is not barred outright or deterred by the risk of future prosecution. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  Wherefore, the plaintiffs, for themselves and for the putative class members \nwhom they wish to represent, ask the Court to grant the following relief: \nA. Rule that this action may be maintained as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and certify: \n \n1.  a โprimary class,โ defined as people who are or will be subject to regis-\ntration under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act, and name \nplaintiffs John Does #1-6 as representatives of the primary class; and \n2.  an โex post facto subclass,โ defined as members of the primary class who \n43 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 34, PageID.388   Filed 06/28/18   Page 44 of 47\ncommitted the offense or offenses requiring registration before April 12, \n2011, and name plaintiffs John Does #1-5 as representatives of the ex \npost facto subclass.  \nB.

Snyder, E.D. Mich. \nNo. 2:12-cv-11194, Order Granting Plaintiffsโ Motion to Proceed Anonymously, \nDoc #11 (4/18/12). Here, as there, although the plaintiffsโ personal information \nand status as sex offenders may already be available to the public as a result of \nbeing listed on the Michigan Sex Offender Registry, their association with this \nlawsuit, which challenges governmental action, is not known to the public.

The Court is satisfied that the plaintiffsโ privacy and safety interests \nsubstantially outweigh the presumption of open judicial proceedings. Moreover, \nallowing the plaintiffs to proceed anonymously will not materially impinge upon \nthe defendantsโ ability to defend against the lawsuit because the plaintiffs are \nwilling to disclose their names and other pertinent information to the defendantsโ \ncounsel upon request.  \nThe parties also stipulate to the entry of a protective order to enforce this \norder. Accordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the plaintiffs may proceed anonymously in this \naction. The parties have already submitted a stipulated protective order with \nrespect to the information the plaintiffs seek to protect, which the Court will \nreview separately. \nSO ORDERED. \n \n  S/Robert H.

The parties were in \nagreement that the initial deadlines outlined in the courtโs February 14, 2020 opinion \nand order are no longer feasible based on the currently strained administrative \nresources of law enforcement, significantly hobbled in responding to the pandemic.  \nUnder the existing circumstances, the parties agree that the court should defer \nentry of final judgment in this case and also agree that additional direction from the \ncourt is needed. However, the parties disagree as to the precise substance of that \ndirection.  \nFollowing a series of telephone organizational conferences with the court, each \nside has drafted and exchanged with opposing counsel a proposed interim order \naddressing how this case should proceed during the present state of emergency. As \n\n \ndiscussed during the telephone conference of March 26, 2020, the court will direct the \nparties to present their proposed orders as exhibits to concise memoranda (one \nmemorandum per side) in which the parties explain the basis for their position and offer \na critique of the proposed order of the opposing side. The attached proposed orders \nshould be clearly labeled as proposed orders. The court will review and carefully \nconsider these competing memoranda and will ultimately enter its own order providing \nfurther guidance in this case. Accordingly \n  IT IS ORDERED that each side FILE a memorandum on the docket, with a \nproposed order as an attachment, no later than the close of business on March 30, \n2020.   \ns/Robert H.

IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for declaratory relief (R. 62) is \nGRANTED. Michiganโs pre-2021 SORA is DECLARED to be punishment. Thus, \nthe ex post facto application of the 2006 and 2011 amendments is DECLARED \nunconstitutional, the 2011 amendments are DECLARED not severable from the pre-\n2021 SORA, and the pre-2021 SORA is therefore DECLARED NULL AND VOID \nas applied to conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021 to members of the ex post \nfacto subclasses (defined as all people who are or will be subject to registration under \nSORA, who committed their offense or offenses requiring registration prior to April \n12, 2011, and who have committed no registrable offense since).

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for injunctive relief (R. \n62) is GRANTED. Defendants and their agents are permanently ENJOINED from \nenforcing ANY provision in the pre-2021 SORA against members of the ex post \nfacto subclasses, for conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021. As the Legis-\nlature has now amended SORA, and as this litigation did not address the constitu-\ntionality of the new SORA (as defined above), this injunction does not enjoin \n3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 124, PageID.2539   Filed 08/04/21   Page 4 of 9\nenforcement of any provision in the new SORA (as defined above) against members \nof the ex post facto subclasses.  \n3.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for partial summary \njudgment (R. 75) is GRANTED. The following provisions of the pre-2021 SORA \nare DECLARED unconstitutional, and Defendants and their agents are perma-\nnently ENJOINED from enforcing them against any registrant for any violation \nthat occurred before March 24, 2021: \n(a)   Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \ni.   the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich.

Comp.  Laws \nยง 28.727(1)(i). \n \nAs this litigation did not address the constitutionality of the new SORA (as defined \nabove), this injunction does not enjoin enforcement of any provision in the new \nSORA (as defined above). \n4.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that enactment of the new SORA does not moot \nthis case. Absent this judgment, registrants could face prosecution for conduct that \noccurred before March 24, 2021, under provisions of the old SORA that have been \nfound unconstitutional, or whose enforcement was barred while the Interim Order, \nR. 91, was in effect.  \n5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 124, PageID.2541   Filed 08/04/21   Page 6 of 9\n5.

The \nInterim Order, R. 91, is hereby terminated.

See ECF #55, Order Granting Declara-\ntory Judgment and for 90-Day Deferral of Decision on Injunctive Relief \nto Provide Opportunity for Legislative Resolution.  The purpose of the \ndelay was to give the Legislature additional time to replace or to amend \nMichiganโs Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), Mich. Comp. Laws \nยง 28.721 et seq., in light of the Sixth Circuitโs decision in Does #1-5 v. \nSnyder, 834 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2016).  \n  The parties report that while a working group of state stake-\nholders has made significant progress on proposed new legislation, no \nreplacement or amended law has yet been introduced. Nonetheless, the \n90 days contemplated by this Courtโs May 23, 2019, order (ECF #55) \nhaving elapsed, and pursuant to the terms of that order, the Court now \norders as follows: \n1.  The parties shall file briefs addressing the central issues of \nthe case as framed by the parties, including, for example:  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 60, PageID.796   Filed 08/27/19   Page 3 of 4\n(a)  Whether the 2011 amendments can be severed from SORA, and \nwhether, if the 2011 amendments cannot be severed, the \nstatute is null and void as applied to people who are subject to \nregistration based on offenses committed before April 12, 2011;  \n \n(b)  What remedies shall be ordered in this case, and to which \nsubclasses those remedies should apply;  \n \n(c)  Whether there are issues of state law that should be certified to \nthe Michigan Supreme Court for decision, or whether this \nCourt should decide those issues.  \n \n2.  The parties need not brief the question listed in paragraph 2 \nof the May 23, 2019, order concerning whether the declaratory judgment \nand any subsequent injunctive relief shall apply to the class members \nlisted in that paragraph 2.  The parties have apprised the Court that \nthey wish to focus the current briefing on the questions listed above, and \ndefer briefing on who is covered by any relief this Court may order until \nafter the Court determines what relief is appropriate. \n3.  The partiesโ briefs shall be due as follows:  \n  Plaintiffsโ brief: 28 days from the date of entry of this order; \n \n  Defendantsโ response: 28 days from the filing of plaintiffsโ brief; \n \n  Plaintiffsโ reply: 21 days from the filing of defendantsโ response. \n \n4.

(ECF No. 84, PageID.31.)  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Interim Injunction takes effect \nIMMEDIATELY and applies to the primary class. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that during this interim period the parties will \nCONTINUE to prepare the form of a Final Judgment, notices, and a plan of when and \nhow the notices will be served. Counsel are expected to be prepared to submit the \njointly-proposed Final Judgment not later than 14 days after the current crisis ends. \nPursuant to the courtโs opinion and order of February 14, 2020, the Final Judgment \nshall take effect 60 days after the date it is entered.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within seven days of the entry of this order:  \n(a) The MSP and Plaintiffsโ counsel shall POST notice of this order, and a copy \n                                                           \n1 This interim injunction enjoins only enforcement. It does not bar the defendants \nfrom maintaining the registry, such as inputting information about new registrants or \ncontinuing the Public Sex Offender Registry. \n \n4 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 91, PageID.1851   Filed 04/06/20   Page 5 of 6\nof it or link to it, on their websites2 and/or such other locations as will with reasonable \nassurance allow it to be seen widely by class members;  \n(b) Whereas counsel for Defendants have identified the Prosecuting Attorneys \nCoordinating Counsel (PACC) as a suitable state agency for effective communication to \nindividual Prosecuting Attorneysโ offices, the Executive Director of PACC is DIRECTED \nFORTHWITH to provide effective notice of this order, and a copy of it or link to it, by \nemail to all Michigan Prosecuting Attorneys; \n(c) The MSP SOR Unit shall PROVIDE effective notice of this order, and a copy \nof it or link to it, by email to the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police and to the \nMichigan Sheriffsโ Association, who are expected to transmit the notice to all law \nenforcement personnel within those agencies who are responsible for SORA \nenforcement matters. \nFinally, IT IS ORDERED that parties REPORT to the court by joint memorandum \nor telephone conference, at their option, every 30 days on their progress in completing \nthe tasks set out above and in the Courtโs February 14, 2020, Opinion and Order, and \nany other matters pertinent to moving this case forward as expeditiously as reasonably \npossible in light of the current crisis. \ns/Robert H.

On \nFebruary 14, 2020, this court entered an opinion invalidating portions of Michiganโs \nSORA statute as a result of various constitutional violations. (ECF No. 84.) Due to the \nemerging Coronavirus pandemic (โCOVID-19โ), in April 2020 the court entered an \nโInterim Order Delaying Entry of Final Judgmentโ that preliminarily enjoined the \nreporting requirements of Michiganโs sex offender registry. (ECF No. 91.) Pending \nbefore the court are Plaintiffsโ two motions requesting the entry of a final judgment in the \ncase.1  (ECF Nos. 99, 107.) Defendants have also filed a competing motion requesting \nthe entry of an order โclarifyingโ and extending the interim injunction already in place. \n(ECF No. 113.) The motions have been fully briefed, and the court concludes that a \n \n1   Plaintiffs filed an amended motion requesting the entry of a final judgment in \nJanuary 2021 because parts of its original motion for judgment (ECF No. 99), were \nmooted by the passage of Michiganโs Public Act 295 (โnew SORAโ). \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2444   Filed 06/21/21   Page 2 of 23\nhearing is not necessary. See E.D. Mich. LR  7.1(f)(2). For the reasons explained \nbelow, the court will grant Plaintiffsโ motions, in part, and deny Defendantsโ motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural History \n  This case has a long and complex procedural history which the court \nsummarizes below. After a previous constitutional challenge to SORA resulted in parts \nof the statute being declared unconstitutional, Does #1-5 v. Snyder, 834 F.3d 696, 706 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (โDoes Iโ), Plaintiffs brought the present class action again challenging \nthe constitutionality of parts of the SORA statute. John Doe et al. v. Snyder, No. 16-\n13137 (E.D. Mich.) (โDoes IIโ). \nThe Does II second amended complaint contains four counts:  \n(1) a due process challenge based on vagueness to the following \nprovisions SORA: \n \n(a) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(b) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734; \n \n(c) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735; \n \n(d) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely \nused by the individual, Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(e) the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and \ninstant message addresses . . . routinely used by the individual,โ \nMich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(l); and  \n \n(f) the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, registration \nnumber, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel . . . \nregularly operated by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง \n2 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2445   Filed 06/21/21   Page 3 of 23\n28.727(1)(j). \n \n(2) a due process challenge based on SORAโs imposition of a strict liability \nscheme for violations of the act; \n \n(3) a First Amendment challenge based on:  \n   \n(a) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes \nany electronic mail or instant message address, or any other \ndesignations used in internet communications or postings,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.725(1)(f); and  \n \n(b) the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registrationโs \nrequirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses assigned to the individual . . . and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยง 28.727(1)(i); and  \n \n(4) an ex post facto challenge based on Defendantsโ continued \nenforcement of the 2006 and 2011 amendments.  \n \n(ECF No. 34, PageID.384-87.) \n   \n  The certified class in Does II includes three distinct classes. Plaintiffs \ndefine the primary class as all people who are or will be subject to registration \nunder SORA. The primary class seeks relief on Count I (vagueness); Count II \n(strict liability) and Count III (First Amendment). (EFC No. 46, PageID.693.) The \nsubclasses seek relief on Count IV (ex post facto) and are defined as follows: \n(1) The โpre-2006 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration before January 1, 2006, and who have committed no \nregisterable offense since.  \n \n(2) The โ2006-2011 ex post facto subclassโ is defined as members of the \nprimary class who committed their offense or offenses requiring \nregistration on or after January 1, 2006, but before April 12, 2011, and \nwho have committed no registerable offense since. \n3 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2446   Filed 06/21/21   Page 4 of 23\n(Id.) \n  On February 14, 2021, the court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for partial \nsummary judgment in Does II. (ECF No. 84.) The court first held that the 2011 \namendments to SORA constituted an ex-post-facto punishment that โcannot be \nsevered from the statuteโ so โSORA in toto cannot be applied to any members of \nthe ex post facto subclassesโ who were convicted before enactment of the 2011 \namendment. (Id., PageID.1797.) The court also found several other SORA \nprovisions were unconstitutional as to the primary classโsex-offenders who \nwere convicted after enactment of the 2011 amendment. (Id., PageID.1802.) \nSpecifically, the court held: \nConsistent with the courtโs reasoning and findings in Does I, the following \nprovisions for SORA will be declared unconstitutional as to all registrants: \n \n(a) Provisions Void for Vagueness: \n \n(1) the prohibition on working within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(2) the prohibition on loitering within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733โ734;  \n \n(3) the prohibition on residing within a student safety zone, Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยงยง 28.733, 28.735;  \n \n(4) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers  . . .  routinely \nused by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(5) the requirement to report โ[t]he license plate number, \nregistration number, and description of any motor vehicle, aircraft, \nor vessel . . . regularly operated by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. \nLaws. ยง 28.727(1)(j). \n \n     (b) Provisions Void for Strict Liability: \n  \n4 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2447   Filed 06/21/21   Page 5 of 23\n(1) under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, SORA \nmust be interpreted as incorporating a knowledge requirement. \n \n(c) Provisions Void under the First Amendment: \n \n(1) the requirement โto report in person and notify the registering \nauthority . . . immediately after . . . [t]he individual . . . establishes \nany electronic mail or instant message address, or any other \ndesignations used in internet communications or postings,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.725(1)(f);  \n \n(2) the requirement to report โ[a]ll telephone numbers . . . routinely \nused by the individual,โ Mich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(h);  \n \n(3) the requirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and \ninstant message addresses . . . routinely used by the individual, \nMich. Comp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(l); \n \n(4) the retroactive incorporation of the lifetime registrationโs \nrequirement to report โ[a]ll electronic mail addresses and instant \nmessage addresses assigned to the individual . . . and all login \nnames or other identifiers used by the individual when using any \nelectronic mail address or instant messaging system,โ Mich. \nComp. Laws. ยง 28.727(1)(i). \n(Id., PageID.1802-03.) And the court found that the Michigan State Police SOR Unit \nshould be required to provide โnotice of the relief granted in [the courtโs] order to all \nSORA registrants, law enforcement officials, and prosecuting attorneys.โ  (Id., \nPageID.1803-04.)  \nIn order to effectuate its decision, the court ordered โthat Plaintiffs submit a joint, \nproposed form of judgment encapsulating these rulings by March 13, 2020.โ (Id., \nPageID.1808.) The parties were unable to carry out this directive, however, before \nCOVID-19 shut down much of the state only a few weeks after the opinion was issued; \nmaking it โeffectively impossible [to enter] a final order providing complete relief.โ (ECF \nNo. 91, PageID.1847.) As a temporary solution to address the uncertainty created by \n5 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2448   Filed 06/21/21   Page 6 of 23\nthe courtโs ruling, in April 2020, the court entered an โInterim Order Delaying Entry of \nFinal Judgment, Preliminarily Enjoining Reporting Requirements, and Directing \nPublication.โ (ECF No. 91.) \nThe interim order suspended in-person reporting requirements for all sex \noffenders in the primary class during the state of emergency because the โCOVID-19 \npandemic makes in-person compliance with SORA effectively impossible.โ (Id., \nPageID.1849.) And it suspended โenforce[ment of] registration, verification, school \nzone, and fee violations of SORA that occurred or may occur from February 14, 2020, \nuntil the current crisis has ended, and thereafter until registrants are notified of what \nduties they have under SORA going forward.โ (Id., PageID.1850.) \nWhile the interim order remained in place, on December 31, 2020, the Michigan \nLegislature passed Public Act 295 (โnew SORAโ) which adopted numerous \namendments to Michiganโs SORA statute designed to address the constitutional \ninfirmities that this court found in the registry. (ECF No. 113, PageID.2294.) The new \nSORA became effective March 24, 2021, and all parties acknowledge that the new \nSORA removes or modifies all provisions that this court found to be unconstitutional in \nits February 14, 2021 opinion in Does II. (See Id., PageID.2295-99; ECF No. 107, \nPageID.2144.) While Plaintiffs comment that the new SORA also contains \nunconstitutional provisions and that โin some respects [the change] makes the law even \nmore punitive and unclear,โ they concede that challenges to the new version will need \nto be addressed in a subsequent and separate lawsuit, and contend that the court \nshould still enter a final judgment in this case. (ECF No. 107, PageID.2144-45.) \n6 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2449   Filed 06/21/21   Page 7 of 23\nDefendants, however, continue to argue that the court should not enter a final judgment \nin the case until a related lawsuit that is currently pending before the Michigan Supreme \nCourt is decided. (See ECF 110.) \nB. Related Michigan Supreme Court Case \nDefendantsโ briefs point to and rely upon an appeal in a criminal case now before \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 (Mich.). Betts involves a \ncriminal defendant who challenges his conviction of failing to register under SORA. \nDefendant/Appellant Betts was convicted in 1994 for the crime subjecting him to SORA \nregistration. (ECF No. 84, PageID.1784 n.2.) The Michigan Supreme Court granted \nleave to appeal and issued a briefing order directing the parties to address the following \nissues: \n(1) whether the requirements of the Sex Offenders Registration Act \n(SORA), MCL 28.721 et seq., taken as a whole, amount to โpunishmentโ \nfor purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Michigan and United \nStates Constitutions;  \n \n(2) if SORA, as a whole, constitutes punishment, whether it became \npunitive only upon the enactment of a certain provision or group of \nprovisions added after the initial version of SORA was enacted;  \n \n(3) if SORA only became punitive after a particular enactment, whether a \nresulting ex post facto violation would be remedied by applying the version \nof SORA in effect before it transformed into a punishment or whether a \ndifferent remedy applies;  \n \n(4) if one or more discrete provisions of SORA, or groups of provisions, \nare found to be ex post facto punishments, whether the remaining \nprovisions can be given effect retroactively without applying the ex post \nfacto provisions;  \n \n(5) what consequences would arise if the remaining provisions could not \nbe given retroactive effect; and  \n \n7 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2450   Filed 06/21/21   Page 8 of 23\n(6) whether the answers to these questions require the reversal of the \ndefendantโs conviction pursuant to MCL 28.729 for failure to register under \nSORA. \n \n(ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979โ80.) The Betts court has still not reached a decision \nin the case, and in February 2021, the state filed a supplemental brief. (See ECF \nNo. 110-1.) The brief requests that the court also decide if the new version of \nSORA, that became effective in March 2021, should be applied retroactively to \nthe conduct of registrants that occurred before the statuteโs enactment.  \nII. ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT  \nA. Mootness \nNow that the Legislature has amended Michiganโs sex offender registry to \nremove the provisions found unconstitutional in Does I and Does II, the parties first \ncontest whether the entry of a final judgment is necessary or if the case is now moot.  \nโ[A] case is moot, [when the court] lack[s] jurisdiction to proceed. Ramsek v. \nBeshear, 989 F.3d 494, 499 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Ohio v. EPA, 969 F.3d 306, 308 (6th \nCir. 2020) (โ[U]nder Article III, the โfederal courts are without power to decide questions \nthat cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.โโ)) (quotations omitted). \nโTo assess whether a case is moot, [the court must] ask โwhether the relief sought \nwould, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.โโ Id. (citing \nMcPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (en \nbanc)). \nThe parties essentially agree that the question of mootness turns on whether the \nnew SORA statute applies retroactively to conduct that occurred before the statuteโs \n8 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2451   Filed 06/21/21   Page 9 of 23\nenactment. To make their arguments, the parties rely on two separate principles of \nMichigan law that deal with the retroactive application of statutes after they are modified \nby the Legislature.  \nThe first principle is that changes to a statute, by default, operate prospectively. \nPeople v. Russo, 439 Mich. 584, 594, 487 N.W.2d 698, 702 (1992) (โThe general rule of \nstatutory construction in Michigan is that a new or amended statute applies \nprospectively unless the Legislature has expressly or impliedly indicated its intention to \ngive it retrospective effect.โ) Due to this prospective orientation, the legislature has \nenacted what is referred to as the โgeneral savings clauseโ which provides that โthe \nrepeal of any statute or part thereof shall not have the effect to release or relinquish any \npenalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute. . . unless the repealing act \nshall so expressly provide.โ Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. ยง 8.4a (emphasis added). For all \npractical purposes, this means that an individual can be held criminally liable for past \nviolations of a repealed/amended statute.2  \nThe second Michigan retroactivity doctrine at issue is the concept of \namelioration. The seminal Michigan case on the concept of amelioration is a plurality \nopinion in People v. Schultz, 435 Mich. 517, 520, 460 N.W.2d 505, 506 (1990). In \nSchultz, a defendant was convicted of possession of a large quantity of cocaine. Id. at \n \n2   Plaintiffsโ briefing succinctly summarizes how this โsavings clauseโ was enacted \nto prevent a situation where the modification of a statute would mean that a past \ncriminal violation would go unpunished because the enactment of the new statute \nrepealed an old statute but the new statute, for ex-post facto reasons, could not be \napplied retroactively. (See ECF No. 112, PageID.2248 (citing People v. Lowell, 230 \nN.W. 202, 203-04 (Mich. 1930).) \n9 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2452   Filed 06/21/21   Page 10 of 23\n507. And he was โsentenced to twenty to thirty years imprisonmentโ as the statute \nrequired โa mandatory twenty-year minimum term of imprisonment.โ Id. However, while \ndefendantโs conviction was on appeal, a new statute โreduced the mandatory minimum \nterm of imprisonment from twenty years to ten.โ Id. While the prosecution argued โthat \nboth the action to enforce criminal liability and the terms of punishment authorized in the \nstatutes prior to amendment remain in effect by operation of the general saving statute, \nM.C.L. ยง 8.4a,โ the Michigan Supreme Court held that section 8.4a โdoes indicate that \nconduct remains subject to punishmentโ but it โdoes notโ apply โwhere an amendatory \nact mitigates the authorized terms of punishment but continues to proscribe the same \nconduct.โ Id. at 509-10 (emphasis added).  \nThe ameliorative effect clearly applies when โa new, identical statuteโ is passed \nthat simply reduces the minimum sentence; however, the Michigan Court of Appeals \nhas found a legislative act that makes further modifications to a criminal statute cannot \nbe interpreted as to have retroactive effect without creating potential ex post facto \nconstitutional violations. See People v. Doxey, 263 Mich. App. 115, 120, 687 N.W.2d \n360, 363-64 (2004) (finding that the amelioration principle did not apply to a statute that \nโnot only amelioratively amended the sentencing provision of the statute, but also \nchanged the breakdown of the prohibited conduct contained in the statute, including the \naddition of a new crime of delivery of over 100 gramsโ)   \nApplying these principles, Defendants argue that the changes to SORA \nregulations contained in the new statute should โapply retroactively.โ (ECF No. 110, \nPageID.2174.) Defendants reason that โ[i]f the full measure of the reporting obligations \n10 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2453   Filed 06/21/21   Page 11 of 23\nand student safety zone restrictions under Michiganโs Sex Offenders Registration Act \nconstitute punishment, then the Legislatureโs act in reducing some of these dutiesโ\ne.g., allowing for a method of reporting other than in-person for certain minor changes \nand eliminating the student safety zones in totalโis ameliorative and operates \nretroactively for pending cases.โ (Id.) To support their theory, Defendants argue that \nwhile the โunrevised SORA constitute[d] [a] punishment,โ the โrevised SORA is now. . . \nfully regulatory and non-punitive so it can be applied retroactively without raising new \nex-post facto constitutional concerns.โ (Id., PageID.2180-82 (โ[T]he Legislature has \npruned [the] punitive elementsโ of the old SORA โleaving again a true regulatory \nschemeโ).) Defendants contend that registrants who violated provisions of the old \nSORA, which this court previously found unconstitutional, could not be prosecuted \ngoing forward for such violations due to the new SORAโs retroactive nature. And \nthereby has the case become moot. (Id., PageID.2185 (โโ[T]he [new SORA] irrevocably \neradicated the effects of the alleged [constitutional] violation,โ there is no controversy left \nfor the court to decideโ).) \nPlaintiffs reject this analysis. They contend that โ[u]nder clear state statutory and \ncase law, criminal liability is governed by the law in effect when the offense occurs. \nMoreover, the โameliorationโ doctrine does not apply because the punishment for SORA \nviolations is unchanged, and because any โameliorationโ in SORA 2021 goes to \npunishment for the underlying sex offense, not for alleged violations of SORA itself.โ \n(ECF No. 112, PageID.2253-54.) Plaintiffs contend that the present case โis not moot \nbecause anyone who committed a SORA compliance offense before March 24, 2021 \n11 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2454   Filed 06/21/21   Page 12 of 23\ncan still be prosecuted under the old SORA, and will remain liable until [Michiganโs] six-\nyear statute of limitations runs.โ (Id., PageID.2254.) Therefore, it argues that the entry of \na final judgment is required to prevent such prosecutions going forward. \nAfter review of the relevant case law, the court is inclined to adopt Plaintiffsโ \nmuch simpler approach. First, it is undisputed that Public Act 295 of 2020, which \nenacted the new version of SORA, does not expressly state that it should be applied \nretroactively, so the court is left to glean any such intent from the nature of the statutory \nprovisions. See Schultz, 460 N.W.2d at 512. While Defendants present an interesting \nargument for why the court should consider the new SORA to be only an ameliorative \nregulatory statute, at the same time they argue that the statute eliminates provisions of \nthe sex-offender registry the court has already found to be unconstitutional under the \nex-post facto clause. (See ECF No. 110, PageID.2182 (โ[T]he unrevised SORA is a \nregulatory scheme with some elements that have made it [a criminal] punitive [law]. . . \nthe Legislature has pruned those punitive elements. . . leaving again a true regulatory \nschemeโ).) By Defendantsโ own admission, this would be a novel application of the \nconcept of amelioration under Michigan law. (See id.) Michigan law does not allow \nDefendants to have it both ways.  \nPut simply, the present situation is much closer to Doxey then Schultz. The new \nSORA is not โa new, identical statuteโ that merely changes the punishment for a specific \noffense, see Doxey, 687 N.W.2d at 363, instead it eliminated entire provisions, like the \nschool safety zone requirement that the court found to be criminal in nature. \nFurthermore, just as in Doxey, Defendantsโ interpretation would raise new ex post facto \n12 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2455   Filed 06/21/21   Page 13 of 23\nconcerns because the new SORA also modified at least some reporting requirements. \nSee id. at 364. (See ECF No. 112, PageID.2256 (citing M.C.L. ยง 28.727(1)(h); ยง \n28.722(g)) (highlighting that the new SORA broadens what telephone numbers and \ninternet identifiers must be reported by registrants).) Michigan precedent finds thatโ\nabsent an express declaration of retroactive intent by the Legislatureโwhen one \ninterpretation raises significant ex post facto concerns, the court should hew to an \ninterpretation that does not raise such concerns. Id. Consequently, the court concludes \nthat the new version of SORA applies only to registrantsโ conduct on or after March 24, \n2021.  \nB. Preclusive Effects of the Final Judgment \nIn the alternative, Defendants argue that the court should not rule on the new \nSORAโs retroactivityโor should at least hold off on such a rulingโbecause the \nMichigan Supreme Court could decide the same issue. People v. Betts, No. 14-8981 \n(Mich.) (ECF No. 110, PageID.2188-92.) The court is not convinced, as a matter of law \nor as a practical matter, that further delay is justified.   \nThe retroactive application of the new SORA statute was not among the six \nquestions the Supreme Court stated it would consider when, in June 2019, it granted \nleave to appeal in the Betts case. (ECF No. 66-2, PageID.979-80.) Defendants, \nhowever, did raise the issue in a supplemental brief it filed in Betts in February 2021, so \nthe Court could potentially weigh in. (See ECF No. 110-1.) \nThis courtโs previous ruling on the question of certification, involving a slightly \ndifferent retroactivity question, in its February 2020 opinion rejects many of the same \n13 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2456   Filed 06/21/21   Page 14 of 23\narguments that Defendants now raise. (See No. 84.) As the court pointed out, โthe \nissues in Betts are not identical to the remaining questions of law in this case.โ (Id., \nPageID.1791.) And the Betts court may not even decide all the questions before it in \nBetts. (See id.) This court does not view the application of either Section 8.4a or the \nstateโs amelioration doctrine to be an unsettled area of Michigan law, even if \nDefendantsโ own arguments on the topic appear novel. So, there is no unsettled \nquestion of law that alone justifies continued delay in the resolution of a case that has \nalready resulted in over nine years of combined litigation. Furthermore, it is important to \nremember that Michigan Supreme Court is under no obligation to hear the case at all. In \nlight of this courtโs February 2020 ruling and enactment of the new SORA, it is possible \nthat the Court could now simply vacate its order, reject the appeal, and reach no \ndecision on the matter. \nFrom a practical perspective, a Michigan Supreme Court ruling on whether the \nnew SORA can be applied retroactively is unlikely to have any impact if issued after this \ncourt enters a final judgment. If the Betts court reaches the question of retroactivity and \nconcurs in this courtโs holdingโthat the new version of SORA should not be applied \nretroactively to conduct that occurred before March 24, 2021โthen nothing changes \nbecause this court has already found the disputed provisions of the old SORA statute to \nbe unconstitutional on Federal grounds. If the Betts court reaches the question and \nconcludes the oppositeโholding that the new SORA applied retroactively and \nameliorated SORAโs old, unconstitutional provisionsโthen Defendants still cannot be \ncharged for violations of the disputed provisions of the old SORA. (See ECF No. 110, \n14 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2457   Filed 06/21/21   Page 15 of 23\nPageID.2181 (Defendants charting the โtiming of offenseโ and the โapplicable version of \nSORAโ).) So, as a practical matter, nothing would change for the class members.3 If, on \nthe other hand, this court waited for the Michigan Supreme Court to issue a ruling, the \nclass members could be left with the current confusion while awaiting a Michigan \nSupreme Court decision that may never come. For all these reasons, the court \nconcludes that a further delay in the entry of a final judgment is inappropriate. \nIII. CONTENTS OF FINAL JUDGMENT  \nThe parties also continue to disagree on the contents of the final judgment. The \nissues have been fully briefed, and the court will now address the most pressing \ndisputes.4 \nA. Incorporation of the Interim Order \nThe partiesโ positions regarding the incorporation of the interim orderโwhereby \nthe court suspended the entry of only the final judgmentโhave evolved over multiple \nrounds of briefing. Plaintiffs initially proposed that the text of the final judgment should \ncontain a paragraph โincorporat[ing] this Courtโs interim order barring enforcement of \nregistration, verification, school zone, and fee violations of [old] SORA that occurred \n[after] February 14, 2020.โ (ECF No. 99, PageID.1891.) The Plaintiffs contended that \nincorporation would serve two purposes, (1) it would clarify โthat the final order \n \n3   As this court has previously noted, if the Michigan Supreme Courtsโ ruling โruns \nsomehow contrary to this courtโs determination, this court can modify its judgment to \nconform to Bettsโ though Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). (ECF No. 84, \nPageID.1792 n.6.) \n4   Given the partiesโ joint representations in a recent telephonic status conference, \nthe court is confident that the parties can work together to resolve any remaining issues \nregarding the contents of the final judgment not directly addressed by this opinion.  \n15 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2458   Filed 06/21/21   Page 16 of 23\nsupersedes the interim order,โ and (2) the proposed language would require that \nregistrants could not be prosecuted for any violations of SORA until โthey received \nnoticeโ of the courtโs ruling. (Id.) \nFollowing the enactment of the new SORA, which became effective on March 24, \n2021, Plaintiffs concede that the interim order does not prevent the enforcement of the \nnew SORA statute effective March 24, 2021. (See ECF No. 115, PageID.2328.) And \nthey concede that COVID-19 no longer impedes registrantsโ ability to โfulfill their SORA \nduties.โ (Id., PageID.2334.) Plaintiffs now propose that the final judgment should include \nlanguage expressly incorporating the courtโs interim order to ensure that registrants will \nnot be prosecuted for violations that occurred while the interim order was in effect. (Id., \nPageID.2338-39.) \n  Defendants agree that the registrants should be informed that the interim order \nโhas no bearing on the amended SORAโ and therefore โdoes not impinge on the ability \nof the State Defendants to enforce the 2021 SORA for conduct that occurs on or after \nMarch 24, 2021.โ (ECF No. 117, PageID.2352.) Defendants opposed the entry of final \njudgmentโas discussed at length in Section IIโ so they propose that the court should \ninstead amend the existing interim order to โclarify that the April 6, 2020 interim \ninjunction does not bar the State Defendants from enforcing the [new] SORA.โ (ECF No. \n113, PageID.2288.)  \n  Because the court has already decided to enter a final judgment, it finds no need \nfor a separate order โclarifyingโ the interim order. Further, the court finds that the \nexpress incorporation of the interim order into the final judgment will simplify the \n16 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2459   Filed 06/21/21   Page 17 of 23\nsituation going forward for both registrants and law enforcement. The final order will \nprovide a single document defining what violations of the old SORA can be prosecuted \nin the future. Such finality is clearly needed as it appears some registrants and law \nenforcement agencies apparently do not understand the full effect of the interim order. \n(See, e.g., ECF Nos. 112-2, 112-3, 112-4, PageID.2274-82 (Attorneys Mannikko, Ryan, \nand White attesting that some law enforcement agencies have continued to charge \nregistrants for SORA violations that occurred in 2020 while the interim order was in \neffect).)   \nB. Disclosure of Class Information \nDue to the extraordinary procedural posture of this class action, no complete \nclass list has ever been provided to Plaintiffsโ counsel. (ECF No. 99, PageID.1892.) \nBoth sides agree that a class list should be provided, but a dispute remains over what \nshould be included. (ECF No. 107, PageID.2151.) Plaintiffs argue that in order to fulfill \ntheir duties as class counsel, they should be given complete personal information for all \nclass membersโregardless of whether the individual is listed in Michiganโs publicly \naccessible sex offender databaseโand class counsel additionally requests they be \nprovided contact information (phone number and primary email address) for all class \nmembers even though such information is not contained in the publicly accessible \ndatabase. (See ECF No. 99, PageID.1865-96; ECF No. 103, PageID.2083.) Class \ncounsel argues that access to this information is needed so they can efficiently respond \nto the inevitable flood of inquiries from individual class members regarding their \nregistration status after the final judgment is entered. (Id.) \n17 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2460   Filed 06/21/21   Page 18 of 23\nDefendants argue, however, that the confidentiality requirements in Michigan \nstatute prevent them from providing such a complete list. (ECF No. 101, PageID.1947-\n55.) While Defendants have agreed to provide addressees, basic demographic and \noffense information contained in Michiganโs public sex offender registry (PSOR), \nDefendants argue they โare not authorized to disclose information regarding non-public \noffenders, i.e., any offender or offender information not authorized for disclosure in the \nPSOR under [Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.728(2)].โ (Id., PageID.1950.) These include \nโindividuals registered solely because they were subject to an order in a juvenile matter \nin another state or country.โ (Id. (citing Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.728(4)).) Further, \nDefendants contend that they are barred from disclosing phone numbers and primary \nemail address for all class members, even those listed in the PSOR because โ[n]on-\npublic information in the law enforcement database is confidential and is not open to \ninspection except for law enforcement purposes.โ (Id., PageID.1951 (citing Mich. Comp. \nLaws ยง 28.730).) Defendants also cite โthe Criminal Justice Information Systems Policy \nCouncil Actโ and argue this statute bars such a disclosure by government officials. (Id. \n(citing Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214).) \nIn response, Plaintiffs argue that the โ[t]he statutes [Defendants] rely upon. . . \nprovide no succor for [Defendants] claimโ that โthey are legally barred from providing \nany non-public information.โ (ECF No. 103, PageID.2084.) In support of their view, \nPlaintiffs rely on Dupuie-Jarbo v. Twenty-Eighth Dist. Ct., a previous decision by this \ncourt interpreting MCL ยง 28.214, and People v. Malkowski, a Michigan Supreme Court \nruling, which found that another Michigan statuteโs confidentiality provision allowed the \n18 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2461   Filed 06/21/21   Page 19 of 23\ndisclosure of presentence reports to defense counsel. (Id., PageID.2084-85 (citing No. \n10-10548, 2010 WL 2813343, at *2 (E.D. Mich. July 14, 2010) (Cleland, J.); 188 N.W.2d \n559, 560 n.1 (Mich. 1971).)  \nThe court finds that Plaintiffsโ view more accurately reflects Michiganโs law \ngoverning such disclosures. Because the court finds that the statutes cited by \nDefendants do not bar the court from requiring such a disclosure to class counsel, \nDefendants must provide information on class members not in the PSOR database and \nadditional contact information for all class members.5  \nFirst, the Sixth Circuit has held that โ[t]he Federal Rules expressly authorize \ndiscovery โ[i]n aid of [a] judgmentโโ including โbroad. . . postjudgment discoveryโ to \nmonitor โcompliance with the court's judgment and award of injunctive relief.โ See \nUnited States v. Conces, 507 F.3d 1028, 1039-40 (6th Cir. 2007). So, as a general \nmatter, this court has authority to require that Defendants produce information narrowly \ntailored to the enforcement of its judgment. See id. The court finds that a limited \ndisclosure of personal information identifying class members is necessary to ensure that \nthe courtโs award of injunctive relief is properly enforced for all members of the certified \nclass.   \nIn Dupue-Jarbo this court considered a Michigan District Courtโs argument that it \nshould not have to disclose information โfrom criminal justice information systemsโ as \npart of a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against it in federal court โbecause it would \n \n5   The parties should include a deadline by which Defendants must turn over a \ncomplete class list within the proposed final judgment. \n19 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2462   Filed 06/21/21   Page 20 of 23\nbe a state crime to produceโ the information under Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214. 2010 \nWL 2813343, at *2. This court flatly rejected such an interpretation of the statute. Id. \nBecause the disclosure of such information was relevant to ongoing discovery under the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court found that โDefendantsโ production of the \ncriminal history reports would be โauthorized by . . . ruleโ and it would not be a crime \nunder Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214 [(5)] for Defendants to produce them.โ Id. This \ninterpretation informs the present dispute. Since the court has authority toโand will \nrequireโthe disclosure of such requested class information through its post-judgment \nauthority under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the disclosure cannot be \nconsidered a criminal violation of Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.214. \nThe closer question is whether the SORA statute itself allows the disclosure of \nthe requested information. SORA provides that โa registration or report is confidential \nand information from that registration or report shall not be open to inspection except for \nlaw enforcement purposes. . . all included materials and information are exempt from \ndisclosure under. . . the freedom of information act.โ Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.730. The \nstatute also states that โ[e]xcept as provided in this act, an individual other than the \nregistrant who knows of a registration or report under this act and who divulges, uses, \nor publishes nonpublic information concerning the registration or report in violation of \nthis act is guilty of a misdemeanor.โ Id. The statute does not explicitly contemplate the \ndisclosure of a registrantโs information to his own attorney.  \nPlaintiffs correctly observe that the Michigan Supreme court has dealt with an \nanalogous question before in Malkowski. 385 Mich. 244, 246, 188 N.W.2d 559, 560 \n20 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2463   Filed 06/21/21   Page 21 of 23\n(1971). The Malkowski court noted that the language of the then-applicable statute \ngoverning the disclosure of presentence reports โprovide[ed] that reports of \ninvestigations by probation officers are declared to be privileged or confidential \ncommunications not open to public inspection.โ Id. at 560 n.1 (quotation omitted). \nBecause the statute stated that its intent was to protect โthe relation of confidence \nbetween the probation officer and probationer or defendant under investigation,โ the \ncourt held that โ[i]n view of the legislative intent, this provision should not be construed \nto deny access by either a defendant or his attorney to presentence reports.โ Id. \nTherefore, the court found that the state was also required to provide attorneys access \nto the presentence reports. Id. \nThe general rule that can be drawn from Malkowski is that, absent explicit \nlanguage to the contrary, the court should presume that reports available to an \nindividual directly can also be provided to his counsel even when the public at large is \nbarred from accessing such information. See id. When viewed in toto, one of the \npurposes of Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 28.730 is the protection of a registrantโs privacy. The \ncourt simply does not believe that Defendantsโ reading of the statute in the present \ncaseโwhich would bar the disclosure of any non-public registration information to a \nregistrantโs counselโconforms with a statute which plainly contemplates registrants \nhaving access to the information for their own purposes.6  \n \n6 To be sure, the disclosure of class list information to class counsel can sometimes \nraise unique privacy concerns, especially at the pre-certification stage. See, e.g., Martin \nv. Sysco Corp., No. 116CV00990DADSAB, 2017 WL 4517819, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. \n10, 2017) (limiting the scope of disclosures to class counsel at the pre-certification stage \nto protect to preserve class memberโs privacy). Such concerns are reduced after a class \n21 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2464   Filed 06/21/21   Page 22 of 23\nTo summarize, the court finds that neither of the statutes cited by Defendants \nactually prevent them from disclosing to class counsel non-public registrant information \nfor registrants who are already members of the certified class. While Defendants are \nfree to put reasonable conditions on any disclosures to ensure that the information is \nnot inadvertently released to others or used for any purpose other than the assistance \nof class members, the final order will require Defendants to provide the identifying \ninformation that Plaintiffs request. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor over nine years, the parties have been engaged in litigation over the \nunconstitutional provisions of Michiganโs sex offender registry. It is past time for this \nlitigation to come to an end. The court has determined that the possibility of future \nprosecutions for violations of the old SORA statute require the entry of a final judgment \neven though the judgment will not affect the enforcement of the new SORA statute \nenacted in March of 2021. And, the court has determined that the best, and most \nefficient, course is for a final judgment to be entered in the present litigation. The court \nalso finds that it is appropriate to include the interim order in the final judgment for the \nsake of clarity and that Defendants must provide Plaintiffs with a complete class list for \nthe purpose of post-judgment monitoring. Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ โMotion for Judgmentโ (ECF No. 99) is \nGRANTED IN PART. \n \nhas already been certified. And, in any event, Defendantsโ argument against disclosure \ndoes not raise this issue.  \n22 \n   \n\n \nCase 2:16-cv-13137-RHC-DRG   ECF No. 121, PageID.2465   Filed 06/21/21   Page 23 of 23\nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ โAmended Motion for Judgmentโ (ECF No. 107) is \nGRANTED IN PART. \nIT IS ORDERED that Defendantsโ โMotion to Clarify Injunctionโ (ECF No. 107) is \nDENIED.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties in the next 21 days must meet and \nconfer on the contents of the final judgment. Plaintiffs must submit a joint, proposed \nform of judgment encapsulating these rulings by July 12, 2021. \n \ns/Robert H. Cleland                          / \nROBERT H.
