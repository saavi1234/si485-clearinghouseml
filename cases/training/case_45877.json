    "summary": "<p>On February 16, 2018, a prisoner housed in solitary confinement in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) at the Polunsky Unit within the Texas Department of Criminal Justice filed a pro se lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas challenging the conditions of his confinement. The plaintiff filed suit against the prison&rsquo;s Senior Warden, Major of Correctional Officers, Deputy Director of Support Operations, and Assistant Director of Classification, as well as three members of the prison&rsquo;s State Classification Committee, alleging that the defendants subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment, inhumane living conditions, denial of due process, retaliation, and denial of mental health treatment. The complaint included a procedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, a retaliation claim under the First Amendment, and an Eighth Amendment claim alleging the conditions, including the duration, of his solitary confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiff requested injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Marcia A. Crone.</p>\r\n<p>In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he had been continuously held in solitary confinement for 23 years following a 1994 prison escape despite having long since had his &ldquo;escape risk&rdquo; designation removed. He complained of 23-24 hour daily confinement, unsanitary food service, smaller food portions, consistent strip searches, limited ability to possess property, and denial of human contact and television access. He further alleged excessive noise, chemical agent exposure, harsh lockdown conditions, restricted legal access, retaliatory cell moves to unsanitary and unlit cells, and lack of medical privacy. The plaintiff alleged that review hearings to assess his continued confinement in the SHU were sham hearings. Finally, he alleged he had suffered retaliation for filing grievances, including the confiscation of his typewriter.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on March 6, 2019, asserting that the plaintiff had failed to adequately allege constitutional violations and failed to demonstrate the defendants&rsquo; personal involvement in his alleged mistreatment. The defendants further asserted that claims for monetary damages were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that the plaintiff lacked standing for injunctive relief. The matter was referred to Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn, who issued his report and recommendation on March 9. In his report, the magistrate recommended that the complaint be dismissed for lack of Article III standing because the defendants lacked the ability to release him from the SHU even with a favorable decision. The magistrate then proceeded to analyze the merits of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims and recommended that they be dismissed with prejudice. 2020 WL 4724315. Over the plaintiff&rsquo;s objections, Judge Crone formally accepted the magistrate&rsquo;s report and recommendations on May 5, 2020. 2020 WL 2186246.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in June 2020 where the case was assigned to a three-judge panel comprised of Circuit Justices Carolyn Dineen King, Jerry Edwin Smith, and Catharina Haynes. At this stage, the plaintiff retained counsel, now proceeding with representation by attorneys from the MacArthur Justice Center. Oral argument in the appeal occurred on April 1, 2021, and the panel issued an opinion on June 18, 2021. The court affirmed the lower court in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings. 861 Fed.Appx. 571. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff did have standing to bring his official-capacity claims and that, pursuant to the <em>Ex parte Young</em> exception, state sovereign immunity did not bar the plaintiff&rsquo;s official-capacity claims for prospective injunctive relief. Next, the court noted that the plaintiff brought not only official-capacity claims, but also sought damages against the defendants in their official capacity. However, neither the magistrate nor the district judge considered these claims. Accordingly, the court remanded the plaintiff&rsquo;s individual-capacity claims for consideration in the first instance. Lastly, the court reviewed the dismissal of the particular official-capacity claims for failure to state a claim. The court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of the plaintiff&rsquo;s procedural due process claim and, as to all defendants other than the prison major, the plaintiff&rsquo;s Eighth Amendment claim. However, the court vacated the dismissal of the retaliation claim and, as to the prison major only, the Eighth Amendment claim. The court remanded those matters for further proceeding along with the individual-capacity claims.</p>\r\n<p>Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in January 2022. The petition was distributed for conference in March and June of 2022, as well as in April 2023. However, on April 17, 2023, the Court officially denied the petition. 143 S.Ct. 1746.</p>\r\n<p>With the case back in the district court, the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Specifically, the plaintiff sought to add additional factual support for his individual-capacity claims. However, he also sought to allege an additional &sect; 1983 conspiracy claim and add an excessive force claim against two additional defendants. The motion was referred to Magistrate Judge Hawthorn, who recommended on May 30, 2024, that the motion be denied without prejudice to the plaintiff&rsquo;s ability to file a new motion for leave to amend strictly limited to supporting the claims remanded to the district court. 2024 WL 4223194. The district court formally adopted the magistrate&rsquo;s recommendation on September 16, 2024, noting that allowing the plaintiff to add new claims at this stage would violate the remand rule. The plaintiff submitted a new motion for leave to amend in October 2024.</p>\r\n<p>As of March 2025, the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion remains pending before the district court.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Fifth Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded in June 2021. The court held that the plaintiff did have standing for his official-capacity claims, affirmed the dismissal of the due process claim and the Eighth Amendment as to all but one defendant. However, the court vacated the dismissal of the retaliation claim and the Eighth Amendment as to the remaining defendant. The court also remanded individual-capacity claims for consideration, as the district court failed to consider these claims prior to dismissal. 861 Fed.Appx. 571.

Plaintiff claims\nhe has been held in Administrative Segregation continuously for the last twenty-three years and has\nbeen told he cannot be transferred from this environment because he has an escape on his record. \nPlaintiff complains he is confined to his cell for twenty-three hours per day for 191 days a year and\ntwenty-four hours per day on the remaining 174 days of the year.  However, plaintiff later states he\nis allowed out of his cell two hours per day for recreation five days per week.\nPlaintiff claims he is fed in his cell through a tray slot opening in the cell door and is fed on\nunsanitary food trays and, as a result, he claims he has suffered incidents of food poisoning. \nAdditionally, plaintiff complains that the meals are cold even though they are delivered in a โHot\nCart.โ  Plaintiff alleges the food portions given to inmates in Administrative Segregation are smaller\nthan the portions given to inmates and General Population, and they are not provided many of the\ncondiments provided to General Population inmates such as mustard and syrup.\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 2 of 16 PageID #:  158\nNext, plaintiff complains he is required to submit to a strip search prior to being removed \nfrom his cell for any reason.  He claims he is strip searched, on average, four times per day.  Plaintiff \nstates he is required to squat down to place his hands through the tray slot to be hand-cuffed, \nstraining his shoulders and rotator cuffs.  However, according to plaintiff, defendants Harris, the unit \nwarden, and Rehse, the unit major, refuse to allow him to be handcuffed in the front of his body. \nPlaintiff claims the defendants are deliberately indifferent to his medical needs.\nPlaintiff also complains he is limited in the amount and kind of property he can possess in \nthe SHU.  He claims this reduces the amount of reading material and other personal items he may \npossess, and the amount of property is smaller than inmates in General Population are allowed. \nPlaintiff complains he cannot possess a razor, pencil sharpener or clothing that has elastic in it.\nNext, plaintiff complains that due to being housed alone in his administrative segregation \ncell, he is denied almost all human contact, and his only human contact is with officers and medical \nstaff.  Plaintiff claims he is denied contact visitation with his family and has to visit through a \nplexiglass partition and talk over a phone.\nPlaintiff claims he also is denied access to a television, and is only permitted to use a \ntelephone in an emergency situation after approval by unit administration.  Plaintiff complains \nhe is only permitted to call persons on his approved visitor list which consists of ten people \ninstead of the twenty people allowed for prisoners in General Population.\nPlaintiff complains that his housing area is loud all hours of the day due to both inmates and \nofficers.  Plaintiff claims this deprives him of โquality sleep and only allows him to sleep fitfully \nseveral hours at a time.โ  Plaintiff claims this adds to his anxiety and depression.  \nPlaintiff claims he has been indirectly exposed to the use of chemical agents at least ten times \nin the last two years through no fault of his own.  Plaintiff claims prison officials are aggressive and \ncareless with their use of chemical agents and use them in excessive amounts in unwarranted \nsituations with no regard to the other prisoners they expose to these gases.  \n2\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 3 of 16 PageID #:  159\nNext, plaintiff complains the SHU is locked down a minimum of four times a year compared\nto two lock-downs per year in General Population.  In addition to the lock-downs, plaintiff claims\ncells are randomly searched and inspected every other day.  While on lock-down, plaintiff complains\nthat he is given a โJohnnyโ consisting of two sandwiches in a sack for each meal, and one of the\nsandwiches is peanut butter.  Plaintiff complains the sack lunches have less calories than the food\nserved on trays and has subjected him to weight loss and constipation.  Plaintiff claims that during\nthe lock-downs the walkways are not mopped and showers are not cleaned.  As a result, plaintiff\nclaims the showers have mold and mildew on the walls.  \nPlaintiff also complains his access to legal materials is reduced due to his housing location. \nAs a result, plaintiff claims research takes him longer than if he were allowed to go to the law library.\nAdditionally, plaintiff claims he is denied access to other prisoners knowledgeable in the law.\nNext, plaintiff claims that following an incident in 2012 in which a ten inch screwdriver was\nfound in his cell or property, he has been moved to a different cell each week to harass him and\nretaliate against him.  Plaintiff claims both Warden Harris and Major Rehse order his weekly moves\nas a form of harassment and without penological reason.\nPlaintiff claims that when he moves into a new cell it is not disinfected or otherwise cleaned,\nand he is not provided with cleaning supplies.  On some occasions, plaintiff claims he was moved\ninto a cell with no lights.  On December 21, 2017, plaintiff claims he was moved into a cell with\nmold on the back wall and floor.  He claims he remained in that cell for thirteen days and began\ncoughing.  Plaintiff claims that it took outside advocates contacting the warden to get him moved\nfrom the cell.  Plaintiff claims defendant Rehse saw the mold on the back wall of his cell on\nDecember 26, 2017, but it was only after Assistant Warden Jefferson sent someone to inspect the\ncell and saw the mold growth that she ordered him removed from the cell. \nPlaintiff complains that, due to his housing classification requiring an escort everywhere he\ngoes, he has no privacy when consulting with medical or mental health professionals.  Plaintiff\nclaims the lack of escort officers is not uncommon resulting in delayed or cancelled appointments\n3\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 4 of 16 PageID #:  160\nand medical or mental health personnel frequently making cell-side visits where other prisoners can\nlisten.  Plaintiff also claims he has reported to mental health professionals that he deals with bouts\nof anxiety, depression, and visual and auditory hallucinations but he has been denied treatment for\nthese conditions.  \nPlaintiff states the Administrative Segregation Committee conducts a hearing concerning his\nconfinement at thirty-day intervals, but he is not allowed to attend.  Plaintiff complains that the\ncommittee has no authority to release him and the reviews are a sham and meaningless because the\nState Classification Committee has already decided he will remain in the SHU for the next 180 days. \nPlaintiff states he is reviewed by the State Classification Committee every 180 days to determine\nwhether he will remain in the SHU or be released to general population.   \nOn June 24, 2016, plaintiff claims he was reviewed by SCC member Melissa Benet.  Plaintiff\nmade both an oral and written statement at the hearing.  After she looked over his file, plaintiff\nclaims Benet told him she saw no reason not to release him to a transitional program.  However, he\nlater received his hearing record in the mail, and it indicated he was to remain in the SHU without\nfurther explanation.  At a subsequent hearing on December 3, 2016, plaintiff claims he asked Benet\nwhy he was not released to the transitional program like she told him in June of 2016.  Plaintiff states\nBenet told him โyou are high profile, I donโt have the authority to release you.โ  Thus, plaintiff\nclaims Benetโs review was perfunctory and a sham used to provide him due process.  Plaintiff claims\nhe saw another SCC member, Ms. Enlow, on June 8, 2017 and when he requested release he was\ninformed โthatโs not my decision.โ  Plaintiff claims he was later reviewed by SCC member defendant\nBonnie Fiveash.  Plaintiff claims Fiveash told him โyouโre still in good shape I canโt release you.โ \nWhen asked if it was ever her call to make, plaintiff claims Fiveash told him โthat would be the\nDirectorโs call.โ  Plaintiff complains that he has not been told what he must do to be released to\nGeneral Population.  Plaintiff claims defendant Eschessa, the Deputy Director of Operations has the\ncapacity to release him to General Population, but Eschessa would not review his file.  Plaintiff also\nclaims defendant White, Assistant Director of Classifications, was contacted by outside advocates\n4\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 5 of 16 PageID #:  161\nand stated she would not allow his release or make recommendations for his release.  White stated\nthat because plaintiff escaped in 1994 she does not want the responsibility that goes along with\nmaking that decision.  Plaintiff claims White has instructed all SCC members that plaintiff is to\nremain in the SHU.  \nPlaintiff claims that in December, 2005, the Security Precautions Designator Committee\nreviewed and removed the escape risk designator from his file.  Accord to plaintiff, they determined\nhe was not an escape risk.  However, he remains confined in the SHU and has been denied any\nmeaningful review.  Further, plaintiff claims he is not eligible to see a parole commissioner for\nrelease on parole due to his confinement in Level 1 Security Detention status.  \nPlaintiff claims the appeal process for SCC decisions is for an inmate to file a grievance. \nHowever, it is meaningless for a prisoner to appeal a decision of the State Classification Committee. \nPlaintiff claims he is being retaliated against for filing grievances.  \nFinally, plaintiff complains that the confiscation of his typewriter without compensation is\ntheft.  Plaintiff claims the typewriter was being used to file the grievances it โbecomes obvious the\nmotive for the confiscation.โ\nThe Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\nPending before the court is a motion to dismiss plaintiffโs amended complaint filed by the\ndefendants (docket entry no. 20).  The defendants contend plaintiffโs claims should be dismissed for\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on the Eleventh Amendment.  Additionally, the defendants\nmove for dismissal of plaintiffโs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. \nStandard of Review\nAn in forma pauperis proceeding may be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e)(2)(B)\nif it: (1) is frivolous or malicious, (2) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or (3)\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.  \n5\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 6 of 16 PageID #:  162\nA complaint, containing as it does both factual allegations and legal conclusions, is frivolous\nwhere it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989);\nGeiger v. Jowers, 404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2005); McCormick v. Stalder, 105 F.3d 1059, 1061\n(5th Cir. 1997).   A complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably\nmeritless legal theory.  See Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). \nIn addition to the legal basis of the complaint, Section 1915 empowers the court to pierce the\nveil of the complainantโs factual allegations if they are clearly baseless.  Denton v. Hernandez, 504\nU.S. 25, 32 (1992); Ancar v. Sara Plasma, Inc., 964 F.2d 465 (5th Cir. 1992).  A complaint lacks\nan arguable basis in fact if, after providing the plaintiff the opportunity to present additional facts\nwhen necessary, the facts alleged are clearly baseless.  Denton, 504 U.S. at 32.   \nIn Denton v. Hernandez, the Supreme Court โdeclined the invitation to reduce the clearly\nbaseless inquiry to a monolithic standard.โ  Denton, 504 U.S. at 33.  Examples of complaints within\nthe clearly baseless inquiry are those which describe fanciful, fantastic, or delusional scenarios.  A\ncomplaint is factually frivolous if the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or wholly\nincredible.  Pleaded facts which are merely improbable or strange, however, are not clearly baseless\nfor Section 1915(d) purposes. Id.\nFailure to State a Claim\nUnder Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must contain โa short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). \nRule 12(b)(6) authorizes the court to dismiss a complaint for โfailure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).\nA complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if the factual allegations\nare not sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  Dismissal for failure\nto state a claim is appropriate when the plaintiff has failed to plead โsufficient factual matter,\naccepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โโ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n6\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 7 of 16 PageID #:  163\n662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570).  Plaintiffs must state \nenough facts to โnudge[] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.โ  Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570. \nโA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678.  At this stage, a court โmust accept all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint as \ntrue and must construe the allegations in the light that is most favorable to the plaintiff.โ  Cent. \nLaborersโ Pension Fund v. Integrated Elec. Servs., 497 F. 3d 546, 550 (5th Cir. 2007).  However, \nโ[t]hreadbare recitals  of  the  elements  of  a  cause  of  action,  supported  by  mere  conclusory \nstatements, do not suffice.โ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  โ[R]egardless of whether the plaintiff is \nproceeding pro se or is represented  by  counsel,  conclusory  allegations  or  legal  conclusions \nmasquerading  as  factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.โ  Taylor v. \nBooks a Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotations omitted).\nAnalysis\nI. Elements of a Cause of Action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\nTitle 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 authorizes a suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redressing\nviolations of the Constitution and federal law by those acting under color of state law.  See Nelson\nv.Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004); Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290 (1999).  It provides:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured .... \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nII. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\nThe Eleventh Amendment provides that the State of Texas, as well as its agencies, are\nimmune from liability.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114\n(1985).  The Eleventh Amendment bars claims against a state brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nAguilar v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1054 (5th Cir. 1998).  In Will v. Michigan\n7\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 8 of 16 PageID #:  164\nDepartment of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), the Supreme\nCourt held that โneither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are โpersonsโ under\nยง 1983.โ  The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the Michigan Department of State Police and\nits Director sued in his official capacity.  Id.  The Fifth Circuit has accordingly โheld that the\nEleventh Amendment bars recovering ยง 1983 money damages from TDCJ officers in their official\ncapacity.โ  Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 742 (5th Cir. 2002).  However, โthe Eleventh Amendment\npermits suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials acting in violation of federal\nlaw.โ  Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437, 124 S. Ct. 899, 157 L. Ed. 2d 855 (2004);\nAguillar, 160 F. 3d at 1054.\nThe narrow exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, the Ex parte Young\nexception, โis based on the legal fiction that a sovereign state cannot act unconstitutionally[; t]hus,\nwhere a state actor enforces an unconstitutional law, he is stripped of his official clothing and\nbecomes a private person subject to suit.โ  K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 124 (5th Cir. 2010).  โIn\norder to use the Ex Parte Young exception, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the state officer has\nโsome connectionโ with the enforcement of the disputed act.โ  Id.  In determining whether the\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young avoids the bar to suit under the Eleventh Amendment, a court need only\nconduct a straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of\nfederal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.โ  Verizon Md., Inc. V. Pub. Serv.\nCommโn,  535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002).  \nIn his complaint, plaintiff alleges that defendants Harris and Rehse are responsible for\nensuring that prisoners in the SHU are housed in sanitary conditions and not subjected to harassment,\nretaliation or cruel and unusual punishment.  Plaintiff also alleges certain defendants failed to follow\nprison policy regarding the review of his classification status.  Plaintiff, however, must first\ndemonstrate he meets the three elements of Article III standing; (1) injury in fact; (2) causation; and\n(3) redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  The redressability\nelement of the test for standing requires that a favorable decision for the plaintiff will likely, not\n8\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 9 of 16 PageID #:  165\nmerely speculatively, redress the plaintiffโs injury.  Id.  Additionally, the court must gauge (1) the\nability of the official to enforce the statue at issue under his statutory or constitutional power, and\n(2)the demonstrated willingness of the official to enforce the statute.  Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d\n405, 425-27 (5th Cir. 2001).  Defendants Harris and Rehse are no longer the warden at the Polunsky\nUnit.  Further, plaintiffโs complaint reveals that the ability to address his complaints lies with the\nDirector of the prison system based on plaintiffโs history of violence and escape.1  The defendants\nin this action do not have the ability to release plaintiff from confinement in the Special Housing\nUnit.  Therefore, a favorable decision for plaintiff will not allow the defendants to address plaintiffโs\ncomplained of injury.  Accordingly, the defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nIII. Due Process - Classification\nPlaintiff alleges his classification and continued confinement in administrative segregation\nviolates his right to due process.  Additionally, while plaintiff concedes he receives reviews by the\nAdministrative Segregation Committee every thirty days and reviews by State Classification\nCommittee members which he attends every 180 days, plaintiff complains the reviews are not\nmeaningful because he has not been released from administrative segregation to general population. \nIt is well settled in the Fifth Circuit that an inmate has no protected interest in any particular\ncustody or security classification, once incarcerated.  See Wilkerson v. Stalder, 329 F.3d 431, 435-36\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S.Ct. 432 (2003); Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999);\nWhitley v. Hunt, 158 F.3d 882, 889 (5th Cir. 1998).  The classification of prisoners is a matter within\nthe discretion of prison officials.  McCord v. Maggio, 910 F.2d 1248, 1250 (5th Cir. 1990). \nTherefore, absent an abuse of discretion, a federal court will not interfere with administrative\ndeterminations regarding custodial classification of an inmate.  Whitley, 158 F.3d at 889.  In\n1 The TDCJ Offender Information website reveals plaintiff is serving multiple cumulative sentences for five\naggravated robberies with a deadly weapon, impersonating a public servant/security officer, and two separate escapes\nfrom custody.  Further, plaintiff has seventy-five yearsโ imprisonment remaining to satisfy his maximum sentence.  See\nhttps://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/search.action.  Additionally, plaintiff has federal convictions for\ncarjacking, robbery, using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, and illegally possessing a firearm.  See\nUnited States v. Hope, 102 F.3d 114 (5th Cir. 1996). \n9\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 10 of 16 PageID #:  166\nPichardo v. Kinker, 73 F.3d 612 (5th Cir. 1996), the court stated that โabsent extraordinary\ncircumstances, administrative segregation as such, being an incident to the ordinary life as a prisoner,\nwill never be a ground for a constitutional claim.โ  Id. at 612-613; see also Wilkinson v. Austin, 545\nU.S. 209, 221 (2005) (โ[T]he Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding\ntransfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.โ). \nPlaintiff admits he is receiving regular reviews by the defendants in this action.  As set forth\nabove, a review of plaintiffโs complaint reveals that the ability to address his complaints regarding\nrelease from administrative segregation lies solely with the Director of the prison system.  A review\nof plaintiffโs federal criminal appeal provides some background for why the director may have\nretained sole authority regarding plaintiffโs possible release to General Population.  On November\n26, 1994, plaintiff made his second escape from the Texas state prison system and later stole a car\nat knife point.  See United States v. Hope, 102 F.3d 114, 115 (5th Cir. 1996).  Plaintiff severely cut\nthe 83-year-old driver of the car, dropped him off on the side of the road, and proceeded on a crime\nspree of armed robberies until his arrest in Memphis, Tennessee approximately two months later. \nId. at 115-16.  \nAs previously stated, the classification of prisoners is a matter within the discretion of prison\nofficials.  Here, given plaintiffโs history of violence and escapes, plaintiff has failed to show an abuse\nof discretion.  Further, the defendants are providing plaintiff with due process reviews of his\nclassification in accordance with their authority.  Thus, plaintiffโs claims fail to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted and the defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nIV. Conditions of Confinement \nPlaintiff asserts an extensive list of complaints about the conditions of his confinement\nincluding the cleanliness of his cells and eating utensils, the quality and quantity of food served in\nconfinement, a restriction on the amount of property he can maintain in his cell, the fact he is served\npeanut butter sandwiches during lock-downs approximately four times per year, the lack of\ncondiments such as syrup and mustard, and the alleged indirect exposure to chemical agents.\n10\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 11 of 16 PageID #:  167\nThe Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons but neither does it permit inhumane\nones.  Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999).  โThe Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment imposes minimum requirements on prison officials in the\ntreatment received by and facilities available to prisoners.โ  Woods v. Edwards, 51 F.3d 577 (5th Cir.\n1995).  The Supreme Court noted in Farmer that:  In its prohibition of โcruel and unusual\npunishments,โ the Eighth Amendment places restraints on prison officials, who may not, for\nexample, use excessive force against prisoners.  The Amendment also imposes duties on these\nofficials, who must provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure that\ninmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must โtake reasonable\nmeasures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.โ  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 823.\nA constitutional violation, however, occurs only when two requirements are met.  First, there\nis an objective requirement that the condition โmust be so serious as to โdeprive prisoners of the\nminimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities,โ as when it denies the prisoner some basic human\nneed.โ  Harris v. Angelina County, Texas, 31 F.3d 331, 334 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing Wilson v. Seiter,\n501 U.S. 294, 111 S. Ct. 2321 (1991)).  Second, under a subjective standard, the court must\ndetermine whether the prison official responsible acted with deliberate indifference to inmate health\nor safety.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834; see e.g., Harris, 31 F.3d at 334-36.  The deliberate indifference\nstandard can be appropriately applied to allegations regarding the conditions of confinement.  Woods,\n51 F.3d at 580.\nIn Farmer, the Supreme Court adopted โsubjective recklessness as used in the criminal lawโ\nas the appropriate definition of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 839-40.  Under this definition, a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. \nThe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial\nrisk of serious harm exists, and he must draw the inference.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  A prison\n11\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 12 of 16 PageID #:  168\nofficial acts with deliberate indifference โonly if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of\nserious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.โ  Id. at 847.\nโDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.โ  Domino v. Texas Depโt of\nCriminal Justice, 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001).  Deliberate indifference encompasses only the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind.  McCormick v.\nStalder, 105 F.3d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir. 1999).  To satisfy the exacting deliberate indifference\nstandard, a defendantโs conduct must rise โto the level of egregious intentional conduct.โ  Gobert\nv. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 351 (5th Cir. 2006).  \nWhile the conditions of plaintiffโs confinement may be unpleasant and possibly harsh,\nplaintiff has failed to show the conditions were objectively so serious as to deprive plaintiff of the\nminimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.  Plaintiff has failed to show such conditions rise to\nthe level of a constitutional violation, nor has he satisfied the extremely high standard of showing\nthe defendants acted with deliberate indifference.  Accordingly, the defendantsโ motion to dismiss\nshould be granted.  \nAdditionally, plaintiff complains he is restricted in the amount of personal and legal property\nhe may possess in his cell and that his access to legal materials is reduced due to his housing\nlocation.  As a result, plaintiff claims research takes him longer than if he were allowed to go to the\nlaw library.  Further, plaintiff claims he is denied access to other prisoners knowledgeable in the law. \nHowever, plaintiff has failed to allege or demonstrate any harm associated with such claims.\nNext, to the extent plaintiff complains that the defendantsโ actions were retaliatory, plaintiffโs\nretaliation claim fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  To state a valid claim for\nretaliation โan inmate must allege the violation of a specific constitutional right and be prepared to\nestablish that but for the retaliatory motive the complained of incident ... would not have occurred.โ \nWoods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir. 1995).  Mere conclusory allegations of retaliation will\nbe insufficient to state a retaliation claim.  See Id. \n12\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 13 of 16 PageID #:  169\nIn this case, plaintiff has failed to show either a retaliatory motive or causation regarding his\nclaims against the defendants.  Plaintiff has failed to produce either direct evidence of motivation\nor allege a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.  Plaintiffโs\nallegations of retaliation are no more than mere speculation on the part of plaintiff.  Thus, plaintiff\nhas failed to state a claim of retaliation under ยง 1983 against the defendants.  Accordingly, the\ndefendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nV. Medical Care\nPlaintiff complains that, because of his custodial status and the requirement that he is to be\nescorted everywhere he goes, he often is not able to attend medical appointments due to lack of\nsecurity personnel.  Additionally, plaintiff complains that he suffers from bouts of anxiety,\ndepression, and visual and auditory hallucinations but when he has reported these bouts or symptoms\nto mental health personnel, he has been denied treatment.\nThe deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment, whether the indifference is\nmanifested by prison doctors or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to\nmedical care.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-05 (1976); Harris v. Hegmann, 198 F.3d 153, 159\n(5th Cir. 1999).  โDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.โ  Domino v. Texas\nDepโt of Criminal Justice, 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001).  Deliberate indifference encompasses\nonly the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind. \nMcCormick v. Stalder, 105 F.3d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir. 1999).  To satisfy the exacting deliberate\nindifference standard, a defendantโs conduct must rise โto the level of egregious intentional\nconduct.โ  Gobert v. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 351 (5th Cir. 2006). \nThe Supreme Court has adopted โsubjective recklessness as used in the criminal lawโ as the\nappropriate definition of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer, 511 U.S.\n825, 839-40 (1994).  Under this definition, a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. \n13\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 14 of 16 PageID #:  170\nThe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial\nrisk of serious harm exists, and he must draw the inference.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  Under\nexceptional circumstances, a prison officialโs knowledge of a substantial risk of harm may be\ninferred by the obviousness of the substantial risk.  Id; Reeves v. Collins, 27 F.3d 174 (5th Cir.\n1994).  Medical records of sick calls, examination, diagnoses, and medications may rebut an\ninmateโs allegations of deliberate indifference.  See Varnado v. Lynaugh, 920 F.2d 320 (5th Cir.\n1991).\nWhile plaintiff complains he missed some medical appointments due to the lack of security\npersonnel required for escorting him, plaintiff admitted medical personnel would make cell-side\nvisits for him.  Further, plaintiff has failed to allege or demonstrate harm associated with the format\nof his medical visits.  Additionally, plaintiff claims he suffers from bouts of anxiety, depression, and\nvisual and auditory hallucinations but when he has reported these bouts or symptoms to mental\nhealth personnel, he has been denied treatment.  However, plaintiff has failed to allege facts\ndemonstrating the defendants possessed a โsufficiently culpable state of mindโ rising to the level of\ndeliberate indifference or that his claims are anything more than a disagreement with the medical\nprofessionals over the proper course of treatment.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 839-40.  Thus,\nplaintiffโs allegations fail to rise to the level of egregious intentional misconduct required to satisfy\nthe exacting deliberate indifference standard.  See Gobert, 463 F.3d at 351.  Negligence does not\nconstitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Unsuccessful medical treatment, acts of negligence\nor medical malpractice, and disagreements as to diagnosis or treatment do not constitute deliberate\nindifference.  Banuelos v. McFarland, 41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir. 1995).  Dissatisfaction with\nmedical treatment or diagnosis does not constitute โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a serious medical need\nand does not rise to the level of the denial of a constitutional right.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at\n106; Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985).  At most, plaintiffโs allegations\nconstitute nothing more than negligence or a disagreement with the medical professionals over the\nproper course of treatment.  Plaintiff has failed to show either that the defendants acted with\n14\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 15 of 16 PageID #:  171\ndeliberate indifference or that he was harmed as a result of the defendantsโ actions.  Therefore, the\ndefendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nAdditionally, the defendantsโ alleged failure to follow prison regulations, rules or procedures\ndoes not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  Stanley v. Foster, 464 F.3d 565, 569 (5th Cir.\n2006); Hernandez v. Estelle, 788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1986).  Therefore, plaintiffโs allegations\nfail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Thus, the defendantsโ motion should be\ngranted.\nVI. Deprivation of Property\nFinally, plaintiff complains that the confiscation of his typewriter without compensation is\ntheft.  Plaintiff claims the typewriter was being used to file the grievances it โbecomes obvious the\nmotive for the confiscation.โ\nA claim that an individual has been deprived of property by a person acting under color of\nlaw states a claim for a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.  Deprivations of property by prison officials, however, even when intentional,\ndo not violate the due process clause so long as an adequate post-deprivation remedy exists.  See\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); see also Geiger v.\nJowers, 404 F.3d 3771, 374 (5th Cir. 2005) (concluding that plaintiff failed to state a claim\nregardless of whether the deprivation of property was the result of negligence or intentional\nmisconduct).  Texas provides such a remedy.  See Murphy v. Collins, 26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.\n1994) (holding that, in Texas, the tort of conversion is an adequate post-deprivation remedy);\nThompson v. Steele, 709 F.2d 381, 383 (5th  Cir. 1983) (holding that a state action for damages is\nan adequate remedy), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 897 (1983).  As a result, plaintiff has failed to establish\nhis constitutional rights were violated in connection with the deprivation of property.  Further,\nplaintiffโs claim of retaliation, as explained above, is speculative and conclusory.  Thus, plaintiffโs\nallegations are insufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Accordingly,\nplaintiffโs claims are frivolous and fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n15\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 16 of 16 PageID #:  172\nRecommendation\nThe defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.  Accordingly, plaintiffsโ complaint\nshould be dismissed with prejudice. \nObjections\nWithin fourteen days after being served with a copy of the magistrate judgeโs report, any\nparty may serve and file written objections to the findings of facts, conclusions of law and\nrecommendations of the magistrate judge. 28 U.S.C. ยง 636 (b)(1)(C).\nFailure to file written objections to the proposed findings of facts, conclusions of law and\nrecommendations contained within this report within fourteen days after service shall bar an\naggrieved party from the entitlement of de novo review by the district court of the proposed findings,\nconclusions  and  recommendations  and  from  appellate  review  of  factual  findings  and  legal\nconclusions accepted by the district court except on grounds of plain error.

Plaintiff claims\nhe has been held in Administrative Segregation continuously for the last twenty-three years and has\nbeen told he cannot be transferred from this environment because he has an escape on his record. \nPlaintiff complains he is confined to his cell for twenty-three hours per day for 191 days a year and\ntwenty-four hours per day on the remaining 174 days of the year.  However, plaintiff later states he\nis allowed out of his cell two hours per day for recreation five days per week.\nPlaintiff claims he is fed in his cell through a tray slot opening in the cell door and is fed on\nunsanitary food trays and, as a result, he claims he has suffered incidents of food poisoning. \nAdditionally, plaintiff complains that the meals are cold even though they are delivered in a โHot\nCart.โ  Plaintiff alleges the food portions given to inmates in Administrative Segregation are smaller\nthan the portions given to inmates and General Population, and they are not provided many of the\ncondiments provided to General Population inmates such as mustard and syrup.\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 2 of 16 PageID #:  158\nNext, plaintiff complains he is required to submit to a strip search prior to being removed \nfrom his cell for any reason.  He claims he is strip searched, on average, four times per day.  Plaintiff \nstates he is required to squat down to place his hands through the tray slot to be hand-cuffed, \nstraining his shoulders and rotator cuffs.  However, according to plaintiff, defendants Harris, the unit \nwarden, and Rehse, the unit major, refuse to allow him to be handcuffed in the front of his body. \nPlaintiff claims the defendants are deliberately indifferent to his medical needs.\nPlaintiff also complains he is limited in the amount and kind of property he can possess in \nthe SHU.  He claims this reduces the amount of reading material and other personal items he may \npossess, and the amount of property is smaller than inmates in General Population are allowed. \nPlaintiff complains he cannot possess a razor, pencil sharpener or clothing that has elastic in it.\nNext, plaintiff complains that due to being housed alone in his administrative segregation \ncell, he is denied almost all human contact, and his only human contact is with officers and medical \nstaff.  Plaintiff claims he is denied contact visitation with his family and has to visit through a \nplexiglass partition and talk over a phone.\nPlaintiff claims he also is denied access to a television, and is only permitted to use a \ntelephone in an emergency situation after approval by unit administration.  Plaintiff complains \nhe is only permitted to call persons on his approved visitor list which consists of ten people \ninstead of the twenty people allowed for prisoners in General Population.\nPlaintiff complains that his housing area is loud all hours of the day due to both inmates and \nofficers.  Plaintiff claims this deprives him of โquality sleep and only allows him to sleep fitfully \nseveral hours at a time.โ  Plaintiff claims this adds to his anxiety and depression.  \nPlaintiff claims he has been indirectly exposed to the use of chemical agents at least ten times \nin the last two years through no fault of his own.  Plaintiff claims prison officials are aggressive and \ncareless with their use of chemical agents and use them in excessive amounts in unwarranted \nsituations with no regard to the other prisoners they expose to these gases.  \n2\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 3 of 16 PageID #:  159\nNext, plaintiff complains the SHU is locked down a minimum of four times a year compared\nto two lock-downs per year in General Population.  In addition to the lock-downs, plaintiff claims\ncells are randomly searched and inspected every other day.  While on lock-down, plaintiff complains\nthat he is given a โJohnnyโ consisting of two sandwiches in a sack for each meal, and one of the\nsandwiches is peanut butter.  Plaintiff complains the sack lunches have less calories than the food\nserved on trays and has subjected him to weight loss and constipation.  Plaintiff claims that during\nthe lock-downs the walkways are not mopped and showers are not cleaned.  As a result, plaintiff\nclaims the showers have mold and mildew on the walls.  \nPlaintiff also complains his access to legal materials is reduced due to his housing location. \nAs a result, plaintiff claims research takes him longer than if he were allowed to go to the law library.\nAdditionally, plaintiff claims he is denied access to other prisoners knowledgeable in the law.\nNext, plaintiff claims that following an incident in 2012 in which a ten inch screwdriver was\nfound in his cell or property, he has been moved to a different cell each week to harass him and\nretaliate against him.  Plaintiff claims both Warden Harris and Major Rehse order his weekly moves\nas a form of harassment and without penological reason.\nPlaintiff claims that when he moves into a new cell it is not disinfected or otherwise cleaned,\nand he is not provided with cleaning supplies.  On some occasions, plaintiff claims he was moved\ninto a cell with no lights.  On December 21, 2017, plaintiff claims he was moved into a cell with\nmold on the back wall and floor.  He claims he remained in that cell for thirteen days and began\ncoughing.  Plaintiff claims that it took outside advocates contacting the warden to get him moved\nfrom the cell.  Plaintiff claims defendant Rehse saw the mold on the back wall of his cell on\nDecember 26, 2017, but it was only after Assistant Warden Jefferson sent someone to inspect the\ncell and saw the mold growth that she ordered him removed from the cell. \nPlaintiff complains that, due to his housing classification requiring an escort everywhere he\ngoes, he has no privacy when consulting with medical or mental health professionals.  Plaintiff\nclaims the lack of escort officers is not uncommon resulting in delayed or cancelled appointments\n3\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 4 of 16 PageID #:  160\nand medical or mental health personnel frequently making cell-side visits where other prisoners can\nlisten.  Plaintiff also claims he has reported to mental health professionals that he deals with bouts\nof anxiety, depression, and visual and auditory hallucinations but he has been denied treatment for\nthese conditions.  \nPlaintiff states the Administrative Segregation Committee conducts a hearing concerning his\nconfinement at thirty-day intervals, but he is not allowed to attend.  Plaintiff complains that the\ncommittee has no authority to release him and the reviews are a sham and meaningless because the\nState Classification Committee has already decided he will remain in the SHU for the next 180 days. \nPlaintiff states he is reviewed by the State Classification Committee every 180 days to determine\nwhether he will remain in the SHU or be released to general population.   \nOn June 24, 2016, plaintiff claims he was reviewed by SCC member Melissa Benet.  Plaintiff\nmade both an oral and written statement at the hearing.  After she looked over his file, plaintiff\nclaims Benet told him she saw no reason not to release him to a transitional program.  However, he\nlater received his hearing record in the mail, and it indicated he was to remain in the SHU without\nfurther explanation.  At a subsequent hearing on December 3, 2016, plaintiff claims he asked Benet\nwhy he was not released to the transitional program like she told him in June of 2016.  Plaintiff states\nBenet told him โyou are high profile, I donโt have the authority to release you.โ  Thus, plaintiff\nclaims Benetโs review was perfunctory and a sham used to provide him due process.  Plaintiff claims\nhe saw another SCC member, Ms. Enlow, on June 8, 2017 and when he requested release he was\ninformed โthatโs not my decision.โ  Plaintiff claims he was later reviewed by SCC member defendant\nBonnie Fiveash.  Plaintiff claims Fiveash told him โyouโre still in good shape I canโt release you.โ \nWhen asked if it was ever her call to make, plaintiff claims Fiveash told him โthat would be the\nDirectorโs call.โ  Plaintiff complains that he has not been told what he must do to be released to\nGeneral Population.  Plaintiff claims defendant Eschessa, the Deputy Director of Operations has the\ncapacity to release him to General Population, but Eschessa would not review his file.  Plaintiff also\nclaims defendant White, Assistant Director of Classifications, was contacted by outside advocates\n4\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 5 of 16 PageID #:  161\nand stated she would not allow his release or make recommendations for his release.  White stated\nthat because plaintiff escaped in 1994 she does not want the responsibility that goes along with\nmaking that decision.  Plaintiff claims White has instructed all SCC members that plaintiff is to\nremain in the SHU.  \nPlaintiff claims that in December, 2005, the Security Precautions Designator Committee\nreviewed and removed the escape risk designator from his file.  Accord to plaintiff, they determined\nhe was not an escape risk.  However, he remains confined in the SHU and has been denied any\nmeaningful review.  Further, plaintiff claims he is not eligible to see a parole commissioner for\nrelease on parole due to his confinement in Level 1 Security Detention status.  \nPlaintiff claims the appeal process for SCC decisions is for an inmate to file a grievance. \nHowever, it is meaningless for a prisoner to appeal a decision of the State Classification Committee. \nPlaintiff claims he is being retaliated against for filing grievances.  \nFinally, plaintiff complains that the confiscation of his typewriter without compensation is\ntheft.  Plaintiff claims the typewriter was being used to file the grievances it โbecomes obvious the\nmotive for the confiscation.โ\nThe Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\nPending before the court is a motion to dismiss plaintiffโs amended complaint filed by the\ndefendants (docket entry no. 20).  The defendants contend plaintiffโs claims should be dismissed for\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on the Eleventh Amendment.  Additionally, the defendants\nmove for dismissal of plaintiffโs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. \nStandard of Review\nAn in forma pauperis proceeding may be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e)(2)(B)\nif it: (1) is frivolous or malicious, (2) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or (3)\nseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.  \n5\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 6 of 16 PageID #:  162\nA complaint, containing as it does both factual allegations and legal conclusions, is frivolous\nwhere it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989);\nGeiger v. Jowers, 404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2005); McCormick v. Stalder, 105 F.3d 1059, 1061\n(5th Cir. 1997).   A complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably\nmeritless legal theory.  See Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). \nIn addition to the legal basis of the complaint, Section 1915 empowers the court to pierce the\nveil of the complainantโs factual allegations if they are clearly baseless.  Denton v. Hernandez, 504\nU.S. 25, 32 (1992); Ancar v. Sara Plasma, Inc., 964 F.2d 465 (5th Cir. 1992).  A complaint lacks\nan arguable basis in fact if, after providing the plaintiff the opportunity to present additional facts\nwhen necessary, the facts alleged are clearly baseless.  Denton, 504 U.S. at 32.   \nIn Denton v. Hernandez, the Supreme Court โdeclined the invitation to reduce the clearly\nbaseless inquiry to a monolithic standard.โ  Denton, 504 U.S. at 33.  Examples of complaints within\nthe clearly baseless inquiry are those which describe fanciful, fantastic, or delusional scenarios.  A\ncomplaint is factually frivolous if the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or wholly\nincredible.  Pleaded facts which are merely improbable or strange, however, are not clearly baseless\nfor Section 1915(d) purposes. Id.\nFailure to State a Claim\nUnder Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must contain โa short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). \nRule 12(b)(6) authorizes the court to dismiss a complaint for โfailure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).\nA complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if the factual allegations\nare not sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  Dismissal for failure\nto state a claim is appropriate when the plaintiff has failed to plead โsufficient factual matter,\naccepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โโ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n6\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 7 of 16 PageID #:  163\n662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570).  Plaintiffs must state \nenough facts to โnudge[] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.โ  Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570. \nโA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678.  At this stage, a court โmust accept all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint as \ntrue and must construe the allegations in the light that is most favorable to the plaintiff.โ  Cent. \nLaborersโ Pension Fund v. Integrated Elec. Servs., 497 F. 3d 546, 550 (5th Cir. 2007).  However, \nโ[t]hreadbare recitals  of  the  elements  of  a  cause  of  action,  supported  by  mere  conclusory \nstatements, do not suffice.โ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  โ[R]egardless of whether the plaintiff is \nproceeding pro se or is represented  by  counsel,  conclusory  allegations  or  legal  conclusions \nmasquerading  as  factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.โ  Taylor v. \nBooks a Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotations omitted).\nAnalysis\nI. Elements of a Cause of Action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\nTitle 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 authorizes a suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redressing\nviolations of the Constitution and federal law by those acting under color of state law.  See Nelson\nv.Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004); Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290 (1999).  It provides:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured .... \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nII. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\nThe Eleventh Amendment provides that the State of Texas, as well as its agencies, are\nimmune from liability.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114\n(1985).  The Eleventh Amendment bars claims against a state brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nAguilar v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1054 (5th Cir. 1998).  In Will v. Michigan\n7\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 8 of 16 PageID #:  164\nDepartment of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), the Supreme\nCourt held that โneither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are โpersonsโ under\nยง 1983.โ  The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the Michigan Department of State Police and\nits Director sued in his official capacity.  Id.  The Fifth Circuit has accordingly โheld that the\nEleventh Amendment bars recovering ยง 1983 money damages from TDCJ officers in their official\ncapacity.โ  Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 742 (5th Cir. 2002).  However, โthe Eleventh Amendment\npermits suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials acting in violation of federal\nlaw.โ  Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437, 124 S. Ct. 899, 157 L. Ed. 2d 855 (2004);\nAguillar, 160 F. 3d at 1054.\nThe narrow exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, the Ex parte Young\nexception, โis based on the legal fiction that a sovereign state cannot act unconstitutionally[; t]hus,\nwhere a state actor enforces an unconstitutional law, he is stripped of his official clothing and\nbecomes a private person subject to suit.โ  K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 124 (5th Cir. 2010).  โIn\norder to use the Ex Parte Young exception, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the state officer has\nโsome connectionโ with the enforcement of the disputed act.โ  Id.  In determining whether the\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young avoids the bar to suit under the Eleventh Amendment, a court need only\nconduct a straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of\nfederal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.โ  Verizon Md., Inc. V. Pub. Serv.\nCommโn,  535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002).  \nIn his complaint, plaintiff alleges that defendants Harris and Rehse are responsible for\nensuring that prisoners in the SHU are housed in sanitary conditions and not subjected to harassment,\nretaliation or cruel and unusual punishment.  Plaintiff also alleges certain defendants failed to follow\nprison policy regarding the review of his classification status.  Plaintiff, however, must first\ndemonstrate he meets the three elements of Article III standing; (1) injury in fact; (2) causation; and\n(3) redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  The redressability\nelement of the test for standing requires that a favorable decision for the plaintiff will likely, not\n8\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 9 of 16 PageID #:  165\nmerely speculatively, redress the plaintiffโs injury.  Id.  Additionally, the court must gauge (1) the\nability of the official to enforce the statue at issue under his statutory or constitutional power, and\n(2)the demonstrated willingness of the official to enforce the statute.  Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d\n405, 425-27 (5th Cir. 2001).  Defendants Harris and Rehse are no longer the warden at the Polunsky\nUnit.  Further, plaintiffโs complaint reveals that the ability to address his complaints lies with the\nDirector of the prison system based on plaintiffโs history of violence and escape.1  The defendants\nin this action do not have the ability to release plaintiff from confinement in the Special Housing\nUnit.  Therefore, a favorable decision for plaintiff will not allow the defendants to address plaintiffโs\ncomplained of injury.  Accordingly, the defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nIII. Due Process - Classification\nPlaintiff alleges his classification and continued confinement in administrative segregation\nviolates his right to due process.  Additionally, while plaintiff concedes he receives reviews by the\nAdministrative Segregation Committee every thirty days and reviews by State Classification\nCommittee members which he attends every 180 days, plaintiff complains the reviews are not\nmeaningful because he has not been released from administrative segregation to general population. \nIt is well settled in the Fifth Circuit that an inmate has no protected interest in any particular\ncustody or security classification, once incarcerated.  See Wilkerson v. Stalder, 329 F.3d 431, 435-36\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S.Ct. 432 (2003); Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999);\nWhitley v. Hunt, 158 F.3d 882, 889 (5th Cir. 1998).  The classification of prisoners is a matter within\nthe discretion of prison officials.  McCord v. Maggio, 910 F.2d 1248, 1250 (5th Cir. 1990). \nTherefore, absent an abuse of discretion, a federal court will not interfere with administrative\ndeterminations regarding custodial classification of an inmate.  Whitley, 158 F.3d at 889.  In\n1 The TDCJ Offender Information website reveals plaintiff is serving multiple cumulative sentences for five\naggravated robberies with a deadly weapon, impersonating a public servant/security officer, and two separate escapes\nfrom custody.  Further, plaintiff has seventy-five yearsโ imprisonment remaining to satisfy his maximum sentence.  See\nhttps://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/search.action.  Additionally, plaintiff has federal convictions for\ncarjacking, robbery, using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, and illegally possessing a firearm.  See\nUnited States v. Hope, 102 F.3d 114 (5th Cir. 1996). \n9\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 10 of 16 PageID #:  166\nPichardo v. Kinker, 73 F.3d 612 (5th Cir. 1996), the court stated that โabsent extraordinary\ncircumstances, administrative segregation as such, being an incident to the ordinary life as a prisoner,\nwill never be a ground for a constitutional claim.โ  Id. at 612-613; see also Wilkinson v. Austin, 545\nU.S. 209, 221 (2005) (โ[T]he Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding\ntransfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.โ). \nPlaintiff admits he is receiving regular reviews by the defendants in this action.  As set forth\nabove, a review of plaintiffโs complaint reveals that the ability to address his complaints regarding\nrelease from administrative segregation lies solely with the Director of the prison system.  A review\nof plaintiffโs federal criminal appeal provides some background for why the director may have\nretained sole authority regarding plaintiffโs possible release to General Population.  On November\n26, 1994, plaintiff made his second escape from the Texas state prison system and later stole a car\nat knife point.  See United States v. Hope, 102 F.3d 114, 115 (5th Cir. 1996).  Plaintiff severely cut\nthe 83-year-old driver of the car, dropped him off on the side of the road, and proceeded on a crime\nspree of armed robberies until his arrest in Memphis, Tennessee approximately two months later. \nId. at 115-16.  \nAs previously stated, the classification of prisoners is a matter within the discretion of prison\nofficials.  Here, given plaintiffโs history of violence and escapes, plaintiff has failed to show an abuse\nof discretion.  Further, the defendants are providing plaintiff with due process reviews of his\nclassification in accordance with their authority.  Thus, plaintiffโs claims fail to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted and the defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nIV. Conditions of Confinement \nPlaintiff asserts an extensive list of complaints about the conditions of his confinement\nincluding the cleanliness of his cells and eating utensils, the quality and quantity of food served in\nconfinement, a restriction on the amount of property he can maintain in his cell, the fact he is served\npeanut butter sandwiches during lock-downs approximately four times per year, the lack of\ncondiments such as syrup and mustard, and the alleged indirect exposure to chemical agents.\n10\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 11 of 16 PageID #:  167\nThe Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons but neither does it permit inhumane\nones.  Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999).  โThe Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment imposes minimum requirements on prison officials in the\ntreatment received by and facilities available to prisoners.โ  Woods v. Edwards, 51 F.3d 577 (5th Cir.\n1995).  The Supreme Court noted in Farmer that:  In its prohibition of โcruel and unusual\npunishments,โ the Eighth Amendment places restraints on prison officials, who may not, for\nexample, use excessive force against prisoners.  The Amendment also imposes duties on these\nofficials, who must provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure that\ninmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must โtake reasonable\nmeasures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.โ  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 823.\nA constitutional violation, however, occurs only when two requirements are met.  First, there\nis an objective requirement that the condition โmust be so serious as to โdeprive prisoners of the\nminimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities,โ as when it denies the prisoner some basic human\nneed.โ  Harris v. Angelina County, Texas, 31 F.3d 331, 334 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing Wilson v. Seiter,\n501 U.S. 294, 111 S. Ct. 2321 (1991)).  Second, under a subjective standard, the court must\ndetermine whether the prison official responsible acted with deliberate indifference to inmate health\nor safety.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834; see e.g., Harris, 31 F.3d at 334-36.  The deliberate indifference\nstandard can be appropriately applied to allegations regarding the conditions of confinement.  Woods,\n51 F.3d at 580.\nIn Farmer, the Supreme Court adopted โsubjective recklessness as used in the criminal lawโ\nas the appropriate definition of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 839-40.  Under this definition, a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. \nThe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial\nrisk of serious harm exists, and he must draw the inference.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  A prison\n11\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 12 of 16 PageID #:  168\nofficial acts with deliberate indifference โonly if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of\nserious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.โ  Id. at 847.\nโDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.โ  Domino v. Texas Depโt of\nCriminal Justice, 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001).  Deliberate indifference encompasses only the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind.  McCormick v.\nStalder, 105 F.3d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir. 1999).  To satisfy the exacting deliberate indifference\nstandard, a defendantโs conduct must rise โto the level of egregious intentional conduct.โ  Gobert\nv. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 351 (5th Cir. 2006).  \nWhile the conditions of plaintiffโs confinement may be unpleasant and possibly harsh,\nplaintiff has failed to show the conditions were objectively so serious as to deprive plaintiff of the\nminimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.  Plaintiff has failed to show such conditions rise to\nthe level of a constitutional violation, nor has he satisfied the extremely high standard of showing\nthe defendants acted with deliberate indifference.  Accordingly, the defendantsโ motion to dismiss\nshould be granted.  \nAdditionally, plaintiff complains he is restricted in the amount of personal and legal property\nhe may possess in his cell and that his access to legal materials is reduced due to his housing\nlocation.  As a result, plaintiff claims research takes him longer than if he were allowed to go to the\nlaw library.  Further, plaintiff claims he is denied access to other prisoners knowledgeable in the law. \nHowever, plaintiff has failed to allege or demonstrate any harm associated with such claims.\nNext, to the extent plaintiff complains that the defendantsโ actions were retaliatory, plaintiffโs\nretaliation claim fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  To state a valid claim for\nretaliation โan inmate must allege the violation of a specific constitutional right and be prepared to\nestablish that but for the retaliatory motive the complained of incident ... would not have occurred.โ \nWoods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir. 1995).  Mere conclusory allegations of retaliation will\nbe insufficient to state a retaliation claim.  See Id. \n12\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 13 of 16 PageID #:  169\nIn this case, plaintiff has failed to show either a retaliatory motive or causation regarding his\nclaims against the defendants.  Plaintiff has failed to produce either direct evidence of motivation\nor allege a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.  Plaintiffโs\nallegations of retaliation are no more than mere speculation on the part of plaintiff.  Thus, plaintiff\nhas failed to state a claim of retaliation under ยง 1983 against the defendants.  Accordingly, the\ndefendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nV. Medical Care\nPlaintiff complains that, because of his custodial status and the requirement that he is to be\nescorted everywhere he goes, he often is not able to attend medical appointments due to lack of\nsecurity personnel.  Additionally, plaintiff complains that he suffers from bouts of anxiety,\ndepression, and visual and auditory hallucinations but when he has reported these bouts or symptoms\nto mental health personnel, he has been denied treatment.\nThe deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment, whether the indifference is\nmanifested by prison doctors or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to\nmedical care.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-05 (1976); Harris v. Hegmann, 198 F.3d 153, 159\n(5th Cir. 1999).  โDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.โ  Domino v. Texas\nDepโt of Criminal Justice, 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001).  Deliberate indifference encompasses\nonly the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind. \nMcCormick v. Stalder, 105 F.3d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir. 1999).  To satisfy the exacting deliberate\nindifference standard, a defendantโs conduct must rise โto the level of egregious intentional\nconduct.โ  Gobert v. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 351 (5th Cir. 2006). \nThe Supreme Court has adopted โsubjective recklessness as used in the criminal lawโ as the\nappropriate definition of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer, 511 U.S.\n825, 839-40 (1994).  Under this definition, a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. \n13\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 14 of 16 PageID #:  170\nThe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial\nrisk of serious harm exists, and he must draw the inference.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  Under\nexceptional circumstances, a prison officialโs knowledge of a substantial risk of harm may be\ninferred by the obviousness of the substantial risk.  Id; Reeves v. Collins, 27 F.3d 174 (5th Cir.\n1994).  Medical records of sick calls, examination, diagnoses, and medications may rebut an\ninmateโs allegations of deliberate indifference.  See Varnado v. Lynaugh, 920 F.2d 320 (5th Cir.\n1991).\nWhile plaintiff complains he missed some medical appointments due to the lack of security\npersonnel required for escorting him, plaintiff admitted medical personnel would make cell-side\nvisits for him.  Further, plaintiff has failed to allege or demonstrate harm associated with the format\nof his medical visits.  Additionally, plaintiff claims he suffers from bouts of anxiety, depression, and\nvisual and auditory hallucinations but when he has reported these bouts or symptoms to mental\nhealth personnel, he has been denied treatment.  However, plaintiff has failed to allege facts\ndemonstrating the defendants possessed a โsufficiently culpable state of mindโ rising to the level of\ndeliberate indifference or that his claims are anything more than a disagreement with the medical\nprofessionals over the proper course of treatment.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 839-40.  Thus,\nplaintiffโs allegations fail to rise to the level of egregious intentional misconduct required to satisfy\nthe exacting deliberate indifference standard.  See Gobert, 463 F.3d at 351.  Negligence does not\nconstitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Unsuccessful medical treatment, acts of negligence\nor medical malpractice, and disagreements as to diagnosis or treatment do not constitute deliberate\nindifference.  Banuelos v. McFarland, 41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir. 1995).  Dissatisfaction with\nmedical treatment or diagnosis does not constitute โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a serious medical need\nand does not rise to the level of the denial of a constitutional right.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at\n106; Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985).  At most, plaintiffโs allegations\nconstitute nothing more than negligence or a disagreement with the medical professionals over the\nproper course of treatment.  Plaintiff has failed to show either that the defendants acted with\n14\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 15 of 16 PageID #:  171\ndeliberate indifference or that he was harmed as a result of the defendantsโ actions.  Therefore, the\ndefendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nAdditionally, the defendantsโ alleged failure to follow prison regulations, rules or procedures\ndoes not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  Stanley v. Foster, 464 F.3d 565, 569 (5th Cir.\n2006); Hernandez v. Estelle, 788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1986).  Therefore, plaintiffโs allegations\nfail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Thus, the defendantsโ motion should be\ngranted.\nVI. Deprivation of Property\nFinally, plaintiff complains that the confiscation of his typewriter without compensation is\ntheft.  Plaintiff claims the typewriter was being used to file the grievances it โbecomes obvious the\nmotive for the confiscation.โ\nA claim that an individual has been deprived of property by a person acting under color of\nlaw states a claim for a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.  Deprivations of property by prison officials, however, even when intentional,\ndo not violate the due process clause so long as an adequate post-deprivation remedy exists.  See\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); see also Geiger v.\nJowers, 404 F.3d 3771, 374 (5th Cir. 2005) (concluding that plaintiff failed to state a claim\nregardless of whether the deprivation of property was the result of negligence or intentional\nmisconduct).  Texas provides such a remedy.  See Murphy v. Collins, 26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.\n1994) (holding that, in Texas, the tort of conversion is an adequate post-deprivation remedy);\nThompson v. Steele, 709 F.2d 381, 383 (5th  Cir. 1983) (holding that a state action for damages is\nan adequate remedy), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 897 (1983).  As a result, plaintiff has failed to establish\nhis constitutional rights were violated in connection with the deprivation of property.  Further,\nplaintiffโs claim of retaliation, as explained above, is speculative and conclusory.  Thus, plaintiffโs\nallegations are insufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Accordingly,\nplaintiffโs claims are frivolous and fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n15\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-TH-ZJH   Document 24   Filed 03/09/20   Page 16 of 16 PageID #:  172\nRecommendation\nThe defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.

Fiveash.\nThe court referred this matter to the Honorable Zack Hawthorn, United States Magistrate\nJudge, at Beaumont, Texas, for consideration pursuant to applicable laws and orders of this court. \nThe Magistrate Judge recommends that the defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted and\nplaintiffโs complaint be dismissed with prejudice.\nThe court has received and considered the Report and Recommendation of United States\nMagistrate Judge filed pursuant to such referral, along with the record and pleadings.  Plaintiff filed\nobjections to the Magistrate Judgeโs Report and Recommendation.  This requires a de novo review\nof the objections in relation to the pleadings and the applicable law.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b).  \nAfter careful de novo consideration, the court concludes plaintiffโs objections are without\nmerit.  For the reasons set forth in the Report, plaintiffโs claims fail to state a claim upon which relief\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-RC-ZJH   Document 28   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 4 PageID #:  189\nmay be granted and are frivolous.  Accordingly, the defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted\nand the case dismissed.\nPlaintiff paid the full filing fee in this prisoner civil rights action.  Accordingly, the\nMagistrate Judge ordered the Clerk of Court to deliver summonses to plaintiff so he could serve the\ndefendants. While plaintiff complains that the Magistrate Judge erred in asserting plaintiff is\nproceeding in forma pauperis when he paid the filing fee, such distinction does not immunize\nplaintiff from the dismissal of his claims pursuant to a motion to dismiss by the defendants or\ndismissal under  28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A which applies to all prisoner complaints even when the prisoner\nhas paid the required filing fee.  See Martin v. Scott, 156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir. 1998). \nAdditionally, to the extent plaintiff contends the Magistrate Judge erred by not conducting an\nevidentiary hearing to develop his complaint, his objection lacks merit.  In this case, the Magistrate\nJudge did not recommend dismissal of the case during his initial screening of the case.  Instead, the\ndefendants were served and filed a motion to dismiss seeking dismissal of plaintiffโs claims against\nthem. The Magistrate Judge entered a Report addressing the defendantsโ motion to dismiss and\nrecommending the defendantsโ motion be granted.  The court has liberally construed plaintiffโs\nallegations and the factual allegations have been taken as true and construed favorably to the\nplaintiff.  Plaintiffโs objection is without merit. \nPlaintiff also complains of his continued confinement in administrative segregation and his\nclassification as โhigh profileโ which makes him ineligible for placement in a diversion program. \nHowever, โ[i]t is well settled that the decision where to house inmates is at the core of prison\nadministratorsโ expertise.โ  McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 39 (2002); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S.\n215,  225  (1976).    โInmates  have  no  protectable  property  or  liberty  interest  in  custodial\n2\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-RC-ZJH   Document 28   Filed 05/05/20   Page 3 of 4 PageID #:  190\nclassifications.โ  Whitley v. Hunt, 158 F.3d 882, 889 (5th Cir. 1998).  Thus, plaintiff has no\nconstitutional right to be classified for release to general population.  Further, plaintiff has failed to\nshow prison administratorsโ decisions to continue his confinement in administrative segregation is\nnot related to legitimate penological interests based on his history of violence and escape.  As the\nMagistrate Judge observed, plaintiffโs record demonstrates he has a propensity to commit violent\ncrimes, as well as a history of possession and use of firearms, impersonating a public servant or\nsecurity officer, and escaping from custody on two separate occasions.  While plaintiff argues his\nadministrative segregation review hearings are not meaningful, plaintiff concedes he is receiving due\nprocess hearings on a regular basis.  Finally, plaintiffโs allegations fail to rise to the level of a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment with respect to either the conditions of his confinement or\nmedical care.  Plaintiffโs allegations against the named defendants fail to show the defendantsโ\nactions rose to the level of the deliberate indifference.  Plaintiff has failed to show the denial of a\nconstitutional right.  Accordingly, plaintiffโs allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief may\nbe granted.  \nPlaintiff also complains of the defendantsโ failure to follow prison rules and regulations. \nHowever, the failure to follow prison regulations, rules or procedures does not rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation.  Stanley v. Foster, 464 F.3d 565, 569 (5th Cir. 2006); Hernandez v. Estelle,\n788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1986).  Therefore, plaintiffโs allegations fail to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted.  \nAdditionally, plaintiff complains he was retaliated against by the defendants.  To state a valid\nclaim for retaliation, an inmate must prove โ(1) he was exercising a specific constitutional right, (2)\nthe defendant intended to retaliate against the inmate for exercising that right, (3) a retaliatory\n3\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-RC-ZJH   Document 28   Filed 05/05/20   Page 4 of 4 PageID #:  191\nadverse act occurred, and (4) causation.โ  Morris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2006).  To\nshow causation, an inmate must establish that โbut for the retaliatory motive the complained of\nincident ... would not have occurred.โ  Woods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir. 1995).  Mere\nconclusory allegations of retaliation will be insufficient to state a retaliation claim.  Id. \nIn this case, plaintiff has failed to show either a retaliatory motive or causation regarding his\nclaims against the defendants.  Plaintiffโs allegations of retaliation are conclusory and no more than\nmere speculation on the part of plaintiff.  Plaintiff has failed to produce either direct evidence of\nmotivation or allege a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.   Thus,\nplaintiff has failed to state a claim of retaliation under ยง 1983 against the defendants.  Accordingly,\nthe defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted.\nO R D E R\nFor the reasons set forth above, as well as in the Report of the Magistrate Judge, plaintiff has\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or are frivolous.

Polunsky Unit (โPolunskyโ) \nwhile Mr. Hope was housed there (โPolunsky Defendantsโ); (2) Defendants Leonard Echessa, Joni \nWhite, Kelly Enloe, Melissa Bennett, and Bonnie Fiveash, each part of the State Classification \nCommittee or classification review process (โClassification Defendantsโ); and (3) Defendants \nSimmons and Clark, both staff involved in the response to a medical incident that occurred while \nMr. Hope was at the O.B. Ellis Unit (โEllisโ and the โEllis Defendantsโ); each in their personal \ncapacity, and alleges as follows:\nINTRODUCTION \n1. For 27 years, Plaintiff Dennis Wayne Hope was confined in isolation for nearly \nevery hour of every day, often in inhumane and unsanitary conditions.  Prisoners housed in solitary \nconfinement1 face unique hardships within the prison system: they are cut off from the outside \nworld and kept in a small cell with little chance to feel or see sunlight, and without contact visits \nor phone calls with family or friends.  Those in solitary are cut off from the world within the prison \ntoo as they complete all daily activities, such as eating meals, by themselves and spend every hour \nof every day alone, with no chance to interact with a cell mate or other prisoners or participate in \nprison programming.\n2. The debilitating effects of solitary confinement, as compared to confinement in \nless-restrictive  settings,  are  well-established  and  widely  recognized  by  academics,  prison \nadministrators, and courts alike.  In fact, these effects are so well known that Justice Kennedy \n1 The terms โsolitary,โ โsolitary confinement,โ โsegregation,โ and โadministrative segregationโ (or \nโAd. Seg.โ or โSeg.โ) are used interchangeably throughout this Second Amended Complaint.\n1\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 9 of 80 PageID #: \n621\nconcluded that โ[y]ears on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.โ  Davis v. Ayala, 576 \nU.S. 257, 289 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Those researching the โterrible priceโ of \nsegregation have found the effects to be long lasting, with many prisoners experiencing post-\nrelease effects such as SHU Post-Release Syndrome2 and an increased risk of death.3  The United \nNations suggests solitary should be limited to no more than 15 days because longer segregation \nlikely amounts to torture.4  \n3. In  the  United  States,  anyone  housed  in  segregation  must  have  meaningful \nopportunities to have their placement reviewed.  See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 476, 477 n.9, \nabrogated on other grounds by Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995).  In light of this requirement, \nthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice (โTDCJโ) tasks the State Classification Committee \n(โSCCโ) with reviewing the classification of anyone in segregation at a โreview hearingโ every six \nmonths to determine whether to release such person back into general population (โG.P.โ).\n4. For 27 years, Mr. Hope endured the effects of segregation.  On top of the already-\ndevastating  effects  of  segregation,  however,  Mr.  Hope  suffered  the  additional  trauma  of \nmeaningless review hearings, of being told he would be released from solitary only to have that \ndecision overturned without warning, of being targeted by the system tasked with his safety for \ndaring to question how he could be released, and of being housed in moldy cells with other peopleโs \nfeces.\n2 Terry A. Kupers, The SHU Post-Release Syndrome: A Preliminary Report, 14 CORRECTIONAL \nMENTAL HEALTH REP. 6, 81 (Mar./Apr. 2016). \n3  Lauren  Brinkley-Rubinstein,  Josie  Sivaraman,  David  L.  Rosen,  Association  of  Restrictive \nHousing During Incarceration With Mortality After Release, 2 JAMA OPEN NETWORK 19 (Oct. 4, \n2019).\n4 See UN General Assembly, United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of \nPrisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules): Resolution / Adopted by the General Assembly, January 8, \n2016, A/RES/70/175, available at: https://www.refworld.org/docid/5698a3a44.html.\n2\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 10 of 80 PageID #:\n622\n5. Twelve years after Mr. Hope was placed in solitary confinement, the SCCโthe \nCommittee purportedly with the power and responsibility for reviewing housing classificationsโ\nfound that there was no justification for his continued segregation based on Mr. Hopeโs good \nbehavior, the fact that he was no longer designated as an escape risk, and the passage of so much \ntime.  Thus in 2007, the SCC decided to release Mr. Hope back to G.P.  However, a high-ranking \nTDCJ official, Robert Treon, who was still embarrassed by Mr. Hopeโs 1994 escape from a unit \nwhere Mr. Treon had been warden at the time, did not want Mr. Hope released to G.P.  Mr. Treon \nintervened to keep Mr. Hope in solitary, and Mr. Treon and a long-time colleague, Vanessa Jones, \nwho was then with the SCC, arranged to keep Mr. Hope in segregation for the foreseeable future.\n6. Three years later in 2010, after Mr. Treon had retired, SCC member Steven Rogers \nagain found there was no security need to keep Mr. Hope in solitary and again decided to release \nhim to G.P.  Like before, Ms. Jones inserted herself into the process, and the decision to release \nMr. Hope to G.P. was mysteriously overruled.  Concerned that the SCCโs decisions had been \noverruled twice, and unsure what grounds were being used to keep him in solitary or what he must \ndo to be released from segregation, Mr. Hope engaged in a number of protected First Amendment \nactivities, including filing grievances and writing letters to anyone he thought might be able to \nhelp or shine a light on his mistreatment.  Mr. Hope contacted SCC members such as Ms. Jones, \nClassification Defendants Echessa, White, and Enloe, other TDCJ officials, state legislators, and \nsometimes members of the media.  He asked outside advocates to do the same on his behalf.\n7. The  Classification  Defendants,  particularly  Ms.  White,  became  angered  with \nMr. Hope for persistently questioning how the SCC decisions to release him from solitary had \nbeen overturned outside of the available appeals process and who had authority to release him.  In \n3\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 11 of 80 PageID #:\n623\nresponse, the Classification Defendants hatched a plan to punish Mr. Hope for his advocacy by \nextending his time in solitary indefinitely, or at least until they changed their minds.\n8. The Classification Defendants unlawfully and perfunctorily denied Mr. Hopeโs \nrelease from solitary into G.P., both directly when Classification Defendants Enloe, Bennett, and \nFiveash were present at Mr. Hopeโs SCC review hearings, and when Classification Defendants \nWhite,  Enloe,  and  Bennett  directed  their  subordinates  to  deny  Mr.  Hopeโs  release  to  G.P. \nregardless of whether Mr. Hope posed a security risk necessitating such placement.  The structure \nand substance of these โhearingsโ broke with TDCJโs own policy and revealed the periodic review \nhearings to be nothing more than sham proceedings that frequently lasted no more than a few \nminutes.  In reality, the Classification Defendants had no intention of releasing Mr. Hope from \nsolitary confinement and the only purpose of the review hearings was to tell Mr. Hope he would \nremain segregated, frequently without stating any reason for the decisionโa fact SCC member \nTrevino admitted to Mr. Hope years later when he revealed Mr. Hopeโs review hearings were mere \nโwelfare checksโ and not intended to evaluate his classification.\n9. Again breaking with policy, the Classification Defendants disclaimed authority to \ntransfer Mr. Hope to G.P, each pointing their finger in a different direction but providing no \nexplanation for the inconsistency.  At various times, SCC members indicated to Mr. Hope that \nthey thought he should return to G.P. but claimed that either (1) their judgment was overridden \noutside of the SCC review hearing or (2) there was nothing they could do to put their judgment \ninto action.  Mr. Hope did not receive notice of the basis for these out-of-hearing reversals and had \nno meaningful opportunity to appeal or contest them.\n10. These improper review hearings led Mr. Hope to file grievances and contact \nofficials to question the review process.  Over time, Mr. Hope and his advocates challenged the \n4\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 12 of 80 PageID #:\n624\nlegitimacy of his review hearings with increasing frequency and to increasingly higher-level \nofficials within and outside the prison system.  Mr. Hope had proven his ability to bring outside \nattention to TDCJ before: in or around 2009, when one of Mr. Hopeโs advocates alerted then-Texas \nSenator Whitmire that Mr. Treon had housed Mr. Hope in death row at Polunsky, Senator \nWhitmire intervened on Mr. Hopeโs behalf to have TDCJ remove Mr. Hope from death row to a \ndifferent segregation housing section.  Now faced with the possibility that Mr. Hope again would \ncatch the attention of people at the highest levels of TDCJ or of someone outside of TDCJ, the \nClassification Defendants expanded their agreement into a multifaceted scheme whereby they \nattempted  to  silence  Mr.  Hope  and  his  advocates.    They  also  arranged  for  manufactured \ndisciplinary charges against Mr. Hope to provide a ready-made excuse to parrot to Mr. Hope, his \nadvocates, and anyone else who asked why Mr. Hope was still segregated.\n11. To manufacture the disciplinary charges against Mr. Hope and make his daily life \nincreasingly uncomfortable, the Classification Defendants needed to work with a Polunsky officer.  \nThey found willing participants, first in Major Virgil McMullen and later in Polunsky Defendant \nMajor  Rehse.    The  coordinated  acts  of  retaliation  against  Mr.  Hope  by  the  Classification \nDefendants, Polunsky Defendant Rehse, and co-conspirator Mr. McMullen, included:\n๏ท Improperly confiscating Mr. Hopeโs typewriter (which the confiscating officer did \nwhile taunting Mr. Hope that he would need to find a new way to type his \ngrievances without it);\n๏ท Unnecessarily destroying contact information for several of Mr. Hopeโs outside \nadvocates through whom he magnified his voice (and leaving no record of such \nconfiscation on the property report);\n5\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 13 of 80 PageID #:\n625\n๏ท Planting a screwdriver in Mr. Hopeโs cell and then dispatching officers to retrieve \nit, leading to a fabricated disciplinary charge for possession of a weapon and the \nforeseeable use of force via chemical agent against Mr. Hope to retrieve such \nโweaponโ;\n๏ท Leaving Mr. Hope naked and covered in chemicals for days with no way to clean \nhimself and with no clothing or blankets in February;\n๏ท Instituting a โpolicyโ of frequent cell moves where Mr. Hope was shuffled between \ncells more than 260 times in a six-year period and regularly exposed to unsanitary \nand toxic conditions; and\n๏ท Repeatedly denying Mr. Hopeโs release from segregation back into G.P. without a \npenological or security purpose and without due process safeguards.\n12. After 2012, when Mr. Hope was repeatedly moved between cells for no apparent \npurpose, his new cells were often unsanitary and in various states of disrepair.  Some of Mr. Hopeโs \ncells had leaks, broken lights, and unpredictable temperatures.  Even more often, they had not been \ncleaned before Mr. Hope was housed in them, exposing Mr. Hope to mold, feces, urine, vomit, \nand other unsanitary filth, made worse by the lack of proper cleaning supplies made available to \nhim.\n13. As Mr. Hope continuously challenged his mistreatment and pleaded for his release \nto G.P., Polunsky Defendant Rehse and various Classification Defendants made references to \nMr. Hopeโs outside advocates, telling Mr. Hope it did not matter how hard he foughtโhe was \nstaying in solitary confinement.  \n14. This mistreatment continued even after Mr. Treon, the original official who had \nblocked Mr. Hopeโs release to G.P. in 2007, later made a personal call to the Director of \n6\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 14 of 80 PageID #:\n626\nClassifications on Mr. Hopeโs behalf stating that Mr. Treon was not opposed to Mr. Hopeโs release.  \nShockingly, when Mr. Treon asked her if Mr. Hope would ever be allowed out of solitary \nconfinement, the Director of Classification admitted out loud what was supposed to be kept under \nwraps:  โOh no, heโll never get out of Seg.โ5\n15. And the Classification Defendants may have been right, that they never would have \nlet Mr. Hope out of segregation, except that they abruptly changed positions in an attempt to moot \nMr. Hopeโs certiorari petition to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Only upon the filing of \nthat petition was Mr. Hope finally, after nearly three decades, released from segregation to G.P.  \nThis ordeal did not leave Mr. Hope unscathed.  By plotting and executing a retaliatory scheme, by \nhousing him in inhumane conditions, and by discarding him into an indefinite segregation, the \nPolunsky and Classification Defendants caused enormous and irreparable damage to Mr. Hope.\n16. Once out of solitary, Mr. Hope was sent to a transitional program at the Ellis Unit, \nwhere officials made clear upon his arrival that he would be singled out and watched more closely \nthan other prisoners at the same unit.  During Mr. Hopeโs short time at this unit, the Ellis \nDefendants caused permanent damage to Mr. Hopeโs wrists by exerting excessive force when they \nintentionally applied and maintained overly tightened restraints to Mr. Hope while he was being \ntreated at a hospital for respiratory distress in May 2022. \n17. In June 2022, Mr. Hope was transferred to G.P. at the John B. Connally Unit \n(โConnallyโ), where he is still housed today while fighting to rectify years of unconstitutional \ntreatment at Defendantsโ hands.\n5 The Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinement, AL JAZEERA (June 27, 2023) at 13:32-14:48, \nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/program/fault-lines/2023/6/27/the-box-27-years-in-solitary-\nconfinement (โThe Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinementโ).\n7\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 15 of 80 PageID #:\n627\nPARTIES \n18.

MR. HOPE WAS CONFINED TO SEGREGATION FOR 27 YEARS AFTER \nBEING DESIGNATED AN ESCAPE RISK IN 1995\n30. Mr. Hope was initially placed in segregation in February 1995 when TDCJ officials \nplaced an escape risk designation in his file following a 1994 escape from a TDCJ facility.  Mr. \nHope was 26 years old at the time.  \n11\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 19 of 80 PageID #:\n631\n31. For the next 27 years, from 1995 until 2022, Mr. Hope was confined to a 9-foot by \n6-foot cell.  After accounting for fixtures in the cell, Mr. Hope had a mere nine square feet of space \nin which to move around.  Initially, Mr. Hope was housed in the same cell for extended lengths of \ntime, being moved to a new cell only on infrequent occasions.  By 2012, however, Mr. Hope began \ngetting shuffled from cell to cell, often being moved multiple times a week.  Regardless of what \ncell he was placed in, each was approximately the size of a compact parking space, and he was \nalways alone.\n32. Isolation defined Mr. Hopeโs daily life.  In fact, Mr. Hope was 53 years old when \nreleased from segregation to G.P., meaning he had spent over half of his lifetime (including nearly \nall of his adult life) in isolation, deprived of meaningful human contact, mental stimulus, physical \nactivity, and human dignity.\n33. According to TDCJ policy, Mr. Hope could participate in only limited and isolated \nrecreation outside of his cell, his only time outdoors.  He was allowed either one hour of recreation \nper day seven days per week, or two hours per day five days per weekโthat is, he was generally \nnot allowed more than 10 hours per week outside of his cell for these 27 years.  Moreover, because \nof a number of factors, such as weather, unit-wide lockdowns, and staff shortages, Mr. Hope \nfrequently went days, weeks, or even months without recreation (or sunlight).  During such \nperiods, he spent 24 hours per day completely alone in his cell.\n34. Besides recreation, all of Mr. Hopeโs daily activities took place in his solitary cell.  \nHe ate every meal alone, from an often-dirty tray passed through a low, narrow slot in the cell \ndoor.  Even health checks were conducted in his cell, with his sanity and well-being assessed from \nthe opposite side of his cellโs steel doorโand in earshot of the rest of the housing section.  \n12\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 20 of 80 PageID #:\n632\nMr. Hope did everythingโate meals, read and wrote letters, prepared legal documents, and passed \ntimeโsitting on the cellโs thin bed or floor or while standing.\n35. The only consistent physical human contact Mr. Hope experienced throughout \nthese 27 years in solitary confinement was with prison guards as they strip searched his body, \nsearched (or ransacked) his cell, or handcuffed him through the low door slot.  Mr. Hope was \nprohibited from contact visits, and from 1995 until approximately August 2020, was allowed only \na single phone call, after his mother died.  Mr. Hope could not socialize with other prisoners or \nparticipate in religious or vocational activities. \n36. Mr. Hopeโs conditions of confinement in segregation differed notably from those \nin G.P.  In G.P., prisoners could socialize with others in the unit, eat in groups and at a table, work \na job, make personal phone calls, watch television, and participate in prison programming.  \nMr. Hope was strip searched regularly in solitary, often four times per day; in contrast, he would \nhave experienced pat downs in G.P.  G.P. also experienced fewer lockdowns, which meant fewer \nโjohnnieโs,โ the bagged meals provided instead of cooked meals during such periods. \n37. Being kept in segregation restricted Mr. Hopeโs access to property and legal \nmaterials.  Prisoners in segregation are allowed to possess far less propertyโincluding reading \nmaterial, clothing, pictures, and other personal itemsโthan their G.P. counterparts.  And while \nthose in G.P. are allowed to research in the law library and to check out entire books, Mr. Hope \nwas only permitted to request legal materials three cases at a time and only three times per week \n(or less, depending on holiday and staffing schedules).  These restrictions impaired his access to \nthe courts, including in advance of filing his pro se complaint in this case.\n13\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 21 of 80 PageID #:\n633\nII. THE PROCESS USED TO REVIEW MR. HOPEโS SEGREGATION WAS \nREPEATEDLY INTERFERED WITH, RENDERING IT MEANINGLESS\n38. As  detailed  below,  Mr.  Hope  was  entitled  to  have  his  placement  in  solitary \nconfinement reviewed by the SCC.  After the Security Precautions Designator Review Committee \n(โSPDRCโ) found Mr. Hope was no longer an escape risk, the SCC decided at an April 2007 \nreview hearing to return Mr. Hope to G.P.  This decision made sense, as the SCC reviews the same \nprisoner file that the SPDRC reviews.  Yet the SCCโs decision was inexplicably overruledโ\nreportedly by Mr. Treon in โadministration,โโand then all record of the April review mysteriously \ndisappeared from Mr. Hopeโs file when he appeared before SCC member Jones, who agreed to \ndefer to Mr. Treon.  A similar pattern repeated in 2010 when the SCC again decided to release \nMr. Hope to G.P., but again the decision was reversed outside of the proper appeals processโand \nagain due to interference from then SCC Chair Jones.\nA. Mr. Hope Was Entitled To Meaningful Reviews Of His Segregation \nPlacement\n39. Mr. Hope, like all TDCJ prisoners in solitary confinement, was entitled to a review \nhearing  before  the  SCC  every  180  days  (i.e.,  every  six  months)  to  have  his  placement  in \nsegregation reviewed for potential release into G.P.  \n40. SCC review hearings are conducted by (1) a representative of the SCC, (2) the \nwarden or designee, and (3) other staff (e.g., medical or building staff) as deemed appropriate.  \nUpon  information  and  belief,  although  the  warden  and  other  staff  are  present,  the  SCC \nrepresentative has final decision-making authority at an SCC review hearing.\n41. Prior to a review hearing, a prisoner has the right to receive notice of the hearing, \nincluding of any specified reasons for their continued placement in solitary.  Prisoners have the \nright to attend the review hearing (unless they pose a threat to security), to give their own \nstatement, and to submit written witness statements and other documentary evidence.\n14\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 22 of 80 PageID #:\n634\n42. Such evidence is supposed to form the basis for the SCCโs decision about whether \ncontinued solitary placement is justified, along with considerations regarding whether the prisoner \nbeing reviewed โwould still be: [a] current escape risk; [a] physical threat to staff or other \noffenders; [or a] threat to the order and security of the prison as evidenced by repeated, serious \ndisciplinary violations.โ8  In that assessment, the SCC must evaluate a variety of factors related to \nthe  prisonerโs  time  in  segregation,  including  disciplinary  violations  (and  their  severity  and \nfrequency), medical evaluations, relationships with other prisoners and staff, participation in \nprograms, and the prisonerโs desire to remain in or stated readiness to leave segregation.\n43. The SCC โmakes final decisions regarding administrative segregation.โ9  And after \na review hearing, the SCC is to provide the prisoner with โa written decision stating the reasons \nfor the decisions and summarizing the information presented and considered.โ10  Prisoners have \nthe right to appeal the SCCโs final decisions through the grievance process.  A warden may also \nchallenge a SCC decision by appealing to the Departmental Review Board, which hears the appeal \nand issues a decision.11\nB. In 2005, TDCJ Removed Mr. Hopeโs Escape Risk Designation \n44. From 1995, when Mr. Hope was first placed in solitary, until 2005, the SCC based \nits decision to keep Mr. Hope in segregation on his โescape riskโ designator.  However, in 2005, \n8 TDCJ Administrative Segregation Plan (March 2012) at 17, 30 (emphasis added), available at \nhttps://tifa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Administrative-Segregation-Death-Row-Plan-1.pdf \n(the โAd. Seg. Planโ).  The 2012 plan superseded the 2005 plan, which, upon information and \nbelief, outlined the same substantive criteria to be considered at SCC review hearings (emphasis \nadded).\n9  TDCJ  Offender  Orientation  Handbook  at  7  (Feb.  2017),  available  at \nhttps://www.tdcj.texas.gov/documents/Offender_Orientation_Handbook_English.pdf\n10 Ad. Seg. Plan at 17.\n11 Ad. Seg. Plan at 31.\n15\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 23 of 80 PageID #:\n635\nthe SPDRC removed this designator from Mr. Hopeโs file, indicating that the escapeโmore than \na decade earlierโcould no longer justify keeping him in solitary.  Its removal reflected a judgment \nthat, after 10 years in solitary without any escape attempt, neither Mr. Hopeโs behavior nor other \ncircumstances indicated that Mr. Hope still posed an escape risk.  Because this designator was the \nreason Mr. Hope was placed in segregation, and because there was no evidence that Mr. Hope \npresented a physical threat or of repeated serious disciplinary violations, its removal sent a \nsignificant message: TDCJ no longer had a valid security interest in keeping Mr. Hope from being \nreleased to G.P.\nC. In 2007, The SCC Decided Mr. Hope โShallโ Be Released From Solitary, But \nThat Decision Was Reversed Without Explanation\n45. On or around April 4, 2007, with no escape risk designator in his file, and 12 years \nsince his placement in solitary, the SCC decided to release Mr. Hope to G.P.  SCC member Steven \nRogers communicated this decision to Mr. Hope at the review hearing and recorded it on the SCC \nReview Hearing Record, checking the box for โThe offender shall [] [b]e released to General \nPopulation.โ  Under the section for โthe basis for Committee decision,โ Mr. Rogers checked the \nbox for โOtherโโall other options provide reasons to hold someone in solitary, with no prefilled \noptions providing bases for releaseโand wrote in that it had been 12 years since his escape, he no \nlonger had an escape risk designator, and Mr. Hope displayed a โgood attitude.โ\n46. Despite what was decided at the SCC review hearing and recorded on the form, \nMr. Hope was not released from segregation to G.P. in 2007 and instead was transferred to \nsegregation at the Polunsky Unit.  Upon information and belief, this change was made based on \ninstructions from Regional Director Robert Treon, who had been the warden of the unit from which \nMr. Hope had escaped years earlier, and who now had oversight of the Polunsky Unitโwhere Mr. \n16\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 24 of 80 PageID #:\n636\nHope would be housed with those on death row.12  Mr. Treon has since explained in a 2023 \ninterview with the media that for years he was embarrassed by Mr. Hopeโs escape.13\n47. When Mr. Hope grieved this unexpected change, Polunsky Assistant Warden Billy \nHirsch told Mr. Hope: โYou were transferred by State Classification to the Polunsky Unit with \ninstructions that you remain in security detention.  You will remain in Administrative Segregation \nuntil State Classification changes your status.โ  However, when Mr. Hope followed up with Major \nNelson, who was responsible for cell assignments in Polunskyโs segregation unit, Ms. Nelson \nresponded that she had not received a copy of the April 4, 2007 SCC Review Hearing Record, but \nthat she was told by Mr. Rogers that his decision to release Mr. Hope to G.P. was โoverturned by \nthe Administration,โ and consequently, Mr. Hope would remain in solitary confinement.\nD. Mr. Hope Expressed His Concerns To The SCC And TDCJ Officials\n48. Following the administrationโs surprise reversal, Mr. Hope repeatedly contacted \nMr. Rogers, other SCC members, and TDCJ officials asking why the SCCโs decision was not \nupheld and what he must do in order to be released from solitary to G.P.  Mr. Hope had his outside \nadvocates also contact Mr. Rogers, including in or about January 2008.\n49. Resulting from this letter campaign, SCC member Rogers communicated to one of \nMr. Hopeโs advocates that Mr. Treon would never allow Mr. Hope to be released from solitary to \nG.P., so Mr. Hope would need to wait until Mr. Treon left TDCJ.  Despite the SPDRC finding that \nMr. Hope posed no escape risk, Mr. Treon had reportedly convinced Mr. Rogers that Mr. Rogers \nwould be held responsible if Mr. Hope were released to G.P. only to escape again.  Mr. Hope also \n12 A warden may challenge an SCC decision by adhering to a defined process.  See Ad. Seg. Plan \nat 31.  Upon information and belief, in the instances when the SCCโs decision to release Mr. Hope \nto G.P. were overturned, no such challenges or appeals had occurred.  \n13 The Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinement, at 6:34.\n17\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 25 of 80 PageID #:\n637\nexpressed his concerns directly to Mr. Treon, including in letters sent in or about June 2007 and \nJanuary 2008. \nE. The SCC โLostโ Its Copy Of The 2007 Decision Approving Mr. Hopeโs \nRelease To General Population \n50. Then-SCC member Vanessa Jones conducted Mr. Hopeโs next SCC review hearing \nonly three months later, on or about July 13, 2007, instead of at the regular 6-month interval.  \nMr. Hope asked Ms. Jones why he was being reviewed again so soon, and he showed her his copy \nof the April 4, 2007 Review Hearing Record for his release to G.P.  She acted surprised to see he \nhad been reviewed recently.  Ms. Jones claimed his file had no record of the April review or release \ndecision and asked Mr. Hope for his copy.  Mr. Hope offered to let her photocopy it in his presence \nbut declined to give up his only copy of the paperwork.  Mr. Rogers later admitted to Mr. Hope \nand his advocate that Mr. Rogers had torn up the SCCโs copy of his release form based on \nMr. Treonโs instruction not to leave a paper trail.\n51. Upon information and belief, Ms. Jonesโs attempt to take Mr. Hopeโs copy of his \nApril form was intended to serve the same purpose.  Ms. Jones had a close relationship with \nMr. Treon; she had come up through TDCJ under Mr. Treon and had worked closely with him as \nhis Unit Classification Chief when Mr. Treon was Warden at the now-Polunsky Unit.  And \nMs. Jonesโs agreement to uphold Mr. Treonโs wishes was further reinforced when she told \nMr. Hope at the July 2007 review hearing that she would not release him to G.P. without first \ngiving Mr. Treon the option to speak with Mr. Hope and approve the decision.\n52. Like Mr. Rogers, other SCC members at subsequent review hearings echoed this \nfear of repercussions if they were to release Mr. Hope to G.P.  For example, SCC member Maryann \nComstock expressed a willingness to release Mr. Hope to G.P. but for a note in his file indicating \nSCC members should consult Mr. Treon before releasing Mr. Hope.\n18\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 26 of 80 PageID #:\n638\nF. Administrators Dangled A Release From SolitaryโIf Mr. Hope Behaved \nWith The Media\n53. Mr. Hope spoke with Mr. Treon in or around October 2009.  At the time, Mr. Hope \nhad recently been interviewed for a documentary program โBreakoutโ on โRaw TVโ about his \ntime in solitary.  The film was set to air on the National Geographic channel for the first time in \nthe coming days.  Mr. Treon said he would release Mr. Hope from solitary to G.P. after the filmโs \nrelease if Mr. Hope had not said anything that โsounded crazyโ during his interview.  However, \nMr. Treon did not speak to Mr. Hope again prior to Mr. Treonโs retirement from TDCJ.\nG. In 2010, The SCC Again Decided Mr. Hope โShallโ Be Released To General \nPopulationโYet Again Mr. Hope Was Left In Solitary Indefinitely \n54. In January of 2010, after Mr. Treon retired, Mr. Rogers again decided at an SCC \nreview hearing to release Mr. Hope from solitary to G.P, and again noted his decision on the SCC \nReview Hearing Record.  Two correctional officers confirmed to Mr. Hope that they understood \nhe was being released to G.P.  Yet, again, the SCCโs decision was changed without explanation or \nopportunity for meaningful appeal when Vanessa Jones, then SCC Chair, intervened.\n55. On or around February 23, 2010, a sergeant informed Mr. Hope that he would not \nbe released to G.P., notwithstanding the SCCโs January decision.  Mr. Hope filed a grievance \nasking for an explanation.  In April, Mr. Hope received a response to his grievance stating that the \nSCC ChairโMs. Jonesโhad reversed the SCCโs January decision to release him from solitary to \nG.P. \n56. Upon information and belief, prior to Mr. Hopeโs next review hearing, Ms. Jones \ncontacted several SCC members and mandated they keep Mr. Hope in segregation.  For example, \nin or around July 2010, at his next SCC review hearing, SCC member Lovelady explained that she \nhad spoken to Ms. Jones who had instructed her to keep Mr. Hope in solitary.\n19\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 27 of 80 PageID #:\n639\n57. In August 2010, Ms. Jones responded to a letter Mr. Hope had sent her in or around \nMarch 2010 regarding her reversal of the SCCโs January 2010 release decision.  Ms. Jones \nattempted to justify overturning the decision, writing to Mr. Hope that although his escape risk \ndesignation had been removed because of the length of time that had elapsed without incident, his \ncase was still considered โunusual and difficult,โ and she would not implement SCC review \nhearing decisions for his release without additional approval by the Chair or Vice-Chair of \nClassification and Records.  Mr. Hope was not given an explanation for how or why this \nundocumented characterization was applied to his case or what must be done to have it removed, \nor whether the Chair or Vice-Chair of Classification and Records had even been asked to approve \nthe SCCโs January release decision.  Neither was he allowed to challenge the application of this \ncharacterization to his case.  Mr. Hope again sent letters to the SCC, including to Ms. Jones and \nthe Chair of Classification and Records.\nIII. THE CLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS ENTERED A CONSPIRACY TO \nRETALIATE AGAINST MR. HOPE\n58. By 2011, the SCC had twice decided to release Mr. Hope from solitary to G.P.โ\nand twice those decisions were reversed after the fact without explanation.  As explained further \nbelow, Mr. Hope was outspoken in challenging these reversals and other issues he had with his \nreview process, and his and his advocatesโ communications were met with resistance.  What had \nstarted out as interference from Mr. Treon, and then progressed to Ms. Jones ceding authority to \nMr. Treon, now became an agreement to retaliate against Mr. Hope for his protected activities.  \nNow as SCC Chair, Ms. Jones spent most of her time in Huntsville at administrative headquarters, \nwhere the Classification Defendants were also based at overlapping times.  From behind closed \ndoors, Ms. Jones and the Classification Defendants emerged with a single, unified response:  Mr. \nHope was to remain in solitary indefinitelyโor at least until the group changed its mind.\n20\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 28 of 80 PageID #:\n640\n59. This agreement began a years-long pattern in which various members of the SCC \nvacillated at review hearings between sometimes disclaiming any authority whatsoever to release \nMr. Hope to G.P., and other times assuring him he would be released to G.P., only for that decision \nto be inexplicably reversed with no meaningful opportunity to appeal.  Regardless of the position \nthey took, the result was the same: Mr. Hope was left in segregation indefinitely with no guidance \non what he could do to be released back to G.P. or who had the authority to make such a decision.\n60. Going  forward  after  his  2010  review  hearings,  Mr.  Hope  prepared  written \nstatements that he brought to and submitted at each of his subsequent SCC review hearings, in \naddition to continuing to send letters to the SCC and classification officials.  Oftentimes, however, \nthe single SCC member who attended the review hearing failed to even read the letter.  Instead, at \nmost of Mr. Hopeโs review hearings, an SCC member would begin by announcing that he would \nremain in solitary confinement.  Only then would the SCC member ask Mr. Hope if he wanted to \nmake a statement.  Mr. Hopeโs review hearing in or about January 2014 before Classification \nDefendant Fiveash provides an example.  Mr. Hope submitted a written statement but, Ms. Fiveash \ndid not consider it and marked the box that he had submitted nothing for consideration.  As a result \nof these predetermined results, Mr. Hope spent another 12 years in solitary confinement, without \nany meaningful process by which to have his status reviewed.\n61. At several review hearings, SCC members disclaimed any ability to review or \nrelease Mr. Hope from segregation.  For example, at one such review hearing on or around June \n11, 2015, SCC member Armstrong told Mr. Hope, in sum or substance, simply that โthereโs \nnothing I can do for you.โ  SCC member Sheila Leblanc told Mr. Hope she had no problem with \nhim being in G.P. but did not want responsibility for the decision herself.\n21\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 29 of 80 PageID #:\n641\n62. Other SCC members claimed someone else had authority over whether to release \nMr. Hope to G.P., despite those other officials never being present at the review hearings.  For \nexample, SCC member Bilnoski told Mr. Hope he would have released Mr. Hope, but an \nunidentified administrative committee had just reviewed Mr. Hope, and Mr. Bilnoski could not \noverrule their determination.\n63. On a rare occasion when Mr. Hope appeared at a review hearing before someone \nwilling to actually review him, such as in or around June 2014 before SCC member Buckner, Ms. \nBuckner decided to release Mr. Hope to G.P., but then mysteriously changed her mind a week after \nreturning to Huntsville.\n64. Mr. Hope received different treatment than other prisoners in solitary, including \nsome who also had previous escapes.  In fact, one of the two prisoners who had escaped with Mr. \nHope in 1994 was released to G.P. in approximately 2004 (just before Mr. Hopeโs escape risk \ndesignator was removed), and the second was released several years laterโfacts Mr. Hope pointed \nout to the SCC and Classification Defendants in his letters.  SCC members Bilnoski and Rogers \nonce had Mr. Hope brought to them outside the confines of an official review hearing, further \nindicating that Mr. Hope was being discussed outside the regular review process. \nA. The Grievance Process Provided No Meaningful Opportunity For Appeal\n65. Unable to get answers from the SCC and unsure what more he could do to be \nreleased to G.P., or to ensure he was at least reviewed by someone with the authority to make \nrelease decisions, Mr. Hope continued to pursue any options available to him.  One such avenue \nwas through the grievance process.  A prisoner can appeal an SCC review hearing decision by \nfiling a grievance.  Mr. Hope did so, including in or around July 2011 and multiple subsequent \ntimes in the years since.  He filed grievances related to SCC review hearings conducted by \n22\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 30 of 80 PageID #:\n642\nClassification Defendants Bennett, Enloe, and Fiveash, where Mr. Hope challenged the review \nhearing process and explained the SCCโs apparent lack of authority.\n66. The problem, however, was that the filed grievances were responded to by unit \nofficials, not by SCC members or classification officials with authority over the SCC process.  In \none representative response to such grievances, a warden told Mr. Hope that his release was โat \nthe discretion of the State Classification officeโ and that Mr. Hope would โneed to discuss the \nissue during [his] next State classification hearing.โ  Mr. Hope received similar responses from the \nTDCJ Office of the Independent Ombudsman, including in or around November 2015.\n67. In practical terms, this pattern meant that Mr. Hopeโs โappealsโ never reached \nanyone with authority to review or change the outcome.  Unit officials insisted that only the SCC \nhad the ability to release Mr. Hope to G.P., but SCC official after SCC official insisted they did \nnot have the necessary authority.  Thus, no actual process for release was available to Mr. Hope. \nB. The Classification Defendants Grew Angry With Mr. Hopeโs Outreach\n68. Another avenue Mr. Hope pursued was through his letters, which he and his \nadvocates sent increasingly often and to increasingly higher-ranking officialsโeven to people \noutside of TDCJ who Mr. Hope thought might be able to help. \n69. In 2011, for example, Mr. Hope sent letters to the SCC, SCC member Jones, and \nTDCJ Deputy Director Thomas Prasifka, among others.  In these and other letters, Mr. Hope \nexpressed his concerns with his SCC review hearings and the lack of clarity regarding who had \nthe authority to release him to G.P., disclosed how solitary was causing or contributing to medical \nissues with his heart, cholesterol, and back, and explained how being denied release to G.P. meant \nhe would not be paroled despite otherwise being eligible.\n70. His letter writing campaign continued in subsequent years as well, with additional \ncommunications directed to both specific SCC members and to the SCC generally, and to \n23\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 31 of 80 PageID #:\n643\nClassification Defendants White, Enloe, and Echessa, and others with roles in or oversight of \nclassifications and the review process.  Mr. Hope also wrote to officials outside the prison system, \nincluding  multiple  letters  to  then-Texas  Senator  John  Whitmire,  hoping  the  Senator  could \ninvestigate or speak to someone at TDCJ on his behalf.\n71. Outside advocatesโoften at Mr. Hopeโs request or with his permission, although \noccasionally on their own and without his knowledgeโdid the same through letters and phone \ncalls.  These communications were on matters of significant public concernโthe treatment of \nthose in our criminal justice system and the operation of Texas prisons generallyโas well as \nMr. Hopeโs treatment specifically.  Advocates wrote letters to Classification Defendants White, \nEnloe, and Echessa, and others both at TDCJ and outside of the system, and made calls and spoke \nwith officials, including Classification Defendants White and Echessa.  As email became an \nincreasingly preferred form of communication, Mr. Hope drafted messages on his typewriter or by \nhand, which he then mailed to his advocates to send as emails to officials on his behalf.  When \npossible, Mr. Hopeโs advocates spoke with officials in person, either at Polunsky or at TDCJ \nmeetings open to the public.\n72. Mr. Hope had followed protocol, was typically at the highest level of privileges \nwithin segregation due to good behavior and minimal disciplinary infractions, and completed every \neducational program available to him, but the SCC seemed determined to hold him to a shifting \nstandard, without explaining what that standard entailed.  Mr. Hope did not know what else he was \nrequired to do to be released to G.P., and he could not find anyone willing to provide an answer.\n73. SCC and classification officials often took more than a month to respond to \nMr. Hopeโs letters and those of his advocatesโif they bothered to respond at all.  At times, Mr. \nHope had to send repetitive letters to the same person following up on a single question in order \n24\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 32 of 80 PageID #:\n644\nto receive a response.  Other times, he and his advocates received only generic responses to their \noutreach and had to send additional messages repeating their questions that the official had failed \nto answer in their stock response.  Still other times, Mr. Hope and his advocates resorted to \ncontacting the TDCJ Ombudsmanโs Office pleading for help because too many of their calls and \nmessages to the SCC and classification had gone unanswered (although this proved futile as the \nOmbudsmanโs Office would only refer them to the SCC for classification-related questions).\n74. When Classification Defendants did respond, they often made clear that they found \nMr. Hopeโs outreach to be bothersome and discouraged him and his advocates from continuing to \ncontact them.  For example, in response to one advocate who reached out to Classification \nDefendant White at Mr. Hopeโs request regarding SCC members disclaiming authority to make \nrelease decisions, Ms. White expressed that it was unnecessary for anyone to contact her again.  \nSimilarly, at an SCC review hearing where Classification Defendant Enloe claimed to have been \nsent by Ms. White, Ms. Enloe told Mr. Hope that his and his advocatesโ outreach efforts would not \nget him out of segregation.\nC. Mr. Hope Upset Officers By Questioning Improper Disciplinary Cases\n75. In or around October 2011, the recently promoted then-Major Virgil McMullen \nsuddenly banned razor blades in Mr. Hopeโs building.  Loose razor blades had long been allowed \nfor their multiple legitimate uses, such as shaving, cutting food, sharpening pencils, and trimming \ntoenails.  Under the secret new rule (which applied only to Mr. Hopeโs building), possession of \nloose razor blades was suddenly prohibited.  Upon information and belief, Mr. McMullen designed \nthe change, at least in part, to issue possession of weapon disciplinary cases to prisoners in solitary, \nmaking them appear more dangerous and making it harder for them to be released to G.P.\n76. Unsurprisingly,  when  Mr.  McMullen  instructed  Officer  Tatum  to  search \nMr. Hopeโs cell in or about mid-October 2011 (just a week after Mr. Hopeโs advocatesโ most recent \n25\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 33 of 80 PageID #:\n645\nletter to Deputy Director Prasifka), Mr. Tatum found five loose razor bladesโeach previously \nissued to Mr. Hope by officers and in his possession for some time.  Because Mr. McMullen \ninstructed Mr. Tatum to issue possession of weapon cases rather than lesser, possession of \ncontraband cases, Mr. Hope received a serious charge, despite not having demonstrated an intent \nto use the loose razors as weapons (as is required for a possession of weapon charge).  \n77. On or about October 28, 2011, an unusually brief few days after the incident, \nCaptain Virgil Miller heard Mr. Hopeโs disciplinary case and entered a finding for possession of a \nweapon.  The offense impacted Mr. Hopeโs privileges level in solitary and his parole eligibility.\n78. Mr. Hope filed a grievance about this excessive charge (which was denied at Step 1 \nand Step 2 reviews) and wrote a letter to Polunskyโs warden.  Because of his letter, the Warden \nscheduled a meeting among himself, Mr. Hope, Mr. McMullen, and Mr. Miller.  At the meeting, \nMr. Miller admitted he had found Mr. Hope guilty of possession of a weapon because Mr. \nMcMullen had instructed him to do so.  The Warden agreed Mr. McMullen had overstepped but \nsaid there was nothing he could do because Mr. Hopeโs grievance had already been denied.\n79. Years later, Mr. Hope discovered another avenue for challenging this charge.  Still \nconcerned about the severe implications of a guilty finding of โpossession of weaponโ on his \nrecord, Mr. Hope wrote to Regional Director of Discipline Amy Oliver.  In or around September \n2015, Ms. Oliver ultimately agreed to reduce the charge to possession of contraband, as the \nincident did not meet the definition of possession of a weapon.  As a lesser offense, possession of \ncontraband could not be used as a justification to keep Mr. Hope (or anyone) in solitary.\nIV. THE CLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS EXPANDED THEIR AGREEMENT TO \nSEGREGATE MR. HOPE INDEFINITELY, AND TRIED TO SHIELD \nTHEMSELVES FROM SCRUTINY \n80. Mr. Hope had communicated extensivelyโusing all means available to him from \nhis solitary cell as well as working through outside advocates with greater abilities to amplify his \n26\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 34 of 80 PageID #:\n646\nvoiceโand the message to the Classification Defendants was clear: Mr. Hope was, and would \ncontinue, challenging his indefinite segregation, bringing awareness to flaws in his review process \nand seeking an explanation as to how he could be kept in solitary for years on end with no escape \nrisk designator and with largely clean disciplinary records.  Mr. Hope and his advocates were \nunsatisfied with the stock responses being given to them and demanded more.  This challenge \nmeant that Mr. McMullenโs sensationalized possession of weapons case came at the perfect time \nfor the Classification Defendantsโ needs: it provided a concrete example to which they could point \nas a justification for why Mr. Hope remained in segregation.  Indeed, SCC members brought up \nthis โmajorโ disciplinary offense at future SCC review hearings as an excuse to deny Mr. Hopeโs \nrelease to G.P., and the incident was cited by the Classification Defendants in responses to \nMr. Hopeโs advocates as the purported justification for keeping Mr. Hope in segregation.\n81. Still, even a possession of weapons case could not justify keeping Mr. Hope in \nsolitary forever.  The Classification Defendants needed yet another, more egregious, pretext to \nkeep Mr. Hope in solitary and to immunize themselves from the scrutiny caused by Mr. Hopeโs \ncontinuously  contacting  TDCJ  officials  who  outranked  them,  state  legislators,  and  media \nmembers.  Mr. McMullen would again provide that cover just two months later.\nA. Major  McMullen  Provided  The  Classification  Defendants  With  Another \nExcuse To Keep Mr. Hope In Segregation\n82. By 2012, word had spread that Mr. McMullen did not like Mr. Hope.  For example, \nafter the meeting with the warden and Mr. McMullen about the loose razors, Mr. Hope heard from \nan officer assigned to his housing area that Mr. McMullen was โnot happyโ that Mr. Hope had \nchallenged his authority and written grievances about Mr. McMullenโs policies.  Similarly, \nMr. Hope was told by a different officer that Mr. McMullen โhatedโ Mr. Hope because of how \n27\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 35 of 80 PageID #:\n647\nMr. Hope had spoken to and about Mr. McMullen in front of the Warden about the improper \ncharge.\n83. In or about January 2012, Mr. Hope had an SCC review hearing where Major \nMcMullen  and  then-Lieutenant  Paul  Tolly  participated.    Upon  information  and  belief, \nMr. McMullenโs anger at Mr. Hope and involvement in his recent trumped-up disciplinary case \ncontributed  to  Mr.  McMullen  being  selected  to  join  this  review  hearing  panel.    Having \nMr. McMullen on the SCC panel meant that Mr. McMullen and the SCC members were able to \nspeak privately, including in the moments leading up to and after Mr. Hopeโs hearing when their \nattention was focused on keeping Mr. Hope in solitary.\n84. The extent of Mr. McMullenโs and the SCCโs conversations about Mr. Hope that \nday was soon revealed.  Several days after the review hearing, Mr. McMullen remarked to \nMr. Hope as he passed his cell that, in sum or substance, โYou can have anyone you want call us, \nbut itโs not going to help.  Youโre staying in Seg.โ  At that time, Mr. Hopeโs advocates had spoken \nwith SCC and classification officials about the sensationalized charge for the loose razors, but no \none outside of Mr. Hope had contacted Mr. McMullen.  Instead, this foreboding comment \nindicated that Mr. McMullen had partnered with the conspirators so that they now viewed \nthemselves as an โusโ against Mr. Hope.  To make sure that threat came true, Mr. McMullen and \nthe Classification Defendant conspirators orchestrated a grievous campaign of retaliation against \nMr. Hope, put into action the following month.\nB. In February 2012, The Conspirators Directed An Improper Confiscation Of \nMr. Hopeโs Property And Planted A Screwdriver In His Cell\n85. Within a few weeks of Mr. McMullenโs ominous threat that he had partnered with \nthe conspirators (to form an โusโ) to keep Mr. Hope in segregation, Mr. Hopeโs cell was searched \nand the typewriter he used to write grievances and letters to classification officials was confiscated.\n28\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 36 of 80 PageID #:\n648\n86. In  or  around  February  2012,  at  Mr.  McMullenโs  instruction,  Officer  Helen \nSheffield, Officer Burke, and several others arrived to search Mr. Hopeโs cell and sent him to wait \nat the shower.  After about an hour, Mr. Hope peered through the slit in the shower door and saw \nhis typewriter in the hallway.  Panicked, he yelled over to ask why.  Ms. Sheffield responded, in \nsum or substance, โI guess youโll have to find a different way to file grievances.โ  Following \nthrough with her threat, Ms. Sheffield took the typewriter.  Although she wrote in the confiscation \nreport that the typewriterโs wiring appeared altered, Mr. Hope had not altered the typewriter in any \nway since purchasing it directly from Polunskyโs commissaryโand it was in the same condition \nas it had been only days earlier when a different searching officer found no problem with it.\n87. Although Mr. Hope later grieved the improper confiscation, his grievance was \ndenied and his typewriter was never returned.  This confiscation hindered Mr. Hopeโs ability to \nfile grievances (which the TDCJ Offender Handbook instructed should be โtype[d] if possibleโ14), \nsend letters to the officials, and communicate with those advocating on his behalf.  Ultimately, \nMr. Hope had to spend $225 to buy a new typewriter from commissary and live with the fear that \nhis new one too could be confiscated at any time.\n88. When Mr. Hope was returned to his cell after Officer Sheffieldโs confiscations, he \ndiscovered  that  his  personal  belongings,  including  legal  communications  and  grievance \npaperwork, had been strewn about and a pen smeared with peanut butter stuck on his papers, \ndestroying all previous efforts he had made to organize his files.  Mr. Hope discovered that several \npages of his ledger, which contained contact information for the outside advocates working with \nhim to challenge his indefinite solitary confinement, were missing.  These pages were not listed \n14 TDCJ Offender Handbook (2004) at 53; see also TDCJ Offender Handbook (2017) at 74.\n29\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 37 of 80 PageID #:\n649\non Ms. Sheffieldโs confiscation report, although as Mr. Hope continued inquiring in the following \nweeks, Officer Sheffield eventually admitted in writing that she had taken the pages.\n89. As Mr. Hope continued cleaning up the mess, he noticed the officers had left behind \na red bag under his toilet.  He picked it up, unrolled it, and discovered a 10-inch screwdriver.\nC. Minutes Later, The Conspirators Sent Officers After The Planted โWeaponโ \nAnd Repeatedly Deployed A Chemical Agent\n90. It is unusual to have two cell searches within days of each other; it is extremely \nunusual to have two cell searches within the same hour.  Yet, that is what happened on this day in \nFebruary 2012.  It had never happened to Mr. Hope before, and it has never happened since.\n91. Approximately 15 minutes after he found the screwdriver, a second group of \nofficersโincluding then-Lieutenant Tolly, who had been at the January SCC review hearing with \nMr. McMullenโcame to search Mr. Hopeโs cell,15 before Mr. Hope even had a chance to decide \nwho he could safely contact about returning the screwdriver.\n92. Now wary that the screwdriver had been purposefully planted,16 Mr. Hope asked \nthe officers to return with a camera.  He feared the officers would claim the screwdriver was an \nescape tool and the SCC would use it as an excuse to keep him in solitary for years longer, so \n15 The group also included Officers Burke, Charles Mann, Runyon, Amanda Maddox, and Aaron \nBaker, now a captain, along with then-Sergeant and now Warden Terry Andrews. \n16 Mr. Hopeโs concerns proved to be well founded.  Six years after the screwdriver was planted in \nMr. Hopeโs cell, Major McMullen and others were the subject of an OIG investigation and a \nlawsuit for, among other misconduct, planting screwdrivers in a prisonerโs cell as retaliation for \nfiling grievances; as a result, multiple officers were indicted, terminated, resigned, or demoted and \ntransferred.  See Keri Blakinger, 4 Texas Prison Officials Indicted after Alleged Screwdriver-\nPlanting  Incident  at  Brazoria  Lockup,  HOUSTON  CHRONICLE  (July  11,  2018), \nhttps://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/4-Texas-prison-officials-indicted-after-\nalleged-13064474.php (โThe Office of the Inspector General launched an investigation and found \nthe claim had merit.โ); Giese v. Jackson, No. 3:19-CV-00081, 2020 WL 3493078, at *4 (S.D. Tex. \nMay 27, 2020) (finding that โthe summary judgment record contains evidence that McMullen \n[was] aware of [a prisonerโs] grievancesโ and โact[ed] against himโ by โplant[ing] screwdriverโs \nin [the prisonerโs] cellโ).\n30\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 38 of 80 PageID #:\n650\nMr. Hope wanted a recording of him peacefully and willingly returning the screwdriver and \nreflecting that it was TDCJโs screwdriver to ensure officers could not switch it out later for a \nprison-made screwdriver to discredit him.  The officers refused.  Mr. Hope nudged the screwdriver \nthrough the mesh screen of his cell.  He believed the officers would agree to get the video camera \nif he showed them he had their screwdriver and wanted to return it.  When they still refused, \nMr. Hope withdrew the screwdriver in a final effort to have the officers bring a video camera to \nhis cell.\n93. This effort was successful but not in the way Mr. Hope had expected.  Officers \nreturned with a video camera, as policy required when there was a risk of use of force, and with \nMr. McMullen.  Instead of allowing Mr. Hope to return the item on camera, officers entered his \ncell with immediate force.  Sergeant Andrews sprayed a chemical agent directly into Mr. Hopeโs \nface and body, triggering at least five bursts from the canister.  Mr. Hope was instantly enveloped \nin a painful burning sensation and fell to the floor.  The officers then forced Mr. Hope to strip \nnaked, handcuffed him, and moved him to a different cell, where the officers disabled the sinkโs \nrunning water.  Mr. Hope was left naked and alone, covered with the chemical residue for days.  \nOn the fourth day, he received only a pair of underwear but still had no way to clean the chemicals \noff his body without water (let alone soap).  Only on the eighth day was Mr. Hope given his \nclothing and property back and allowed to shower, despite standard policy that prisoners be offered \nthe chance to shower daily.  In a later conversation with Sergeant Andrews, Mr. Hope learned that \nMr. McMullen had mandated that Mr. Hope not be allowed to wash off the chemicals.\n94. It was February, and he was left with no clothing or blankets,17 though Mr. Hopeโs \nskin burned with artificial warmth from the chemicals.  Chemical residue coated every surface of \n17 In fact, blankets were withheld from Mr. Hope for almost a full month, despite the winter chill.\n31\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 39 of 80 PageID #:\n651\nhis property, which he had no way to clean, so every possession he touched, every paper he tried \nto read or letter he tried to write, caused him physical pain for weeks.  And for weeks Mr. Hope \nhad trouble tasting food because all he could taste was the chemical spray.  This was a life-altering \nincident for Mr. Hope, and his nightmares, anxiety, and depression from this extreme and \ninhumane series of acts continue to this day.\n95. Around this time, Mr. McMullen and Mr. Tolly again came by Mr. Hopeโs cell to \nconvey, in sum or in substance, that Mr. Hope was going to learn not to speak out about his \ntreatment or conditions.\n96. Despite  the  controversy  over  whether  the  screwdriver  had  been  planted  in \nMr. Hopeโs cell, the SCC jumped at the chance to cite the possession of weapon charge for the \nscrewdriver as the reason to prolong his segregation.  This fabricated story was first cited at his \nreview hearing in or around July 2012 before SCC member Lovelady.  It was next brought up in \nor around January 2013 when Mr. McMullen again joined SCC member Bilnoski for his review \nhearing.  Mr. McMullen affirmatively brought up the incident, claiming Mr. Hope had overreacted.  \nMr. Bilnoski denied Mr. Hopeโs release to G.P. because, in sum or substance, that incident โdidnโt \nhelp [his] cause.โ\nV. MR. HOPE CONTINUED TO CHALLENGE HIS MISTREATMENT AS \nDEFENDANTS TRIED TO SILENCE HIM\nA. Mr. Hope Continued Speaking Out Against His Mistreatment\n97. Fearful of further retaliation, but with limited options, Mr. Hope filed a grievance \nin or about early March 2012, despite still experiencing burning sensations on his fingers.  In the \ngrievance, he challenged two of the three major disciplinary cases he received arising from the \nplanted screwdriver: assault of an officer and possession of a weapon.  This time he wrote his \n32\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 40 of 80 PageID #:\n652\ngrievance by hand, reminding him of Officer Sheffieldโs taunt when she took his typewriter that \nhe would need to โfind a different way to file grievances.โ\n98. In addition to grievances, Mr. Hope continued his widespread outreach efforts, \nspeaking out about his mistreatment during those February incidents and seeking help from anyone \nseemingly in a position to provide it.  Mr. Hope and his advocates contacted, among others, \nClassification  Defendants  White  and  Enloe,  then-Texas  Senator  Whitmire,  and  a  Senior \nCorrespondent at MSNBC.\n99. Ultimately, Mr. Hopeโs charges were reduced despite his grievance being denied.  \nInstead of being charged with stabbing an officer, which never occurred, the charge was reduced \nto attempt (which also never occurred).  And the possession of a weapon charge for the planted \nscrewdriver was dropped altogether after an investigation concluded the screwdriver belonged to \nMs.  Sheffieldโs  search  team.    Notably,  Mr.  Hope  did  not  challenge  the  refusal-to-follow-\ninstruction charge because he acknowledged that he had refused to follow an instruction while \nwaiting for the officers to bring the video camera.  Instead, he had challenged only those charges \nin which he was accused of doing something he had not done.\nB. The Conspirators Implemented Constant Cell Moves That Unsettled Mr. \nHope And Exposed Him To Inhumane Conditions\n100. As Mr. Hopeโs efforts continued, so did the Classification Defendantsโ and those \nof their co-conspirator, Mr. McMullenโthis time instituting an unofficial โcell-move policyโ \nagainst Mr. Hope.  Previously, Mr. Hope was moved infrequently and spent lengthy periods of \ntime in the same cell throughout his first 17 years in solitary.  In contrast, after 2012, Mr. Hope \nwas moved on a near-constant basisโapproximately 260 times between 2012 and 2018.  This rate \nof moves lacked penological or security purpose and exacted a grave toll on Mr. Hope. \n33\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 41 of 80 PageID #:\n653\n101. At first after the manufactured February incidents, Mr. Hope was on a heightened \nsecurity level, limiting the number of cells available in which he could be placed.  As time passed, \nMr. McMullen and Mr. Tolly were the first to review Mr. Hopeโs housing assignment.  They \ncompleted a form to keep him at a more restrictive (and less desirable) level.  However, a secretary \nsaw the assignment and knew they were mislabeling Mr. Hope, who by that point had graduated \nto the lowest security level in solitary after 90 days without incident. The secretary corrected the \nform, initialing next to her change.  Unfortunately for Mr. Hope, there were more cells available \nfor those on the less-restrictive level and this is when the disruptive cell moves escalated, often to \nmultiple times per week.\n102. On or about March 20, 2013, Mr. Hope was interviewed by a writer from GQ, and \nthe  two  discussed  Mr.  Hopeโs  frequent  cell  moves.18    Within  approximately  two  days, \nMr. McMullen had Mr. Hope brought to his office and questioned him about the interview.  \nApproximately three days later, Mr. McMullen ordered Mr. Hope moved to a cell in a more \nrestrictive (worse) pod despite TDCJ policy of housing prisoners classified at the lowest security \nlevel, which Mr. Hope was on at the time, together in a separate area.  These cell moves continued \nfor years, with Mr. Hope often being moved into seemingly the worst cells available.\n103. This scheme included forcing Mr. Hope into cells in various states of disrepair.  As \none example, on or about June 30, 2015, while Polunsky Defendant Harris was Senior Warden, \nMr. Hope was moved to a cell with no working lights.  Inside the cell, it was so dark that the \nofficers had to use their flashlights to move Mr. Hope into the cell.  Mr. Hope objected, noting \nhow the lack of visibility posed a security and safety risk, but he was threatened with a disciplinary \n18  Alex  Hanneford,  Living  in  a  Box,  GQ,  Nov.  7,  2013,  available  at  https://www.gq-\nmagazine.co.uk/article/solitary-confinement-american-human-rights.\n34\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 42 of 80 PageID #:\n654\ncase for โrefusing to accept housingโ if he did not enter.  Once moved in, Mr. Hope had to fight to \nbe served meals, as officers required the lights to be on at mealtimes.\n104. Mr. Hope was now being moved so frequently that it was difficult for him to address \nconcerns about the inhospitable or unsanitary conditions in one cell before he was moved again.  \nFor example, in or about November 2015, Mr. Hope was moved to a cell smeared with someone \nelseโs feces and urine.  He filed a grievance about this risk to his health, but he was soon moved \nyet again, so by the time he received a response to his grievance, it noted the issue was resolved \nas Mr. Hope was no longer housed in the feces-covered cell about which he had complained.  The \nproblem for Mr. Hope was that he had been moved to a different inhospitable cell.  This timing \nbegan a patternโby the time he could file a grievance and get a response, he would be in yet \nanother different cell, a pattern that allowed the dangers go unremedied.\n105. Still other cells exposed Mr. Hope to excessive heat or cold.  One such cell on or \naround December 30, 2015 (again while Polunsky Defendant Harris was Senior Warden), had no \nheat when it was approximately 38 degrees outside.  Mr. Hopeโs request for heat went unanswered, \nas officers put a โno heatโ notation into the log.  In response to his grievance, an official noted the \nheat was to be repaired, but temperature problems were a common occurrence in Mr. Hopeโs cells.\n106. Mr. Hopeโs many cells often had something else in common: rather than being \nsanitized prior to officers moving Mr. Hope in, many cells contained mold and the urine, feces, \nand vomit of previous occupants, as well as rats and cockroaches.  As but one example, in or \naround November 2016, officers were told to move Mr. Hope into a(nother) cell so covered in the \nprevious inhabitantโs excrement that when Lieutenant Farris and Assistant Warden Smith walked \npast it, they visibly recoiled from the stench.  They were unable to tolerate the odor for mere \n35\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 43 of 80 PageID #:\n655\nmoments, but Mr. Hope was locked inside for days without even being given proper cleaning \nsupplies to improve the filth.\nVI. THE CLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS ACKNOWLEDGED MR. HOPEโS SCC \nREVIEW HEARINGS WERE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE THEY โNEVERโ \nPLANNED TO RELEASE HIM FROM SOLITARY \n107. As Mr. Hopeโs cell transfers increased, so too did the lack of clarity around the \nreview process for his solitary classification.  And with the two-year anniversary of the disciplinary \ncases related to the planted screwdriver approaching, the Classification Defendants pointed to \nother excuses to keep Mr. Hope in segregation.\nA. Realizing The Conspirators Went Too Far, Mr. Treon Pushed For \nMr. Hopeโs ReleaseโBut The Conspirators Admitted Mr. Hope Would \nโNeverโ Get Out Of Segregation\n108. Several years after his retirement, Mr. Treon was visiting Polunsky and saw \nMr. Hope in a segregation cell.  Mr. Treon seemed surprised and asked Mr. Hope what had \nhappened in G.P. that led to Mr. Hope being put back in solitary.  Mr. Hope explained he was still \nfighting to be released from his classification to segregation back in 1995.  Mr. Treon expressed a \nwillingness to help Mr. Hope but explained his voice may no longer carry weight.\n109. Mr. Treon contacted the SCC, explaining that he supported Mr. Hopeโs release to \nG.P., but the SCC said, in sum or substance, that its hands were tied for at least 24 months from \nthe screwdriver incident.\n110. Later on, Mr. Hope wrote to Mr. Treon, asking if he would try again.  Mr. Treon \nrecognized that although Mr. Hope was an escape risk years earlier, he was not the same personโ\nhe was older, demonstrated an ability to follow prison rules, and had never been โan extreme actor \nother than running off.โ19  Mr. Treon called the Director of Classification, whom he knew from \n19 The Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinement, at 13:32-14:48 (emphasis added).\n36\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 44 of 80 PageID #:\n656\nhis time with TDCJ, and asked to speak about Mr. Hope:  Mr. Treon โsaid โYou know Dennis \nWayne Hope?โ and she goes, โI sure do.โ  I said โAre yโall ever going to let him loose [from \nsegregation]โ and she goes, โoh no, heโll never get out of Seg.โโ20  By this point, Mr. Treon \nrecognized โthe right decision is not always made.โ21\nB. The Classification Defendants Upheld Their Agreement For Mr. Hope To \nโNeverโ Get Out Of Segregation\n111. Just after the two-year clock lapsed from the disciplinary cases resulting from the \nplanted screwdriver, Classification Defendant Enloe responded to the latest set of communications \nfrom Mr. Hopeโs advocates.  In a March 2014 response, and again in May 2014, Ms. Enloe told \nadvocates that a โspecial reviewโ of Mr. Hope was recently conducted by the deputy directors, \nwho decided Mr. Hope must remain in segregation.  Although various SCC members had \ndisclaimed authority to release Mr. Hope, and Mr. Hope had repeatedly asked who, in fact, had \nsuch authority, this was one of the first (but not the last) times he was told someone above the SCC \nhad reviewed him.  Despite asking, neither Mr. Hope nor his advocates could find out which deputy \ndirectors had supposedly reviewed him, when, why, or what their role was in his review process.\n112. In the coming years, Mr. Hope and his advocates continued reminding SCC and \nclassification officials, including through letters and emails to Classification Defendants White, \nEnloe, and Echessa, that the screwdriver charges had been manufactured, and that even if they \nignored that information, the assault case had been downgraded to attempt and the possession of \nweapon charge eventually dropped altogether.  Yet, despite considerable time passing since these \ncases, and despite Mr. Hope and his advocates recounting the questionable nature of the charges, \n20 Id.\n21 Id.\n37\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 45 of 80 PageID #:\n657\nthe screwdriver incident continued being raised at SCC review hearings and by the Classification \nDefendants in their responses to Mr. Hopeโs advocatesโ inquiries.\nC. Classification Defendant Bennett Joined The Classification Defendantsโ \nAgreement To Keep Mr. Hope In Solitary \n113. Classification Defendant Bennett began appearing as an SCC member at Mr. \nHopeโs review hearings in 2015 and 2016.  At Mr. Hopeโs first review hearing before her, Ms. \nBennett allowed Mr. Hope to make a statement and seemed to actually listen to his concerns as he \nrecounted his experiences in segregation, including the unsanitary cells he was being shuffled \nbetween and the effects being exacted on his physical and mental health.  Ms. Bennett told Mr. \nHope she found no reason not to release him to G.P.  She explained to a grateful Mr. Hope that \nshe would place him in a transition program on his way to G.P.  After Ms. Bennett went back to \nher office in Huntsville, where she worked with the other Classification Defendants, however, Mr. \nHopeโs SCC Review Hearing Record was filled out to show that rather than be released to a \ntransition program, Mr. Hope was to remain in solitary.  No one bothered to communicate this \nchange to Mr. Hope directly and he learned of the switch three weeks later when he received the \nform.  At his next review hearing before Classification Defendant and then-SCC member Bennett, \nMr. Hope asked Ms. Bennett why he had not been sent to the transition program.  This time, Ms. \nBennett repeated the party line to Mr. Hope: she was told she did not have the authority to release \nMr. Hope from solitary. \n114. Classification Defendant Bennett was the first person to tell Mr. Hope that he was \nโhigh profileโ so could only be released by the CID Director or Deputy Director.  Around this \ntime, Mr. Hope began hearing from several other SCC members and Classification Defendants \nthat he could not be released because of a โhigh profileโ status, which SCC member Armstrong \nclaimed was reflected by a โHX Proโ abbreviation on the last page of Mr. Hopeโs SCC file \n38\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 46 of 80 PageID #:\n658\n(although was not reflected on the SCC Review Hearing Records Mr. Hope received after \nhearings).  It remains unclear to Mr. Hope what a โhigh profileโ status means, how someone \nacquires such a status, or what one can do to challenge the status or have it removed from their \nfile.  As a practical matter, the โhigh profileโ status again made Mr. Hopeโs SCC review hearings \nentirely meaningless.  And to the extent this โhigh profileโ status may be tied to his decades-old \nescape  and  resulted  in  Mr.  Hopeโs  continued  segregation,  such  segregation  was  grossly \ndisproportionate punishment.  To the extent his โhigh profileโ status may be tied to his advocacy \nand outreachโwhich is protected activityโthe designation in itself is unlawful retaliation.\n115. As he did on other occasions, Mr. Hope filed a grievance stating that because Ms. \nBennett conducted his review hearing but lacked (or claimed to lack) authority to actually release \nhim from solitary, his review was meaningless.  Polunsky Defendant Harris denied this grievance.\nVII. MR.  HOPE  ENDURED  MEANINGLESS  REVIEWS  WHILE  THE \nCLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS SHIFTED ATTENTION TO OTHERS\n116. This pattern of the Classification Defendants and their subordinates pointing Mr. \nHope and his advocates in other directions to find someone responsible for releasing him from \nsegregation continued for years.\n117. In or about June 2017, Classification Defendant Enloe, SCC Chair at the time, \nconducted  Mr.  Hopeโs  SCC  review  hearing,  joined  by  Polunsky  Defendant  Rehse.    The \ncircumstances were unusual.  SCC chairs rarely conducted review hearingsโthe chair typically \nremained in Huntsville and did not travel to the units for hearings.  Despite being SCC Chair, \nthough, Ms. Enloe claimed it was not her decision whether to release Mr. Hope to G.P.\n118. Mr. Hope asked why she was reviewing him if she lacked authority to decide the \nvery issue the review hearing was held to decide.  Ms. Enloe said she was asked to make the trip \nto Polunsky by her superior (and co-conspirator), Classification Defendant White, and had agreed \n39\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 47 of 80 PageID #:\n659\nto deliver a message on Ms. Whiteโs behalf to Mr. Hope that, in sum or substance, his having \npeople contact the SCC or classification officials for him would โnot do him any good.โ  Ms. Enloe \noccasionally appeared at subsequent review hearings for Mr. Hope as well, always at the same \ntime as when Mr. Hope and his advocates were most active in speaking out about his mistreatment \nand the poor conditions of his confinement.\n119. Polunsky Defendant Rehseโs presence at this June 2017 SCC review hearing gave \nClassification Defendant Enloe the opportunity to speak with Mr. Rehse about Mr. Hope, including \nin private conversations before Mr. Hope arrived and after he left the hearing.  \n120. The repeated denials did not deter Mr. Hope or his supporters from advocating for \nhim.  For example, in 2017, supporters wrote multiple letters to classification officials including \nClassification Defendant White, urging the SCC to reconsider its past decisions. \nA. Polunsky Defendant Rehse Agreed To Continue Mr. Hopeโs Frequent \nMoves, Now Into Worsening Conditions\n121. In addition to being when Polunsky Defendant Rehse started joining Mr. Hopeโs \nSCC review hearings, 2017 was also the year when Mr. Hope noticed Mr. Rehseโs name on the \nforms authorizing multiple of his cell moves.  Mr. Hope thought it might help if he spoke with Mr. \nRehse, so in mid-to-late 2017, Mr. Hope asked Mr. Rehse why he was moved so frequently.  Mr. \nRehse acknowledged he was involved in Mr. Hopeโs cell moves and that, in sum or in substance, \nโthey started it and Iโm not about to end it.โ\n122. The more Mr. Hope was shuffled between cells, the more officers remarked how \npointless the moves were: someone ranking above the officers (often Polunsky Defendant Rehse) \nrequested and authorized the moves so they were bound to carry them out but complained that \nmoving Mr. Hope so often wasted time and created extra work, such as when they had to search \nfor Mr. Hope to deliver his mail.  Yet the frequent moves continued.\n40\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 48 of 80 PageID #:\n660\n123. The cell moves continued to expose Mr. Hope to unsafe and unsanitary conditions.  \nOne three-week period in or around late 2017 illustrates the extent of these inhospitable conditions.  \nDuring this short period, Polunsky Defendant Rehse authorized Mr. Hopeโs placement in at least \nfive different cells containing mold.  In one cell, the problem was so severe that, upon entering, \nMr. Hope thought a previous occupant had set the wall on fire.  He later realized that what he \nthought was a charred wall was, in fact, a thick layer of black mold.  Mr. Hope showed the mold-\ncovered wall to Polunsky Defendant Rehse and others, but no corrective measures were takenโ\nMr. Hope was even denied proper cleaning supplies.  Mr. Hope filed a grievance but that too was \ndenied.  Eventually, Mr. Hope asked an advocate to contact the unit.  The advocate managed to \ntalk to Warden Jefferson, who ordered Mr. Hope be moved to a different cell without mold.\n124. Still, the problem persisted.  For example, in or around October 2018, Mr. Hope \nwas moved into yet another moldy cellโthis time with black mold in the corners, the base of the \nwall, and near the ceiling, and with standing water pooled across the floor.  Like he had done on \nother occasions, Mr. Hope reported the issue, this time to Officer Palmer, who informed Mr. Hope \nthat officials already knew this cell was contaminated with mold before they had Mr. Hope moved \ninto it.  Mr. Hope reported the mold (and its effect on his breathing) directly to at least seven staff \nmembers ranked under Polunsky Defendant Rehse, but each refused to move Mr. Hope to a clean \ncell.  Instead, Mr. Hope was left in this cell much longer than others and forced to wait two months \nbefore staff initiated a maintenance work order, which also failed to remove the mold.  Frequent \nmold exposure caused and exacerbated Mr. Hopeโs respiratory issues, including as demonstrated \nby Mr. Hopeโs medical evaluation in or around November 2018.  Despite the dangers these \nconditions presented to Mr. Hopeโs physical and mental health, and despite his pleas for correction, \nMr. Hope was left in squalor.  Mr. Hope saw Polunsky Defendant Harris, then Senior Warden, \n41\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 49 of 80 PageID #:\n661\nseveral times during this period.  Mr. Harris needed no introduction as he already knew who Mr. \nHope was.  When Mr. Hope asked about his frequent moves into unsafe cells, Mr. Harris indicated \nhe would not intervene to stop it.\n125. While Polunsky Defendant Rehse was the Major over Polunskyโs segregation unit, \nMr. Hope was also exposed to other unsafe conditions, including chemical agents despite having \ndone nothing warranting deployment.  This exposure occurred multiple times, including at least \ntwice in 2017, when Mr. Rehse ordered officers to keep exhaust fans off and not to ventilate or \nclean after chemical agents had been deployed in close proximity to, but not because of, Mr. Hope.\n126. The regular cell moves, enacted first by Mr. McMullen and continued by Mr. \nRehse, have caused physical and psychological harm to Mr. Hope.  The coordinated attack on Mr. \nHope through his living conditions left Mr. Hope constantly disoriented and perpetually unsafe.  \nMr. Hope was forced to remain on high alert as he tried to adjust to different surroundings, with \ncountless new noises from new neighborsโwhile also bracing himself against a constant threat of \nretaliation.  Mr. Hope developed persistent insomnia, routinely sleeping only several hours per \nnight, and often in interrupted spurts, including because officers sometimes moved him between \ncells in the middle of the night.  Additionally, these frequent moves caused delays to Mr. Hopeโs \nmail, which impeded his ability to correspond with officials, his advocates, and media members.  \nOn at least one occasion, official paperwork from the SCC was not properly delivered to Mr. Hope.\n127. While any move is inherently stressful, here, the damage was only magnified by \nthe frequency with which Mr. Hope was moved and the conditions he was forced into, as well as \nthe effects of his long-term isolation without meaningful access to mental health care.  Mr. Hope \nhad no agency to get himself out of segregation, and no agency over his conditions within \nsegregation.  Due to the frequent cell moves, Mr. Hope suffered, and continues to suffer, from \n42\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 50 of 80 PageID #:\n662\nanxiety, depression, obsessive compulsions, diminished ability to concentrate, confusion, memory \nloss, paranoia, thoughts of self-harm, and insomnia, and conditions such as hypertension (high \nblood pressure) were exacerbated.\n128. Being constantly shuffled to new cells caused Mr. Hope harm and frequently \nexposed him to physically unsafe conditions.  Mr. Hope was regularly moved into cells that were \nin disrepair or were so unsanitary as to be unfit for human occupancy.  Polunsky Defendants Rehse \nand Harris, as well as the Classification Defendants, knew of these conditionsโbecause Mr. Hope \npersonally showed or told each of themโbut disregarded the risks posed:  Mr. Rehse continued \nauthorizing cell moves, Mr. Harris ignored Mr. Hopeโs expressed concerns about his health, and \nthe Classification Defendants continued finding excuses to justify his indefinite placement in \nsegregation.  Further, each of the Classification Defendants knew of the inhumane conditions of \nMr. Hopeโs confinement and the effect it was having on Mr. Hope.  Instead of taking steps to have \nthose conditions corrected or to have Mr. Hope released from segregation, the Classification \nDefendants continued rubber stamping his placement in disregard of the risks to Mr. Hope.\n129. Despite Defendantsโ design and agreement to frustrate his ability to do so, Mr. Hope \nfiled grievances related to the aforementioned cell moves, thereby exhausting available remedies.\nB. Polunsky Defendant Rehse Participated In Further SCC Review Hearings\n130. Polunsky Defendant Rehse was present at Mr. Hopeโs next review hearing in or \naround December 2017, this time with Classification Defendant Fiveash and Amanda Maddox \n(who had also been part of the team that collected the planted screwdriver in February 2012, and \nthat gassed Mr. Hope with chemical agents and then left him naked and exposed for days in the \naftermath).  This review hearing, like others, was over quickly.  Ms. Fiveash told Mr. Hope she \nlacked authority to release him.  Mr. Hope asked if and how he could speak to someone with the \nauthority to release him.  Ms. Fiveash indicated that only the Director of TDCJ could release Mr. \n43\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 51 of 80 PageID #:\n663\nHope to G.P., and although Mr. Hope would have to speak to someone outside the SCC to get \nreleased, the SCC would see him again in six months.  Mr. Rehse remarked to Mr. Hope, in sum \nor in substance, that Mr. Hope was his own worst enemy, indicating that his treatment was tied to \nMr. Hopeโs continued advocacy efforts.\n131. Polunsky Defendant Rehse joined a third consecutive SCC review hearing in or \naround June 2018 with another SCC member.  Outside of his review hearings, Mr. Hope asked \nMr. Rehse what he thought it would take for Mr. Hope to be released to G.P., only to have Mr. \nRehse respond that he didnโt believe Mr. Hope would ever be released from segregation. \nVIII. SCC MEMBERS REVEALED MR. HOPEโS HEARINGS WERE MERE \nโWELFARE CHECKS,โ NOT DESIGNED FOR MEANINGFUL REVIEW\n132. As time wore on, classification and TDCJ officials continued to provide Mr. Hope \nwith conflicting information.  On or about August 11, 2017, in response to a grievance, Assistant \nRegional Director Matt Gross told Mr. Hope that โThe State Classification Committee can make \nthe decision to release an offender from Administrative Segregation; however, if an offender has \nan escape on file, justification must be forwarded to the Chairman of Classification for approval.  \nYou have been reviewed by a special administrative committee for offenders who have been \nclassified to Administrative Segregation for over 15 years.โ  Mr. Hope had heard reference to an \nadministrative committee once beforeโin or around January 2013, when SCC member Bilnoski \ntold Mr. Hope that because the committee had reviewed his file, Mr. Bilnoski could not make an \nindependent decisionโbut no one had raised it since despite Mr. Hopeโs continued questions.  One \nof Mr. Hopeโs advocates called TDCJ and learned that Classification Defendant Echessa was the \ncommitteeโs head.\n133. Although Mr. Echessa agreed he had the authority to make a release decision on \nhis own, he insisted that he would not get involved unless he received a request or recommendation \n44\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 52 of 80 PageID #:\n664\nfrom  classification  first  (which  contradicted  information  from  other  of  the  Classification \nDefendants  and  the  examples  where  committee  members  recommended  that  Mr.  Hope  be \nreleased).  To further confuse matters, also in August 2017, Mr. Hope received a letter from \nClassification Defendant Enloe stating that no special review process applied to Mr. Hope and he \nwould be evaluated again at his next regular SCC review hearing.  In short, it was entirely unclear \nto Mr. Hope whether an SCC member could authorize his release from segregation at a review \nhearing or whether he was subject to some modified review procedure and, if so, what that \nprocedure was based onโhis former escape, the purported โunusual and difficultโ nature of his \ncircumstances, his โhigh profileโ status, or the length of time he had been in solitary confinement.\n134. In or around December 2018, at an SCC review hearing, Mr. Hope was told by SCC \nmember Armstrong that a group of TDCJ directors had reviewed Mr. Hopeโs file years earlier and \nhad not released him to G.P., that Mr. Hope had not been reviewed for release in the years since, \nand that Mr. Armstrong too felt he lacked authority to do so.  Instead, Mr. Armstrong indicated \nthat Mr. Hopeโs previous escape in his record meant he would remain in segregation for the entirety \nof his sentence.  Assistant Warden Perez, who was also present, seemed to agree, stating that the \nSCC will not release to G.P. anyone who had escaped before.  SCC member Thompson similarly \ntold Mr. Hope she did not have the authority to release him from segregation because of his \nprevious escape.  At Mr. Hopeโs review hearing in or around December 2019, SCC member \nTrevino went further, reporting to Mr. Hope that his SCC hearings were mere โwelfare checksโ \nbecause TDCJ directors reviewed his case only once every 10 years.\n135. As he had done for years, Mr. Hope filed grievances regarding these hearings and \nthe lack of meaningful review available to him.  He and his advocates sent additional letters to the \nClassification Defendants and others outlining their concerns with what Mr. Hope was told at \n45\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 53 of 80 PageID #:\n665\nreview hearings and pleading for someone with authority to actually review him for release from \nsegregation.  Mr. Hope survived these unconstitutional conditions of confinement and continued \nto advocate for himself, in the face of sham proceedings and retaliation, for nearly three decades.\nIX. MR. HOPE WAS RELEASED FROM SOLITARY BUT EXPERIENCED \nFURTHER MISTREATMENT\nA. Mr. Hope Was Released From Solitary In 2022 Because Of The Supreme \nCourtโs Impending Review Of His Claims In This Case\n136. After 27 years in solitary confinement, Mr. Hope was finally released to G.P. on or \nabout February 7, 2022โone week after, and seemingly because, he filed a Petition for Writ of \nCertiorari with the United States Supreme Court to challenge dismissal of his Eighth Amendment \nand other claims in this case.  See Hope v. Harris, No. 20-40379, Dkt. No. 3 (U.S. Jan. 28, 2021).\n137. Mr. Hope originally filed this case in February 2018, seeking both injunctive relief \nand damages.  Dkt. No. 1; see also Dkt. No. 15.  Following decisions on a motion to dismiss, Dkt. \nNo. 28, and an appeal to the Fifth Circuit, Hope v. Harris, 861 F. Appโx 571 (5th Cir. 2021), Mr. \nHope  sought  certiorari  regarding  whether  prolonged  solitary  confinement  can,  under  some \ncircumstances, violate the Eighth Amendment, a question on which there is a longstanding circuit \nsplit, and whether defendants violated his right to procedural due process.  Hope v. Harris, No. \n20-40379, Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Dkt. No. 3 at i (U.S. Jan. 28, 2021).\n138. Seemingly to avoid the Supreme Courtโs review of his case, Mr. Hope was finally \nreleased from solitary confinement on February 7, 2022.  The Polunsky and Classification \nDefendants then argued that his eleventh-hour release mooted his claims for injunctive relief.22  \n22 Mr. Hope reserves the right to pursue injunctive relief if he is again placed in segregation.  To \ndate, Mr. Hope has already been re-placed in solitary on two separate occasions, both in November \n2022 for a total of approximately five days, while at the Estelle Medical Facility for an eye exam.  \nNeither was pursuant to proper procedure. \n46\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 54 of 80 PageID #:\n666\nHope v. Harris, No. 20-40379, Response to Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Dkt. No. 13 at 12โ13 \n(U.S. May 9, 2022).\n139. At the time of his release from solitary, no explanation was provided to Mr. Hope \nabout why he was suddenly being released to G.P., or on whose authority, after so many years of \nhaving his self-advocacy go entirely unnoticed.  Indeed, his most recent SCC review hearing had \nbeen on or about January 6, 2022, just a month before his release.  Although he had the rights to \nattend and to make or submit statements at SCC review hearings, Mr. Hope was told he was not \npermitted to attend this January review hearing due to COVID-19, and he had not received enough \nadvance notice to be able to mail a statement to the SCC for consideration.  Mr. Hopeโs release to \nG.P. was again denied at this January 2022 review hearing.\n140. On May 4, 2022, now-Director of Classifications Timothy Fitzpatrick provided a \ndeclaration as part of Defendantsโ briefing to the United States Supreme Court.  There, Mr. \nFitzpatrick claimed that โ[o]n Feb. 4, 2022, the State Classification Committee held a hearing to \nconsider Dennis Wayne Hopeโs . . . continued classification in Restrictive Housing. . . . The \nCommittee reached this decision [to release him to G.P.] after extensive consideration of all prior \ncriminogenic  history,  institutional  adjustment,  the  recommendation  of  Polunsky  Unit \nAdministration concerning current behavior, and in consultation with the leadership of TDCJ.โ  \nHope v. Harris, No. 20-40379, Suggestion of Mootness and Brief in Opp., app., Dkt. No. 21-1065 \nat 1a-3a (U.S. May 4, 2022).  This declaration was the first time Mr. Hope had heard about this \nalleged  irregularly  scheduled  review  hearing,  purportedly  conducted  while  Classification \nDefendant Bennett was SCC Chair.  Mr. Hope had not received notice prior to the review hearing, \nwas not given an opportunity to attend or present statements, and still to this day has not received \na written record of the decision.\n47\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 55 of 80 PageID #:\n667\n141. In the 27 years preceding his release from solitary, Mr. Hope never had SCC review \nhearings in back-to-back months.  The closest irregularity was the July 2007 review hearing where \nMs. Jones claimed the SCC had no record of the April 2007 review hearing at which Mr. Rogers \nfirst decided to release Mr. Hope to G.P.  The unprecedented timing further calls into question the \nmotive for this impromptu February 2022 review hearing outside of Mr. Hopeโs presence.\nB. Mr. Hope Transitioned To Ellis Unit, And Was Met With Ellis Defendants \nSimmonsโ and Clarkโs Excessive Use Of Force\n142. In February 2022, Mr. Hope was transferred from solitary to a transition program \nat the Ellis Unit in Huntsville, Texasโwhere the SCC is also headquartered.  While there, Ellis \nDefendants Simmons and Clark used excessive force to injure Mr. Hope, only relenting when \nhospital medical staff and an Ellis warden stepped in with corrective action.\n143. From Mr. Hopeโs first day at Ellis, it was clear that SCC and classification officials \nwere unhappy with his release from solitary, and they let the Ellis Unit staff know it.  Classification \nDefendant and now-SCC Chair Bennett and Director of Classification Fitzpatrick came to Ellis to \ndeliver an ominous message in front of Mr. Hopeโs new housing section and staff: Mr. Fitzpatrick \nhad a long career in front of him and would โrememberโ Mr. Hope.  Mr. Hope never had a cell \nmate while at Ellis despite double-celling being standard, and heard this decision was made at the \ndirection of Classification Defendant Bennett, who dictated that Mr. Hope must be housed alone.\n144. While at Ellis, Mr. Hope participated in a cognitive intervention program that \nincluded a journaling component.  Mr. Hope wrote in his journal about his time in solitary, \nmistreatment he had experienced, and wanting to effect change in how other prisoners in solitary \nare treated.  Mr. Hope shared this entry in front of the class and instructor in May 2022.  Although \nhe did not know it at the time, Mr. Hope would never see his journal again.\n48\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 56 of 80 PageID #:\n668\n145. On or about May 22, 2022, Mr. Hope experienced respiratory distress and reported \nsevere difficulty breathing.  When evaluated, on-site medical providers requested an immediate \nemergency medical transport to Huntsville Memorial Hospital.  Ellis Defendant Simmons and \nSergeant Schwartz were responsible for preparing Mr. Hope for transport.  Mr. Schwartz first \nplaced restraints on Mr. Hope, leaving the appropriate one-finger width of space between the \nhandcuffs and Mr. Hopeโs wrists.  Then, without justification and despite Mr. Hopeโs emergency \nmedical needs, Ellis Defendant Simmons re-fastened the handcuffs, clamping them so tightly that \nthe metal bit into Mr. Hopeโs wrists.  Ms. Simmons then told Mr. Hope to โget used to it.โ  During \nthe ambulance ride to the hospital, Mr. Hopeโs wrists and hands began going numb due to the \ntightness of the handcuffs.\n146. At the hospital, Ellis Defendant Clark met the ambulance and escorted Mr. Hope to \na treatment bed.  A nurse saw Mr. Hopeโs now-purple hands and asked Mr. Clark why the restraints \nwere so tight.  Mr. Clark responded, in sum or substance, โitโs like that for a reason.โ  The nurse \ntold Mr. Clark that the overly tightened cuffs were causing Mr. Hope to lose circulation to his \nhands, but Mr. Clark merely repeated that he had a reason.\n147. At Mr. Hopeโs treatment bed in the emergency room, a different nurse asked Ellis \nDefendant Clark why Mr. Hopeโs handcuffs were so tight that his hands were discolored and \nswollen.  This nurse received the same vague explanation that there was a reason.  Unsatisfied, the \nnurse pressed for the reason, but was shut down by Mr. Clarkโs response, in sum or in substance: \nโyou handle the medical, weโll handle the security.โ  Throughout that day and evening, Mr. Hope \ncomplained of severe pain in his wrists to no avail.  His hands grew more swollen and purple. \n148. Mr. Hope was diagnosed with pneumonia.  The next afternoon, a doctor came to \nMr. Hopeโs hospital room.  Almost immediately, the doctor saw Mr. Hopeโs wrists and hands and \n49\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 57 of 80 PageID #:\n669\nleft to speak with Captain Flores just outside Mr. Hopeโs room.  Captain Flores called her \nsupervisor, the warden at the Byrd Unit, who instructed her to call Ellis Warden Kelly Strong.  \nWarden Strong instructed Captain Flores to apply the handcuffs according to policy, meaning to \nloosen them until there was one fingerโs width of space between each handcuff and wrist. \n149. The damage had already been done, and Mr. Hope experienced significant pain in \nhis wrists and hands throughout his week in the hospital.  Nurses had to continually bandage Mr. \nHopeโs wrists due to the damage inflicted by Ellis Defendants Simmons and Clark.  Since this \nincident, Mr. Hope experiences periods of numbness in his hands, most severely around the base \nof his right thumb.23  The pain flares up anytime he is required to wear restraints, which he must \nwhenever he is transported for medical care offsite.\n150. Mr. Hope filed grievances related to the aforementioned use of excessive force, \nthereby exhausting available remedies.\n151. After his time at Ellis, Mr. Hope was transferred to the Connally Unit, and he \ncurrently remains housed there.  \nX. DEFENDANTSโ ACTIONS RESULTED IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HARM \nTO MR. HOPE\n152. Mr. Hopeโs physical and mental health have deteriorated after spending half of his \nlife in isolation, much longer than any security purpose required, and frequently in inhumane \nconditions unfit for human habitation.  He has tried to stave off the effects of solitary as much as \npossible.  For example, Mr. Hope noticed his vocabulary diminishing, so he tried to focus on \nspeech patterns in radio programming.  Ultimately, he believes even with his efforts that his \nphysical ability to speak and cognitive ability to converse have deteriorated.\n23 Indeed, Mr. Hope was diagnosed with paresthesia (numbness) in his right thumb when seen by \nmedical staff at the Connally Unit months later.\n50\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 58 of 80 PageID #:\n670\n153. In some instances, Defendantsโ acts compounded the effects of solitary.  For \nexample, Mr. Hopeโs eyesight has declined, in part due to regular factors such as age, but also in \npart because Defendants repeatedly moved him into cells with no or few working lights, leaving \nhim to strain through darkness to write, read, or even see his food to eat.\n154. Examples of other harms include, but are not limited to, the following:\nA. Respiratory Issues\n155. Mr. Hope suffered from upper respiratory issues as a result of his repeated and \nintentional exposure to mold.  Living in squalor in cells that had not been cleaned prior to staff \nmoving Mr. Hope into them, and often with only minimal or no proper cleaning supplies available \nto him, exposed Mr. Hope to mold unnecessarily.  These conditions continued even after Mr. Hope \nmade these issues known, causing still further health issues.\nB. Lower Back, Shoulder, and Knee Pain\n156. Mr. Hope suffers from chronic, burning lower back and leg pain exacerbated by \nyears spent in a cramped space with minimal opportunities for recreation.  Although staff initially \nallowed Mr. Hope a brace to support his back, a doctor rescinded that order in the early 2000s, \ninstead finding that Mr. Hope needed exercise and physical therapy to strengthen his back.  But \nwithout the back brace and without proper exercise and therapy, Mr. Hopeโs back pain increased.  \nDespite past orders for physical therapy and an MRI, TDCJ provided only ibuprofen, which \ncontinued to be the primary method of treatment for years to come.\n157. By early 2023, Mr. Hopeโs daily life had become undeniably restricted by his back \npain, which by then was worsening into his hip.  Mr. Hopeโs complaints led a health care provider \nto order an MRI and look into additional and alternative methods of care.  Mr. Hopeโs MRI \nrevealed multilevel degenerative changes in his spine, for which a doctor ordered physical therapy \nin or around August 2023 (although Mr. Hope has not yet had a physical therapy session to date).  \n51\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 59 of 80 PageID #:\n671\nWhile this physical therapy is vital for improving Mr. Hopeโs quality of life, the transportation to \nand from his physical therapy sessions requires 12 hours of being handcuffed in the transport \nvehicleโadditional exposure to hardship that could have been avoided if addressed sooner.\n158. Mr. Hope contends with shoulder and knee pain arising from his extended time in \nsolitary confinement.  There, Mr. Hope had to be handcuffed to leave his cell.  While this restraint \nwas imposed for regular activities, it was also imposed during the hundreds of times Mr. Hope was \nmoved to a new cell with no apparent security purpose, as well as the numerous times he was \ncuffed because he was kept in solitary after he was no longer an escape risk and after the SCC first \ndecided he could be released to G.P. in 2007.  To be handcuffed, Mr. Hope had to crouch down, \nface  the  back  of  his  cell,  and  extend  his  wrists  behind  him  towards  the  slot  in  his  door \napproximately two feet off the ground.  Repeatedly assuming this unnatural position placed \nenormous strain on Mr. Hopeโs shoulder and knees, leading to persistent pain.  In or around \nDecember 2020, Mr. Hope received a steroid shot in his left shoulder, which helped, but he was \nprevented by prison staff from regularly receiving that treatment.  \nC. Insomnia\n159. Mr. Hope began suffering from intense nightmares and then insomnia when he was \nhoused with death row inmates at Polunsky starting in 2007.  In his nightmares, TDCJ officials \nmixed him up with death row prisoners and came to take him to his execution.  Over time, his \nsleeplessness worsened to the point where he was lucky to get even four hours of interrupted sleep \nin a night.  The conditions of solitary only made matters worse: At virtually all times of the day \nand night, other prisoners would bang on doors, talk to themselves, or yell or urinate through their \ncells.  Guards came and went at all hours, causing gates to bang and slam.  Self-harm and suicide \nattempts are, sadly, prevalent in solitary confinement, causing further disruptions.  These factors \nwere compounded by the frequent cell moves, which could and sometimes did occur in the middle \n52\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 60 of 80 PageID #:\n672\nof the night, and that left him constantly disoriented, making the new noises and voices impossible \nto ignore.  Throughout the years there were many nights when he was unable to sleep at all.  To \nthis day, Mr. Hope continues to suffer from insomnia.   \nD. Other Psychological Harm\n160. Mr. Hope suffered significant psychological harms attributable to Defendantsโ \nactions (or inactions as the case may be).  Mr. Hope has experienced, for example, lasting anxiety, \ndepression, obsessive compulsions, suicidal ideations, and emotional numbness.  In or around late \n2014, Mr. Hope began experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations.24  At times, Mr. Hope has \nresorted to biting his own arm to remind himself he was alive.  \n161. Some of Mr. Hopeโs psychological harm is unsurprising, as the debilitating effects \nof solitary confinement are well-established and widely recognized.  For example, scholars have \nrepeatedly documented symptoms from solitary confinement to include โsevere anxiety or panic \ndisorder, disordered thinking including paranoia, compulsive activities including pacing and \nrepeatedly cleaning the cell, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, agitation, irritability, \nhyperawareness, strong startle reaction, mounting irrational anger, impairment of judgement, \ndespair and suicidal inclinations.โ25  Likewise, researchers have documented how such symptoms \n24 When Mr. Hope raised his concerns with mental health staffโhoping they could offer some \ninsight or understandingโthey offered only medication, which Mr. Hope declined, fearing the \nside effects of heavy psychotropic drugs.\n25 Terry A. Kupers, Supermax Prison Isolation in Pre-Crime Society, in THE PRE-CRIME SOCIETY \n293-94 (Bruce Arrigo & Brian Sellers eds., 2021).\n53\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 61 of 80 PageID #:\n673\ncan be long-lasting, all the way up to increased risk of death,26 and sufficient to constitute a SHU \nPost-Release Syndrome.27\n162. Indeed, in 2014, Lance Lowry, the president of AFSCME Local 3807, the union \nrepresenting Texas correctional employees, called for regulation to limit solitary confinement \nbecause of the effects: โ[r]esearch shows that depriving inmates of human contact for long periods \nof time may exacerbate mental crisis, assaultive behavior, antisocial behaviors, and acute health \ndisorders.  Psychological effects due to lack of sensory stimulation can include anxiety, depression, \nanger,  cognitive  disturbances,  perceptual  distortions,  obsessive  thoughts,  paranoia,  and \npsychosis.โ28\n163. Defendants  compounded  these  effects  as  Mr.  Hope  remained  in  solitary  for \nadditional years and was subjected to traumatic incidents and inhumane conditions.  For example, \nand in addition to other examples noted in previous sections:\n๏ท In 2007, while housed with those on death row, Mr. Hope started to experience \na sense of suspended animation and despair that has come to be known as \nโDeath Row Syndrome.โ  His neighbors were sentenced to death, and he felt at \nthe same time deeply affected yet also unmoved by their deaths.  Even after \nthen-Texas Senator Whitmire intervened on Mr. Hopeโs behalf to have him \nmoved off of death row, Mr. Hope still felt haunted by the experience.  Death \n26 Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, Josie Sivaraman, David L. Rosen, Association of Restrictive \nHousing During Incarceration With Mortality After Release, 2 JAMA OPEN NETWORK 19 (Oct. 4, \n2019).\n27 Terry A. Kupers, The SHU Post-Release Syndrome: A Preliminary Report, 14 CORRECTIONAL \nMENTAL HEALTH REP. 6, 81 (Mar./Apr. 2016). \n28 Statement of Lance L. Lowry, AFSCME Texas Correctional Employees Local 3807 (Feb. 25, \n2014), https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lance-Lowry-Senate-Hearing-\nSubmission.pdf. \n54\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 62 of 80 PageID #:\n674\nrow prisoners would still be walked by Mr. Hopeโs cell on their way to being \nexecuted.  Mr. Hope would be overwhelmed by despair, comparing his own \nlack of hope to theirs. He projected their fate onto his own experience of slow \ndeath by the state.\n๏ท Frequent cell moves triggered obsessive compulsions for Mr. Hope.  Moving \nso often required him to prioritize his belongings so he could more quickly pack \nand unpack them with each new cell.  Mr. Hope began to feel as if he were \nliving in a puzzle, and if any one thing were out of place, it caused him immense \ndistress.  He became so familiar with his small inventory of belongings that, for \nexample, he was able to identify when address pages were confiscated from his \nnotebook but not properly recorded on property forms.  \n๏ท To this day, Mr. Hope panics when he sees discoloring or spots on the walls.  \nBecause of his many, many cell moves, in particular to cells covered in mold, \nMr. Hope was constantly disoriented and on high alert for additional signs of \nmold or other health hazards.  Mr. Hope would even question if spots on the \nwall were real.  It was an unsettling feeling, as all the cells looked the same, and \nhe had been in so many that were alike, save for small differences like a chip in \nthe paint or discoloration of the floor, and he began to, and continues to, fixate \non such differences.  \n๏ท Even now in G.P., certain scenarios continue to trigger Mr. Hope, causing \nsignificant distress and conjuring traumatic memories.\n164. During Mr. Hopeโs time in solitary, he was denied meaningful mental health care.  \nMr. Hope wanted to work through years of trauma from his time at Polunsky rather than be overly \n55\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 63 of 80 PageID #:\n675\nmedicated, which seemed common around him.  But he was denied enrollment in a mental health \ndiversion program because he refused heavy-duty psychiatric medications, as was his right, and \nseemingly also because of the ambiguous โhigh profileโ designation that still has not been \nexplained to him.  Still, Mr. Hope expressed concerns about his mental health, including in letters \nas well as a grievance, which Defendant Harris denied, writing that no action was warranted.  \n165. Mr. Hopeโs mental health crises required serious attention and could not be fixed \nwith a simple prescription. In 2021, Mr. Hope wrote a note that epitomized his struggle: โI have \nnow been in this cell 33 days without recreation.  I have been in isolation for over 26 years.  My \ndepression has gotten worse . . . [and] my bouts with anxiety are daily . . . . There are times I am \nhearing voices and seeing things that arenโt there. . . .  I need to talk to someone about how to \nmanage these things.โ  In response, Mr. Hope was โseen cell sideโ but medical staff merely \nsuggested he keep himself occupied as a distraction.\n166. Even after Mr. Hopeโs release to G.P., he continues to suffer the physical and \nmental effects of Defendantsโ mistreatment over his decades of isolation.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nCruel and Unusual Punishment Under the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\nBased on Conditions of Solitary Confinement\n(Polunsky Defendants and Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n167.  Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as though fully set forth herein.\n168. The Eighth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, prohibits โcruel \nand unusual punishments.โ  U.S. Const. amend. VIII.  In its prohibition on such punishments, the \nEighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement.  See, \ne.g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).  Conditions of confinement within a prison \nviolate the Eighth Amendment when (1) the conditions, either alone or in combination, pose a \n56\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 64 of 80 PageID #:\n676\nsufficiently serious threat to a prisonerโs health or safety, such that a prisoner is deprived of the \nminimal measure of lifeโs necessities and (2) prison officials act with deliberate indifference to the \nthreat.  Id. at 834; see also Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 304 (1991).\n169. Solitary confinement is a form of punishment that implicates Eighth Amendment \nconcerns when paired with other intolerable conditions.  Although not dispositive, the length of \ntime in solitary confinement โcannot be ignoredโ in deciding whether conditions of confinement \nmeet constitutional standards.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686-87 (1978).\n170. Forcing Mr. Hope to live alone for 27 years in unsanitary environments and, at \ntimes, without even minimum necessities (e.g., a blanket in February, a single set of clothing, a \ndry cell, etc.) constituted serious deprivations of the basic needs for safe and sanitary living \nconditions, for hygiene, for sleep and healthcare, and for meaningful human interaction, among \nothers.  Such deprivations were worsened by the extreme length of time Mr. Hope spent in \ninhumane conditions in solitary confinement and by the excessive number of cell moves.  \n171. Beginning in 2007, when Mr. Hope was first housed in solitary confinement at \nPolunsky, and especially after 2012 when Mr. Hope was moved to over 260 different cells, Mr. \nHope was repeatedly housed in deplorable conditions and routinely exposed to urine, feces, vomit, \nrats, roaches, and mold, without the ability to properly disinfect and clean his cells.  As a few \nexamples of the many inhospitable or dangerous cells Mr. Hope was confined in, one cellโs wall \nwas so covered with mold that Mr. Hope initially thought the wall was charred, another had no \nworking lights, and still others exposed Mr. Hope to extreme temperatures or leaked water when \nit rained.  No prisoner should experience these conditions, yet Mr. Hope was forced to endure these \nconditions while simultaneously being deprived of the ability to participate in prison programming, \nwork a job, and participate in the meaningful human interaction that is a part of G.P.  Worse still, \n57\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 65 of 80 PageID #:\n677\nand again unlike what he would have experienced if housed in G.P., Mr. Hope had no way to \nescape the unsanitary conditions present in many of his tiny cells because he was confined to his \ncell for almost every minute of every day.\n172. Mr. Hopeโs physical and mental health declined.  Mr. Hope frequently became ill \nfrom exposure to mold, filth, and cold.  He experienced, among other ailments, depression, \nhopelessness, despair, suicidal ideation, and hallucinations.  He began to suffer, and still suffers, \nfrom chronic insomnia.  Mr. Hope developed lasting, chronic back pain exacerbated by years of \nrestricted movement and protracted shoulder and knee pain due to being repeatedly handcuffed \nthrough his cell door at an unnatural angle, a condition that is unique to solitary confinement.\n173. Polunsky Defendants Rehse and Harris were aware of the inhumane conditions Mr. \nHope endured, and the serious risks such conditions posed.  Mr. Rehse authorized many of Mr. \nHopeโs cell transfers, and Mr. Rehse was familiar with the deplorable conditions within those \ncellsโincluding because Mr. Hope personally showed Mr. Rehse mold in his cell.  Mr. Hope \npersonally made Mr. Rehse and Mr. Harris aware of his frequent moves and the dangerous \nconditions within those cells, and Mr. Hope filed multiple grievances about his cell conditions.  \nDespite their knowledge, Mr. Rehse and Mr. Harris did nothing to prevent or alleviate the \ninhumane conditions and instead continued to move him, even placing Mr. Hope in five different \ncells containing mold in one three-week period in 2017.  Nor did either Polunsky Defendant help \nMr. Hope access mental health care (even after Mr. Hope expressed concerns to them about \nneeding help), take meaningful steps to transition Mr. Hope out of solitary, or decrease the rate of \nhis unnecessary cell moves.  The Polunsky Defendantsโ awareness of the deplorable conditions of \nconfinement and refusal to remedy them constituted significant deprivations of basic human needs, \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment.  \n58\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 66 of 80 PageID #:\n678\n174. The Classification Defendants were likewise aware of the deplorable conditions \nMr. Hope experienced.  Mr. Hope raised these conditions to the Classification Defendants, both \ndirectly and indirectly through advocates, at SCC review hearings, in letters and emails, and on \nphone calls.  The Classification Defendants also had significant experience within the prison \nsystem to understand the unique hardships imposed by solitary confinement and the negative \nhealth effects of extended time in isolation.  Yet the Classification Defendants ignored this \nknowledge and instead relegated Mr. Hope to remain in these deplorable conditions and in \nsegregation for year after year.\n175. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants were also part of a \nconspiracy directed, in part, at keeping Mr. Hope in solitary indefinitely which increased the length \nof time he was confined under inhumane conditions.  As entrants into the conspiracy, each shares \nresponsibility.  Bevill v. Fletcher, 26 F.4th 270, 283-84 (5th Cir. 2022). \n176. The Polunsky Defendants and Classification Defendants knew about the inhumane \nand  unsanitary  conditions  of  Mr.  Hopeโs  confinement  and  acted  with  malice  or  reckless \nindifference to Mr. Hopeโs rights by, among other acts, failing to remedy the deplorable conditions.  \n177. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages against \nthe Polunsky Defendants and Classification Defendants to make him whole for the years of pain \nand suffering he experienced while relegated to solitary confinement in such conditions. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nRetaliation Under the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n(Polunsky Defendant Rehse and Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n178. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as if fully set forth herein.\n179. The  First  Amendment,  enforceable  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983,  prohibits \nretaliation against a prisoner for engaging in a protected activity.  U.S. Const. amend. I.  A prisoner \n59\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 67 of 80 PageID #:\n679\nwill prevail on a claim for retaliation if he establishes (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the \ndefendantโs intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory \nadverse act, and (4) causation.  See, e.g., Morris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2006).\n180. Filing grievances against prison staff is protected First Amendment activity.  See, \ne.g., Woods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir. 1995).  \n181. Contacting outside advocates as part of oneโs right to use the mail to access the \ncourts and government officials is protected First Amendment activity.  See, e.g., Woods, 60 F.3d \nat 1164 (exercising oneโs right of access to the courts is protected First Amendment activity); \nTaylor v. Sterrett, 532 F.2d 462, 470 (5th Cir. 1976) (agreeing that mail is protected from \ncensorship when transmitted between prisoners and courts, governmental agencies, lawyers, or \npress because such protection is โcompelled by the constitutional rights of the prisonersโ).\n182. Communicating with the media is protected First Amendment activity.  See, e.g., \nPell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974); Taylor, 532 F.2d at 479, 481.\n183. Mr. Hope engaged in protected First Amendment activity.  He filed grievances, \nspoke with the media, asked advocates to speak on his behalf, and wrote letters to TDCJ and state \nofficials, including to the Classification Defendants, starting no later than 2011.  \n184. The  Classification  Defendants  were  aware  of  Mr.  Hopeโs  protected  First \nAmendment activity.  Indeed, they were the recipients of many of Mr. Hopeโs and his advocatesโ \nletters, phone calls, and emails.  Mr. Hope also filed grievances about SCC review hearings \nconducted by Classification Defendants Bennett, Enloe, and Fiveash, as well as about the SCC and \nclassification generally.  Polunsky Defendant Rehse was aware of Mr. Hopeโs protected activity, \nincluding from Mr. Rehseโs participation in Mr. Hopeโs review hearings.  Other co-conspirators \n60\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 68 of 80 PageID #:\n680\nalso knew of Mr. Hopeโs protected activity; letters were sent to and grievances filed about Ms. \nJones, and Mr. Hope filed grievances and spoke to officials about Mr. McMullenโs actions.   \n185. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants were on notice under \ndecades-old caselaw that filing grievances, reaching out to and through outside advocates, and \nspeaking to the media is protected First Amendment activity.  Moreover, Defendants had notice \nthat prisoners have these rights based on TDCJโs own policies and trainings.\n186. The Classification Defendants, especially Classification Defendant White, were \nnonetheless  angered  by  Mr.  Hopeโs  protected  activity.    The  Classification  Defendants  and \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse intended to retaliate against Mr. Hope and warned Mr. Hope against \ncontinuing his protected activities.  For example, Polunsky Defendant Rehse remarked, in sum or \nin substance, that Mr. Hope was his own worst enemy, indicating his conditions were tied with his \nefforts to challenge his segregation conditions.  Classification Defendant Enloe was known to \nappear at Mr. Hopeโs SCC review hearings only during periods when Mr. Hope and his advocates \nwere being the most vocal.  And Ms. Enloe, at the direction of Ms. White, communicated to Mr. \nHope that having his advocates contact classification would not benefit Mr. Hope.\n187. In reaction to Mr. Hopeโs protected First Amendment activity, the Classification \nDefendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse retaliated against Mr. Hope.  Their retaliatory acts \nincluded, but were not limited to, extending Mr. Hopeโs solitary confinement indefinitely, planting \na screwdriver in his cell and using the resulting manufactured disciplinary charges as excuses for \nhis continued segregation, and relocating Mr. Hope to hundreds of different cells.  These retaliatory \nactions often followed soon after Mr. Hope had engaged in a protected activity and were designed \nto discourage Mr. Hope from continuing to exercise his First Amendment rights.\n61\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 69 of 80 PageID #:\n681\n188. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants were also part of a \nconspiracy that was directed, in part, at punishing Mr. Hope for challenging his confinement \nconditions and Defendantsโ actions toward him, and at silencing Mr. Hope and his advocates so \ntheir actions could go undetected.  Defendantsโ co-conspirators carried out additional retaliatory \nacts against Mr. Hope in furtherance of the conspiracy, such as by confiscating Mr. Hopeโs \ntypewriter that he used to type grievances and by moving a chemical-covered Mr. Hope into a cell \nwith a disabled sink so he had no way to clean himself for a week-long period.  As entrants into \nthe  conspiracy,  Polunsky  Defendant  Rehse  and  the  Classification  Defendants  each  share \nresponsibility for their co-conspiratorsโ acts.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 283-84. \n189. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants knew of Mr. Hopeโs \nright to engage in First Amendment activity, yet retaliated against Mr. Hope for such activity and \ndid so with malice or reckless indifference to Mr. Hopeโs rights, including, extending Mr. Hopeโs \ntime in solitary indefinitely, manufacturing disciplinary charges, confiscating his typewriter, and \nmoving him to hundreds of cells, among other acts as pled in this complaint.\n190. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages against \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants for repeatedly retaliating against him \nand causing him pain and suffering due to his participation in protected First Amendment activity.\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nViolation of Procedural Due Process Under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n(Polunsky Defendant Rehse and Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n191. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as if fully incorporated herein.\n192. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable via 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, provides that no state shall deprive any person of liberty without due process of law.  U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV.  To determine what process is due, a court determines whether there is a \n62\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 70 of 80 PageID #:\n682\nliberty interest that has been interfered with by the state, and whether the procedures โattendant \nupon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.โ  Richardson v. Tex. Secโy of State, 978 F.3d \n220, 228-29 (5th Cir. 2020).  The constitutional sufficiency of procedures is determined by \nweighing three factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the \nrisk of erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used, and (3) the stateโs \ninterest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that additional \nor substitute procedures would entail.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).\n193. Prison officials must engage in the periodic review of the confinement of prisoners \nin segregation and may not use segregation โas a pretext for indefinite confinement.โ  Hewitt, 459 \nU.S.  at  477  n.9.    Periodic  reviews,  like  any  process  that  is  constitutionally  due,  must  be \nโmeaningful.โ  See, e.g., Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965).\n194. Conversely,  if  an  official  engages  in  โperfunctory  exchangesโ  regarding  a \nprisonerโs eligibility for release from solitary and fails to explain their reasoning for retaining a \nprisoner in solitary, then the official has failed to provide adequate due process.  Wilkerson v. \nStalder, No. 00-304-JJB, 2013 WL 6665452, at *11 (M.D. La. Dec. 17, 2013), affโd sub nom. \nWilkerson  v.  Goodwin,  774  F.3d  845  (5th  Cir.  2014).    Periodic  reviews  are  similarly  not \nmeaningful if the decisionmaker at the review either lacks or disclaims the authority to release the \nperson being โreviewedโ from segregation.  See Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, 1366 (S.D. \nTex. 1980), affโd in part, revโd in part on other grounds, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir. 1982), amended \nin part, vacated in part on other grounds, 688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1982).\n195. Mr. Hope established a liberty interest due to his indefinite placement in solitary \nwithout eligibility for parole.  Hope v. Harris, 861 F. Appโx 571, 580 (5th Cir. 2021); see also \nWilkerson, 774 F.3d at 853, 856 (recognizing that solitary confinement that causes โatypical and \n63\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 71 of 80 PageID #:\n683\nsignificant hardship,โ including hardship due to an extraordinary length of time in segregation, is \nsufficient to demonstrate a liberty interest).\n196. Mr. Hope had a strong interest in meaningful review for placement in G.P. as \nopposed to solitary confinement.  Within prison systems, including TDCJ, the difference in \ntreatment of and resources available to prisoners between solitary and G.P. is marked, including \nthat G.P. provides social contact with others, space to move, and access to programming such as \nreligious services and vocational trainingโwhich are significant in parole consideration.  \n197. Mr. Hope faced a high risk of, and in fact experienced, an erroneous deprivation of \nthis liberty interest through the procedures used: his SCC review hearings were a mere sham, with \nprocedures that could be, and were repeatedly, tampered with at the whim of the Classification \nDefendants.    \n198. From 1995 until 2022, Mr. Hope attended an SCC review hearing approximately \nevery six months, or roughly 56 times, to have his classification reviewed.  Throughout that time, \nmultiple SCC members told Mr. Hope that they saw no reason not to release him to G.P.  At least \ntwo SCC members, on three separate occasions, told Mr. Hope that they decided to release him.  \nBut, each time, the Classification Defendants or their co-conspirators interfered, citing that they \nlacked the power to actually authorize the change.  The SCCโs decisions were inexplicably \nreversed by committees or administrators outside the appeals process and who Mr. Hope was not \nable to petition.  The Classification Defendants told Mr. Hope that there was nothing he could do \nto challenge this outcome and, as such, he would never get out of solitary.  Given that the \ndecisionmakers at the dozens of hearings Mr. Hope attended lacked or disclaimed the authority to \nrelease him, such process amounted to nothing more than sham hearings.\n64\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 72 of 80 PageID #:\n684\n199. Classification Defendants Enloe, Bennett, and Fiveash, and others presiding over \nMr. Hopeโs periodic reviews, did not articulate reasoning as to why he continued to be housed for \nyears on end in segregation.  Instead, the Classification Defendants manufactured shifting and \ncontradictory justifications for his continued segregation, including his long-ago escape and \nundocumented designations as โhigh profileโ or โunusual and difficult.โ  Engaging only in \nperfunctory exchanges, the Classification Defendants never offered Mr. Hope an explanation of \nhow or why these designations were applied, what they meant, or how they could be removed or \nchallenged.  In essence, and as admitted by at least one SCC member, the SCC review hearings \nwere mere โwelfare checksโ and little more than a rubber stamp on the Classification Defendantsโ \npre-determined decision to keep Mr. Hope isolatedโin short, sham decisions.  \n200. Classification Defendants Echessa and White similarly received multiple letters, \nphone calls, emails, grievances, and pleas from Mr. Hope and his advocates, but each continued \nrejecting or ignoring Mr. Hopeโs claims of due process violations.  Both Mr. Echessa and Ms. \nWhite had supervisory authority over Mr. Hopeโs periodic review hearings and authorized the \nperfunctory review hearings that kept Mr. Hope in segregation without constitutionally adequate \nprocess.  As Mr. Treon told the media, the Director of Classification decided Mr. Hope โwill never \nget out of Seg.โ  Mr. Echessa and Ms. White could have corrected these constitutional violations \nbut instead allowed Mr. Hope to languish in solitary based on sham โhearings.โ \n201. Mr. Hope was released from solitary confinement only after he filed a petition for \ncertiorari with the Supreme Court.  The alleged February 2022 review hearing where this release \ndecision was made (of which Mr. Hope received no notice or decision) was scheduled irregularly \nand seemingly only as a litigation tactic to avoid liability for injunctive relief.\n65\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 73 of 80 PageID #:\n685\n202. Polunsky Defendant Rehse was part of the SCC panel at three of Mr. Hopeโs SCC \nreview hearings that lacked due process.  Mr. Rehse also joined in a conspiracy to deprive Mr. \nHope of his due process rights.  As a member of the conspiracy, Mr. Rehse shares in the \nresponsibility for this constitutional deprivation.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 283-84. \n203. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants knew Mr. Hope was \nentitled to periodic reviews of his confinement in solitary, and they acted with malice or reckless \nindifference to that right by, among other actions pled in the complaint, reversing SCC decisions \nto release Mr. Hope from solitary, disclaiming authority to release Mr. Hope from solitary, and \nfailing to provide justification for Mr. Hopeโs indefinite confinement.\n204. Mr. Hope seeks compensatory and punitive damages against the Classification \nDefendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse for the pain and suffering he faced while indefinitely \nrelegated to segregation, with no ability to rejoin G.P. or be released on parole. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nConspiracy Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n(Polunsky Defendant Rehse and All Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n205. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as though fully set forth herein.\n206. Conspiring to deprive someone of their constitutional rights is prohibited under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983.  A plaintiff will prevail on a claim for conspiracy if he establishes: (1) an agreement \namong the alleged co-conspirators to deprive the plaintiff of a constitutional right and (2) that the \nalleged deprivation actually occurred.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 274-75.  \n207. Plausibly alleging conspiracy merely requires โenough facts to raise a reasonable \nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.โ  See id. at 284; see also Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007).  Evidence of a common motive among co-\nconspirators contributes to the plausibility of such a claim.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 284 (holding that \n66\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 74 of 80 PageID #:\n686\nplaintiff satisfied the pleading requirement on his conspiracy claim by alleging that co-conspirators \nwere motivated to protect their reputations and had โworked closely with one anotherโ).\n208. A conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 acts โas the legal mechanism through \nwhich to impose liability on each and all of the Defendants without regard to the person doing the \nparticular act.โ  Nesmith v. Alford, 318 F.2d 110, 126 (5th Cir. 1963).  Thus, โregardless of whether \nor not [a defendantโs] actions alone actually caused a constitutional violation, liability can still be \nimposed on [his] alleged membership in [the] conspiracy.โ  Latiolais v. Cravins, 484 F. Appโx \n983, 991 (5th Cir. 2012).\n209. Additionally, โ[a] coconspirator is bound by the overt acts of other coconspirators \nfurthering the conspiracy both before and after being enlisted even though he may not participate \nin each overt act.โ  In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 623 F. Supp. 2d 798, 830-\n31 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (quoting U.S. v. Spudic, 795 F.2d 1334, 1337 (7th Cir.1986)); see also United \nStates v. Rodriguez-Lopez, 756 F.3d 422, 430 (5th Cir. 2014).\n210. The Classification Defendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse conspired to deny \nMr.  Hope  of  his  rights  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States \nConstitution.\n211. The  Classification  Defendants,  Polunsky  Defendant  Rehse,  and  their  co-\nconspirators shared a common motive for retaliating against Mr. Hope: to protect their personal \nreputations and careers.  First, Mr. Hopeโs advocacy, both on his own and through outside \nadvocates, invited public scrutiny to Defendantsโ and their co-conspiratorsโ actions and threatened \ntheir personal and professional reputations.  Second, Defendants and their co-conspirators had \npersonal vendettas against Mr. Hope, as they still harbored resentment due to Mr. Hopeโs escape \nin the early 1990s.  Mr. Hopeโs ability to outsmart the system was a huge embarrassment for those \n67\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 75 of 80 PageID #:\n687\nwhose profession it was to keep him incarcerated.  Third, once their misconduct had begun, Mr. \nHopeโs willingness to file grievances and write letters to SCC, TDCJ, and state officials could lead \nto internal investigations and Defendants and their co-conspirators were motivated to protect their \ncareers and reputations.\n212. The Classification Defendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse worked closely with \neach other and with their co-conspirators.  All were employed in the same prison system and had \nthe  opportunity  to  easily  meet  and  communicate  with  one  another.    Further,  many  of  the \nDefendants  and  co-conspirators  reported  to  one  another  in  the  systemโs  official  hierarchy.  \nClassification Defendant Echessa, for example, was Classification Defendant Whiteโs supervisor, \nwho in turn was Classification Defendant Enloeโs superior. \n213. Defendants and their co-conspirators sought to silence Mr. Hope by manufacturing \nreasons to keep him in solitary, inflicting pain and suffering, and breaking Mr. Hopeโs will to \nprotest.  \n214. Although they did not succeed in breaking Mr. Hopeโs will, Defendants actually \ndenied Mr. Hope his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution.\n215. Since 2011, members of the conspiracy, in agreement with or at the direction of \ntheir co-conspirators:\na. Subjected Mr. Hope to sham hearings with a pre-determined outcome, denied \ntheir ability to release Mr. Hope from segregation, and reversed, or allowed to \nbe reversed, SCC decisions requiring that Mr. Hope be released to G.P.;\nb. Fabricated disciplinary cases in order to justify keeping Mr. Hope in solitary;\n68\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 76 of 80 PageID #:\n688\nc. Confiscated Mr. Hopeโs typewriter, which he used to file grievances and \ncommunicate with advocates, and tampered with his legal communications and \nother advocacy-related documents;\nd. Subjected Mr. Hope to a chemical agent, without allowing him to clean off the \nchemicals for multiple days, in order to deter Mr. Hope from further advocacy;\ne. Moved Mr. Hope from cell to cell in order to disorient him and undermine his \nability to advocate for himself;\nf. Continued to rubber-stamp Mr. Hopeโs confinement in deplorable conditions, \nwhich were known to be harmfulโfor 17 additional years after any penological \njustification for keeping him in solitary confinement had evaporatedโalthough \nthey had the power to authorize Mr. Hopeโs move to G.P.\n216. The conspiracy to retaliate against Mr. Hope and deprive him of his due process \nrights spanned many years.  All Defendants involved in any portion of the conspiracy are liable \nbecause of their membership in it. \n217. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants conspired to, and did, \ndeprive Mr. Hope of his constitutional rights.  In planning and executing their conspiracy, \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants acted with malice or reckless \nindifference to Mr. Hopeโs rights by, among other actions pled in this complaint, agreeing โneverโ \nto release him, disregarding his requests for help, and fabricating disciplinary cases against him.\n218. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages against \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants for the harm inflicted against him \nthrough their conspiracy to deprive him of his constitutional rights.\n69\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 77 of 80 PageID #:\n689\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nCruel and Unusual Punishment Under the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\nBased on Excessive Force\n(All Ellis Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n219. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as though fully set forth herein.\n220. As described, the Eighth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \nprohibits โcruel and unusual punishments.โ  U.S. Const. amend. VIII.  In claims under the Eighth \nAmendment arising from the use of excessive force, the โcore judicial inquiryโ is โwhether force \nwas applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically \nto cause harm,โ or more simply, whether the defendant had a subjective intent to punish.  Cowart \nv. Erwin, 837 F.3d 444, 452 (5th Cir. 2016) (citing Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1992)).  \nThe officialโs intent in applying force is โdetermined by reference to the well-known Hudson \nfactorsโthe extent of injury suffered, the need for application of force, the relationship between \nthat need and the amount of force used, the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible officials, \nand any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.โ  Id. at 452-53 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).\n221. Ellis Defendants Simmons and Clark violated Mr. Hopeโs clearly established \nEighth Amendment rights when they applied and maintained overly tightened handcuffs to Mr. \nHopeโs wrists for more than 24 hours while he suffered from pneumonia and struggled to breathe.  \nThis use of excessive force caused Mr. Hope severe pain and lasting damage.\n222. Ellis Defendant Simmons was responsible for preparing Mr. Hope for an immediate \ntransfer by ambulance.  Ms. Simmons knew Mr. Hope needed urgent medical care.  Despite that \nknowledge, Ms. Simmons took steps to delay his transfer.  After Sergeant Schwartz properly \napplied handcuffs to Mr. Hopeโs wrists, Ms. Simmons had the restraints removed so that she could \n70\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 78 of 80 PageID #:\n690\nimproperly reapply the handcuffs, this time clamping the metal so tightly that Mr. Hopeโs wrists \nand hands lost circulation, feeling, and their normal color.\n223. When Ellis Defendant Clark took control at the hospital, nurses pointed out to Mr. \nClark multiple times that Mr. Hopeโs wrists and hands were discolored and losing circulation, and \nthe nurses asked Mr. Clark why the handcuffs were so tight.  Mr. Clark responded only with vague \nreferences to having a reason for hurting Mr. Hope and with demands that the nurses let Mr. Clark \nhandle security without questions.  For the next 24 hours, the restraints were not adjusted and Mr. \nHope experienced severe discomfort, lost feeling in his wrists and hands, and his wrists bled.  The \nrestraints were only corrected when a doctor involved Warden Strong to direct the handcuffs be \napplied correctly.\n224. The Ellis Defendants inflicted this pain on Mr. Hope wantonly and with complete \ndisregard for the risk of harm their actions posed.  Each Ellis Defendant knew that Mr. Hope was \nexperiencing respiratory distress requiring emergency medical attention, that the handcuffs were \napplied too tightly, and that the excessive restraint would or had caused Mr. Hope pain and \ndiscomfort and to lose color and feeling in his hands.\n225. The need for application of force was low.  Mr. Hope was in respiratory distress, \nwas compliant, and was seeking necessary emergency medical care.  The Ellis Defendants knew \nthe wrist handcuffs were only one of multiple security measures in place, as Mr. Hope was also in \nankle and waist shackles and was accompanied by officers at all times.  Yet the Ellis Defendants \nmade no efforts to temper their responses.  Their excessive use of force against Mr. Hope was done \nmaliciously and sadistically and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. \n226. Mr. Hope suffers from lasting numbness and pain in his wrists and hands. \n71\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 79 of 80 PageID #:\n691\n227. The Ellis Defendants knew of the risks posed by an excessive use of force against \nMr. Hope, and they acted with malice or reckless indifference towards Mr. Hopeโs rights by, \namong other acts pled in the complaint, applying and maintaining overly-tightened handcuffs to \nMr. Hopeโs wrists for more than 24 hours, despite medical staff pointing out the deleterious effects.\n228. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages from Ellis \nDefendants Simmons and Clark for inflicting cruel and unusual punishment against him while he \nsought emergency medical treatment.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Mr. Hope demands the following relief against Defendants, jointly and \nseverally:\nA.

Cayce \nClerk \n \nDennis Wayne Hope,  \n \nPlaintiffโAppellant, \n \nversus \n \nTodd Harris; Chad Rehse; Leonard Eschessa; Joni \nWhite; Kelly Enloe; Melissa Benet; B. Fiveash,  \n \nDefendantsโAppellees. \n \n \nAppeal from the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Texas \nUSDC No. 9:18-CV-27 \n \n \nBefore King, Smith, and Haynes, Circuit Judges. \nPer Curiam:*\nIn this case, a prisoner, proceeding pro se, filed an action under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, challenging, inter alia, various aspects of his imprisonment \nin  solitary  confinement  under  the  Fourteenth,  First,  and  Eighth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution. The district court, adopting the \n \n* Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this \nopinion  should  not  be  published  and  is  not  precedent  except  under  the  limited \ncircumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4. \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 2     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nmagistrate judgeโs report and recommendation, dismissed all claims with \nprejudice. Now, with counsel, the prisoner appeals. For the reasons that \nfollow, we AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND for further \nproceedings.  \nI. \nPlaintiff-appellant  Dennis  Wayne  Hope  is  a  prisoner  in  solitary \nconfinement in the Security Housing Unit at the Polunsky Unit within the \nTexas  Department  of  Criminal  Justice.  Hope  alleges  that  he  has  been \ncontinuously held in solitary confinement in a cell โno larger than a parking \nspaceโ  twenty-three  to  twenty-four  hours  a  day  for  over  two  decades. \nAccording to Hope, he has been told that because he escaped from prison in \n1994, he will remain in solitary confinement, even though he alleges that his \nโescape  riskโ  designation  was  removed  in  2005.  He  claims  that  the \ncommittee  meetings  that  review  his  ongoing  solitary  confinement  are  a \nโsham.โ Moreover, Hope has alleged that since he filed a grievance about \nvarious conditions, he has been moved between cells over 263 times and has \nhad his typewriter confiscated. Finally, Hope claims, inter alia, that the \ndecades of solitary confinement in a cell that sometimes has feces, urine, and \nblack  mold  on  the  walls,  floor,  and  doors  have  led  to  his  physical  and \npsychological deterioration.  \nHope, originally proceeding pro se, filed this lawsuit against seven \nprison officials: Senior Warden Todd Harris, Major Chad Rehse, Deputy \nDirector of Support Operations Leonard Eschessa, Assistant Director of \nClassifications Joni White, and three state classification committee members, \nKelly  Enloe,  Melissa  Benet,  and  Bonnie  Fiveash  (collectively, \nโDefendantsโ). Specifically, Hope brought a procedural due process claim \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and a retaliation claim under the First \nAmendment. He also brought an Eighth Amendment claim, alleging that the \n2 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 3     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nconditions, including the duration, of his solitary confinement constitute \ncruel  and  unusual  punishment.  A  magistrate  judge  recommended  that \nHopeโs complaint be dismissed for lack of standing but then proceeded to \nanalyze the merits of Hopeโs claims, recommending that they be dismissed \nwith prejudice. The district court, after a de novo review, overruled Hopeโs \nobjections, adopted the magistrate judgeโs report and recommendation, and \ndismissed Hopeโs complaint with prejudice. Hope timely appealed with \ncounsel.1 \nII. \nWe review a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. \nJTB Tools & Oilfield Servs., L.L.C. v. United States, 831 F.3d 597, 599 (5th \nCir. 2016). The jurisdictional questions presented here are two-fold: (1) \nwhether  Hope  has  standing  to  bring  this  action  and  (2)  whether  state \nsovereign immunity bars this action. Important, too, to this jurisdictional \ninquiry is the fact that Hope brought both official-capacity and individual-\ncapacity claims. We discuss each in turn. \nA. There  is  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  Hopeโs  official-capacity \nclaims. \nHope is a prisoner challenging the conditions of his confinement, and \nhis classification within the prison system in an action against various prison \nofficials. This is the prototypical mix of defendants in such cases. Cf. Morris \nv. Livingston, 739 F.3d 740, 746 (5th Cir. 2014) (dismissing the Governor \nfrom a prisonerโs action for, inter alia, Eighth Amendment violations on the \nbasis of sovereign immunity but not dismissing the named prison official). \n \n1 Four amicus briefs focusing on the effects of long-term solitary confinement were \nalso filed in support of Hope.   \n3 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 4     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nAgainst  that  backdrop,  we  first  look  to  whether  Hope  has  established \nstanding as to each of his claims. \nGenerally, a plaintiff has standing to sue under Article III if he can \nshow  (1)  an  injury-in-fact,  concrete  and particularized, that is (2) fairly \ntraceable to the defendantโs challenged action, and (3) redressable by a \nfavorable outcome. City of Austin v. Paxton, 943 F.3d 993, 1002 (5th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 1047 (2021) (citing Clapper v. Amnesty Intโl \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 411 (2013)). \nLiberally construing Hopeโs pro se complaint, as we must, Grant v. \nCuellar,  59  F.3d  523,  524  (5th  Cir.  1995),  he  alleges  three  claims.2 \nSpecifically,  Hope  alleges  a  procedural  due  process  claim  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment against all Defendants and a retaliation claim under \nthe First Amendment against Defendants Warden Harris and Major Rehse. \nHe also brings an Eighth Amendment claim against all Defendants for cruel \nand unusual punishment.  \nโAt the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting \nfrom the defendantโs conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we \nโpresum[e] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are \nnecessary to support the claim.โโ Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n(1992) (quoting Lujan v. Natโl Wildlife Fed., 497 U.S. 871, 889 (1990)) \n(alterations in original). And โwhen the suit is one challenging the legality of \ngovernment action or inaction,โ of which the prisoner is the object, then \nโthere is ordinarily little question . . . that a judgment preventing or requiring \nthe action will redress it.โ Id. at 561โ62. \n \n2 Although Hope is represented by counsel on appeal, he proceeded pro se in the \ndistrict court. \n4 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 5     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nHere, Hope has offered numerous factual allegations supporting each \nof his claims. For example, regarding Hopeโs procedural due process claim, \nHope alleges that he is denied meaningful reviews to determine if he should \nbe removed from solitary confinement and that the hearings that are held \nregarding his classification are a โsham.โ Specifically, Hope alleges that each \nof the Defendants has contributed to the denial of a meaningful review and \ndue process by, inter alia, not discussing matters related to his file and failing \nto follow the classification policies and โfair procedures.โ To that end, Hope \nhas alleged that his denial of procedural due process is fairly traceable to each \nof the Defendants, and his requested relief would redress this injury by, for \nexample, ordering Defendants to afford Hope the process he claims that he \nis due. See id.  \nAs to the retaliation claim, Hope has also alleged an injury-in-fact. \nNamely, he alleges that after filing a grievance, he suffered various retaliatory \nacts such as being moved to over 263 different cells and having his typewriter \nconfiscated. He alleges that Defendants Warden Harris and Major Rehse \nhave ordered these moves, which suffices at the pleading stage as a factual \nallegation that the injury resulted from Defendantsโ conduct. Id. at 560. And \nat this stage in the proceedings, his requested relief would redress this injury \nby,  for  example,  enjoining  the  frequent  cell  moves.  See  id  at  561โ62  \n(explaining that where a plaintiff is the โobject of the action (or forgone \naction) at issue,โ then โthere is ordinarily little question that the action or \ninaction has caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing or requiring \nthe action will redress itโ). \nFinally, as to his Eighth Amendment claim, Hope has alleged that he \nhas suffered โphysical and psychological mal[a]dies due to the inhumane \ntreatment and conditionsโ and has been denied โbasic needs.โ He goes on \nto allege that โ[e]ach of the Defendants in one capacity or another work \ntogether to ensure Mr. Hope continues to be subjected to these inhumane \n5 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 6     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nconditions and have done so for a prolonged period of time.โ As such, Hope \nhas alleged an injury-in-factโhis physical and psychological maladiesโthat \nis fairly traceable to Defendants in light of their roles in maintaining those \nconditions and Hopeโs confinement in those conditions. See id. at 560โ61. \nFinally,  Hopeโs  requested  relief  is  that  he  not  be  subjected  to  these \nโinhumane  conditions,โ  and  so,  because  Hope  is  the  object  of  the \nDefendantsโ continuation of these conditions, a judgment enjoining such \nactions would redress the alleged harm. See id. at 561โ62.  \nFor these reasons, contrary to the magistrate judgeโs conclusion, \nHope has standing to bring this action.3  \nWe  must  also  assure  ourselves  that  this  suit  clears  a  second \njurisdictional barโstate sovereign immunity. Perez v. Region 20 Educ. Serv. \nCtr., 307 F.3d 318, 333 n.8 (5th Cir. 2002) (noting that state sovereign \nimmunity  โbears  on  [the]  courtโs  subject-matter  jurisdictionโ).  State \nsovereign immunity prohibits โprivate suits against nonconsenting states in \nfederal court.โ See City of Austin, 943 F.3d at 997; see also Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 U.S. 1, 13 (1890). And where a suit is effectively against the state, the \n \n3 The magistrate judge concluded that Hope lacked standing to bring this action \nbecause his claims were not redressable by Defendants. Specifically, the magistrate judge \nfound that Hopeโs claims were not redressable because some of Defendants had left Hopeโs \nprison unit and that only the โDirectorโ of the prison system, who was not named among \nDefendants and whom the magistrate judge did not offer any details about, could redress \nHopeโs injuries. But this was an error. First, Hope brought, inter alia, official-capacity \nclaims  against  Defendants,  allowing  the  officialsโ  successors  to  be  automatically \nsubstituted, so it is of no moment that some of the Defendants have left Hopeโs unit. \nGanther v. Ingle, 75 F.3d 207, 210 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1996); see also Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2) \n(โThe public officerโs successor is automatically substituted as a party.โ). Second, the \nmagistrate judgeโs conclusion appears to rest on an assumption that the only way to redress \nHopeโs injuries was releasing him from solitary confinement. But Hopeโs requested relief \nis not so limited. Indeed, Hope also requests that he not be subjected to certain conditions \nof confinement as well as receive additional process.  \n6 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 7     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nstate officials enjoy the same sovereign immunity that would be afforded the \nstate. Tex. Democratic Party v. Abbott, 978 F.3d 168, 179 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. \ndenied, 141 S. Ct. 1124 (2021); City of Austin, 943 F.3d at 997. In the absence \nof abrogation by Congress, waiver by the state, or application of an exception, \nstate sovereign immunity bars suit. Tex. Democratic Party, 978 F.3d at 179. \nRelevant here is the exception under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 \n(1908), which permits suits for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief \nagainst a state official acting in violation of federal law if there is a sufficient \nconnection to enforcing the allegedly unconstitutional law. See id. We have \nmade clear that enforcement means โcompulsionโ or โconstraintโ and that \na plaintiff must at least show that the defendant has a particular duty to \nenforce the challenged conduct. Id.; see also Tex. Democratic Party v. Hughs, \nNo. 20-50683, 2021 WL 1826760, at *2 (5th Cir. May 7, 2021). And we note \nthat generally โall institutional litigation involving state prisons,โ such as \nthis case, is brought under the Ex parte Young exception. Brennan v. Stewart, \n834 F.2d 1248, 1252 n.6 (5th Cir. 1988). In fact, โ[t]he exception is so well \nestablished [in that context] thatโ such cases often do not even โmention[] . \n. . Ex parte Young.โ Id.; see also Kahey v. Jones, 836 F.2d 948, 949 (5th Cir. \n1988)  (โTo  the  extent  her  complaint  [against  the  Warden]  thus  seeks \nprospective injunctive relief against the state, it does not contravene the \neleventh amendment.โ). Finally, although analytically distinct questions, \nthere is โsignificant[] overlapโ between the Article III standing and the Ex \nparte Young inquiries. See City of Austin, 943 F.3d at 1002 (quoting Air Evac \nEMS, Inc. v. Tex., Depโt of Ins. Div. of Workersโ Comp., 851 F.3d 507, 520 (5th \nCir. 2017)). And we note, too, that the standing inquiry can inform the state \nsovereign immunity inquiry. See id. \nAgainst that backdrop, each of the Defendants whom Hope named \nand seeks prospective injunctive relief against has the authority to compel or \nconstrain Hopeโs conditions of confinement by maintaining those conditions \n7 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 8     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nand his placement within them.4 See, e.g., Kahey, 836 F.2d at 949 (noting that \ncomplaints against the prison warden do not contravene state sovereign \nimmunity); City of Austin, 943 F.3d at 1001 (discussing a case where board \nmembers had the requisite authority for purposes of Ex parte Young because \nthe board had the authority to decide whether to pay certain claims); see also \nMorris v. Livingston, 739 F.3d 740, 746 (5th Cir. 2014) (explaining that under \nTex. Govโt Code 501.063(b) the Texas Department of Criminal Justice \nis responsible for enforcing the challenged statutory provision). Therefore, \n \n4 First, Hope named Todd Harris, the Senior Warden, and in similar prison \nlitigation, the warden is almost invariably named as a defendant. See, e.g., Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 830 (1994) (naming the warden of the prison where the prisoner was \nhoused). And it stands to reason that the prison warden would have a sufficient connection \nto enforcing the allegedly unconstitutional prison conditions by compelling or constraining \ncertain practices. See Tex. Democratic Party, 978 F.3d at 179; see also Kahey, 836 F.2d at 949. \nSecond, Hope named Major Chad Rehse, whose duties include overseeing the conditions \nof confinement and treatment of inmates in solitary confinement. Such duties satisfy the \nrequired connection to the challenged conduct because Major Rehse can compel or \nconstrain certain challenged conditions of confinement. See City of Austin, 943 F.3d at 1001; \nsee also Southard v. Tex. Bd. of Crim. Just., 114 F.3d 539, 552 (5th Cir. 1997) (explaining that \nโ[e]ach prison unit organizes the line of authority over its security personnel after a military \nchain of command: wardens, assistant wardens, majors, captains, lieutenants, sergeants, \nand correctional officers, in descending hierarchical orderโ). The same is true of Deputy \nDirector of Support Operations Leonard Eschessa whose duties include managing the \noverall treatment, conditions of confinement, and classifications of inmates. See Tex. Depโt \nof Crim. Just. v. Terrell, 925 S.W.2d 44, 47 (Tex. App.โTyler 1995, no pet.) (describing \nthe chain of command). Assistant Director of Classifications Joni White is responsible for \nโthe overall classifications,โ again satisfying the requisite connection by being in a position \nto compel or constrain classification of prisoners. See Martinez v. Stephens, No. CV H-16-\n0195, 2017 WL 607129, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 15, 2017) (describing the Assistant Directorโs \nrole and responsibilities). Finally, when it comes to the three state classification committee \nmembers, they all have the authority to make final decisions regarding administrative \nsegregation, which yet again satisfies the requisite connection in that the committee \nmembers are in a position to compel or constrain classification of prisoners. See Wilkerson \nv. Goodwin, 774 F.3d 845, 850 (5th Cir. 2014) (analyzing a claim where a prisoner in solitary \nconfinement sued various prison officials, including two classification officers). \n8 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nstate sovereign immunity does not bar Hopeโs official-capacity claims for \nprospective injunctive relief.  \nBut, as the magistrate judge correctly recognized, Hope cannot seek \nmonetary  damages  from  Defendants  in  their  official  capacities.  Tex. \nDemocratic Party, 978 F.3d at 179; see also Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30 \n(1991). The same is not necessarily so, however, for Hopeโs individual-\ncapacity claims, and we turn to these next. \nB.  Hopeโs  individual-capacity  claims  must  be  considered  in  the  first \ninstance. \nIn addition to his official-capacity claims, Hope also sought damages \nagainst Defendants in their individual capacities, which is permitted. See \nHafer, 502 U.S. at 30โ31. Here, however, neither the magistrate judge nor \nthe district court ever considered these individual-capacity claims before \ndismissing the entire complaint with prejudice. But as โwe are a court of \nreview, not of first view,โ we do not pass on the individual-capacity claims \nand instead remand to the district court to consider these claims in the first \ninstance. Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005); In re Ultra \nPetroleum Corp., 943 F.3d 758, 766 (5th Cir. 2019). \nIII. \nWe review the district courtโs ruling on a motion to dismiss under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo. Wampler v. Sw. Bell Tel. \nCo., 597 F.3d 741, 744 (5th Cir. 2010). โTo survive a motion to dismiss, a \ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to โstate a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.โโ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A \nclaim is plausible โwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.โ Id. In exercising this review, we will not dismiss a claim \n9 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 10     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nโunless the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim that \nwould entitle him to relief.โ Alexander v. Verizon Wireless Servs., L.L.C., 875 \nF.3d 243, 249 (5th Cir. 2017). โWe take all factual allegations as true and \nconstrue the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.โ Id. Further, \nwhere, as here, the complaint was filed pro se, we liberally construe it. Grant, \n59 F.3d at 524. \nA. Hope has failed to state a procedural due process claim. \nWe turn first to Hopeโs procedural due process claim. And on this \nclaim, we generally agree with the district court. To determine what process \nis due, we address two inquiries: โ(1) whether there exists a liberty . . . \ninterest which has been interfered with by the State and (2) whether the \nprocedures  attendant  upon  that  deprivation  were  constitutionally \nsufficient.โ Richardson v. Tex. Secโy of State, 978 F.3d 220, 228โ29 (5th Cir. \n2020) (citation omitted). \nAs to the first inquiry, Hope likely has established a liberty interest. \nThat is, he has been placed in solitary confinement indefinitely, and his \nplacement renders him ineligible for parole. Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. \n209, 224โ25 (2005); see also Wilkerson, 774 F.3d at 855. \nTurning to the second inquiry, to determine what process is due, we \nlook to the framework established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), \nwhich โrequires consideration of three distinct factors,โ namely (1) โthe \nprivate interest that will be affected by the official action,โ (2) โthe risk of an \nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \nprobable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards,โ and \n(3) โthe Governmentโs interest, including the function involved and the \nfiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural \nrequirement would entail.โ Austin, 545 U.S. at 224-25 (quoting Eldridge, 424 \nU.S. at 335).  \n10 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 11     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nIn this case, although Hopeโs interest is โmore than minimal,โ it \nโmust be evaluated . . . within the context of the prison system and its \nattendant curtailment of liberties.โ Id. at 225. Put differently, we look to how \nmuch liberty Hope is deprived of over and above what would normally be \nincident to prison life. And so, Hopeโs interest is low. \nFrom  there,  we  turn  to  the  risk  of  erroneous  deprivation  by \nconsidering  whether  Hope  has  โnotice  of  the  factual  basis  leading  to \nconsideration for [solitary] placementโ and โa fair opportunity for rebuttal.โ \nId. at 225โ26. Where the government gives a prisoner an opportunity โto \nsubmit objections prior to the final level of review,โ that decreases the \nlikelihood of erroneous deprivation. Id. at 226. \nHere, Hope has received notice of the factual basis for his placement \nin solitaryโhis escape record. To be sure, Hope claims that his designation \nas an โescape riskโ has been removed. But in any event, Hope concedes that \nthe basis for his present placement in solitary remains โan incident that will \nnever change from over 23 years ago.โ In so doing, Hope has alleged that he \nhas notice. \nWe also find that based on the allegations before us, even viewing \nthem in the light most favorable to Hope, Hope has had a fair opportunity for \nrebuttal. Indeed, according to Hope he has attended at least forty-eight \nhearings and has made statements during those hearings. In other words, \nHope has been allowed to levy โobjections prior to the final level of review,โ \nthereby decreasing the likelihood of erroneous deprivation. Id. \nFinally,  turning  to  the  governmentโs  interest,  Texasโs  โfirst \nobligation must be to ensure the safety of . . . the public.โ Id. at 227. \nMoreover, given the scarce resources of prison systems, we must โgive \nsubstantial  deference  to  prison  management  decisions  before  mandating \nadditional expenditures for elaborate procedural safeguards.โ Id. at 228. \n11 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 12     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nBased on the pleadings before us, Texasโs interest in keeping the public safe \nfrom Hope, who has previously escaped, weighs in favor of finding that Hope \nhas been given adequate process. \nPut simply, even accepting Hopeโs allegations as true and viewing \nthem in the light most favorable to him, the governmentโs interest outweighs \nHopeโs  interest,  and  the  process  he  is  given  suffices  to  satisfy  the \nconstitutional requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, we \naffirm the district courtโs dismissal of this claim. \nB. Hope has stated a claim for retaliation. \nHope also alleges that Defendants Warden Harris and Major Rehse \nhave engaged in various forms of retaliatory conduct against him as a result \nof his filing grievances and having outside advocates contact officials โabout \nhis continued confinement in solitary.โ  \n โTo prevail on a claim of retaliation, a prisoner must establish (1) a \nspecific constitutional right, (2) the defendantโs intent to retaliate against the \nprisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and \n(4) causation.โ Morris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2006) (citation \nomitted).  โAn  action  motivated  by  retaliation  for  the  exercise  of  a \nconstitutionally protected right is actionable, even if the act, when taken for \na different reason, might have been legitimate.โ Woods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, \n1165 (5th Cir. 1995). \nTo show causation as part of his retaliation claim, in violation of his \nFirst Amendment rights, โa plaintiff must allege that, but for the retaliatory \nmotive, the complained of incident would not have occurred.โ Gonzales v. \nGross,  779  F.  Appโx  227,  230  (5th  Cir.  2019)  (citation  and  alterations \nomitted). That is, a prisoner must either (1) โproduce direct evidence of \nmotivationโ or (2) โallege a chronology of events from which retaliation may \nplausibly be inferred.โ Id. (citation omitted).  \n12 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 13     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nIn his pleadings, Hope alleges a constitutional right under the First \nAmendment to file a grievance with the prison system and that after filing \nsuch a grievance (and after outside advocates contacted the prison on his \nbehalf), his typewriter was confiscated and then, between 2012 and 2018, he \nwas moved a total of 263 times.  \nHope alleges that before he filed his grievance, for almost fourteen \nyears, he remained in the same cell or was moved only infrequently. In other \nwords, the alleged cell-move policy and the confiscation of his typewriter \n(which  he  used  to  type  the  grievance)  only  occurred  after  he  filed  the \ngrievance. Such a drastic shift has been alleged with sufficient detail so as to \nconstitute a โchronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be \ninferred.โ Woods, 60 F.3d at 1166 (quoting Cain v. Lane, 857 F.2d 1139, 1143 \nn.6 (7th Cir. 1988)). Plainly, Hope alleges that the retaliatory or adverse act \nis the excessive number of moves from cell to cellโa policy and practice he \nalleges is still in effectโand confiscation of his typewriter. Cf. Petzold v. \nRostollan, 946 F.3d 242, 253โ54 (5th Cir. 2019) (finding that an inference of \nretaliation was bolstered by the chronology of events).  Accordingly, Hope \nhas plausibly alleged a retaliation claim as to these incidents. \nSecond, Hope alleges that after requesting video footage of a search of \nhis cell, he was exposed to pepper spray and โleft nude in a cell [for eight \ndays] with the pepper spray still on his body and nothing to clean it off with.โ \nBut, as alleged, the constitutional violation at issue is not clear, and we do not \nfind that Hope has alleged a retaliation claim based on this incident.  \nAt  bottom,  Hope  has  plausibly  alleged  all  three  elements  of  a \nretaliation claim against Defendants Harris and Rehse as to the cell-move \npolicy  and  typewriter  confiscation,  and  we  vacate  the  district  courtโs \ndismissal of Hopeโs retaliation claim and remand for further proceedings. \n13 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 14     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nC. Hope has stated a claim for a violation of the Eighth Amendment based \non certain conditions of his confinement only against Major Rehse.5 \nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of โcruel and unusual \npunishments.โ  U.S.  Const.  amend.  VIII.  But  long-term  solitary \nconfinement is not per se cruel and unusual. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, \n686 (1978) (observing that it is โperfectly obvious that every decision to \nremove  a  particular  inmate  from  the  general  prison  population  for  an \nindeterminate period could not be characterized as cruel and unusualโ). \nNevertheless,  โ[t]here  is  a  line  where  solitary  confinement  conditions \nbecome so severe that its use is converted from a viable prisoner disciplinary \ntool to cruel and unusual punishment.โ Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1304 \n(5th Cir. 1974). With that in mind, we focus our analysis of Hopeโs Eighth \nAmendment claim on whether the conditions of Hopeโs confinement are \nsufficiently โsevere.โ See id.; Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834. \nOf course, the Constitution does not require โcomfortableโ prison \nconditions, but the conditions of confinement may not โinvolve the wanton \nand unnecessary infliction of pain.โ Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, \n349  (1981);  see  also  Daigre,  719  F.2d  at  1312  (noting  that  โthe  eighth \n \n5 To the extent that Hope has also alleged Eighth Amendment violations for other \naspects of his confinement such as his lack of the same type of access to the law library as \nprisoners in the general population, the type of condiments he receives with his meals, or \nthe type of human contact he has as compared to prisoners in the general population, such \nclaims fail as a matter of law. See Daigre v. Maggio, 719 F.2d 1310, 1312 (5th Cir. 1983) \n(explaining that โisolation is punitive . . . and that deprivations beyond those imposed on \nthe general prison population is the very essence of internal prison disciplineโ). Similarly, \nto the extent that Hope has alleged an Eighth Amendment violation based on the sheer \nlength of his confinement, this claim also fails. As the Supreme Court has explained, โthe \nlength of isolation sentences was not considered in a vacuum.โ Hutto, 437 U.S. at 685; see \nalso Grabowski v. Lucas, No. 94-60177, 1994 WL 652674, at *3 (5th Cir. Nov. 11, 1994) (per \ncuriam). \n14 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 15     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \namendment forbids deprivation of the basic elements of hygieneโ) (citing \nNovak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661, 665 (5th Cir. 1971)).  \nTo state a claim for a violation of the Eighth Amendment based on \nconditions  of  confinement,  a  prisoner  must  allege  (1)  that  the  prison \nconditions pose a โsufficiently seriousโ threat to his health, including his \nmental  health,  and  (2)  that  prison  officials  acted  with  โdeliberate \nindifferenceโ to such threat. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834 (quoting Wilson v. \nSeiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298, 302 (1991)). \nTo  meet  the  first  requirement,  the  prisoner  must  show  that  the \nconditions, either alone or in combination, constitute an โunquestioned and \nserious deprivationโ of his โbasic human needsโ such as food, clothing, \nmedical care, and safe and sanitary living conditions. See Chapman, 452 U.S. \nat 347โ48; cf. Daigre, 719 F.2d at 1312 (rejecting an Eighth Amendment \nchallenge where the record did not establish that the prisonerโs โisolation \ncell is generally unsanitaryโ but noting that a โdeprivation of the basic \nelements of hygieneโ is forbidden). And, conditions of confinement may be \naggregated to rise to the level of a constitutional violation โwhen they have a \nmutually  enforcing  effect  that  produces  the  deprivation  of  a  single, \nidentifiable human need such as food, warmth, or exercise.โ Wilson, 501 U.S. \nat 304 (explaining that there may be an Eighth Amendment violation where \na prisoner complained of a โlow cell temperature at night combined with a \nfailure to issue blanketsโ). Further, under the Eighth Amendment, โthe \nlength  of  confinement  cannot  be  ignored  in  deciding  whether  the \nconfinement meets constitutional standards.โ Finney, 437 U.S. at 686. \nAs  to  the  second  requirement,  the  prisoner  must  show  that  the \ndefendant acted with โmore than mere negligence.โ Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835. \nTo that end, the prisoner must show that those prison officials were (1) \nโaware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial \n15 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 16     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nrisk of serious harm existsโ; (2) โsubjectively drew the inference that the risk \nexistedโ; and (3) โdisregarded the risk.โ Cleveland v. Bell, 938 F.3d 672, 676 \n(5th Cir. 2019) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837) (alterations omitted). More \nsimply, the prison officials must know of, and disregard, an excessive risk to \na prisonerโs health or safety. See id. (citation omitted). Evidence that a risk \nwas obvious or otherwise apparent may be sufficient to support an inference \nthat the prison official was aware of the risk. Estate of Cheney ex rel. Cheney v. \nCollier, 560 F. Appโx 271, 273โ74 (2014) (collecting cases); see also Valentine \nv. Collier, 978 F.3d 154, 163 (5th Cir. 2020) (citing Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. \n730, 738 (2002)). \nAnd it is on this second requirement, deliberate indifference, where \nmuch of Hopeโs Eighth Amendment challenge falls short. Specifically, Hope \nhas  not  sufficiently  pleaded  deliberate  indifferenceโwith  one  exception \ndiscussed supraโbecause it is unclear from Hopeโs complaint if any of \nDefendants, with the exception of Major Rehse, was even aware of the \nconditions of which he complains. In the absence of such allegations of \ndeliberate  indifferenceโregardless  of  whether  any  of  the  complained-of \nconditions indeed invoke Eighth Amendment concernsโHope has failed to \nstate a claim. Cleveland, 938 F.3d at 676. Therefore, we affirm the district \ncourtโs dismissal of Hopeโs Eighth Amendment claim as to all Defendants \nexcept Major Rehse. \nThat said, liberally construing Hopeโs complaint as we must, Hope \nhas plausibly alleged that Major Rehse was deliberately indifferent to certain \nconditions of confinement, which he alleges deprived him of basic human \nneeds such as sanitary living conditions.  \nFirst, Hope has alleged that for over two decades he has been in \nsolitary confinement in sometimes unsanitary conditions, including urine, \nfeces,  and  mold  on  the  walls,  floor,  and  showers,  insufficient  cleaning \n16 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 17     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nsupplies,  and  exposure  to  pepper  spray  and  tear  gas  without \ndecontamination.6  \nWe have previously found that similar unsanitary conditions in a \nprison cell can, in certain circumstances, rise to the level of cruel and unusual \npunishment. See Taylor v. Stevens, 946 F.3d 211, 219โ20 (5th Cir. 2019), cert. \ngranted, judgment vacated on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v. Riojas, 141 S. Ct. \n52 (2020); Gates, 501 F.2d at 1302; Fussell v. Vannoy, 584 F. Appโx 270, 271 \n(5th Cir. 2014); Smith v. Leonard, 244 F. Appโx 583, 584 (5th Cir. 2007). \nHere,  among  other  allegations,  Hope  alleges  that  a  wall  was  almost \ncompletely covered in black mold. According to Hope, he was in the mold-\ninfested cell for two weeks and began coughing and was never given cleaning \nsupplies to address the condition. This likely is sufficiently serious by itself. \nSee, e.g., Smith, 244 F. Appโx at 584 (vacating the judgment and remanding \nan Eighth Amendment claim regarding a prison officialโs failure to remove \nโallegedly toxic moldโ from prison); cf. Taylor, 946 F.3d at 219 (citation \nomitted) (observing that a cell โcovered with crusted fecal matter, urine, \n \n6 Although Hope also challenges the types of meals he receives, including that some \nhave made him sick, such challenges fail as a matter of law. See Martin v. Scott, 156 F.3d \n578, 580 (5th Cir. 1998) (finding that allegations that a prisoner โbecame ill after being fed \nVita-Proโa soy-based meat substituteโsimply do not rise to the level of cruel and unusual \npunishmentโ). Hopeโs allegations regarding the policy that he be handcuffed from behind \nand forced to squat down suffer a similar fate. See Talib v. Gilley, 138 F.3d 211, 215 (5th Cir. \n1998) (finding that โa policy requiring prisoners on lockdown to kneel facing the wall with \ntheir hands behind their backs when served mealsโ did not constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment). Similarly, although Hope also generally alleges excessive noise and sleep \ndeprivation, on the face of Hopeโs complaint, it is not clear if the alleged noise is serious \nenough to cause sleep deprivation or how much sleep Hope actually gets. Without such \nallegations, Hope has not alleged that he โhas been deprived of the minimal measure of \nlifeโs necessities.โ See Chavarria v. Stacks, 102 F. Appโx 433, 436 n.2 (5th Cir. 2004). \nFinally, to the extent that Hope alleged an Eighth Amendment claim for a denial of \npsychiatric treatment, such a claim was not sufficiently briefed on appeal and is thus \nwaived. See FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(9)(A); United States v. Martinez, 263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th \nCir. 2001). \n17 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 18     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \ndried ejaculate, peeling and chipping paint, and old food particlesโ violated \nthe Eighth Amendment). But taken together with the urine and feces on the \nwall, which Hope alleges has occurred โmany timesโ throughout his twenty-\nsix years in these conditions, it is more than plausible that Hopeโs decades of \nsolitary confinement alongside such conditions of mold, urine, and feces have \ncaused the physical and psychological deterioration he alleges, and it is clear \nthat such an allegation is sufficiently serious to invoke Eighth Amendment \nconcerns. See Taylor, 946 F.3d at 219; Fussell, 584 F. Appโx at 271; Smith, \n244 F. Appโx at 584. \nAdditionally, we have previously found that ordering a prisoner back \ninto  a  tear-gas-filled  cell  without  supplies for decontamination could be \nsufficiently serious. Cardona v. Taylor, 828 F. Appโx 198, 202 (5th Cir. 2020). \nHere, Hope has alleged that he has been exposed to pepper spray and tear gas \nin his cell โat least ten times through no fault of his own,โ that the cell was \nnot decontaminated, and that on one occasion he was โleft nude in a cell with \nthe pepper spray still on his body [without anything] to clean it off withโ for \neight days. To the extent that Hope complains that he has suffered physical \nharm  as  a  result  of  being  exposed  to  such  chemicals  โunnecessarily \ndispensedโ by Major Rehse, he has plausibly alleged a sufficiently serious \ncondition. See Knighten v. John, No. 98-40644, 1999 WL 301376, at *2 (5th \nCir. Apr. 29, 1999). Taking these allegations as true, these conditions are \nlikewise sufficiently serious at this stage of the litigation.  \nSecond, liberally construed, Hopeโs complaint adequately alleges that \nMajor Rehse knew of and disregarded the excessive risks to Hopeโs health \nand safety due to these allegedly unsanitary conditions. Specifically, Hope \nalleges that โMajor Rehse continue[s] to subject [him] to . . . unsanitary . . . \nliving conditions,โ even though he is responsible for placing prisoners in \nโsanitaryโ cells. He further alleges that Major Rehse has instructed other \n18 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 19     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nofficers not to turn on the exhaust fans to clear the pepper spray and tear gas \nand is โresponsible for the frequent moves and placing [him] into these \nunsanitary cells.โ Hope also goes on to allege that Major Rehse โpersonally \nsaw the black moldโ on the cell wall. And these allegations are made against \nthe  backdrop  of  Hopeโs  allegation  that  he  is  no  longer  an  escape  risk. \nAccepting the allegations in Hopeโs complaint as true, it is at least plausible \nthat Hopeโs continued confinement in these conditions is not a matter of \nreasonable policy judgment but is instead deliberate indifference. See Fussell, \n584 F. Appโx at 271โ72; see also Hope, 536 U.S. at 738. \nIn any event, by alleging that Major Rehse knew of the unsanitary \nconditions and chemical agents, which have an obvious risk of harm, Hope \nhas  sufficiently  pleaded  deliberate  indifference  as  to  those  unsanitary \nconditions  and  the  chemical  agents  to  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss.  Cf. \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 848 (analyzing a prisonerโs ability to prove facts such as \nsubjective intent at summary judgment after the development of the factual \nrecord). Therefore, we vacate the district courtโs dismissal of Hopeโs Eighth \nAmendment claims against Major Rehse and remand for further proceedings. \nAt bottom, Hope has not had any opportunity to take discovery or \ndevelop the record. Whether or not the factual record, when developed more \nfully, will ultimately show that the Eighth Amendment was violated, the facts \nasserted in his pro se complaint plausibly allege as much as to Major Rehse.  \nIV. \nFor the foregoing reasons, regarding Hopeโs official-capacity claims, \nwe AFFIRM the dismissal of Hopeโs procedural due process claim under \nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Next,  we  VACATE  the  judgment  as  to \nHopeโs  retaliation  claim  under  the  First  Amendment  as  to  Defendants \nWarden Harris and Major Rehse and REMAND for further proceedings \nconsistent with this opinion. Similarly, we VACATE the judgment as to \n19 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 20     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \nHopeโs Eighth Amendment claim only as to Defendant Major Rehse and \nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. But we \nAFFIRM the dismissal of Hopeโs Eighth Amendment claim as to all other \nDefendants. \n Finally, the district court is DIRECTED to consider in the first \ninstance Hopeโs individual-capacity claims.\n20 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 21     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \n \nHaynes, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: \nI concur with much of the majority opinion, but I respectfully dissent \nin  part  as  indicated  here.1    While  I  agree  that  there  is  subject  matter \njurisdiction for the official capacity claims (limited, as stated, to prospective \ninjunctive relief), I respectfully dissent from the majority opinionโs treatment \nof Hopeโs official capacity Eighth Amendment and due process claims2โI \nconclude that Hopeโs factual allegations are sufficient to state such claims \nagainst all Defendants in their official capacity.   \nAs to the Eighth Amendment claims, the majority opinion concludes \nthat Hope can proceed only against Rehse, and only in connection with \ncertain conditions of his confinement.  To be sure, the grossly unsanitary \nconditions of Hopeโs confinement clearly support an Eighth Amendment \nclaim.    But  the  majority  opinion  fails  to  meaningfully  address  how  the \nextraordinary length of Hopeโs confinement affects Hopeโs other Eighth \nAmendment claims, failing to recognize that other Defendants were plausibly \ndeliberately indifferent to Hopeโs suffering on multiple fronts. \nIn  particular,  the  extreme  length  of  Hopeโs  solitary  confinement \nshould make it easier for him to prove an Eighth Amendment violation, or (at \nthe very least) require additional justification from the State to avoid liability.  \n \n1 In addition to the discussion above, I agree with the majority opinion that Hope \nhas stated a claim for retaliation against Defendants Harris and Rehse, but I respectfully \ndissent from the portion of the majority opinion that narrows the scope of Hopeโs \nretaliation claim to just the seizure of Hopeโs typewriter.  Most significantly, the majority \nopinion disregards a key part of the retaliatory incidentโnamely, Hope being pepper \nsprayed and then left nude in a cell for eight days (all the while covered in the spray). \nHopeโs complaint makes clear that the pepper spray incident was part of the retaliation he \nexperienced  for filing a grievance; it naturally flowed fromโindeed, happened only \nminutes afterโthe typewriter seizure.  The underlying constitutional violation is therefore \nthe same: retaliation in violation of the First Amendment.  I would include those aspects in \nthe remand.   \n2 I agree with the remand of the individual claims. \n21 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 22     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \n \nSee Taylor v. Riojas, 141 S. Ct. 52, 52โ54 (2020) (per curiam) (concluding that \nonly six days of confinement in โdeplorably unsanitary conditionsโ was an \nobvious  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment).3    That  is  so  because  the \nextreme length affects both prongs of the Eighth Amendment analysis.  As to \nthe first prongโrequiring a โsufficiently seriousโ deprivationโthe duration \nof his solitary confinement acts as a significant aggravating factor, increasing \nthe severity of the deprivation.  See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304 (1991) \n(acknowledging that โ[s]ome conditions of confinement may establish an \nEighth Amendment violation โin combinationโ when each would not do so \naloneโ (emphasis omitted)); see also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 685โ87 \n(1978)  (explaining  how  the  length  of  confinement  interacts  with  the \nconditions of confinement).  As to the second prongโdemonstrating that a \nprison official acted with โdeliberate indifferenceโโthe duration of his \nsolitary confinement makes it more likely that all of the Defendants were \naware of a constitutional deprivation and disregarded the risk.  Simply put, it \nis harder for all Defendants to contend that they lacked awareness of Hopeโs \nconditions  over  the  course  of  twenty-six  years,  especially  given  Hopeโs \nnumerous complaints and the fact that he was a โhigh profileโ inmate.  I \nconclude Hope should not be limited to pursuing such claims against only \nRehse. \nThe majority opinion also minimizes the full picture of Hopeโs Eighth \nAmendment  claims,  narrowing  them  to  just  his  complaints  about  the \nunsanitary  conditions  he  experienced.    In  so  doing,  it  largely  overlooks \nHopeโs Eighth Amendment mental health claim, maintaining that he did not \n \n3 The Taylor decision illustrates how extreme conditions can give rise to an Eighth \nAmendment claim for even a short durational period.  141 S. Ct. at 52โ54.  The calculus \nobviously runs in the other direction, as wellโan extremely long duration may reduce the \nneed to demonstrate harsher conditions.  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686โ87 (1978) \n(observing that โ[a] filthy, overcrowded cell and a diet of โgrueโ might be tolerable for a \nfew days and intolerably cruel for weeks or monthsโ). \n22 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 23     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \n \nsufficiently brief it on appeal.  That is incorrectโHope has argued, in both \nhis amended complaint and in his briefing on appeal, that he suffers from \nโanxiety, depression, visual and auditory hallucinationsโ and has โthoughts \nof suicide.โ  Moreover, he has repeatedly contended that the Defendants are \naware of these conditions because Hope โhas told them of his symptoms and \nbecause the harms of long-term solitary confinement are widely known.โ  \nThese allegations are sufficient to support an Eighth Amendment claim \nbased on Hopeโs mental health. \nAt  the  very  least,  Hope  stated  such  a  claim  against  Joni  White, \nAssistant Director of Classifications.  According to Hopeโs complaint, White \nโwas contacted by outside advocates after years of Mr. Hope sending her \nletters asking questions about his continued isolationโ (demonstrating her \nawareness of Hopeโs prolonged isolation).  White knew of โthe effect that \nlong-term isolation takes on the brainโ due to her training (demonstrating \nher knowledge of the risk of long-term confinement).  Yet she maintained \nthat she would neither allow for nor recommend Hopeโs release from solitary \nconfinement (demonstrating that she disregarded this risk), all because of his \n1994 escape.  Such actions suggest deliberate indifference; Hope should be \nallowed to pursue claims against such alleged conduct. \nAs for Hopeโs due process claim, the majority opinion errs on virtually \nevery step of the Mathews v. Eldridge analysis.  As to the first prongโthe \nprivate interest affected by the official actionโthe majority opinion issues \nthe conclusory statement that Hopeโs liberty interest is โlowโ; it seemingly \nassumes that his liberty would be curtailed even in better prison conditions \ntherefore Hopeโs deprivation is not over and above what would normally be \nincident to prison life.  However, even a prisoner can assert such a claim: \nHope contends that he has been deprived of a whole host of opportunities \npreviously available to him in the general population, including the ability to \nsocialize, to attend religious services, to receive educational programming, \n23 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 24     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \n \nand to work.4   For over two decades, the beginning, middle, and end of every \nday of Hopeโs life has taken place in a single cell โno larger than a parking \nspace.โ5  For the majority opinion to sayโwithout citation or analysis, no \nlessโthat  the  extremely  restrictive  conditions  of  Hopeโs  confinement \nmerely implicate a โlowโ liberty interest thus overlooks the crux of his \nallegations.   \nAs to the second prongโthe risk of an erroneous deprivationโthe \nmajority opinion is correct that Hope had notice of the โfactual basisโ \nleading to his solitary confinement, but wrong to conclude that he clearly had \nโa fair opportunity for rebuttal.โ  Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 225โ26 \n(2005).  In particular, if Hope is correct that the forty-eight SCC hearings \nwere a โsham,โ then it would be as if he never attended any hearings at all.  \nAt this stage of litigation, his allegations plausibly support the conclusion that \nthese proceedings were not, in fact, fair, and so it is plausible that he has been \nerroneously deprived of his liberty interests.   \nFinally,  as  to  the  third  prongโthe  Stateโs  interestโI  strongly \ndisagree with the majority opinionโs suggestion that the State retains any \nmeaningful interest in continuing to isolate Hope in solitary confinement.  To \nbe sure, there is little doubt that the State had a strong interest in keeping the \npublic safe a few decades ago when Hope was first sent to solitary following \n \n4 Specifically, Hope identifies that: \nPrior to placement in solitary, he could see visitors face-to-face, attend \nreligious  services,  participate  in  group  vocational  and  educational \nprogramming, hold a job, socialize with other prisoners, and spend hours \nof his day outside his cell; now, he is confined to a 9โx6โ cell for between \n22 and 24 hours per day, allowed out only to exercise in a different \nenclosure. \nIn addition, Hope alleges that he has had only โone personal phone call since 1994โ \nand is stripped searched, on average, four times a day.  In short, he plainly faces far more \nsignificant impositions on his liberty than he faced in normal prison life.   \n5 Hope specifically alleges that he spends 23 to 24 hours a day in this cell.   \n24 \n\nCase: 20-40379      Document: 00515905537     Page: 25     Date Filed: 06/18/2021\nNo. 20-40379 \n \nhis 1994 escape, but that justification expired over fifteen years ago when the \nโescape riskโ designator was removed from his file (again, at this procedural \nstage, his factual allegations must be accepted as true).  That is a concession \nthat  the  State  no  longer  has  any  interest  in  keeping  Hope  in  solitary \nconfinement.  To say otherwise, as the majority opinion does, effectively bars \nvalid due process claims based solely on an initial justification without giving \nany consideration as to how that justification has diminishedโor, as here, \ncompletely evaporatedโover time.6 \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  would  reverse  the  district  courtโs \ndismissal of Hopeโs Eighth Amendment claims with respect to his unsanitary \nconditions of confinement and his mental health against all Defendants, as \nwell as the district courtโs dismissal of his procedural due process claim (and \nexpand the retaliation claims as to Harris and Rehse).  Because the majority \nopinion fails to do so, I respectfully dissent.   \n \n \n6 Moreover, I conclude that the Stateโs continued reliance on Hopeโs escapeโ\nover two decades agoโto justify keeping him in solitary confinement constitutes โgrossly \ndisproportionateโ punishment, subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny.  See Hutto, 437 \nU.S. at 685 (acknowledging that โ[c]onfinement in a prison or in an isolation cell is a form \nof  punishment  subject  to  scrutiny  under  Eighth  Amendment  standardsโ);  see  also \nMontgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U.S. 190, 206 (2016) (acknowledging that โ[p]rotection \nagainst disproportionate punishment is the central substantive guarantee of the Eighth \nAmendment and goes far beyond the manner of determining a defendantโs sentenceโ); \nRhodes  v.  Chapman,  452  U.S.  337,  347  (1981)  (acknowledging  that  conditions  of \nconfinement must not be โgrossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting \nimprisonmentโ).   \n25 ",

Polunsky Unit (โPolunskyโ) \nwhile Mr. Hope was housed there (โPolunsky Defendantsโ); (2) Defendants Leonard Echessa, Joni \nWhite, Kelly Enloe, Melissa Bennett, and Bonnie Fiveash, each part of the State Classification \nCommittee or classification review process (โClassification Defendantsโ); and (3) Defendants \nSimmons and Clark, both staff involved in the response to a medical incident that occurred while \nMr. Hope was at the O.B. Ellis Unit (โEllisโ and the โEllis Defendantsโ); each in their personal \ncapacity, and alleges as follows:\nINTRODUCTION \n1. For 27 years, Plaintiff Dennis Wayne Hope was confined in isolation for nearly \nevery hour of every day, often in inhumane and unsanitary conditions.  Prisoners housed in solitary \nconfinement1 face unique hardships within the prison system: they are cut off from the outside \nworld and kept in a small cell with little chance to feel or see sunlight, and without contact visits \nor phone calls with family or friends.  Those in solitary are cut off from the world within the prison \ntoo as they complete all daily activities, such as eating meals, by themselves and spend every hour \nof every day alone, with no chance to interact with a cell mate or other prisoners or participate in \nprison programming.\n2. The debilitating effects of solitary confinement, as compared to confinement in \nless-restrictive  settings,  are  well-established  and  widely  recognized  by  academics,  prison \nadministrators, and courts alike.  In fact, these effects are so well known that Justice Kennedy \n1 The terms โsolitary,โ โsolitary confinement,โ โsegregation,โ and โadministrative segregationโ (or \nโAd. Seg.โ or โSeg.โ) are used interchangeably throughout this Second Amended Complaint.\n1\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 9 of 80 PageID #: \n621\nconcluded that โ[y]ears on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.โ  Davis v. Ayala, 576 \nU.S. 257, 289 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Those researching the โterrible priceโ of \nsegregation have found the effects to be long lasting, with many prisoners experiencing post-\nrelease effects such as SHU Post-Release Syndrome2 and an increased risk of death.3  The United \nNations suggests solitary should be limited to no more than 15 days because longer segregation \nlikely amounts to torture.4  \n3. In  the  United  States,  anyone  housed  in  segregation  must  have  meaningful \nopportunities to have their placement reviewed.  See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 476, 477 n.9, \nabrogated on other grounds by Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995).  In light of this requirement, \nthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice (โTDCJโ) tasks the State Classification Committee \n(โSCCโ) with reviewing the classification of anyone in segregation at a โreview hearingโ every six \nmonths to determine whether to release such person back into general population (โG.P.โ).\n4. For 27 years, Mr. Hope endured the effects of segregation.  On top of the already-\ndevastating  effects  of  segregation,  however,  Mr.  Hope  suffered  the  additional  trauma  of \nmeaningless review hearings, of being told he would be released from solitary only to have that \ndecision overturned without warning, of being targeted by the system tasked with his safety for \ndaring to question how he could be released, and of being housed in moldy cells with other peopleโs \nfeces.\n2 Terry A.

Twelve years after Mr. Hope was placed in solitary confinement, the SCCโthe \nCommittee purportedly with the power and responsibility for reviewing housing classificationsโ\nfound that there was no justification for his continued segregation based on Mr. Hopeโs good \nbehavior, the fact that he was no longer designated as an escape risk, and the passage of so much \ntime.  Thus in 2007, the SCC decided to release Mr. Hope back to G.P.  However, a high-ranking \nTDCJ official, Robert Treon, who was still embarrassed by Mr. Hopeโs 1994 escape from a unit \nwhere Mr. Treon had been warden at the time, did not want Mr. Hope released to G.P.  Mr. Treon \nintervened to keep Mr. Hope in solitary, and Mr. Treon and a long-time colleague, Vanessa Jones, \nwho was then with the SCC, arranged to keep Mr. Hope in segregation for the foreseeable future.\n6. Three years later in 2010, after Mr. Treon had retired, SCC member Steven Rogers \nagain found there was no security need to keep Mr. Hope in solitary and again decided to release \nhim to G.P.  Like before, Ms. Jones inserted herself into the process, and the decision to release \nMr. Hope to G.P. was mysteriously overruled.  Concerned that the SCCโs decisions had been \noverruled twice, and unsure what grounds were being used to keep him in solitary or what he must \ndo to be released from segregation, Mr. Hope engaged in a number of protected First Amendment \nactivities, including filing grievances and writing letters to anyone he thought might be able to \nhelp or shine a light on his mistreatment.  Mr. Hope contacted SCC members such as Ms. Jones, \nClassification Defendants Echessa, White, and Enloe, other TDCJ officials, state legislators, and \nsometimes members of the media.  He asked outside advocates to do the same on his behalf.\n7. The  Classification  Defendants,  particularly  Ms.  White,  became  angered  with \nMr. Hope for persistently questioning how the SCC decisions to release him from solitary had \nbeen overturned outside of the available appeals process and who had authority to release him.  In \n3\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 11 of 80 PageID #:\n623\nresponse, the Classification Defendants hatched a plan to punish Mr. Hope for his advocacy by \nextending his time in solitary indefinitely, or at least until they changed their minds.\n8. The Classification Defendants unlawfully and perfunctorily denied Mr. Hopeโs \nrelease from solitary into G.P., both directly when Classification Defendants Enloe, Bennett, and \nFiveash were present at Mr. Hopeโs SCC review hearings, and when Classification Defendants \nWhite,  Enloe,  and  Bennett  directed  their  subordinates  to  deny  Mr.  Hopeโs  release  to  G.P. \nregardless of whether Mr. Hope posed a security risk necessitating such placement.  The structure \nand substance of these โhearingsโ broke with TDCJโs own policy and revealed the periodic review \nhearings to be nothing more than sham proceedings that frequently lasted no more than a few \nminutes.  In reality, the Classification Defendants had no intention of releasing Mr. Hope from \nsolitary confinement and the only purpose of the review hearings was to tell Mr. Hope he would \nremain segregated, frequently without stating any reason for the decisionโa fact SCC member \nTrevino admitted to Mr. Hope years later when he revealed Mr. Hopeโs review hearings were mere \nโwelfare checksโ and not intended to evaluate his classification.\n9. Again breaking with policy, the Classification Defendants disclaimed authority to \ntransfer Mr. Hope to G.P, each pointing their finger in a different direction but providing no \nexplanation for the inconsistency.  At various times, SCC members indicated to Mr. Hope that \nthey thought he should return to G.P. but claimed that either (1) their judgment was overridden \noutside of the SCC review hearing or (2) there was nothing they could do to put their judgment \ninto action.  Mr. Hope did not receive notice of the basis for these out-of-hearing reversals and had \nno meaningful opportunity to appeal or contest them.\n10. These improper review hearings led Mr. Hope to file grievances and contact \nofficials to question the review process.  Over time, Mr. Hope and his advocates challenged the \n4\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 12 of 80 PageID #:\n624\nlegitimacy of his review hearings with increasing frequency and to increasingly higher-level \nofficials within and outside the prison system.  Mr. Hope had proven his ability to bring outside \nattention to TDCJ before: in or around 2009, when one of Mr. Hopeโs advocates alerted then-Texas \nSenator Whitmire that Mr. Treon had housed Mr. Hope in death row at Polunsky, Senator \nWhitmire intervened on Mr. Hopeโs behalf to have TDCJ remove Mr. Hope from death row to a \ndifferent segregation housing section.  Now faced with the possibility that Mr. Hope again would \ncatch the attention of people at the highest levels of TDCJ or of someone outside of TDCJ, the \nClassification Defendants expanded their agreement into a multifaceted scheme whereby they \nattempted  to  silence  Mr.  Hope  and  his  advocates.    They  also  arranged  for  manufactured \ndisciplinary charges against Mr. Hope to provide a ready-made excuse to parrot to Mr. Hope, his \nadvocates, and anyone else who asked why Mr. Hope was still segregated.\n11. To manufacture the disciplinary charges against Mr. Hope and make his daily life \nincreasingly uncomfortable, the Classification Defendants needed to work with a Polunsky officer.  \nThey found willing participants, first in Major Virgil McMullen and later in Polunsky Defendant \nMajor  Rehse.    The  coordinated  acts  of  retaliation  against  Mr.  Hope  by  the  Classification \nDefendants, Polunsky Defendant Rehse, and co-conspirator Mr. McMullen, included:\n๏ท Improperly confiscating Mr. Hopeโs typewriter (which the confiscating officer did \nwhile taunting Mr. Hope that he would need to find a new way to type his \ngrievances without it);\n๏ท Unnecessarily destroying contact information for several of Mr. Hopeโs outside \nadvocates through whom he magnified his voice (and leaving no record of such \nconfiscation on the property report);\n5\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 13 of 80 PageID #:\n625\n๏ท Planting a screwdriver in Mr. Hopeโs cell and then dispatching officers to retrieve \nit, leading to a fabricated disciplinary charge for possession of a weapon and the \nforeseeable use of force via chemical agent against Mr. Hope to retrieve such \nโweaponโ;\n๏ท Leaving Mr. Hope naked and covered in chemicals for days with no way to clean \nhimself and with no clothing or blankets in February;\n๏ท Instituting a โpolicyโ of frequent cell moves where Mr. Hope was shuffled between \ncells more than 260 times in a six-year period and regularly exposed to unsanitary \nand toxic conditions; and\n๏ท Repeatedly denying Mr. Hopeโs release from segregation back into G.P. without a \npenological or security purpose and without due process safeguards.\n12. After 2012, when Mr. Hope was repeatedly moved between cells for no apparent \npurpose, his new cells were often unsanitary and in various states of disrepair.  Some of Mr. Hopeโs \ncells had leaks, broken lights, and unpredictable temperatures.  Even more often, they had not been \ncleaned before Mr. Hope was housed in them, exposing Mr. Hope to mold, feces, urine, vomit, \nand other unsanitary filth, made worse by the lack of proper cleaning supplies made available to \nhim.\n13. As Mr. Hope continuously challenged his mistreatment and pleaded for his release \nto G.P., Polunsky Defendant Rehse and various Classification Defendants made references to \nMr. Hopeโs outside advocates, telling Mr. Hope it did not matter how hard he foughtโhe was \nstaying in solitary confinement.  \n14. This mistreatment continued even after Mr. Treon, the original official who had \nblocked Mr. Hopeโs release to G.P. in 2007, later made a personal call to the Director of \n6\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 14 of 80 PageID #:\n626\nClassifications on Mr. Hopeโs behalf stating that Mr. Treon was not opposed to Mr. Hopeโs release.  \nShockingly, when Mr. Treon asked her if Mr. Hope would ever be allowed out of solitary \nconfinement, the Director of Classification admitted out loud what was supposed to be kept under \nwraps:  โOh no, heโll never get out of Seg.โ5\n15. And the Classification Defendants may have been right, that they never would have \nlet Mr. Hope out of segregation, except that they abruptly changed positions in an attempt to moot \nMr. Hopeโs certiorari petition to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Only upon the filing of \nthat petition was Mr. Hope finally, after nearly three decades, released from segregation to G.P.  \nThis ordeal did not leave Mr. Hope unscathed.  By plotting and executing a retaliatory scheme, by \nhousing him in inhumane conditions, and by discarding him into an indefinite segregation, the \nPolunsky and Classification Defendants caused enormous and irreparable damage to Mr. Hope.\n16. Once out of solitary, Mr. Hope was sent to a transitional program at the Ellis Unit, \nwhere officials made clear upon his arrival that he would be singled out and watched more closely \nthan other prisoners at the same unit.  During Mr. Hopeโs short time at this unit, the Ellis \nDefendants caused permanent damage to Mr. Hopeโs wrists by exerting excessive force when they \nintentionally applied and maintained overly tightened restraints to Mr. Hope while he was being \ntreated at a hospital for respiratory distress in May 2022. \n17. In June 2022, Mr. Hope was transferred to G.P. at the John B. Connally Unit \n(โConnallyโ), where he is still housed today while fighting to rectify years of unconstitutional \ntreatment at Defendantsโ hands.\n5 The Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinement, AL JAZEERA (June 27, 2023) at 13:32-14:48, \nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/program/fault-lines/2023/6/27/the-box-27-years-in-solitary-\nconfinement (โThe Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinementโ).\n7\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 15 of 80 PageID #:\n627\nPARTIES \n18.

MR. HOPE WAS CONFINED TO SEGREGATION FOR 27 YEARS AFTER \nBEING DESIGNATED AN ESCAPE RISK IN 1995\n30. Mr. Hope was initially placed in segregation in February 1995 when TDCJ officials \nplaced an escape risk designation in his file following a 1994 escape from a TDCJ facility.  Mr. \nHope was 26 years old at the time.  \n11\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 19 of 80 PageID #:\n631\n31. For the next 27 years, from 1995 until 2022, Mr. Hope was confined to a 9-foot by \n6-foot cell.  After accounting for fixtures in the cell, Mr. Hope had a mere nine square feet of space \nin which to move around.  Initially, Mr. Hope was housed in the same cell for extended lengths of \ntime, being moved to a new cell only on infrequent occasions.  By 2012, however, Mr. Hope began \ngetting shuffled from cell to cell, often being moved multiple times a week.  Regardless of what \ncell he was placed in, each was approximately the size of a compact parking space, and he was \nalways alone.\n32. Isolation defined Mr. Hopeโs daily life.  In fact, Mr. Hope was 53 years old when \nreleased from segregation to G.P., meaning he had spent over half of his lifetime (including nearly \nall of his adult life) in isolation, deprived of meaningful human contact, mental stimulus, physical \nactivity, and human dignity.\n33. According to TDCJ policy, Mr. Hope could participate in only limited and isolated \nrecreation outside of his cell, his only time outdoors.  He was allowed either one hour of recreation \nper day seven days per week, or two hours per day five days per weekโthat is, he was generally \nnot allowed more than 10 hours per week outside of his cell for these 27 years.  Moreover, because \nof a number of factors, such as weather, unit-wide lockdowns, and staff shortages, Mr. Hope \nfrequently went days, weeks, or even months without recreation (or sunlight).  During such \nperiods, he spent 24 hours per day completely alone in his cell.\n34. Besides recreation, all of Mr. Hopeโs daily activities took place in his solitary cell.  \nHe ate every meal alone, from an often-dirty tray passed through a low, narrow slot in the cell \ndoor.  Even health checks were conducted in his cell, with his sanity and well-being assessed from \nthe opposite side of his cellโs steel doorโand in earshot of the rest of the housing section.  \n12\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 20 of 80 PageID #:\n632\nMr. Hope did everythingโate meals, read and wrote letters, prepared legal documents, and passed \ntimeโsitting on the cellโs thin bed or floor or while standing.\n35. The only consistent physical human contact Mr. Hope experienced throughout \nthese 27 years in solitary confinement was with prison guards as they strip searched his body, \nsearched (or ransacked) his cell, or handcuffed him through the low door slot.  Mr. Hope was \nprohibited from contact visits, and from 1995 until approximately August 2020, was allowed only \na single phone call, after his mother died.  Mr. Hope could not socialize with other prisoners or \nparticipate in religious or vocational activities. \n36. Mr. Hopeโs conditions of confinement in segregation differed notably from those \nin G.P.  In G.P., prisoners could socialize with others in the unit, eat in groups and at a table, work \na job, make personal phone calls, watch television, and participate in prison programming.  \nMr. Hope was strip searched regularly in solitary, often four times per day; in contrast, he would \nhave experienced pat downs in G.P.  G.P. also experienced fewer lockdowns, which meant fewer \nโjohnnieโs,โ the bagged meals provided instead of cooked meals during such periods. \n37. Being kept in segregation restricted Mr. Hopeโs access to property and legal \nmaterials.  Prisoners in segregation are allowed to possess far less propertyโincluding reading \nmaterial, clothing, pictures, and other personal itemsโthan their G.P. counterparts.  And while \nthose in G.P. are allowed to research in the law library and to check out entire books, Mr. Hope \nwas only permitted to request legal materials three cases at a time and only three times per week \n(or less, depending on holiday and staffing schedules).  These restrictions impaired his access to \nthe courts, including in advance of filing his pro se complaint in this case.\n13\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 21 of 80 PageID #:\n633\nII. THE PROCESS USED TO REVIEW MR. HOPEโS SEGREGATION WAS \nREPEATEDLY INTERFERED WITH, RENDERING IT MEANINGLESS\n38. As  detailed  below,  Mr.  Hope  was  entitled  to  have  his  placement  in  solitary \nconfinement reviewed by the SCC.  After the Security Precautions Designator Review Committee \n(โSPDRCโ) found Mr. Hope was no longer an escape risk, the SCC decided at an April 2007 \nreview hearing to return Mr. Hope to G.P.  This decision made sense, as the SCC reviews the same \nprisoner file that the SPDRC reviews.  Yet the SCCโs decision was inexplicably overruledโ\nreportedly by Mr. Treon in โadministration,โโand then all record of the April review mysteriously \ndisappeared from Mr. Hopeโs file when he appeared before SCC member Jones, who agreed to \ndefer to Mr. Treon.  A similar pattern repeated in 2010 when the SCC again decided to release \nMr. Hope to G.P., but again the decision was reversed outside of the proper appeals processโand \nagain due to interference from then SCC Chair Jones.\nA. Mr. Hope Was Entitled To Meaningful Reviews Of His Segregation \nPlacement\n39. Mr. Hope, like all TDCJ prisoners in solitary confinement, was entitled to a review \nhearing  before  the  SCC  every  180  days  (i.e.,  every  six  months)  to  have  his  placement  in \nsegregation reviewed for potential release into G.P.  \n40. SCC review hearings are conducted by (1) a representative of the SCC, (2) the \nwarden or designee, and (3) other staff (e.g., medical or building staff) as deemed appropriate.  \nUpon  information  and  belief,  although  the  warden  and  other  staff  are  present,  the  SCC \nrepresentative has final decision-making authority at an SCC review hearing.\n41. Prior to a review hearing, a prisoner has the right to receive notice of the hearing, \nincluding of any specified reasons for their continued placement in solitary.  Prisoners have the \nright to attend the review hearing (unless they pose a threat to security), to give their own \nstatement, and to submit written witness statements and other documentary evidence.\n14\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 22 of 80 PageID #:\n634\n42. Such evidence is supposed to form the basis for the SCCโs decision about whether \ncontinued solitary placement is justified, along with considerations regarding whether the prisoner \nbeing reviewed โwould still be: [a] current escape risk; [a] physical threat to staff or other \noffenders; [or a] threat to the order and security of the prison as evidenced by repeated, serious \ndisciplinary violations.โ8  In that assessment, the SCC must evaluate a variety of factors related to \nthe  prisonerโs  time  in  segregation,  including  disciplinary  violations  (and  their  severity  and \nfrequency), medical evaluations, relationships with other prisoners and staff, participation in \nprograms, and the prisonerโs desire to remain in or stated readiness to leave segregation.\n43. The SCC โmakes final decisions regarding administrative segregation.โ9  And after \na review hearing, the SCC is to provide the prisoner with โa written decision stating the reasons \nfor the decisions and summarizing the information presented and considered.โ10  Prisoners have \nthe right to appeal the SCCโs final decisions through the grievance process.  A warden may also \nchallenge a SCC decision by appealing to the Departmental Review Board, which hears the appeal \nand issues a decision.11\nB. In 2005, TDCJ Removed Mr. Hopeโs Escape Risk Designation \n44. From 1995, when Mr. Hope was first placed in solitary, until 2005, the SCC based \nits decision to keep Mr. Hope in segregation on his โescape riskโ designator.  However, in 2005, \n8 TDCJ Administrative Segregation Plan (March 2012) at 17, 30 (emphasis added), available at \nhttps://tifa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Administrative-Segregation-Death-Row-Plan-1.pdf \n(the โAd. Seg. Planโ).  The 2012 plan superseded the 2005 plan, which, upon information and \nbelief, outlined the same substantive criteria to be considered at SCC review hearings (emphasis \nadded).\n9  TDCJ  Offender  Orientation  Handbook  at  7  (Feb.  2017),  available  at \nhttps://www.tdcj.texas.gov/documents/Offender_Orientation_Handbook_English.pdf\n10 Ad. Seg. Plan at 17.\n11 Ad. Seg. Plan at 31.\n15\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 23 of 80 PageID #:\n635\nthe SPDRC removed this designator from Mr. Hopeโs file, indicating that the escapeโmore than \na decade earlierโcould no longer justify keeping him in solitary.  Its removal reflected a judgment \nthat, after 10 years in solitary without any escape attempt, neither Mr. Hopeโs behavior nor other \ncircumstances indicated that Mr. Hope still posed an escape risk.  Because this designator was the \nreason Mr. Hope was placed in segregation, and because there was no evidence that Mr. Hope \npresented a physical threat or of repeated serious disciplinary violations, its removal sent a \nsignificant message: TDCJ no longer had a valid security interest in keeping Mr. Hope from being \nreleased to G.P.\nC. In 2007, The SCC Decided Mr. Hope โShallโ Be Released From Solitary, But \nThat Decision Was Reversed Without Explanation\n45. On or around April 4, 2007, with no escape risk designator in his file, and 12 years \nsince his placement in solitary, the SCC decided to release Mr. Hope to G.P.  SCC member Steven \nRogers communicated this decision to Mr. Hope at the review hearing and recorded it on the SCC \nReview Hearing Record, checking the box for โThe offender shall [] [b]e released to General \nPopulation.โ  Under the section for โthe basis for Committee decision,โ Mr. Rogers checked the \nbox for โOtherโโall other options provide reasons to hold someone in solitary, with no prefilled \noptions providing bases for releaseโand wrote in that it had been 12 years since his escape, he no \nlonger had an escape risk designator, and Mr. Hope displayed a โgood attitude.โ\n46. Despite what was decided at the SCC review hearing and recorded on the form, \nMr. Hope was not released from segregation to G.P. in 2007 and instead was transferred to \nsegregation at the Polunsky Unit.  Upon information and belief, this change was made based on \ninstructions from Regional Director Robert Treon, who had been the warden of the unit from which \nMr. Hope had escaped years earlier, and who now had oversight of the Polunsky Unitโwhere Mr. \n16\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 24 of 80 PageID #:\n636\nHope would be housed with those on death row.12  Mr. Treon has since explained in a 2023 \ninterview with the media that for years he was embarrassed by Mr. Hopeโs escape.13\n47. When Mr. Hope grieved this unexpected change, Polunsky Assistant Warden Billy \nHirsch told Mr. Hope: โYou were transferred by State Classification to the Polunsky Unit with \ninstructions that you remain in security detention.  You will remain in Administrative Segregation \nuntil State Classification changes your status.โ  However, when Mr. Hope followed up with Major \nNelson, who was responsible for cell assignments in Polunskyโs segregation unit, Ms. Nelson \nresponded that she had not received a copy of the April 4, 2007 SCC Review Hearing Record, but \nthat she was told by Mr. Rogers that his decision to release Mr. Hope to G.P. was โoverturned by \nthe Administration,โ and consequently, Mr. Hope would remain in solitary confinement.\nD. Mr. Hope Expressed His Concerns To The SCC And TDCJ Officials\n48. Following the administrationโs surprise reversal, Mr. Hope repeatedly contacted \nMr. Rogers, other SCC members, and TDCJ officials asking why the SCCโs decision was not \nupheld and what he must do in order to be released from solitary to G.P.  Mr. Hope had his outside \nadvocates also contact Mr. Rogers, including in or about January 2008.\n49. Resulting from this letter campaign, SCC member Rogers communicated to one of \nMr. Hopeโs advocates that Mr. Treon would never allow Mr. Hope to be released from solitary to \nG.P., so Mr. Hope would need to wait until Mr. Treon left TDCJ.  Despite the SPDRC finding that \nMr. Hope posed no escape risk, Mr. Treon had reportedly convinced Mr. Rogers that Mr. Rogers \nwould be held responsible if Mr. Hope were released to G.P. only to escape again.  Mr. Hope also \n12 A warden may challenge an SCC decision by adhering to a defined process.  See Ad. Seg. Plan \nat 31.  Upon information and belief, in the instances when the SCCโs decision to release Mr. Hope \nto G.P. were overturned, no such challenges or appeals had occurred.  \n13 The Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinement, at 6:34.\n17\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 25 of 80 PageID #:\n637\nexpressed his concerns directly to Mr. Treon, including in letters sent in or about June 2007 and \nJanuary 2008. \nE. The SCC โLostโ Its Copy Of The 2007 Decision Approving Mr. Hopeโs \nRelease To General Population \n50. Then-SCC member Vanessa Jones conducted Mr. Hopeโs next SCC review hearing \nonly three months later, on or about July 13, 2007, instead of at the regular 6-month interval.  \nMr. Hope asked Ms. Jones why he was being reviewed again so soon, and he showed her his copy \nof the April 4, 2007 Review Hearing Record for his release to G.P.  She acted surprised to see he \nhad been reviewed recently.  Ms. Jones claimed his file had no record of the April review or release \ndecision and asked Mr. Hope for his copy.  Mr. Hope offered to let her photocopy it in his presence \nbut declined to give up his only copy of the paperwork.  Mr. Rogers later admitted to Mr. Hope \nand his advocate that Mr. Rogers had torn up the SCCโs copy of his release form based on \nMr. Treonโs instruction not to leave a paper trail.\n51. Upon information and belief, Ms. Jonesโs attempt to take Mr. Hopeโs copy of his \nApril form was intended to serve the same purpose.  Ms. Jones had a close relationship with \nMr. Treon; she had come up through TDCJ under Mr. Treon and had worked closely with him as \nhis Unit Classification Chief when Mr. Treon was Warden at the now-Polunsky Unit.  And \nMs. Jonesโs agreement to uphold Mr. Treonโs wishes was further reinforced when she told \nMr. Hope at the July 2007 review hearing that she would not release him to G.P. without first \ngiving Mr. Treon the option to speak with Mr. Hope and approve the decision.\n52. Like Mr. Rogers, other SCC members at subsequent review hearings echoed this \nfear of repercussions if they were to release Mr. Hope to G.P.  For example, SCC member Maryann \nComstock expressed a willingness to release Mr. Hope to G.P. but for a note in his file indicating \nSCC members should consult Mr. Treon before releasing Mr. Hope.\n18\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 26 of 80 PageID #:\n638\nF. Administrators Dangled A Release From SolitaryโIf Mr. Hope Behaved \nWith The Media\n53. Mr. Hope spoke with Mr. Treon in or around October 2009.  At the time, Mr. Hope \nhad recently been interviewed for a documentary program โBreakoutโ on โRaw TVโ about his \ntime in solitary.  The film was set to air on the National Geographic channel for the first time in \nthe coming days.  Mr. Treon said he would release Mr. Hope from solitary to G.P. after the filmโs \nrelease if Mr. Hope had not said anything that โsounded crazyโ during his interview.  However, \nMr. Treon did not speak to Mr. Hope again prior to Mr. Treonโs retirement from TDCJ.\nG. In 2010, The SCC Again Decided Mr. Hope โShallโ Be Released To General \nPopulationโYet Again Mr. Hope Was Left In Solitary Indefinitely \n54. In January of 2010, after Mr. Treon retired, Mr. Rogers again decided at an SCC \nreview hearing to release Mr. Hope from solitary to G.P, and again noted his decision on the SCC \nReview Hearing Record.  Two correctional officers confirmed to Mr. Hope that they understood \nhe was being released to G.P.  Yet, again, the SCCโs decision was changed without explanation or \nopportunity for meaningful appeal when Vanessa Jones, then SCC Chair, intervened.\n55. On or around February 23, 2010, a sergeant informed Mr. Hope that he would not \nbe released to G.P., notwithstanding the SCCโs January decision.  Mr. Hope filed a grievance \nasking for an explanation.  In April, Mr. Hope received a response to his grievance stating that the \nSCC ChairโMs. Jonesโhad reversed the SCCโs January decision to release him from solitary to \nG.P. \n56. Upon information and belief, prior to Mr. Hopeโs next review hearing, Ms. Jones \ncontacted several SCC members and mandated they keep Mr. Hope in segregation.  For example, \nin or around July 2010, at his next SCC review hearing, SCC member Lovelady explained that she \nhad spoken to Ms. Jones who had instructed her to keep Mr. Hope in solitary.\n19\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 27 of 80 PageID #:\n639\n57. In August 2010, Ms. Jones responded to a letter Mr. Hope had sent her in or around \nMarch 2010 regarding her reversal of the SCCโs January 2010 release decision.  Ms. Jones \nattempted to justify overturning the decision, writing to Mr. Hope that although his escape risk \ndesignation had been removed because of the length of time that had elapsed without incident, his \ncase was still considered โunusual and difficult,โ and she would not implement SCC review \nhearing decisions for his release without additional approval by the Chair or Vice-Chair of \nClassification and Records.  Mr. Hope was not given an explanation for how or why this \nundocumented characterization was applied to his case or what must be done to have it removed, \nor whether the Chair or Vice-Chair of Classification and Records had even been asked to approve \nthe SCCโs January release decision.  Neither was he allowed to challenge the application of this \ncharacterization to his case.  Mr. Hope again sent letters to the SCC, including to Ms. Jones and \nthe Chair of Classification and Records.\nIII. THE CLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS ENTERED A CONSPIRACY TO \nRETALIATE AGAINST MR. HOPE\n58. By 2011, the SCC had twice decided to release Mr. Hope from solitary to G.P.โ\nand twice those decisions were reversed after the fact without explanation.  As explained further \nbelow, Mr. Hope was outspoken in challenging these reversals and other issues he had with his \nreview process, and his and his advocatesโ communications were met with resistance.  What had \nstarted out as interference from Mr. Treon, and then progressed to Ms. Jones ceding authority to \nMr. Treon, now became an agreement to retaliate against Mr. Hope for his protected activities.  \nNow as SCC Chair, Ms. Jones spent most of her time in Huntsville at administrative headquarters, \nwhere the Classification Defendants were also based at overlapping times.  From behind closed \ndoors, Ms. Jones and the Classification Defendants emerged with a single, unified response:  Mr. \nHope was to remain in solitary indefinitelyโor at least until the group changed its mind.\n20\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 28 of 80 PageID #:\n640\n59. This agreement began a years-long pattern in which various members of the SCC \nvacillated at review hearings between sometimes disclaiming any authority whatsoever to release \nMr. Hope to G.P., and other times assuring him he would be released to G.P., only for that decision \nto be inexplicably reversed with no meaningful opportunity to appeal.  Regardless of the position \nthey took, the result was the same: Mr. Hope was left in segregation indefinitely with no guidance \non what he could do to be released back to G.P. or who had the authority to make such a decision.\n60. Going  forward  after  his  2010  review  hearings,  Mr.  Hope  prepared  written \nstatements that he brought to and submitted at each of his subsequent SCC review hearings, in \naddition to continuing to send letters to the SCC and classification officials.  Oftentimes, however, \nthe single SCC member who attended the review hearing failed to even read the letter.  Instead, at \nmost of Mr. Hopeโs review hearings, an SCC member would begin by announcing that he would \nremain in solitary confinement.  Only then would the SCC member ask Mr. Hope if he wanted to \nmake a statement.  Mr. Hopeโs review hearing in or about January 2014 before Classification \nDefendant Fiveash provides an example.  Mr. Hope submitted a written statement but, Ms. Fiveash \ndid not consider it and marked the box that he had submitted nothing for consideration.  As a result \nof these predetermined results, Mr. Hope spent another 12 years in solitary confinement, without \nany meaningful process by which to have his status reviewed.\n61. At several review hearings, SCC members disclaimed any ability to review or \nrelease Mr. Hope from segregation.  For example, at one such review hearing on or around June \n11, 2015, SCC member Armstrong told Mr. Hope, in sum or substance, simply that โthereโs \nnothing I can do for you.โ  SCC member Sheila Leblanc told Mr. Hope she had no problem with \nhim being in G.P. but did not want responsibility for the decision herself.\n21\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 29 of 80 PageID #:\n641\n62. Other SCC members claimed someone else had authority over whether to release \nMr. Hope to G.P., despite those other officials never being present at the review hearings.  For \nexample, SCC member Bilnoski told Mr. Hope he would have released Mr. Hope, but an \nunidentified administrative committee had just reviewed Mr. Hope, and Mr. Bilnoski could not \noverrule their determination.\n63. On a rare occasion when Mr. Hope appeared at a review hearing before someone \nwilling to actually review him, such as in or around June 2014 before SCC member Buckner, Ms. \nBuckner decided to release Mr. Hope to G.P., but then mysteriously changed her mind a week after \nreturning to Huntsville.\n64. Mr. Hope received different treatment than other prisoners in solitary, including \nsome who also had previous escapes.  In fact, one of the two prisoners who had escaped with Mr. \nHope in 1994 was released to G.P. in approximately 2004 (just before Mr. Hopeโs escape risk \ndesignator was removed), and the second was released several years laterโfacts Mr. Hope pointed \nout to the SCC and Classification Defendants in his letters.  SCC members Bilnoski and Rogers \nonce had Mr. Hope brought to them outside the confines of an official review hearing, further \nindicating that Mr. Hope was being discussed outside the regular review process. \nA. The Grievance Process Provided No Meaningful Opportunity For Appeal\n65. Unable to get answers from the SCC and unsure what more he could do to be \nreleased to G.P., or to ensure he was at least reviewed by someone with the authority to make \nrelease decisions, Mr. Hope continued to pursue any options available to him.  One such avenue \nwas through the grievance process.  A prisoner can appeal an SCC review hearing decision by \nfiling a grievance.  Mr. Hope did so, including in or around July 2011 and multiple subsequent \ntimes in the years since.  He filed grievances related to SCC review hearings conducted by \n22\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 30 of 80 PageID #:\n642\nClassification Defendants Bennett, Enloe, and Fiveash, where Mr. Hope challenged the review \nhearing process and explained the SCCโs apparent lack of authority.\n66. The problem, however, was that the filed grievances were responded to by unit \nofficials, not by SCC members or classification officials with authority over the SCC process.  In \none representative response to such grievances, a warden told Mr. Hope that his release was โat \nthe discretion of the State Classification officeโ and that Mr. Hope would โneed to discuss the \nissue during [his] next State classification hearing.โ  Mr. Hope received similar responses from the \nTDCJ Office of the Independent Ombudsman, including in or around November 2015.\n67. In practical terms, this pattern meant that Mr. Hopeโs โappealsโ never reached \nanyone with authority to review or change the outcome.  Unit officials insisted that only the SCC \nhad the ability to release Mr. Hope to G.P., but SCC official after SCC official insisted they did \nnot have the necessary authority.  Thus, no actual process for release was available to Mr. Hope. \nB. The Classification Defendants Grew Angry With Mr. Hopeโs Outreach\n68. Another avenue Mr. Hope pursued was through his letters, which he and his \nadvocates sent increasingly often and to increasingly higher-ranking officialsโeven to people \noutside of TDCJ who Mr. Hope thought might be able to help. \n69. In 2011, for example, Mr. Hope sent letters to the SCC, SCC member Jones, and \nTDCJ Deputy Director Thomas Prasifka, among others.  In these and other letters, Mr. Hope \nexpressed his concerns with his SCC review hearings and the lack of clarity regarding who had \nthe authority to release him to G.P., disclosed how solitary was causing or contributing to medical \nissues with his heart, cholesterol, and back, and explained how being denied release to G.P. meant \nhe would not be paroled despite otherwise being eligible.\n70. His letter writing campaign continued in subsequent years as well, with additional \ncommunications directed to both specific SCC members and to the SCC generally, and to \n23\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 31 of 80 PageID #:\n643\nClassification Defendants White, Enloe, and Echessa, and others with roles in or oversight of \nclassifications and the review process.  Mr. Hope also wrote to officials outside the prison system, \nincluding  multiple  letters  to  then-Texas  Senator  John  Whitmire,  hoping  the  Senator  could \ninvestigate or speak to someone at TDCJ on his behalf.\n71. Outside advocatesโoften at Mr. Hopeโs request or with his permission, although \noccasionally on their own and without his knowledgeโdid the same through letters and phone \ncalls.  These communications were on matters of significant public concernโthe treatment of \nthose in our criminal justice system and the operation of Texas prisons generallyโas well as \nMr. Hopeโs treatment specifically.  Advocates wrote letters to Classification Defendants White, \nEnloe, and Echessa, and others both at TDCJ and outside of the system, and made calls and spoke \nwith officials, including Classification Defendants White and Echessa.  As email became an \nincreasingly preferred form of communication, Mr. Hope drafted messages on his typewriter or by \nhand, which he then mailed to his advocates to send as emails to officials on his behalf.  When \npossible, Mr. Hopeโs advocates spoke with officials in person, either at Polunsky or at TDCJ \nmeetings open to the public.\n72. Mr. Hope had followed protocol, was typically at the highest level of privileges \nwithin segregation due to good behavior and minimal disciplinary infractions, and completed every \neducational program available to him, but the SCC seemed determined to hold him to a shifting \nstandard, without explaining what that standard entailed.  Mr. Hope did not know what else he was \nrequired to do to be released to G.P., and he could not find anyone willing to provide an answer.\n73. SCC and classification officials often took more than a month to respond to \nMr. Hopeโs letters and those of his advocatesโif they bothered to respond at all.  At times, Mr. \nHope had to send repetitive letters to the same person following up on a single question in order \n24\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 32 of 80 PageID #:\n644\nto receive a response.  Other times, he and his advocates received only generic responses to their \noutreach and had to send additional messages repeating their questions that the official had failed \nto answer in their stock response.  Still other times, Mr. Hope and his advocates resorted to \ncontacting the TDCJ Ombudsmanโs Office pleading for help because too many of their calls and \nmessages to the SCC and classification had gone unanswered (although this proved futile as the \nOmbudsmanโs Office would only refer them to the SCC for classification-related questions).\n74. When Classification Defendants did respond, they often made clear that they found \nMr. Hopeโs outreach to be bothersome and discouraged him and his advocates from continuing to \ncontact them.  For example, in response to one advocate who reached out to Classification \nDefendant White at Mr. Hopeโs request regarding SCC members disclaiming authority to make \nrelease decisions, Ms. White expressed that it was unnecessary for anyone to contact her again.  \nSimilarly, at an SCC review hearing where Classification Defendant Enloe claimed to have been \nsent by Ms. White, Ms. Enloe told Mr. Hope that his and his advocatesโ outreach efforts would not \nget him out of segregation.\nC. Mr. Hope Upset Officers By Questioning Improper Disciplinary Cases\n75. In or around October 2011, the recently promoted then-Major Virgil McMullen \nsuddenly banned razor blades in Mr. Hopeโs building.  Loose razor blades had long been allowed \nfor their multiple legitimate uses, such as shaving, cutting food, sharpening pencils, and trimming \ntoenails.  Under the secret new rule (which applied only to Mr. Hopeโs building), possession of \nloose razor blades was suddenly prohibited.  Upon information and belief, Mr. McMullen designed \nthe change, at least in part, to issue possession of weapon disciplinary cases to prisoners in solitary, \nmaking them appear more dangerous and making it harder for them to be released to G.P.\n76. Unsurprisingly,  when  Mr.  McMullen  instructed  Officer  Tatum  to  search \nMr. Hopeโs cell in or about mid-October 2011 (just a week after Mr. Hopeโs advocatesโ most recent \n25\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 33 of 80 PageID #:\n645\nletter to Deputy Director Prasifka), Mr. Tatum found five loose razor bladesโeach previously \nissued to Mr. Hope by officers and in his possession for some time.  Because Mr. McMullen \ninstructed Mr. Tatum to issue possession of weapon cases rather than lesser, possession of \ncontraband cases, Mr. Hope received a serious charge, despite not having demonstrated an intent \nto use the loose razors as weapons (as is required for a possession of weapon charge).  \n77. On or about October 28, 2011, an unusually brief few days after the incident, \nCaptain Virgil Miller heard Mr. Hopeโs disciplinary case and entered a finding for possession of a \nweapon.  The offense impacted Mr. Hopeโs privileges level in solitary and his parole eligibility.\n78. Mr. Hope filed a grievance about this excessive charge (which was denied at Step 1 \nand Step 2 reviews) and wrote a letter to Polunskyโs warden.  Because of his letter, the Warden \nscheduled a meeting among himself, Mr. Hope, Mr. McMullen, and Mr. Miller.  At the meeting, \nMr. Miller admitted he had found Mr. Hope guilty of possession of a weapon because Mr. \nMcMullen had instructed him to do so.  The Warden agreed Mr. McMullen had overstepped but \nsaid there was nothing he could do because Mr. Hopeโs grievance had already been denied.\n79. Years later, Mr. Hope discovered another avenue for challenging this charge.  Still \nconcerned about the severe implications of a guilty finding of โpossession of weaponโ on his \nrecord, Mr. Hope wrote to Regional Director of Discipline Amy Oliver.  In or around September \n2015, Ms. Oliver ultimately agreed to reduce the charge to possession of contraband, as the \nincident did not meet the definition of possession of a weapon.  As a lesser offense, possession of \ncontraband could not be used as a justification to keep Mr. Hope (or anyone) in solitary.\nIV. THE CLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS EXPANDED THEIR AGREEMENT TO \nSEGREGATE MR. HOPE INDEFINITELY, AND TRIED TO SHIELD \nTHEMSELVES FROM SCRUTINY \n80. Mr. Hope had communicated extensivelyโusing all means available to him from \nhis solitary cell as well as working through outside advocates with greater abilities to amplify his \n26\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 34 of 80 PageID #:\n646\nvoiceโand the message to the Classification Defendants was clear: Mr. Hope was, and would \ncontinue, challenging his indefinite segregation, bringing awareness to flaws in his review process \nand seeking an explanation as to how he could be kept in solitary for years on end with no escape \nrisk designator and with largely clean disciplinary records.  Mr. Hope and his advocates were \nunsatisfied with the stock responses being given to them and demanded more.  This challenge \nmeant that Mr. McMullenโs sensationalized possession of weapons case came at the perfect time \nfor the Classification Defendantsโ needs: it provided a concrete example to which they could point \nas a justification for why Mr. Hope remained in segregation.  Indeed, SCC members brought up \nthis โmajorโ disciplinary offense at future SCC review hearings as an excuse to deny Mr. Hopeโs \nrelease to G.P., and the incident was cited by the Classification Defendants in responses to \nMr. Hopeโs advocates as the purported justification for keeping Mr. Hope in segregation.\n81. Still, even a possession of weapons case could not justify keeping Mr. Hope in \nsolitary forever.  The Classification Defendants needed yet another, more egregious, pretext to \nkeep Mr. Hope in solitary and to immunize themselves from the scrutiny caused by Mr. Hopeโs \ncontinuously  contacting  TDCJ  officials  who  outranked  them,  state  legislators,  and  media \nmembers.  Mr. McMullen would again provide that cover just two months later.\nA. Major  McMullen  Provided  The  Classification  Defendants  With  Another \nExcuse To Keep Mr. Hope In Segregation\n82. By 2012, word had spread that Mr. McMullen did not like Mr. Hope.  For example, \nafter the meeting with the warden and Mr. McMullen about the loose razors, Mr. Hope heard from \nan officer assigned to his housing area that Mr. McMullen was โnot happyโ that Mr. Hope had \nchallenged his authority and written grievances about Mr. McMullenโs policies.  Similarly, \nMr. Hope was told by a different officer that Mr. McMullen โhatedโ Mr. Hope because of how \n27\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 35 of 80 PageID #:\n647\nMr. Hope had spoken to and about Mr. McMullen in front of the Warden about the improper \ncharge.\n83. In or about January 2012, Mr. Hope had an SCC review hearing where Major \nMcMullen  and  then-Lieutenant  Paul  Tolly  participated.    Upon  information  and  belief, \nMr. McMullenโs anger at Mr. Hope and involvement in his recent trumped-up disciplinary case \ncontributed  to  Mr.  McMullen  being  selected  to  join  this  review  hearing  panel.    Having \nMr. McMullen on the SCC panel meant that Mr. McMullen and the SCC members were able to \nspeak privately, including in the moments leading up to and after Mr. Hopeโs hearing when their \nattention was focused on keeping Mr. Hope in solitary.\n84. The extent of Mr. McMullenโs and the SCCโs conversations about Mr. Hope that \nday was soon revealed.  Several days after the review hearing, Mr. McMullen remarked to \nMr. Hope as he passed his cell that, in sum or substance, โYou can have anyone you want call us, \nbut itโs not going to help.  Youโre staying in Seg.โ  At that time, Mr. Hopeโs advocates had spoken \nwith SCC and classification officials about the sensationalized charge for the loose razors, but no \none outside of Mr. Hope had contacted Mr. McMullen.  Instead, this foreboding comment \nindicated that Mr. McMullen had partnered with the conspirators so that they now viewed \nthemselves as an โusโ against Mr. Hope.  To make sure that threat came true, Mr. McMullen and \nthe Classification Defendant conspirators orchestrated a grievous campaign of retaliation against \nMr. Hope, put into action the following month.\nB. In February 2012, The Conspirators Directed An Improper Confiscation Of \nMr. Hopeโs Property And Planted A Screwdriver In His Cell\n85. Within a few weeks of Mr. McMullenโs ominous threat that he had partnered with \nthe conspirators (to form an โusโ) to keep Mr. Hope in segregation, Mr. Hopeโs cell was searched \nand the typewriter he used to write grievances and letters to classification officials was confiscated.\n28\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 36 of 80 PageID #:\n648\n86. In  or  around  February  2012,  at  Mr.  McMullenโs  instruction,  Officer  Helen \nSheffield, Officer Burke, and several others arrived to search Mr. Hopeโs cell and sent him to wait \nat the shower.  After about an hour, Mr. Hope peered through the slit in the shower door and saw \nhis typewriter in the hallway.  Panicked, he yelled over to ask why.  Ms. Sheffield responded, in \nsum or substance, โI guess youโll have to find a different way to file grievances.โ  Following \nthrough with her threat, Ms. Sheffield took the typewriter.  Although she wrote in the confiscation \nreport that the typewriterโs wiring appeared altered, Mr. Hope had not altered the typewriter in any \nway since purchasing it directly from Polunskyโs commissaryโand it was in the same condition \nas it had been only days earlier when a different searching officer found no problem with it.\n87. Although Mr. Hope later grieved the improper confiscation, his grievance was \ndenied and his typewriter was never returned.  This confiscation hindered Mr. Hopeโs ability to \nfile grievances (which the TDCJ Offender Handbook instructed should be โtype[d] if possibleโ14), \nsend letters to the officials, and communicate with those advocating on his behalf.  Ultimately, \nMr. Hope had to spend $225 to buy a new typewriter from commissary and live with the fear that \nhis new one too could be confiscated at any time.\n88. When Mr. Hope was returned to his cell after Officer Sheffieldโs confiscations, he \ndiscovered  that  his  personal  belongings,  including  legal  communications  and  grievance \npaperwork, had been strewn about and a pen smeared with peanut butter stuck on his papers, \ndestroying all previous efforts he had made to organize his files.  Mr. Hope discovered that several \npages of his ledger, which contained contact information for the outside advocates working with \nhim to challenge his indefinite solitary confinement, were missing.  These pages were not listed \n14 TDCJ Offender Handbook (2004) at 53; see also TDCJ Offender Handbook (2017) at 74.\n29\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 37 of 80 PageID #:\n649\non Ms. Sheffieldโs confiscation report, although as Mr. Hope continued inquiring in the following \nweeks, Officer Sheffield eventually admitted in writing that she had taken the pages.\n89. As Mr. Hope continued cleaning up the mess, he noticed the officers had left behind \na red bag under his toilet.  He picked it up, unrolled it, and discovered a 10-inch screwdriver.\nC. Minutes Later, The Conspirators Sent Officers After The Planted โWeaponโ \nAnd Repeatedly Deployed A Chemical Agent\n90. It is unusual to have two cell searches within days of each other; it is extremely \nunusual to have two cell searches within the same hour.  Yet, that is what happened on this day in \nFebruary 2012.  It had never happened to Mr. Hope before, and it has never happened since.\n91. Approximately 15 minutes after he found the screwdriver, a second group of \nofficersโincluding then-Lieutenant Tolly, who had been at the January SCC review hearing with \nMr. McMullenโcame to search Mr. Hopeโs cell,15 before Mr. Hope even had a chance to decide \nwho he could safely contact about returning the screwdriver.\n92. Now wary that the screwdriver had been purposefully planted,16 Mr. Hope asked \nthe officers to return with a camera.  He feared the officers would claim the screwdriver was an \nescape tool and the SCC would use it as an excuse to keep him in solitary for years longer, so \n15 The group also included Officers Burke, Charles Mann, Runyon, Amanda Maddox, and Aaron \nBaker, now a captain, along with then-Sergeant and now Warden Terry Andrews. \n16 Mr. Hopeโs concerns proved to be well founded.  Six years after the screwdriver was planted in \nMr. Hopeโs cell, Major McMullen and others were the subject of an OIG investigation and a \nlawsuit for, among other misconduct, planting screwdrivers in a prisonerโs cell as retaliation for \nfiling grievances; as a result, multiple officers were indicted, terminated, resigned, or demoted and \ntransferred.  See Keri Blakinger, 4 Texas Prison Officials Indicted after Alleged Screwdriver-\nPlanting  Incident  at  Brazoria  Lockup,  HOUSTON  CHRONICLE  (July  11,  2018), \nhttps://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/4-Texas-prison-officials-indicted-after-\nalleged-13064474.php (โThe Office of the Inspector General launched an investigation and found \nthe claim had merit.โ); Giese v. Jackson, No. 3:19-CV-00081, 2020 WL 3493078, at *4 (S.D. Tex. \nMay 27, 2020) (finding that โthe summary judgment record contains evidence that McMullen \n[was] aware of [a prisonerโs] grievancesโ and โact[ed] against himโ by โplant[ing] screwdriverโs \nin [the prisonerโs] cellโ).\n30\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 38 of 80 PageID #:\n650\nMr. Hope wanted a recording of him peacefully and willingly returning the screwdriver and \nreflecting that it was TDCJโs screwdriver to ensure officers could not switch it out later for a \nprison-made screwdriver to discredit him.  The officers refused.  Mr. Hope nudged the screwdriver \nthrough the mesh screen of his cell.  He believed the officers would agree to get the video camera \nif he showed them he had their screwdriver and wanted to return it.  When they still refused, \nMr. Hope withdrew the screwdriver in a final effort to have the officers bring a video camera to \nhis cell.\n93. This effort was successful but not in the way Mr. Hope had expected.  Officers \nreturned with a video camera, as policy required when there was a risk of use of force, and with \nMr. McMullen.  Instead of allowing Mr. Hope to return the item on camera, officers entered his \ncell with immediate force.  Sergeant Andrews sprayed a chemical agent directly into Mr. Hopeโs \nface and body, triggering at least five bursts from the canister.  Mr. Hope was instantly enveloped \nin a painful burning sensation and fell to the floor.  The officers then forced Mr. Hope to strip \nnaked, handcuffed him, and moved him to a different cell, where the officers disabled the sinkโs \nrunning water.  Mr. Hope was left naked and alone, covered with the chemical residue for days.  \nOn the fourth day, he received only a pair of underwear but still had no way to clean the chemicals \noff his body without water (let alone soap).  Only on the eighth day was Mr. Hope given his \nclothing and property back and allowed to shower, despite standard policy that prisoners be offered \nthe chance to shower daily.  In a later conversation with Sergeant Andrews, Mr. Hope learned that \nMr. McMullen had mandated that Mr. Hope not be allowed to wash off the chemicals.\n94. It was February, and he was left with no clothing or blankets,17 though Mr. Hopeโs \nskin burned with artificial warmth from the chemicals.  Chemical residue coated every surface of \n17 In fact, blankets were withheld from Mr. Hope for almost a full month, despite the winter chill.\n31\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 39 of 80 PageID #:\n651\nhis property, which he had no way to clean, so every possession he touched, every paper he tried \nto read or letter he tried to write, caused him physical pain for weeks.  And for weeks Mr. Hope \nhad trouble tasting food because all he could taste was the chemical spray.  This was a life-altering \nincident for Mr. Hope, and his nightmares, anxiety, and depression from this extreme and \ninhumane series of acts continue to this day.\n95. Around this time, Mr. McMullen and Mr. Tolly again came by Mr. Hopeโs cell to \nconvey, in sum or in substance, that Mr. Hope was going to learn not to speak out about his \ntreatment or conditions.\n96. Despite  the  controversy  over  whether  the  screwdriver  had  been  planted  in \nMr. Hopeโs cell, the SCC jumped at the chance to cite the possession of weapon charge for the \nscrewdriver as the reason to prolong his segregation.  This fabricated story was first cited at his \nreview hearing in or around July 2012 before SCC member Lovelady.  It was next brought up in \nor around January 2013 when Mr. McMullen again joined SCC member Bilnoski for his review \nhearing.  Mr. McMullen affirmatively brought up the incident, claiming Mr. Hope had overreacted.  \nMr. Bilnoski denied Mr. Hopeโs release to G.P. because, in sum or substance, that incident โdidnโt \nhelp [his] cause.โ\nV. MR. HOPE CONTINUED TO CHALLENGE HIS MISTREATMENT AS \nDEFENDANTS TRIED TO SILENCE HIM\nA. Mr. Hope Continued Speaking Out Against His Mistreatment\n97. Fearful of further retaliation, but with limited options, Mr. Hope filed a grievance \nin or about early March 2012, despite still experiencing burning sensations on his fingers.  In the \ngrievance, he challenged two of the three major disciplinary cases he received arising from the \nplanted screwdriver: assault of an officer and possession of a weapon.  This time he wrote his \n32\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 40 of 80 PageID #:\n652\ngrievance by hand, reminding him of Officer Sheffieldโs taunt when she took his typewriter that \nhe would need to โfind a different way to file grievances.โ\n98. In addition to grievances, Mr. Hope continued his widespread outreach efforts, \nspeaking out about his mistreatment during those February incidents and seeking help from anyone \nseemingly in a position to provide it.  Mr. Hope and his advocates contacted, among others, \nClassification  Defendants  White  and  Enloe,  then-Texas  Senator  Whitmire,  and  a  Senior \nCorrespondent at MSNBC.\n99. Ultimately, Mr. Hopeโs charges were reduced despite his grievance being denied.  \nInstead of being charged with stabbing an officer, which never occurred, the charge was reduced \nto attempt (which also never occurred).  And the possession of a weapon charge for the planted \nscrewdriver was dropped altogether after an investigation concluded the screwdriver belonged to \nMs.  Sheffieldโs  search  team.    Notably,  Mr.  Hope  did  not  challenge  the  refusal-to-follow-\ninstruction charge because he acknowledged that he had refused to follow an instruction while \nwaiting for the officers to bring the video camera.  Instead, he had challenged only those charges \nin which he was accused of doing something he had not done.\nB. The Conspirators Implemented Constant Cell Moves That Unsettled Mr. \nHope And Exposed Him To Inhumane Conditions\n100. As Mr. Hopeโs efforts continued, so did the Classification Defendantsโ and those \nof their co-conspirator, Mr. McMullenโthis time instituting an unofficial โcell-move policyโ \nagainst Mr. Hope.  Previously, Mr. Hope was moved infrequently and spent lengthy periods of \ntime in the same cell throughout his first 17 years in solitary.  In contrast, after 2012, Mr. Hope \nwas moved on a near-constant basisโapproximately 260 times between 2012 and 2018.  This rate \nof moves lacked penological or security purpose and exacted a grave toll on Mr. Hope. \n33\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 41 of 80 PageID #:\n653\n101. At first after the manufactured February incidents, Mr. Hope was on a heightened \nsecurity level, limiting the number of cells available in which he could be placed.  As time passed, \nMr. McMullen and Mr. Tolly were the first to review Mr. Hopeโs housing assignment.  They \ncompleted a form to keep him at a more restrictive (and less desirable) level.  However, a secretary \nsaw the assignment and knew they were mislabeling Mr. Hope, who by that point had graduated \nto the lowest security level in solitary after 90 days without incident. The secretary corrected the \nform, initialing next to her change.  Unfortunately for Mr. Hope, there were more cells available \nfor those on the less-restrictive level and this is when the disruptive cell moves escalated, often to \nmultiple times per week.\n102. On or about March 20, 2013, Mr. Hope was interviewed by a writer from GQ, and \nthe  two  discussed  Mr.  Hopeโs  frequent  cell  moves.18    Within  approximately  two  days, \nMr. McMullen had Mr. Hope brought to his office and questioned him about the interview.  \nApproximately three days later, Mr. McMullen ordered Mr. Hope moved to a cell in a more \nrestrictive (worse) pod despite TDCJ policy of housing prisoners classified at the lowest security \nlevel, which Mr. Hope was on at the time, together in a separate area.  These cell moves continued \nfor years, with Mr. Hope often being moved into seemingly the worst cells available.\n103. This scheme included forcing Mr. Hope into cells in various states of disrepair.  As \none example, on or about June 30, 2015, while Polunsky Defendant Harris was Senior Warden, \nMr. Hope was moved to a cell with no working lights.  Inside the cell, it was so dark that the \nofficers had to use their flashlights to move Mr. Hope into the cell.  Mr. Hope objected, noting \nhow the lack of visibility posed a security and safety risk, but he was threatened with a disciplinary \n18  Alex  Hanneford,  Living  in  a  Box,  GQ,  Nov.  7,  2013,  available  at  https://www.gq-\nmagazine.co.uk/article/solitary-confinement-american-human-rights.\n34\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 42 of 80 PageID #:\n654\ncase for โrefusing to accept housingโ if he did not enter.  Once moved in, Mr. Hope had to fight to \nbe served meals, as officers required the lights to be on at mealtimes.\n104. Mr. Hope was now being moved so frequently that it was difficult for him to address \nconcerns about the inhospitable or unsanitary conditions in one cell before he was moved again.  \nFor example, in or about November 2015, Mr. Hope was moved to a cell smeared with someone \nelseโs feces and urine.  He filed a grievance about this risk to his health, but he was soon moved \nyet again, so by the time he received a response to his grievance, it noted the issue was resolved \nas Mr. Hope was no longer housed in the feces-covered cell about which he had complained.  The \nproblem for Mr. Hope was that he had been moved to a different inhospitable cell.  This timing \nbegan a patternโby the time he could file a grievance and get a response, he would be in yet \nanother different cell, a pattern that allowed the dangers go unremedied.\n105. Still other cells exposed Mr. Hope to excessive heat or cold.  One such cell on or \naround December 30, 2015 (again while Polunsky Defendant Harris was Senior Warden), had no \nheat when it was approximately 38 degrees outside.  Mr. Hopeโs request for heat went unanswered, \nas officers put a โno heatโ notation into the log.  In response to his grievance, an official noted the \nheat was to be repaired, but temperature problems were a common occurrence in Mr. Hopeโs cells.\n106. Mr. Hopeโs many cells often had something else in common: rather than being \nsanitized prior to officers moving Mr. Hope in, many cells contained mold and the urine, feces, \nand vomit of previous occupants, as well as rats and cockroaches.  As but one example, in or \naround November 2016, officers were told to move Mr. Hope into a(nother) cell so covered in the \nprevious inhabitantโs excrement that when Lieutenant Farris and Assistant Warden Smith walked \npast it, they visibly recoiled from the stench.  They were unable to tolerate the odor for mere \n35\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 43 of 80 PageID #:\n655\nmoments, but Mr. Hope was locked inside for days without even being given proper cleaning \nsupplies to improve the filth.\nVI. THE CLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS ACKNOWLEDGED MR. HOPEโS SCC \nREVIEW HEARINGS WERE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE THEY โNEVERโ \nPLANNED TO RELEASE HIM FROM SOLITARY \n107. As Mr. Hopeโs cell transfers increased, so too did the lack of clarity around the \nreview process for his solitary classification.  And with the two-year anniversary of the disciplinary \ncases related to the planted screwdriver approaching, the Classification Defendants pointed to \nother excuses to keep Mr. Hope in segregation.\nA. Realizing The Conspirators Went Too Far, Mr. Treon Pushed For \nMr. Hopeโs ReleaseโBut The Conspirators Admitted Mr. Hope Would \nโNeverโ Get Out Of Segregation\n108. Several years after his retirement, Mr. Treon was visiting Polunsky and saw \nMr. Hope in a segregation cell.  Mr. Treon seemed surprised and asked Mr. Hope what had \nhappened in G.P. that led to Mr. Hope being put back in solitary.  Mr. Hope explained he was still \nfighting to be released from his classification to segregation back in 1995.  Mr. Treon expressed a \nwillingness to help Mr. Hope but explained his voice may no longer carry weight.\n109. Mr. Treon contacted the SCC, explaining that he supported Mr. Hopeโs release to \nG.P., but the SCC said, in sum or substance, that its hands were tied for at least 24 months from \nthe screwdriver incident.\n110. Later on, Mr. Hope wrote to Mr. Treon, asking if he would try again.  Mr. Treon \nrecognized that although Mr. Hope was an escape risk years earlier, he was not the same personโ\nhe was older, demonstrated an ability to follow prison rules, and had never been โan extreme actor \nother than running off.โ19  Mr. Treon called the Director of Classification, whom he knew from \n19 The Box: 27 Years in Solitary Confinement, at 13:32-14:48 (emphasis added).\n36\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 44 of 80 PageID #:\n656\nhis time with TDCJ, and asked to speak about Mr. Hope:  Mr. Treon โsaid โYou know Dennis \nWayne Hope?โ and she goes, โI sure do.โ  I said โAre yโall ever going to let him loose [from \nsegregation]โ and she goes, โoh no, heโll never get out of Seg.โโ20  By this point, Mr. Treon \nrecognized โthe right decision is not always made.โ21\nB. The Classification Defendants Upheld Their Agreement For Mr. Hope To \nโNeverโ Get Out Of Segregation\n111. Just after the two-year clock lapsed from the disciplinary cases resulting from the \nplanted screwdriver, Classification Defendant Enloe responded to the latest set of communications \nfrom Mr. Hopeโs advocates.  In a March 2014 response, and again in May 2014, Ms. Enloe told \nadvocates that a โspecial reviewโ of Mr. Hope was recently conducted by the deputy directors, \nwho decided Mr. Hope must remain in segregation.  Although various SCC members had \ndisclaimed authority to release Mr. Hope, and Mr. Hope had repeatedly asked who, in fact, had \nsuch authority, this was one of the first (but not the last) times he was told someone above the SCC \nhad reviewed him.  Despite asking, neither Mr. Hope nor his advocates could find out which deputy \ndirectors had supposedly reviewed him, when, why, or what their role was in his review process.\n112. In the coming years, Mr. Hope and his advocates continued reminding SCC and \nclassification officials, including through letters and emails to Classification Defendants White, \nEnloe, and Echessa, that the screwdriver charges had been manufactured, and that even if they \nignored that information, the assault case had been downgraded to attempt and the possession of \nweapon charge eventually dropped altogether.  Yet, despite considerable time passing since these \ncases, and despite Mr. Hope and his advocates recounting the questionable nature of the charges, \n20 Id.\n21 Id.\n37\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 45 of 80 PageID #:\n657\nthe screwdriver incident continued being raised at SCC review hearings and by the Classification \nDefendants in their responses to Mr. Hopeโs advocatesโ inquiries.\nC. Classification Defendant Bennett Joined The Classification Defendantsโ \nAgreement To Keep Mr. Hope In Solitary \n113. Classification Defendant Bennett began appearing as an SCC member at Mr. \nHopeโs review hearings in 2015 and 2016.  At Mr. Hopeโs first review hearing before her, Ms. \nBennett allowed Mr. Hope to make a statement and seemed to actually listen to his concerns as he \nrecounted his experiences in segregation, including the unsanitary cells he was being shuffled \nbetween and the effects being exacted on his physical and mental health.  Ms. Bennett told Mr. \nHope she found no reason not to release him to G.P.  She explained to a grateful Mr. Hope that \nshe would place him in a transition program on his way to G.P.  After Ms. Bennett went back to \nher office in Huntsville, where she worked with the other Classification Defendants, however, Mr. \nHopeโs SCC Review Hearing Record was filled out to show that rather than be released to a \ntransition program, Mr. Hope was to remain in solitary.  No one bothered to communicate this \nchange to Mr. Hope directly and he learned of the switch three weeks later when he received the \nform.  At his next review hearing before Classification Defendant and then-SCC member Bennett, \nMr. Hope asked Ms. Bennett why he had not been sent to the transition program.  This time, Ms. \nBennett repeated the party line to Mr. Hope: she was told she did not have the authority to release \nMr. Hope from solitary. \n114. Classification Defendant Bennett was the first person to tell Mr. Hope that he was \nโhigh profileโ so could only be released by the CID Director or Deputy Director.  Around this \ntime, Mr. Hope began hearing from several other SCC members and Classification Defendants \nthat he could not be released because of a โhigh profileโ status, which SCC member Armstrong \nclaimed was reflected by a โHX Proโ abbreviation on the last page of Mr. Hopeโs SCC file \n38\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 46 of 80 PageID #:\n658\n(although was not reflected on the SCC Review Hearing Records Mr. Hope received after \nhearings).  It remains unclear to Mr. Hope what a โhigh profileโ status means, how someone \nacquires such a status, or what one can do to challenge the status or have it removed from their \nfile.  As a practical matter, the โhigh profileโ status again made Mr. Hopeโs SCC review hearings \nentirely meaningless.  And to the extent this โhigh profileโ status may be tied to his decades-old \nescape  and  resulted  in  Mr.  Hopeโs  continued  segregation,  such  segregation  was  grossly \ndisproportionate punishment.  To the extent his โhigh profileโ status may be tied to his advocacy \nand outreachโwhich is protected activityโthe designation in itself is unlawful retaliation.\n115. As he did on other occasions, Mr. Hope filed a grievance stating that because Ms. \nBennett conducted his review hearing but lacked (or claimed to lack) authority to actually release \nhim from solitary, his review was meaningless.  Polunsky Defendant Harris denied this grievance.\nVII. MR.  HOPE  ENDURED  MEANINGLESS  REVIEWS  WHILE  THE \nCLASSIFICATION DEFENDANTS SHIFTED ATTENTION TO OTHERS\n116. This pattern of the Classification Defendants and their subordinates pointing Mr. \nHope and his advocates in other directions to find someone responsible for releasing him from \nsegregation continued for years.\n117. In or about June 2017, Classification Defendant Enloe, SCC Chair at the time, \nconducted  Mr.  Hopeโs  SCC  review  hearing,  joined  by  Polunsky  Defendant  Rehse.    The \ncircumstances were unusual.  SCC chairs rarely conducted review hearingsโthe chair typically \nremained in Huntsville and did not travel to the units for hearings.  Despite being SCC Chair, \nthough, Ms. Enloe claimed it was not her decision whether to release Mr. Hope to G.P.\n118. Mr. Hope asked why she was reviewing him if she lacked authority to decide the \nvery issue the review hearing was held to decide.  Ms. Enloe said she was asked to make the trip \nto Polunsky by her superior (and co-conspirator), Classification Defendant White, and had agreed \n39\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 47 of 80 PageID #:\n659\nto deliver a message on Ms. Whiteโs behalf to Mr. Hope that, in sum or substance, his having \npeople contact the SCC or classification officials for him would โnot do him any good.โ  Ms. Enloe \noccasionally appeared at subsequent review hearings for Mr. Hope as well, always at the same \ntime as when Mr. Hope and his advocates were most active in speaking out about his mistreatment \nand the poor conditions of his confinement.\n119. Polunsky Defendant Rehseโs presence at this June 2017 SCC review hearing gave \nClassification Defendant Enloe the opportunity to speak with Mr. Rehse about Mr. Hope, including \nin private conversations before Mr. Hope arrived and after he left the hearing.  \n120. The repeated denials did not deter Mr. Hope or his supporters from advocating for \nhim.  For example, in 2017, supporters wrote multiple letters to classification officials including \nClassification Defendant White, urging the SCC to reconsider its past decisions. \nA. Polunsky Defendant Rehse Agreed To Continue Mr. Hopeโs Frequent \nMoves, Now Into Worsening Conditions\n121. In addition to being when Polunsky Defendant Rehse started joining Mr. Hopeโs \nSCC review hearings, 2017 was also the year when Mr. Hope noticed Mr. Rehseโs name on the \nforms authorizing multiple of his cell moves.  Mr. Hope thought it might help if he spoke with Mr. \nRehse, so in mid-to-late 2017, Mr. Hope asked Mr. Rehse why he was moved so frequently.  Mr. \nRehse acknowledged he was involved in Mr. Hopeโs cell moves and that, in sum or in substance, \nโthey started it and Iโm not about to end it.โ\n122. The more Mr. Hope was shuffled between cells, the more officers remarked how \npointless the moves were: someone ranking above the officers (often Polunsky Defendant Rehse) \nrequested and authorized the moves so they were bound to carry them out but complained that \nmoving Mr. Hope so often wasted time and created extra work, such as when they had to search \nfor Mr. Hope to deliver his mail.  Yet the frequent moves continued.\n40\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 48 of 80 PageID #:\n660\n123. The cell moves continued to expose Mr. Hope to unsafe and unsanitary conditions.  \nOne three-week period in or around late 2017 illustrates the extent of these inhospitable conditions.  \nDuring this short period, Polunsky Defendant Rehse authorized Mr. Hopeโs placement in at least \nfive different cells containing mold.  In one cell, the problem was so severe that, upon entering, \nMr. Hope thought a previous occupant had set the wall on fire.  He later realized that what he \nthought was a charred wall was, in fact, a thick layer of black mold.  Mr. Hope showed the mold-\ncovered wall to Polunsky Defendant Rehse and others, but no corrective measures were takenโ\nMr. Hope was even denied proper cleaning supplies.  Mr. Hope filed a grievance but that too was \ndenied.  Eventually, Mr. Hope asked an advocate to contact the unit.  The advocate managed to \ntalk to Warden Jefferson, who ordered Mr. Hope be moved to a different cell without mold.\n124. Still, the problem persisted.  For example, in or around October 2018, Mr. Hope \nwas moved into yet another moldy cellโthis time with black mold in the corners, the base of the \nwall, and near the ceiling, and with standing water pooled across the floor.  Like he had done on \nother occasions, Mr. Hope reported the issue, this time to Officer Palmer, who informed Mr. Hope \nthat officials already knew this cell was contaminated with mold before they had Mr. Hope moved \ninto it.  Mr. Hope reported the mold (and its effect on his breathing) directly to at least seven staff \nmembers ranked under Polunsky Defendant Rehse, but each refused to move Mr. Hope to a clean \ncell.  Instead, Mr. Hope was left in this cell much longer than others and forced to wait two months \nbefore staff initiated a maintenance work order, which also failed to remove the mold.  Frequent \nmold exposure caused and exacerbated Mr. Hopeโs respiratory issues, including as demonstrated \nby Mr. Hopeโs medical evaluation in or around November 2018.  Despite the dangers these \nconditions presented to Mr. Hopeโs physical and mental health, and despite his pleas for correction, \nMr. Hope was left in squalor.  Mr. Hope saw Polunsky Defendant Harris, then Senior Warden, \n41\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 49 of 80 PageID #:\n661\nseveral times during this period.  Mr. Harris needed no introduction as he already knew who Mr. \nHope was.  When Mr. Hope asked about his frequent moves into unsafe cells, Mr. Harris indicated \nhe would not intervene to stop it.\n125. While Polunsky Defendant Rehse was the Major over Polunskyโs segregation unit, \nMr. Hope was also exposed to other unsafe conditions, including chemical agents despite having \ndone nothing warranting deployment.  This exposure occurred multiple times, including at least \ntwice in 2017, when Mr. Rehse ordered officers to keep exhaust fans off and not to ventilate or \nclean after chemical agents had been deployed in close proximity to, but not because of, Mr. Hope.\n126. The regular cell moves, enacted first by Mr. McMullen and continued by Mr. \nRehse, have caused physical and psychological harm to Mr. Hope.  The coordinated attack on Mr. \nHope through his living conditions left Mr. Hope constantly disoriented and perpetually unsafe.  \nMr. Hope was forced to remain on high alert as he tried to adjust to different surroundings, with \ncountless new noises from new neighborsโwhile also bracing himself against a constant threat of \nretaliation.  Mr. Hope developed persistent insomnia, routinely sleeping only several hours per \nnight, and often in interrupted spurts, including because officers sometimes moved him between \ncells in the middle of the night.  Additionally, these frequent moves caused delays to Mr. Hopeโs \nmail, which impeded his ability to correspond with officials, his advocates, and media members.  \nOn at least one occasion, official paperwork from the SCC was not properly delivered to Mr. Hope.\n127. While any move is inherently stressful, here, the damage was only magnified by \nthe frequency with which Mr. Hope was moved and the conditions he was forced into, as well as \nthe effects of his long-term isolation without meaningful access to mental health care.  Mr. Hope \nhad no agency to get himself out of segregation, and no agency over his conditions within \nsegregation.  Due to the frequent cell moves, Mr. Hope suffered, and continues to suffer, from \n42\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 50 of 80 PageID #:\n662\nanxiety, depression, obsessive compulsions, diminished ability to concentrate, confusion, memory \nloss, paranoia, thoughts of self-harm, and insomnia, and conditions such as hypertension (high \nblood pressure) were exacerbated.\n128. Being constantly shuffled to new cells caused Mr. Hope harm and frequently \nexposed him to physically unsafe conditions.  Mr. Hope was regularly moved into cells that were \nin disrepair or were so unsanitary as to be unfit for human occupancy.  Polunsky Defendants Rehse \nand Harris, as well as the Classification Defendants, knew of these conditionsโbecause Mr. Hope \npersonally showed or told each of themโbut disregarded the risks posed:  Mr. Rehse continued \nauthorizing cell moves, Mr. Harris ignored Mr. Hopeโs expressed concerns about his health, and \nthe Classification Defendants continued finding excuses to justify his indefinite placement in \nsegregation.  Further, each of the Classification Defendants knew of the inhumane conditions of \nMr. Hopeโs confinement and the effect it was having on Mr. Hope.  Instead of taking steps to have \nthose conditions corrected or to have Mr. Hope released from segregation, the Classification \nDefendants continued rubber stamping his placement in disregard of the risks to Mr. Hope.\n129. Despite Defendantsโ design and agreement to frustrate his ability to do so, Mr. Hope \nfiled grievances related to the aforementioned cell moves, thereby exhausting available remedies.\nB. Polunsky Defendant Rehse Participated In Further SCC Review Hearings\n130. Polunsky Defendant Rehse was present at Mr. Hopeโs next review hearing in or \naround December 2017, this time with Classification Defendant Fiveash and Amanda Maddox \n(who had also been part of the team that collected the planted screwdriver in February 2012, and \nthat gassed Mr. Hope with chemical agents and then left him naked and exposed for days in the \naftermath).  This review hearing, like others, was over quickly.  Ms. Fiveash told Mr. Hope she \nlacked authority to release him.  Mr. Hope asked if and how he could speak to someone with the \nauthority to release him.  Ms. Fiveash indicated that only the Director of TDCJ could release Mr. \n43\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 51 of 80 PageID #:\n663\nHope to G.P., and although Mr. Hope would have to speak to someone outside the SCC to get \nreleased, the SCC would see him again in six months.  Mr. Rehse remarked to Mr. Hope, in sum \nor in substance, that Mr. Hope was his own worst enemy, indicating that his treatment was tied to \nMr. Hopeโs continued advocacy efforts.\n131. Polunsky Defendant Rehse joined a third consecutive SCC review hearing in or \naround June 2018 with another SCC member.  Outside of his review hearings, Mr. Hope asked \nMr. Rehse what he thought it would take for Mr. Hope to be released to G.P., only to have Mr. \nRehse respond that he didnโt believe Mr. Hope would ever be released from segregation. \nVIII. SCC MEMBERS REVEALED MR. HOPEโS HEARINGS WERE MERE \nโWELFARE CHECKS,โ NOT DESIGNED FOR MEANINGFUL REVIEW\n132. As time wore on, classification and TDCJ officials continued to provide Mr. Hope \nwith conflicting information.  On or about August 11, 2017, in response to a grievance, Assistant \nRegional Director Matt Gross told Mr. Hope that โThe State Classification Committee can make \nthe decision to release an offender from Administrative Segregation; however, if an offender has \nan escape on file, justification must be forwarded to the Chairman of Classification for approval.  \nYou have been reviewed by a special administrative committee for offenders who have been \nclassified to Administrative Segregation for over 15 years.โ  Mr. Hope had heard reference to an \nadministrative committee once beforeโin or around January 2013, when SCC member Bilnoski \ntold Mr. Hope that because the committee had reviewed his file, Mr. Bilnoski could not make an \nindependent decisionโbut no one had raised it since despite Mr. Hopeโs continued questions.  One \nof Mr. Hopeโs advocates called TDCJ and learned that Classification Defendant Echessa was the \ncommitteeโs head.\n133. Although Mr. Echessa agreed he had the authority to make a release decision on \nhis own, he insisted that he would not get involved unless he received a request or recommendation \n44\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 52 of 80 PageID #:\n664\nfrom  classification  first  (which  contradicted  information  from  other  of  the  Classification \nDefendants  and  the  examples  where  committee  members  recommended  that  Mr.  Hope  be \nreleased).  To further confuse matters, also in August 2017, Mr. Hope received a letter from \nClassification Defendant Enloe stating that no special review process applied to Mr. Hope and he \nwould be evaluated again at his next regular SCC review hearing.  In short, it was entirely unclear \nto Mr. Hope whether an SCC member could authorize his release from segregation at a review \nhearing or whether he was subject to some modified review procedure and, if so, what that \nprocedure was based onโhis former escape, the purported โunusual and difficultโ nature of his \ncircumstances, his โhigh profileโ status, or the length of time he had been in solitary confinement.\n134. In or around December 2018, at an SCC review hearing, Mr. Hope was told by SCC \nmember Armstrong that a group of TDCJ directors had reviewed Mr. Hopeโs file years earlier and \nhad not released him to G.P., that Mr. Hope had not been reviewed for release in the years since, \nand that Mr. Armstrong too felt he lacked authority to do so.  Instead, Mr. Armstrong indicated \nthat Mr. Hopeโs previous escape in his record meant he would remain in segregation for the entirety \nof his sentence.  Assistant Warden Perez, who was also present, seemed to agree, stating that the \nSCC will not release to G.P. anyone who had escaped before.  SCC member Thompson similarly \ntold Mr. Hope she did not have the authority to release him from segregation because of his \nprevious escape.  At Mr. Hopeโs review hearing in or around December 2019, SCC member \nTrevino went further, reporting to Mr. Hope that his SCC hearings were mere โwelfare checksโ \nbecause TDCJ directors reviewed his case only once every 10 years.\n135. As he had done for years, Mr. Hope filed grievances regarding these hearings and \nthe lack of meaningful review available to him.  He and his advocates sent additional letters to the \nClassification Defendants and others outlining their concerns with what Mr. Hope was told at \n45\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 53 of 80 PageID #:\n665\nreview hearings and pleading for someone with authority to actually review him for release from \nsegregation.  Mr. Hope survived these unconstitutional conditions of confinement and continued \nto advocate for himself, in the face of sham proceedings and retaliation, for nearly three decades.\nIX. MR. HOPE WAS RELEASED FROM SOLITARY BUT EXPERIENCED \nFURTHER MISTREATMENT\nA. Mr. Hope Was Released From Solitary In 2022 Because Of The Supreme \nCourtโs Impending Review Of His Claims In This Case\n136. After 27 years in solitary confinement, Mr. Hope was finally released to G.P. on or \nabout February 7, 2022โone week after, and seemingly because, he filed a Petition for Writ of \nCertiorari with the United States Supreme Court to challenge dismissal of his Eighth Amendment \nand other claims in this case.  See Hope v. Harris, No. 20-40379, Dkt. No. 3 (U.S. Jan. 28, 2021).\n137. Mr. Hope originally filed this case in February 2018, seeking both injunctive relief \nand damages.  Dkt. No. 1; see also Dkt. No. 15.  Following decisions on a motion to dismiss, Dkt. \nNo. 28, and an appeal to the Fifth Circuit, Hope v. Harris, 861 F. Appโx 571 (5th Cir. 2021), Mr. \nHope  sought  certiorari  regarding  whether  prolonged  solitary  confinement  can,  under  some \ncircumstances, violate the Eighth Amendment, a question on which there is a longstanding circuit \nsplit, and whether defendants violated his right to procedural due process.  Hope v. Harris, No. \n20-40379, Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Dkt. No. 3 at i (U.S. Jan. 28, 2021).\n138. Seemingly to avoid the Supreme Courtโs review of his case, Mr. Hope was finally \nreleased from solitary confinement on February 7, 2022.  The Polunsky and Classification \nDefendants then argued that his eleventh-hour release mooted his claims for injunctive relief.22  \n22 Mr. Hope reserves the right to pursue injunctive relief if he is again placed in segregation.  To \ndate, Mr. Hope has already been re-placed in solitary on two separate occasions, both in November \n2022 for a total of approximately five days, while at the Estelle Medical Facility for an eye exam.  \nNeither was pursuant to proper procedure. \n46\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 54 of 80 PageID #:\n666\nHope v. Harris, No. 20-40379, Response to Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Dkt. No. 13 at 12โ13 \n(U.S. May 9, 2022).\n139. At the time of his release from solitary, no explanation was provided to Mr. Hope \nabout why he was suddenly being released to G.P., or on whose authority, after so many years of \nhaving his self-advocacy go entirely unnoticed.  Indeed, his most recent SCC review hearing had \nbeen on or about January 6, 2022, just a month before his release.  Although he had the rights to \nattend and to make or submit statements at SCC review hearings, Mr. Hope was told he was not \npermitted to attend this January review hearing due to COVID-19, and he had not received enough \nadvance notice to be able to mail a statement to the SCC for consideration.  Mr. Hopeโs release to \nG.P. was again denied at this January 2022 review hearing.\n140. On May 4, 2022, now-Director of Classifications Timothy Fitzpatrick provided a \ndeclaration as part of Defendantsโ briefing to the United States Supreme Court.  There, Mr. \nFitzpatrick claimed that โ[o]n Feb. 4, 2022, the State Classification Committee held a hearing to \nconsider Dennis Wayne Hopeโs . . . continued classification in Restrictive Housing. . . . The \nCommittee reached this decision [to release him to G.P.] after extensive consideration of all prior \ncriminogenic  history,  institutional  adjustment,  the  recommendation  of  Polunsky  Unit \nAdministration concerning current behavior, and in consultation with the leadership of TDCJ.โ  \nHope v. Harris, No. 20-40379, Suggestion of Mootness and Brief in Opp., app., Dkt. No. 21-1065 \nat 1a-3a (U.S. May 4, 2022).  This declaration was the first time Mr. Hope had heard about this \nalleged  irregularly  scheduled  review  hearing,  purportedly  conducted  while  Classification \nDefendant Bennett was SCC Chair.  Mr. Hope had not received notice prior to the review hearing, \nwas not given an opportunity to attend or present statements, and still to this day has not received \na written record of the decision.\n47\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 55 of 80 PageID #:\n667\n141. In the 27 years preceding his release from solitary, Mr. Hope never had SCC review \nhearings in back-to-back months.  The closest irregularity was the July 2007 review hearing where \nMs. Jones claimed the SCC had no record of the April 2007 review hearing at which Mr. Rogers \nfirst decided to release Mr. Hope to G.P.  The unprecedented timing further calls into question the \nmotive for this impromptu February 2022 review hearing outside of Mr. Hopeโs presence.\nB. Mr. Hope Transitioned To Ellis Unit, And Was Met With Ellis Defendants \nSimmonsโ and Clarkโs Excessive Use Of Force\n142. In February 2022, Mr. Hope was transferred from solitary to a transition program \nat the Ellis Unit in Huntsville, Texasโwhere the SCC is also headquartered.  While there, Ellis \nDefendants Simmons and Clark used excessive force to injure Mr. Hope, only relenting when \nhospital medical staff and an Ellis warden stepped in with corrective action.\n143. From Mr. Hopeโs first day at Ellis, it was clear that SCC and classification officials \nwere unhappy with his release from solitary, and they let the Ellis Unit staff know it.  Classification \nDefendant and now-SCC Chair Bennett and Director of Classification Fitzpatrick came to Ellis to \ndeliver an ominous message in front of Mr. Hopeโs new housing section and staff: Mr. Fitzpatrick \nhad a long career in front of him and would โrememberโ Mr. Hope.  Mr. Hope never had a cell \nmate while at Ellis despite double-celling being standard, and heard this decision was made at the \ndirection of Classification Defendant Bennett, who dictated that Mr. Hope must be housed alone.\n144. While at Ellis, Mr. Hope participated in a cognitive intervention program that \nincluded a journaling component.  Mr. Hope wrote in his journal about his time in solitary, \nmistreatment he had experienced, and wanting to effect change in how other prisoners in solitary \nare treated.  Mr. Hope shared this entry in front of the class and instructor in May 2022.  Although \nhe did not know it at the time, Mr. Hope would never see his journal again.\n48\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 56 of 80 PageID #:\n668\n145. On or about May 22, 2022, Mr. Hope experienced respiratory distress and reported \nsevere difficulty breathing.  When evaluated, on-site medical providers requested an immediate \nemergency medical transport to Huntsville Memorial Hospital.  Ellis Defendant Simmons and \nSergeant Schwartz were responsible for preparing Mr. Hope for transport.  Mr. Schwartz first \nplaced restraints on Mr. Hope, leaving the appropriate one-finger width of space between the \nhandcuffs and Mr. Hopeโs wrists.  Then, without justification and despite Mr. Hopeโs emergency \nmedical needs, Ellis Defendant Simmons re-fastened the handcuffs, clamping them so tightly that \nthe metal bit into Mr. Hopeโs wrists.  Ms. Simmons then told Mr. Hope to โget used to it.โ  During \nthe ambulance ride to the hospital, Mr. Hopeโs wrists and hands began going numb due to the \ntightness of the handcuffs.\n146. At the hospital, Ellis Defendant Clark met the ambulance and escorted Mr. Hope to \na treatment bed.  A nurse saw Mr. Hopeโs now-purple hands and asked Mr. Clark why the restraints \nwere so tight.  Mr. Clark responded, in sum or substance, โitโs like that for a reason.โ  The nurse \ntold Mr. Clark that the overly tightened cuffs were causing Mr. Hope to lose circulation to his \nhands, but Mr. Clark merely repeated that he had a reason.\n147. At Mr. Hopeโs treatment bed in the emergency room, a different nurse asked Ellis \nDefendant Clark why Mr. Hopeโs handcuffs were so tight that his hands were discolored and \nswollen.  This nurse received the same vague explanation that there was a reason.  Unsatisfied, the \nnurse pressed for the reason, but was shut down by Mr. Clarkโs response, in sum or in substance: \nโyou handle the medical, weโll handle the security.โ  Throughout that day and evening, Mr. Hope \ncomplained of severe pain in his wrists to no avail.  His hands grew more swollen and purple. \n148. Mr. Hope was diagnosed with pneumonia.  The next afternoon, a doctor came to \nMr. Hopeโs hospital room.  Almost immediately, the doctor saw Mr. Hopeโs wrists and hands and \n49\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 57 of 80 PageID #:\n669\nleft to speak with Captain Flores just outside Mr. Hopeโs room.  Captain Flores called her \nsupervisor, the warden at the Byrd Unit, who instructed her to call Ellis Warden Kelly Strong.  \nWarden Strong instructed Captain Flores to apply the handcuffs according to policy, meaning to \nloosen them until there was one fingerโs width of space between each handcuff and wrist. \n149. The damage had already been done, and Mr. Hope experienced significant pain in \nhis wrists and hands throughout his week in the hospital.  Nurses had to continually bandage Mr. \nHopeโs wrists due to the damage inflicted by Ellis Defendants Simmons and Clark.  Since this \nincident, Mr. Hope experiences periods of numbness in his hands, most severely around the base \nof his right thumb.23  The pain flares up anytime he is required to wear restraints, which he must \nwhenever he is transported for medical care offsite.\n150. Mr. Hope filed grievances related to the aforementioned use of excessive force, \nthereby exhausting available remedies.\n151. After his time at Ellis, Mr. Hope was transferred to the Connally Unit, and he \ncurrently remains housed there.  \nX. DEFENDANTSโ ACTIONS RESULTED IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HARM \nTO MR. HOPE\n152. Mr. Hopeโs physical and mental health have deteriorated after spending half of his \nlife in isolation, much longer than any security purpose required, and frequently in inhumane \nconditions unfit for human habitation.  He has tried to stave off the effects of solitary as much as \npossible.  For example, Mr. Hope noticed his vocabulary diminishing, so he tried to focus on \nspeech patterns in radio programming.  Ultimately, he believes even with his efforts that his \nphysical ability to speak and cognitive ability to converse have deteriorated.\n23 Indeed, Mr. Hope was diagnosed with paresthesia (numbness) in his right thumb when seen by \nmedical staff at the Connally Unit months later.\n50\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 58 of 80 PageID #:\n670\n153. In some instances, Defendantsโ acts compounded the effects of solitary.  For \nexample, Mr. Hopeโs eyesight has declined, in part due to regular factors such as age, but also in \npart because Defendants repeatedly moved him into cells with no or few working lights, leaving \nhim to strain through darkness to write, read, or even see his food to eat.\n154. Examples of other harms include, but are not limited to, the following:\nA. Respiratory Issues\n155. Mr. Hope suffered from upper respiratory issues as a result of his repeated and \nintentional exposure to mold.  Living in squalor in cells that had not been cleaned prior to staff \nmoving Mr. Hope into them, and often with only minimal or no proper cleaning supplies available \nto him, exposed Mr. Hope to mold unnecessarily.  These conditions continued even after Mr. Hope \nmade these issues known, causing still further health issues.\nB. Lower Back, Shoulder, and Knee Pain\n156. Mr. Hope suffers from chronic, burning lower back and leg pain exacerbated by \nyears spent in a cramped space with minimal opportunities for recreation.  Although staff initially \nallowed Mr. Hope a brace to support his back, a doctor rescinded that order in the early 2000s, \ninstead finding that Mr. Hope needed exercise and physical therapy to strengthen his back.  But \nwithout the back brace and without proper exercise and therapy, Mr. Hopeโs back pain increased.  \nDespite past orders for physical therapy and an MRI, TDCJ provided only ibuprofen, which \ncontinued to be the primary method of treatment for years to come.\n157. By early 2023, Mr. Hopeโs daily life had become undeniably restricted by his back \npain, which by then was worsening into his hip.  Mr. Hopeโs complaints led a health care provider \nto order an MRI and look into additional and alternative methods of care.  Mr. Hopeโs MRI \nrevealed multilevel degenerative changes in his spine, for which a doctor ordered physical therapy \nin or around August 2023 (although Mr. Hope has not yet had a physical therapy session to date).  \n51\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 59 of 80 PageID #:\n671\nWhile this physical therapy is vital for improving Mr. Hopeโs quality of life, the transportation to \nand from his physical therapy sessions requires 12 hours of being handcuffed in the transport \nvehicleโadditional exposure to hardship that could have been avoided if addressed sooner.\n158. Mr. Hope contends with shoulder and knee pain arising from his extended time in \nsolitary confinement.  There, Mr. Hope had to be handcuffed to leave his cell.  While this restraint \nwas imposed for regular activities, it was also imposed during the hundreds of times Mr. Hope was \nmoved to a new cell with no apparent security purpose, as well as the numerous times he was \ncuffed because he was kept in solitary after he was no longer an escape risk and after the SCC first \ndecided he could be released to G.P. in 2007.  To be handcuffed, Mr. Hope had to crouch down, \nface  the  back  of  his  cell,  and  extend  his  wrists  behind  him  towards  the  slot  in  his  door \napproximately two feet off the ground.  Repeatedly assuming this unnatural position placed \nenormous strain on Mr. Hopeโs shoulder and knees, leading to persistent pain.  In or around \nDecember 2020, Mr. Hope received a steroid shot in his left shoulder, which helped, but he was \nprevented by prison staff from regularly receiving that treatment.  \nC. Insomnia\n159. Mr. Hope began suffering from intense nightmares and then insomnia when he was \nhoused with death row inmates at Polunsky starting in 2007.  In his nightmares, TDCJ officials \nmixed him up with death row prisoners and came to take him to his execution.  Over time, his \nsleeplessness worsened to the point where he was lucky to get even four hours of interrupted sleep \nin a night.  The conditions of solitary only made matters worse: At virtually all times of the day \nand night, other prisoners would bang on doors, talk to themselves, or yell or urinate through their \ncells.  Guards came and went at all hours, causing gates to bang and slam.  Self-harm and suicide \nattempts are, sadly, prevalent in solitary confinement, causing further disruptions.  These factors \nwere compounded by the frequent cell moves, which could and sometimes did occur in the middle \n52\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 60 of 80 PageID #:\n672\nof the night, and that left him constantly disoriented, making the new noises and voices impossible \nto ignore.  Throughout the years there were many nights when he was unable to sleep at all.  To \nthis day, Mr. Hope continues to suffer from insomnia.   \nD. Other Psychological Harm\n160. Mr. Hope suffered significant psychological harms attributable to Defendantsโ \nactions (or inactions as the case may be).  Mr. Hope has experienced, for example, lasting anxiety, \ndepression, obsessive compulsions, suicidal ideations, and emotional numbness.  In or around late \n2014, Mr. Hope began experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations.24  At times, Mr. Hope has \nresorted to biting his own arm to remind himself he was alive.  \n161. Some of Mr. Hopeโs psychological harm is unsurprising, as the debilitating effects \nof solitary confinement are well-established and widely recognized.  For example, scholars have \nrepeatedly documented symptoms from solitary confinement to include โsevere anxiety or panic \ndisorder, disordered thinking including paranoia, compulsive activities including pacing and \nrepeatedly cleaning the cell, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, agitation, irritability, \nhyperawareness, strong startle reaction, mounting irrational anger, impairment of judgement, \ndespair and suicidal inclinations.โ25  Likewise, researchers have documented how such symptoms \n24 When Mr. Hope raised his concerns with mental health staffโhoping they could offer some \ninsight or understandingโthey offered only medication, which Mr. Hope declined, fearing the \nside effects of heavy psychotropic drugs.\n25 Terry A. Kupers, Supermax Prison Isolation in Pre-Crime Society, in THE PRE-CRIME SOCIETY \n293-94 (Bruce Arrigo & Brian Sellers eds., 2021).\n53\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 61 of 80 PageID #:\n673\ncan be long-lasting, all the way up to increased risk of death,26 and sufficient to constitute a SHU \nPost-Release Syndrome.27\n162. Indeed, in 2014, Lance Lowry, the president of AFSCME Local 3807, the union \nrepresenting Texas correctional employees, called for regulation to limit solitary confinement \nbecause of the effects: โ[r]esearch shows that depriving inmates of human contact for long periods \nof time may exacerbate mental crisis, assaultive behavior, antisocial behaviors, and acute health \ndisorders.  Psychological effects due to lack of sensory stimulation can include anxiety, depression, \nanger,  cognitive  disturbances,  perceptual  distortions,  obsessive  thoughts,  paranoia,  and \npsychosis.โ28\n163. Defendants  compounded  these  effects  as  Mr.  Hope  remained  in  solitary  for \nadditional years and was subjected to traumatic incidents and inhumane conditions.  For example, \nand in addition to other examples noted in previous sections:\n๏ท In 2007, while housed with those on death row, Mr. Hope started to experience \na sense of suspended animation and despair that has come to be known as \nโDeath Row Syndrome.โ  His neighbors were sentenced to death, and he felt at \nthe same time deeply affected yet also unmoved by their deaths.  Even after \nthen-Texas Senator Whitmire intervened on Mr. Hopeโs behalf to have him \nmoved off of death row, Mr. Hope still felt haunted by the experience.  Death \n26 Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, Josie Sivaraman, David L. Rosen, Association of Restrictive \nHousing During Incarceration With Mortality After Release, 2 JAMA OPEN NETWORK 19 (Oct. 4, \n2019).\n27 Terry A. Kupers, The SHU Post-Release Syndrome: A Preliminary Report, 14 CORRECTIONAL \nMENTAL HEALTH REP. 6, 81 (Mar./Apr. 2016). \n28 Statement of Lance L. Lowry, AFSCME Texas Correctional Employees Local 3807 (Feb. 25, \n2014), https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lance-Lowry-Senate-Hearing-\nSubmission.pdf. \n54\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 62 of 80 PageID #:\n674\nrow prisoners would still be walked by Mr. Hopeโs cell on their way to being \nexecuted.  Mr. Hope would be overwhelmed by despair, comparing his own \nlack of hope to theirs. He projected their fate onto his own experience of slow \ndeath by the state.\n๏ท Frequent cell moves triggered obsessive compulsions for Mr. Hope.  Moving \nso often required him to prioritize his belongings so he could more quickly pack \nand unpack them with each new cell.  Mr. Hope began to feel as if he were \nliving in a puzzle, and if any one thing were out of place, it caused him immense \ndistress.  He became so familiar with his small inventory of belongings that, for \nexample, he was able to identify when address pages were confiscated from his \nnotebook but not properly recorded on property forms.  \n๏ท To this day, Mr. Hope panics when he sees discoloring or spots on the walls.  \nBecause of his many, many cell moves, in particular to cells covered in mold, \nMr. Hope was constantly disoriented and on high alert for additional signs of \nmold or other health hazards.  Mr. Hope would even question if spots on the \nwall were real.  It was an unsettling feeling, as all the cells looked the same, and \nhe had been in so many that were alike, save for small differences like a chip in \nthe paint or discoloration of the floor, and he began to, and continues to, fixate \non such differences.  \n๏ท Even now in G.P., certain scenarios continue to trigger Mr. Hope, causing \nsignificant distress and conjuring traumatic memories.\n164. During Mr. Hopeโs time in solitary, he was denied meaningful mental health care.  \nMr. Hope wanted to work through years of trauma from his time at Polunsky rather than be overly \n55\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 63 of 80 PageID #:\n675\nmedicated, which seemed common around him.  But he was denied enrollment in a mental health \ndiversion program because he refused heavy-duty psychiatric medications, as was his right, and \nseemingly also because of the ambiguous โhigh profileโ designation that still has not been \nexplained to him.  Still, Mr. Hope expressed concerns about his mental health, including in letters \nas well as a grievance, which Defendant Harris denied, writing that no action was warranted.  \n165. Mr. Hopeโs mental health crises required serious attention and could not be fixed \nwith a simple prescription. In 2021, Mr. Hope wrote a note that epitomized his struggle: โI have \nnow been in this cell 33 days without recreation.  I have been in isolation for over 26 years.  My \ndepression has gotten worse . . . [and] my bouts with anxiety are daily . . . . There are times I am \nhearing voices and seeing things that arenโt there. . . .  I need to talk to someone about how to \nmanage these things.โ  In response, Mr. Hope was โseen cell sideโ but medical staff merely \nsuggested he keep himself occupied as a distraction.\n166. Even after Mr. Hopeโs release to G.P., he continues to suffer the physical and \nmental effects of Defendantsโ mistreatment over his decades of isolation.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nCruel and Unusual Punishment Under the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\nBased on Conditions of Solitary Confinement\n(Polunsky Defendants and Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n167.  Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as though fully set forth herein.\n168. The Eighth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, prohibits โcruel \nand unusual punishments.โ  U.S. Const. amend. VIII.  In its prohibition on such punishments, the \nEighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement.  See, \ne.g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).  Conditions of confinement within a prison \nviolate the Eighth Amendment when (1) the conditions, either alone or in combination, pose a \n56\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 64 of 80 PageID #:\n676\nsufficiently serious threat to a prisonerโs health or safety, such that a prisoner is deprived of the \nminimal measure of lifeโs necessities and (2) prison officials act with deliberate indifference to the \nthreat.  Id. at 834; see also Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 304 (1991).\n169. Solitary confinement is a form of punishment that implicates Eighth Amendment \nconcerns when paired with other intolerable conditions.  Although not dispositive, the length of \ntime in solitary confinement โcannot be ignoredโ in deciding whether conditions of confinement \nmeet constitutional standards.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686-87 (1978).\n170. Forcing Mr. Hope to live alone for 27 years in unsanitary environments and, at \ntimes, without even minimum necessities (e.g., a blanket in February, a single set of clothing, a \ndry cell, etc.) constituted serious deprivations of the basic needs for safe and sanitary living \nconditions, for hygiene, for sleep and healthcare, and for meaningful human interaction, among \nothers.  Such deprivations were worsened by the extreme length of time Mr. Hope spent in \ninhumane conditions in solitary confinement and by the excessive number of cell moves.  \n171. Beginning in 2007, when Mr. Hope was first housed in solitary confinement at \nPolunsky, and especially after 2012 when Mr. Hope was moved to over 260 different cells, Mr. \nHope was repeatedly housed in deplorable conditions and routinely exposed to urine, feces, vomit, \nrats, roaches, and mold, without the ability to properly disinfect and clean his cells.  As a few \nexamples of the many inhospitable or dangerous cells Mr. Hope was confined in, one cellโs wall \nwas so covered with mold that Mr. Hope initially thought the wall was charred, another had no \nworking lights, and still others exposed Mr. Hope to extreme temperatures or leaked water when \nit rained.  No prisoner should experience these conditions, yet Mr. Hope was forced to endure these \nconditions while simultaneously being deprived of the ability to participate in prison programming, \nwork a job, and participate in the meaningful human interaction that is a part of G.P.  Worse still, \n57\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 65 of 80 PageID #:\n677\nand again unlike what he would have experienced if housed in G.P., Mr. Hope had no way to \nescape the unsanitary conditions present in many of his tiny cells because he was confined to his \ncell for almost every minute of every day.\n172. Mr. Hopeโs physical and mental health declined.  Mr. Hope frequently became ill \nfrom exposure to mold, filth, and cold.  He experienced, among other ailments, depression, \nhopelessness, despair, suicidal ideation, and hallucinations.  He began to suffer, and still suffers, \nfrom chronic insomnia.  Mr. Hope developed lasting, chronic back pain exacerbated by years of \nrestricted movement and protracted shoulder and knee pain due to being repeatedly handcuffed \nthrough his cell door at an unnatural angle, a condition that is unique to solitary confinement.\n173. Polunsky Defendants Rehse and Harris were aware of the inhumane conditions Mr. \nHope endured, and the serious risks such conditions posed.  Mr. Rehse authorized many of Mr. \nHopeโs cell transfers, and Mr. Rehse was familiar with the deplorable conditions within those \ncellsโincluding because Mr. Hope personally showed Mr. Rehse mold in his cell.  Mr. Hope \npersonally made Mr. Rehse and Mr. Harris aware of his frequent moves and the dangerous \nconditions within those cells, and Mr. Hope filed multiple grievances about his cell conditions.  \nDespite their knowledge, Mr. Rehse and Mr. Harris did nothing to prevent or alleviate the \ninhumane conditions and instead continued to move him, even placing Mr. Hope in five different \ncells containing mold in one three-week period in 2017.  Nor did either Polunsky Defendant help \nMr. Hope access mental health care (even after Mr. Hope expressed concerns to them about \nneeding help), take meaningful steps to transition Mr. Hope out of solitary, or decrease the rate of \nhis unnecessary cell moves.  The Polunsky Defendantsโ awareness of the deplorable conditions of \nconfinement and refusal to remedy them constituted significant deprivations of basic human needs, \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment.  \n58\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 66 of 80 PageID #:\n678\n174. The Classification Defendants were likewise aware of the deplorable conditions \nMr. Hope experienced.  Mr. Hope raised these conditions to the Classification Defendants, both \ndirectly and indirectly through advocates, at SCC review hearings, in letters and emails, and on \nphone calls.  The Classification Defendants also had significant experience within the prison \nsystem to understand the unique hardships imposed by solitary confinement and the negative \nhealth effects of extended time in isolation.  Yet the Classification Defendants ignored this \nknowledge and instead relegated Mr. Hope to remain in these deplorable conditions and in \nsegregation for year after year.\n175. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants were also part of a \nconspiracy directed, in part, at keeping Mr. Hope in solitary indefinitely which increased the length \nof time he was confined under inhumane conditions.  As entrants into the conspiracy, each shares \nresponsibility.  Bevill v. Fletcher, 26 F.4th 270, 283-84 (5th Cir. 2022). \n176. The Polunsky Defendants and Classification Defendants knew about the inhumane \nand  unsanitary  conditions  of  Mr.  Hopeโs  confinement  and  acted  with  malice  or  reckless \nindifference to Mr. Hopeโs rights by, among other acts, failing to remedy the deplorable conditions.  \n177. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages against \nthe Polunsky Defendants and Classification Defendants to make him whole for the years of pain \nand suffering he experienced while relegated to solitary confinement in such conditions. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nRetaliation Under the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n(Polunsky Defendant Rehse and Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n178. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as if fully set forth herein.\n179. The  First  Amendment,  enforceable  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983,  prohibits \nretaliation against a prisoner for engaging in a protected activity.  U.S. Const. amend. I.  A prisoner \n59\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 67 of 80 PageID #:\n679\nwill prevail on a claim for retaliation if he establishes (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the \ndefendantโs intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory \nadverse act, and (4) causation.  See, e.g., Morris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2006).\n180. Filing grievances against prison staff is protected First Amendment activity.  See, \ne.g., Woods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir. 1995).  \n181. Contacting outside advocates as part of oneโs right to use the mail to access the \ncourts and government officials is protected First Amendment activity.  See, e.g., Woods, 60 F.3d \nat 1164 (exercising oneโs right of access to the courts is protected First Amendment activity); \nTaylor v. Sterrett, 532 F.2d 462, 470 (5th Cir. 1976) (agreeing that mail is protected from \ncensorship when transmitted between prisoners and courts, governmental agencies, lawyers, or \npress because such protection is โcompelled by the constitutional rights of the prisonersโ).\n182. Communicating with the media is protected First Amendment activity.  See, e.g., \nPell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974); Taylor, 532 F.2d at 479, 481.\n183. Mr. Hope engaged in protected First Amendment activity.  He filed grievances, \nspoke with the media, asked advocates to speak on his behalf, and wrote letters to TDCJ and state \nofficials, including to the Classification Defendants, starting no later than 2011.  \n184. The  Classification  Defendants  were  aware  of  Mr.  Hopeโs  protected  First \nAmendment activity.  Indeed, they were the recipients of many of Mr. Hopeโs and his advocatesโ \nletters, phone calls, and emails.  Mr. Hope also filed grievances about SCC review hearings \nconducted by Classification Defendants Bennett, Enloe, and Fiveash, as well as about the SCC and \nclassification generally.  Polunsky Defendant Rehse was aware of Mr. Hopeโs protected activity, \nincluding from Mr. Rehseโs participation in Mr. Hopeโs review hearings.  Other co-conspirators \n60\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 68 of 80 PageID #:\n680\nalso knew of Mr. Hopeโs protected activity; letters were sent to and grievances filed about Ms. \nJones, and Mr. Hope filed grievances and spoke to officials about Mr. McMullenโs actions.   \n185. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants were on notice under \ndecades-old caselaw that filing grievances, reaching out to and through outside advocates, and \nspeaking to the media is protected First Amendment activity.  Moreover, Defendants had notice \nthat prisoners have these rights based on TDCJโs own policies and trainings.\n186. The Classification Defendants, especially Classification Defendant White, were \nnonetheless  angered  by  Mr.  Hopeโs  protected  activity.    The  Classification  Defendants  and \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse intended to retaliate against Mr. Hope and warned Mr. Hope against \ncontinuing his protected activities.  For example, Polunsky Defendant Rehse remarked, in sum or \nin substance, that Mr. Hope was his own worst enemy, indicating his conditions were tied with his \nefforts to challenge his segregation conditions.  Classification Defendant Enloe was known to \nappear at Mr. Hopeโs SCC review hearings only during periods when Mr. Hope and his advocates \nwere being the most vocal.  And Ms. Enloe, at the direction of Ms. White, communicated to Mr. \nHope that having his advocates contact classification would not benefit Mr. Hope.\n187. In reaction to Mr. Hopeโs protected First Amendment activity, the Classification \nDefendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse retaliated against Mr. Hope.  Their retaliatory acts \nincluded, but were not limited to, extending Mr. Hopeโs solitary confinement indefinitely, planting \na screwdriver in his cell and using the resulting manufactured disciplinary charges as excuses for \nhis continued segregation, and relocating Mr. Hope to hundreds of different cells.  These retaliatory \nactions often followed soon after Mr. Hope had engaged in a protected activity and were designed \nto discourage Mr. Hope from continuing to exercise his First Amendment rights.\n61\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 69 of 80 PageID #:\n681\n188. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants were also part of a \nconspiracy that was directed, in part, at punishing Mr. Hope for challenging his confinement \nconditions and Defendantsโ actions toward him, and at silencing Mr. Hope and his advocates so \ntheir actions could go undetected.  Defendantsโ co-conspirators carried out additional retaliatory \nacts against Mr. Hope in furtherance of the conspiracy, such as by confiscating Mr. Hopeโs \ntypewriter that he used to type grievances and by moving a chemical-covered Mr. Hope into a cell \nwith a disabled sink so he had no way to clean himself for a week-long period.  As entrants into \nthe  conspiracy,  Polunsky  Defendant  Rehse  and  the  Classification  Defendants  each  share \nresponsibility for their co-conspiratorsโ acts.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 283-84. \n189. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants knew of Mr. Hopeโs \nright to engage in First Amendment activity, yet retaliated against Mr. Hope for such activity and \ndid so with malice or reckless indifference to Mr. Hopeโs rights, including, extending Mr. Hopeโs \ntime in solitary indefinitely, manufacturing disciplinary charges, confiscating his typewriter, and \nmoving him to hundreds of cells, among other acts as pled in this complaint.\n190. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages against \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants for repeatedly retaliating against him \nand causing him pain and suffering due to his participation in protected First Amendment activity.\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nViolation of Procedural Due Process Under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n(Polunsky Defendant Rehse and Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n191. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as if fully incorporated herein.\n192. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable via 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, provides that no state shall deprive any person of liberty without due process of law.  U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV.  To determine what process is due, a court determines whether there is a \n62\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 70 of 80 PageID #:\n682\nliberty interest that has been interfered with by the state, and whether the procedures โattendant \nupon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.โ  Richardson v. Tex. Secโy of State, 978 F.3d \n220, 228-29 (5th Cir. 2020).  The constitutional sufficiency of procedures is determined by \nweighing three factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the \nrisk of erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used, and (3) the stateโs \ninterest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that additional \nor substitute procedures would entail.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).\n193. Prison officials must engage in the periodic review of the confinement of prisoners \nin segregation and may not use segregation โas a pretext for indefinite confinement.โ  Hewitt, 459 \nU.S.  at  477  n.9.    Periodic  reviews,  like  any  process  that  is  constitutionally  due,  must  be \nโmeaningful.โ  See, e.g., Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965).\n194. Conversely,  if  an  official  engages  in  โperfunctory  exchangesโ  regarding  a \nprisonerโs eligibility for release from solitary and fails to explain their reasoning for retaining a \nprisoner in solitary, then the official has failed to provide adequate due process.  Wilkerson v. \nStalder, No. 00-304-JJB, 2013 WL 6665452, at *11 (M.D. La. Dec. 17, 2013), affโd sub nom. \nWilkerson  v.  Goodwin,  774  F.3d  845  (5th  Cir.  2014).    Periodic  reviews  are  similarly  not \nmeaningful if the decisionmaker at the review either lacks or disclaims the authority to release the \nperson being โreviewedโ from segregation.  See Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, 1366 (S.D. \nTex. 1980), affโd in part, revโd in part on other grounds, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir. 1982), amended \nin part, vacated in part on other grounds, 688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1982).\n195. Mr. Hope established a liberty interest due to his indefinite placement in solitary \nwithout eligibility for parole.  Hope v. Harris, 861 F. Appโx 571, 580 (5th Cir. 2021); see also \nWilkerson, 774 F.3d at 853, 856 (recognizing that solitary confinement that causes โatypical and \n63\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 71 of 80 PageID #:\n683\nsignificant hardship,โ including hardship due to an extraordinary length of time in segregation, is \nsufficient to demonstrate a liberty interest).\n196. Mr. Hope had a strong interest in meaningful review for placement in G.P. as \nopposed to solitary confinement.  Within prison systems, including TDCJ, the difference in \ntreatment of and resources available to prisoners between solitary and G.P. is marked, including \nthat G.P. provides social contact with others, space to move, and access to programming such as \nreligious services and vocational trainingโwhich are significant in parole consideration.  \n197. Mr. Hope faced a high risk of, and in fact experienced, an erroneous deprivation of \nthis liberty interest through the procedures used: his SCC review hearings were a mere sham, with \nprocedures that could be, and were repeatedly, tampered with at the whim of the Classification \nDefendants.    \n198. From 1995 until 2022, Mr. Hope attended an SCC review hearing approximately \nevery six months, or roughly 56 times, to have his classification reviewed.  Throughout that time, \nmultiple SCC members told Mr. Hope that they saw no reason not to release him to G.P.  At least \ntwo SCC members, on three separate occasions, told Mr. Hope that they decided to release him.  \nBut, each time, the Classification Defendants or their co-conspirators interfered, citing that they \nlacked the power to actually authorize the change.  The SCCโs decisions were inexplicably \nreversed by committees or administrators outside the appeals process and who Mr. Hope was not \nable to petition.  The Classification Defendants told Mr. Hope that there was nothing he could do \nto challenge this outcome and, as such, he would never get out of solitary.  Given that the \ndecisionmakers at the dozens of hearings Mr. Hope attended lacked or disclaimed the authority to \nrelease him, such process amounted to nothing more than sham hearings.\n64\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 72 of 80 PageID #:\n684\n199. Classification Defendants Enloe, Bennett, and Fiveash, and others presiding over \nMr. Hopeโs periodic reviews, did not articulate reasoning as to why he continued to be housed for \nyears on end in segregation.  Instead, the Classification Defendants manufactured shifting and \ncontradictory justifications for his continued segregation, including his long-ago escape and \nundocumented designations as โhigh profileโ or โunusual and difficult.โ  Engaging only in \nperfunctory exchanges, the Classification Defendants never offered Mr. Hope an explanation of \nhow or why these designations were applied, what they meant, or how they could be removed or \nchallenged.  In essence, and as admitted by at least one SCC member, the SCC review hearings \nwere mere โwelfare checksโ and little more than a rubber stamp on the Classification Defendantsโ \npre-determined decision to keep Mr. Hope isolatedโin short, sham decisions.  \n200. Classification Defendants Echessa and White similarly received multiple letters, \nphone calls, emails, grievances, and pleas from Mr. Hope and his advocates, but each continued \nrejecting or ignoring Mr. Hopeโs claims of due process violations.  Both Mr. Echessa and Ms. \nWhite had supervisory authority over Mr. Hopeโs periodic review hearings and authorized the \nperfunctory review hearings that kept Mr. Hope in segregation without constitutionally adequate \nprocess.  As Mr. Treon told the media, the Director of Classification decided Mr. Hope โwill never \nget out of Seg.โ  Mr. Echessa and Ms. White could have corrected these constitutional violations \nbut instead allowed Mr. Hope to languish in solitary based on sham โhearings.โ \n201. Mr. Hope was released from solitary confinement only after he filed a petition for \ncertiorari with the Supreme Court.  The alleged February 2022 review hearing where this release \ndecision was made (of which Mr. Hope received no notice or decision) was scheduled irregularly \nand seemingly only as a litigation tactic to avoid liability for injunctive relief.\n65\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 73 of 80 PageID #:\n685\n202. Polunsky Defendant Rehse was part of the SCC panel at three of Mr. Hopeโs SCC \nreview hearings that lacked due process.  Mr. Rehse also joined in a conspiracy to deprive Mr. \nHope of his due process rights.  As a member of the conspiracy, Mr. Rehse shares in the \nresponsibility for this constitutional deprivation.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 283-84. \n203. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants knew Mr. Hope was \nentitled to periodic reviews of his confinement in solitary, and they acted with malice or reckless \nindifference to that right by, among other actions pled in the complaint, reversing SCC decisions \nto release Mr. Hope from solitary, disclaiming authority to release Mr. Hope from solitary, and \nfailing to provide justification for Mr. Hopeโs indefinite confinement.\n204. Mr. Hope seeks compensatory and punitive damages against the Classification \nDefendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse for the pain and suffering he faced while indefinitely \nrelegated to segregation, with no ability to rejoin G.P. or be released on parole. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nConspiracy Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n(Polunsky Defendant Rehse and All Classification Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n205. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as though fully set forth herein.\n206. Conspiring to deprive someone of their constitutional rights is prohibited under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983.  A plaintiff will prevail on a claim for conspiracy if he establishes: (1) an agreement \namong the alleged co-conspirators to deprive the plaintiff of a constitutional right and (2) that the \nalleged deprivation actually occurred.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 274-75.  \n207. Plausibly alleging conspiracy merely requires โenough facts to raise a reasonable \nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.โ  See id. at 284; see also Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007).  Evidence of a common motive among co-\nconspirators contributes to the plausibility of such a claim.  Bevill, 26 F.4th at 284 (holding that \n66\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 74 of 80 PageID #:\n686\nplaintiff satisfied the pleading requirement on his conspiracy claim by alleging that co-conspirators \nwere motivated to protect their reputations and had โworked closely with one anotherโ).\n208. A conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 acts โas the legal mechanism through \nwhich to impose liability on each and all of the Defendants without regard to the person doing the \nparticular act.โ  Nesmith v. Alford, 318 F.2d 110, 126 (5th Cir. 1963).  Thus, โregardless of whether \nor not [a defendantโs] actions alone actually caused a constitutional violation, liability can still be \nimposed on [his] alleged membership in [the] conspiracy.โ  Latiolais v. Cravins, 484 F. Appโx \n983, 991 (5th Cir. 2012).\n209. Additionally, โ[a] coconspirator is bound by the overt acts of other coconspirators \nfurthering the conspiracy both before and after being enlisted even though he may not participate \nin each overt act.โ  In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 623 F. Supp. 2d 798, 830-\n31 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (quoting U.S. v. Spudic, 795 F.2d 1334, 1337 (7th Cir.1986)); see also United \nStates v. Rodriguez-Lopez, 756 F.3d 422, 430 (5th Cir. 2014).\n210. The Classification Defendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse conspired to deny \nMr.  Hope  of  his  rights  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States \nConstitution.\n211. The  Classification  Defendants,  Polunsky  Defendant  Rehse,  and  their  co-\nconspirators shared a common motive for retaliating against Mr. Hope: to protect their personal \nreputations and careers.  First, Mr. Hopeโs advocacy, both on his own and through outside \nadvocates, invited public scrutiny to Defendantsโ and their co-conspiratorsโ actions and threatened \ntheir personal and professional reputations.  Second, Defendants and their co-conspirators had \npersonal vendettas against Mr. Hope, as they still harbored resentment due to Mr. Hopeโs escape \nin the early 1990s.  Mr. Hopeโs ability to outsmart the system was a huge embarrassment for those \n67\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 75 of 80 PageID #:\n687\nwhose profession it was to keep him incarcerated.  Third, once their misconduct had begun, Mr. \nHopeโs willingness to file grievances and write letters to SCC, TDCJ, and state officials could lead \nto internal investigations and Defendants and their co-conspirators were motivated to protect their \ncareers and reputations.\n212. The Classification Defendants and Polunsky Defendant Rehse worked closely with \neach other and with their co-conspirators.  All were employed in the same prison system and had \nthe  opportunity  to  easily  meet  and  communicate  with  one  another.    Further,  many  of  the \nDefendants  and  co-conspirators  reported  to  one  another  in  the  systemโs  official  hierarchy.  \nClassification Defendant Echessa, for example, was Classification Defendant Whiteโs supervisor, \nwho in turn was Classification Defendant Enloeโs superior. \n213. Defendants and their co-conspirators sought to silence Mr. Hope by manufacturing \nreasons to keep him in solitary, inflicting pain and suffering, and breaking Mr. Hopeโs will to \nprotest.  \n214. Although they did not succeed in breaking Mr. Hopeโs will, Defendants actually \ndenied Mr. Hope his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution.\n215. Since 2011, members of the conspiracy, in agreement with or at the direction of \ntheir co-conspirators:\na. Subjected Mr. Hope to sham hearings with a pre-determined outcome, denied \ntheir ability to release Mr. Hope from segregation, and reversed, or allowed to \nbe reversed, SCC decisions requiring that Mr. Hope be released to G.P.;\nb. Fabricated disciplinary cases in order to justify keeping Mr. Hope in solitary;\n68\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 76 of 80 PageID #:\n688\nc. Confiscated Mr. Hopeโs typewriter, which he used to file grievances and \ncommunicate with advocates, and tampered with his legal communications and \nother advocacy-related documents;\nd. Subjected Mr. Hope to a chemical agent, without allowing him to clean off the \nchemicals for multiple days, in order to deter Mr. Hope from further advocacy;\ne. Moved Mr. Hope from cell to cell in order to disorient him and undermine his \nability to advocate for himself;\nf. Continued to rubber-stamp Mr. Hopeโs confinement in deplorable conditions, \nwhich were known to be harmfulโfor 17 additional years after any penological \njustification for keeping him in solitary confinement had evaporatedโalthough \nthey had the power to authorize Mr. Hopeโs move to G.P.\n216. The conspiracy to retaliate against Mr. Hope and deprive him of his due process \nrights spanned many years.  All Defendants involved in any portion of the conspiracy are liable \nbecause of their membership in it. \n217. Polunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants conspired to, and did, \ndeprive Mr. Hope of his constitutional rights.  In planning and executing their conspiracy, \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants acted with malice or reckless \nindifference to Mr. Hopeโs rights by, among other actions pled in this complaint, agreeing โneverโ \nto release him, disregarding his requests for help, and fabricating disciplinary cases against him.\n218. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages against \nPolunsky Defendant Rehse and the Classification Defendants for the harm inflicted against him \nthrough their conspiracy to deprive him of his constitutional rights.\n69\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 77 of 80 PageID #:\n689\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nCruel and Unusual Punishment Under the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\nBased on Excessive Force\n(All Ellis Defendants in their Personal Capacities)\n219. Mr. Hope incorporates paragraphs 1 through 166 as though fully set forth herein.\n220. As described, the Eighth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \nprohibits โcruel and unusual punishments.โ  U.S. Const. amend. VIII.  In claims under the Eighth \nAmendment arising from the use of excessive force, the โcore judicial inquiryโ is โwhether force \nwas applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically \nto cause harm,โ or more simply, whether the defendant had a subjective intent to punish.  Cowart \nv. Erwin, 837 F.3d 444, 452 (5th Cir. 2016) (citing Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1992)).  \nThe officialโs intent in applying force is โdetermined by reference to the well-known Hudson \nfactorsโthe extent of injury suffered, the need for application of force, the relationship between \nthat need and the amount of force used, the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible officials, \nand any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.โ  Id. at 452-53 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).\n221. Ellis Defendants Simmons and Clark violated Mr. Hopeโs clearly established \nEighth Amendment rights when they applied and maintained overly tightened handcuffs to Mr. \nHopeโs wrists for more than 24 hours while he suffered from pneumonia and struggled to breathe.  \nThis use of excessive force caused Mr. Hope severe pain and lasting damage.\n222. Ellis Defendant Simmons was responsible for preparing Mr. Hope for an immediate \ntransfer by ambulance.  Ms. Simmons knew Mr. Hope needed urgent medical care.  Despite that \nknowledge, Ms. Simmons took steps to delay his transfer.  After Sergeant Schwartz properly \napplied handcuffs to Mr. Hopeโs wrists, Ms. Simmons had the restraints removed so that she could \n70\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 78 of 80 PageID #:\n690\nimproperly reapply the handcuffs, this time clamping the metal so tightly that Mr. Hopeโs wrists \nand hands lost circulation, feeling, and their normal color.\n223. When Ellis Defendant Clark took control at the hospital, nurses pointed out to Mr. \nClark multiple times that Mr. Hopeโs wrists and hands were discolored and losing circulation, and \nthe nurses asked Mr. Clark why the handcuffs were so tight.  Mr. Clark responded only with vague \nreferences to having a reason for hurting Mr. Hope and with demands that the nurses let Mr. Clark \nhandle security without questions.  For the next 24 hours, the restraints were not adjusted and Mr. \nHope experienced severe discomfort, lost feeling in his wrists and hands, and his wrists bled.  The \nrestraints were only corrected when a doctor involved Warden Strong to direct the handcuffs be \napplied correctly.\n224. The Ellis Defendants inflicted this pain on Mr. Hope wantonly and with complete \ndisregard for the risk of harm their actions posed.  Each Ellis Defendant knew that Mr. Hope was \nexperiencing respiratory distress requiring emergency medical attention, that the handcuffs were \napplied too tightly, and that the excessive restraint would or had caused Mr. Hope pain and \ndiscomfort and to lose color and feeling in his hands.\n225. The need for application of force was low.  Mr. Hope was in respiratory distress, \nwas compliant, and was seeking necessary emergency medical care.  The Ellis Defendants knew \nthe wrist handcuffs were only one of multiple security measures in place, as Mr. Hope was also in \nankle and waist shackles and was accompanied by officers at all times.  Yet the Ellis Defendants \nmade no efforts to temper their responses.  Their excessive use of force against Mr. Hope was done \nmaliciously and sadistically and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. \n226. Mr. Hope suffers from lasting numbness and pain in his wrists and hands. \n71\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 79 of 80 PageID #:\n691\n227. The Ellis Defendants knew of the risks posed by an excessive use of force against \nMr. Hope, and they acted with malice or reckless indifference towards Mr. Hopeโs rights by, \namong other acts pled in the complaint, applying and maintaining overly-tightened handcuffs to \nMr. Hopeโs wrists for more than 24 hours, despite medical staff pointing out the deleterious effects.\n228. Mr. Hope seeks relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages from Ellis \nDefendants Simmons and Clark for inflicting cruel and unusual punishment against him while he \nsought emergency medical treatment.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Mr. Hope demands the following relief against Defendants, jointly and \nseverally:\nA. Compensatory damages in an amount just and reasonable and in conformity with \nthe evidence at trial;\nB. Punitive damages to the extent allowable by law;\nC. Nominal damages;\nD. Costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneysโ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and \nother applicable laws; and\nE. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n72\n\nCase 9:18-cv-00027-MAC-ZJH     Document 54     Filed 02/05/24     Page 80 of 80 PageID #:\n692\nDated: February 2, 2024 Respectfully submitted,\nMEHAFFY WEBER, P.C.\n/s/ M.C.
