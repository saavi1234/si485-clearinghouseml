    "summary": "<p>This case involved allegations of excessive force by a correctional officer. On September 11, 2018, a prisoner in San Quentin State Prison filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against a correctional officer in San Quentin State Prison under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. Originally filing pro se, the plaintiff alleged that he was attacked by other incarcerated individuals when the defendant correctional officer intervened by shooting the plaintiff several times. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The case was assigned to Judge Beth Labson Freeman.</p>\r\n<p>Following the court&rsquo;s dismissal of the complaint with leave to amend on January 16, 2019, on February 19, 2019, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint with additional factual allegations and attachments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 11th, 2019 the court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend for the plaintiff to file an amended complaint that complied with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On August 15, 2019, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On March 2, 2020, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff&rsquo;s second amended complaint. On March 6, 2020, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint adding claims against the warden and the Director of the CDCR based on supervisor liability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendant moved to dismiss this complaint, which the court denied as moot on April 23rd, 2020. The court ordered that the third amended complaint was the operative complaint in this matter under Rule 15(a)(1)(B). On the same day, the court denied plaintiff&rsquo;s fourth motion for appointment of counsel and granted plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for extension of time to complete discovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 2nd, 2020, the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, saying that the defendant had shown that there was an available administrative remedy and the plaintiff did not exhaust that available administrative remedy before he filed the action, though he had since. The court also ruled that the additional claims in the third amended complaint allegations were insufficient to support a claim of supervisor liability and dismissed them without leave to amend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 28, 2020, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 23rd, 2022, the panel reversed the district court&rsquo;s dismissal for lack of exhaustion and remanded, clarifying Jackson v. Fong&rsquo;s holding that a prisoner who has fully complied with the PLRA&rsquo;s exhaustion requirement does not need to file a new complaint simply because he had not exhausted when he filed his original federal complaint.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;On June 17, 2024, the Court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for terminating sanctions. The Court found that the plaintiff was a prolific litigator and declared three-strikes litigant with a history of filing frivolous litigant and refusing to comply with court orders, and that in the present case had willfully refused to be deposed, among other similar tactics. On the same date, for the same reasons, the court found for the defendant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Despite multiple court orders and the courtโs\n5 and counselโs warnings that he may be subject to sanctionsโincluding the dismissal of this\n6 actionโPlaintiff initially refused to be sworn, and then insisted that he may be represented by\n7 counsel, as well as other untruths, to prevent his deposition from proceeding.  And he has been\n8 using the same tactics in his other pending litigation, including one case that was just dismissed\n9 for Plaintiff repeated, willful refusal to be deposed.  Because Plaintiff is a prolific litigator and\n10 declared three-strikes litigant, who is currently proceeding in forma pauperis, nothing short of\n11 terminating sanctions will stop his continued waste of party and judicial resources.  This court\n12 should dismiss the action with prejudice, and award Defendants costs and attorneysโ fees\n13 reasonably incurred in their second and third attempts to take Plaintiffโs deposition.\n14 BACKGROUND\n15 Plaintiff is a prolific litigator and declared three-strikes litigant with a history of filing\n16 frivolous litigant and refusing to comply with court orders.  (See ECF No. 75-2 at ยถยถ 18-20.)  In\n17 this action, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Clawson, a correctional officer at San Quentin State\n18 Prison, utilized excessive force against Plaintiff when Defendant Clawson discharged a sponge\n19 round at Plaintiffโs lower extremities, while Plaintiff was engaged in a fight with multiple\n20 inmates.  (ECF No. 29 at 4.)  But Plaintiff has now thrice prevented Defendant Clawson from\n21 asking Plaintiff questions about his allegations.\n22 A. Plaintiff Refused to Be Deposed on November 17, 2022.\n23 Defendant Clawson initially noticed Plaintiffโs deposition for November 17, 2022.  (ECF\n24 No. 63-2 at 1-2.)  Between the date the deposition notice was served and the date of the\n25 deposition, defense counsel did not receive any communication from Plaintiff, let alone any\n26 objection to the taking of his deposition.  (Id. at 2.)  However, on November 17, 2022, Plaintiff\n27 refused to be transported to the deposition location.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Plaintiff demanded various\n28 accommodations before he would agree to be transported, but correctional staff reviewed\n1\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 4 of 14\n1 Plaintiffโs electronic prison file and determined that he was not entitled to any of the demanded\n2 accommodations.  (Id.)  Because Plaintiff would not agree to be transported to the deposition\n3 without those accommodations, the deposition could not proceed and was suspended.  (Id.)\n4 Defendant Clawson incurred $1,108.25 in costs and fees associated with his attempt to\n5 depose Plaintiff on November 17, 2022.  (Id. at 3.)\n6 B. Plaintiff Was Ordered to Appear for and Submit to an Oral Deposition on\nFebruary 9, 2023, but Again Refused.\n7\n8 Defendant Clawson moved to compel Plaintiffโs deposition, and re-noticed Plaintiffโs\n9 deposition for February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m.1  (ECF No. 63; ECF No. 75-2 at ยถ 3.)  Plaintiff\n10 opposed the motion to compel, and in his opposition he requested the appointment of counsel.\n11 (ECF No. 65.)  The court granted Defendantโs motion to compel, admonishing Plaintiff that\n12 unless he โprefers the more severe sanction of dismissal of this entire action for his refusal to\n13 appear for the deposition under Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(v) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, he\n14 shall appear for and submit to an oral deposition on February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. as he has been\n15 noticed by Defendantโs counsel.โ  (ECF No. 67 at 4.)  In the same order, the court denied\n16 Plaintiffโs request for appointment of counsel, noting the court had already denied multiple\n17 requests by Plaintiff and explaining that โ[p]reparing for a deposition is not an exceptional\n18 circumstance that warrants the appointment of counsel.โ  (Id.)\n19 Therefore, on February 9, 2023, defense counsel appeared in person for Plaintiffโs\n20 deposition.  (ECF No. 75-2 at ยถ 7.)  Plaintiff appeared, was swornโthough he objected to taking\n21 the oathโand stated his name for the record.  (ECF No. 75-3, Exh. 4 at 5:1-25.)  But after that,\n22 Plaintiff refused to answer questions.  (See id. at 6:1-16:7.)  Plaintiff objected that he risked\n23 โwaiving an objection provided by the errors and irregularities occurring at the oral deposition โฆ\n24 in the manner of taking the deposition in a form of questions and answers[,] in the oath or\n25 affirmation[,] or in the conduct of the parties and errors of any kind[,] which might be obviated or\n26 removed or cured if promptly presented or waived unless suitable objection thereto was made at\n27 the taking of the deposition.โ  (Id. at 6:2-16.)  Plaintiff went on to object that he could not proceed\n28 1 He also moved for monetary sanctions, which were denied.  (SeeECF Nos. 63, 67.)\n2\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 5 of 14\n1 because he โdid not have the assistance of counsel and absence,โ and could not โmake\n2 uncounseled responses.โ  (Id.)  Plaintiff also objected that he was not prepared due to several\n3 medical issues,โ but would identify the medical issues.  (Id. at 7:1-25.)\n4 Defense counsel presented Plaintiff with a copy of the courtโs order granting Defendantโs\n5 motion to compel, and Plaintiff acknowledged receiving the order and acknowledged that he\n6 understood his deposition testimony had been compelled.  (Id. at 9:11-12:13.)  Defense counsel\n7 read Plaintiff the portion of the order in which the court advised Plaintiff that if he did not appear\n8 for and submit to an oral deposition, the action could be terminated, and later orally advised\n9 Plaintiff that his failure to answer questions could result in monetary and/or terminating\n10 sanctions.  (Id. at 9:11-16:7.)  But Plaintiff just repeated his objection about the risk of waiving\n11 the โerrors and irregularitiesโ with the deposition if he proceeded without counsel, confirmed that\n12 objection would be his response to every question posed, and reiterated that he would not answer\n13 questions without the assistance of counsel.  (Id.)  The deposition was then suspended.  (Id.)\n14 C. Defendant Moved for Terminating Sanctions, Which Were Denied, But\nPlaintiff Was Afforded a Final Opportunity to Sit for and Participate in\n15 His Deposition.\n16 Defendant Clawson sought terminating and monetary sanctions for Plaintiffโs repeated\n17 refusal to participate in his deposition.  (ECF No. 75.)  This Court found Defendantโs motion\n18 โpersuasive,โ but โin the interest of justice and his pro se status,โ the Court denied the motion\n19 without prejudice so that Plaintiff could be afforded โone final opportunity to comply and submit\n20 to an oral deposition, which includes making a good faith effort to answer all questions posed by\n21 Defendantโs counsel.โ  (ECF No. 88 at 5.)  Plaintiff was warned that โhis failure to appear and\n22 answer questions in good faith will result in terminating sanctions and the award or reasonable\n23 fees and costs to Defendantโs counsel.โ  (Id. at 5.)\n24 Defendant Clawson noticed Plaintiffโs deposition for October 4, 2023, at 10:00 a.m.\n25 (Shryock Decl., ยถ 5.)  Defendant Clawson served Plaintiff with notice of the deposition on\n26 September 11, 2023, and simultaneously served Plaintiff with an additional copy of the courtโs\n27 order (ECF No. 88), and offering to accommodate any medical needs Plaintiff had.  (Shryock\n28\n3\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 6 of 14\n1 Decl., ยถ 5, Exhs. 1-2.)  Between September 11 and October 4, 2023, defense counsel did not\n2 receive any communications from Plaintiff.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 6.)\n3 D. Plaintiff Prevented His Deposition from Proceeding on October 4, 2023.\n4 On October 4, 2023, defense counsel again traveled to San Quentin State Prison to depose\n5 Plaintiff.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 7.)  However, Plaintiff initially refused to be sworn on various\n6 grounds, including a religious objection, claiming not to understand the oath, and because he was\n7 in the process of obtaining counsel.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 8, Exh. 3 at 6:8-9:9.)  Plaintiff later was\n8 sworn, but he objected to being placed under oath, claiming he was under โduressโ because of the\n9 courtโs orders.  (Shryock Decl., Exh. 3 at 14:13-16:19.)  Plaintiff acknowledged receiving the\n10 amended notice of deposition, as well as counselโs letter about requesting accommodations for\n11 the deposition.  (Id. at 11:3-13:22.)  Plaintiff admitted he never responded to either.  (Id.)\n12 Plaintiff maintainedโDefendant contends erroneouslyโthat he โmay beโ represented by\n13 counsel because he had corresponded with multiple attorneys about taking his case.  (Id. at 9:10-\n14 10:22, 13:11-22, 17:14-18:5.)  But Plaintiffโs most recent communication with an attorney about\n15 potentially taking his case was a letter dated July 2023.  (Id.)  Based upon Plaintiffโs\n16 representation that he โdid not knowโ whether he was represented by counsel and that he โmay\n17 beโ represented, counsel did not believe she could proceed with the deposition, and therefore\n18 suspended the deposition at that time.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 11, Exh. 3 at 17:14-18:21.)\n19 Defendant Clawson now renews his motion for terminating sanctions.\n20 DISCUSSION\n21 I. THECOURTSHOULDTERMINATETHISACTION WITHPREJUDICE FORPLAINTIFFโS\nREPEATEDFAILURE TOCOOPERATE INDISCOVERY ANDCOMPLY WITHCOURT\n22 ORDERS.\n23 Plaintiffโs repeated, willful refusal to sit for and submit to deposition warrants terminating\n24 sanctions.  District courts have the inherent power to control their dockets, and โin the exercise of\n25 that power they may impose sanctions including dismissal of a case.โ Thompson v. Housing\n26 Auth., 782 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir. 1986).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A)(v),\n27 district courts are empowered to dismiss an action if a party fails to obey an order to provide or\n28 permit discovery.  Similarly, Rule 41(b) expressly authorizes dismissals for failure to comply\n4\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 7 of 14\n1 with a court order.  The standards governing dismissals under these two rules are โbasically the\n2 same.โ Malone v. U.S. Postal Serv., 833 F.2d 128, 130 (9th Cir. 1987) (reviewing dismissal\n3 under Rules 37 and 41).\n4 In determining if dismissal is the appropriate sanction, courts weigh five factors: (1) the\n5 public interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the courtโs need to manage its docket; (3)\n6 the risk of prejudice to the defendants; (4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their\n7 merits; (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions. Pagtalunan v. Galaza, 291 F.3d 639, 641\n8 (9th Cir. 1986).  Although it is preferred, it is not required that the district court make explicit\n9 findings to show that it has considered these factors. Yourish v. Cal. Amplifier, 191 F.3d 983, 990\n10 (9th Cir. 1999).  These factors are tools of analysis, not โconditions precedentโ to the district\n11 courtโs imposition of sanctions. Allen v. Bayer Corp. (In re PPA), 460 F.3d 1217, 1226 (9th Cir.\n12 2006).  Here, the factors weigh in favor of terminating sanctions.\n13 A. The First and Second Factorsโthe Public Interest in Expeditious\nResolution and Management of the Courtโs DocketโWeigh in Favor of\n14 Dismissal.\n15 The first two factorsโexpeditious resolution and the Courtโs docket managementโalways\n16 weigh in favor of dismissal. Malone, 833 F.2d at 130-31.  The public has โan overriding interestโ\n17 in the orderly, expeditious, and inexpensive determination of every action. In re PPA, 460 F.3d at\n18 1227.  Delay in reaching the merits is โcostly in money, memory, manageability, and confidence\n19 in the process.โ Id. at 1227.  Although cases generally should be disposed of on their merits, a\n20 plaintiff is responsible for moving his case toward that disposition. See Morris v. Morgan Stanley\n21 & Co., 942 F.2d 648, 652 (9th Cir. 1991).  The power to invoke terminating sanctions โis\n22 necessary in order to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases and to avoid\n23 congestion in the calendars of the district courts.โ Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 371 U.S. 626, 629 โ\n24 30 (1962).\n25 Here, Plaintiffโs repeated and willful refusal to submit to depositionโin contravention of\n26 two court ordersโis impeding the advancement of this case.  This action was filed on September\n27 11, 2018.  (ECF No. 1.)  Yet, five years later, Defendant cannot determine whether a dispositive\n28 motion is appropriate, or prepare one, until he has deposed Plaintiff.  And Plaintiff has prevented\n5\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 8 of 14\n1 him from doing that for almost one year.  (See ECF Nos. 62, 75.)  Plaintiffโs deposition was\n2 initially noticed for November 2022, but Plaintiff refused to be transported to the deposition\n3 location.  (See ECF No. 62.)  The court ordered Plaintiff to sit for deposition in February, and\n4 extended Defendantsโ deadline to file a summary-judgment motion.  (See ECF No. 67 at 4.)  But\n5 Plaintiff again refused to answer questions.  (ECF No. 75-3, Exh. 4.)  This Court then gave\n6 Plaintiff โone, final opportunityโ to answer Defendant Clawsonโs questions, but Plaintiff againโ\n7 for a third timeโimpeded Defendantโs ability to ask Plaintiff questions about this case.  (ECF\n8 No. 88 at 5.)  Plaintiffโs refusal to sit for deposition has resulted in no less than three motions\n9 being brought, and has extended discovery by one year.  Further, there is no indication that\n10 Plaintiff intends to change his behavior.  He recently had another case dismissed for his repeated\n11 refusal to sit for deposition (Shryock Decl., Exhs. 4-5), and yet in this and one other pending case\n12 he continues to refuse to be deposed unless he is represented by counsel.  (Shryock Dec., ยถ 19,\n13 Exh. 3.)\n14 Plaintiffโs behavior impedes the Courtโs strong interest in docket control and expeditious\n15 resolution of cases.  These factors weigh in favor of dismissal.\n16 B. The Third FactorโPrejudice to DefendantsโAlso Weighs in Favor of\nDismissal.\n17\n18 Defendant Clawson has been and continues to be prejudiced by Plaintiffโs refusal to sit for\n19 deposition and answer questions about his claim. See Adriana Intโl Corp. v. Thoeren, 913 F.2d\n20 1406, 1412 (9th Cir. 1990).  Prejudice may take the form of loss of evidence, loss of memory, and\n21 costs or burdens of litigation. In re PPA, 460 F.3d at 1338.  The law also presumes that an\n22 unreasonable delay causes prejudice. Anderson v. Air West Inc., 542 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir.\n23 1976).  Courts have interpreted Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) to require a plaintiff to\n24 prosecute with โreasonable diligenceโ to avoid dismissal. Id.  The failure to prosecute diligently\n25 is โsufficient by itself to justify dismissal, even in the absence of showing actual prejudice to the\n26 defendant from the failure.โ Id.\n27\n28\n6\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 9 of 14\n1 First, Defendant is prejudiced because he cannot defend against Plaintiffโs claim because he\n2 has not been able to ask Plaintiff about the facts that form the basis of that claim.  If Defendant\n3 Clawson cannot ask questions about the allegations against him, he cannot properly evaluate the\n4 claims against him or determine whether possible defenses are viable.  (ECF No. 75-2 at ยถ 17.)\n5 Thus, at this time, Defendant Clawson cannot prepare a summary-judgment motionโor even\n6 determine if such a motion is warrantedโor prepare a defense for trial.  (Id.)  Defendant Clawson\n7 is also prejudiced by the cost of repeatedly preparing for and attempting to depose Plaintiff, and\n8 bringing multiple discovery and extension motions before the court.  (See, e.g., ECF Nos. 63, 63-\n9 2 at 3; 75-2.)  Defendant Clawson incurred no less than $1,108.25 for his attempt to depose\n10 Plaintiff in November 2022, and he incurred an additional $1,952.05 and $2,015.56 in fees and\n11 costs in connection with Plaintiffโs (failed) February 9 and October 4, 2023, depositions.  (ECF\n12 No. 75-2 at ยถยถ 14-16; Shryock Decl., ยถยถ 13-15.)  And these costs are only a fraction of the costs\n13 Defendant Clawson actually incurred.  (See id.)\n14 Second, Plaintiffโs behavior has unreasonably delayed this action, and (after five years\n15 since Plaintiffโs allegations occurred), this leads to evidence loss, witness loss, and memory loss,\n16 all of which are prejudicial to Defendant Clawson.  And Plaintiffโs conduct is antithetical to his\n17 duty to prosecute his case.  The third factor favors dismissal.\n18 C. The Fourth FactorโPublic Policy Favoring a Merits DecisionโDoes Not\nFavor Dismissal, But Also Does Not Preclude It.\n19\n20 The only factor that weighs against dismissal is the public policy favoring disposition on\n21 the merits. In re PPA, 460 F.2d at 1228.  But โthis factor lends little support to a party whose\n22 responsibility is to move the case toward disposition on the merits but whose conduct impedes\n23 progress in that direction.โ Id. (internal quotations omitted).  Plaintiffโs error in โhalting\n24 movement towards a merits solutionโ should โsubstantially neutralize[] the negative effect of this\n25 factor.โ Id. at 1237.  And this factor is a weak factor that does not preclude dismissal where the\n26 other factors weigh in favor of dismissal. Rio Properties, Inc. v. Rio Intโl Interlink, 284 F.2d\n27 1007, 1022 (9th Cir. 2022).  Here, Plaintiff brought this case against Defendant Clawson, and\n28 thus, he has the responsibility to diligently prosecute the case and move the case forward toward\n7\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 10 of 14\n1 its disposition. See Morris v. Morgan & Co., 942 F.2d at 652.  His failure to comply with the\n2 Courtโs orders to appear for and submit to an oral deposition stalls the resolution of the case and\n3 prevents Defendant Clawson from understanding the merits of Plaintiffโs claim.  Therefore,\n4 Plaintiff cannot avail himself of this factor.\n5 D. The Fifth FactorโWhether Alternative Sanctions Are Available, and\nWhether Plaintiff Received a WarningโWeighs In Favor of Dismissal.\n6\n7 Evaluation of the last factorโthe availability of less drastic sanctionsโis satisfied through\n8 the district courtโs โreasonable exploration of possible and meaningful alternatives.โ Morris, 942\n9 F.2d at 652.  Warning a party that failure to obey a court order will result in dismissal can itself\n10 meet the โconsideration of alternativesโ requirement. In re PPA, 460 F.3d at 1229.\n11 Here, the Court has warned Plaintiff, twice, of the possible dismissal of this case through its\n12 order compelling Plaintiffโs deposition.  (ECF No. 67, 75.)  In its order granting Defendantโs\n13 motion to compel, this court stated: โ[u]nless Plaintiff prefers the more severe sanction of\n14 dismissal of this entire action for his refusal to appear for the deposition under Rule\n15 37(b)(2)(A)(v) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, he shall appear for and submit to an oral\n16 deposition on February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. as he has been noticed by Defendantโs counsel.โ\n17 (ECF No. 67 at 4.)  Plaintiff acknowledged receiving this order before the deposition, and defense\n18 counsel read the relevant portion of the order to Plaintiff on February 9, 2023.  (Pl.โs Depo at\n19 9:11-16:7.)  Still, Plaintiff refused to answer questions.  (Id.)\n20 Then, in its order denying Defendantโs motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice,\n21 this Court admonished Plaintiff โthat his failure to appear and answer questions in good faith will\n22 result in terminating sanctions and the award or reasonable fees and costs to Defendantโs\n23 counsel.โ  (ECF No. 88 at 5.)  Defendant Clawson also served Plaintiff with an additional copy of\n24 the order, and inquired about Plaintiffโs medical needs so that they could be accommodated\n25 during his deposition.  (Shryock Decl., ยถยถ 5-6, Exhs. 1-2.)  While Plaintiff acknowledged\n26 receiving both the Courtโs order and Defendantโs letter, he never responded, and he deliberately\n27 prevented the deposition from going forward.  (See Shryock Decl., ยถ 9, Exh. 3.)  This is after\n28\n8\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 11 of 14\n1 another one of his cases was dismissed for his repeated, willful refusal to sit for deposition.  (See\n2 Shryock Decl., Exhs. 4-5.).\n3 The threat of sanctions has not deterred Plaintiffโs behavior, nor did court orders gain his\n4 compliance.  Even the imposition of terminating sanctions in another matter has not changed\n5 Plaintiffโs behavior.  (See Shryock Decl., Exhs. 4-5.)  And monetary sanctions will not suffice.\n6 Because Plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis (ECF No. 6), monetary sanctions are not a\n7 viable alternative. See Jenkins v. Biter, 13-cv-02724 VBF (RZ), 2014 WL 11742143, *2 (C.D.\n8 Cal. 2014) (concluding same and compiling cases reaching similar conclusion).  Further,\n9 Defendant Clawson sought over $1,000 in sanctions for Plaintiffโs failure to appear for his initial\n10 deposition, and the threat of facing similar sanctions for his refusal to answer questions at his\n11 second deposition did not induce Plaintiff to cooperate.  (See Pl.โs Depo. at 15:6-16:7.)  Because\n12 Plaintiff was not deterred by the threat of monetary sanctions, and has been warned of the\n13 possibility of terminating sanctions if he continued to refuse to comply with this courtโs order on\n14 multiple occasions, nothing short of terminating this action with prejudice will deter Plaintiff\n15 from repeating his behavior.  The last factor, thus, weighs in favor of dismissal.\n16 Because the balance of factors support termination, this action should be dismissed with\n17 prejudice.\n18 II. DEFENDANTCLAWSONISALSOENTITLED TOMONETARYSANCTIONS.\n19 This court should also award Defendant Clawson attorneyโs fees and costs associated with\n20 his three attempts to depose Plaintiff to punish Plaintiffโs bad-faith conduct and deter such\n21 conduct in the future.\n22 In addition to imposing sanctions for a partyโs failure to appear for their deposition, a โcourt\n23 must require the party failing to act . . . to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorneyโs fees,\n24 caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an\n25 award of expenses unjust.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3).  A failure to appear need not be willful, but\n26 โwillfulnessโ plays a role in the choice of sanctions.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3), Advisory\n27 Committee Notes, 1970 Amendment.  And when making a bad-faith determination, the court is\n28 entitled to reply on the partyโs motivations and can consider the partyโs conduct in other cases.\n9\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 12 of 14\n1 See Halaco v. Engโg Co. v. Costle, 843 F.2d 376, 381 n.2 (9th Cir. 1988) (โcourt may indeed\n2 consider prior conduct that has already been subject to sanction, when it is weighing a subsequent\n3 sanction motionโ); see also Smith v. Smith, 145 F.3d 335, 344 (5th Cir. 1998).\n4 Here, Defendant Clawson requests the court award him his costs and attorneyโs feesโor\n5 some portion thereofโassociated with his second and third attempts to depose Plaintiff because\n6 Plaintiffโs conduct was not substantially justified, and other circumstances do not make such an\n7 award unjust. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3).  Plaintiff repeatedly refused to answer questions,\n8 despite being advised by the court and counsel that โ[t]he failure of Plaintiff to attend, be sworn,\n9 or answer appropriate questions may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the action\n10 pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37.โ  And this is not the first time Plaintiff has wasted court or party\n11 resources.  Plaintiff is a declared three-strikes litigant who has previously had at least one case\n12 dismissed for failure to comply with court orders and multiple appeals certified as frivolous.\n13 (ECF No. 75-2 at ยถยถ 18-20.)  If his obstructionist behavior is permitted to continue, he will only\n14 continue to waste the time of defendants and the courts in other cases.\n15 Defendant Clawson incurred $1,127.05 in costs, and $825 in attorneysโ fees, for a total of\n16 $1,952.05, in connection with his attempt to depose Plaintiff on February 9, 2023.  (ECF No. 75-2\n17 at ยถยถ 14-16.)  And Defendant Clawson incurred an additional $1,245.56 in costs, and $770 in\n18 attorneysโ fees, for a total of $2,015.56, in connection with his attempt to depose Plaintiff on\n19 October 4, 2023.  (Shryock Decl., ยถยถ 14-16.)  Because Plaintiffโs refusal to answer questions was\n20 not in good faith, Defendant Clawson is entitled to his costs and fees, for a total of $3,967.61, or\n21 some portion thereof.\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26 //\n27 //\n28 //\n10\nNot.

Despite multiple court orders and the courtโs\n5 and counselโs warnings that he may be subject to sanctionsโincluding the dismissal of this\n6 actionโPlaintiff initially refused to be sworn, and then insisted that he may be represented by\n7 counsel, as well as other untruths, to prevent his deposition from proceeding.  And he has been\n8 using the same tactics in his other pending litigation, including one case that was just dismissed\n9 for Plaintiff repeated, willful refusal to be deposed.  Because Plaintiff is a prolific litigator and\n10 declared three-strikes litigant, who is currently proceeding in forma pauperis, nothing short of\n11 terminating sanctions will stop his continued waste of party and judicial resources.  This court\n12 should dismiss the action with prejudice, and award Defendants costs and attorneysโ fees\n13 reasonably incurred in their second and third attempts to take Plaintiffโs deposition.\n14 BACKGROUND\n15 Plaintiff is a prolific litigator and declared three-strikes litigant with a history of filing\n16 frivolous litigant and refusing to comply with court orders.  (See ECF No. 75-2 at ยถยถ 18-20.)  In\n17 this action, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Clawson, a correctional officer at San Quentin State\n18 Prison, utilized excessive force against Plaintiff when Defendant Clawson discharged a sponge\n19 round at Plaintiffโs lower extremities, while Plaintiff was engaged in a fight with multiple\n20 inmates.  (ECF No. 29 at 4.)  But Plaintiff has now thrice prevented Defendant Clawson from\n21 asking Plaintiff questions about his allegations.\n22 A. Plaintiff Refused to Be Deposed on November 17, 2022.\n23 Defendant Clawson initially noticed Plaintiffโs deposition for November 17, 2022.  (ECF\n24 No. 63-2 at 1-2.)  Between the date the deposition notice was served and the date of the\n25 deposition, defense counsel did not receive any communication from Plaintiff, let alone any\n26 objection to the taking of his deposition.  (Id. at 2.)  However, on November 17, 2022, Plaintiff\n27 refused to be transported to the deposition location.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Plaintiff demanded various\n28 accommodations before he would agree to be transported, but correctional staff reviewed\n1\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 4 of 14\n1 Plaintiffโs electronic prison file and determined that he was not entitled to any of the demanded\n2 accommodations.  (Id.)  Because Plaintiff would not agree to be transported to the deposition\n3 without those accommodations, the deposition could not proceed and was suspended.  (Id.)\n4 Defendant Clawson incurred $1,108.25 in costs and fees associated with his attempt to\n5 depose Plaintiff on November 17, 2022.  (Id. at 3.)\n6 B. Plaintiff Was Ordered to Appear for and Submit to an Oral Deposition on\nFebruary 9, 2023, but Again Refused.\n7\n8 Defendant Clawson moved to compel Plaintiffโs deposition, and re-noticed Plaintiffโs\n9 deposition for February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m.1  (ECF No. 63; ECF No. 75-2 at ยถ 3.)  Plaintiff\n10 opposed the motion to compel, and in his opposition he requested the appointment of counsel.\n11 (ECF No. 65.)  The court granted Defendantโs motion to compel, admonishing Plaintiff that\n12 unless he โprefers the more severe sanction of dismissal of this entire action for his refusal to\n13 appear for the deposition under Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(v) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, he\n14 shall appear for and submit to an oral deposition on February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. as he has been\n15 noticed by Defendantโs counsel.โ  (ECF No. 67 at 4.)  In the same order, the court denied\n16 Plaintiffโs request for appointment of counsel, noting the court had already denied multiple\n17 requests by Plaintiff and explaining that โ[p]reparing for a deposition is not an exceptional\n18 circumstance that warrants the appointment of counsel.โ  (Id.)\n19 Therefore, on February 9, 2023, defense counsel appeared in person for Plaintiffโs\n20 deposition.  (ECF No. 75-2 at ยถ 7.)  Plaintiff appeared, was swornโthough he objected to taking\n21 the oathโand stated his name for the record.  (ECF No. 75-3, Exh. 4 at 5:1-25.)  But after that,\n22 Plaintiff refused to answer questions.  (See id. at 6:1-16:7.)  Plaintiff objected that he risked\n23 โwaiving an objection provided by the errors and irregularities occurring at the oral deposition โฆ\n24 in the manner of taking the deposition in a form of questions and answers[,] in the oath or\n25 affirmation[,] or in the conduct of the parties and errors of any kind[,] which might be obviated or\n26 removed or cured if promptly presented or waived unless suitable objection thereto was made at\n27 the taking of the deposition.โ  (Id. at 6:2-16.)  Plaintiff went on to object that he could not proceed\n28 1 He also moved for monetary sanctions, which were denied.  (SeeECF Nos. 63, 67.)\n2\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 5 of 14\n1 because he โdid not have the assistance of counsel and absence,โ and could not โmake\n2 uncounseled responses.โ  (Id.)  Plaintiff also objected that he was not prepared due to several\n3 medical issues,โ but would identify the medical issues.  (Id. at 7:1-25.)\n4 Defense counsel presented Plaintiff with a copy of the courtโs order granting Defendantโs\n5 motion to compel, and Plaintiff acknowledged receiving the order and acknowledged that he\n6 understood his deposition testimony had been compelled.  (Id. at 9:11-12:13.)  Defense counsel\n7 read Plaintiff the portion of the order in which the court advised Plaintiff that if he did not appear\n8 for and submit to an oral deposition, the action could be terminated, and later orally advised\n9 Plaintiff that his failure to answer questions could result in monetary and/or terminating\n10 sanctions.  (Id. at 9:11-16:7.)  But Plaintiff just repeated his objection about the risk of waiving\n11 the โerrors and irregularitiesโ with the deposition if he proceeded without counsel, confirmed that\n12 objection would be his response to every question posed, and reiterated that he would not answer\n13 questions without the assistance of counsel.  (Id.)  The deposition was then suspended.  (Id.)\n14 C. Defendant Moved for Terminating Sanctions, Which Were Denied, But\nPlaintiff Was Afforded a Final Opportunity to Sit for and Participate in\n15 His Deposition.\n16 Defendant Clawson sought terminating and monetary sanctions for Plaintiffโs repeated\n17 refusal to participate in his deposition.  (ECF No. 75.)  This Court found Defendantโs motion\n18 โpersuasive,โ but โin the interest of justice and his pro se status,โ the Court denied the motion\n19 without prejudice so that Plaintiff could be afforded โone final opportunity to comply and submit\n20 to an oral deposition, which includes making a good faith effort to answer all questions posed by\n21 Defendantโs counsel.โ  (ECF No. 88 at 5.)  Plaintiff was warned that โhis failure to appear and\n22 answer questions in good faith will result in terminating sanctions and the award or reasonable\n23 fees and costs to Defendantโs counsel.โ  (Id. at 5.)\n24 Defendant Clawson noticed Plaintiffโs deposition for October 4, 2023, at 10:00 a.m.\n25 (Shryock Decl., ยถ 5.)  Defendant Clawson served Plaintiff with notice of the deposition on\n26 September 11, 2023, and simultaneously served Plaintiff with an additional copy of the courtโs\n27 order (ECF No. 88), and offering to accommodate any medical needs Plaintiff had.  (Shryock\n28\n3\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot.

Between September 11 and October 4, 2023, defense counsel did not\n2 receive any communications from Plaintiff.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 6.)\n3 D. Plaintiff Prevented His Deposition from Proceeding on October 4, 2023.\n4 On October 4, 2023, defense counsel again traveled to San Quentin State Prison to depose\n5 Plaintiff.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 7.)  However, Plaintiff initially refused to be sworn on various\n6 grounds, including a religious objection, claiming not to understand the oath, and because he was\n7 in the process of obtaining counsel.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 8, Exh. 3 at 6:8-9:9.)  Plaintiff later was\n8 sworn, but he objected to being placed under oath, claiming he was under โduressโ because of the\n9 courtโs orders.  (Shryock Decl., Exh. 3 at 14:13-16:19.)  Plaintiff acknowledged receiving the\n10 amended notice of deposition, as well as counselโs letter about requesting accommodations for\n11 the deposition.  (Id. at 11:3-13:22.)  Plaintiff admitted he never responded to either.  (Id.)\n12 Plaintiff maintainedโDefendant contends erroneouslyโthat he โmay beโ represented by\n13 counsel because he had corresponded with multiple attorneys about taking his case.  (Id. at 9:10-\n14 10:22, 13:11-22, 17:14-18:5.)  But Plaintiffโs most recent communication with an attorney about\n15 potentially taking his case was a letter dated July 2023.  (Id.)  Based upon Plaintiffโs\n16 representation that he โdid not knowโ whether he was represented by counsel and that he โmay\n17 beโ represented, counsel did not believe she could proceed with the deposition, and therefore\n18 suspended the deposition at that time.  (Shryock Decl., ยถ 11, Exh. 3 at 17:14-18:21.)\n19 Defendant Clawson now renews his motion for terminating sanctions.\n20 DISCUSSION\n21 I. THECOURTSHOULDTERMINATETHISACTION WITHPREJUDICE FORPLAINTIFFโS\nREPEATEDFAILURE TOCOOPERATE INDISCOVERY ANDCOMPLY WITHCOURT\n22 ORDERS.\n23 Plaintiffโs repeated, willful refusal to sit for and submit to deposition warrants terminating\n24 sanctions.  District courts have the inherent power to control their dockets, and โin the exercise of\n25 that power they may impose sanctions including dismissal of a case.โ Thompson v. Housing\n26 Auth., 782 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir. 1986).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A)(v),\n27 district courts are empowered to dismiss an action if a party fails to obey an order to provide or\n28 permit discovery.  Similarly, Rule 41(b) expressly authorizes dismissals for failure to comply\n4\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 7 of 14\n1 with a court order.  The standards governing dismissals under these two rules are โbasically the\n2 same.โ Malone v. U.S. Postal Serv., 833 F.2d 128, 130 (9th Cir. 1987) (reviewing dismissal\n3 under Rules 37 and 41).\n4 In determining if dismissal is the appropriate sanction, courts weigh five factors: (1) the\n5 public interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the courtโs need to manage its docket; (3)\n6 the risk of prejudice to the defendants; (4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their\n7 merits; (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions. Pagtalunan v. Galaza, 291 F.3d 639, 641\n8 (9th Cir. 1986).  Although it is preferred, it is not required that the district court make explicit\n9 findings to show that it has considered these factors. Yourish v. Cal. Amplifier, 191 F.3d 983, 990\n10 (9th Cir. 1999).  These factors are tools of analysis, not โconditions precedentโ to the district\n11 courtโs imposition of sanctions. Allen v. Bayer Corp. (In re PPA), 460 F.3d 1217, 1226 (9th Cir.\n12 2006).  Here, the factors weigh in favor of terminating sanctions.\n13 A. The First and Second Factorsโthe Public Interest in Expeditious\nResolution and Management of the Courtโs DocketโWeigh in Favor of\n14 Dismissal.\n15 The first two factorsโexpeditious resolution and the Courtโs docket managementโalways\n16 weigh in favor of dismissal. Malone, 833 F.2d at 130-31.  The public has โan overriding interestโ\n17 in the orderly, expeditious, and inexpensive determination of every action. In re PPA, 460 F.3d at\n18 1227.  Delay in reaching the merits is โcostly in money, memory, manageability, and confidence\n19 in the process.โ Id. at 1227.  Although cases generally should be disposed of on their merits, a\n20 plaintiff is responsible for moving his case toward that disposition. See Morris v. Morgan Stanley\n21 & Co., 942 F.2d 648, 652 (9th Cir. 1991).  The power to invoke terminating sanctions โis\n22 necessary in order to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases and to avoid\n23 congestion in the calendars of the district courts.โ Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 371 U.S. 626, 629 โ\n24 30 (1962).\n25 Here, Plaintiffโs repeated and willful refusal to submit to depositionโin contravention of\n26 two court ordersโis impeding the advancement of this case.  This action was filed on September\n27 11, 2018.  (ECF No. 1.)  Yet, five years later, Defendant cannot determine whether a dispositive\n28 motion is appropriate, or prepare one, until he has deposed Plaintiff.  And Plaintiff has prevented\n5\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 8 of 14\n1 him from doing that for almost one year.  (See ECF Nos. 62, 75.)  Plaintiffโs deposition was\n2 initially noticed for November 2022, but Plaintiff refused to be transported to the deposition\n3 location.  (See ECF No. 62.)  The court ordered Plaintiff to sit for deposition in February, and\n4 extended Defendantsโ deadline to file a summary-judgment motion.  (See ECF No. 67 at 4.)  But\n5 Plaintiff again refused to answer questions.  (ECF No. 75-3, Exh. 4.)  This Court then gave\n6 Plaintiff โone, final opportunityโ to answer Defendant Clawsonโs questions, but Plaintiff againโ\n7 for a third timeโimpeded Defendantโs ability to ask Plaintiff questions about this case.  (ECF\n8 No. 88 at 5.)  Plaintiffโs refusal to sit for deposition has resulted in no less than three motions\n9 being brought, and has extended discovery by one year.  Further, there is no indication that\n10 Plaintiff intends to change his behavior.  He recently had another case dismissed for his repeated\n11 refusal to sit for deposition (Shryock Decl., Exhs. 4-5), and yet in this and one other pending case\n12 he continues to refuse to be deposed unless he is represented by counsel.  (Shryock Dec., ยถ 19,\n13 Exh. 3.)\n14 Plaintiffโs behavior impedes the Courtโs strong interest in docket control and expeditious\n15 resolution of cases.  These factors weigh in favor of dismissal.\n16 B. The Third FactorโPrejudice to DefendantsโAlso Weighs in Favor of\nDismissal.\n17\n18 Defendant Clawson has been and continues to be prejudiced by Plaintiffโs refusal to sit for\n19 deposition and answer questions about his claim. See Adriana Intโl Corp. v. Thoeren, 913 F.2d\n20 1406, 1412 (9th Cir. 1990).  Prejudice may take the form of loss of evidence, loss of memory, and\n21 costs or burdens of litigation. In re PPA, 460 F.3d at 1338.  The law also presumes that an\n22 unreasonable delay causes prejudice. Anderson v. Air West Inc., 542 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir.\n23 1976).  Courts have interpreted Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) to require a plaintiff to\n24 prosecute with โreasonable diligenceโ to avoid dismissal. Id.  The failure to prosecute diligently\n25 is โsufficient by itself to justify dismissal, even in the absence of showing actual prejudice to the\n26 defendant from the failure.โ Id.\n27\n28\n6\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 9 of 14\n1 First, Defendant is prejudiced because he cannot defend against Plaintiffโs claim because he\n2 has not been able to ask Plaintiff about the facts that form the basis of that claim.  If Defendant\n3 Clawson cannot ask questions about the allegations against him, he cannot properly evaluate the\n4 claims against him or determine whether possible defenses are viable.  (ECF No. 75-2 at ยถ 17.)\n5 Thus, at this time, Defendant Clawson cannot prepare a summary-judgment motionโor even\n6 determine if such a motion is warrantedโor prepare a defense for trial.  (Id.)  Defendant Clawson\n7 is also prejudiced by the cost of repeatedly preparing for and attempting to depose Plaintiff, and\n8 bringing multiple discovery and extension motions before the court.  (See, e.g., ECF Nos. 63, 63-\n9 2 at 3; 75-2.)  Defendant Clawson incurred no less than $1,108.25 for his attempt to depose\n10 Plaintiff in November 2022, and he incurred an additional $1,952.05 and $2,015.56 in fees and\n11 costs in connection with Plaintiffโs (failed) February 9 and October 4, 2023, depositions.  (ECF\n12 No. 75-2 at ยถยถ 14-16; Shryock Decl., ยถยถ 13-15.)  And these costs are only a fraction of the costs\n13 Defendant Clawson actually incurred.  (See id.)\n14 Second, Plaintiffโs behavior has unreasonably delayed this action, and (after five years\n15 since Plaintiffโs allegations occurred), this leads to evidence loss, witness loss, and memory loss,\n16 all of which are prejudicial to Defendant Clawson.  And Plaintiffโs conduct is antithetical to his\n17 duty to prosecute his case.  The third factor favors dismissal.\n18 C. The Fourth FactorโPublic Policy Favoring a Merits DecisionโDoes Not\nFavor Dismissal, But Also Does Not Preclude It.\n19\n20 The only factor that weighs against dismissal is the public policy favoring disposition on\n21 the merits. In re PPA, 460 F.2d at 1228.  But โthis factor lends little support to a party whose\n22 responsibility is to move the case toward disposition on the merits but whose conduct impedes\n23 progress in that direction.โ Id. (internal quotations omitted).  Plaintiffโs error in โhalting\n24 movement towards a merits solutionโ should โsubstantially neutralize[] the negative effect of this\n25 factor.โ Id. at 1237.  And this factor is a weak factor that does not preclude dismissal where the\n26 other factors weigh in favor of dismissal. Rio Properties, Inc. v. Rio Intโl Interlink, 284 F.2d\n27 1007, 1022 (9th Cir. 2022).  Here, Plaintiff brought this case against Defendant Clawson, and\n28 thus, he has the responsibility to diligently prosecute the case and move the case forward toward\n7\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 10 of 14\n1 its disposition. See Morris v. Morgan & Co., 942 F.2d at 652.  His failure to comply with the\n2 Courtโs orders to appear for and submit to an oral deposition stalls the resolution of the case and\n3 prevents Defendant Clawson from understanding the merits of Plaintiffโs claim.  Therefore,\n4 Plaintiff cannot avail himself of this factor.\n5 D. The Fifth FactorโWhether Alternative Sanctions Are Available, and\nWhether Plaintiff Received a WarningโWeighs In Favor of Dismissal.\n6\n7 Evaluation of the last factorโthe availability of less drastic sanctionsโis satisfied through\n8 the district courtโs โreasonable exploration of possible and meaningful alternatives.โ Morris, 942\n9 F.2d at 652.  Warning a party that failure to obey a court order will result in dismissal can itself\n10 meet the โconsideration of alternativesโ requirement. In re PPA, 460 F.3d at 1229.\n11 Here, the Court has warned Plaintiff, twice, of the possible dismissal of this case through its\n12 order compelling Plaintiffโs deposition.  (ECF No. 67, 75.)  In its order granting Defendantโs\n13 motion to compel, this court stated: โ[u]nless Plaintiff prefers the more severe sanction of\n14 dismissal of this entire action for his refusal to appear for the deposition under Rule\n15 37(b)(2)(A)(v) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, he shall appear for and submit to an oral\n16 deposition on February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. as he has been noticed by Defendantโs counsel.โ\n17 (ECF No. 67 at 4.)  Plaintiff acknowledged receiving this order before the deposition, and defense\n18 counsel read the relevant portion of the order to Plaintiff on February 9, 2023.  (Pl.โs Depo at\n19 9:11-16:7.)  Still, Plaintiff refused to answer questions.  (Id.)\n20 Then, in its order denying Defendantโs motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice,\n21 this Court admonished Plaintiff โthat his failure to appear and answer questions in good faith will\n22 result in terminating sanctions and the award or reasonable fees and costs to Defendantโs\n23 counsel.โ  (ECF No. 88 at 5.)  Defendant Clawson also served Plaintiff with an additional copy of\n24 the order, and inquired about Plaintiffโs medical needs so that they could be accommodated\n25 during his deposition.  (Shryock Decl., ยถยถ 5-6, Exhs. 1-2.)  While Plaintiff acknowledged\n26 receiving both the Courtโs order and Defendantโs letter, he never responded, and he deliberately\n27 prevented the deposition from going forward.  (See Shryock Decl., ยถ 9, Exh. 3.)  This is after\n28\n8\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot. Terminating & Monetary Sanctions (5:18-cv-05558-BLF (PR))\n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF     Document 91     Filed 10/18/23     Page 11 of 14\n1 another one of his cases was dismissed for his repeated, willful refusal to sit for deposition.  (See\n2 Shryock Decl., Exhs. 4-5.).\n3 The threat of sanctions has not deterred Plaintiffโs behavior, nor did court orders gain his\n4 compliance.  Even the imposition of terminating sanctions in another matter has not changed\n5 Plaintiffโs behavior.  (See Shryock Decl., Exhs. 4-5.)  And monetary sanctions will not suffice.\n6 Because Plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis (ECF No. 6), monetary sanctions are not a\n7 viable alternative. See Jenkins v. Biter, 13-cv-02724 VBF (RZ), 2014 WL 11742143, *2 (C.D.\n8 Cal. 2014) (concluding same and compiling cases reaching similar conclusion).  Further,\n9 Defendant Clawson sought over $1,000 in sanctions for Plaintiffโs failure to appear for his initial\n10 deposition, and the threat of facing similar sanctions for his refusal to answer questions at his\n11 second deposition did not induce Plaintiff to cooperate.  (See Pl.โs Depo. at 15:6-16:7.)  Because\n12 Plaintiff was not deterred by the threat of monetary sanctions, and has been warned of the\n13 possibility of terminating sanctions if he continued to refuse to comply with this courtโs order on\n14 multiple occasions, nothing short of terminating this action with prejudice will deter Plaintiff\n15 from repeating his behavior.  The last factor, thus, weighs in favor of dismissal.\n16 Because the balance of factors support termination, this action should be dismissed with\n17 prejudice.\n18 II. DEFENDANTCLAWSONISALSOENTITLED TOMONETARYSANCTIONS.\n19 This court should also award Defendant Clawson attorneyโs fees and costs associated with\n20 his three attempts to depose Plaintiff to punish Plaintiffโs bad-faith conduct and deter such\n21 conduct in the future.\n22 In addition to imposing sanctions for a partyโs failure to appear for their deposition, a โcourt\n23 must require the party failing to act . . . to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorneyโs fees,\n24 caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an\n25 award of expenses unjust.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3).  A failure to appear need not be willful, but\n26 โwillfulnessโ plays a role in the choice of sanctions.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3), Advisory\n27 Committee Notes, 1970 Amendment.  And when making a bad-faith determination, the court is\n28 entitled to reply on the partyโs motivations and can consider the partyโs conduct in other cases.\n9\nNot. Mot. & Renewed Mot.

Costle, 843 F.2d 376, 381 n.2 (9th Cir. 1988) (โcourt may indeed\n2 consider prior conduct that has already been subject to sanction, when it is weighing a subsequent\n3 sanction motionโ); see also Smith v. Smith, 145 F.3d 335, 344 (5th Cir. 1998).\n4 Here, Defendant Clawson requests the court award him his costs and attorneyโs feesโor\n5 some portion thereofโassociated with his second and third attempts to depose Plaintiff because\n6 Plaintiffโs conduct was not substantially justified, and other circumstances do not make such an\n7 award unjust. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3).  Plaintiff repeatedly refused to answer questions,\n8 despite being advised by the court and counsel that โ[t]he failure of Plaintiff to attend, be sworn,\n9 or answer appropriate questions may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the action\n10 pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37.โ  And this is not the first time Plaintiff has wasted court or party\n11 resources.  Plaintiff is a declared three-strikes litigant who has previously had at least one case\n12 dismissed for failure to comply with court orders and multiple appeals certified as frivolous.\n13 (ECF No. 75-2 at ยถยถ 18-20.)  If his obstructionist behavior is permitted to continue, he will only\n14 continue to waste the time of defendants and the courts in other cases.\n15 Defendant Clawson incurred $1,127.05 in costs, and $825 in attorneysโ fees, for a total of\n16 $1,952.05, in connection with his attempt to depose Plaintiff on February 9, 2023.  (ECF No. 75-2\n17 at ยถยถ 14-16.)

Plaintiffโs motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis will be addressed \n20  in a separate order.      \n21  DISCUSSION \n22  A.  Standard of Review \n23    A federal court must conduct a preliminary screening in any case in which a \n24  prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a \n25  governmental entity.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(a).  In its review, the court must identify any \n26  cognizable claims and dismiss any claims that are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim \n27  upon which relief may be granted or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune \n28  from such relief.  See id. ยง 1915A(b)(1),(2).  Pro se pleadings must, however, be liberally \n\n \n \n1  construed.  See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).   \n2    To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a plaintiff must allege two essential \n3  elements: (1) that a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States was \n4  violated, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under the \n5  color of state law.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n6  B.  Plaintiffโs Claims  \n7  Plaintiff alleges several claims against different individuals at SQSP based on \n8  separate incidents that occurred on different dates during July, August and September \n9  2018.  (Compl. at 3-11.)  For example, he claims that on or about August 2, 2018, \n10  Defendant Officer Malikian threatened him in retaliation for filing inmate appeals.  (Id. at \n11  5.)  Plaintiff also claims that his request for various religious accommodations on July 31, \n12  2018, has gone unanswered, and that he has been experiencing ongoing restrictions in \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  practicing his Muslim faith.  (Id. at 6.)  Plaintiff also claims that on August 14, 2018, he \nCif\nct Cal 14  was attacked by inmates, and thereafter received inadequate medical treatment for his \nstriof \nDict  15  various injuries and experienced other constitutional deprivations stemming from that \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  incident the failure to treat.  (Id. at 7-8.)  Plaintiff also claims denial of access to the prison \nS \ned ern 17  law library on August 28, 2018, (id. at 9), and interference with his legal mail on August \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  30, 2018, (id. at 11).   \n19  โA party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, \n20  as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party.โ  \n21  Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a).  Accordingly, โmultiple claims against a single party are fine, but \n22  Claim A against Defendant 1 should not be joined with unrelated Claim B against \n23  Defendant 2.โ  George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007).  โUnrelated claims \n24  against different defendants belong in different suits,โ not only to prevent the sort of \n25  โmorassโ that a multi-claim, multi-defendant suit can produce, โbut also to ensure that \n26  prisoners pay the required filing fees โ for the Prison Litigation Reform Act limits to 3 the \n27  number of frivolous suits or appeals that any prisoner may file without prepayment of \n28  2 \n\n \n \n1  required fees.โ  Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(g)).   \n2  Here, it is clear the various claims raised against different defendants at SQSP are \n3  not all related to each other and do not all arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or \n4  series of transactions or occurrences.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2).  โA buckshot complaint that \n5  would be rejected if filed by a free person โ say, a suit complaining that A defrauded \n6  plaintiff, B defamed him, C punched him, D failed to pay a debt, and E infringed his \n7  copyright, all in different transactions โ should be rejected if filed by a prisoner.โ  George \n8  v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) (noting that, in prisoner complaint seeking to \n9  join 24 defendants and approximately 50 distinct claims, prisoner made no effort to show \n10  that 24 defendants he named had participated in the same transaction or series of \n11  transactions or that a question of fact is common to all defendants).  Accordingly, the \n12  Court finds that the claims against the named SQSP Defendants are improperly joined in \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  this single action.  In the interest of justice, Plaintiff shall be granted leave to file an \nCif\nct Cal 14  amended complaint containing only related claims against the appropriate Defendants.   \nstriof \nDict  15  C.    Motion for Appointment of Counsel \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Plaintiff has filed a motion for appointment of counsel based on indigency, the \nS \ned ern 17  complexity of the issues, limited access to library and knowledge of the law, and that he \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  would be better served by the assistance of counsel should this matter go to trial.  (Docket \n19  No. 4.)   However, there is no constitutional right to counsel in a civil case unless an \n20  indigent litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.  See Lassiter v. \n21  Depโt of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 25 (1981); Rand v. Rowland, 113 F.3d 1520, 1525 \n22  (9th Cir. 1997) (no constitutional right to counsel in ยง 1983 action), withdrawn in part on \n23  other grounds on rehโg en banc, 154 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc).  The decision to \n24  request counsel to represent an indigent litigant under ยง 1915 is within โthe sound \n25  discretion of the trial court and is granted only in exceptional circumstances.โ Franklin v. \n26  Murphy, 745 F.2d 1221, 1236 (9th Cir. 1984).  Plaintiffโs asserted grounds do not establish \n27  exceptional circumstances.  Accordingly, the motion is DENIED for lack of exceptional \n28  3 \n\n \n \n1  circumstances.  See Agyeman v. Corrections Corp. of America, 390 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th \n2  Cir. 2004); Rand, 113 F.3d at 1525 (9th Cir. 1997); Terrell v. Brewer, 935 F.2d 1015, 1017 \n3  (9th Cir. 1991); Wilborn v. Escalderon, 789 F.2d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1986).  This denial \n4  is without prejudice to the Courtโs sua sponte appointment of counsel at a future date \n5  should the circumstances of this case warrant such appointment. \n6     \n7  CONCLUSION \n8  For the foregoing reasons, the Court orders as follows:  \n9    The complaint is DISMISSED with leave to amend.  Within twenty-eight  \n10  (28) days of the date this order is filed, Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint that \n11  complies with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The \n12  amended complaint must include the caption and civil case number used in this order, Case \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  No. C 18-05558 BLF (PR), and the words โAMENDED COMPLAINTโ on the first page.  \nCif\nct Cal 14  If using the court form complaint, Plaintiff must answer all the questions on the form in \nstriof \nDict  15  order for the action to proceed.   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    The amended complaint supersedes the original, the latter being treated thereafter as \nS \ned ern 17  non-existent.  Ramirez v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 806 F.3d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir. 2015).  \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  Consequently, claims not included in an amended complaint are no longer claims and \n19  defendants not named in an amended complaint are no longer defendants.  See Ferdik v. \n20  Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th Cir.1992).   \n21  Failure to respond in accordance with this order in the time provided will \n22  result in the dismissal of this action without prejudice and without further notice to \n23  Plaintiff.   \n24  The Clerk shall include two copies of the courtโs complaint with a copy of this \n25  order to Plaintiff.   \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  4 \n\n \n \n1  This order terminates Docket No. 4. \n2  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n3  Dated:  _____________________    ________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n4 \nUnited States District Judge \n \n5 \n \n \n6 \n \n \n7   \n \n \n8   \n \n9   \n \n \n10   \n \n \n11 \n \n \n12   \nrt a ni   \nur\noo 13   \nct CCalif 14    \nstriof    \nDict  15   \ns ri  \net\ntatDis 16    \ned Sern  17    \nUnitorth   \nN 18   \n \n \n19 \n \n \n20   \n \n \n21 \n \n \n22   \n \n \n23   \n \n \n24 \n \n \n25  Order of DWLTA; Denying Mot. for Appt. of Counsel \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_dwlta.atty \n26 \n27 \n28  5 ",

(Docket \n19  No. 4.)   However, there is no constitutional right to counsel in a civil case unless an \n20  indigent litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.  See Lassiter v. \n21  Depโt of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 25 (1981); Rand v. Rowland, 113 F.3d 1520, 1525 \n22  (9th Cir. 1997) (no constitutional right to counsel in ยง 1983 action), withdrawn in part on \n23  other grounds on rehโg en banc, 154 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc).  The decision to \n24  request counsel to represent an indigent litigant under ยง 1915 is within โthe sound \n25  discretion of the trial court and is granted only in exceptional circumstances.โ Franklin v. \n26  Murphy, 745 F.2d 1221, 1236 (9th Cir. 1984).  Plaintiffโs asserted grounds do not establish \n27  exceptional circumstances.  Accordingly, the motion is DENIED for lack of exceptional \n28  3 \n\n \n \n1  circumstances.  See Agyeman v. Corrections Corp. of America, 390 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th \n2  Cir. 2004); Rand, 113 F.3d at 1525 (9th Cir. 1997); Terrell v. Brewer, 935 F.2d 1015, 1017 \n3  (9th Cir. 1991); Wilborn v. Escalderon, 789 F.2d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1986).  This denial \n4  is without prejudice to the Courtโs sua sponte appointment of counsel at a future date \n5  should the circumstances of this case warrant such appointment. \n6     \n7  CONCLUSION \n8  For the foregoing reasons, the Court orders as follows:  \n9    The complaint is DISMISSED with leave to amend.  Within twenty-eight  \n10  (28) days of the date this order is filed, Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint that \n11  complies with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The \n12  amended complaint must include the caption and civil case number used in this order, Case \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  No. C 18-05558 BLF (PR), and the words โAMENDED COMPLAINTโ on the first page.  \nCif\nct Cal 14  If using the court form complaint, Plaintiff must answer all the questions on the form in \nstriof \nDict  15  order for the action to proceed.   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    The amended complaint supersedes the original, the latter being treated thereafter as \nS \ned ern 17  non-existent.  Ramirez v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 806 F.3d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir. 2015).  \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  Consequently, claims not included in an amended complaint are no longer claims and \n19  defendants not named in an amended complaint are no longer defendants.  See Ferdik v. \n20  Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th Cir.1992).   \n21  Failure to respond in accordance with this order in the time provided will \n22  result in the dismissal of this action without prejudice and without further notice to \n23  Plaintiff.   \n24  The Clerk shall include two copies of the courtโs complaint with a copy of this \n25  order to Plaintiff.   \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  4 \n\n \n \n1  This order terminates Docket No. 4. \n2  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n3  Dated:  _____________________    ________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n4 \nUnited States District Judge \n \n5 \n \n \n6 \n \n \n7   \n \n \n8   \n \n9   \n \n \n10   \n \n \n11 \n \n \n12   \nrt a ni   \nur\noo 13   \nct CCalif 14    \nstriof    \nDict  15   \ns ri  \net\ntatDis 16    \ned Sern  17    \nUnitorth   \nN 18   \n \n \n19 \n \n \n20   \n \n \n21 \n \n \n22   \n \n \n23   \n \n \n24 \n \n \n25  Order of DWLTA; Denying Mot. for Appt. of Counsel \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_dwlta.atty \n26 \n27 \n28  5 ",

The Court found the second amended complaint, Dkt. No. 19 (hereinafter \n20 \nโSACโ), stated a cognizable claim for failure to protect under the Eighth Amendment and \n21 \nordered the matter served on Defendant Correctional Officer Clawson at the San Quentin \n22 \nState Prison.1  Dkt. No. 22.  Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint on March 6, 2020, \n23 \nDkt. No. 29, following Defendant Clawsonโs filing of a motion to dismiss on March 2, \n24 \n2020, Dkt. No. 27.  Defendant Clawson filed notice conceding that since Plaintiff is \n25 \npermitted to amend his complaint as a matter of course within twenty-one days of their \n26 \n \n27 \n1 The Court dismissed all other claims and defendants from this action for failure to state a \nclaim, as well as failure to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n28 \nProcedure.  Dkt. No. 22 at 3-4.   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 39   Filed 04/23/20   Page 2 of 4\n \n \n1  motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B), Plaintiffโs third amended \n2  complaint is now the operative complaint and Defendantโs motion to dismiss the second \n3  amended complaint is rendered moot.  Dkt. No. 31.  Accordingly, Plaintiffโs motion to \n4  amend is DENIED as unnecessary, Dkt. No. 26, and the third amended complaint is the \n5  operative complaint in this matter under Rule 15(a)(1)(B).  Dkt. No. 29.  Defendantโs \n6  motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is DENIED as moot.  Dkt. No. 27.  The \n7  Court addresses other pending motions below.   \n8   \n9  DISCUSSION \n10  A.   Motions Re Appointment of Counsel \n11  The Court denied each of Plaintiffโs three motions for appointment of counsel for \n12  lack of exceptional circumstances, with the last order filed on August 26, 2019.  Dkt. Nos. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  7, 12, 21.  On January 15, 2020, Plaintiff filed another motion to appoint counsel, Dkt. No. \nCfi\n tclaC 14  24, and a motion for reconsideration of the last court order denying appointment of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  counsel, Dkt. No. 30.  Although titled differently, these two motions essentially assert the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  same arguments.  Plaintiff additionally requests a preliminary injunction and a court order \nS de nre 17  for prison officials to โcease and desist violence, harassment and retaliation to interefer[e] \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  with plaintiffโs civil action.โ  Dkt. No. 24 at 2; Dkt. No. 30 at 2.  Plaintiff is currently \n19  being housed at Corcoran State Prison (โCSPโ), which is not a party to this action.  \n20  Accordingly, the Court has no jurisdiction over CSP or any of its employees in this action \n21  to issue an injunctive order against them.  Plaintiff must file any new claims against CSP \n22  employees in a separate civil rights action.   \n23  Plaintiff asserts the following grounds for appointment of counsel: lack of legal \n24  material and access to the law library and legal assistance, and the need for assistance to \n25  conduct discovery.  Dkt. No. 24 at 4-7; Dkt. No. 30 at 4-7.  The Court notes that despite \n26  the challenges he alleges, Plaintiff managed to file another motion to amend the complaint \n27  and the proposed third amended complaint.  Dkt. Nos. 26, 29.  With respect to discovery, \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 39   Filed 04/23/20   Page 3 of 4\n \n \n1  Plaintiff recently filed a motion requesting more time to conduct discovery to oppose \n2  Defendantโs motion which is generally articulate and organized.  Dkt. No. 33.  \n3  Accordingly, the motions for appointment of counsel and for reconsideration are DENIED \n4  for lack of changed circumstances.  See Agyeman v. Corrections Corp. of America, 390 \n5  F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir. 2004); Rand v. Rowland, 113 F.3d 1520, 1525 (9th Cir. 1997); \n6  Terrell v. Brewer, 935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1991); Wilborn v. Escalderon, 789 F.2d \n7  1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1986).  This denial is without prejudice to the Courtโs sua sponte \n8  appointment of counsel at a future date should the circumstances of this case warrant such \n9  appointment.  \n10  B.   Motion for Extension of Time to Complete Discovery   \n11  On March 13, 2020, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffโs third amended \n12  complaint.  Dkt. No. 32.  On March 19, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion for extension of time \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to complete discovery โso that plaintiff can get evidence to defeat Defendantโs Motion to \nCfi\n tclaC 14  Dismiss.โ  Dkt. No. 33 at 2.  The Court construes the motion as one for an extension of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  time to file opposition to Defendantsโ motion to dismiss.  Defendant filed a conditional \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  non-opposition to Plaintiffโs request for an extension of time, stating that he does not \nS de nre 17  oppose a finite extension of time of reasonable duration for Plaintiff to respond.  Dkt. No. \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  34.  More recently on April 20, 2020, Defendant filed a โnotice of assisted filing and non-\n19  opposition to Plaintiffโs request for extension of time to oppose the motion to dismiss.โ  \n20  Dkt. No. 37.  Attached are some papers which Plaintiff mailed to Defendantโs counsel, \n21  asking him to forward to the Court.  Id.    \n22  In light of Defendantโs non-opposition and good cause appearing, Plaintiffโs motion \n23  is GRANTED.  Dkt. No. 33.  Plaintiff shall file an opposition in the time set forth below.      \n24     \n25  CONCLUSION \n26    For the reasons discussed above, the Court orders as follows:  \n27  1.  Plaintiffโs motions regarding appointment of counsel are DENIED.  Dkt. \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 39   Filed 04/23/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n \n1  Nos. 24, 30. \n2  2.  Plaintiffโs motion to amend is DENIED as unnecessary.  Dkt. No. 26.  The \n3  third amended complaint, Dkt. No. 29, is now the operative complaint in this action.   \n4  3.  Defendantโs motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is DENIED as \n5  moot.  Dkt. No. 27.   \n6  4.  Plaintiffโs motion for an extension of time to file opposition to Defendantโs \n7  latest motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  Dkt. No. 33.  Plaintiffโs opposition shall be filed \n8  no later than twenty-eight (28) days from the date this order is filed.  Defendant shall \n9  file a reply brief no later than fourteen (14) days after Plaintiffโs opposition is filed.   \n10    This order terminates Docket Nos. 24, 26, 27, 30, and 33. \n11  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n12  Dated:  __April 23, 2020_______    ________________________ \n \na\ntr in BETH LABSON FREEMAN \nuoro 13 \nCfi United States District Judge \n tclaC 14   \ni\nrts fo  \niD s tcir 15    \net  \ntatsiD 16   \nS d nr   \neteh 17   \nintr  \nUoN 18   \n \n \n19   \n \n \n20 \n \n \n21   \n \n \n22   \n \n \n23 \n \n \n24   \n \nOrder Addressing Pending Motions \n25 \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_mots \n26 \n27 \n28  4 ",

No. 32) \nth\nintr\nUo Plaintiff, a California state prisoner currently at Corcoran State Prison, filed a pro se \nN 18 \ncivil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, against employees at San Quentin State \n19 \nPrison (โSQSPโ).  The Court twice dismissed the complaint with leave to amend for \n20 \nPlaintiff to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n21 \nDkt. Nos. 7, 15.  The Court found the second amended complaint, Dkt. No. 19, stated a \n22 \ncognizable Eighth Amendment claim for failure to protect against Defendant Clawson and \n23 \ndismissed all other claims against this defendant and unrelated claims against others.  Dkt. \n24 \nNo. 22 at 2-3.  Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint as a matter of course within \n25 \ntwenty-one days of it being served, as permitted under Rule 15(a)(1)(A).  Dkt. No. 29.  \n26 \nAccordingly, the third amended complaint is the operative complaint in this action.  The \n27 \n28   \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 2 of 13\n \n \n1  Court will first conduct an initial screening of this third amended complaint below.   \n2  Furthermore, Defendant Clawson has filed a motion to dismiss the third amended \n3  complaint without prejudice for Plaintiffโs failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior \n4  to filing suit.  Dkt. No. 32.1  Plaintiff filed an opposition with supporting documents in \n5  response to Defendantโs motion, Dkt. No. 42, and Defendant filed a reply, Dkt. No. 44.   \n6  For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffโs third amended complaint is DISMISSED \n7  IN PART without leave to amend, and Defendantโs motion to dismiss is GRANTED with \n8  respect to the remaining claims against Defendant Clawson. \n9   \n10  DISCUSSION \n11  I.    Initial Screening \n12  A.   Standard of Review \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  A federal court must conduct a preliminary screening in any case in which a \nCfi\n tclaC 14  prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  governmental entity.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(a).  In its review, the court must identify any \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  cognizable claims and dismiss any claims that are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim \nS de nre 17  upon which relief may be granted or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  from such relief.  See id. ยง 1915A(b)(1),(2).  Pro se pleadings must, however, be liberally \n19 \n \n20 \n1 Under the law of the circuit, a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 must be \naccompanied by a Rand notice so that the prisoner plaintiff will have fair, timely and \n21 \nadequate notice of what is required of him in order to oppose the motion. Woods v. Carey, \n684 F.3d 934, 935 (9th Cir. 2012) (notice requirement set out in Rand v. Rowland, 154 \n22 \nF.3d 952 (9th Cir. 1998), must be served concurrently with motion for summary \njudgment).  A similar notice must also accompany an unenumerated Rule 12(b)(6) motion \n23 \nfor failure to exhaust available administrative remedies but only where a district court will \nconsider materials beyond the pleadings.  See Stratton v. Buck, 697 F.3d 1004, 1008-09 \n24 \n(9th Cir. 2012) (unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust \navailable administrative remedies must be accompanied by notice similar to Rand notice \n25 \nwhere the district court will consider materials beyond the pleadings).  Here, Defendant \noffers no material beyond the pleadings in support of his motion to dismiss, relying only \n26 \non the information provided in Plaintiffโs papers.  Accordingly, the Court finds no such \n27  notice was required to accompany Defendantโs motion to dismiss. \n \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 3 of 13\n \n \n1  construed.  See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).   \n2    To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a plaintiff must allege two essential \n3  elements: (1) that a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States was \n4  violated, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under the \n5  color of state law.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n6  B.   Plaintiffโs Claims \n7  The underlying events took place at SQSP, where Plaintiff was formerly \n8  incarcerated.  Plaintiff claims that on or about August 14, 2018, he was beaten and battered \n9  by four inmates while he was waiting for his cell door to be unlocked after returning from \n10  evening meal.  Dkt. No. 29 at 4.  Plaintiff claims that Defendant Clawson discharged his \n11  weapon and shot Plaintiff in his lower back towards his buttocks, rather than the four \n12  intended targets, โwithout verbal warning.โ  Id.  As a result, the assailants failed to comply \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and continued to assault Plaintiff.  Id.  Plaintiff claims that Defendant Clawson had pepper \nCfi\n tclaC 14  spray in his possession, which was โless likely to relate to death or serious bodily injuryโ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  but that he โdeliberately failed the use of alternatives to the immediate use of deadly forceโ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and acted with deliberate indifference when he shot Plaintiff with his block gun โto cause \nS de nre 17  [him] intentional injury, [and] damage.โ  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff claims Defendant Clawsonโs \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  actions were โunwarrantedโ because Plaintiff was the victim whom Defendant failed to \n19  protect from harm.  Id.  Plaintiff sues Defendant Clawson in his individual and official \n20  capacities and seeks damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. at 4, 7.  \n21  Liberally construed, Plaintiff states a cognizable claim against Defendant Clawson under \n22  the Eighth Amendment for failure to protect.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 \n23  (1994); Hearns v. Terhune, 413 F.3d 1036, 1041-42 (9th Cir. 2005).     \n24  For the first time, Plaintiff names Warden Ron Davis as a defendant in this action, \n25  claiming generally that Defendant Davis โfailed in his duty to act upon notice, reports, \n26  appeals, and knowledge, promulgated a policy that does direct or condone the wrongful \n27 \n \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 4 of 13\n \n \n1  conduct of defendant[] Clawson.โ  Dkt. No. 29 at 4.  Plaintiff also claims for the first time \n2  that the Director of the CDCR โis held liable for Warden Ron Davisโs actions, who are \n3  prison policymakers, writes regulations, or gives orders, at least for the purpose of prison \n4  management.โ  Id. at 4-5.  Based on these general allegations, Plaintiff is clearly \n5  attempting to hold the Warden and Director liable solely based on the acts of their \n6  subordinates and employees, which is not sufficient to state a claim.  However, his \n7  allegations are insufficient to support such a claim.    \n8  First of all, under no circumstances is there liability under ยง 1983 solely because \n9  one is responsible for the actions or omissions of another.  See Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d \n10  1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989).  A supervisor may be liable under section 1983 upon a \n11  showing of (1) personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation or (2) a sufficient \n12  causal connection between the supervisorโs wrongful conduct and the constitutional \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  violation.  Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2012).  Even if a \nCfi\n tclaC 14  supervisory official is not directly involved in the allegedly unconstitutional conduct, โ[a] \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  supervisor can be liable in this individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates; for his acquiescence in the \nS de nre 17  constitutional deprivation; or for conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  the rights of others.โ  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1208 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  \n19  Plaintiff provides no specific allegations establishing that Warden Davis and the Director \n20  were personally involved in Defendant Clawsonโs failure to protect, nor has Plaintiff set \n21  forth any factual allegations establishing that these supervisor defendants engaged in \n22  specific wrongful conduct that is causally connected with the claim against Defendant \n23  Clawson.  See Henry A., 378 F.3d at 1003-04.  Nor has Plaintiff set forth any allegations \n24  establishing liability under the factors set forth in Starr, 652 F.3d at 1208.  If this \n25  inadequacy in pleading had occurred in Plaintiffโs original complaint, leave to amend \n26  might be considered.  However, leave need not be granted where the amendment of the \n27 \n \n28  4 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 5 of 13\n \n \n1  complaint would cause the opposing party undue prejudice, is sought in bad faith, \n2  constitutes an exercise in futility, or creates undue delay.  See Janicki Logging Co., 42 F.3d \n3  at 566; Roberts v. Arizona Bd. of Regents, 661 F.2d 796, 798 (9th Cir. 1981).  A district \n4  courtโs discretion to deny leave to amend is particularly broad where the plaintiff has \n5  previously filed an amended complaint.  Wagh v. Metris Direct, Inc., 363 F.3d 821, 830 \n6  (9th Cir. 2003); Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1992).  Plaintiff has had \n7  three opportunities to file an amended complaint, and before the Court is Defendantโs \n8  motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  Therefore, leave to \n9  amend to correct the deficiency in the claims against these supervisory defendants will not \n10  be granted as it would be futile, would create undue delay, and Plaintiff has already been \n11  granted several opportunities to file an amended complaint.  Accordingly, the claims \n12  against Defendants Davis and the Director are DISMISSED without leave to amend.        \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiff asserts other claims against unnamed individuals for events that occurred \nCfi\n tclaC 14  subsequent to the assault, asserting generally that the claims involve a different set of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  defendants โall related to each other, arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  series of transactions or occurrencesโ under Rule 20(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nS de nre 17  Procedure.  Dkt. No. 29 at 5-6.  However, the Court is not persuaded that these additional \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  claims, which involve allegations of inadequate medical treatment, the transfer to \n19  disciplinary housing without due process, and the denial of First Amendment rights, are \n20  related to the failure to protect claim against Defendant Clawson.  Plaintiff has already \n21  been twice granted leave to amend and has amended once as a matter of course.  \n22  Accordingly, the Court will exercise its broad discretion to deny leave to amend in this \n23  regard as Plaintiff has already been granted several opportunities to file an amended \n24  complaint.  See Wagh, 363 F.3d at 830.  Therefore, these additional claims are \n25  DISMISSED without leave to amend as improperly joined to this action in violation of \n26  Rules 18(a) and 20(a).     \n27 \n \n28  5 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 6 of 13\n \n \n1  Based on the foregoing, the only remaining claims and defendant in this action is \n2  the Eighth Amendment claim against Defendant Clawson, for failure to protect Plaintiff \n3  during the August 14, 2018 assault by inmates.  See supra at 3.  The Court will move on to \n4  consider Defendantโs motion to dismiss the claims against him based on Plaintiffโs failure \n5  to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit.  Dkt. No. 32.   \n6  II.    Motion to Dismiss \n7  A.  Standard of Review \n8    A complaint must contain โa short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n9  pleader is entitled to relief,โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) and a complaint that fails to do so is \n10  subject to dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \n11  dismiss, the plaintiff must allege โenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on \n12  its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  This โfacial plausibilityโ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  standard requires the plaintiff to allege facts that add up to โmore than a sheer possibility \nCfi\n tclaC 14  that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  โWhile legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  supported by factual allegations.โ  Id.  \nS de nre 17    In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court must accept as true all facts \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Plaintiff.  See \n19  al-Kidd v. Ashcroft, 580 F.3d 949, 956 (9th Cir. 2009).  If the Court dismisses a complaint, \n20  it must decide whether to grant leave to amend.  The Ninth Circuit has โrepeatedly held \n21  that a district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading \n22  was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the \n23  allegation of other facts.โ  Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations \n24  and internal quotation marks omitted). \n25  B.   Exhaustion \n26  The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (โPLRAโ) amended 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e to \n27 \n \n28  6 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 7 of 13\n \n \n1  provide that โ[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 \n2  U.S.C. ยง 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or \n3  other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are \n4  exhausted.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).  Exhaustion is mandatory and no longer left to the \n5  discretion of the district court.   Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) (citing Booth v. \n6  Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 739 (2001)).  โPrisoners must now exhaust all โavailableโ \n7  remedies, not just those that meet federal standards.โ  Id.  Even when the relief sought \n8  cannot be granted by the administrative process, i.e., monetary damages, a prisoner must \n9  still exhaust administrative remedies.  Id. at 85-86 (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 734).  The \n10  PLRAโs exhaustion requirement requires โproper exhaustionโ of available administrative \n11  remedies.  Id. at 93.  An action must be dismissed unless the prisoner exhausted his \n12  available administrative remedies before he or she filed suit, even if the prisoner fully \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  exhausts while the suit is pending.  McKinney v. Carey, 311 F.3d 1198, 1199 (9th Cir. \nCfi\n tclaC 14  2002); see Vaden v. Summerhill, 449 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir. 2006) (where \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administrative remedies are not exhausted before the prisoner sends his complaint to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  court it will be dismissed even if exhaustion is completed by the time the complaint is \nS de nre 17  actually filed).   \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (โCDCRโ) provides \n19  its inmates and parolees the right to appeal administratively โany departmental decision, \n20  action, condition, or policy which they can demonstrate as having an adverse effect upon \n21  their welfare.โ  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 15, ยง 3084.1(a).  It also provides its inmates the right \n22  to file administrative appeals alleging misconduct by correctional officers.  See id. ยง \n23  3084.1(e).  Under the current regulations, in order to exhaust available administrative \n24  remedies within this system, a prisoner must submit his complaint on CDCR Form 602 \n25  (referred to as a โ602โ) and proceed through three levels of appeal: (1) first formal level \n26  appeal filed with one of the institutionโs appeal coordinators, (2) second formal level \n27 \n \n28  7 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 8 of 13\n \n \n1  appeal filed with the institution head or designee, and (3) third formal level appeal filed \n2  with the CDCR director or designee.  Id. ยง 3084.7.    \n3    Failure to exhaust under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a) \n4  (PLRA), is โan affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.โ  Jones v. Bock, \n5  549 U.S. 199, 204, 216 (2007).  Defendants have the burden of raising and proving the \n6  absence of exhaustion, and inmates are not required to specifically plead or demonstrate \n7  exhaustion in their complaints.  Id. at 215-17.  In the rare event that a failure to exhaust is \n8  clear on the face of the complaint, a defendant may move for dismissal under Rule \n9  12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1166 \n10  (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc).2 \n11    The defendantโs burden is to prove that there was an available administrative \n12  remedy and that the prisoner did not exhaust that available administrative remedy.  Id. at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  1172; see id. at 1176 (reversing district courtโs grant of summary judgment to defendants \nCfi\n tclaC 14  on issue of exhaustion because defendants did not carry their initial burden of proving their \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  affirmative defense that there was an available administrative remedy that prisoner \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  plaintiff failed to exhaust); see also Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 936-37 (9th Cir. 2005) \nS de nre 17  (as there can be no absence of exhaustion unless some relief remains available, movant \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  claiming lack of exhaustion must demonstrate that pertinent relief remained available, \n19  whether at unexhausted levels or through awaiting results of relief already granted as result \n20  of that process).  Once the defendant has carried that burden, the prisoner has the burden of \n21  production.  Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172.  That is, the burden shifts to the prisoner to come \n22  forward with evidence showing that there is something in his particular case that made the \n23 \n \n24 \n2 In Albino, the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, overruled Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, \n1119 (9th Cir. 2003), which held that failure to exhaust available administrative remedies \n25 \nunder the PLRA, should be raised by a defendant as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion.  \nAlbino, 747 F.3d at 1166.  โ[A] failure to exhaust is more appropriately handled under the \n26 \nframework of the existing rules than under an โunenumeratedโ (that is, non-existent) rule.โ  \n27  Id. \n \n28  8 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 9 of 13\n \n \n1  existing and generally available administrative remedies effectively unavailable to him.  \n2  Id.  But as required by Jones, the ultimate burden of proof remains with the defendant.  Id.  \n3  C.  Analysis \n4    Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a complaint on September 11, 2018.  Dkt. No. \n5  1.  The Court dismissed the original complaint after finding it improperly joined unrelated \n6  claims against unrelated defendants in violation of Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal \n7  Rules of Civil Procedure.  Dkt. No. 7.  Among the claims, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant \n8  Clawson failed to protect him during an assault by several inmates, during which \n9  Defendant shot Plaintiff with his block gun.  Dkt. No. 1 at 7.  Plaintiff repeated this claim \n10  against Defendant Clawson in his first amended complaint, Dkt. No. 10 at 6, and again in \n11  his second amended complaint, Dkt. No. 19 at 4.  He raised it again in the third amended \n12  complaint on March 6, 2020.  Dkt. No. 29 at 4.      \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    Defendant asserts that Plaintiffโs pleadings show that he initiated Californiaโs \nCfi\n tclaC 14  administrative exhaustion process after commencing this lawsuit.  Dkt. No. 32 at 4.  In \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  doing so, Defendant asserts Plaintiff failed to satisfy exhaustion requirements as mandated \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by the Ninth Circuit.  Id.  Defendant acknowledges that there is a limited exception for \nS de nre 17  claims by a prisoner exhausted before the filing of an amended complaint under Rhodes v. \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  Robinson, 621 F.3d 1002, 1005 (9th Cir. 2010).  Id.  However, Defendant asserts that the \n19  exception only applies to newly added claims, and Plaintiffโs claims against Defendant \n20  Clawson are not newly added since he raised them in his original complaint, prior to when \n21  Plaintiff exhausted them.  Id.   \n22  In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that he submitted multiple appeals and complaints \n23  which โprison appeal coordinator has repeatedly rejected/canceled violating plaintiffโs due \n24  process and right to redress off grievance, thereby finalizing exhaustion.โ  Dkt. No. 42 at 2.  \n25  He asserts that despite prison officials repeatedly obstructing his inmate complaint process, \n26  he continued in good faith to exhaust his remedies.  Id.  Plaintiff submits copies of the \n27 \n \n28  9 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 10 of 13\n \n \n1  grievances that show that he exhausted his remedies at the second level prior to initial \n2  filing of the civil complaint.  Id., Ex. A.   \n3  In reply, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffโs supporting documents filed with his \n4  opposition further substantiate Defendantโs position.  Dkt. No. 44 at 1.  Defendant points \n5  out that the prison officials found the second-level response to Plaintiffโs administrative \n6  appeal constituted exhaustion of the prisonโs administrative remedies.  Id., citing Dkt. No. \n7  42 at 10.  Defendant asserts that the second level response was issued on November 6, \n8  2018, but Plaintiff filed this action on September 11, 2018.  Dkt. No. 44 at 1, citing Dkt. \n9  No. 42 at 11-13; Dkt. No. 1.  Therefore, Defendant asserts that this action must be \n10  dismissed.  Dkt. No. 44 at 2.     \n11  After carefully considering all the pleadings and construing the facts in the light \n12  most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds Plaintiff clearly failed to exhaust administrative \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  remedies prior to filing this lawsuit.  There is no dispute that Plaintiff initiated this action \nCfi\n tclaC 14  on September 11, 2018, and that the original complaint contained the failure to protect \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  claim against Defendant Clawson.  Dkt. No. 1.  Accordingly, the claim is not a newly \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  added claim that was exhausted before Plaintiff filed the third amended complaint on \nS de nre 17  March 6, 2020, such that the exception under Rhodes, 621 F.3d at 1005, would apply.  It is \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  also not disputed that Plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies on November 6, 2018, \n19  when the second level of appeal issued its decision.  Dkt. No. 42 at 10.  Plaintiff alleges in \n20  the third amended complaint that the first level of appeal was concluded on October 15, \n21  2018, and the second level was concluded on November 6, 2018.  Dkt. No. 29 at 7.  \n22  Plaintiffโs opposition attaches the appeal documents, further confirming the dates of his \n23  appeals.  Dkt. No. 42 at 10.  Both the third amended complaint and Plaintiffโs own \n24  documents demonstrate that exhaustion was completed nearly two months after Plaintiff \n25  filed this action on September 11, 2018.  Dkt. No. 1.  An action must be dismissed unless \n26  the prisoner exhausted his available administrative remedies before he filed suit, even if \n27 \n \n28  10 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 11 of 13\n \n \n1  the prisoner fully exhausts while the suit is pending.  See McKinney, 311 F.3d at 1199.  \n2  Accordingly, Defendant has shown that there was an available administrative remedy and \n3  Plaintiff did not exhaust that available administrative remedy before he filed this action.  \n4  See Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172; see id. at 1176.   \n5  In response, Plaintiff must show that that there was something in his particular case \n6  that made existing and generally available administrative remedies unavailable to him.  See \n7  Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172.  In opposition, he claims that prison officials obstructed his \n8  inmate complaint process.  See supra at 10.  However, the papers submitted by Plaintiff \n9  show that he was able to submit an inmate grievance eleven days after the incident on \n10  August 25, 2018, alleging that the โcorrectional officer fired his gun and shot [Plaintiff] on \n11  the lower right side of [his] body towards [his] buttocksโ and seeking disciplinary action \n12  against this officer.  Dkt. No. 42 at 7-8.  This grievance was assigned Log No. SQ-A-18-\n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  02997.  Id.  Three days later on August 28, 2018, the grievance was returned to Plaintiff \nCfi\n tclaC 14  because he had exceeded the allowable number of appeals filed in a 14 calendar day \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  period; he was advised to wait until September 12, 2018, to file another appeal.  Dkt. No. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  42 at 18.  Plaintiff resubmitted the appeal, which was again screened out at the first level \nS de nre 17  on September 26, 2018, because the issue was obscured.  Dkt. No. 42 at 17.  Plaintiff was \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  able to submit the appeal a third time, at which point it was accepted and assigned to a first \n19  level responder on October 10, 2018.  Id. at 7.  This series of events does not indicate that \n20  prison officials were obstructing Plaintiffโs inmate process, but rather that Plaintiff was \n21  failing to comply with grievance procedures.  He was given several opportunities to \n22  remedy the deficiencies and was able to proceed with the appeal once he had complied.  \n23  Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to show that there was something in his \n24  particular case that made existing and generally available administrative remedies \n25  unavailable to him.  See Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172.  Rather, Plaintiff was merely impatient \n26  with the process and prematurely filed this action on September 11, 2018, immediately \n27 \n \n28  11 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 12 of 13\n \n \n1  after the appeal was first returned to him on August 28, 2018.  In fact, the original \n2  complaint was signed on August 29, 2018, the day after the inmate grievance was returned \n3  to him the first time.  Dkt. No. 1 at 3.  There is no evidence that prison officials were \n4  preventing Plaintiff from exhausting administrative remedies, and the papers submitted by \n5  Plaintiff show that he was in fact able to exhaust administrative remedies while this action \n6  was pending.  Had he simply been patient a few months and followed the matter through \n7  the various levels of review, Plaintiff would not be facing dismissal now.     \n8  Based on the foregoing, Defendantโs motion to dismiss the claims against him for \n9  failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit is GRANTED.  See \n10  McKinney, 311 F.3d at 1199; see Vaden, 449 F.3d at 1051 (where administrative remedies \n11  are not exhausted before the prisoner sends his complaint to the court it will be dismissed \n12  even if exhaustion is completed by the time the complaint is actually filed).   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tclaC 14  CONCLUSION \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  For the forgoing reasons, the Court orders as follows:  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  1.  Based upon an initial screening, the new claims in the third amended \nS de nre 17  complaint against Defendants Warden Ron Davis and the Director of the CDCR based on \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  supervisor liability, as well as the unrelated claims against unnamed defendants, are \n19  DISMISSED without leave to amend.  See supra at 3-6.  The Clerk shall terminate these \n20  Defendants from this action.   \n21  2.  Defendant Clawsonโs motion to dismiss the Eighth Amendment claim \n22  against him is GRANTED for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  Dkt. No. 32.  \n23  All claims against him, in his individual and official capacities, are DISMISSED without \n24  prejudice.   \n25  The Clerk shall close the file.   \n26  This order terminates Docket No. 32. \n27 \n \n28  12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 13 of 13\n \n \n1     IT IS SO ORDERED. \n2  Dated:  _December 2, 2020____      ________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n3 \nUnited States District Judge \n \n4 \n \n \n5   \n \n \n6   \n \n7   \n \n \n8   \n \n \n9 \n \n \n10   \n \n \n11   \n \n \n12 \na   \ntr in  \nuoro 13   \nCfi  \n tla  \ncC 14 \ni  \nrts fo  \niD tc 15   \n sir  \netattsiD 16    \nS d nr   \nee 17 \nth  \nintr  \nUo\nN 18   \n \n \n19 \n \n \n20   \n \n \n21   \n \n \n22 \n \n \n23   \n \n \n24 \n \n \n25  Order Granting Def;s MTD  \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_grant-MTD(exh) \n26 \n27 \n \n28  13 ",

The Court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend for Plaintiff to file \n20  an amended complaint that complies with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of \n21  Civil Procedure.  (Docket No. 7.)  Plaintiff has filed an amended complaint.  (Docket No. \n22  10.)   \n23   \n24  DISCUSSION \n25  A.  Standard of Review \n26    A federal court must conduct a preliminary screening in any case in which a \n27  prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a \n28  governmental entity.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(a).  In its review, the court must identify any \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 2 of 5\n \n \n1  cognizable claims and dismiss any claims that are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim \n2  upon which relief may be granted or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune \n3  from such relief.  See id. ยง 1915A(b)(1),(2).  Pro se pleadings must, however, be liberally \n4  construed.  See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).   \n5    To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a plaintiff must allege two essential \n6  elements: (1) that a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States was \n7  violated, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under the \n8  color of state law.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n9  B.  Plaintiffโs Claims  \n10  Plaintiffโs original complaint was problematic because it contained unrelated claims \n11  against different individuals at SQSP based on separate incidents that occurred during July, \n12  August, September 2018.  (Docket No. 7 at 2.)  In granting leave to amend, the Court \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  advised Plaintiff that an amended complaint must contain โonly related claims against the \nCif\nct Cal 14  appropriate Defendantsโ to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of \nstriof \nDict  15  Civil Procedure.  (Id. at 3.)  However, the amended complaint does not remedy this defect.   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Plaintiff claims that on July 30, 2018, when he arrived at SQSP, he was placed into \nS \ned ern 17  a single man cage for over ten hours in unsanitary conditions and without toilet access, in \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Am. Compl. at 4.)  Plaintiff \n19  also claims that Defendant Malikian destroyed his legal and personal correspondence โto \n20  obstruct his access to the courts,โ and that Defendant Malikian also threatened to beat and \n21  batter Plaintiff because he โdoes not like his kind of people,โ in violation of First, Sixth, \n22  Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Id.)  Plaintiff also claims that on August 14, \n23  2018, he was shot at by Officer Clawson during an altercation with other inmates, and that \n24  this use of deadly force was โout of retaliation for complaining.โ  (Id. at 6.)  Plaintiff also \n25  claims that after he was transferred to protective custody, he was repeatedly denied access \n26  to the law library, religious services, mental health services, cleaning supplies, soap, clean \n27  clothing and linen exchanges, among other deprivations, in violation of his First, Sixth, \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 3 of 5\n \n \n1  Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Id. at 8.)   \n2  โA party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, \n3  as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party.โ  \n4  Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a).  Accordingly, โmultiple claims against a single party are fine, but \n5  Claim A against Defendant 1 should not be joined with unrelated Claim B against \n6  Defendant 2.โ  George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007).  โUnrelated claims \n7  against different defendants belong in different suits,โ not only to prevent the sort of \n8  โmorassโ that a multi-claim, multi-defendant suit can produce, โbut also to ensure that \n9  prisoners pay the required filing fees โ for the Prison Litigation Reform Act limits to 3 the \n10  number of frivolous suits or appeals that any prisoner may file without prepayment of \n11  required fees.โ  Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(g)).   \n12  The amended complaint contains multiple claims against different defendants at \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  SQSP.  These claims and defendants are not all related to each other and do not all arise \nCif\nct Cal 14  out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.  Fed. R. \nstriof \nDict  15  Civ. P. 20(a)(2).  โA buckshot complaint that would be rejected if filed by a free person โ \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  say, a suit complaining that A defrauded plaintiff, B defamed him, C punched him, D \nS \ned ern 17  failed to pay a debt, and E infringed his copyright, all in different transactions โ should be \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  rejected if filed by a prisoner.โ  George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) (noting \n19  that, in prisoner complaint seeking to join 24 defendants and approximately 50 distinct \n20  claims, prisoner made no effort to show that 24 defendants he named had participated in \n21  the same transaction or series of transactions or that a question of fact is common to all \n22  defendants).  Plaintiffโs amended complaint is such a โbuckshot complaint,โ and should be \n23  rejected.  Id.    \n24  Accordingly, the Court finds that the multiple claims against multiple defendants at \n25  SQSP are improperly joined in this single action.  In the interest of justice, Plaintiff shall \n26  be granted one final opportunity to file a second amended complaint containing only \n27  related claims against properly joined Defendants.  This being Plaintiffโs second \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 4 of 5\n \n \n1  opportunity to correct this deficiency, no further opportunities shall be given if he again \n2  fails to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) in the second amended complaint.   \n3  C.    Pending Motion \n4  Plaintiff was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis (โIFPโ) under 28 U.S.C. ยง \n5  1915, with an initial filing fee of $43.15 being immediately due and fees thereafter to be \n6  paid as were available in Plaintiffโs prisoner account.  (Docket No. 6.)  The initial filing \n7  fee was calculated at 20 percent of $215.75, which was the amount indicated on the \n8  Certificate of Funds in Prisonerโs Account as both the average deposit each month to \n9  Plaintiffโs prisonerโs account for the most recent six-month period and the average balance \n10  in the prisonerโs account each month for the same six-month period.  (Docket No. 2-1 at \n11  1.)  Plaintiff has filed an application for the total filing fee of $350 to be waived or \n12  modified.  (Docket No. 13.)  \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  Section 1915 permits indigent prisoner plaintiffs to proceed in a civil action without \nCif\nct Cal 14  the prepayment of filing fees, but still requires that the entire filing fee be paid.  In granting \nstriof \nDict  15  Plaintiffโs IFP motion, the Court found that Plaintiff showed an ability to pay an initial \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  partial filing fee pursuant to ยง 19159(B)(1).  (Docket No. 6 at 1.)  The prison trust account \nS \ned ern 17  office was instructed to take funds for the remainder of the filing fee from Plaintiffโs \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  account in accordance with ยง 19159(B)(1), and instructions were provided.  (Id. at 1-2.)  \n19  The Court finds no further modification of this order regarding payment of fees is \n20  warranted.  Accordingly, Plaintiffโs application is DENIED.   \n21   \n22  CONCLUSION \n23  For the foregoing reasons, the Court orders as follows:  \n24  1.   Plaintiffโs application for modification or reduction of the filing fee is \n25  DENIED.  (Docket No. 13.)  \n26  2.   The amended complaint is DISMISSED with leave to amend.  Within \n27  twenty-eight (28) days of the date this order is filed, Plaintiff shall file a second amended \n28  4 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 5 of 5\n \n \n1  complaint that complies with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n2  Procedure.  The second amended complaint must include the caption and civil case number \n3  used in this order, Case No. C 18-05558 BLF (PR), and the words โSECOND AMENDED \n4  COMPLAINTโ on the first page.  If using the court form complaint, Plaintiff must answer \n5  all the questions on the form in order for the action to proceed.   \n6    The second amended complaint supersedes all previous complaints, which are \n7  treated thereafter as non-existent.  Ramirez v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 806 F.3d 1002, 1008 \n8  (9th Cir. 2015).  Consequently, claims not included in an amended complaint are no longer \n9  claims and defendants not named in an amended complaint are no longer defendants.  See \n10  Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th Cir.1992).   \n11  Failure to respond in accordance with this order in the time provided will \n12  result in the dismissal of this action without prejudice and without further notice to \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  Plaintiff.  Furthermore, if the second amended complaint fails to comply with Rules \nCif\nct Cal 14  18(a) and 20(a), this action shall be dismissed for improper joinder of claims and \nstriof \nDict  15  defendants.   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  The Clerk shall include two copies of the courtโs complaint with a copy of this \nS \ned ern 17  order to Plaintiff.   \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  This order terminates Docket No. 13. \n19  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n20  Dated:  _____________________    ________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n21 \nUnited States District Judge \n \n22 \n \n \n23 \n \n \n24   \n \n \n25  Order of DWLTA; Denying Mot. \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_dwlta1.motion \n26 \n27 \n28  5 ",

The Court found the second amended complaint, Dkt. No. 19 (hereinafter \n20 \nโSACโ), stated a cognizable claim for failure to protect under the Eighth Amendment and \n21 \nordered the matter served on Defendant Correctional Officer Clawson at the San Quentin \n22 \nState Prison.1  Dkt.

Defendant Clawson filed notice conceding that since Plaintiff is \n25 \npermitted to amend his complaint as a matter of course within twenty-one days of their \n26 \n \n27 \n1 The Court dismissed all other claims and defendants from this action for failure to state a \nclaim, as well as failure to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n28 \nProcedure.

Dkt. No. 31.  Accordingly, Plaintiffโs motion to \n4  amend is DENIED as unnecessary, Dkt. No. 26, and the third amended complaint is the \n5  operative complaint in this matter under Rule 15(a)(1)(B).  Dkt. No. 29.  Defendantโs \n6  motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is DENIED as moot.  Dkt. No. 27.  The \n7  Court addresses other pending motions below.   \n8   \n9  DISCUSSION \n10  A.   Motions Re Appointment of Counsel \n11  The Court denied each of Plaintiffโs three motions for appointment of counsel for \n12  lack of exceptional circumstances, with the last order filed on August 26, 2019.  Dkt. Nos. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  7, 12, 21.  On January 15, 2020, Plaintiff filed another motion to appoint counsel, Dkt. No. \nCfi\n tclaC 14  24, and a motion for reconsideration of the last court order denying appointment of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  counsel, Dkt. No. 30.  Although titled differently, these two motions essentially assert the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  same arguments.  Plaintiff additionally requests a preliminary injunction and a court order \nS de nre 17  for prison officials to โcease and desist violence, harassment and retaliation to interefer[e] \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  with plaintiffโs civil action.โ  Dkt. No. 24 at 2; Dkt. No. 30 at 2.  Plaintiff is currently \n19  being housed at Corcoran State Prison (โCSPโ), which is not a party to this action.  \n20  Accordingly, the Court has no jurisdiction over CSP or any of its employees in this action \n21  to issue an injunctive order against them.  Plaintiff must file any new claims against CSP \n22  employees in a separate civil rights action.   \n23  Plaintiff asserts the following grounds for appointment of counsel: lack of legal \n24  material and access to the law library and legal assistance, and the need for assistance to \n25  conduct discovery.  Dkt. No. 24 at 4-7; Dkt. No. 30 at 4-7.  The Court notes that despite \n26  the challenges he alleges, Plaintiff managed to file another motion to amend the complaint \n27  and the proposed third amended complaint.  Dkt. Nos. 26, 29.  With respect to discovery, \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 39   Filed 04/23/20   Page 3 of 4\n \n \n1  Plaintiff recently filed a motion requesting more time to conduct discovery to oppose \n2  Defendantโs motion which is generally articulate and organized.  Dkt. No. 33.  \n3  Accordingly, the motions for appointment of counsel and for reconsideration are DENIED \n4  for lack of changed circumstances.  See Agyeman v. Corrections Corp. of America, 390 \n5  F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir. 2004); Rand v. Rowland, 113 F.3d 1520, 1525 (9th Cir. 1997); \n6  Terrell v. Brewer, 935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1991); Wilborn v. Escalderon, 789 F.2d \n7  1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1986).  This denial is without prejudice to the Courtโs sua sponte \n8  appointment of counsel at a future date should the circumstances of this case warrant such \n9  appointment.  \n10  B.   Motion for Extension of Time to Complete Discovery   \n11  On March 13, 2020, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffโs third amended \n12  complaint.  Dkt. No. 32.  On March 19, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion for extension of time \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to complete discovery โso that plaintiff can get evidence to defeat Defendantโs Motion to \nCfi\n tclaC 14  Dismiss.โ  Dkt. No. 33 at 2.  The Court construes the motion as one for an extension of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  time to file opposition to Defendantsโ motion to dismiss.  Defendant filed a conditional \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  non-opposition to Plaintiffโs request for an extension of time, stating that he does not \nS de nre 17  oppose a finite extension of time of reasonable duration for Plaintiff to respond.  Dkt. No. \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  34.  More recently on April 20, 2020, Defendant filed a โnotice of assisted filing and non-\n19  opposition to Plaintiffโs request for extension of time to oppose the motion to dismiss.โ  \n20  Dkt. No. 37.  Attached are some papers which Plaintiff mailed to Defendantโs counsel, \n21  asking him to forward to the Court.  Id.    \n22  In light of Defendantโs non-opposition and good cause appearing, Plaintiffโs motion \n23  is GRANTED.  Dkt. No. 33.  Plaintiff shall file an opposition in the time set forth below.      \n24     \n25  CONCLUSION \n26    For the reasons discussed above, the Court orders as follows:  \n27  1.  Plaintiffโs motions regarding appointment of counsel are DENIED.  Dkt. \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 39   Filed 04/23/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n \n1  Nos. 24, 30. \n2  2.  Plaintiffโs motion to amend is DENIED as unnecessary.  Dkt. No. 26.  The \n3  third amended complaint, Dkt. No. 29, is now the operative complaint in this action.   \n4  3.  Defendantโs motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is DENIED as \n5  moot.  Dkt. No. 27.   \n6  4.  Plaintiffโs motion for an extension of time to file opposition to Defendantโs \n7  latest motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  Dkt. No. 33.  Plaintiffโs opposition shall be filed \n8  no later than twenty-eight (28) days from the date this order is filed.  Defendant shall \n9  file a reply brief no later than fourteen (14) days after Plaintiffโs opposition is filed.   \n10    This order terminates Docket Nos. 24, 26, 27, 30, and 33. \n11  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n12  Dated:  __April 23, 2020_______    ________________________ \n \na\ntr in BETH LABSON FREEMAN \nuoro 13 \nCfi United States District Judge \n tclaC 14   \ni\nrts fo  \niD s tcir 15    \net  \ntatsiD 16   \nS d nr   \neteh 17   \nintr  \nUoN 18   \n \n \n19   \n \n \n20 \n \n \n21   \n \n \n22   \n \n \n23 \n \n \n24   \n \nOrder Addressing Pending Motions \n25 \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_mots \n26 \n27 \n28  4 ",

DEFENDANTโS MOTION TO \nuoro 13    DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO \nCfi EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE \n tclaC 14  RON DAVIS, et al.,  REMEDIES PRIOR TO FILING \ni\nrts fo SUIT \niD tc 15                       Defendants.   \n sir\netatS detsiD nre 1167            (Docket. No. 32) \nth\nintr\nUo Plaintiff, a California state prisoner currently at Corcoran State Prison, filed a pro se \nN 18 \ncivil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, against employees at San Quentin State \n19 \nPrison (โSQSPโ).  The Court twice dismissed the complaint with leave to amend for \n20 \nPlaintiff to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n21 \nDkt. Nos. 7, 15.  The Court found the second amended complaint, Dkt. No. 19, stated a \n22 \ncognizable Eighth Amendment claim for failure to protect against Defendant Clawson and \n23 \ndismissed all other claims against this defendant and unrelated claims against others.  Dkt. \n24 \nNo. 22 at 2-3.  Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint as a matter of course within \n25 \ntwenty-one days of it being served, as permitted under Rule 15(a)(1)(A).  Dkt. No. 29.  \n26 \nAccordingly, the third amended complaint is the operative complaint in this action.  The \n27 \n28   \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 2 of 13\n \n \n1  Court will first conduct an initial screening of this third amended complaint below.   \n2  Furthermore, Defendant Clawson has filed a motion to dismiss the third amended \n3  complaint without prejudice for Plaintiffโs failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior \n4  to filing suit.  Dkt. No. 32.1  Plaintiff filed an opposition with supporting documents in \n5  response to Defendantโs motion, Dkt. No. 42, and Defendant filed a reply, Dkt. No. 44.   \n6  For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffโs third amended complaint is DISMISSED \n7  IN PART without leave to amend, and Defendantโs motion to dismiss is GRANTED with \n8  respect to the remaining claims against Defendant Clawson. \n9   \n10  DISCUSSION \n11  I.    Initial Screening \n12  A.   Standard of Review \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  A federal court must conduct a preliminary screening in any case in which a \nCfi\n tclaC 14  prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  governmental entity.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(a).  In its review, the court must identify any \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  cognizable claims and dismiss any claims that are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim \nS de nre 17  upon which relief may be granted or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  from such relief.  See id. ยง 1915A(b)(1),(2).  Pro se pleadings must, however, be liberally \n19 \n \n20 \n1 Under the law of the circuit, a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 must be \naccompanied by a Rand notice so that the prisoner plaintiff will have fair, timely and \n21 \nadequate notice of what is required of him in order to oppose the motion. Woods v. Carey, \n684 F.3d 934, 935 (9th Cir. 2012) (notice requirement set out in Rand v. Rowland, 154 \n22 \nF.3d 952 (9th Cir. 1998), must be served concurrently with motion for summary \njudgment).  A similar notice must also accompany an unenumerated Rule 12(b)(6) motion \n23 \nfor failure to exhaust available administrative remedies but only where a district court will \nconsider materials beyond the pleadings.  See Stratton v. Buck, 697 F.3d 1004, 1008-09 \n24 \n(9th Cir. 2012) (unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust \navailable administrative remedies must be accompanied by notice similar to Rand notice \n25 \nwhere the district court will consider materials beyond the pleadings).  Here, Defendant \noffers no material beyond the pleadings in support of his motion to dismiss, relying only \n26 \non the information provided in Plaintiffโs papers.  Accordingly, the Court finds no such \n27  notice was required to accompany Defendantโs motion to dismiss. \n \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 3 of 13\n \n \n1  construed.  See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).   \n2    To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a plaintiff must allege two essential \n3  elements: (1) that a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States was \n4  violated, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under the \n5  color of state law.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n6  B.   Plaintiffโs Claims \n7  The underlying events took place at SQSP, where Plaintiff was formerly \n8  incarcerated.  Plaintiff claims that on or about August 14, 2018, he was beaten and battered \n9  by four inmates while he was waiting for his cell door to be unlocked after returning from \n10  evening meal.  Dkt. No. 29 at 4.  Plaintiff claims that Defendant Clawson discharged his \n11  weapon and shot Plaintiff in his lower back towards his buttocks, rather than the four \n12  intended targets, โwithout verbal warning.โ  Id.  As a result, the assailants failed to comply \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and continued to assault Plaintiff.  Id.  Plaintiff claims that Defendant Clawson had pepper \nCfi\n tclaC 14  spray in his possession, which was โless likely to relate to death or serious bodily injuryโ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  but that he โdeliberately failed the use of alternatives to the immediate use of deadly forceโ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and acted with deliberate indifference when he shot Plaintiff with his block gun โto cause \nS de nre 17  [him] intentional injury, [and] damage.โ  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff claims Defendant Clawsonโs \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  actions were โunwarrantedโ because Plaintiff was the victim whom Defendant failed to \n19  protect from harm.  Id.  Plaintiff sues Defendant Clawson in his individual and official \n20  capacities and seeks damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. at 4, 7.  \n21  Liberally construed, Plaintiff states a cognizable claim against Defendant Clawson under \n22  the Eighth Amendment for failure to protect.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 \n23  (1994); Hearns v. Terhune, 413 F.3d 1036, 1041-42 (9th Cir. 2005).     \n24  For the first time, Plaintiff names Warden Ron Davis as a defendant in this action, \n25  claiming generally that Defendant Davis โfailed in his duty to act upon notice, reports, \n26  appeals, and knowledge, promulgated a policy that does direct or condone the wrongful \n27 \n \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 4 of 13\n \n \n1  conduct of defendant[] Clawson.โ  Dkt. No. 29 at 4.  Plaintiff also claims for the first time \n2  that the Director of the CDCR โis held liable for Warden Ron Davisโs actions, who are \n3  prison policymakers, writes regulations, or gives orders, at least for the purpose of prison \n4  management.โ  Id. at 4-5.  Based on these general allegations, Plaintiff is clearly \n5  attempting to hold the Warden and Director liable solely based on the acts of their \n6  subordinates and employees, which is not sufficient to state a claim.  However, his \n7  allegations are insufficient to support such a claim.    \n8  First of all, under no circumstances is there liability under ยง 1983 solely because \n9  one is responsible for the actions or omissions of another.  See Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d \n10  1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989).  A supervisor may be liable under section 1983 upon a \n11  showing of (1) personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation or (2) a sufficient \n12  causal connection between the supervisorโs wrongful conduct and the constitutional \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  violation.  Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2012).  Even if a \nCfi\n tclaC 14  supervisory official is not directly involved in the allegedly unconstitutional conduct, โ[a] \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  supervisor can be liable in this individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates; for his acquiescence in the \nS de nre 17  constitutional deprivation; or for conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  the rights of others.โ  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1208 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  \n19  Plaintiff provides no specific allegations establishing that Warden Davis and the Director \n20  were personally involved in Defendant Clawsonโs failure to protect, nor has Plaintiff set \n21  forth any factual allegations establishing that these supervisor defendants engaged in \n22  specific wrongful conduct that is causally connected with the claim against Defendant \n23  Clawson.  See Henry A., 378 F.3d at 1003-04.  Nor has Plaintiff set forth any allegations \n24  establishing liability under the factors set forth in Starr, 652 F.3d at 1208.  If this \n25  inadequacy in pleading had occurred in Plaintiffโs original complaint, leave to amend \n26  might be considered.  However, leave need not be granted where the amendment of the \n27 \n \n28  4 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 5 of 13\n \n \n1  complaint would cause the opposing party undue prejudice, is sought in bad faith, \n2  constitutes an exercise in futility, or creates undue delay.  See Janicki Logging Co., 42 F.3d \n3  at 566; Roberts v. Arizona Bd. of Regents, 661 F.2d 796, 798 (9th Cir. 1981).  A district \n4  courtโs discretion to deny leave to amend is particularly broad where the plaintiff has \n5  previously filed an amended complaint.  Wagh v. Metris Direct, Inc., 363 F.3d 821, 830 \n6  (9th Cir. 2003); Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1992).  Plaintiff has had \n7  three opportunities to file an amended complaint, and before the Court is Defendantโs \n8  motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  Therefore, leave to \n9  amend to correct the deficiency in the claims against these supervisory defendants will not \n10  be granted as it would be futile, would create undue delay, and Plaintiff has already been \n11  granted several opportunities to file an amended complaint.  Accordingly, the claims \n12  against Defendants Davis and the Director are DISMISSED without leave to amend.        \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiff asserts other claims against unnamed individuals for events that occurred \nCfi\n tclaC 14  subsequent to the assault, asserting generally that the claims involve a different set of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  defendants โall related to each other, arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  series of transactions or occurrencesโ under Rule 20(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nS de nre 17  Procedure.  Dkt. No. 29 at 5-6.  However, the Court is not persuaded that these additional \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  claims, which involve allegations of inadequate medical treatment, the transfer to \n19  disciplinary housing without due process, and the denial of First Amendment rights, are \n20  related to the failure to protect claim against Defendant Clawson.  Plaintiff has already \n21  been twice granted leave to amend and has amended once as a matter of course.  \n22  Accordingly, the Court will exercise its broad discretion to deny leave to amend in this \n23  regard as Plaintiff has already been granted several opportunities to file an amended \n24  complaint.  See Wagh, 363 F.3d at 830.  Therefore, these additional claims are \n25  DISMISSED without leave to amend as improperly joined to this action in violation of \n26  Rules 18(a) and 20(a).     \n27 \n \n28  5 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 6 of 13\n \n \n1  Based on the foregoing, the only remaining claims and defendant in this action is \n2  the Eighth Amendment claim against Defendant Clawson, for failure to protect Plaintiff \n3  during the August 14, 2018 assault by inmates.  See supra at 3.  The Court will move on to \n4  consider Defendantโs motion to dismiss the claims against him based on Plaintiffโs failure \n5  to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit.  Dkt. No. 32.   \n6  II.    Motion to Dismiss \n7  A.  Standard of Review \n8    A complaint must contain โa short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n9  pleader is entitled to relief,โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) and a complaint that fails to do so is \n10  subject to dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \n11  dismiss, the plaintiff must allege โenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on \n12  its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  This โfacial plausibilityโ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  standard requires the plaintiff to allege facts that add up to โmore than a sheer possibility \nCfi\n tclaC 14  that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  โWhile legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  supported by factual allegations.โ  Id.  \nS de nre 17    In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court must accept as true all facts \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Plaintiff.  See \n19  al-Kidd v. Ashcroft, 580 F.3d 949, 956 (9th Cir. 2009).  If the Court dismisses a complaint, \n20  it must decide whether to grant leave to amend.  The Ninth Circuit has โrepeatedly held \n21  that a district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading \n22  was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the \n23  allegation of other facts.โ  Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations \n24  and internal quotation marks omitted). \n25  B.   Exhaustion \n26  The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (โPLRAโ) amended 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e to \n27 \n \n28  6 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 7 of 13\n \n \n1  provide that โ[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 \n2  U.S.C. ยง 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or \n3  other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are \n4  exhausted.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).  Exhaustion is mandatory and no longer left to the \n5  discretion of the district court.   Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) (citing Booth v. \n6  Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 739 (2001)).  โPrisoners must now exhaust all โavailableโ \n7  remedies, not just those that meet federal standards.โ  Id.  Even when the relief sought \n8  cannot be granted by the administrative process, i.e., monetary damages, a prisoner must \n9  still exhaust administrative remedies.  Id. at 85-86 (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 734).  The \n10  PLRAโs exhaustion requirement requires โproper exhaustionโ of available administrative \n11  remedies.  Id. at 93.  An action must be dismissed unless the prisoner exhausted his \n12  available administrative remedies before he or she filed suit, even if the prisoner fully \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  exhausts while the suit is pending.  McKinney v. Carey, 311 F.3d 1198, 1199 (9th Cir. \nCfi\n tclaC 14  2002); see Vaden v. Summerhill, 449 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir. 2006) (where \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administrative remedies are not exhausted before the prisoner sends his complaint to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  court it will be dismissed even if exhaustion is completed by the time the complaint is \nS de nre 17  actually filed).   \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (โCDCRโ) provides \n19  its inmates and parolees the right to appeal administratively โany departmental decision, \n20  action, condition, or policy which they can demonstrate as having an adverse effect upon \n21  their welfare.โ  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 15, ยง 3084.1(a).  It also provides its inmates the right \n22  to file administrative appeals alleging misconduct by correctional officers.  See id. ยง \n23  3084.1(e).  Under the current regulations, in order to exhaust available administrative \n24  remedies within this system, a prisoner must submit his complaint on CDCR Form 602 \n25  (referred to as a โ602โ) and proceed through three levels of appeal: (1) first formal level \n26  appeal filed with one of the institutionโs appeal coordinators, (2) second formal level \n27 \n \n28  7 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 8 of 13\n \n \n1  appeal filed with the institution head or designee, and (3) third formal level appeal filed \n2  with the CDCR director or designee.  Id. ยง 3084.7.    \n3    Failure to exhaust under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a) \n4  (PLRA), is โan affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.โ  Jones v. Bock, \n5  549 U.S. 199, 204, 216 (2007).  Defendants have the burden of raising and proving the \n6  absence of exhaustion, and inmates are not required to specifically plead or demonstrate \n7  exhaustion in their complaints.  Id. at 215-17.  In the rare event that a failure to exhaust is \n8  clear on the face of the complaint, a defendant may move for dismissal under Rule \n9  12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1166 \n10  (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc).2 \n11    The defendantโs burden is to prove that there was an available administrative \n12  remedy and that the prisoner did not exhaust that available administrative remedy.  Id. at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  1172; see id. at 1176 (reversing district courtโs grant of summary judgment to defendants \nCfi\n tclaC 14  on issue of exhaustion because defendants did not carry their initial burden of proving their \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  affirmative defense that there was an available administrative remedy that prisoner \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  plaintiff failed to exhaust); see also Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 936-37 (9th Cir. 2005) \nS de nre 17  (as there can be no absence of exhaustion unless some relief remains available, movant \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  claiming lack of exhaustion must demonstrate that pertinent relief remained available, \n19  whether at unexhausted levels or through awaiting results of relief already granted as result \n20  of that process).  Once the defendant has carried that burden, the prisoner has the burden of \n21  production.  Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172.  That is, the burden shifts to the prisoner to come \n22  forward with evidence showing that there is something in his particular case that made the \n23 \n \n24 \n2 In Albino, the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, overruled Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, \n1119 (9th Cir. 2003), which held that failure to exhaust available administrative remedies \n25 \nunder the PLRA, should be raised by a defendant as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion.  \nAlbino, 747 F.3d at 1166.  โ[A] failure to exhaust is more appropriately handled under the \n26 \nframework of the existing rules than under an โunenumeratedโ (that is, non-existent) rule.โ  \n27  Id. \n \n28  8 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 9 of 13\n \n \n1  existing and generally available administrative remedies effectively unavailable to him.  \n2  Id.  But as required by Jones, the ultimate burden of proof remains with the defendant.  Id.  \n3  C.  Analysis \n4    Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a complaint on September 11, 2018.  Dkt. No. \n5  1.  The Court dismissed the original complaint after finding it improperly joined unrelated \n6  claims against unrelated defendants in violation of Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal \n7  Rules of Civil Procedure.  Dkt. No. 7.  Among the claims, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant \n8  Clawson failed to protect him during an assault by several inmates, during which \n9  Defendant shot Plaintiff with his block gun.  Dkt. No. 1 at 7.  Plaintiff repeated this claim \n10  against Defendant Clawson in his first amended complaint, Dkt. No. 10 at 6, and again in \n11  his second amended complaint, Dkt. No. 19 at 4.  He raised it again in the third amended \n12  complaint on March 6, 2020.  Dkt. No. 29 at 4.      \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    Defendant asserts that Plaintiffโs pleadings show that he initiated Californiaโs \nCfi\n tclaC 14  administrative exhaustion process after commencing this lawsuit.  Dkt. No. 32 at 4.  In \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  doing so, Defendant asserts Plaintiff failed to satisfy exhaustion requirements as mandated \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by the Ninth Circuit.  Id.  Defendant acknowledges that there is a limited exception for \nS de nre 17  claims by a prisoner exhausted before the filing of an amended complaint under Rhodes v. \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  Robinson, 621 F.3d 1002, 1005 (9th Cir. 2010).  Id.  However, Defendant asserts that the \n19  exception only applies to newly added claims, and Plaintiffโs claims against Defendant \n20  Clawson are not newly added since he raised them in his original complaint, prior to when \n21  Plaintiff exhausted them.  Id.   \n22  In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that he submitted multiple appeals and complaints \n23  which โprison appeal coordinator has repeatedly rejected/canceled violating plaintiffโs due \n24  process and right to redress off grievance, thereby finalizing exhaustion.โ  Dkt. No. 42 at 2.  \n25  He asserts that despite prison officials repeatedly obstructing his inmate complaint process, \n26  he continued in good faith to exhaust his remedies.  Id.  Plaintiff submits copies of the \n27 \n \n28  9 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 10 of 13\n \n \n1  grievances that show that he exhausted his remedies at the second level prior to initial \n2  filing of the civil complaint.  Id., Ex. A.   \n3  In reply, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffโs supporting documents filed with his \n4  opposition further substantiate Defendantโs position.  Dkt. No. 44 at 1.  Defendant points \n5  out that the prison officials found the second-level response to Plaintiffโs administrative \n6  appeal constituted exhaustion of the prisonโs administrative remedies.  Id., citing Dkt. No. \n7  42 at 10.  Defendant asserts that the second level response was issued on November 6, \n8  2018, but Plaintiff filed this action on September 11, 2018.  Dkt. No. 44 at 1, citing Dkt. \n9  No. 42 at 11-13; Dkt. No. 1.  Therefore, Defendant asserts that this action must be \n10  dismissed.  Dkt. No. 44 at 2.     \n11  After carefully considering all the pleadings and construing the facts in the light \n12  most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds Plaintiff clearly failed to exhaust administrative \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  remedies prior to filing this lawsuit.  There is no dispute that Plaintiff initiated this action \nCfi\n tclaC 14  on September 11, 2018, and that the original complaint contained the failure to protect \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  claim against Defendant Clawson.  Dkt. No. 1.  Accordingly, the claim is not a newly \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  added claim that was exhausted before Plaintiff filed the third amended complaint on \nS de nre 17  March 6, 2020, such that the exception under Rhodes, 621 F.3d at 1005, would apply.  It is \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  also not disputed that Plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies on November 6, 2018, \n19  when the second level of appeal issued its decision.  Dkt. No. 42 at 10.  Plaintiff alleges in \n20  the third amended complaint that the first level of appeal was concluded on October 15, \n21  2018, and the second level was concluded on November 6, 2018.  Dkt. No. 29 at 7.  \n22  Plaintiffโs opposition attaches the appeal documents, further confirming the dates of his \n23  appeals.  Dkt. No. 42 at 10.  Both the third amended complaint and Plaintiffโs own \n24  documents demonstrate that exhaustion was completed nearly two months after Plaintiff \n25  filed this action on September 11, 2018.  Dkt. No. 1.  An action must be dismissed unless \n26  the prisoner exhausted his available administrative remedies before he filed suit, even if \n27 \n \n28  10 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 11 of 13\n \n \n1  the prisoner fully exhausts while the suit is pending.  See McKinney, 311 F.3d at 1199.  \n2  Accordingly, Defendant has shown that there was an available administrative remedy and \n3  Plaintiff did not exhaust that available administrative remedy before he filed this action.  \n4  See Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172; see id. at 1176.   \n5  In response, Plaintiff must show that that there was something in his particular case \n6  that made existing and generally available administrative remedies unavailable to him.  See \n7  Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172.  In opposition, he claims that prison officials obstructed his \n8  inmate complaint process.  See supra at 10.  However, the papers submitted by Plaintiff \n9  show that he was able to submit an inmate grievance eleven days after the incident on \n10  August 25, 2018, alleging that the โcorrectional officer fired his gun and shot [Plaintiff] on \n11  the lower right side of [his] body towards [his] buttocksโ and seeking disciplinary action \n12  against this officer.  Dkt. No. 42 at 7-8.  This grievance was assigned Log No. SQ-A-18-\n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  02997.  Id.  Three days later on August 28, 2018, the grievance was returned to Plaintiff \nCfi\n tclaC 14  because he had exceeded the allowable number of appeals filed in a 14 calendar day \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  period; he was advised to wait until September 12, 2018, to file another appeal.  Dkt. No. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  42 at 18.  Plaintiff resubmitted the appeal, which was again screened out at the first level \nS de nre 17  on September 26, 2018, because the issue was obscured.  Dkt. No. 42 at 17.  Plaintiff was \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  able to submit the appeal a third time, at which point it was accepted and assigned to a first \n19  level responder on October 10, 2018.  Id. at 7.  This series of events does not indicate that \n20  prison officials were obstructing Plaintiffโs inmate process, but rather that Plaintiff was \n21  failing to comply with grievance procedures.  He was given several opportunities to \n22  remedy the deficiencies and was able to proceed with the appeal once he had complied.  \n23  Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to show that there was something in his \n24  particular case that made existing and generally available administrative remedies \n25  unavailable to him.  See Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172.  Rather, Plaintiff was merely impatient \n26  with the process and prematurely filed this action on September 11, 2018, immediately \n27 \n \n28  11 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 12 of 13\n \n \n1  after the appeal was first returned to him on August 28, 2018.  In fact, the original \n2  complaint was signed on August 29, 2018, the day after the inmate grievance was returned \n3  to him the first time.  Dkt. No. 1 at 3.  There is no evidence that prison officials were \n4  preventing Plaintiff from exhausting administrative remedies, and the papers submitted by \n5  Plaintiff show that he was in fact able to exhaust administrative remedies while this action \n6  was pending.  Had he simply been patient a few months and followed the matter through \n7  the various levels of review, Plaintiff would not be facing dismissal now.     \n8  Based on the foregoing, Defendantโs motion to dismiss the claims against him for \n9  failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit is GRANTED.  See \n10  McKinney, 311 F.3d at 1199; see Vaden, 449 F.3d at 1051 (where administrative remedies \n11  are not exhausted before the prisoner sends his complaint to the court it will be dismissed \n12  even if exhaustion is completed by the time the complaint is actually filed).   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tclaC 14  CONCLUSION \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  For the forgoing reasons, the Court orders as follows:  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  1.  Based upon an initial screening, the new claims in the third amended \nS de nre 17  complaint against Defendants Warden Ron Davis and the Director of the CDCR based on \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  supervisor liability, as well as the unrelated claims against unnamed defendants, are \n19  DISMISSED without leave to amend.  See supra at 3-6.  The Clerk shall terminate these \n20  Defendants from this action.   \n21  2.  Defendant Clawsonโs motion to dismiss the Eighth Amendment claim \n22  against him is GRANTED for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  Dkt. No. 32.  \n23  All claims against him, in his individual and official capacities, are DISMISSED without \n24  prejudice.   \n25  The Clerk shall close the file.   \n26  This order terminates Docket No. 32. \n27 \n \n28  12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 51   Filed 12/02/20   Page 13 of 13\n \n \n1     IT IS SO ORDERED. \n2  Dated:  _December 2, 2020____      ________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n3 \nUnited States District Judge \n \n4 \n \n \n5   \n \n \n6   \n \n7   \n \n \n8   \n \n \n9 \n \n \n10   \n \n \n11   \n \n \n12 \na   \ntr in  \nuoro 13   \nCfi  \n tla  \ncC 14 \ni  \nrts fo  \niD tc 15   \n sir  \netattsiD 16    \nS d nr   \nee 17 \nth  \nintr  \nUo\nN 18   \n \n \n19 \n \n \n20   \n \n \n21   \n \n \n22 \n \n \n23   \n \n \n24 \n \n \n25  Order Granting Def;s MTD  \nPRO-SE\\BLF\\CR.18\\05558Saddozai_grant-MTD(exh) \n26 \n27 \n \n28  13 ",

The Court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend for Plaintiff to file \n20  an amended complaint that complies with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of \n21  Civil Procedure.  (Docket No. 7.)  Plaintiff has filed an amended complaint.  (Docket No. \n22  10.)   \n23   \n24  DISCUSSION \n25  A.  Standard of Review \n26    A federal court must conduct a preliminary screening in any case in which a \n27  prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a \n28  governmental entity.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(a).  In its review, the court must identify any \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 2 of 5\n \n \n1  cognizable claims and dismiss any claims that are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim \n2  upon which relief may be granted or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune \n3  from such relief.  See id. ยง 1915A(b)(1),(2).  Pro se pleadings must, however, be liberally \n4  construed.  See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).   \n5    To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a plaintiff must allege two essential \n6  elements: (1) that a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States was \n7  violated, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under the \n8  color of state law.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). \n9  B.  Plaintiffโs Claims  \n10  Plaintiffโs original complaint was problematic because it contained unrelated claims \n11  against different individuals at SQSP based on separate incidents that occurred during July, \n12  August, September 2018.  (Docket No. 7 at 2.)  In granting leave to amend, the Court \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  advised Plaintiff that an amended complaint must contain โonly related claims against the \nCif\nct Cal 14  appropriate Defendantsโ to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of \nstriof \nDict  15  Civil Procedure.  (Id. at 3.)  However, the amended complaint does not remedy this defect.   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Plaintiff claims that on July 30, 2018, when he arrived at SQSP, he was placed into \nS \ned ern 17  a single man cage for over ten hours in unsanitary conditions and without toilet access, in \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Am. Compl. at 4.)  Plaintiff \n19  also claims that Defendant Malikian destroyed his legal and personal correspondence โto \n20  obstruct his access to the courts,โ and that Defendant Malikian also threatened to beat and \n21  batter Plaintiff because he โdoes not like his kind of people,โ in violation of First, Sixth, \n22  Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Id.)  Plaintiff also claims that on August 14, \n23  2018, he was shot at by Officer Clawson during an altercation with other inmates, and that \n24  this use of deadly force was โout of retaliation for complaining.โ  (Id. at 6.)  Plaintiff also \n25  claims that after he was transferred to protective custody, he was repeatedly denied access \n26  to the law library, religious services, mental health services, cleaning supplies, soap, clean \n27  clothing and linen exchanges, among other deprivations, in violation of his First, Sixth, \n28  2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 3 of 5\n \n \n1  Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Id. at 8.)   \n2  โA party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, \n3  as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party.โ  \n4  Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a).  Accordingly, โmultiple claims against a single party are fine, but \n5  Claim A against Defendant 1 should not be joined with unrelated Claim B against \n6  Defendant 2.โ  George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007).  โUnrelated claims \n7  against different defendants belong in different suits,โ not only to prevent the sort of \n8  โmorassโ that a multi-claim, multi-defendant suit can produce, โbut also to ensure that \n9  prisoners pay the required filing fees โ for the Prison Litigation Reform Act limits to 3 the \n10  number of frivolous suits or appeals that any prisoner may file without prepayment of \n11  required fees.โ  Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(g)).   \n12  The amended complaint contains multiple claims against different defendants at \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  SQSP.  These claims and defendants are not all related to each other and do not all arise \nCif\nct Cal 14  out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.  Fed. R. \nstriof \nDict  15  Civ. P. 20(a)(2).  โA buckshot complaint that would be rejected if filed by a free person โ \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  say, a suit complaining that A defrauded plaintiff, B defamed him, C punched him, D \nS \ned ern 17  failed to pay a debt, and E infringed his copyright, all in different transactions โ should be \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  rejected if filed by a prisoner.โ  George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) (noting \n19  that, in prisoner complaint seeking to join 24 defendants and approximately 50 distinct \n20  claims, prisoner made no effort to show that 24 defendants he named had participated in \n21  the same transaction or series of transactions or that a question of fact is common to all \n22  defendants).  Plaintiffโs amended complaint is such a โbuckshot complaint,โ and should be \n23  rejected.  Id.    \n24  Accordingly, the Court finds that the multiple claims against multiple defendants at \n25  SQSP are improperly joined in this single action.  In the interest of justice, Plaintiff shall \n26  be granted one final opportunity to file a second amended complaint containing only \n27  related claims against properly joined Defendants.  This being Plaintiffโs second \n28  3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 4 of 5\n \n \n1  opportunity to correct this deficiency, no further opportunities shall be given if he again \n2  fails to comply with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) in the second amended complaint.   \n3  C.    Pending Motion \n4  Plaintiff was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis (โIFPโ) under 28 U.S.C. ยง \n5  1915, with an initial filing fee of $43.15 being immediately due and fees thereafter to be \n6  paid as were available in Plaintiffโs prisoner account.  (Docket No. 6.)  The initial filing \n7  fee was calculated at 20 percent of $215.75, which was the amount indicated on the \n8  Certificate of Funds in Prisonerโs Account as both the average deposit each month to \n9  Plaintiffโs prisonerโs account for the most recent six-month period and the average balance \n10  in the prisonerโs account each month for the same six-month period.  (Docket No. 2-1 at \n11  1.)  Plaintiff has filed an application for the total filing fee of $350 to be waived or \n12  modified.  (Docket No. 13.)  \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  Section 1915 permits indigent prisoner plaintiffs to proceed in a civil action without \nCif\nct Cal 14  the prepayment of filing fees, but still requires that the entire filing fee be paid.  In granting \nstriof \nDict  15  Plaintiffโs IFP motion, the Court found that Plaintiff showed an ability to pay an initial \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  partial filing fee pursuant to ยง 19159(B)(1).  (Docket No. 6 at 1.)  The prison trust account \nS \ned ern 17  office was instructed to take funds for the remainder of the filing fee from Plaintiffโs \nth\nnirt\nUNo 18  account in accordance with ยง 19159(B)(1), and instructions were provided.  (Id. at 1-2.)  \n19  The Court finds no further modification of this order regarding payment of fees is \n20  warranted.  Accordingly, Plaintiffโs application is DENIED.   \n21   \n22  CONCLUSION \n23  For the foregoing reasons, the Court orders as follows:  \n24  1.   Plaintiffโs application for modification or reduction of the filing fee is \n25  DENIED.  (Docket No. 13.)  \n26  2.   The amended complaint is DISMISSED with leave to amend.  Within \n27  twenty-eight (28) days of the date this order is filed, Plaintiff shall file a second amended \n28  4 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-05558-BLF   Document 15   Filed 07/11/19   Page 5 of 5\n \n \n1  complaint that complies with Rules 18(a) and 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n2  Procedure.
