If such a preference is implemented, Homeless \n5  Persons shall only be subject to reasonable requirements to demonstrate residency.  Homeless \n6  Persons cannot be denied admission to the Housing Site on the basis that Pallet Shelters are \n7  reserved for other Homeless Persons who have been or will be subject to Enforcement efforts by \n8  the City or referrals by the City or third parties with one exception. That exception is that the \n9  City may reserve, or cause to be reserved, the number of Pallet Shelters needed to provide \n10  shelter to the number of Homeless Persons identified in any notice served on Plaintiffsโ Counsel \n11  pursuant to Paragraph 10(c) and/or (d) of this Agreement until such Enforcement has concluded.    \n12  b.

Occupants shall not be required to participate in any programs or services as a \n27 \ncondition of admission or remaining at the Housing Site. The City and/or the Housing Site \n28 \noperator may provide voluntary programs on site.  \n \n9 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  g.

Anyone who is denied admission to reside in the Housing Site shall receive a written \n6 \n7  notice stating the reason for denial and the grievance procedure for challenging the denial.  \n8  j.  When the City or Housing Site operator believes there is grounds to expel an occupant, \n9 \nthe City and/or Housing Site operator must provide, or cause to be provided written notice and \n10 \nan opportunity to cure the alleged conduct, unless the conduct is so extreme that it has put or \n11 \nlikely will put other occupants or staff at immediate physical harm and the risk cannot be \n12 \n13  reasonably mitigated. \n14  k.  The City shall ensure, or cause to be ensured, that all occupants of the Housing Site are \n15  offered voluntary case management to provide assistance with securing permanent housing, \n16  employment and income benefits, health care (both physical and mental), treatment for \n17  substance use, assistance with legal issues and transportation. \n18  7.

Each Plaintiff shall be offered a Pallet \n25  Shelter at the Housing Site, and the City must reserve, or cause to be reserved, eight Pallet Shelters for \n26  Plaintiffs for two months after the date the Housing Site opens. Plaintiffs may accept a Pallet Shelter \n27  and move into the Pallet Shelter upon the Housing Site opening and for two months from that date.  \n28  9.

The City shall not require a \n \n10 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Homeless Person to relocate from Public Property and/or Enforce its Anti-Camping Ordinances and \n2  Regulations until the Housing Site is open and available to admit Homeless Persons. Once the Housing \n3  Site is open, the City may only require Homeless Persons to relocate from Public Property and Enforce \n4  the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  \n5  10.  Notice and Individual Assessment Prior to Enforcement of Anti-Camping Ordinances \n6  and Regulations. Any requirement that a Homeless Person relocate themselves or their personal \n7  property from Public Property and/or Enforcement of the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations \n8  against a Homeless Person will be preceded by notice to Plaintiffsโ counsel, contacts with Outreach and \n9  Engagement Staff, and an Individual Assessment as follows: \n10  a.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties or pursuant to a decision as part of the dispute \n11  resolution procedure outlined in Paragraph 16 of this Agreement, the Torres Community Shelter \n12  (Torres Shelter) and the Housing Site are the only shelter locations that can be counted to \n13  determine if there are sufficient shelter beds for the City to begin Enforcement in accordance \n14  with the terms of this Agreement. The Torres Shelter is a congregate shelter located at 101 \n15  Silver Dollar Way, Chico, CA 95928. The Partiesโ understanding of the Torres Shelter as of the \n16  time of signing this agreement is as follows: The Torres Shelter is a year-round congregate \n17  shelter that allows occupants to remain at the site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The Torres \n18  Shelter is available to men and women who are homeless, does not require participation in a \n19  religious or other program as a prerequisite to admission or to remain at the shelter, and allows \n20  one service or companion animal per person. The Torres Shelter provides three meals a day, and \n21  shower and laundry facilities to occupants. Occupants sleep in bunk beds in a dormitory. There \n22  is one dormitory for women and one for men. The Torres Shelter also provides sleeping \n23  accommodations on mats.   \n24  b.  The City must count, or cause to be counted, the number of Homeless Persons staying \n25  on the designated Public Property it wishes to relocate Homeless Persons from and/or Enforce \n26  the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations, and confirm that, prior to the actions below, \n27  there are at least the same number of Pallet Shelters available at the Housing Site and/or beds \n28  available at the Torres Shelter.  The City may not count spaces on a mat at the Torres Shelter as \n \n11 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  available. The City may only count, or cause to be counted, one available bed per unoccupied \n2  Pallet Shelter at the Housing Site.  However, whenever the number of Homeless Persons at the \n3  designated Public Property subject to relocation and/or Enforcement exceeds the number of \n4  unoccupied Pallet Shelters, the City may count an unoccupied bed in a Pallet Shelter provided \n5  that the City has a reasonable basis to believe that Homeless Person(s) in question would \n6  voluntarily agree to reside together in the particular Pallet Shelter. The City may not require a \n7  Homeless Person to share a Pallet Shelter with another Homeless Person. Plaintiffs reserve the \n8  right to dispute that there is enough shelter to begin relocation and/or Enforcement, including \n9  when the City counts beds in occupied Pallet Shelters. \n10  c.  Upon conducting the count of Homeless Persons and confirming there are sufficient \n11  open Pallet Shelters at the Housing Site and beds at the Torres Shelter to accommodate all of the \n12  Homeless Persons on the designated Public Property, the City shall provide written notice to \n13  Plaintiffsโ counsel at least 7 days prior to issuing the notices required to Homeless Persons in \n14  Paragraph 10(f) of this Agreement. The notice to Plaintiffsโ Counsel shall state: 1) the exact \n15  location of Public Property of the planned Enforcement; 2) the number of Homeless Persons the \n16  City determined are currently residing at that location; 3) the date the City plans to provide the \n17  notices required in Paragraph 10(f); 3) the number of open Pallet Shelters at the Housing Site \n18  and the number of open shelter beds at the Torres Shelter by gender (if the Pallet Shelters and/or \n19  beds are restricted to a particular gender and the Torres Shelter is able to provide such \n20  information with respect to its beds); and 4) the name, phone number, and email of a contact at \n21  both shelter sites that Plaintiffsโ counsel can contact to verify the shelter information.  Plaintiffsโ \n22  counsel shall keep this notice and its contents confidential, but are not precluded from \n23  investigating the information in the notice.  If Plaintiffsโ counsel dispute within 7 days of \n24  receiving the notice that there are sufficient open Pallet Shelters and beds for the City to begin \n25  the planned Enforcement, Plaintiffsโ counsel shall initiate the dispute resolution process in \n26  Paragraph 16 of this Agreement. The City must stay Enforcement at the designated location \n27  until the dispute resolution process concludes. \n28  d.  When the City serves a notice on Plaintiffsโ Counsel pursuant to Paragraph 10(c) of this \n \n12 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Agreement, and the notice designates a Public Property with 5 or fewer Homeless Persons, the \n2  City may serve the notice three business days prior to issuing the notices required to Homeless \n3  Persons in Paragraph 10(f) of this Agreement.  \n4  e.  The City may only serve Plaintiffsโ Counsel one notice pursuant to Paragraphs 10 (c) \n5  and/or (d) of this Agreement at a time, and cannot serve a subsequent notice until all of the time \n6  periods for all notices required by Paragraph 10 of this Agreement have expired.  The City may \n7  include up to three Public Properties within a single notice so long as the total number of \n8  Homeless Persons at multiple locations does not exceed fifty (50).  If a single Public Property is \n9  identified in a notice, there shall be no limit on the number of Homeless Persons who may be \n10  subject to relocation.   \n11  f.  The City must then provide, or cause to be provided, a notice to all Homeless Persons \n12  staying on the designated Public Property the City wishes to close and/or Enforce its Anti-\n13  Camping Ordinances and Regulations at least 7 days before the City issues, or causes to be \n14  issued, a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification or takes any other action to Enforce its Anti-\n15  Camping Ordinances and Regulations.  This notice must explain the Individual Assessment \n16  process.  The notice shall state the Homeless Persons may contact Legal Service of Northern \n17  California at 530-345-9491, chico-office@lsnc.net, or 541 Normal Ave, Chico, California \n18  95928 for information about their legal rights during this process.   \n19  g.  The O&E Staff must meet with all Homeless Persons at the Public Property noticed for \n20  Enforcement to conduct an Individual Assessment and provide written notice to the Homeless \nPerson of the outcome of the Individual Assessment. The Individual Assessment must occur when \n21 \nor after notice required in Paragraph 10(f) is issued, and at least prior to the date the City issues, \n22 \nor causes to be issued, a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification or takes any other action to \n23 \nEnforce its Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations as to that person. O&E Staff may provide \n24 \nHomeless Persons information about, and referrals to, any permanent, transitional, and emergency \n25 \nhousing space available, and make voluntary referrals to such housing. However, if the Homeless \n26 \nPerson declines any of the above, the O&E must assess whether an open Pallet Shelter at the \n27  Housing Site or bed at the Torres Shelter is an Appropriate Shelter Space, as defined in Paragraph \n28  10(h) of this Agreement, for the individual.  \n \n13 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  h.  A  Pallet  Shelter  at  the  Housing Site  and/or  a bed  at  the  Torres  Shelter  is  not  an \n2  โAppropriate Shelter Spaceโ for an individual when:  \ni.  The shelter cannot accommodate the personโs physical and/or mental disabilities;  \n3 \nii.  The shelterโs hours and/or other policies unreasonably impair or otherwise unreasonably \n4 \nhinder a personโs ability to work, engage in other income generating activities, and/or attend \n5 \nschool; \n6 \niii. In the case of a family unit, the family would have to be involuntarily separated into two \n7 \nor  more  different  rooms  or  units,  but  a  family  unit  may  voluntarily  accept  such  an \n8 \narrangement;  \n9  iv. The  individual  would  be  disqualified  from  accessing  the  shelter  space  due  to  any \n10  restrictions, rules or covenants beyond their reasonable use or control, such as having a pet \nthat the shelter does not allow;  \n11 \nv.  The shelter space requires mandatory participation in a religious or other program as a \n12 \nprerequisite to access or use the shelter space; \n13 \nvi. The shelter space only offers a mat, and not a bed for sleeping; or  \n14 \nvii. The shelter space cannot provide the appropriate single-gender placement for someone \n15 \nwho reasonably objects to mixed-gender placement. \n16 \ni.  The following procedures apply to Individual Assessments: \n17  i.  It shall be conducted at the then-current location of the Homeless Person, or any other \n18  location convenient for the Homeless Person. \n19  ii.  Chico Police Department or other law enforcement may be present at the general location \nwhere O&E Staff are meeting with Homeless Persons but they must remain far enough away \n20 \nfrom O&E Staff and Homeless Persons to ensure that the Individual Assessment remains \n21 \nprivate and outside the immediate presence of law enforcement unless O&E staff requests law \n22 \nenforcementโs presence due to safety concerns or law enforcement determines that they need \n23 \nto intervene for safety reasons. \n24 \niii. O&E  Staff  must  meet  with  the  Homeless  Person  more  than  once  to  complete  the \n25  Individual Assessment, if necessary.  \n26  iv. The Homeless Person may have one advocate or representative attend the Individual \n27  Assessment.  \nv.  O&E Staff must document all attempts to meet with a Homeless Person during the 7-day \n28 \nO&E process.  If O&E Staff documents that it was at the Homeless Personโs location at least \n \n14 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  five days during the 7-day O&E period and made a good faith attempt each day to conduct an \n2  Individual Assessment of that person, O&E Staff does not need to make any further attempts \nto conduct an Individual Assessment for that person. O&E Staff must leave a notice on the \n3 \nHomeless Personโs property or in the area the person is known to stay that 1) it attempted to \n4 \ncontact the Homeless Person, 2) provides the dates and times of the attempted contacts, 3) \n5 \ninforms that Homeless Person they can still get an Individual Assessment by contacting O&E \n6 \nStaff, and 4) provides how to contact O&E Staff.  \n7 \nj.  If O&E Staff determines there is an Appropriate Shelter Space at Torres Shelter or the \n8 \nHousing Site for the Homeless Person, O&E Staff will provide the homeless person written notice \n9  of the Appropriate Shelter Space.  \n10  k.  If the Homeless Person accepts the Appropriate Shelter Space at the Torres Shelter or \nHousing Site, the O&E Staff will provide or arrange for transportation to the placement, if needed.  \n11 \nl.  If the Homeless Person declines the Appropriate Shelter Space offered, the City may issue \n12 \na 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification upon the expiration of the 7-day notice required in \n13 \nParagraph 10 (f). If the individual relocates within the 72 hours, then they will not be cited or \n14 \narrested for violating the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations.  If the individual fails to \n15 \nrelocate, then the individual may be issued a citation or, subject to this Agreement, placed under \n16 \ncustodial arrest for the violation. \n17  m.  If the O&E Staff determine through the Individual Assessment that there is not an \n18  Appropriate Shelter Space for a Homeless Person, the City may not Enforce its Anti-Camping \n19  Ordinances and Regulations against the Homeless Person.

Except as specified below in Paragraphs 11(c) and (d), Defendants shall not seize any \n19  personal property that is attended, unattended, or believed to be abandoned on public \n20  property in violation of applicable City ordinance(s) without first providing a written pre-\n21  removal notice at least 72 hours in advance of the seizure that is posted prominently at the \n22  location of the personal property, and if possible, provided to the apparent owner of the \n23  personal property.  \n24  A.  The pre-removal notice shall provide: \n25  1)  A general description of the personal property to be removed;  \n26  2)  A description of the geographic location or area that is sufficient for a \n27  reasonable person to understand the location or area within which personal property \n28  will be subject to removal;  \n \n16 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  3)  The date and time the notice was posted;  \n2  4)  A statement that the personal property has been stored on public property in \n3  violation of the applicable City ordinance(s) with citations to those ordinances; \n4  5)  A statement that the personal property may be relocated or stored if not \n5  removed from public property within 72 hours;  \n6  6)  The address where removed personal property will be stored; \n7  7)  A telephone number through which a person may receive information as to \n8  stored personal property; \n9  8)  The daily schedule when a person may retrieve their personal property; \n10  9)  A statement that stored personal property may be destroyed if not claimed \n11  within ninety (90) calendar days after storage; and \n12  10)  A statement that property determined to be an imminent threat to health and \n13  safety may be destroyed. \n14 \niii.

STORAGE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY \n4  i.  Except as specified below in Paragraphs 11(c) and (d), Defendants shall not destroy \n5  seized personal property, regardless of its value, without first storing the property at a secure \n6  location designated by Defendants and for a period of no less than ninety (90) calendar days.  \n7  ii.

Defendants may relocate, but not remove and store, personal property stored on public \n23  property in the following circumstances without prior written notice: \n24  A.  Personal property that substantially obstructs or prevents Defendantsโ \n25  performance of construction, maintenance, repair, or landscaping operations on Public \n26  Property, including structures, streets, sidewalks, parking lots, parks, and open spaces; \n27  and \n28  B.  Personal property obstructing any operational and useable entrance, exit, \n \n18 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  driveway, or loading dock. \n2  ii.  When Defendants relocate personal property without prior written notice in the \n3  circumstances described above, they shall prominently post and date a โPersonal Property \n4  Relocation Noticeโ either at the exact location from which the personal property was \n5  relocated or as close as possible to that location and prominently post a copy of that notice at \n6  the new location of the personal property. The notice shall provide the following \n7  information: \n8  A.  A general description of the relocated personal property;  \n9  B.

A phone number the owner of the personal property may call to request \n12  assistance in relocating their personal property if the propertyโs current location may \n13  cause a greater hardship to the owner than its prior location due to the ownerโs disability \n14  or disabilities; and \n15  E.  For personal property relocated due to construction, maintenance, repair, or \n16  landscaping operations, the notice shall include a phone number that the personal \n17  property owner may call for assistance from Defendants in returning their personal \n18  property to its original location.  \n19  d.  ITEMS NOT SUBJECT TO RELOCATION, SEIZURE, AND STORAGE \n20  PROCEDURES \n21  i.  Personal property may be seized and/or destroyed without being subject to the above \n22  relocation, removal, and storage procedures under any of the following circumstances: \n23  A.  The property presents a health or safety risk, such as toxic sharps, chemicals, and \n24  bedding or clothing that is soiled by infectious materials, human waste, body fluids, \n25  mold or mildew; \n26  B.  The property is infested by rodents or insects;  \n27  C.  The property is evidence of a crime, or is contraband; or \n28  D.  The property owner confirms in writing that they are abandoning the property. \n \n19 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  ii.  Trash, garbage, and/or debris may be destroyed and are not subject to the above \n2  relocation, seizure, and storage procedures. \n3  e.  DOCUMENTATION \n4  i.  The City must document and maintain, or cause to be documented and maintained, \n5  records of compliance with the terms and conditions of Paragraph 11 of this Agreement.  \n6  12.  Public Sanitary Facilities. The City shall not close or fence off any public bathrooms, \n7  toilets, and sinks located on Public Property so as to make such public facilities unavailable to \n8  Homeless Persons, except that such facilities may be closed temporarily for maintenance or repairs. \n9  Such closure shall only be for the time needed for the applicable maintenance or repairs. If such \n10  facilities are closed due to damage and the cost of repair is too costly for the City to repair and reopen, \n11  the City may provide mobile toilets and handwashing stations in lieu of making such repairs in the \n12  same quantity as the closed facilities and in the same general location.   The City shall not cause water \n13  to be cut off to any water fountain located on Public Property, or restrict access to such water fountains \n14  so as to make them unavailable to Homeless Persons, unless and only for the time required for \n15  maintenance and repairs.  It is the Partiesโ understanding that the City has not closed public sanitary \n16  facilities for the purpose of making the same unavailable to Homeless Persons, but rather to repair and \n17  maintain damaged public sanitary facilities.  The intent of this provision is simply to balance Homeless \n18  Personsโ interest in keeping public sanitary facilities open against the Cityโs interest in reducing the \n19  costs required to maintain and repair the same.  \n20  13.  Dismissals of Citations and Charges related to Homelessness against Plaintiffs. Within \n21  30 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the City shall file a request for dismissal and/or take \n22  any other appropriate action to dismiss all administrative and criminal citations, charges, and cases \n23  against Plaintiffs that relate to Plaintiffsโ status as a homeless individual. The City shall take all action \n24  needed, but only to the extent it is able, to dismiss the citations, charges, cases, and remove any \n25  warrants and fines, whether owed to the City, the Superior Court of California, Butte County, Butte \n26  County Central Collections, or any other agency or entity related to the citation or charges. The cases \n27  subject to this paragraph include: \n28  a.  Bobby Warren (case nos. 18CI03014, 18TR04448, 18CI06895,19CI00183, 19CI06356, \n \n20 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  and 20CI02971); \n2  b.  Christa Stevens (case nos. 18TR02787, 19CI06410, and 19CI06426);  \n3  c.  Michael Samuelson (case nos. NT239654 (2013), NT238935 (2013), NT238269 (2013), \n4  NT237637 (2013), NT230336 (2013), 18TR02923, and 19CI06360); and \n5  d.  Carol Beth Thompson (Case Nos. 18CI05620 and 17TR10367, and citation (AKA Chico \n6  Police Department Notice to Appear) number 300659 issued on December 28, 2021).  \n7  e.  If Plaintiffs discover any additional administrative and/or criminal citations, charges, \n8  and cases that should be dismissed pursuant to this Paragraph, Plaintiffsโ Counsel shall notify \n9  the City of the additional cases and request dismissal. The Cityโs failure to dismiss any \n10  administrative and/or criminal citations, charges, and cases relating to Plaintiffsโ status as a \n11  homeless person that are not specifically identified here or subsequently identified shall not \n12  constitute a breach of this Agreement.  \n13  14.  Damages. The City shall pay Plaintiffs a total of $12,000, comprising payment for \n14  Plaintiffsโ claims for damages.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the City shall \n15  deliver, or cause to be delivered, a check for $12,000 payable to Legal Services of Northern California, \n16  at Legal Services of Northern California, 541 Normal Avenue, Chico, CA 95928. \n17  15.  Attorneysโ Fees and Costs. The City shall pay Plaintiffsโ counsel a total of $650,000, \n18  comprising payment for Plaintiffsโ claims for attorneysโ fees and costs.  Within 30 days of the Effective \n19  Date of this Agreement, the City shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, a check for $650,000 payable to \n20  Legal Services of Northern California, at Legal Services of Northern California, 541 Normal Avenue, \n21  Chico, CA 95928.  This payment of $650,000 does not apply to any additional fees and costs that might \n22  be subsequently awarded to Plaintiffsโ counsel pursuant to Paragraph 16(g) below.  \n23  16.  Dispute Resolution.  Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman (โJudge Newmanโ) will retain \n24  jurisdiction over the Action until five years from the Effective Date for purposes of overseeing \n25  implementation, enforcement and/or modification of this Agreement through the dispute resolution \n26  process described below. Plaintiffsโ counsel may present disputes in the dispute resolution process \n27  which not only affect Plaintiffs but any other aggrieved Homeless Person in the City.  The dispute \n28  resolution process does not apply to any dispute between Plaintiffs and other Homeless Persons, on the \n \n21 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  one hand, and the City, on the other hand, other than alleged violations of the Anti-Camping \n2  Ordinances and Regulations and this Agreement. \n3  a.  Should a dispute arise over the implementation, enforcement or modification of the \n4  Agreement, the Parties will first attempt to meet and confer informally with the other side to \n5  resolve the matter in good faith.  Such attempt will at least involve (a) a communication from \n6  the party initiating the dispute to the other sideโs counsel describing in detail the dispute and the \n7  requested remedy and providing any available evidence in relation thereto; and (b) a discussion \n8  either in person or by telephone seeking to resolve the dispute. \n9  b.  If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute, then within five court days after \n10  completing the meet and confer process outlined above, the Party initiating the dispute shall \n11  request an informal conference before Judge Newman to resolve the matter by contacting Judge \n12  Newmanโs Courtroom Deputy via e-mail. \n13  c.  If the informal conference before Judge Newman does not resolve the dispute, then the \n14  Party initiating the dispute may thereafter file a motion to implement, enforce or modify the \n15  Agreement in accordance with the standards and processes to be set by Judge Newman, and \n16  Judge Newman will have jurisdiction to resolve that dispute.  If the Dispute involves an \n17  emergency situation that presents a threat to the immediate health and safety of an individual, \n18  the parties may seek expedited review by Judge Newman.  \n19  d.  The initiation of the dispute resolution process does not affect the Cityโs right to enforce \n20  any laws other than the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations. If a pending dispute \n21  brought by Plaintiffsโ Counsel involves Plaintiff(s) or other Homeless Person(s), the City agrees \n22  that no citation or custodial arrest will subsequently be made for violating an Anti-Camping \n23  Ordinance or Regulation arising from an individualโs status as a Homeless Person until the \n24  dispute resolution process is concluded.  Once the dispute resolution process is concluded \n25  regarding an issue, the City is not required to engage in a subsequent dispute resolution process \n26  regarding the same issue. \n27  e.  In resolving any dispute, Judge Newman may enforce any rights available to a Party \n28  under this Agreement, subject to sufficient notice, opportunity to be heard, briefing, evidence, \n \n22 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  and other due process.  Judge Newman may award damages (other than punitive damages), \n2  other monetary relief, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other relief, if appropriate, to \n3  any Party or Homeless Person as a result of any dispute submitted to the dispute resolution \n4  process.  Judge Newman shall make the final determination on any motion and no right of \n5  appeal shall exist. \n6  f.  Nothing in this Agreement limits the ability of Plaintiffs or other Homeless Persons to \n7  seek damages and/or other monetary relief, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other type \n8  of relief in other proceedings not subject to this Agreement.   \n9  g.  Judge Newman will have discretion to award reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs \n10  against Defendants if Plaintiffsโ counsel prevail on any dispute, whether it was resolved by \n11  motion or through the informal conference with Judge Newman.  Judge Newman may issue \n12  sanctions if a determination is made that Plaintiffsโ counsel, Defendantsโ counsel, or Defendants \n13  have not acted in good faith or with substantial justification in bringing or opposing any dispute \n14  subject to the dispute resolution process.    \n15  h.  If Judge Newman becomes unavailable to resolve disputes during the Courtโs five-year \n16  jurisdiction period, Judge Newman will designate another judge with the Partiesโ consent to \n17  serve in his place. In the event of Judge Newmanโs replacement, either Plaintiffs or Defendants \n18  may determine that they will not agree that the designated judge shall make the final \n19  determination on any motions brought to implement, enforce, or modify the Agreement without \n20  a right of appeal and Paragraph 16(e) shall be modified accordingly. \n21  17.  No Guarantee.  Nothing in this Agreement constitutes a promise, representation, or \n22  warranty by City that any number of beds will be available to any particular Homeless Person at any \n23  time. \n24  18.  Release and Covenant Not to Sue by Plaintiffs.  In consideration for the terms of this \n25  Agreement, Plaintiffs Bobby Warren, Andy Lambach, Jonathon Williams, Michael Samuelson, Tracy \n26  Miller, Tona Petersen, Carol Beth Thompson, Christa Stevens, and each of them, on their own behalf, \n27  (the โReleasing Plaintiffsโ), hereby release and forever discharge the City, City of Chico Police \n28  Department, as well as their present and former employees, agents, managers, officers, directors, \n \n23 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  council members, insurance companies, attorneys, departments, and divisions or affiliated entities, \n2  whether previously or hereafter affiliated in any manner (the โReleased City Partiesโ), from and against \n3  any and all claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, attorneysโ fees and costs, and \n4  liabilities, arising from or relating to the events detailed in the lawsuit of any nature whatsoever, \n5  whether or not now known, suspected, or claimed, which the Releasing Plaintiffs, and/or any of them, \n6  have, or ever may claim to have, as against the Released City Parties, or any of them, whether directly \n7  or indirectly, relating to or arising out of (a) the Action, (b) any claims raised in, or that could have \n8  been raised in, the Action, (c) the availability of the Housing Site, Pallet Shelters, beds, and/or other \n9  homeless accommodations, (d) the Cityโs alleged obligation to provide and/or fund such \n10  accommodations, and/or (e) the Cityโs alleged inability to Enforce any of the Anti-Camping Ordinances \n11  and Regulations (including, without limitation, to any law that the Releasing Plaintiffs claim \n12  criminalizes a personโs homeless status), against any person because of his or her homeless status (the \n13  โReleased Plaintiff Claimsโ). \n14  a.  The release set forth above is a release of ALL claims, demands, causes of action, \n15  obligations, damages, and liabilities, of any nature whatsoever, and is intended to encompass all \n16  known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, claims that are possessed by the Releasing \n17  Plaintiffs and within the scope of the Released Plaintiff Claims based solely and only on the \n18  events giving rise to this Action.  To effectuate the intent of the Parties, the Releasing Plaintiffs \n19  expressly agree to waive and relinquish all rights and benefits they may have under California \n20  Civil Code section 1542, which reads as follows: \n21  SECTION 1542.  A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS \n22  THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR \n23  SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING \n24  THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE \n25  MATERIALLY  AFFECTED  HIS  OR  HER  SETTLEMENT  WITH  THE \n26  DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. \n27  b.  The Releasing Plaintiffs, and each of them, warrant that they have made no assignment, \n28  and will make no assignment, of any claim, chose in action, right of action, or any right, of any \n \n24 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  kind whatsoever, within the scope of the Released Plaintiff Claims, and that, as far as they \n2  know, no other person or entity of any kind had or has any interest in any of the demands, \n3  obligations, actions, causes of action, debts, liabilities, rights, contracts, damages, attorneysโ \n4  fees, costs, expenses, losses, or claims within the scope of the Released Plaintiff Claims. \n5  19.  Release and Covenant Not to Sue by Defendants.  In consideration for the terms of this \n6  Agreement, Defendants City, City of Chico Police Department, and each of them, on their own behalf, \n7  (the โReleasing Defendantsโ), hereby release and forever discharge Plaintiffs Bobby Warren, Andy \n8  Lambach, Jonathon Williams, Michael Samuelson, Tracy Miller, Tona Petersen, Carol Beth Thompson \n9  and Christa Stevens, their respective heirs, family members, executors, administrators, successors, \n10  attorneys, agents, representatives, insurance companies and assigns, whether previously or hereafter \n11  affiliated in any manner (the โReleased Plaintiffsโ), from and against any and all claims, demands, \n12  causes of action, obligations, damages, attorneysโ fees and costs, and liabilities, arising from or relating \n13  to the events detailed in the lawsuit of any nature whatsoever, whether or not now known, suspected, or \n14  claimed, which the Releasing Defendants, and/or any of them, have, or ever may claim to have, as \n15  against the Released Plaintiffs, or any of them, whether directly or indirectly, relating to or arising out \n16  of (a) the Action, (b) any claims raised in, or that could have been raised in, the Action, and (c) the \n17  availability of the Housing Site, Pallet Shelters, beds, and/or other homeless accommodations, and (d) \n18  any prior administrative or criminal citations for violations of C.M.C. ยงยง 9.20.030, 9.20.050, 9.44.015, \n19  9.44.018, 9.44.010, 9.43.030, 9.50.030 (B)-(E), 12.18.430, 12.18.450, 12R.04.340, and/or 12R.04.370, \n20  including:  Butte County Superior Court Case numbers 20CI02971, 19CI06356, 18TR04448, \n21  19CI00183, 18CI06895, 18CI03014, 19CI06426, 19CI06410, 18TR02787, 19CI06360, 18TR02923, \n22  NT239654, NT238935, NT238269, NT237637, NT230336, 18CI05620, and 17TR10367 (the \n23  โReleased Defendant Claimsโ). \n24  a.

To effectuate the intent of the Parties, the Releasing \n \n25 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Defendants expressly agree to waive and relinquish all rights and benefits they may have under \n2  California Civil Code section 1542, which reads as follows: \n3  SECTION 1542.  A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS \n4  THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR \n5  SUSPECT  TO  EXIST  IN  HIS  OR  HER  FAVOR  AT  THE  TIME  OF \n6  EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, \n7  WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT \n8  WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. \n9  b.  The Releasing Defendants, and each of them, warrant that they have made no \n10  assignment, and will make no assignment, of any claim, chose in action, right of action, or any \n11  right, of any kind whatsoever, within the scope of the Released Defendant Claims, and that, as \n12  far as they know, no other person or entity had or has any interest in any of the demands, \n13  obligations, actions, causes of action, debts, liabilities, rights, contracts, damages, attorneysโ \n14  fees, costs, expenses, losses, or claims within the scope of the Released Defendant Claims.  \n15  However, the foregoing warranty does not apply to the following cases which have already been \n16  referred out to Butte County Central Collections:  Butte County Superior Court Case numbers \n17  20CI02971, 19CI06356, 18TR04448, 19CI00183, 18CI06895, 18CI03014, 19CI06426, \n18  19CI06410, 18TR02787, 19CI06360, 18TR02923, NT239654, NT238935, NT238269, \n19  NT237637, NT230336, 18CI05620, and 17TR10367.

Non-Admission of Liability.  By entering into this Agreement, the City admits no liability, \n25  and explicitly denies any liability or wrongdoing of any kind arising out of or relating to any of the \n26  claims alleged in the Action.  Nothing herein constitutes an admission by the City as to any \n27  interpretation of laws, or as to the merits, validity, or accuracy of any of the claims or legal contentions \n28  made in the Action.  The City entered into this Agreement solely to avoid the time, expense, and risk of \n \n26 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  continued litigation.  The Parties agree that an express condition of this settlement is that there has been \n2  no finding of liability on the merits, and that this settlement and any document related to this \n3  settlement, including this Agreement and the Order, and the negotiations leading up to this settlement, \n4  are inadmissible in evidence and cannot be used for any purpose in this or any other proceeding except \n5  in an action or proceeding to approve, interpret, or enforce the Agreement. \n6  22.

Plaintiffs, and each of them, further specifically represent that, before signing this \n12  Agreement, they have conferred with counsel of their choice to the extent desired concerning the legal \n13  effect of this Agreement, and that the legal effect of this Agreement has been adequately explained to \n14  them. \n15  23.

ECF 1. On April 11, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a First \n5  Amended Complaint alleging that Defendants unlawfully enforced a citywide web of local laws \n6  that imposed criminal penalties on people experiencing unsheltered homelessness when they \n7  sleep, sit, lie down, and rest in public in violation of, among other things, the Fourth, Eighth, and \n8  Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and California civil rights laws. ECF \n9  34. Defendants have denied all material allegations in the First Amended Complaint. ECF 86. \n10  On April 11, 2021, this Court granted the Temporary Restraining Order restraining and \n11  enjoining Defendants from enforcing or threatening to enforce laws regulating camping, entering \n12  and remaining, and storing personal property on public property. ECF 37. On July 8, 2021, this \n13  Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Defendants continuing the same terms previously \n14  set forth in the Temporary Restraining Order. ECF 110. \n15  Following extensive discussions, the Parties subsequently reached a settlement resolving \n16  the disputed claims in this Action. A copy of the fully executed Settlement Agreement \n17  (โSettlement Agreementโ) is attached hereto as Exhibit A, the terms of which are expressly \n18  incorporated herein by reference. \n19  The Court hereby expressly retains jurisdiction to resolve any future disputes regarding \n20  the interpretation, performance, or enforcement of the Settlement Agreement for a period of five \n21  (5) years from the date of dismissal. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 381 \n22  (1994); Flanagan v. Arnaiz, 143 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir. 1998). \n23  NOW THEREFORE, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), and good \n24  cause appearing therefore, the Court HEREBY ORDERS AND DECREES the following: \n25  1.  The Courtโs Preliminary Injunction dated July 8, 2021, is hereby dissolved in its entirety. \n26  2.  This Order expressly incorporates all of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, attached \n27  as Exhibit A, into this Order, including and expressly, all nonmonetary terms set forth in \n28  the Settlement Agreement. \n  3   \nSTIPULATED ORDER REGARDING SETTLEMENT, DISMISSAL AND CONTINUING JURISDICTION \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1    3.  The Court expressly retains exclusive jurisdiction for a period of five (5) years from the \n \n2    date of entry of this Order to enforce the Settlement Agreement, and refers this matter to \n \n3    Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman to resolve any futu re disputes pursuant to the \n4  Dispute Resolution procedures in the Settlement Agreement regarding interpretation, \n5  performance, or enforcement of the Settlement Agreement, including and expressly, \n6  nonmonetary terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement. \n7  4.  Except as provided otherwise in the Settlement Agreement, each side shall bear their own \n8  fees and costs in this Action.  \n9  5.

Kimberly J. Mueller \nDefendants. \n21     \n22   \n23  This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffsโ ex parte motion for temporary restraining \n24  order. All Parties were given notice. Having considered the papers filed in support of Plaintiffsโ \n25  motion for a temporary restraining order, and any opposition thereto, for good cause shown, the \n26  Court hereby enters the following Order:  \n27   \n28 \n  1   \n[Proposed] Order Regarding Temporary Restraining Order (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 32   Filed 04/11/21   Page 2 of 3\n \n \n \n1  The Court finds that a temporary restraining order is warranted pursuant to Federal Rule of \n \n2  Civil Procedure 65 and Civil Local Rule 231. Plaintiffs have carried their burden of demonstrating \n3  that they are likely to succeed on the merits, that they would be irreparably harmed in the absence \n4  of a temporary restraining order, that the equities weigh in favor of granting the requested \n5  temporary restraining order, and that the temporary restraining order would not be against the \n6  public interest. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have no other adequate legal remedy to preserve \n7  the status quo.  \n8  This order is based, in part, on a finding that there are not enough available emergency \n9  shelter beds or other emergency shelter for the number of unhoused persons in Chico, California.  \n10  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for a temporary restraining \n11  order is GRANTED. The Court orders as follows: \n12  1.  Defendants City of Chico and Chico Police Department, their agents, servants, employees \n13  and attorneys and those in active concert or participation with them are restrained and \n14  enjoined from the following, pending this Courtโs resolution of Plaintiffโs Motion for \n15  Preliminary Injunction: \n16  a.  Enforcing or threatening to enforce the 72-Hour Illegal Encampment \n17  Notifications dated April 8, 2021 at 12 p.m. at Comanche Creek Green \n18  Way in Chico, California;  \n19  b.  Issuing or enforcing any other 72-Hour Illegal Encampment Notifications \n20  as to unhoused persons on public property in Chico, California;  \n21  c.  Enforcing or threatening to enforce the Chico Municipal Code sections \n22  listed in the April 8, 2021 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification, which \n23  are Municipal Code sections 12R.04.340, 12.18.430,  9.20.010  through \n24  9.20.060; and 9.50.030.  Enforcement and threat of enforcement of ยง \n25  9.20.030 (Unlawful Camping) is only restrained on public property. \n26  Enforcement and threat of enforcement of ยง 9.50.030 is limited to  ยงยง \n27  9.50.030 (B) -(E) (Waterways Ordinance - Camping, Staying, Storage of \n28  Personal Property, Entering and Remaining);  \n  2   \n[Proposed] Order Regarding Temporary Restraining Order (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 32   Filed 04/11/21   Page 3 of 3\n \n \n \n1  d.   Enforcing or threatening to enforce California Penal Code ยง 647(c), which \n \n2  is listed on the April 8, 2021 at 12 p.m. Illegal Encampment Notification; \n3  and \n4  e.  Destroying property of unhoused persons seized by Defendants even if \n5  Defendants value the property at $100 or less and/or determine it is not of \n6  reasonable value. \n7  2.  There is no cost to Defendants and Plaintiffs are indigent, unhoused persons, so no \n8  security bond is required.  \n9  3.   Since this Temporary Restraining Order was granted on ex parte notice, Defendants may \n10  apply to the court for modification or dissolution on two days' notice or such shorter \n11  notice as the court may allow.  \n12   \n13  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n14   \n15  DATE and TIME_________  \n16        \n17   \n          ___________________________________________ \n18  Hon.
