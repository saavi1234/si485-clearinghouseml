    "summary": "<p>On September 18, 2024 four individuals incarcerated at Tyger River Correctional Facility filed suit against South Carolina&rsquo;s Department of Corrections, alleging breach of contract, breach of contract accompanies by fraud, unjust enrichment, detrimental reliance and violation of South Carolina&rsquo;s Unfair Trade Practices Act and South Carolina&rsquo;s Payment of Wages Act. Plaintiffs filed suit in South Carolina&rsquo;s Court of Common Pleas Seventh Judicial Circuit seeking damages. They were represented by Winslow Law LLC. The case was assigned to Bryan Sterling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs participate in South Carolina&rsquo;s Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (&ldquo;PIECP&rdquo;) which places incarcerated individuals in realistic work environments, pays them prevailing wages and gives them a chance to develop marketable skills that will increase their potential for rehabilitation and meaningful employment upon release. On March 24, 2021 the South Carolina Supreme Court held that under PIECP, inmates are to be paid prevailing wages, not the minimum wage. However, for their work in the PIECP program, plaintiffs have only been paid minimum wage. They assert that the prevailing wage for their work is much higher. Moreover, plaintiffs assert that the Department of Corrections deducts social security, room and board and voluntary child support from their pay, but any voluntary child support payments were not actually paid to the inmates&rsquo; family.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs also sought to certify a class action for similarly situated individuals. Their motion for class certification was granted on January 13, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Present at the virtual hearing were counsel for Plaintiffs  R\nG\n -\n C\nand Defendant.   O\nM\nM\nAfter consideration of the pleadings, motion, memorandums, and arguments of counsel,  O\nN\n P\nL\nthis Court hereby grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify Class pursuant to South Carolina Rules of  E\nA\nS\n -\nCivil Procedure Rule 23.    C\nA\nS\nE\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  #\n2\n0\n2\n4\nThe  Prison  Industry  Enhancement  Certification  Program  (hereinafter  “PIECP”)  is  a  C\nP\n4\n2\nlegislative program that certifies local or state prison industry programs meet all the necessary  0\n3\n7\n8\n0\nrequirements to be exempt from federal restrictions on prisoner-made goods in interstate \ncommerce. (Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) | Overview | Bureau \nof Justice Assistance (ojp.gov)). PIECP programs place people who are incarcerated in realistic \nwork environments, pay them prevailing wages, and give them a chance to develop marketable \nskills that will increase their potential for rehabilitation and meaningful employment on release. \n(Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) | Overview | Bureau of Justice \nAssistance (ojp.gov)). Prevailing Wage is  defined as the average wage paid  to  similarly \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\nemployed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment. (US Department  IC\nA\nL\nL\nof Labor). South Carolina Code §24-3-430 provides that inmates must receive the “prevailing  Y\n F\nIL\nE\nwage” for their salaries while employed in the private sector.   D\n -\n 2\n0\nOn or about March 24, 2021, the State of South Carolina’s Supreme Court issued an opinion  2\n5\n J\na\nin Thomas J. Torrence v. South Carolina Department of Corrections agreeing with the South  n 1\n3\n 3\nCarolina Court of Appeals determination that Mr. Torrence was to be paid the prevailing wage,  :2\n7\n P\nM\nnot minimum wage, as an inmate employed by Defendants. PIECP is “an effective way to   -\n S\nP\nA\naddress idleness among ever-increasing prison populations and as a cost-efficient method for  R\nT\nA\nN\nproviding  inmates  with  marketable  job  skills.  Taxpayers  benefit  because  PIECP  wage  B\nU\nR\nG\ndeductions result in reductions in incarceration costs. Inmate wages benefit society, generally, \n -\n C\nO\nin that deducted amounts are authorized to address victim compensation, inmate family support  M\nM\nO\nneeds and taxes.” (PIECP Final Guideline).  N\n P\nL\nE\nDefendants participate in the PIECP program and allow their inmates to be gainfully  A\nS\n -\n C\nemployed through the program. Defendants contract with numerous companies under the  A\nS\nE\n#\nPIECP program. At Tyger River Correctional Facility Defendants have a contract with Shaw  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\nIndustries Group, Inc. As part of this contract, Defendants employ inmates, in the private sector,  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\nto perform jobs such as woodworker and inspector tester sorter and weigher. Defendants are  7\n8\n0\npaying inmates minimum wage, seven dollars and twenty-five cents ($7.25) an hour rather than \nthe required prevailing wage.  \nThe prevailing wage varies depending on the position employed. For instance, the prevailing \nwage for a woodworker is sixteen dollars and thirty-six cents ($16.36) and for an inspector tester \nsorter and weigher it is twenty dollars and fifty-three cents ($20.53). Defendants further deduct \nsocial security from inmates’ gross pay. Inmates can voluntarily deduct child support from their \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\ngross pay. If an inmate does not have child support deducted from their gross pay, Defendants  IC\nA\nL\nL\nwill deduct a fee for room and board.   Y\n F\nIL\nE\nDefendants have provided minimal compensation to numerous inmates as a result of their  D\n -\n 2\n0\nfailure to pay them the proper wages. As part of these compensation payments, Defendants are  2\n5\n J\na\ndeducting  social  security,  room  and  board  and/or  voluntary  child  support.  However,  the  n 1\n3\n 3\nvoluntary  child  support  payments  are  not  being  paid  to  the  inmates’  family.  Despite  :2\n7\n P\nM\ncompensating numerous inmates for Defendants’ failure to pay the prevailing wage Defendants   -\n S\nP\nA\ncontinue to pay the compensated inmates minimum wage for their continued employment.   R\nT\nA\nN\nThe issue presented in this matter is so abundant and effects so many individuals that to file  B\nU\nR\nG\nindividual actions would create a massive hardship on the Courts. The glaring fact that we are \n -\n C\nO\nfaced with is that so many individuals that have and are working under the PIECP program in  M\nM\nO\nDefendant SCDC, including women and men inmates, released inmates, and the estates of  N\n P\nL\nE\ndeceased inmates, all have valid claims against Defendants for improper payment of wages.   A\nS\n -\n C\nANALYSIS  A\nS\nE\n#\n  If a lawsuit meets [the prerequisites of Rule 23], certification as a class action serves  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\nimportant public purposes. In addition to promoting judicial economy and efficiency, class  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\nactions also ‘afford aggrieved persons a remedy if it is not economically feasible to obtain relief  7\n8\n0\nthrough the traditional framework of multiple individual damage actions.’ Gunnells v. \nHealthplan Servs. Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 424. The courts should address motions for Class \nCertification liberally. Knight v. Lavine, 2012 U.S. Dist. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 13778, quoting \nGunnells, 348 F.3D at 424. \nUnder Rule 23(a), the party seeking class certification must demonstrate: (1) the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the  IC\nA\nL\nL\nclaims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately  Y\n F\nIL\nE\nprotect the interests of the class. Plaintiffs satisfy each of these requirements.   D\n -\n 2\n0\nPlaintiffs have identified one hundred class members to date. These class members do not  2\n5\n J\na\ninclude the additional inmates, released individuals, women inmates, and individuals represented  n 1\n3\n 3\nby other firms. The class members are geographically disbursed throughout the United States and  :2\n7\n P\nM\npotentially further, making joinder impracticable. Although Rule 23(a)(1) requires the class to be   -\n S\nP\nA\nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, “[n]o consistent standard has been  R\nT\nA\nN\ndeveloped for establishing numerosity in class actions.” Ballard v. Blue Cross of Southern W.  B\nU\nR\nVa., Inc., 543 F.2d 1075, 1080 (4th Cir. 1976)(citing Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and  G\n -\n C\nO\nProcedures §1762 (1972)).   M\nM\nO\nNumerosity is to be considered in light of all the circumstances of the case, and unless an  N\n P\nL\nE\nabuse of discretion is shown, the trial court’s decision on the issue is final. Cypress v. Newport  A\nS\n -\n C\nNews General and Nonsectarian Hospital Assoc., 375 F.2d 648, 653 (4th Cir. 1967). When  A\nS\nE\n#\ndeciding whether joinder is impractical, the courts consider many factors such as “the size of the  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\nclass, the nature of the action, the location of the class members, the expediency of joinder, and  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\nthe practicality of multiple lawsuits.” Jeffreys v. Communications Workers of America AFL- 7\n8\n0\nClio, 212 F.R.D. 320, 322 (E.D. Va. 2003).  \nUnder the circumstances of this action, given that there are one hundred known individual \nclass members to date, individual lawsuits no doubt would result in unduly expensive and \nrepetitive discovery, and it may be difficult for many individuals, specifically those no longer \nincarcerated, to obtain relief in the absence of an award of class relief. Therefore, the \nrequirement of numerosity has been satisfied.  \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\nWith regards to commonality, all individual class members have been and/or are currently  IC\nA\nL\nL\nincarcerated in Defendant SCDC and worked under the PIECP program. Each of these  Y\n F\nIL\nE\nindividuals have been improperly paid by Defendant SCDC. While some of them have been  D\n -\n 2\n0\ngiven compensation for the incorrect wage pay, Defendant SCDC continues to improperly pay  2\n5\n J\na\nthe individuals still working under the PIECP program. The issue at hand for each of these  n 1\n3\n 3\nindividual class members is specifically are they due the prevailing wage for their employment  :2\n7\n P\nM\nunder the PIECP program while incarcerated in Defendant SCDC? Based on the fact that all   -\n S\nP\nA\nindividual class members have the same common claims against Defendant SCDC, Plaintiffs  R\nT\nA\nN\nhave meet the requirement of commonality.  B\nU\nR\nG\n“The Rule 23(a) requirements of commonality and typicality tend to merge analytically. In \n -\n C\nO\ngeneral, commonality requires that there be ‘questions of law or fact common to the class’, and  M\nM\nO\ntypicality requires that ‘the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the  N\n P\nL\nE\nclaims or defenses of the class.’” In Re Mills Corp. Sec. Litig., 257 F.R.D. 101, 105 (E.D. Va.  A\nS\n -\n C\n2009). “The essence of the typicality requirement is captured by the notice that ‘as goes the  A\nS\nE\n#\nclaim of the named plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.’” Deiter v. Microsoft Corp., 436 F.3d  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\n461, 466 (4th Cir. 2006)(citing Broussard v. Meineke Discount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d  P\n4\n2\n0\n331, 340 (4th Cir. 1998)). However, this does not mean that the Plaintiff’s claims and those of the  37\n8\n0\nabsent class members must be perfectly identical or perfectly aligned. Deiter, 436 F.3d at 467. \nAll individual members of the class have suffered the same damages, that of improper wage \npay. Therefore, all class member’s claims arise from the same or similar actions and conduct of \nDefendant SCDC. Defendant SCDC intentionally paid the individual inmates minimum wage \nrather that the statutorily and court ordered prevailing wage. All class members will have valid \nclaims of unpaid wages and breach of contract against Defendant SCDC.  \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\nThe class representatives and counsel must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the  IC\nA\nL\nL\nclass. SCRCP Rule 23(a)(4). “The purpose of the adequacy requirement is to ensure that there  Y\n F\nIL\nE\nare not potential ‘conflicts of interest between the named parties and the class they seek to  D\n -\n 2\n0\nrepresent.” DiFelice v. U.S. Airways, Inc., 235 F.R.D. 70, 79 (E.D. Va. 2006)(citing Amchem  2\n5\n J\na\nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997)).  n 1\n3\n 3\nThere are no conflicts in this action due, not only to the overwhelming commonality of the  :2\n7\n P\nM\nclaims, but also to the fact that Defendant SCDC owed each individual inmate a duty to ensure   -\n S\nP\nA\nproper payment and therefore, owes each individual class member lost wages. Plaintiffs and each  R\nT\nA\nN\nclass member have the same interest in enforcing the prevailing wage statute and recovering  B\nU\nR\nG\nunpaid wages from Defendant SCDC. \n -\n C\nO\nPlaintiffs are adequate class representatives as they understand the issues in this litigation and  M\nM\nO\nare willing to represent the class. They have demonstrated that they will vigorously prosecute  N\n P\nL\nE\nthis case on behalf of the class and will be actively involved in the case and they will  A\nS\n -\n C\ncommunicate regularly with the class counsel. Plaintiffs do not have interests antagonistic to the  A\nS\nE\n#\nother class members, nor do they have any unique claims or defenses that might undermine the  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\nefficient resolution of the Class claims.   P\n4\n2\n0\n3\nIn addition to being adequate representatives, Plaintiffs have retained competent counsel well  7\n8\n0\nversed in class actions, complex litigation, and lost wage claims. Plaintiffs’ counsel has devoted \nsubstantial attention to identifying and investigating potential claims in this action. They have \nresearched and drafted a class action complaint, prepared a motion for class certification, \nmemorandum of law in support of the class certification, and prepared a memorandum of law in \nopposition to Defendants’ Motion for Dismissal. Counsel’s actions have demonstrated their \ncommitment of the time and resources necessary to develop and prepare this case for trial and to \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\nadequately represent the Class members. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ have satisfied the prerequisite of  IC\nA\nL\nL\nadequate representation and Plaintiffs’ counsel should be appointed as class counsel.  Y\n F\nIL\nE\nIn addition to meeting the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the Plaintiffs must satisfy one of the  D\n -\n 2\n0\nrequirements of Rule 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(b)(1). SCRCP Rule 23(b)(1)  2\n5\n J\na\nprovides a class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: (b)(1) prosecuting  n 1\n3\n 3\nseparate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of: (A) inconsistent  :2\n7\n P\nM\nor varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish   -\n S\nP\nA\nincompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or (B) adjudications with  R\nT\nA\nN\nrespect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the  B\nU\nR\nG\ninterests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially \n -\n C\nO\nimpair or impede their ability to protect their interests.   M\nM\nO\nUnder Rule 23(b)(1)(B) because “prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class  N\n P\nL\nE\nmembers would create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a  A\nS\n -\n C\npractical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the  A\nS\nE\n#\nindividual adjudications, or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\ninterests.” This action clearly meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) as the rulings in this  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\naction could hold precedence over other inmate’s individual similar actions should a class not be  7\n8\n0\ncertified.  \nFurther, Rule 23(b)(2) which provides for certification if: the party opposing the class has \nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief \nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. “[T]here are \ntwo basic factors which must be present under Rule 23(b)(2): (1) the opposing party’s conduct \nmust be ‘generally applicable’ to the class and (2) final injunctive or corresponding declaratory \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\nrelief must be requested for the class.” McGlothin v. Connors, 142 F.R.D. 626, 640 (W.D. Va.  IC\nA\nL\nL\n1992). “It is only necessary that the actions ‘affect all persons similarly situated so that [the] acts  Y\n F\nIL\nE\napply generally to the whole class.” Id.  D\n -\n 2\n0\nIn this action, Defendant SCDC’s conduct similarly affects all class members. Every  2\n5\n J\na\nindividual class member has been incorrectly paid minimum wage rather than the statutorily  n 1\n3\n 3\ndefined prevailing wage. Defendant SCDC’s actions are applicable to the entirety of the class.  :2\n7\n P\nM\nShould Plaintiffs succeed on their claims, breach of contract and the Court declare that   -\n S\nP\nA\nDefendant SCDC has breached their contract and improperly paid the individual inmates, then  R\nT\nA\nN\nappropriate declaratory and equitable relief will flow to all the class members.   B\nU\nR\nG\nCONCLUSION \n -\n C\nO\nTherefore, for the reasons set forth above, the Court, construing the evidence and all  M\nM\nO\ninferences therefrom, concludes Plaintiffs are entitled to Class Certification pursuant to Rule 23,  N\n P\nL\nE\nPlaintiffs are appointed as class representatives and Plaintiffs’ counsel is hereby appointed as  A\nS\n -\n C\nclass counsel. Furthermore, due to the class certification class members are hereby no longer  A\nS\nE\n#\nrequired to pursue any administrative process, including but not limited to the Grievance  2\n0\n2\n4\nC\nProcess, as all Class Members claims for lost wages will hereby be heard directly under this  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\naction. It is therefore,  7\n8\n0\nORDERED, that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED. \n \nAND IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n                         \n                ________________________________________ \n                The Honorable Judge Jessica Salvini     \n_____________, 2025 \nSpartanburg, South Carolina \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nN\nIC\nA\nL\nL\nY\n F\nIL\nE\nD\n -\n 2\n0\n2\n5\n J\na\nn\n 1\n3\nSpartanburg Common Pleas  3\n:2\n7\n P\nM\n -\nCase Caption: Damon  Jones , plaintiff, et al VS   South Carolina Department Of  S\nP\nCorrections , defendant, et al A\nR\nCase Number: 2024CP4203780 T\nA\nN\nB\nType: Order/Class Certification U\nR\nG\n -\n C\nO\nM\nSo Ordered M\nO\nN\nJessica A.

Plaintiffs are incarcerated adult individuals in Defendant SCDC.   C\nP\n4\n2\n2.  Defendant  SCDC  is  an  executive  agency  of  the  State  of  South  Carolina  and  is  0\n3\n7\n8\n0\nresponsible for operating the State of South Carolina’s prisons. Defendant SCDC has \nfacilities located throughout the state. \n3.  The South Carolina Code vests the SCDC Director with exclusive management and \ncontrol of the South Carolina prison system. S.C. Code Ann. §24-1-130. \n4.  The  South  Carolina  Code  charges  the  Director  of  SCDC  with  appearing  for  and \ndefending any actions brought against SCDC. S.C. Code Ann. §24-1-220. \n5.  Defendant Director of SCDC, Bryan P. Stirling, is sued in his official capacity. \nPage 2 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  6.  Upon information and belief, the acts alleged herein are occurring at numerous prisons  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\nunder Defendant SCDC’s control.    F\nIL\nE\n7.  Upon information and belief, this Honorable Court has jurisdiction over the issues set  D\n -\n 2\n0\nforth in this case and personal jurisdiction over the parties herein.   2\n4\n S\ne\np\nFACTS   1\n8\n 1\n8.  The Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (hereinafter “PIECP”) is a  :0\n5\n P\nM\nlegislative program that certifies local or state prison industry programs meet all the   -\n S\nP\nA\nnecessary requirements to be exempt from federal restrictions on prisoner-made goods  R\nT\nA\nN\nin interstate commerce. (Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) |  B\nU\nR\nG\nOverview | Bureau of Justice Assistance (ojp.gov)) \n -\n C\nO\n9.  PIECP programs place people who are incarcerated in realistic work environments, pay  M\nM\nO\nN\nthem prevailing wages, and give them a chance to develop marketable skills that will \n P\nL\nE\nincrease their potential for rehabilitation and meaningful employment on release. (Prison  A\nS\n -\n C\nIndustry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) | Overview | Bureau of Justice  A\nS\nE\n#\nAssistance (ojp.gov))  20\n2\n4\nC\n10. Prevailing Wage is defined as the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\na specific occupation in the area of intended employment. (US Department of Labor).  7\n8\n0\n11. South Carolina Code §24-3-430 provides that inmates must receive the “prevailing \nwage” for their salaries while employed in the private sector.  \n12. On or about March 24, 2021, the State of South Carolina’s Supreme Court issued an \nopinion in Thomas J. Torrence v. South Carolina Department of Corrections agreeing \nwith the South Carolina Court of Appeals determination that Mr. Torrence was to be \npaid the prevailing wage, not minimum wage, as an inmate employed by Defendants.  \nPage 3 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  13. PIECP  is  “an  effective  way  to  address  idleness  among  ever-increasing  prison  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\npopulations and as a cost-efficient method for providing inmates with marketable job   F\nIL\nE\nskills.  Taxpayers  benefit  because  PIECP  wage  deductions  result  in  reductions  in  D\n -\n 2\n0\nincarceration costs. Inmate wages benefit society, generally, in that deducted amounts  2\n4\n S\ne\np\nare authorized to address victim compensation, inmate family support needs and taxes.”   1\n8\n 1\n(PIECP Final Guideline).  :0\n5\n P\nM\n14. Defendants participate in the PIECP program and allow their inmates to be gainfully   -\n S\nP\nA\nemployed through the program.  R\nT\nA\nN\n15. Upon information and belief, Defendants contract with numerous companies under the  B\nU\nR\nG\nPIECP program. At Tyger River Correctional Facility Defendants have a contract with \n -\n C\nO\nShaw Industries Group, Inc. As part of this contract, Defendants employ inmates, in the  M\nM\nO\nN\nprivate sector, to perform jobs such as woodworker and inspector tester sorter and \n P\nL\nE\nweigher.   A\nS\n -\n C\n16. Upon information and belief, Defendants are paying inmates minimum wage, seven  A\nS\nE\n#\ndollars and twenty-five cents ($7.25) an hour rather than the required prevailing wage.   20\n2\n4\nC\n17. Upon information and belief, the prevailing wage varies depending on the position  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\nemployed. For instance, the prevailing wage for a woodworker is sixteen dollars and  7\n8\n0\nthirty-six cents ($16.36) and for an inspector tester sorter and weigher it is twenty dollars \nand fifty-three cents ($20.53)  \n18. Upon information and belief, Defendants further deduct social security from inmates’ \ngross pay. \n19. Upon information and belief, inmates can voluntarily deduct child support from their \ngross pay. \nPage 4 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  20. Upon information and belief, if an inmate does not have child support deducted from  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\ntheir gross pay, Defendants will deduct a fee for room and board.    F\nIL\nE\n21. Upon information and belief, Defendants have provided minimal compensation to  D\n -\n 2\n0\nnumerous inmates as a result of their failure to pay them the proper wages. As part of  2\n4\n S\ne\np\nthese compensation payments, Defendants are deducting social security, room and board   1\n8\n 1\nand/or voluntary child support. However, the voluntary child support payments are not  :0\n5\n P\nM\nbeing paid to the inmates’ family.   -\n S\nP\nA\n22. Upon information and belief, despite compensating numerous inmates for Defendants’  R\nT\nA\nN\nfailure to pay the prevailing wage Defendants continue to pay the compensated inmates  B\nU\nR\nG\nminimum wage for their continued employment.  \n -\n C\nO\n23. Upon information and belief, Defendants actions are intentional, wanton and willful and  M\nM\nO\nN\nwith the intent to deprive inmates of their earned income. \n P\nL\nE\nFACTS AS TO PLAINTIFF DAMON JONES  A\nS\n -\n C\n24.

D\n -\n 2\n0\n52. Despite Defendants paying compensation for their failure to pay Plaintiff Casey the  2\n4\n S\ne\np\nprevailing wage on August 27, 2024, Defendants continue to pay Plaintiff Casey   1\n8\n 1\nminimum wage instead of the prevailing wage.   :0\n5\n P\nM\n53.

Upon information and belief, Plaintiff Casey is not entitled to draw on social security.   B\nU\nR\nG\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n -\n (Breach of Contract)   C\nO\n  M\nM\n55. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the  O\nN\n P\npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that:  L\nE\nA\nS\n56. Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into a contractual relationship, in which the parties   -\n C\nA\nS\nagreed Plaintiffs would be paid the prevailing wage for the position of employment.   E\n#\n2\n0\n2\n57. The agreement was entered into between the parties and that agreement constituted a  4\nC\nP\n4\ncontract.   2\n0\n3\n7\n8\n58. The Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiffs the agreed upon salary for numerous years  0\ndespite knowledge of South Carolina Code §24-3-430 and Torrence v. South Carolina \nDepartment of Corrections.  \n59. The Defendants breached the contract and due to this breach has cost the Plaintiffs over \nFifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) in salary each. \n60. The Defendants are therefore in breach of the parties’ contract. \nPage 8 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  61. The Plaintiffs have suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of the Defendants’  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\nbreach of contract.   F\nIL\nE\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  D\n -\n(Breach of Contract Accompanied by Fraudulent Act)   2\n0\n2\n4\n62. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the   S\ne\np\n 1\npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that:  8 1\n:0\n5\n63. Defendants breached the contract between the parties in the above stated particulars.   P\nM\n -\n S\n64. Upon information and belief, the Defendants were aware of the salaries due to Plaintiffs,  P\nA\nR\nT\nhowever,  Defendants  had  no  intention  of  paying  Plaintiffs  the  legally  required  and  A\nN\nB\nU\nmandated salaries.   R\nG\n -\n65. Defendants have in fact failed to properly compensate Plaintiffs for numerous years.    C\nO\nM\nM\n66. Even when Defendants compensate Plaintiffs and other inmates for their previous failure  O\nN\n P\nto properly compensate them, they continue to knowingly pay minimum wage rather than  L\nE\nA\nS\nthe statutorily based prevailing wage.   -\n C\nA\nS\n67. Upon information and belief, to date, Defendants continue to improperly pay employed  E\n#\n2\n0\n2\ninmates, including Plaintiff Casey, and refuse to reimburse Plaintiffs for the unpaid wages.    4\nC\nP\n4\n68. The Plaintiffs have suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of this fraudulent  2\n0\n3\n7\n8\nact accompanying the breach of contract, including but not limited to treble damages.  0\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Unjust Enrichment) \n69. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that: \nPage 9 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  70. That the parties entered into a contract, whereby Defendants employed Plaintiffs in the  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\nprivate sector through a contract with Shaw Industries Group, Inc. for a salary of the   F\nIL\nE\nprevailing wage for each position of employment.  D\n -\n 2\n0\n71. The  Defendants  received  all  consideration  from  Plaintiffs  throughout  Plaintiffs’  2\n4\n S\ne\np\nemployment, yet Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiffs their entire wage, instead only   1\n8\n 1\npaying them minimum wage and taking deductions for room and board and social security.  :0\n5\n P\nM\n72. As such, upon information and belief, the Defendants have been unjustly enriched by   -\n S\nP\nA\nPlaintiffs employment and Plaintiffs have yet to be properly compensated under South  R\nT\nA\nN\nCarolina Code §24-3-430.   B\nU\nR\nG\n73. Due to Defendant’s failure to fully compensate Plaintiff, the Plaintiff has suffered damages \n -\n C\nO\nas a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ unjust enrichment.  M\nM\nO\nN\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION  \n P\n(Detrimental Reliance)  L\nE\nA\nS\n74. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the   -\n C\nA\nS\npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that:  E\n#\n2\n0\n75. That the parties entered into a contract, whereby Defendants employed Plaintiffs in the  2\n4\nC\nP\n4\nprivate sector through a contract with Shaw Industries Group, Inc. for a salary of the  2\n0\n3\n7\n8\nprevailing wage for each position of employment.  0\n76. That  the  Plaintiffs  relied  upon  Defendants’  assurances  that  Defendants  would  fully \ncompensate Plaintiffs for their employment under state law. \n77. Upon information and belief, Defendants have failed to fully compensate Plaintiffs under \ntheir employment contract and South Carolina Code §24-3-430.  \n78. The Plaintiffs relied on Defendants’ assurances to their determinant and have suffered \ndamages as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ assurances.  \nPage 10 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION  IC\nA\n(Unfair Trade Practices Act Violation)  L\nL\nY\n(§ 39-5-10, et al)   F\n  IL\nE\n79. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the  D\n -\n 2\n0\npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that:  2\n4\n S\ne\np\n80. The Defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive acts that induced the Plaintiffs into   1\n8\n 1\nemployment and working with the Defendants.   :0\n5\n P\nM\n81. The conduct of the Defendants is capable of repetition and is being repeated on a daily   -\n S\nP\nA\nbasis.  R\nT\nA\nN\n82. As a result of the unfair and deceptive acts, the Plaintiffs worked with the Defendants which  B\nU\nR\nG\nhas proximately caused an ascertainable monetary loss amounting to actual damages.   \n -\n C\nO\n83. The violation of the act was willful and therefore an award of treble damages is appropriate.   M\nM\nO\nN\nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n P\n(Violation of SCPWA)  L\nE\nA\n  S\n -\n84. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the   C\nA\nS\nE\npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that:  #\n2\n0\n2\n85. At all times relevant to this action Defendants were the “employer” of Plaintiffs as defined  4C\nP\n4\n2\nby S.C Code Ann. §41-10-10(1).  0\n3\n7\n8\n0\n86. Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  have  adopted  employment  policies  and \nprocedures that set forth the amount of “wages” as defined by S.C. Code Ann. §41-10-\n10(1), that it has paid its recognized employees over the past three (3) years and who are \nsimilarly situated in all material respects as to the Plaintiff. \n87. Defendants have failed to provide the “wages,” as defined by S.C. Code Ann. §41-10-\n10(1), that it owes to Plaintiffs pursuant to its own employment polices and procedures, \nspecifically PIECP.  \nPage 11 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  88. Therefore, Defendants have failed to comply with S.C. Code Ann. §41-10-40 and 50 with  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\nrespect to the Plaintiffs and are in violation of the SCPWA.   F\nIL\nE\n89. Defendants’ failure to comply with S.C. Code Ann. §41-10-40 and 50 was knowingly,  D\n -\n 2\n0\nwillfully and with reckless disregard of clearly applicable South Carolina law requiring it  2\n4\n S\ne\np\nto pay “wages” to Plaintiffs.   1\n8\n 1\n90. Therefore, the Plaintiffs are entitled to payment from Defendants of  wages lost, an  :0\n5\n P\nM\nadditional  payment  equal  to  three  (3)  times  the  wages  lost  as  liquidated  damages,   -\n S\nP\nA\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs, as well as the equitable remedy of an accounting by  R\nT\nA\nN\nthe Defendants to determine what is the amount of compensation owed in unpaid wages to  B\nU\nR\nG\nthe Plaintiffs. \n -\n C\nO\nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION  M\nM\n(Attorney Fees)  O\nN\n91. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the   P\nL\nE\nA\npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that:  S\n -\n C\n92. Pursuant  to  the  Profit  Participation Agreement,  the  prevailing  party  is  entitled  to  a  A\nS\nE\n#\n2\nreimbursement of Attorney Fees.    0\n2\n4\nC\n93. Further, the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act provides for an award of reasonable  P\n4\n2\n0\n3\nattorney’s fees and costs.  7\n8\n0\n94. Furthermore, the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act provides for an award of \nreasonable attorney’s fees.  \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Quantum Meruit ) \n95. The Plaintiffs reiterate, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs, and further allege that: \nPage 12 of 14 \n \n\nE\nL\nE\nC\n \nT\nR\nO\nN\n  96. That the parties entered into a contract, whereby Defendants employed Plaintiffs in the  IC\nA\nL\nL\nY\nprivate sector through a contract with Shaw Industries Group, Inc. for a salary of the   F\nIL\nE\nprevailing wage for each position of employment.
