    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration's authority to suspend congressionally-appropriated federal financial assistance during a review to ensure that the spending accords with Administration priorities.</p>\r\n<p>On January 28, 2025, the National Council of Nonprofits and several other private entities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Represented by Democracy Forward, the plaintiffs alleged that a January 27, 2025 directive from the Office of Management and Budget temporarily suspending nearly all federal financial assistance programs violated the APA. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, declaratory relief, and attorney&rsquo;s fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Loren L. AliKhan.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day the plaintiffs filed the complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (&ldquo;TRO&rdquo;). After a status conference, the court entered an immediate emergency administrative stay of imposition of the funding freeze until 5 pm on February 3, 2025 and set a hearing for February 3 on the plaintiffs' request for a Temporary Restraining Order. 2025 WL 314433.</p>\r\n<p>The Administration rescinded the OMB Directive on January 29, 2025. The next day, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were moot and alternatively lacked merit. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Court held a hearing on the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a TRO and the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss on February 3, 2025. 763 F.Supp.3d 36. On February 4, 2025, Judge Ali Khan denied dismissal and issued a TRO prohibiting the defendants from implementing or trying to reinstate the directives from the January 27 OMB Directive that related to disbursement of funds for open federal funding awards. 2025 WL 368852. In denying the motion to dismiss, the Court pointed to a social media post from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt demonstrating the Administration&rsquo;s continuing commitment to restricting federal funding despite the rescission of the OMB Directive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court further required the defendants to provide written notice of the TRO to all agencies to which the OMB Directive was addressed. On February 5, 2025, the defendants filed a status report certifying that they had complied and that they were not aware of any ongoing implementation of the commands in the January 27 OMB Directive.</p>\r\n<p>After briefing and a hearing, the Court issued a preliminary injunction on February 25, 2025 with terms similar to the February 4 TRO. 775 F.Supp.3d 100.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to clarify the preliminary injunction, arguing that the defendants too narrowly construed the phrase \"all open awards\" when determining which awards the injunction prohibited them from interfering with. The defendants responded on March 7, arguing that the phrase \"all open awards\" referred to those that had already been approved and partially disbursed before January 27.

    "summary_short": "On January 28, 2025, the National Council of Nonprofits and other private entities filed this lawsuit against the Office of Management and Budget and Acting OMB Director Matthew Vaeth in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging a Trump Administration directive suspending nearly all federal financial assistance pending a review to ensure that the spending accords with Administration priorities. The plaintiffs argue that a suspension violates the Administrative Procedure Act. Judge Loran AliKahn entered an emergency administrative stay the same day, preventing the Administration from implementing the funding freeze until February 3, 2025 and setting a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO. The defendants subsequently moved to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs’ claims are moot because the Trump Administration rescinded the funding freeze directive. After the February 3 hearing, the Court issued an order granting the TRO and denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 11 and a hearing on the motion was held on February 20, 2025. The Court issued a preliminary injunction on February 25, 2025. The defendants filed their answer to the complaint on April 14, 2025, and appealed the preliminary injunction on April 25, 2025.",

ECF No. 30, \nat 29-30.  The court found good cause to extend the TRO under Rule 65(b)(2) on February 6, 2025.  \nFeb. 6, 2025 Minute Order.  Plaintiffs, several coalitions of nonprofit organizations, have moved \nfor a preliminary injunction granting similar relief as the TRO.  ECF No. 40.  Upon consideration \nof the parties’ briefs, ECF Nos. 40, 47, 49, an amicus brief from the American Center for Law and \nJustice, ECF No. 48, the oral argument held on February 20, 2025, Feb. 20, 2025 Minute Entry, \nand for the reasons explained below, the court will enter a preliminary injunction.   \n \n1 Although Plaintiffs originally named then-Acting Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget Matthew Vaeth as a defendant, Russell Vought—who was confirmed by the Senate on \nFebruary 6, 2025—“is automatically substituted as a party” in Mr. Vaeth’s place pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 2 of 39\nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nWhile most of the following factual background and procedural history was explained in the \ncourt’s opinion granting the TRO, ECF No. 30, the court recounts the details here for completeness \nand adds developments since the court’s February 3, 2025 hearing, TRO Hr’g, Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  \nA.  Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-13 \nOn January 27, 2025, Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director of OMB, issued a memorandum \ndirecting federal agencies to “complete a comprehensive analysis of all of their Federal financial \nassistance programs to identify programs, projects, and activities that may be implicated by any of \nthe President’s executive orders.”  Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Off. of the President, Temporary \nPause  of  Agency  Grant,  Loan,  and  Other  Financial  Assistance  Programs  (Jan.  27,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/69QB-VFG8 (“OMB Pause Memorandum,” or “M-25-13”), at 2.  The memorandum \nstated that, “[i]n the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies must \ntemporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial \nassistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, \nincluding, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, \nDEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.”  Id.  Additionally, the memorandum directed \nthat “[e]ach agency must pause: (i) issuance of new awards; (ii) disbursement of Federal funds \nunder all open awards; and (iii) other relevant agency actions that may be implicated by the \nexecutive orders, to the extent permissible by law.”  Id. \nThe memorandum defined “Federal financial assistance” as: “(i) all forms of assistance \nlisted in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of this term at 2 [C.F.R. §] 200.1; and (ii) assistance \nreceived or administered by recipients or subrecipients of any type except for assistance received \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 3 of 39\ndirectly by individuals.”  Id. ¶ 17.  This includes all federal assistance in the form of grants, loans, \nloan guarantees, and insurance.  Id. ¶ 18; see 2 C.F.R. § 200.1.2  As relevant executive orders, it \nlisted: \n▪  Protecting the American People Against Invasion (Jan. 20, 2025); \n▪  Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid (Jan. 20, 2025);  \n▪  Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements (Jan. 20, 2025); \n▪  Unleashing American Energy (Jan. 20, 2025); \n▪  Ending  Radical  and  Wasteful  Government  DEI  Programs  and  Preferencing \n(Jan. 20, 2025);  \n▪  Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth \nto the Federal Government (Jan. 20, 2025); and  \n▪  Enforcing the Hyde Amendment (Jan. 24, 2025).  \nOMB Pause Memorandum, at 1-2. \nThe  memorandum  stated  that  “[t]he  temporary  pause  [would]  become  effective  on \nJanuary 28, 2025 at 5:00 PM.”  Id. at 2.  During the pause, agencies were directed to “submit to \nOMB detailed information on any programs, projects[,] or activities subject to [the] pause” on or \nbefore February 10, 2025.  Id. at 2.   \nB.   Complaint, Emergency Hearing, and Administrative Stay \nShortly after noon on January 28, Plaintiffs brought this suit against OMB and Acting \nDirector Vaeth arguing that OMB’s action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), \n5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.  ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs alleged that the implicated federal grants and funding \n“are the lifeblood of operations and programs for many . . . nonprofits, and [that] even a short \n \n2 The memorandum included a footnote stating: “Nothing in this memo should be construed to \nimpact Medicare or Social Security benefits.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 1 n.2. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 4 of 39\npause in funding . . . could deprive people and communities of their life-saving services.”  Id. ¶ 32.  \nThey argued that Defendants’ action was arbitrary and capricious, violated the First Amendment \nof the United States Constitution, and exceeded OMB’s statutory authority.  Id. ¶¶ 43-61.   \nAlong with their complaint, Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order “barring the OMB \nand all of its officers, employees, and agents from taking any steps to implement, apply, or enforce \nMemo M-25-13.”  ECF No. 5, at 18.  Defendants entered an appearance, ECF No. 9, and the court \nheld an emergency hearing at 4:00 p.m. on January 28 to discern the parties’ positions with respect \nto the issuance of a brief administrative stay pending the resolution of Plaintiffs’ request for a TRO, \nJan. 28, 2025 Minute Entry. \nGiven the extreme time constraints of the litigation and the magnitude of the legal issues, \nthe court entered a brief administrative stay to permit the parties to fully brief the TRO motion and \n“buy[] the court time to deliberate.”3  ECF No. 13, at 3 (quoting United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. \n797, 798 (2024) (Barrett, J., concurring)).  The administrative stay was limited in scope and only \nprohibited Defendants “from implementing OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the \ndisbursement of Federal funds under all open awards” until 5:00 p.m. on February 3, 2025.  Id. at \n4-5.  The court also set a hearing on Plaintiffs’ TRO motion for 11:00 a.m. on February 3, 2025.  \nId. at 5. \nC.  Rescission of Memorandum M-25-13 and Aftermath \nOn January 29, the day after the court entered its administrative stay, OMB issued a new \nmemorandum (“M-25-14”) that purported to rescind M-25-13.  See ECF Nos. 18, 18-1.  The new \n \n3 The court issued the administrative stay from the bench shortly before the “temporary pause” of \nfederal funding was set to take effect at 5:00 p.m.  Tr. of Emergency Hr’g, at 23:21-24:5, Nat’l \nCouncil of Nonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025).   \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 5 of 39\nmemorandum consisted of two sentences: “OMB Memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded.  If you have \nquestions about implementing the President’s Executive Orders, please contact your agency General \nCounsel.”  ECF No. 18-1.   \nShortly after this “rescission” was issued, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt \nannounced from her official social media account that the new memorandum was “NOT a \nrescission of the federal funding freeze.”  Karoline Leavitt, X (formerly Twitter) (Jan. 29, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/99C4-5V6G.  Instead, she stated that “[i]t [was] simply a rescission of [OMB \nmemorandum M-25-13].”  Id.  She further explained that the purpose of the rescission was “[t]o \nend any confusion created by the court’s injunction.”  Id.  The entire post may be viewed below: \n \nId.4 \n \n4 The same day, Beatrice Adams moved to intervene on behalf of herself and all others similarly \nsituated.  ECF No. 19.  She sought to dissolve the court’s then-active administrative stay, arguing \nthat child-welfare funding was being used to “facilitate the separation of children from loving \nhomes.”  Id. at 3-4.  Both parties oppose Ms. Adams’s intervention.  ECF Nos. 41, 42.  The court \nwill deny Ms. Adams’s motion.  To the extent she only seeks to challenge the administrative stay, \nMs. Adams’s motion to intervene is now moot.  In any event, Ms. Adams’s claims are too factually \nand legally attenuated from those alleged in Plaintiffs’ complaint, and Defendants are “already \nadequately  representing  the  Government’s  interests  in  ensuring  that  all  federal  funding  is \nadministered appropriately.”  ECF No. 42, at 1. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 6 of 39\nD.  Temporary Restraining Order Phase \nOn January 30, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs’ TRO motion and concurrently \nmoved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  ECF Nos. 20, 21.  Both \nmotions were fully briefed by February 1.  ECF Nos. 24, 25, 26.   \nOn the morning of February 3, 2025, the court held a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \nTRO.  Feb. 3, 2025 Minute Entry.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court explained that it was \ninclined to grant a TRO and deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Tr. of TRO Hr’g, Nat’l Council \nof Nonprofits, at 58:17-59:15, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  Pursuant to the court’s request, \nPlaintiffs submitted a proposed TRO order shortly after the hearing concluded, and Defendants \nresponded to the proposed order by mid-afternoon. \nBefore the administrative stay expired at 5:00 p.m., the court issued a memorandum opinion \nand order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order.  ECF No. 30.  The court \nconcluded that it had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ motion, that the case was not moot following the \npurported “rescission” of the OMB Pause Memorandum, and that Plaintiffs had met the heavy \nburden of showing that they were entitled to a temporary restraining order.  Id. at 6-29.  Specifically, \nthe court found that Plaintiffs had demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on their arbitrary \nand capricious claim because “Defendants . . . offered no rational explanation for why they needed \nto freeze all federal financial assistance—with less than twenty-four-hours’ notice—to ‘safeguard \nvaluable taxpayer resources.’”  Id. at 23 (quoting OMB Pause Memorandum, at 1).5  The court \nfurther determined that Plaintiffs had produced evidence that they would suffer irreparable injury \nin the absence of emergency relief because “the funding freeze threaten[ed] the lifeline that keeps \n \n5 While the court did not fully address Plaintiffs’ other two claims (that Defendants’ actions were \nin excess of statutory authority and violated the First Amendment), it noted that they had shown \nat least some likelihood of success on both.  ECF No. 30, at 20 n.6.   \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 7 of 39\ncountless organizations operational.”  Id. at 28.  Finally, the court concluded that the “nationwide \npanic” and widespread chaos caused by the impending freeze tipped the public interest heavily in \nfavor of a temporary restraining order.  Id. at 28-29.   \nThe order prohibited Defendants “from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under \na different name the directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement \nof Federal funds under all open awards.”  ECF No. 30, at 29.  Pursuant to the order, Defendants \nsent written notice “to all agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-25-13 was addressed” \ninforming them of the temporary restraining order later that evening.  ECF No. 39, at 1.   \nOn February 6, the court set an expedited preliminary injunction briefing schedule and \nordered the parties to appear for a hearing on February 20 at 11:00 a.m.  Feb. 6, 2025 Minute Order.  \nThe court also extended the TRO for good cause until it could resolve Plaintiffs’ forthcoming \npreliminary injunction motion.  Id.  \nE.  Preliminary Injunction Phase \nOn February 11, Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction.  ECF No. 40.  \nDefendants filed their opposition on February 15, ECF No. 47, and Plaintiffs filed their reply on \nFebruary 18, ECF No. 49.6    \nSome of Plaintiffs’ members submitted new declarations explaining that they have been \nable to access their previously allocated federal funds since the court’s entry of the TRO.  See ECF \nNos. 40-1 ¶ 3; 40-2 ¶ 6; 40-3 ¶ 4.  Those declarants still maintain, however, that any additional \npause in funding will have catastrophic or fatal consequences for their organizations.  See ECF \nNos. 40-1 ¶¶ 4-5; 40-2 ¶¶ 7-8; 40-3 ¶ 5. \n \n6 In the interim, on February 14, the American Center for Law and Justice filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of Defendants.  ECF No. 46. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 8 of 39\nOn the morning of February 20, the court held a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  Feb. 20, 2025 Minute Entry.   \nF.  Parallel Litigation in the District of Rhode Island \nOn the same day Plaintiffs filed this suit, and several hours before memorandum M-25-13’s \npause was to go into effect, twenty-two states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island and sought a TRO to halt implementation of the \nmemorandum.  See Compl., New York v. Trump, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 28, 2025), ECF No. 1.   \nThe district court held a hearing on January 29 at 3:00 p.m., after OMB had “rescinded” \nmemorandum M-25-13.  The court granted the States’ request and issued a TRO on January 31, 2025.  \nTRO, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025), ECF No. 50.  The restraining order \nprohibited the defendants (President Trump, OMB, and eleven federal agencies) from “paus[ing], \nfreez[ing], imped[ing], block[ing], cancel[ing], or terminat[ing] [their] compliance with awards \nand obligations to provide federal financial assistance to the [plaintiff] States.”  Id. at 11.  The order \nalso prohibited the defendants “from reissuing, adopting, implementing, or otherwise giving effect \nto the [OMB memorandum M-25-13] under any other name or title, . . . such as the continued \nimplementation identified by the White House Press Secretary’s statement of January 29, 2025.”  \nId. at 12.  Finally, the court directed the States to file their forthcoming motion for a preliminary \ninjunction expeditiously.  Id. at 11.   \nOn the morning of February 3, the defendants filed a notice of compliance with the District \nof Rhode Island’s TRO.  Notice of Compliance with Court’s TRO, New York, No. 25-CV-39 \n(D.R.I. Feb. 3, 2025), ECF No. 51.  In it, the defendants explained that they had provided written \nnotice to all defendant agencies on January 31 to inform them of the TRO and instruct them to \ncomply with its restrictions.  Id. ¶ 1.  The defendants also notified the court that they believed \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 9 of 39\ncertain terms of the TRO “constitute[d] significant intrusions on the Executive Branch’s lawful \nauthorities and the separation of powers.”  Id. ¶ 2. \nThe court subsequently set a briefing schedule on the States’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  Text Order, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 3, 2025).  On February 6, the court \nheld a status conference and extended the duration of its TRO until it could rule on the preliminary \ninjunction motion.  Text Order, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 6, 2025).  The next day, the \nStates filed an emergency motion to enforce the TRO, citing evidence that they “continue[d] to be \ndenied access to federal funds.”  Mot. for Enforcement of the TRO, New York, No. 25-CV-39 \n(D.R.I. Feb. 7, 2025), ECF No. 66.  The defendants opposed, arguing that their actions “d[id] not \nrun afoul of the Court’s injunction, or at least not a ‘clear and unambiguous command’ in the Court’s \ninjunction.”  Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce TRO, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 9, 2025), \nECF No. 70.  On February 10, the court granted the States’ motion and ordered the defendants to \n“immediately restore frozen funding,” “end any federal funding pause,” and “take every step \nnecessary to effectuate the TRO” during its pendency.  Order, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. \nFeb. 10, 2025), ECF No. 96.   \nEven  though  the  court  had  not  ruled  on  the  still-pending  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction, the defendants appealed later that day.  Notice of Appeal, New York, No. 25-CV-39 \n(D.R.I. Feb. 10, 2025), ECF No. 98.  They sought (1) review of the district court’s TRO order and \nenforcement orders, and (2) an administrative stay of the district court’s rulings pending the appeal.  \nEmergency Mot. for Immediate Administrative Stay, New York v. Trump, No. 23-1138 (1st Cir. \nFeb. 10, 2025).  The First Circuit assumed that it had jurisdiction over the appeal and unanimously \ndenied the request for an administrative stay without prejudice.  Order, New York, No. 23-1138 \n(1st Cir. Feb. 11, 2025).  It expressed uncertainty as to whether such an administrative stay could \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 10 of 39\nissue and noted that “the defendants d[id] not cite any authority in support of their administrative \nstay request or identify any harm related to a specific funding action or actions that they w[ould] \nface without their requested administrative stay.”  Id.  The appellate court did not address the \nmerits of the appeal.  Id.  The defendants then moved to voluntarily dismiss their appeal, Mot. to \nVoluntarily Dismiss Appeal, New York, No. 23-1138 (1st Cir. Feb. 13, 2025), which the court \ngranted on February 13.  Judgment, New York, No. 23-1138 (1st Cir. Feb. 13, 2025).   \nOn February 21, the District of Rhode Island held a preliminary injunction hearing.  The \ncourt took the States’ motion under advisement but “reiterate[d] that the previously entered TRO \n[remained] in full force and effect.”  Minute Entry, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 21, 2025).  \nLitigation remains ongoing. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Jurisdiction \nThe factual situation has shifted somewhat since the court entered its TRO, and Defendants \nagain press their jurisdictional arguments.  While the initial funding freeze has begun to thaw, the \ncourt concludes that it still retains jurisdiction. \n1.  Standing \nAs an initial matter, there is no question that Plaintiffs had standing when they initially \nbrought their complaint.  ECF No. 30, at 6-13; see Garcia v. U.S. Citizenship & Immgr. Servs., 168 \nF. Supp. 3d 50, 65 (D.D.C. 2016) (explaining that standing “is concerned with the presence of injury, \ncausation, and redressability at the time a complaint is filed”).  As the court explained in its TRO \nopinion, Plaintiffs had satisfied each of the three standing requirements: (1) a concrete and \nparticularized injury in fact; (2) a causal connection linking the injury and the challenged conduct; \nand (3) a likelihood that a favorable court decision will redress the injury.  ECF No. 30, at 6-7 \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 11 of 39\n(quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)).  While that alone is sufficient \nto confer standing, the court pauses to note that standing persists. \na.  Injury in fact \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that “even a temporary pause in funding to their members . . . \nwould destroy their ability to provide [critical] services.”  ECF No. 30, at 7; see ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 33-34, \n36-40.  Many, if not all, of Plaintiffs’ members “need weekly injections of federal funds in order \nto continue operating.”  ECF No. 30, at 8; see, e.g., ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 20-21.  Some have employees \nwho “live paycheck to paycheck, meaning that a single missed payment could prevent them from \nbuying groceries or paying rent.”  ECF No. 30, at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ECF \nNo. 24-4 ¶ 7.  Others had begun to feel the effects of the freeze even before it was supposed to go \ninto effect: one tribal organization was forced to preemptively lay off two employees on January 28.  \nECF No. 30, at 9; see ECF No. 24-5 ¶ 13.  Plaintiffs also demonstrated constitutional injury because \n“Defendants [allegedly] singled out their funding programs (in other words, their economic \nlifelines) based on their exercise of speech and association.”  ECF No. 30, at 8.   \nDefendants now try to frame the issue as one of Plaintiffs’ “standing to seek prospective \nrelief.”  ECF No. 47, at 11.  The court reminds Defendants that the injunctive relief currently in \nplace was issued to temporarily stave off imminent, irreparable harm.  Facts have certainly evolved \nsince then, see infra Part II.A.2, but Defendants cannot pretend that the nationwide chaos and \nparalysis from two weeks ago is some distant memory with no bearing on this case.  The relief \nPlaintiffs now seek is a more durable version of the relief they sought then, when their members \nwere on the brink of extinction.  In sum, Plaintiffs have marshalled significant evidence indicating \nthat the funding freeze would be economically catastrophic—and in some circumstances, fatal—\nto their members.  That is sufficient to show an injury-in-fact.   \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 12 of 39\nb.  Causation \nThe court previously rejected Defendants’ attempts to break the causal chain between the \nfunding freeze and the OMB Pause Memorandum.  ECF No. 30, at 9-12.  Plaintiffs convincingly \ndemonstrated that the memorandum—not some other cause—triggered the shutting down of federal \nfunding portals and the suspension of assistance payments.  Id.  While Defendants have tried to \nattribute the pauses to individual agency discretion, those pauses did not occur until after the \nmemorandum was issued. \nIn opposing the TRO, Defendants cited two cases, ECF No. 21-1, at 10-11, but the court \nwas not persuaded then, and it remains unpersuaded.  The first featured an executive order that \n“d[id] not require any action from federal agencies.”  Louisiana ex rel. Landry v. Biden, 64 F.4th \n674, 681 (5th Cir. 2023).  Instead, the order allowed agencies to individually determine whether \nthe guidance applied to their activities.  Id.  For that reason, causation in Louisiana “hinge[d] on \nthe independent choices of [a] regulated third party” and was not traceable to the defendant.  Center \nfor Law & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Nat’l Wrestling \nCoaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d 930, 938 (D.C. Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds \nby Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d 717 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc)).  In contrast, the OMB Pause \nMemorandum was a clear command.  It emphatically stated that all federal agencies “must \ntemporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial \nassistance.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.  That was a directive, not a suggestion.  Just two \nparagraphs later, it reiterated that agencies “must pause . . . disbursement of Federal funds under \nall open awards.”  Id.  And in the penultimate paragraph, it stated that “OMB may grant exceptions \nallowing Federal agencies to issue new awards or take other actions on a case-by-case basis.”  Id. \n(emphasis added).  On its face, the memorandum does not read like a guidance that leaves funding \ndecisions solely in the hands of independent, third-party agencies.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 13 of 39\nThe second case, on which Defendants no longer rely, was also inapposite.  In Jacobson v. \nFlorida Secretary of State, 974 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 2020), the plaintiffs sought to change the way \nelections officials were listing gubernatorial candidates, but they had sued a government actor with \nno actual control over those officials.  Id. at 1253.  The elections officials were answerable only to \nvoters, not the defendant.  Id.  Here, however, Defendants try to build their case on the exact opposite \npremise: that OMB does exercise control over federal financial policies.  See ECF No. 21-1, at \n16-20.  Both Louisiana and Jacobson are therefore inapplicable.   \nFurther undermining Defendants’ position, federal agencies clearly behaved as if the \nmemorandum caused the freeze.  In the immediate aftermath of the court’s administrative stay on \nJanuary 28, the Environmental Protection Agency continued to pause funding disbursements \nexplicitly based on the memorandum.  See ECF No. 24-1, at 7 (explaining that the agency was still \n“working  diligently  to  implement  [OMB]’s  memorandum”  and  was  therefore  “temporarily \npausing all activities related to the obligation or disbursement of EPA Federal financial assistance” \nand working closely “with OMB” to do so). \nUndeterred, Defendants vigorously challenge causation again at the preliminary-injunction \nstage.  They start by rehashing the independent-agency theory, claiming that the memorandum \n“did not itself temporarily pause any federal financial assistance.”  ECF No. 47, at 13.  For that to \nbe true, Defendants would have the court believe that countless federal agencies, none of which \nhad acted to cut off financial assistance before January 28, suddenly began exercising their own \ndiscretion  to  suspend  funding  across  the  board  at  the  exact  same  time.    That  would  be  a \nremarkable—and unfathomable—coincidence.  That this uniform freeze occurred just hours after \nthe memorandum’s issuance would be quite the happenstance, too.  Indeed, the record belies \nDefendants’ assertions.  It reflects that after OMB issued its memorandum on January 27, agencies \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 14 of 39\nimmediately began freezing funds, and after this court entered its TRO, some of those funds were \nreleased.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 40-3 ¶ 4 (organization able to draw down funds on February 4, one \nday after entry of the TRO); 40-1 ¶ 3 (organization able to draw down funds on February 5, two \ndays after entry of the TRO); 40-2 ¶ 6 (organization received funds on February 6, three days after \nentry of the TRO). \nDefendants try to downplay the fact that the freeze began to thaw after the court entered its \nTRO.  They claim that this “could equally be because such funds were not intended to be paused \nunder the OMB Memo and OMB Guidance, or because of a broader court order entered by the \ndistrict court in Rhode Island.”  ECF No. 47, at 13.  But this argument requires the exact same \ncoincidental assumptions as above, just in reverse.  And it contradicts the record, which indicates \nthat agencies explicitly relied on the memorandum when responding to funding inquiries.  See ECF \nNo. 24-1, at 7.  Adopting Defendants’ view would require reading the memorandum differently \nthan how it was written.  Its directive was broad and mandatory, and that is exactly how the \nagencies interpreted it.  See infra Part II.A.2.a. \nDefendants also argue that the memorandum “d[id] not determine which funds or grants \nshould be paused” and instead “require[d] that agencies make that determination, consistent with \ntheir own authorities.”  ECF No. 47, at 13.  In a manner of speaking, Defendants are right that the \nmemorandum did not identify specific funds to be paused.  Instead, it simply paused them all.  \nOMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.  Defendants cannot show that this directive left any room for \nagency discretion, especially on the nearly nonexistent timetable it provided.  Agencies were not \ngiven an option on whether to continue honoring their payment obligations; they simply had to \nstop.  And even if the agencies thought they had discretion to act, they were given roughly half a \nday to evaluate up to $3 trillion in grants, loans, and other programs.  That is not discretion.   \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 15 of 39\nWhen Plaintiffs filed suit, they alleged that Defendants had illegally ordered all federal \nagencies to suspend payments on open awards.  Plaintiffs provided evidence that those agencies \nonly started freezing funds after the memorandum was issued and—in some cases—expressly relied \non the memorandum to do so.  Within days of this court’s TRO (and Defendants’ written notice to \nall federal agencies), payments began to resume.  Defendants ask the court to overlook the simplest, \nmost logical explanation for that sequence of events.  The court declines to do so.   \nc.  Redressability \nRedressability is closely related to causation, and Plaintiffs have satisfied it.  Defendants \nclaim that “[Plaintiffs’] funding is not administered by OMB” and that an injunction against it \n“would not give [them] legally enforceable protection from the allegedly imminent harm.”  ECF \nNo. 47, at 14 (quoting Haalend v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023)).   \nBut Plaintiffs seek an injunction barring Defendants from directing agencies to freeze \nfederal funding nationwide in a blanket fashion.  Prelim. Inj. Hr’g, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, \nNo. 25-CV-239 (Feb. 20, 2025).  As the court previously explained, a ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor \nwould force agencies “to behave as if the memorandum were never issued.”  ECF No. 30, at 13.  \nAny pauses premised on the memorandum would cease, thus granting Plaintiffs significant relief.  \nWhether individual agencies later exercise their individual discretion to stop funding on another \nbasis does not defeat redressability as it pertains to the OMB Pause Memorandum. \n2.  Mootness \nMootness, sometimes defined as “standing set in a time frame,” asks whether a case continues \nto present a live controversy as it progresses.  U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 \n(1980) (quoting Henry P. Monaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: The Who and When, 82 Yale L.J. \n1363, 1384 (1973)).  As the court explained in its earlier opinion, despite the purported “recission” \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 16 of 39\nof the OMB Pause Memorandum, the case was not moot at the time the court entered its TRO.  \nECF No. 30, at 13-19.  While Defendants continue to argue mootness in light of recent factual \ndevelopments, the court’s previous analysis still applies today.   \na.  Rescission of the memorandum \nDefendants begin by again relying on the rescission of the OMB Pause Memorandum, \nwhich occurred on January 29.  ECF No. 47, at 8.  That “rescission,” however, had already taken \nplace when Defendants last made this same argument.  The court rejected the claim then, and it \nrejects the claim now.   \nFirst, the doctrine of voluntary cessation still applies.  A party’s decision to stop “a challenged \npractice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine [its] legality.”  Friends of the \nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting City of Mesquite \nv. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  This doctrine exists to protect plaintiffs and \nprevent a defendant from “return[ing] to [its] old ways” as soon as a case gets dismissed.  Id. \n(quoting City of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289).  To overcome it, a defendant must meet a heavy \nburden: it must show that it is “absolutely clear [that] the allegedly wrongful behavior [cannot] \nreasonably be expected to recur.”  Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm’n, 92 F.4th 1124, \n1128 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (emphasis added) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 189).   \nRescinding the OMB Pause Memorandum did not moot the case because Defendants could \nnot—and still cannot—show that they will not “resume the challenged activity.”  Id.  As the court \npreviously observed, the White House Press Secretary appeared to completely contradict the act \nof rescission by expressly stating that it was “NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze.”  \nKaroline Leavitt, X (formerly Twitter) (Jan. 29, 2025), https://perma.cc/99C4-5V6G.  By any \nreading of the Press Secretary’s remarks, the memorandum’s retraction was an empty gesture.  At \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 17 of 39\nbest, it was meaningless.  At worst, it was a brazen attempt to deprive the court of jurisdiction \nwithout actually altering course.  See Pub. Citizen, Inc., 92 F.4th at 1128 (explaining that the \nvoluntary-cessation doctrine applies with greater force when a party is suspected of “manipulating \nthe judicial process through the false pretense of singlehandedly ending a dispute” (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, \n920 F.3d 1, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam))).  Because Plaintiffs’ members were still being \nfrozen out of their funding in the wake of the purported “rescission,” see ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶ 12; 24-5 \n¶ 24;  24-11  ¶ 19,  “it  appears  that  OMB  sought  to  overcome  a  judicially  imposed  obstacle \nwithout . . . ceasing the challenged conduct.”  ECF No. 30, at 16.7 \nDefendants and Amicus now say that factual developments have made the voluntary-\ncessation doctrine inapplicable.  ECF No. 47, at 9-10.  Specifically, they say that “there is no reason \nto think OMB [will] reissue the challenged Memo” because the President’s executive orders—\nwhich Plaintiffs do not challenge—remain in place.  Id. at 10; see ECF No. 48, at 4 (Amicus \n \n7 Amicus American Center for Law and Justice echoes Defendants’ mootness argument, claiming \nthat “none of [Plaintiffs’] desired terms of the Prayer for Relief can be implemented [because] there \nis no OMB Memo that can be enjoined, restrained, or vacated.”  ECF No. 48, at 3.  The court has \nalready rejected this argument.  To the extent that Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief is limited only to the \nmemorandum, they have shown that the rescission had no real effect on Defendants’ actions.  For \ndays after the memorandum purportedly ceased to exist, agencies continued to withhold funds \npursuant to its authority.  See ECF No. 24-1, at 7.  If Amicus were correct, a government agency \ncould order illegal activity, retract that order in name only while continuing to implement its \nsubstance, and escape legal liability.  The court refuses to ratify such behavior.  Amicus goes on \nto argue that “Plaintiffs cannot use a Complaint directed against the OMB Memo as a basis for \nobtaining relief against all pauses of whatever basis,” ECF No. 48, at 5, but this misconstrues the \nrequested injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs made clear at the preliminary injunction hearing that they \nonly seek to prevent Defendants from ordering or implementing unilateral, blanket pauses across \nthe entire federal funding apparatus.  See Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g, at 55:15-18, Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (Feb. 20, 2025) (proposing an order that would enjoin a “unilateral[] . . . \nfreeze on the payment of open awards on a non-individualized basis”).  In other words, Plaintiffs \nwish to use a complaint directed against an agency-ordered blanket freeze to obtain relief against \nthat precise action.   \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 18 of 39\narguing that the “executive orders related to federal funding” independently “order[ed] federal \nagencies to engage in certain specified pauses”).  In other words, the memorandum would have no \nadded benefit.  But this argument ignores the fact that the effects of the OMB Pause Memorandum \nand the President’s executive orders were not coextensive.  At the TRO hearing, Defendants could \nnot explain all the frozen funding by relying on the executive orders alone.  See ECF No. 30, at 18 \n(“Plaintiffs have provided evidence that the scope of frozen funds appears to extend far beyond \nthe reach of the executive orders[.]”), 19 (“At oral argument, when asked about another declarant \nwho was receiving a grant from the National Science Foundation, Defendants could not give a \nclear answer as to why that recipient would be denied funds pursuant to the executive orders.” \n(citation omitted)).   Defendants  insist  that this overreach may have been because agencies \noverzealously implemented the freeze.  But that is a problem of Defendants’ own creation.  Their \nmemo was written, interpreted, and executed as a blanket pause.  See, e.g., Tr. of TRO Hr’g, at \n16:1-5, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (“[T]he way that the \nOMB order has been implemented in many cases . . . is [not by] pausing individual grants but by \nfreezing the platforms, the online portals[.]”).  Defendants cannot shift the blame onto federal \nagencies because those agencies followed Defendants’ own orders.   \nAttempting to put the agencies’ real-world interpretations aside, Defendants assert that the \nmemorandum’s language was clearly limited only to activities covered by the seven executive orders \nreferenced in the memorandum.  See Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g, at 26:25-29:17, Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025).  The court is unconvinced for several reasons. \nThe memorandum’s primary directive (“must temporarily pause”) targeted “all activities related \nto [the] obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency \nactivities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 19 of 39\nassistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the \ngreen new deal.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.  OMB’s decision to separate the first and second \nclauses indicated that they were to be treated as distinct categories for the pause.  If both clauses \nwere meant to be limited to the executive orders, it is not clear why OMB would distinguish “all \nactivities related to obligation or disbursement” from “other relevant agency activities.”  Id.  \nConceivably, OMB would have simply instructed agencies to pause all funding activities related \nto the executive orders and leave it at that.   \nFurthermore, the whole purpose of the pause was to give agencies time “to identify \nprograms, projects, and activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive \norders.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The pause was to apply “[i]n the interim”—in other words, while \nthat identification took place.  It would make little sense for agencies to only pause activities \nassociated with the executive orders while evaluating what activities are even associated with the \nexecutive orders in the first place.  The narrower reading that Defendants endorse would require \nagencies to already know what activities “may be implicated” by the executive orders.  For the \nmemorandum’s order of operations to be logical, then, the court would need to read it the way \nPlaintiffs do: OMB told agencies to assess funding for consistency with the President’s executive \norders and, “[i]n the interim,” “temporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or \ndisbursement of Federal financial assistance” while that assessment was underway.  Id.  \nAdditionally, if the memorandum’s language were obviously limited to the executive \norders, the court does not understand why OMB included a footnote carving out Social Security \nand Medicare, see id. at 1 n.2, or subsequently issued an entirely new document clarifying the \noriginal directive, ECF No. 11-1.  None of the executive orders addresses Social Security or \nMedicare at all.  If it were apparent that the pause did not extend beyond the executive orders, the \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 20 of 39\nfootnote is entirely unnecessary.  And as for the subsequent guidance, it does not make sense for \nDefendants to claim that an initial instruction is unambiguous but then feel a need to clarify it only \nhours later. \nIn sum, the doctrine of voluntary cessation still applies.  Defendants have not made it \n“absolutely clear” that they will refrain from resuming the challenged activity given their post-\ncomplaint actions and overly restrictive reading of the memorandum’s language.  Pub. Citizen, \nInc., 92 F.4th at 1128. \nb.  Resumption of funding \nSecond, Defendants try to argue that the gradual thawing of the freeze indicates mootness.  \nECF No. 47, at 9-11.  The court disagrees.  It is true that some of Plaintiffs’ members are now \nreceiving federal funds again, but that does not render their case, or their request for injunctive \nrelief, moot.   \nAt the preliminary injunction stage, Defendants cannot simply “claim that the need for an \ninjunction is now moot because [they have] ‘ceased [their] wrongful conduct.’”  Costa v. Bazron, \n464 F. Supp. 3d 132, 141 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Taylor v. Resol. Tr. Corp., 56 F.3d 1497, (D.C. \nCir. 1995)).  This rings especially true when the cessation “follow[s] the entry of a TRO.”  Id.  The \n“court’s power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct” because \nthe “purpose . . . is to prevent future violations.”  Dep’t of Just. v. Daniel Chapter One, 89 F. Supp. \n3d 132, 143 (D.D.C. 2015) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 \nU.S. 629, 633 (1953)).   \nDefendants instructed agencies to disregard the directives of the memorandum, as they \nwere required to do so by two different courts’ orders.  See ECF No. 30, at 29 (directing Defendants \nto issue written notice to all agencies); ECF No. 39-1 (Defendants’ written notice); TRO, New \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 21 of 39\nYork, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025), ECF No. 50.  But Defendants cannot now rely on this \ncourt-ordered compliance to argue that a court order is unnecessary.  As Plaintiffs point out, and \nas other judges of this court have recognized, adopting Defendants’ position would mean that no \nTRO could ever become a preliminary injunction.  See Costa, 464 F. Supp. 3d at 142 (“If \ncompliance with the terms of a TRO were sufficient to defeat entry of a preliminary injunction, \nfew—if any—cases would make it past the TRO stage.”).  \nDefendants  blithely  suggest  that  if  they  were  to  revive  or  reissue  the  OMB  Pause \nMemorandum at some future point in time, Plaintiffs could simply “file another motion for \npreliminary relief.”  ECF No. 47, at 11.  This proposal completely disregards the mountain of \nevidence Plaintiffs presented showing that even the threat of a funding freeze was enough to send \ncountless organizations into complete disarray.  Hours before the original pause was scheduled to \nstart, organizations were already laying off staff or shuttering programs.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 24-5 \n¶ 13; 24-7 ¶¶ 20-21.  In some cases, this was anticipatory; in others, it was because organizations \nwere already being frozen out of funding portals.  See ECF Nos. 24-8 ¶¶ 8-9; 24-6 ¶ 15; 24-7 ¶ 13; \n24-8 ¶ 9.  Defendants’ assumption that Plaintiffs can easily rush back before the court for \ninjunctive relief before catastrophe ensues is, quite simply, divorced from reality and the record.  \nIndeed, while turning off funding streams appears to have been alarmingly easy, turning them back \non has proven much more difficult.  See ECF No. 40-2 ¶ 6 (explaining that it took three days to \nreceive funding after entry of the TRO); Prelim. Inj. Hr’g, at 3:9-10, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, \nNo. 25-CV-239 (Feb. 20, 2025) (“Unfreezing of funds in response to that order has not always \nbeen smooth; in some cases, we think maybe imperfect and incomplete.”).   \nAdditionally, other intervening developments since the court issued its TRO seem to \nincrease the urgency of injunctive relief.  On February 10, the judge in the District of Rhode Island \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 22 of 39\ncase was forced to issue an order enforcing its TRO after the States “presented evidence . . . that \nthe Defendants in some cases have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to \nresume disbursement of appropriated federal funds.”  Order, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. \nFeb. 10, 2025), ECF No. 96.  The court did not mince words, concluding that “[t]hese pauses in \nfunding violate the plain text of the TRO.”  Id.  Defendants cannot convincingly tell this court that \nthere is no longer a need for injunctive relief after they were found to be in violation of another \ncourt’s order.   \nFor all these reasons, the court remains unpersuaded by Defendants’ mootness arguments.  \nTo be sure, the government is normally entitled to a presumption of good faith on voluntary \ncessation.  Pub. Citizen, Inc., 92 F.4th at 1128-29 (quoting Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, \n705 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en banc)).  But the court will not confer that presumption when the government \nsays one thing while expressly doing another.  Karoline Leavitt, X (formerly Twitter) (Jan. 29, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/99C4-5V6G.  And it will not reward parties who change appearances without \nchanging conduct.   \n3.  Ripeness \nAt the preliminary injunction stage, Defendants raise a new jurisdictional argument based \non ripeness.  They claim that Plaintiffs’ claims are currently “too amorphous” for judicial review, \nand that the court should delay adjudication until further factual developments.  ECF No. 47, at \n14.8 \n \n8 Defendants acknowledge, however, that Plaintiffs’ statutory claim—whether OMB has the power \nand authority to order “a government-wide halt on trillions of dollars in grants, loans, and other \nforms of financial assistance”—does not raise ripeness concerns.  ECF No. 47, at 20 n.2. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 23 of 39\nUnder the ripeness doctrine, courts conduct a two-pronged inquiry that evaluates (1) “the \nfitness of the issues for judicial decision,” and (2) “the hardship to the parties of withholding court \nconsideration.”  Andrade v. Lauer, 729 F.2d 1475, 1480 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (quoting Abbott Lab’ys \nv. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 \nU.S. 99 (1977)).  But when “a threatened injury is sufficiently ‘imminent’ to establish standing, the \nconstitutional requirements of the ripeness doctrine will necessarily be satisfied.”  Nat’l Treasury \nEmps. Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1428 (D.C. Cir. 1996).   \nPlaintiffs have already established concrete, particularized, and non-speculative injuries—\ninjuries that had devastating effects, persisted after the OMB Pause Memorandum was stayed, and \nloom over Plaintiffs to this day.  In arguing to the contrary, Defendants ask the court to ignore the \nfact that agencies continued implementing OMB’s freeze or that the District of Rhode Island had \nto enforce its TRO mere days after it was entered.  In the instant litigation, the only reason that \nharm stopped was because of injunctive relief issued by this court—relief that Defendants insist is \nunnecessary.  Defendants’ ripeness arguments, like their mootness arguments, wholly disregard \nthe factual circumstances of this case and its context.   \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \nWhile they differ in duration, temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions are \nsubject to the same substantive legal standards.  See, e.g., Singh v. Carter, 168 F. Supp. 3d 216, \n223 (D.D.C. 2016).  Courts may either grant a preliminary injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 65(c) or, in APA cases, may “issue all necessary and appropriate process to . . . \npreserve  status  or  rights  pending  conclusion  of  the  review  proceedings”  when  doing  so  is \n“necessary to prevent irreparable injury.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  Both provisions provide a mechanism \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 24 of 39\nfor issuing injunctive relief and operate under the same four-factor test.  District of Columbia v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 2020).   \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, “the moving party must show (1) a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted, \n(3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that the public \ninterest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nThese four considerations are factors, not elements.  “A district court must ‘balance the \nstrengths of the requesting party’s arguments in each of the four required areas.’”  Id. (quoting \nCityFed Fin. Corp. v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  When a \ngovernment entity is a party to the case, the third and fourth factors merge.  Pursuing Am.’s \nGreatness v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nPrior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008), courts in this Circuit tended to employ a “sliding scale” method in which \n“a strong showing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.”  Sherley v. \nSebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  While the D.C. Circuit has considered abandoning \nthe sliding-scale method for one that treats the substantial likelihood prong as “an independent, \nfree-standing requirement,” id. at 393, it has yet to decide one way or the other, see Changji Esquel \nTextile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  At the very least, however, the plaintiff \nmust present a “serious legal question on the merits.”  Raimondo, 40 F.4th at 726 (quoting Sherley, \n644 F.3d at 398).  Given the ambiguity with respect to the sliding-scale approach, the court will \nconsider all factors and delve into their relative weight only if it would affect the outcome.  See \nCosta, 456 F. Supp. 3d at 133.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 25 of 39\n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nOn the merits, Defendants largely repeat the same arguments they made at the TRO stage.  \nSee ECF No. 47, at 14-16 (final agency action), 25-31 (arbitrary and capricious), 31-34 (statutory \nauthority), 34-36 (First Amendment).  The court begins by addressing OMB’s guidance document, \nwhich the parties discussed at length in their preliminary injunction briefing and at oral argument.  \nSee ECF No. 47, at 20-25; ECF No. 49, at 4-6; Prelim. Inj. Hr’g, at 6:19-9:14, 29:21-32:24, Nat’l \nCouncil of Nonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025).  It then turns to final agency action, \nfollowed by the substantive merits of Plaintiffs’ three claims. \na.  The role of the OMB Guidance \nDefendants spill considerable ink about OMB’s issuance of a guidance document, ECF \nNo. 11-1 (“OMB Guidance Document”), which supposedly limited the scope of the OMB Pause \nMemorandum, see ECF No. 47, at 20-25.  They assert that the original memorandum, when read in \ntandem with the OMB Guidance Document, stops short of unlawful agency action.  Id. at 21 (noting \nthe OMB Guidance Document’s statement that “the pause does not apply across-the-board” and \n“is expressly limited to programs, projects, and activities implicated by the President’s Executive \nOrders”).  This argument sounds persuasive in theory but clashes with how Defendants’ directives \nwere actually written and implemented.   \nAs an initial matter, the language of the OMB Guidance Document appears to contradict \nthat of the original memorandum.  The guidance document sought to carve out numerous programs \nand portray the initial command as much more limited, but the original memorandum mandated (in \nbold typeface, no less) that all federal agencies “must temporarily pause all activities related to \n[the] obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.”  OMB Pause Memorandum.  \nIt also required agencies to stop the “disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”  Id. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 26 of 39\n(emphasis added).  As the court explained previously, supra Part II.A.2.a, this language conveyed \na clear directive to implement a blanket pause of federal financial assistance.  That flatly contravenes \nthe OMB Guidance Document’s pronouncement that the pause “d[id] not apply across-the-board.”  \nOMB Guidance Document, at 1.   \nFurthermore, regardless of how Defendants would have liked their guidance to apply, that \nis a far cry from how it was administered in practice.  As far as the parties and this court are aware, \nthe guidance was issued at some point on January 28 (the same day the funding freeze was to take \neffect).  Plaintiffs only received a copy of the guidance around 1:30 p.m., see ECF No. 11, at 2, \nand even Defendants did not know exactly when it was originally issued or distributed to federal \nagencies, Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g, at 25:5-9, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (Feb. 20, \n2025).  Under the most generous viewing of the case’s chronology, agencies had maybe four hours \n(but probably fewer) to actualize the OMB Guidance Document.  Clearly, that was not enough \ntime.9  Agencies still implemented the original memorandum as written.  For example, despite the \nguidance’s attempt to carve out “program[s] that provide[] direct benefits to individuals,” OMB \nGuidance Document, at 1, financial assistance for such programs was still suspended, see ECF \nNos. 24-5 ¶¶ 14-16; 27-1 ¶¶ 4-5.  The guidance also exempted “[f]unds for small businesses” and \n“Head Start” payments, OMB Guidance Document, at 2, but those fell victim to the freeze, too, \nsee ECF Nos. 24-3, at 74; 24-6.  Defendants cannot rely on the OMB Guidance Document as a \nsaving grace when it had virtually no effect on the ground.   \n \n9 Indeed, some agencies froze funding portals and resources even before the OMB Guidance \nDocument was issued.  Those agencies were necessarily operating pursuant to the original OMB \nPause Memorandum, not the subsequent guidance.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶ 8 (unable to access \nfunding portal during the day on January 28, before Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed around noon); \n24-7 ¶ 13 (same); 24-8 ¶ 9 (unable to access fund portal as early as January 27).   \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 27 of 39\nThis theme—that Plaintiffs are trying to enjoin a far-reaching version of the OMB Pause \nMemorandum that never existed—pervades all of Defendants’ briefing and argument.  See ECF \nNo. 47, at 10 (mootness), 13 (causation), 20-25 (role of the OMB Guidance Document); 27 (arbitrary \nand capricious).  But Defendants cannot take a memorandum that was drafted broadly, interpreted \nexpansively, and implemented categorically and fault Plaintiffs for “overreading” that directive.   \nb.  Final agency action \nDefendants, now joined by Amicus, again dispute whether the OMB Pause Memorandum \nwas final agency action.  Like before, the court is unpersuaded.   \nFinality is a prerequisite to the judicial review of an APA claim.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nAgency actions, as a general matter, must be “circumscribed [and] discrete.”  Norton v. S. Utah \nWilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004).  Final agency action, in particular, “must mark the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and determine “rights or obligations . . . \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (first quoting Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 \nU.S. 103, 113 (1948), then quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass’n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)).  The APA does not, for example, allow a court to review \nan agency’s “day-to-day operations.”  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871,  899 (1990).   \nEchoing points from their causation argument, Defendants claim that any instruction from \nOMB could not have been final because it was the individual agencies that carried out the funding \nfreeze.  To the extent this repeats the causation analysis, the court has already addressed it.  See \nsupra Part II.A.1.b.   \nDefendants  and  Amicus further accuse Plaintiffs of improperly advancing  a “‘broad \nprogrammatic attack’ on an agency’s operations” by targeting a policy “consisting [principally] \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 28 of 39\nof . . . many individual actions.”  ECF No. 48, at 5 (second alteration in original) (first quoting \nNorton, 542 U.S. at 64, then quoting Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 892-93); see ECF No. 47, \nat 15-16.  But Plaintiffs only challenge one specific act by OMB: ordering a nationwide pause on \nfederal financial assistance.  And, as explained, supra Part II.B.1.a, Defendants and Amicus cannot \nrely on a theoretical version or application of OMB’s directives.  The initial memorandum was \ndrafted and interpreted broadly in accordance with its text, and what little clarity the guidance \noffered—if any—came far too late.  As the court explained in its earlier opinion, the OMB Pause \nMemorandum  issued  a  mandatory  command  to  other  federal  agencies  that  produced  legal \nconsequences for Plaintiffs and others.  See ECF No. 30, at 21-23. \nc.  Arbitrary and capricious \nUnder the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  “The scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard \nis narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  To pass muster, \nthe agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] \nincluding a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Id. (quoting \nBurlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Agency action is generally \ndeemed unlawful if it “has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that \nruns counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to \na difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Id. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 29 of 39\nThe arbitrary-and-capricious review at this stage of the litigation remains largely unchanged \nfrom the court’s earlier opinion.  The touchstone of this inquiry is rationality, and Defendants’ \nactions flunk that test.  Defendants still cannot provide a reasonable explanation for why they \nneeded to freeze all federal financial assistance in less than a day to “safeguard valuable taxpayer \nresources.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 1.  Evaluating funding priorities can be done without \nneeding to starve citizens or deny critical health services.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶ 6; 24-11 \n¶¶ 6-7.  The potential $3 trillion in financial assistance implicated by the freeze is a “breathtakingly \nlarge sum of money to suspend practically overnight.”  ECF No. 30, at 24.  And “[r]ather than \ntaking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending, Defendants cut the fuel \nsupply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine—seemingly without any consideration for the \nconsequences of that decision.”  Id.  Doing so was not—and could never be—rational, especially \nwhen the decision was made without grappling with its catastrophic effects or the logistical \nnightmare of its implementation.10  See Bus. Roundtable v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 647 F.3d 1144, \n1148 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining that an agency’s failure to “apprise itself . . . of the economic \nconsequences” of potential action is “arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law” \n(quoting Chamber of Com. of the U.S. v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 412 F.3d 133, 144 (D.C. \n \n10 Both Defendants and Amicus argue that “[t]emporary funding pauses are not an unusual exercise \nof executive authority.”  ECF No. 48, at 6; see ECF No. 47, at 26-28, 30-31.  For support, they \nrely on President Biden’s pause of funding to the southern border wall, Proclamation No. 10,142, \nTermination  of  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the  Southern  Border  of  the  United  States  and \nRedirection of Funds Diverted to Border Wall Construction, 86 Fed. Reg. 7225 (Jan. 20, 2021), \nand President Obama’s thirty-day delay of Recovery Act funds, Mem. No. E9-6754, Ensuring \nResponsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, 74 Fed. Reg. 12531 (Mar. 20, 2009).  Without \npassing judgment on the merits of any hypothetical challenges to those executive decrees, the court \nis unpersuaded that targeted pauses of funding for specific projects through an executive order are \nat all comparable OMB’s nationwide suspension of all federal financial assistance.  Again, the \ncourt disagrees with Defendants’ and Amicus’s characterization of the pause in this case as \n“targeted” and “discrete” when the language of the memorandum applied to the “disbursement of \nall Federal funds under all open awards.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.   \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 30 of 39\nCir. 2005))).  Defendants essentially adopted a “freeze first, ask questions later” approach that \n“entirely failed to consider [multiple] important aspect[s] of the problem.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n, 463 U.S. at 43.11 \nDefendants also ignored significant reliance interests.  Plaintiffs—who only challenge the \npausing of already allocated funds—produced substantial evidence that numerous organizations \nneed consistent disbursements of funds to even operate.  Missing a single payment could require \nimmediate firings or the discontinuation of entire programs.  See ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶¶ 4, 6; 24-5 ¶ 13.  \nWhen an agency suddenly changes course, it must recognize “that longstanding policies may have \nengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. \nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nEncino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221-22 (2016)).  Defendants entirely failed to \ndo so.  \nIn the simplest terms, the freeze was ill-conceived from the beginning.  Defendants either \nwanted to pause up to $3 trillion in federal spending practically overnight, or they expected each \nfederal agency to review every single one of its grants, loans, and funds for compliance in less than \ntwenty-four hours.  The breadth of that command is almost unfathomable.  See ECF No. 30, at 17 \n(“[I]t is unclear whether twenty-four hours is sufficient time for an agency to independently review \na single grant, let alone hundreds of thousands of them.”).  Either way, Defendants’ actions were \n \n11 Defendants repeatedly reference the memorandum’s limitation that agencies only act “to the \nextent permissible under applicable law,” OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2, but this does not save \nthem.  First, the incantation of magic language cannot justify otherwise-illegal action.  Plaintiffs’ \nentire complaint alleges that Defendants’ instruction was unlawful to begin with.  Second, even \nassuming that this language applies does not change the arbitrary-and-capricious analysis.  Just \nbecause an agency can do something does not make it rational to do so.   \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 31 of 39\nirrational, imprudent, and precipitated a nationwide crisis.  Plaintiffs have therefore shown a \nlikelihood of success on their arbitrary and capricious claim. \nd.  Excess of statutory authority \nPlaintiffs’ second claim argues that Defendants dramatically overstepped the bounds of \ntheir legal authority in ordering a nationwide funding freeze.12  Agencies “are creatures of statute” \nand are therefore subject to the limits prescribed by Congress.  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t \nof Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (“OSHA”).  In other \nwords, they “‘literally ha[ve] no power to act’ except to the extent Congress [has] authorized.”  \nMarin Audubon Soc’y v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 121 F.4th 902, 912 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (first alteration \nin original) (quoting Fed. Election Comm’n v. Ted Cruz for Senate, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022)).  If \nan agency exceeds that power, the court must set aside its action under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(C).   \nOMB’s organic statute is 31 U.S.C. § 503.  Within it, Defendants primarily rely on \nsubsections (a)(2) and (a)(5), but neither appears to grant the expansive authority that OMB tried \nto exercise here.  Under subsection (a)(2), OMB may “[p]rovide overall direction and leadership \nto the executive branch on financial management matters by establishing financial management \npolicies and requirements.”  Id. § 503(a)(2).  But providing overall direction and establishing \nfinancial management policies do not clearly confer the power to halt all finances, full-stop, on a \nmoment’s notice.  Indeed, the structure and provisions of Section 503 strongly suggest that OMB \n \n12 As was the case at the TRO stage, a plaintiff who brings multiple claims only needs to show a \nlikelihood of success on one of them to obtain injunctive relief.  See Media Matters for Am. v. \nPaxton, 732 F. Supp. 3d 1, 27 (D.D.C.), appeal filed, No. 24-7059 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  In the interest \nof being thorough, the court will address each of Plaintiffs’ claims here.   \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 32 of 39\noccupies an oversight role.  Defendants have not pointed to specific authority that allows it to \nunilaterally pull the plug on nearly all federal monetary flows.   \nSubsection (a)(5) further indicates that OMB’s role is mainly supervisory, rather than directly \nactive.  That subsection permits OMB to “monitor the financial execution of the budget in relation \nto actual expenditures.”  Id. § 503(a)(5).  Such language falls well short of actively deciding \nwhether agencies “must temporarily pause” all federal financial assistance.  Defendants cannot \nconvincingly argue that “monitor” rises to that level of affirmative control.  See Monitor, The \nOxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (defining “monitor” as “to observe, supervise, or keep \nunder review”).   \nWhen an agency seeks to “exercise powers of vast economic and political significance,” \nthe “sheer scope of [an agency]’s claimed authority” can trigger heightened judicial scrutiny.  Ala. \nAss’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021) (per curiam) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)).  In \nsuch situations, the court “expect[s] Congress to speak clearly” when conferring such authority.  \nOSHA, 595 U.S. at 117 (quoting Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at 764).  The Supreme Court has \nreferred to this principle as the “major questions doctrine.”  Id. at 122 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \nBased on the cases in which the Supreme Court has invoked the doctrine, this case easily qualifies.  \nSee Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at 764 (applying the doctrine where the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention implemented a nationwide eviction moratorium affecting up to 17 million \ntenants); OSHA, 595 U.S. at 117-18 (applying the doctrine where OSHA required all federal \nemployees to obtain COVID-19 vaccinations).   \n“When an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to \nregulate ‘a significant  portion of the American economy,’” the court “typically greet[s] its \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 33 of 39\nannouncement with a measure of skepticism.”  Util. Air Regul. Auth. Grp., 573 U.S. at 324 (quoting \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 159 (2000)).  Here, Defendants \nattempted to freeze as much as $3 trillion dollars—the sum total of “all activities related to [the] \nobligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.  \nThat is “no everyday exercise of federal power.”  OSHA, 595 U.S. at 117 (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting In re MCP No. 165, Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 20 F.4th 264, 272 \n(6th Cir. 2021) (Sutton, C.J., dissenting)).   \nThe scope of power OMB seeks to claim is “breathtaking,” and its ramifications are \nmassive.  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at 764.  Because there is no clear statutory hook for this \nbroad assertion of power, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.   \ne.  First Amendment \nPlaintiffs’ third claim alleges that Defendants are “threaten[ing] [the] continued receipt of \nfederal  financial  assistance  based  explicitly  on  [the  recipients’]  exercise  of  their  core  First \nAmendment rights of speech and association.”  ECF No. 40, at 26.  Defendants counter that the \ngovernment  may  “selectively  fund  a  program  to  encourage  certain  activities”  without \nsimultaneously “funding an alternative program [that] deal[s] with the problem in another way.”  \nECF No. 47, at 34 (quoting Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991)).  Defendants are correct \nthat the government “is not required to subsidize First Amendment rights,” Leathers v. Medlock, \n499 U.S. 439, 450 (1991), or “assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas,” Ysursa \nv. Pocatello Educ. Ass’n, 555 U.S. 353, 358 (2009).  And refusing to pay for certain speech \ngenerally does not inflict a First Amendment harm.  See Rust, 500 U.S. at 193.   \nWhat is less clear, however, is whether the government may deliberately withhold funds \nthat have already been earmarked for certain recipients based exclusively on the recipient’s \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 34 of 39\nviewpoints.  Rust and similar decisions by the Supreme Court “are grounded in the notion that the \n‘Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid.’”  J.D. v. Azar, \n925 F.3d 1291, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Webster v. Reprod. Health Servs., 492 U.S. 490, \n507 (1989)).  But that calculus could change if individuals or organizations have already been \nawarded certain funds and grants—as is the case with Plaintiffs’ members here.  If Defendants \nwere  to  unfreeze  promised  funds  only  to  organizations  expressing  one  view,  but  not  to \norganizations expressing the opposite view, that could raise First Amendment concerns. \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has held that the government “may not deny a benefit to \na person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech[,] even if he \nhas no entitlement to that benefit.”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. \n205, 214 (2013) (“USAID”) (emphasis added) (quoting Rumsfeld v. F. for Acad. & Institutional \nRights, 547 U.S. 47, 59 (2006)).  It has also made clear that the government cannot “leverage \nfunding to regulate speech outside the contours of the [funding] program itself.”  Id. at 214-15 \n(emphasis added).  In other words, when the government exerts First Amendment pressures that \nhave nothing to do with the actual financial assistance program, that can be a constitutional \nviolation.  Plaintiffs rely on that principle here.  Defendants respond by arguing that the OMB \nPause Memorandum is solely framed around “focusing taxpayer dollars” and “[t]he use of federal \nresources,” rather than governing speech beyond the scope of federal financial assistance.  ECF \nNo. 47, at 34-35 (alteration in original) (citing OMB Pause Memorandum, at 1).   \nWhile the answer is not obvious at this early stage, Plaintiffs have shown some likelihood \nof success on their First Amendment claim.  The Supreme Court has remarked that the line between \nproper subsidization and improper coercion  “is hardly clear . . . because the definition of a \nparticular program can always be manipulated to subsume the challenged condition.”  USAID, 570 \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 35 of 39\nU.S. at 215.  That said, the government “cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition \nof its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.”  \nId. (quoting Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001)).  The OMB Pause \nMemorandum made several policy statements that are hostile to concepts like “Marxist equity,” \n“transgenderism,” and “woke gender ideology.”  OMB Memorandum, at 2.  It also instructed federal \nagencies to pause all disbursements that could be connected to these ill-defined categories.  Id.  \nThere is no indication that expressing viewpoints on these issues (or being associated with them \nat all) is in any way tied to the “contours of the [funding] program[s] [themselves].”  USAID, 570 \nU.S. at 214-15. \nThe government “may not ‘aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas’” or “manipulate[]” \na subsidy “to have a coercive effect.”  Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 \n(1998) (brackets omitted) (first quoting Regan v. Tax’n Without Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. \n540, 550 (1983), then quoting Ark. Writers’ Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 237 (1987) \n(Scalia, J., dissenting)).  By appearing to target specific recipients because they associate with certain \nideas, Defendants may be crossing a constitutional line.   \n2.  Irreparable Harm \nWhile irreparable injury is “a high standard,” England, 454 F.3d at 297, the court’s analysis \nof this factor remains unchanged from the TRO stage.  Defendants have not introduced arguments \nor evidence sufficient to undercut Plaintiffs’ strong showing of irreparable harm.   \nTo qualify for injunctive relief, the alleged injury “must be both certain and great,” “actual \nand not theoretical,” and “of such imminence that there is a ‘clear and present’ need for equitable \nrelief.”  Id. (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n(per curiam)).  It must also “be beyond remediation,” meaning that “[t]he possibility [of] adequate \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 36 of 39\ncompensatory or other corrective relief . . . at a later date . . . weighs heavily against a claim of \nirreparable harm.”  Id. at 297-98 (quoting Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674).   \nHere, Plaintiffs have produced significant evidence that a pause on federal funding will \n“threaten[] the very existence of [their members’] business.”  Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.  A \nfreeze will not simply inconvenience them, it will devastate them.  The court recounts its findings \nfrom before, which still hold true today: \nIf the freeze were to remain in effect [or recur], Plaintiffs’ members \nwill suffer “existential injuries” and some programs may “simply \ndisappear.”  ECF No. 5-1, at 12.  Their workers may be unable to \npay for housing or food.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 7 (“A lot of our staff live \npaycheck to paycheck, and if they can’t get paid, then they are \nunable to pay rent or buy groceries.”).  Some have already been \nforced to “shutter [their] programs” just to make payroll.  ECF \nNo. 24-7 ¶¶ 20-21.  And patients or customers that rely on their \nservices may be denied care when it is most needed.  ECF Nos. 24-4 \n¶ 16; 24-5 ¶ 21.  For some, these are harms for which “there can be \nno do over and no redress.”  Newby, 838 F.3d at 9 (quoting League \nof Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th \nCir. 2014)); see ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 7 (“[I]f my Health Center loses \nphysicians, dentist, or nurse practitioners, then it will be virtually \nimpossible to recruit replacements to a rural Health System that is \nsuddenly an unreliable source of income.”).   \nECF No. 30, at 27. \nWhile funds have resumed flowing to some recipients, that does not erase the imminence \nor irreparability of what another pause would entail.  As at least one declarant explained, the \nresumption of funding “came in under the wire: had it been one day later, we would not have been \nable to make payroll on Friday, February 7.”  ECF No. 40-3 ¶ 4.  As discussed previously, all of \nthese organizations rely on continued funding in order to keep their doors open.   \nThe fact that organizations have been able to draw down funds in the immediate aftermath \nof the court’s TRO means nothing if the spigot is shut off again.  The injunctive relief that \nDefendants fought so hard to deny is the only thing in this case holding potentially catastrophic \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 37 of 39\nharm at bay.13  The court’s previous order may have bought Plaintiffs a few additional weeks of \nfunding, but they remain just as vulnerable as they were in the first week of February.  A single \ndisbursement does not protect a recipient when the next disbursement is equally as vital.  Plaintiffs \nhave easily shown irreparable harm.   \n3.  Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest \nAs is the case with irreparable harm, the balance of the equities and the public interest \ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of injunctive relief.  “Plaintiffs paint[ed] a stark picture of \nnationwide panic in the wake of the funding freeze.”  ECF No. 30, at 28.  Nonprofits and \norganizations  across  the  country  were  left  adrift  as  they  scrambled  to  make  sense  of  the \nmemorandum and its effects.  See ECF Nos. 24-4, 24-5, 24-6, 24-7, 24-8, 24-9, 24-10, 24-11.  \nEntire funding portals were taken offline with no rhyme or reason, generating significant confusion \nand fear.  See ECF Nos. 24-8 ¶¶ 8-9; 24-6 ¶ 15; 24-7 ¶ 13; 24-8 ¶ 9.  Many organizations had to \nresort to desperate measures just to stay operational.  The pause placed critical programs for \nchildren, the elderly, and everyone in between in serious jeopardy.  Because the public’s interest \nin not having trillions of dollars arbitrarily frozen cannot be overstated, Plaintiffs have more than \nmet their burden here. \n \n13 The court reiterates that the District of Rhode Island’s TRO does not lessen the severity of the \npotential irreparable harm in this case.  This court has no control over the District of Rhode Island’s \ndecisions and a TRO in that case does “not block this court from entering a TRO of its own.”  ECF \nNo. 30, at 28 n.9; see Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 485 F. \nSupp.  3d  1,  60  (D.D.C.  2020)  (“[C]ourts  routinely  grant  follow-on  injunctions  against  the \nGovernment,  even in instances when an earlier nationwide injunction has already provided \nplaintiffs in the later action with their desired relief.”) (collecting cases). \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 38 of 39\n4.  Bond \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) states that the court may issue a TRO or preliminary \ninjunction “only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay \nthe costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  \nHere, Defendants ask the court to require Plaintiffs to “post a bond commensurate with the scope \nof the relief ordered.”  ECF No. 47, at 44-45.  The court declines.  Rule 65(c) “has been read to \nvest broad discretion in the district court to determine the appropriate amount of an injunction \nbond,” DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), “including the discretion to \nrequire no bond at all,” P.J.E.S. ex rel. Escobar Francisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. 3d 492, 520 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2012)).  \nA bond “is not necessary where requiring [one] would have the effect of denying the plaintiffs \ntheir right to judicial review of administrative action.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Morton, 337 \nF. Supp. 167, 168 (D.D.C. 1971) (collecting cases); cf. Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher \nEduc. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-333, 2025 WL 573764, at *29 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025) (setting a \nnominal bond of zero dollars because granting the defendants’ request “would essentially forestall \n[the] [p]laintiffs’ access to judicial review”).  In a case where the government is alleged to have \nunlawfully withheld trillions of dollars of previously committed funds to countless recipients, it \nwould defy logic—and contravene the very basis of this opinion—to hold Plaintiffs hostage for \nthe resulting harm.  That is especially so when Defendants—OMB and its director—will personally \nface no monetary injury from the injunction.14   \n \n14 The court also denies Defendants’ request for an administrative stay pending appeal as premature.  \nId. at 45.  If Defendants, after reviewing this opinion and its accompanying order, believe that a \nstay pending appeal is warranted, they may make a request consistent with Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 8. \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 51     Filed 02/25/25     Page 39 of 39\nIII.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 1 of 12\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \nNATIONAL COUNCIL OF   \nNONPROFITS, et al., \n    \nPlaintiffs, \n      Case No. 25-cv-239 \nv. \n    \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND \nBUDGET, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO CLARIFY  \nSCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nThis Court has preliminarily enjoined Defendants from implementing, giving \neffect to, or reinstating under a different name the unilateral, non-individualized \ndirectives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal \nfunds under all open awards.  Defendants have narrowly construed the last clause of \nthat order—“under all open awards”—in a manner that is inconsistent with the \nCourt’s preliminary injunction decision and order. \nSpecifically, Defendants have indicated in their notice and memorandum filed \nwith the Court on Friday, February 28, that they interpret the Court’s references to \n“all open awards” in the preliminary injunction order to mean not “all” open awards \nbut instead only those open awards that have been “partially disbursed.”  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully submit that Defendants’ approach does not accord with either the letter \nor  the  reasoning  of  the  Court’s  preliminary  injunction  order  and  decision.  \nDefendants’ cramped interpretation appears to have led to $3.6 billion in HUD \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 2 of 12\nContinuum of Care funding that was awarded to various grant recipients (including \nmembers of Plaintiff National Council of Nonprofits) remaining on hold.  Thus, \npursuant to Rule 7(b), Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court clarify that the \npreliminary injunction’s directives regarding “all open awards” applies to all awards \nthat have been awarded—i.e., that the recipient has been notified of the decision to \naward the grant, loan, or other financial assistance or the award has otherwise been \nmade public. \nPursuant to Local Rule 7(m), undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for \nthe Defendants, who indicated that they plan to oppose this motion. \nBACKGROUND \n  On January 27, 2025, news broke that OMB had issued Memorandum M-25-\n13 (the “Freeze Order”), directing that, as of 5:00 p.m. on January 28, “Federal \nagencies  must  temporarily  pause  all  activities  related  to  obligation  or \ndisbursement of all Federal financial assistance” (emphasis in original).  On January \n28, Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the Freeze Order from \ntaking effect.  Minutes before 5:00 p.m., this Court entered an administrative stay.  \nThat  evening,  the  Court  issued  a  written  opinion  explaining  that  “because  an \nadministrative stay in this case blocks executive action—a consideration that is not \nto be taken lightly—the court will limit its duration to only the few days it will take \nfor  expedited  briefing  and  a  hearing.    It  will  further  limit  the  scope  of  the \nadministrative stay to OMB’s direction that agencies ‘pause . . . disbursement of \nFederal funds under all open awards,’ so that it is tailored to Plaintiffs’ concern that \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 3 of 12\na lapse in existing federal funding will cause irreparable injuries to recipients and \ntheir programs.”  Order, ECF No. 13, at 4 (Jan. 28, 2025).  As the Court explained, \n“[i]n this way, the administrative stay does not affect OMB’s memorandum as it \npertains to ‘issuance of new awards’ or ‘other relevant agency actions that may be \nimplicated by the executive orders.’”  Id.  The Court therefore ordered Defendants to \n“refrain  from  implementing  OMB  Memorandum  M-25-13  with  respect  to  the \ndisbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”  Id. at 4–5.   \n  As the case proceeded, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO, and, on \nFebruary 25, for a preliminary injunction.  In its preliminary injunction order, the \nCourt directed “that Defendants are enjoined from implementing, giving effect to, or \nreinstating under a different name the unilateral, non-individualized directives in \nOMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under \nall open awards.”  Order, ECF No. 52, at 1 (Feb. 25, 2025).  This Court further ordered \nthat “Defendants must provide written notice of the court’s preliminary injunction to \nall agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-25-13 was addressed” and that the notice \n“shall instruct those agencies that they may not take any steps to implement, give \neffect  to,  or  reinstate  under  a  different  name  the  unilateral,  non-individualized \ndirectives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal \nfunds under all open awards.”  Id.  That notice “shall also instruct those agencies to \ncontinue releasing any disbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13.”  Id. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 4 of 12\n  On February 28, Defendants filed a copy of the notice that OMB General \nCounsel Mark Paoletta had sent to the agency general counsels, dated February 27 \nwith  the  subject  “Preliminary  Injunction  Against  OMB  Memorandum  M-25-13.”  \nECF. No. 54-1.  That notice quoted the appropriate language from the Court’s order \nas to the required contents of the notice.   \nThe notice went on, however, to state that in those instructions, “‘open awards’ \nmeans  all  forms  of  Federal  financial  assistance  within  the  scope  of  OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 ‘that have already been approved and partially disbursed.’  \nThus, the instructions do not apply to issuance of new awards, or to awards that have \nnot yet been awarded to specific individuals or entities (such as NOFOs).”  Id. at 1.  \nAlthough the notice does not provide a citation for the language it quotes, it appears \nto come from this Court’s TRO opinion.  See Mem. Op. & Order, ECF No. 30, at 22 \n(Feb. 3, 2025).  The notice further states that its instructions “do not restrict agencies’ \ncompliance with the President’s recently issued Executive Orders” and hints that the \ninstructions do not “restrict agencies’ ability to take actions pursuant to their own \nauthorities independent of OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”  ECF No. 54-1, at 1. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Although “there is no Federal Rule of Civil Procedure specifically governing \nmotions for clarification,” the “general purpose” of such a motion “is to explain or \nclarify something ambiguous or vague, not to alter or amend.”  New York v. Biden, \nCase  No.  20-2340,  2021  WL  7908124,  at  *2  (D.D.C.  Aug.  23,  2021)  (alteration, \nquotation  marks,  and  citations  omitted).    Thus,  “courts  in  this  Circuit  have \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 5 of 12\nencouraged parties to file motions for clarification when they are uncertain about the \nscope of a ruling, and entertaining such motions seems especially prudent if the \nparties must implement the ruling at issue at subsequent stages of the litigation.”  \nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).1 \nARGUMENT \n  There is no dispute that the preliminary injunction does not apply to NOFOs \nwhere no grant recipient has even been selected and the grant has not been awarded.  \nAnd there is no dispute that the injunction does apply to open awards that have \nalready been obligated, where disbursements have begun.  This motion addresses a \ndifferent type of open award that Defendants have sought to exclude from the reach \nof the Court’s order: where a grant has been awarded, but funds have not yet been \ndisbursed. \nThis limited category of grants includes, for example, those awarded before \nOMB issued its Freeze Order, for which final paperwork may have been outstanding \nor for which the date of the first scheduled disbursement had not yet occurred. Among \nthese are Continuum of Care grants administered by the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development.  The Continuum of Care program is “designed to promote a \n \n1 Should Defendants choose to appeal the preliminary injunction order while this \nmotion is pending, it would not deprive this Court of jurisdiction.  “When an appeal \nis taken from an interlocutory order, such as the grant or denial of an injunction, . . . \nthe district court retains jurisdiction to act with respect to matters not related to the \nissues involved in the appeal or when a district court’s action would aid in the appeal.”  \nBarnstead Broadcasting Corp. v.

Yentel Decl. ¶¶ 4–8.5  They, and \nothers with a similar posture, are most appropriately understood as “open awards” \nfor  which  Defendants  are  enjoined  from  implementing  “the  unilateral,  non-\nindividualized directives in OMB Memorandum 25-13.” Order at 1. The fact that \ndisbursements have not yet begun does not change the fact that the grants have been \nawarded to individual recipients that were counting on funds flowing as expected, \nbringing  them  within  the  letter  and  logic  of  the  Court’s  preliminary  injunction \ndecision.  \n \n4 Plaintiffs understand that, in the ordinary course, CoC grant award announcements \non HUD’s website are followed, within a few weeks, by individual award letters to \neach recipient.  The issuance of those letters confirming awards that have already \nbeen  publicly  announced  is  purely  a  ministerial  task  that  does  not  move  these \nawarded grants outside the category of “all open awards” as used in the Court’s \npreliminary injunction decision and order.  And just as the Court’s injunction bars \nthe withholding of payments on those open awards because of the Freeze Order, it \nlikewise bars the withholding of award letters that appear to be a necessary (if \nministerial) prerequisite to the funds actually flowing.  The Court considered (and \nfound likely unlawful, at least with respect to open awards) language in the Freeze \nOrder requiring a pause on “all activities related to obligation and disbursement”—a \nset of activities that includes not only the actual payment of money but also other \nsteps necessary for the ordinary obligation and disbursement of financial assistance \nunder open awards.  \n5 As another example:  reporting states that $5 million in HUD grant funding for \nMontgomery County, Pennsylvania has been withheld, and that if it is not received a \nCoC marshaling programs that assist with rent, domestic violence protection, eviction \nprevention, outreach to people who are homeless, and preventing at-risk children \nfrom being left on the streets will no longer be able to operate. See Justin Heinze, \nMontco ‘Ghosted’ By Federal Government, $5M In Critical Funding Withheld, Patch \n(Mar.  3,  2025),  https://patch.com/pennsylvania/norristown/montco-ghosted-federal-\ngovernment-5m-key-funding-withheld.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 8 of 12\n  Plaintiffs have focused their request for preliminary relief on open awards \nrather than NOFOs in large part because the harms from Defendants’ irrational \nFreeze Order would be especially severe for those who had already been awarded and \nwere counting on receiving (or may even have begun to draw on) federal financial \nassistance.  That reasonable reliance on being able to access financial assistance that \nhas already been awarded, and the harms to recipients from Defendants’ sudden halt \nto such assistance, exist regardless of whether disbursement on an open award has \nyet  begun.    While  some  awarded  grants  may  have  been  subject  to  additional \npaperwork to process the first disbursement, the kind of agency activity associated \nwith such ministerial grants management is different in kind from forthcoming \ndecisions on which grants to award under outstanding NOFOs, a category of grants \nnot covered by the Court’s order. \n  Accordingly,  the  legal  principles  that  govern  this  Court’s  preliminary \ninjunction analysis apply with equal force to grants that have been awarded but not \nyet  disbursed.    As  this  Court  has  observed,  the  Freeze  Order  was  “irrational, \nimprudent, and precipitated a nationwide crisis”; it had “no clear statutory hook for \nthis broad assertion of power”; and “may be crossing a constitutional line.”  Mem. Op., \nECF No. 51, at 30–31, 33, 35.  None of these conclusions rest in any way on whether \ndisbursements on an awarded grant have already begun or not; indeed, reliance \ninterests attach in both situations.  And the irreparable harm and public interest \nanalyses likewise do not rely on a disbursement having already been made:  grant \nrecipients expect that when they have been awarded a grant, they can count on that \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 9 of 12\nmoney, and budget accordingly.  When the rug is swept out from under them, the \nservices they are able to offer suffer, and so do the communities they serve.  This is \nparticularly the case for grant renewals, as the award of a renewal enables the \nrecipient to plan that its current level of service will continue.  See 2d Suppl. Yentel \nDecl. ¶¶ 5–6, 9.  Pausing the initial disbursement of an already awarded renewal has \nan effect that is essentially indistinguishable from pausing a renewal after the first \ndisbursement had gone out the door.   \nAlthough one passage of the Court’s TRO Order could be read to equate “open \nawards” with “ones that have already been approved and partially disbursed,” see \nECF No. 30, at 22, that (1) does not appear to be what the Court was actually saying, \nand (2) would place inordinate weight on a single line that did not appear in the \nCourt’s preliminary injunction order or decision (the relevant documents now) and \nwas not material even to the Court’s TRO analysis.  The Court included its aside \nabout grants “partially disbursed” in distinguishing Village of Bensenville v. Federal \nAviation Administration, 457 F.3d 52 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  In that case, the court \nconcluded that there was no final agency action stemming from the agency’s letter of \nintent proposing a reimbursement schedule, in part because the reimbursement \nrecipient had to file additional documents before disbursement.  Id. at 69.  As this \nCourt correctly noted, that case cannot govern a situation where funds have already \nbeen approved and partially disbursed.  That analysis holds as well for funds that \nhave been awarded but not yet been disbursed.  First, the agency action of which \nPlaintiffs complain is not disbursement as to any specific grantee, but rather the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 10 of 12\nprogrammatic “freeze first, ask questions later” directive the Freeze Order mandated.  \nSecond, as the Bensenville court made clear, a letter of intent is (as the name reflects) \nmerely a “planning document” that requires the hopeful grant recipient “to file a \nfurther grant application for approval.”  Id.  The funding decision not only “require[s] \nfurther  administrative  process,”  it  is  also  “contingent  on  congressional \nappropriation.”  Id.  That set of facts is far afield from, for example, CoC funding \nwhere grant recipients have not only filed their grant application for funds that have \nalready been congressionally appropriated, but actually been awarded the grant. \nThe Court’s explanation for limiting the scope of the administrative stay only \nunderscores this analysis.  The Court explicitly noted that it was limiting the scope \nof the stay because of the procedural posture, before expedited briefing and a hearing, \nECF No. 13, at 4, considerations that no longer bear weight after multiple rounds of \nbriefing and two hearings.  The Court limited the scope of the stay to the directive to \npause  disbursement  “under  all  open  awards”  so  the  stay  would  be  “tailored  to \nPlaintiffs’ concern that a lapse in existing federal funding will cause irreparable \ninjuries to recipients and their programs.”  Id.  The Court distinguished this scenario \nfrom the “issuance of new awards.”  Id.  As explained above, Plaintiffs’ concern applies \nwith full force to grants already awarded, which are quite different from wholly new \nawards.  Plaintiffs believe the Court’s order blocking Defendants’ directive to pause \nthe disbursement of funds “under all open awards” covers grants that have been \nawarded but not yet disbursed and seeks to have the Court clarify given Defendants’ \nnarrow interpretation of the Court’s ruling.  To the extent that the Court understands \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 56     Filed 03/04/25     Page 11 of 12\nits  order  not  to  have  addressed  awards  that  were  awarded  but  not  disbursed, \nPlaintiffs ask that the Court address such awards now.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should enter the attached proposed order \nclarifying that the preliminary injunction’s directive as to “all open awards” applies \nto federal grants that have been awarded, and directing that Defendants clarify and \nreissue their notice to agencies accordingly. \n \nDated:  March 4, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Jessica Anne Morton \nJessica Anne Morton (DC Bar No. 1032316) \nKevin E.

To facilitate a \nreview of that funding for conformity with the new administration’s ideological \nviews, Defendants ordered that essentially all of it be shut off in 24 hours. \nThat agency action was unlawful. It violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct because it was arbitrary and capricious, undertaken without statutory \n \n1 The Senate voted to confirm Russell Vought as Director of OMB on February 6, \n2025.

And its effect would devastate \nPlaintiffs here—the National Council of Nonprofits, the American Public Health \nAssociation, Main Street Alliance, and SAGE—groups representing thousands of \nnonprofits and small businesses that rely on the federal financial assistance \nprograms that Defendants seek to throttle. \nThe Court rightly entered a temporary restraining order to stop that \nirreparable harm. The same factors the Court previously considered now justify a \npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs remain likely to succeed on all three of their \nclaims. The freeze would cause irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and their members by \npunishing their exercise of core First Amendment rights, thwarting their ability to \ncarry out their core missions, and in many cases inflicting existential economic \ninjury. And the public interest strongly favors relief that would prevent Defendants \nfrom continuing to implement the Freeze Order, including under a different name.  \nThe slow and disorderly process by which funds have become unfrozen since \nthe Court issued its TRO—to the extent they actually have been unfrozen, but see \nJonathan Allen, FEMA Official Ignores Judge’s Latest Order, Demands Freeze on \nGrant Funding, NBC News (Feb. 11, 2025) (reporting on FEMA’s freezing of \nfunding “for grant programs going back several years, including those focused on \nemergency preparedness, homeland security, firefighting, protecting churches from \nterrorism and tribal security”)2—only serves to underscore the need for preliminary \n \n2 https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fema-official-ignores-judge-order-\nfreeze-grant-funding-rcna191674 \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 38\nrelief to bar another precipitous and poorly considered blanket freeze that will be \neven more difficult to unwind after the fact. \nBACKGROUND   \nA. The Freeze Order commands a near immediate halt to federal \nfinancial assistance. \n \nShortly after taking office, President Trump began to issue a number of \nexecutive orders announcing his administration’s priorities. Some but not all of \nthese orders direct agencies to take steps to review and in some instances halt \nfederal funding in certain specific areas. See Exec. Order No. 14,151, Ending \nRadical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8339, 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (directing agencies to “terminate, to the maximum extent \nallowed by law, . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts” within 60 days); Exec. Order \nNo. 14,169, Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8619, 8619 (Jan. 20, 2025) (directing agencies to “immediately pause new \nobligations and disbursements of development assistance funds”). \nOn January 27, 2025, Defendants issued a “Memorandum for Heads of \nExecutive Departments and Agencies,” numbered M-25-13 and titled “Temporary \nPause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs” (the \n“Freeze Order” or “Order”). The Order states that in the last fiscal year, the United \nStates spent more than $3 trillion on federal financial assistance programs such as \ngrants and loans. Order at 1. It warns that these programs “should be dedicated to \nadvancing Administration priorities” such as “ending ‘wokeness’” and should not be \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 4 of 38\nused “to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social \nengineering.” Id.  \nTo that end, the Order commands agencies to take certain steps. It “requires” \nthem “to identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and \nsupporting activities consistent with the President’s policies and requirements,” \nciting seven recent executive orders. Id. at 1-2. The Order defines the scope of \nrelevant “federal financial assistance” as “all forms of assistance listed in \nparagraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of this term at 2 CFR 200.1” and “assistance \nreceived or administered by recipients or subrecipients of any type”–excluding only \n“assistance provided directly to individuals,” Medicare, and Social Security benefits. \nId. at 1 nn.1-2. \n  The Order then states: \nIn the interim [i.e., while agencies are reviewing spending for \nconsistency with the President’s policies], to the extent permissible \nunder applicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause all \nactivities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial \nassistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated \nby the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial \nassistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke \ngender ideology, and the green new deal. \n \nId. at 2. The Order proceeds to reiterate several times the broad requirement to halt \nall obligations and disbursements. It requires that “[e]ach agency must pause,” \namong other things, “issuance of new awards” and “disbursement of Federal funds \nunder all open awards.” It “directs Federal agencies to pause all activities \nassociated with open NOFOs [notices of funding opportunity].” And it emphasizes \nthat exceptions will be determined by OMB—not the agencies themselves—“on a \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 5 of 38\ncase-by-case basis.” The Order provides that “[t]he temporary pause will become \neffective on January 28, 2025, at 5:00 PM.” Id. \nB. Plaintiffs move expeditiously to challenge the unlawful Order. \nReports of the Freeze Order began to appear online near the end of the day \non Monday, January 27. Plaintiffs filed this action at noon the next day, alleging \nthat the Order is invalid and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act \nbecause it is arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and contrary \nto the First Amendment. Plaintiffs promptly sought a temporary restraining order \nto enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing the Order. ECF No. 5. \nMinutes before the Freeze Order was set to take effect, this Court entered an \nadministrative stay pausing the Order with respect to open awards of federal \nfinancial assistance. The Court did so in order to “maintain the status quo [with \nrespect to open grants] until the court may rule on Plaintiffs’ motion,” and in \nresponse to the government’s suggestion that additional time was needed for \nbriefing and full consideration of the relevant legal issues. Admin. Stay Order 4, \nECF No. 13. The Court’s order made clear that it acted to “block[] executive action” \nby temporarily halting the “direction that agencies ‘pause . . . disbursement of \nFederal funds under all open awards.’” Id. (citation omitted). \nC. “Rescission” of the Order and continuing efforts to implement it. \nIn response to this suit and the Court’s administrative stay, Defendants on \nWednesday, January 29, purported to rescind the Freeze Order through the \nissuance of a new memorandum, M-25-14. ECF No. 18-1. That memo states: “OMB \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 6 of 38\nMemorandum M-25-13 is rescinded. If you have questions about implementing the \nPresident’s Executive Orders, please contact your agency General Counsel.” Id. \nThat purported rescission was subsequently widely reported on in the press. \nShortly after Memo M-25-14 was publicized, White House Press Secretary \nKaroline Leavitt announced on social media that the purported “rescission” of the \nfederal funding freeze was, in fact, “NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze”:  \n \nKaroline  Leavitt  (@PresSec),  X  (Jan.  29,  2025,  1:40  PM), \nhttps://x.com/PressSec/status/1884672871944901034.  This  social  media  post \nexplained that Memo M-25-14 had issued specifically “[t]o end any confusion created \nby the court’s injunction.” Id.  \nThe Press Secretary’s statement that “the federal funding freeze” continued \nwas accurate. Even after this Court entered an administrative stay, and even after \nthe purported “rescission” of the Order, implementation continued.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 7 of 38\nThe National Science Foundation, for example, sent an e-mail to staff at 9:22 \np.m. on Tuesday, January 28—hours after the Court ordered an administrative \nstay—instructing them to continue carrying out the freeze on open awards. See \nBobby Kogan (@bbkogan.bsky.social), Bluesky (Jan. 28, 2025, 10:29 PM), \nhttps://bsky.app/profile/bbkogan.bsky.social/post/3lgtzpevuys2b. The text of that e-\nmail was also posted on an NSF website. See Ex. B, ECF No. 24-2. It explains that \nthe “Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-13, issued on Jan. 27, \n2025, directs all federal agencies to conduct a comprehensive review of their \nfinancial assistance programs to determine programs, projects and activities that \nmay be implicated by the recent executive orders. Therefore, all review panels, new \nawards and all payments of funds under open awards will be paused as the agency \nconducts the required reviews and analysis.” Id. (emphasis added).  \nBy NSF’s own account, it did not restore access to its Award Cash \nManagement Service, through which grantees draw on open awards, until midday \non Sunday, February 23—and the evidence shows that some NSF grantees were not \nable to actually access funds until days later. See Ex. M ¶ 3. \nNSF was not the only one. As late as Thursday, January 30, the EPA was \nstill informing recipients that it “is working diligently to implement the Office of \nManagement and Budget’s memorandum, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, \nand Other Financial Assistance Programs” and that “[t]he agency is temporarily \n \n3 See Nat’l Sci. Found., NSF Implementation of Recent Executive Orders (last \nupdated Feb. 7, 2025) (“NSF has restored access to the ACM$ system as of 12:00 \nPM ET on February 2, 2025.”), https://new.nsf.gov/executive-orders#faq2. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 8 of 38\npausing all activities related to the obligation or disbursement of EPA Federal \nfinancial assistance at this time.” Ex. A, at 7, ECF No. 24-1. \nOther agencies did the same thing less blatantly. On January 28, the day \nafter the Freeze Order was announced, state agencies were unable to access funds \nthrough the Payment Management System used by the Department of Labor and \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to disburse funds on open awards. \nEx. C, at 9-10, ECF No. 24-3. The next morning, tribes were still locked out of \nfunding portals administered by the Department of Justice and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development and could not draw on open awards, including for \ngrants under the Tribal Governments Program, which funds efforts to curtail \nviolent crimes against women. Ex. E, ECF No. 24-5 ¶¶ 14–16.  \nFunds were still becoming frozen, and remaining frozen, days after the Order \nwas supposedly rescinded, with consequences for everything from disability care, \nEx. L, ECF No. 27-1, to Head Start programs,4 to community health centers5—\nprograms with no conceivable connection to any of the handful of executive orders \nthat could be read to themselves order pauses on funding. \n \n4 Moriah Balingit, Still Locked Out Of Federal Funding, Several Head Start \nPreschools May Need to Close Temporarily, Associated Press (Feb. 4, \n2025), https://apnews.com/article/head-start-blackouts-trump-\n6e7655e56c0b451092411e7fdd1def2e. \n5 Sarah Kliff & Noah Weiland, Some Federally Funded Clinics Still Cannot Access \nFunds After A Grant Freeze, N.Y.

Events since the Court’s entry of a TRO. \n  After briefing and a hearing, the Court on February 3 denied Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss and granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. \nECF No. 30 (“TRO Order”). The TRO enjoined Defendants from “implementing, \ngiving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the directives in [the Freeze \nOrder] with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.” \nId. at 29. It further required Defendants to provide notice of the TRO to other \nagencies and instruct them similarly not to implement the Freeze Order and to \nrelease any disbursements on open awards that were paused due to the Order. Id. \n  Since the Court’s order, it appears that the freeze has mostly—but not \nentirely—thawed, slowly and by degrees. The individual declarants who at the TRO \nstage described their difficulties accessing funds have since been able to draw on \ntheir open awards. See, e.g., Ex. M ¶ 3 (funds unfrozen February 6); Ex. N ¶ 5 \n(funds unfrozen February 5); Ex. O ¶ 4 (funds unfrozen February 4). Many others of \nPlaintiffs’ members are now also able to draw on open awards. And yet reporting \nsuggests that the freeze is still at least partly in effect. See Allen, supra at 2 \n(describing FEMA’s continuation of the Freeze Order).6 As these recent events \n \n6 As of the time of this filing, counsel for Defendants informed Plaintiffs’ counsel \nthat they were looking into this report but did not yet have full details to share. \nCounsel for Defendants stated their preliminary understanding that there is not a \nblanket pause or freeze on funding for FEMA grants, but rather “a new review \nprocess before releasing funds for reimbursement.” Given that the reporting \ndescribes an e-mail from the director of FEMA’s Office of Grant Administration with \nthe subject line, “URGENT: Holds on awards,” that directed her team to “put \nfinancial holds on all of your awards -- all open awards, all years (2021, 2022, 2023, \n2024),” see Allen, supra at 2, Plaintiffs await further details about that e-mail and \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 10 of 38\nreflect, restoring funding has been far more time-consuming and cumbersome than \nshutting it off in the first place—to the extent it is restored at all.  \nE. Parallel litigation challenging the Freeze Order. \nOn the same day Plaintiffs filed this suit, 22 states and the District of \nColumbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and \nalso sought a TRO to halt implementation of the Freeze Order. See Compl., New \nYork v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 28, 2025), ECF No. 1. The court granted \nthat motion on January 31. New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 357368. The TRO it \nentered swept broadly, categorically ordering Defendants not to “pause, freeze, \nimpede, block, cancel, or terminate Defendants’ compliance with awards and \nobligations to provide federal financial assistance to the States.” Id. at *5. \nThe plaintiff attorneys general moved for a preliminary injunction on \nFebruary 7. “[F]or good cause including the complexity of the issues involved, the \nnumber of parties, and the need to maintain the status quo while this matter is \nbeing expeditiously litigated,” the Court extended the TRO “until the Court enters \nan order on the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction.” Minute Entry, New \nYork v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 6, 2025). The motion is set to be fully \nbriefed by February 14. \nAlso on February 7, the plaintiff attorneys general filed a “motion for \nenforcement of the temporary restraining order.” New York v. Trump, ECF No. 66. \nThe motion described that, a week after the court entered its TRO, “Plaintiff States \n \nthe processes currently in place at FEMA, and respectfully note that, as details \nemerge, additional expeditious briefing may be appropriate. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 11 of 38\nand entities within the Plaintiff States continue to be denied access to federal \nfunds.” Id. at 1-2. The court granted the states’ motion on February 10, finding that \nthey “have presented evidence … that the Defendants in some cases have continued \nto improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of \nappropriated federal funds.” Order at 2, New York v. Trump, ECF No. 96. The court \ntherefore ordered the defendants to “immediately end any federal funding pause \nduring the pendency of the TRO” and “take every step necessary to effectuate the \nTRO.” Id. at 4. The government has noticed an appeal of these orders. ECF No. 98. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that [it] is likely \nto succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 20 (2008). The final two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing \nparty.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  \nIn this Circuit, “[t]he four factors have typically been evaluated on a ‘sliding \nscale.’” Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 2009); \nsee also Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(noting “arguabl[e] . . . tension” between this approach and Winter but declining to \nrepudiate it). Under the “sliding scale” approach, “[i]f the movant makes an \nunusually strong showing on one of the factors, then it does not necessarily have to \nmake as strong a showing on another factor.” Davis, 571 F.3d at 1291-92.  \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 12 of 38\nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \n  Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims that the Freeze Order is \narbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and contrary to the First \nAmendment. \nA. The Freeze Order is final agency action. \n  The Administrative Procedure Act makes reviewable “final agency action.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 704. For agency action to be “final” it must (1) “mark the consummation of \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) “be one by which rights or obligations \nhave been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (quotation marks omitted). \n  The Freeze Order marks the “consummation” of OMB’s decisionmaking \nprocess with respect to the freeze on federal financial assistance because—far from \nbeing “merely tentative or interlocutory,” see id. at 178—it is a final directive from \nOMB, signed by the head of that agency, commanding other agencies to take \nspecific and almost immediate action. See Order at 2 (“Federal agencies must \ntemporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all \nFederal financial assistance. . . .”); cf. Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d 267, 292 \n(W.D. La. 2022) (collecting over a dozen cases in which courts found final agency \naction where agencies paused or delayed particular programs). \nThe Freeze Order is also one “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow,” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–\n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 13 of 38\n78 (quotation marks omitted), because its direct result (and express purpose) is to \ncut off access to federal financial assistance for recipients with open awards who \nwould otherwise have a right to access those funds in the ordinary course.  \nDefendants previously disputed the second of these elements, arguing that no \nlegal consequences flow from the Freeze Order because it “did not itself determine \nwhich funds or grants should be paused; instead, it required agencies to make that \ndetermination, consistent with their own authorities.” ECF No. 20, at 14. \nDefendants are wrong on both counts. The Order does “determine which funds or \ngrants should be paused”: It tells agencies to halt “all activities related to obligation \nor disbursement of all Federal financial assistance,” Order at 2 (emphasis added), a \nterm it specifically defines by reference to 2 C.F.R. § 200.1 and after excluding \nMedicare and Social Security benefits, id. at 1 nn.1–2. \nNor does the Order leave it to agency discretion to decide what to pause. By \nits unmistakable terms, it commands. The Order directs agencies that they: “must \ntemporarily pause” the obligation and disbursement of all covered federal \nfinancial assistance by 5 p.m. the next day; “must complete a comprehensive \nanalysis of all of their Federal financial assistance programs”; “must pause,” among \nother things, “disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards”; “must, for \neach Federal financial assistance program” take certain additional steps; and \nfurther “directs Federal agencies to pause all activities associated with open NOFOs \n[notices of funding opportunity].” Id. at 2. As the Court previously observed, the \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 14 of 38\nFreeze Order “is not merely a guidance. It is a directive that immediately produced \nlegal consequences across the entire federal funding system.” TRO Order at 21-22. \nThat is so notwithstanding that the Order modifies some (but not all) of its \ncommands with the phrase “to the extent permissible under applicable law,” or \nsimilar. For two reasons, agencies’ discretion under the Freeze Order is not \nexpanded in any relevant way by the caveat that they act in accordance with law.  \nFirst, agencies had no practical ability to give effect to the “permissible under \napplicable law” language in the 24 hours they were given to shut off perhaps \ntrillions of dollars in federal funding. After all, “it is unclear whether twenty-four \nhours is sufficient time for an agency to independently review a single grant, let \nalone hundreds of thousands of them.” TRO Order at 17.  \nThat reality puts this case a world away from Building & Construction Trade \nDepartment, AFL-CIO v. Allbaugh, on which Defendants have relied and where the \ncourt held that the “mere possibility that some agency might make a legally suspect \ndecision” in the future did not justify enjoining a policy that was “above suspicion in \nthe ordinary course of administration.” 295 F.3d 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The Freeze \nOrder’s directive to halt essentially all federal financial assistance within 24 hours \ncan hardly be compared to a policy found to fall well within “the ordinary course of \nadministration.” Id. And, unlike the policy in Allbaugh, the Freeze Order plainly \ncreates more than a “mere possibility that some agency might make a legally \nsuspect decision.” See id. (emphasis added); cf. City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. \nTrump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1239 (9th Cir. 2018) (rejecting the government’s attempted \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 15 of 38\nreliance on Allbaugh in analogous circumstances and emphasizing that “[s]avings \nclauses are read in their context”); Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 289-90 \n(same). \nSecond, even if agencies could have given effect to the “permissible under \napplicable law” language, that would not expand their discretion in any way that \nmatters for the “final agency action” analysis. All it would mean, at most, is that the \nOrder told agencies to halt payments on open awards that they could legally halt, \nrather than halting payments on open awards, full stop. In either case, agencies \nwould be stopping payments at the command of the Freeze Order, and thus the \nOrder would have exactly the kind of legal consequences necessary for it to qualify \nas final agency action. \nB. The Freeze Order is arbitrary and capricious. \n  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). “The scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and \ncapricious’ standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that \nof the agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). Nevertheless, a reviewing court “must ensure, \namong other things, that the agency has offered ‘a satisfactory explanation for its \naction[,] including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.’” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43). \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 16 of 38\nAn agency falls short of this requirement when it “entirely fail[s] to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \n  Plaintiffs are likely to show that the Freeze Order flunks this test multiple \ntimes over. The Order, again, commands a near immediate freeze on all obligations \nand disbursements of essentially all federal financial assistance. It recognizes that \nsuch assistance involves literally trillions of dollars each year, yet gives agencies \nonly until 5 p.m. the next day to halt such funding, subject only to the caveat—\nmeaningless in this context—“to the extent permissible under applicable law.” \nThe Order gives no indication when the “temporary pause” might end. As \njustification for immediately and indefinitely halting necessary funding for \ncommunity health clinics, emergency centers, Head Start programs, disaster relief, \nscientific research, state agencies, small businesses, and much more across the \ncountry, the Order states that such a halt “will provide the Administration time to \nreview agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those \nprograms consistent with the law and the President’s priorities.” Order at 2. \n  As the Court aptly put it, “[t]o say that OMB ‘failed to consider an important \naspect of the problem’ would be putting it mildly.” TRO Order at 24. The Freeze \nOrder fails even to acknowledge—let alone try to ameliorate—the catastrophic \neffects of suddenly cutting funding to thousands of community nonprofits, small \nbusinesses, state programs, and other recipients of federal financial assistance \nnationwide. An agency action that completely fails to consider its most direct and \nobvious practical consequences is by definition arbitrary and capricious. Cf. Ohio v. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 17 of 38\nEPA, 603 U.S. at 293-94 (holding that EPA likely acted arbitrarily and capriciously \nwhere it purportedly did not consider the specific question of how the number of \nstates participating in an emissions-limitation plan would “affect what measures \nmaximize cost-effective downwind air-quality improvements”). That is particularly \ntrue where those consequences are of the magnitude they are here. \nThe Order fails to consider other important aspects of the problem as well. \nIt does not acknowledge the vital services that recipients of federal financial \nassistance provide to their communities and the nation. See, e.g., Ex. D, ECF \nNo. 24-4 ¶ 4 (“provid[ing] primary medical, dental, and behavioral health services to \na rural, underserved population”); Ex. E, ECF No. 24-5 ¶ 26 (providing essential \nday-to-day governmental services “like healthcare, sanitation, housing and food \nassistance, child safety, and more”); Ex. G, ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 7 (providing emergency \nshelter and community-based care management for people experiencing chronic \nhomelessness); Ex. H, ECF No. 24-8 ¶ 7 (providing services to expecting families, \nincluding wellness visits, treatment for postpartum depression, and transportation \nto doctor’s offices); Ex. L, ECF No. 27-1 ¶ 5 (providing people with disabilities with \nmodifications that enable them to live in their homes and transportation to medical \nappointments and grocery stores); Ex. P ¶ 5 (providing services to prevent child \nabuse and keep families together).  \nIt does not consider the exceedingly thin margins on which many grantees \noperate or the immediate disruption to their ability to provide services that even a \nshort pause will entail. See, e.g., Ex. G, ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶19–24. It does not consider \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 18 of 38\nthe fact that, as subsequent events have shown, see infra at 33-34, funds can be \nsignificantly slower and more cumbersome to turn back on than to shut off in the \nfirst place. And it does not attempt to weigh the predictable and drastic costs of an \nimmediate blanket freeze against the stated objective of “provid[ing] the \nAdministration time to review agency programs.” Cf. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. \n743, 753 (2015) (“[R]easonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the \nadvantages and the disadvantages of agency decisions.”). For all of these reasons, \nPlaintiffs are likely to show that the Order is unreasonable.  \nAn agency is also required “to consider responsible alternatives to its chosen \npolicy and to give a reasoned explanation for its rejection of such alternatives.” \nSpirit Airlines, Inc. v. Dep’t of Transp., 997 F.3d 1247, 1255 (D.C. Cir. 2021). \n“This principle goes to the heart of reasoned decisionmaking; it is not limited to \nrulemaking.” Id. “The failure of an agency to consider obvious alternatives has led \nuniformly to reversal.” Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. v. FCC, 794 F.2d 737, 746 \nn.36 (D.C. Cir. 1986). \nThe Order fails here too. Nowhere does it pause to consider whether the \nadministration’s review could be carried out without effecting a nationwide \ncatastrophe, such as by cabining the freeze to new awards, providing more time for \nagencies to implement the Order and for recipients to prepare, or simply conducting \nthe review while allowing federal financial assistance programs to carry on in the \nordinary course. These alternative approaches and others were sufficiently obvious \nthat, “[a]t the very least,” they “should have been addressed and adequate reasons \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 19 of 38\ngiven” for their rejection. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 48, 50-51. Defendants’ failure to \ndo so provides another reason Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing the Order \nto be arbitrary and capricious.  \nNot just that, the Order fails to take into account the significant reliance \ninterests to which it would take a wrecking ball. “When an agency changes course, \nas [Defendants] did here, it must ‘be cognizant that longstanding policies may have \nengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020). Here, that \nrequired Defendants, before abruptly changing course with respect to nearly all \nfederal financial assistance programs in the country, “to assess whether there were \nreliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.” Id. at 33.  \nThe Order does none of those things. It entirely overlooks the reliance \ninterests that have reasonably built up around the regular administration of federal \nfinancial assistance (particularly but not only for grantees with open awards), fails \nto recognize the massive significance of those interests, and takes no steps to weigh \nthem against the stated goal of “provid[ing] the Administration time to review \nagency programs and determine the best uses of the funding.” Order at 2. \nThe Order’s complete failure to grapple with its effect on significant reliance \ninterests is another reason it is arbitrary and capricious. See Int’l Org. of Masters, \nMates & Pilots, ILA, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 61 F.4th 169, 180 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (vacating \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 20 of 38\nrule where agency “adopted it[] . . .with no regard for the parties’ reliance \ninterests”). \n  The Freeze Order is therefore invalid as arbitrary and capricious for multiple \nindependent reasons—a point that is merely underscored by the serious \nconstitutional questions (which the Order never addresses) that might be raised by \nan executive branch agency asserting such sweeping authority over the federal \npurse. See TRO Order at 25.  \nDefendants have previously offered a few counterarguments meant to \nresuscitate the Order’s reasonableness. Those arguments do not withstand scrutiny. \nDefendants point out that the Order describes its objectives: “to effectuate the \nPresident’s Executive Orders and ‘safeguard valuable taxpayer resources.’” ECF \nNo. 20, at 22 (quoting Order at 1). But that hardly makes it rational. A mere \nstatement of purpose does not show that an agency, for example, acted reasonably \nin pursuing those objectives and considered important aspects of the problem before \nit. See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nDefendants also note that the Order purported to exempt “assistance \nprovided directly to individuals,” Medicare, and Social Security benefits. ECF No. \n26, at 19. All that shows is that it is possible to imagine an even more arbitrary and \nirrational Order. It does not show that OMB’s actual instruction, to immediately \nfreeze all other federal financial assistance, was both “reasonable and reasonably \nexplained.” See Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. at 292. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 21 of 38\nContrary to Defendants’ claims, the fact that OMB retained authority to \ngrant “case-by-case” exceptions in unspecified circumstances, and apparently in \nOMB’s sole discretion, see Order at 2, does not “provide[] for a safety valve” that \ntransforms the funding freeze from blatantly irrational into reasonable agency \naction, ECF No. 26, at 19. An arbitrary ban is not saved by the theoretical \npossibility of arbitrary exceptions around the edges. \nC. The Freeze Order is in excess of statutory authority. \n  “Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess \nonly the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, \n595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). Again: Agencies “‘literally ha[ve] no power to act’ except to \nthe extent Congress authorized them.” Marin Audubon Soc’y v. Fed. Aviation \nAdmin., 121 F.4th 902, 912 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quoting FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 \n(2022)). Under the APA, courts must hold unlawful final agency action taken “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n  Defendants lack statutory authority to issue the Freeze Order, a government-\nwide halt on trillions of dollars in grants, loans, and other forms of financial \nassistance. The Order itself does not explain the alleged basis of OMB’s authority to \ncommand that halt. It does not cite any statutes at all. And nothing in OMB’s \nenabling statute, 31 U.S.C. § 501 et seq., confers authority on the agency to \ncommand a full stop of essentially all federal financial assistance. As Judge \nMcConnell explained in the parallel action brought by attorneys general, “[t]he \nExecutive cites no legal authority allowing it to [issue the Freeze Order]; indeed, no \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 22 of 38\nfederal law would authorize the Executive’s unilateral action here.” New York v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 357368, at *2. \n  Defendants’ response proves the point. The sole statutory provision they have \nso far been able to muster is 31 U.S.C. § 503(a), subsections (2), (5), and (14). \nSee ECF No. 26 at 16-17. Those provisions authorize the deputy director for \nmanagement at OMB, the agency’s second-in-command, to:    \n(2)   Provide overall direction and leadership to the executive branch \non financial management matters by establishing financial \nmanagement policies and requirements, and by monitoring the \nestablishment and operation of Federal Government financial \nmanagement systems. \n \n(5)   Monitor the financial execution of the budget in relation to actual \nexpenditures, including timely performance reports. \n \n(14)  Issue such other policies and directives as may be necessary to \ncarry out this section, and perform any other function prescribed \nby the Director. \n \nThe suggestion that these provisions somehow authorize the Freeze Order is \nrisible. Nothing in the deputy director’s duties to “establish[] financial management \npolicies and requirements,” “monitor[] the establishment and operation of Federal \nGovernment financial management systems,” and “[m]onitor the financial execution \nof the budget in relation to actual expenditures” can reasonably be read as \nauthorizing him or the agency to decide to simply turn off all federal financial \nassistance the next day. Shutting off funds is not “monitoring,” nor can it fairly be \ndescribed as “establishing financial management policies and requirements.”  \nAnd Defendants cannot hope to bootstrap their way into authority with the \ncatchall language in subsection 14, since that provision allows the deputy director \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 23 of 38\nto issue only such policies and directives “as may be necessary to carry out this \nsection.” 31 U.S.C. § 503(a)(14). Defendants have located nothing in Section 503 \nthat would even allow—let alone necessitate—the Freeze Order or anything like it.  \nIn contrast to the silence of OMB’s statute, many other federal laws speak \ndirectly to the administration of federal financial assistance programs. Such \nprograms operate pursuant to a wide array of statutory authorizations and \nappropriations, from the sweeping, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1396b (providing for payments \nto the states of a fixed percentage of their annual Medicaid expenditures), to the \ntargeted, e.g., 34 U.S.C. § 11211 et seq. (authorizing grants to centers serving \nrunaway and homeless youth). The agencies that administer those programs in turn \nhave promulgated their own governing regulations, 2 C.F.R. §§ 300.1-6000.1, which \nsometimes track and sometimes depart from OMB’s model policies and procedures, \nsee id. subtit. A. Defendants cannot hope to rely on OMB’s general authorities in \norder to justify action that takes no account of these many more specific provisions \nof law governing financial assistance. Cf. Am. Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113, \n1119 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that a “general grant of rulemaking power to EPA \ncannot trump specific portions of the [relevant statute]”). \nDefendants’ claim to authority is even weaker in light of the sweeping and \nunprecedented nature of the power they seek to exercise. The Supreme Court has \nemphasized repeatedly in recent years that it “expect[s] Congress to speak clearly \nwhen authorizing an agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political \nsignificance.” OSHA, 595 U.S. at 117 (quoting Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. HHS, 141 \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 24 of 38\nS.Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021)). That rule, the Court has held, applies equally in cases \ninvolving regulatory obligations and “in cases involving benefits.” Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2374 (2023).  \nThere can be no doubt that the power Defendants claim here—to immediately \n“cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine” by which \nthousands of nonprofits, small businesses, states, tribes, and others deliver critical \nservices, TRO Order at 24—is one of “vast economic and political significance.” \nOSHA, 595 U.S. at 117. Defendants themselves recognize that the Order implicates \nmore than $3 trillion in financial assistance. Cf. Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at \n2372 (considering an action affecting $430 billion in student loans). And the \ndecision to suddenly cut nearly all that assistance is one of vast political and \npractical significance, as demonstrated by the severe disruption and hardship the \nOrder has already caused. See, e.g., Ex. G, ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 19–24; Ex. L, ECF \nNo. 27-1 ¶ 11. “Given these circumstances, there is every reason to ‘hesitate before \nconcluding that Congress’ meant to confer on [OMB] the authority it claims.” See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 725 (2022) (quoting Brown v. Williamson, 529 \nU.S. 120, 1296 (2000)). \nDefendants have sought to shore up their meager claim to statutory \nauthority by pointing to OMB’s “central purpose,” which they describe as \n“assist[ing] the President in the preparation of the annual Federal budget and \noversee[ing] its execution.” ECF No. 26 at 16 (brackets and emphasis omitted). \nAgencies, however, “literally have no power to act except to the extent Congress \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 25 of 38\nauthorized them.” Marin Audubon Soc’y, 121 F.4th at 912 (quotation marks and \nbrackets omitted). The general purposes and goals of an agency, “[c]ommendable \nthough these goals may be,” do not authorize the agency to act as a “roving \ncommission” with “default authority” to take whatever actions it determines would \nadvance its general goals. Michigan v. EPA, 268 F.3d 1075, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nSo Defendants have tried to change the subject by asserting that “temporary \npauses in funding are commonplace.” ECF No. 26, at 17. The claim that the Freeze \nOrder has historical precedent, even if correct, would do little to establish that \nDefendants acted with statutory authority. See Se. Ala. Med. Ctr. v. Sebelius, 572 \nF.3d 912, 920 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“No matter how consistent its past practice, an \nagency must still explain why that practice comports with the governing statute \nand reasoned decisionmaking.”).  \nIn any case, that claim is not correct. Defendants have relied on a few \nexecutive orders involving delays in funding or implementing government \nprograms. ECF No. 26, at 17–18. But those orders were issued by the President, not \nOMB; are all of recent vintage; and all involved targeted pauses to specific \nprograms, among other distinctions.7 They are not remotely comparable to the \nsweeping authority Defendants claim for themselves here and do nothing to suggest \nthat Congress actually gave Defendants that authority. \n \n7 Moreover—although questions about the President’s authority are not implicated \nby the present motion—at least one of the ordered pauses on which Defendants \nhave relied was held to be unlawful and “beyond the authority of the President.” \nLouisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 289. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 26 of 38\nBecause no statute confers on Defendants the authority to command the \nFreeze Order, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Freeze Order is \n“in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \nD. The Freeze Order contravenes the First Amendment. \n  Plaintiffs are also likely to prevail on their claim that the Order is “contrary \nto constitutional right,” id. § 706(2)(B), because it threatens their continued receipt \nof federal financial assistance based explicitly on their exercise of their core First \nAmendment rights of speech and association. \n  The Order is not shy about naming its targets: “wokeness,” “Marxist equity,” \n“transgenderism,” “green new deal social engineering,” “DEI,” and “woke gender \nideology.” These terms describe not activities but sets of ideas and beliefs on \nmatters of deeply held political conviction and personal conscience. And it is clear \nwhat will happen to recipients of federal financial assistance whose speech or \nassociations somehow connect them to these disfavored ideas: Their funding will \ncease. For them, the “temporary pause” in financial assistance will be anything but.  \n  The effect for many recipients will be terminal. Plaintiffs’ members, like \nmany other recipients of federal financial assistance, typically operate on thin \nmargins, rely on open awards for a significant portion of their operating budget, and \ncount on being able to access those open awards on a regular and predictable basis \nin order to meet immediately upcoming expenses and cover those already incurred. \nSee, e.g., Ex. G, ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 25 (explaining reliance on regular drawdowns); Ex. \nH, ECF No. 24-8 ¶ 8 (noting that about 90% of the organization’s funding comes \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 27 of 38\nfrom grants, mostly through HHS); Ex. L, ECF No. 27-1 ¶ 6 (noting that 70% of the \norganization’s budget comes from HHS grants).  \nAs the record makes clear, many of Plaintiffs’ members cannot afford even a \nshort pause in funding—let alone an indefinite one. Particularly for these members, \nit is difficult to imagine a more coercive cudgel the government could use to impose \nconformity with its preferred views. The Order appears to already be producing the \nintended chill. See David A. Fahrenthold et al., Trump’s Attempt to Freeze Grant \nFunding Leaves Nonprofits Reeling, N.Y. Times (Feb. 6, 2025) (reporting that even \nafter this Court’s TRO, “many nonprofit groups said they still felt frozen, or at least \nchilled” and had taken steps such as “scrub[bing] websites of content that the new \nadministration might deem too ‘woke’”);8 Jasmine Mithani, Domestic Violence \nNonprofits Rocked by Trump Funding Freeze, 19th News (Feb. 6, 2025) (describing \nwidespread efforts by grant recipients to “edit their websites and public-facing \nmaterials” in order to avoid cancellation of their funding).9  \n  By holding frozen all federal funding while the government conducts a review \nfor ideological correctness, the Freeze Order “seek[s] to leverage funding to regulate \nspeech outside the contours of the [federal financial assistance] program[s \nthemselves],” in violation of the First Amendment. Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for \nOpen Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214-15 (2013) (“USAID”). “Conditioning federal \ngrants in this manner clearly would constitute a content-based restriction on \n \n8 https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/grant-funding-freeze-\nnonprofits.html \n9 https://19thnews.org/2025/02/trump-funding-freeze-domestic-violence-nonprofits/ \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 28 of 38\nprotected speech.” See Santa Cruz Lesbian & Gay Cmty. Ctr. v. Trump, 508 F. Supp. \n3d 521, 542 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (preliminarily enjoining an effort during the first \nTrump Administration to require “grantees to certify that they will not use grant \nfunds to promote concepts the Government considers ‘divisive’”). \n“[T]he Government may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that \ninfringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech even if he has no \nentitlement to that benefit.” USAID, 570 U.S. at 214 (quotation marks omitted). \nThus, the Supreme Court has struck down a number of unconstitutional conditions \non federal funding. Id.; Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 547-49 (2001); \nFCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 399-400 (1984). Even in cases \nwhere it has upheld funding conditions, the Court has emphasized that, “[t]he case \nwould be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in \nsuch a way as to aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas.” Regan v. Tax’n With \nRepresentation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548 (1983) (quotation marks and brackets \nomitted); see also Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 (1998) \n(“If the NEA were to leverage its power to award subsidies . . . into a penalty on \ndisfavored viewpoints, then we would confront a different case.”). \nTo be sure, “Congress can, without offending the Constitution, selectively \nfund certain programs to address an issue of public concern, without funding \nalternative ways of addressing the same problem.” USAID, 570 U.S. at 217 (citing \nRust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991)). More generally, Congress may “define the \nlimits of the government spending program” by “specify[ing] the activities Congress \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 29 of 38\nwants to subsidize.” Id. at 214. It may not, however, consistent with the First \nAmendment, prescribe “conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech \noutside the contours of the program itself.” Id. at 214-15. \nThe Freeze Order’s targeting of ill-defined concepts like “wokeness,” “Marxist \nequity,” and “transgenderism” cannot plausibly be described as “specify[ing] the \nactivities Congress”—or, in this case, OMB—“wants to subsidize.” Id. at 214. First, \nthese concepts are not “activities,” and they reveal nothing about what specific \nservices or offerings—as opposed to what political views or associations—\nDefendants deem worthy of receiving federal financial assistance.  \nSecond, the Freeze Order cannot be understood as “defin[ing] the limits of the \ngovernment spending program” with respect to open awards because recipients of \nsuch awards have already, by definition, established that they are engaged in the \nactivities that Congress meant to subsidize. See id. at 218 (rejecting argument that \nchallenged condition was “simply a selection criterion” where “its effects go beyond \nselection” to impose “an ongoing condition on recipients’ speech and activities, a \nground for terminating a grant after selection is complete”). \nThird, the Order’s ultimate purpose of suppressing disfavored viewpoints is \nundisguised. It is couched in a tone of schoolyard hostility that, until very recently, \nwould have been unimaginable in a formal government document. It drips with \nscorn for the opposing viewpoints it targets and openly announces a goal of “ending \n‘wokeness.’” And, of course, it orders the effective end to vital funding for those \nrecipients who express dissenting views, without distinguishing between whether \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 30 of 38\nthey do so as part of their grant-funded activities or otherwise. Cf. Santa Cruz, 508 \nF. Supp. 3d at 542 (finding funding condition was likely unconstitutional where “the \nsweep of the condition goes beyond barring workplace training promoting the \n‘divisive’ concepts to barring any promotion of the ‘divisive’ concepts using federal \nfunds”). \nThe Order runs afoul of the Supreme Court’s clear admonition that “the \nGovernment may not aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas” via “subsid[ies] . . . \nmanipulated to have a coercive effect.” Nat’l Endowment for the Arts, 524 U.S. at \n587 (quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also Am. Ass’n of Pol. Consultants \nv. Small Bus. Admin., 613 F. Supp. 3d 360, 368 (D.D.C.) (explaining that the \ngovernment’s “funding choices” will raise First Amendment concerns if “they are \n‘the product of invidious viewpoint discrimination,’ or ‘aim[ed] at the suppression of \ndangerous ideas’” (quoting Nat’l Endowment for the Arts, 524 U.S. at 587)), aff’d, \n810 F. App’x 8 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \nBecause the Order seeks to leverage money for federal financial assistance \nprograms to suppress core rights of political speech and association, Plaintiffs are \nlikely to prevail on their claim that it violates the First Amendment. \nII.  Without Preliminary Relief, Plaintiffs and their Members Will Likely \nSuffer Irreparable Injury \nAn irreparable injury “must be both certain and great; it must be actual and \nnot theoretical.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). In other words, an injury must be \nsufficiently imminent “that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief” \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 31 of 38\nand it must be “beyond remediation.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). As this Court \nhas previously found, Plaintiffs “easily meet their burden here.” TRO Order at 26.   \nPlaintiffs and their members have provided declarations attesting that even \na short freeze in their federal grant disbursements irretrievably harms their \nmission and poses an existential threat to their organizations. “[O]bstacles” that \n“make it more difficult for [Plaintiffs and their members] to accomplish their \nprimary mission” suffice to show irreparable injury. League of Women Voters of the \nU.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Economic injuries too are irreparable \nif they pose an existential threat, see Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. \nCir. 1985), or are otherwise unrecoverable (such as when a defendant is entitled to \nsovereign immunity), see AmSurg EC Wash., Inc. v. MGG Group Ins. Co., No. 23-cv-\n2416, 2024 WL 2405822, at *2 (D.D.C. Apr. 26, 2024). In addition, the Freeze \nOrder’s threat to core rights of speech and association protected by the First \nAmendment constitutes irreparable harm all on its own. See Roman Cath. Diocese \nof Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 19 (2020) (“The loss of First Amendment \nfreedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \ninjury.”). \nPlaintiffs and their members have documented examples of each of these \ninjuries. As one nonprofit leader explained, her organization—a member of NCN \nthat provides critical services to West Virginians experiencing homelessness—\nexperienced a relatively short freeze of only 19 hours. Ex. G, ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 10-11. \nBut even that short interruption required her organization to shut down programs \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 32 of 38\nthat assist people experiencing homelessness in obtaining birth certificates and \nidentification cards, as well as a “Family Reunification” program that helps their \nclients travel to their families elsewhere in the state and country. Id. ¶¶ 20-23. The \norganization also stopped intake into its rapid rehousing program. Id. ¶ 24.   \nAnother member of NCN—a nonprofit that helps people with disabilities live \nin their own homes—had to lay off three of its five employees during the Freeze \nOrder. Ex. L, ECF No. 27-1 ¶¶ 11. Had state agencies not stepped in with a stop-\ngap measure, the nonprofit would have been forced to immediately reduce its \nservices to only consumers with “the most dire and pressing needs”—forced, for \ninstance, to choose between job coaching a teenager with intellectual disabilities \nwho recently aged out of the foster care system and transporting an 86-year-old \nwoman to dialysis treatments. Id. ¶¶ 12–17. \nSimilarly, a member of MSA who runs a daycare serving low-income families \nreported that without federal funding, her daycare would no longer be able to care \nfor children with subsidized tuition payments, and that loss in income would lead to \nthe daycare’s closure in two months, at most. Ex. K, ECF No. 24-11 ¶¶ 20–22. And \nanother member of MSA explained that, unless the Freeze Order was paused, her \nsmall business would not be able to make payroll on February 7, would have to lay \noff its entire staff by the end of the month at the latest, and would, for all practical \npurposes, cease to exist. Ex. F, ECF No. 24-6 ¶¶ 19–20.   \n“Damocles’s sword does not have to actually fall on all [Plaintiffs] before the \ncourt will issue an injunction,” League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d at 75, \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 33 of 38\nbut it came close enough here to wound. The small business owner who feared not \nmaking payroll on February 7 did not receive her grant funds until February 6. Ex. \nM ¶ 3. A member of APHA chairs an organization that received its grant funds on \nFebruary 4; had those funds come one day later, they would have missed payroll. \nEx. O ¶ 4.10 And, of course, as detailed above, some of Plaintiffs’ members already \nsuffered irreparable injury while waiting for their funds to be unfrozen. \nThese close shaves—and the cuts they actually inflicted—only confirm the \nnecessity of converting the temporary restraining order into a preliminary \ninjunction to prevent further irreparable injury to Plaintiffs and their members. \nPlaintiffs’ members reasonably fear that if the funding freeze takes effect again—for \nexample, if the temporary restraining order is lifted—they will once again \nimminently face layoffs and the closure of programs providing critical services to \ntheir communities. See, e.g. Ex. M ¶ 4; Ex. N ¶¶ 7-8; Ex. Q ¶ 8; Ex. O ¶¶ 4-5. \nIndeed, at least one of Plaintiffs’ members has already changed her business habits \nas a result of the Freeze Order: She now draws down funds more frequently, taking \nup more administrative time and leaving less bandwidth for mission-critical work. \nSee Ex. G, ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 25–26.   \nMoreover, the lag time Plaintiffs and their members experienced between the \ninjunction against the Freeze Order and receiving their funds likewise counsels in \n \n10 To the extent that any doubts remain as to causation and redressability—and \nthey should not, see TRO Order at 9-13—the events following the entry of the TRO \nput them to bed. Plaintiffs complained that the OMB Memo froze the disbursement \nof open grant awards. This Court entered the relief Plaintiffs sought, and those \nfunds began flowing again. There can be no clearer evidence that more permanent \nrelief from this Court would redress the same injury on a more permanent basis. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 34 of 38\nfavor of a preliminary injunction. Because this Court stayed the Order minutes \nbefore it took effect, no funds should ever have been frozen. But, despite that stay, \nthey were—and it took days for the freeze to thaw. See, e.g., Ex. M ¶ 3 (funds \nunfrozen February 6); Ex. N ¶ 5 (funds unfrozen February 5); Ex. O ¶ 4 (funds \nunfrozen February 4); Ex. R ¶ 10 (funds unfrozen February 7); see also, e.g., Richelle \nWilson, Half of Wisconsin Head Start programs can’t access needed funds after \nfederal freeze, Wis. Pub. Radio (Feb. 3, 2025)11; Shannon Pettypiece, Head Start \nchild care programs are still unable to access federal money after Trump’s funding \nfreeze, NBC News (Feb. 5, 2025)12; Order, New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-39 (D.R.I. \nFeb. 10, 2025), ECF No. 96 (finding that pauses in funding violated the TRO \nentered by that Court).13   \nIn other words, it appears to be much easier for the government to turn funds \noff than to turn them back on. See Opp’n to Mot. to Enforce at 9–11, New York v. \nTrump, ECF No. 70 (describing alleged backlogs in HHS’s payment management \nsystem). But Plaintiffs and their members court irreparable injury each time the \n \n11 https://www.wpr.org/news/half-wisconsin-head-start-programs-cant-access-funds-\nfederal-freeze-trump \n12 https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/head-start-childcare-programs-\nare-still-unable-access-federal-money-tr-rcna190791 \n13 The government has noticed an appeal of that order of the underlying temporary \nrestraining order. See Defs.’ Notice of Appeal, New York v. Trump, ECF No. 98. The \nresulting uncertainty only exemplifies why the existence of a temporary restraining \norder in another court is immaterial to the Court’s analysis of whether Plaintiffs \nhere require protection from irreparable harm. See Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. \nHHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 60 (D.D.C. 2020) (noting that “courts routinely grant \nfollow-on injunctions against the Government, even in instances when an earlier \nnationwide injunction has already provided plaintiffs in the later action with their \ndesired relief” and collecting cases). \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 35 of 38\nfunds are delayed even for a short period. And even the uncertainty around the \nreliability of federal grant disbursements has already hurt another NCN member \nthat focuses on providing intervention services to vulnerable families, preventing \nchild abuse, and helping families stay together. Ex. P ¶ 5. That organization is \nbeginning a construction project to expand their services in a low-income, rural \ncommunity but are now forced to disclose to contractors that they may have to halt \nconstruction midstream if the OMB freeze is not more permanently enjoined—\nmaking it more difficult to secure vendors, and leading the organization to \nreevaluate whether they feel secure enough in their (already awarded) funding \nstream to break ground. Id. ¶¶ 6, 11–17. \nSeparately, Plaintiffs’ alleged First Amendment injury constitutes its own \nform of irreparable harm. “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal \nperiods of time, may constitute irreparable injury” where “the party seeking it can \ndemonstrate that First Amendment interests are either threatened or in fact being \nimpaired at the time relief is sought.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. United States, \n927 F.2d 1253, 1254 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (Thomas, J.) (internal quotation marks, \ncitations, and alterations omitted). As Plaintiffs have made clear from the \nbeginning, the Order’s targeting of particular content and points of view—\n“wokeness,” “gender ideology,” etc.—have caused them and their members to \nreasonably fear that their future receipt of federal financial assistance depends on \nthe content and viewpoint of their speech. See ECF No. 5-2 ¶ 14; ECF No. 5-3 ¶ 15; \nECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 29, 31; ECF No. 5-5 ¶ 8. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 36 of 38\nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Strongly Favor a  \nPreliminary Injunction \n \nThe Court concluded at the TRO stage that “the balance of the equities and \npublic interest heavily favor granting Plaintiffs’ request” for preliminary relief. \nTRO Order at 28–29. Nothing has changed since then. \nImplementation of Memo M-25-13 under that or any other name continues to \nthreaten massive nationwide disruption that will affect, and in some cases \nterminate, the provision of vital services from health care to subsidized meals for \nthe elderly to emergency relief to children’s Head Start programs and much more. \nSee id; see also New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 357368, at *4 (finding that, if the \nFreeze Order continued to be implemented, “there is a substantial risk that the \nStates and its citizens will face a significant disruption in health, education, and \nother public services that are integral to their daily lives”). It is difficult to overstate \nthe amount of chaos and genuine suffering that Defendants’ precipitous and poorly \nconsidered Order would continue to cause if carried out; the declarations Plaintiffs \nhave submitted in this case detail only a tiny fraction of the much larger harm that \nwould be caused. See Ex. I, ECF No. 24-9 ¶¶ 5, 7, 8. \nOn the other side of the scale is, essentially, nothing. The government has no \nlegitimate interest in carrying out an unlawful action. See C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. \nSupp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020) (“It is well established that the Government ‘cannot \nsuffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.’” (quoting \nOpen Cmties. All. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017)). And even \naccepting Defendants’ stated reason for the Freeze Order—to “provide the \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 40     Filed 02/11/25     Page 37 of 38\nAdministration time to review agency programs,” Order at 2—there is no reason \nthat objective could not be accomplished through more rational means, such as by \nsimply conducting the review while open awards continue as normal.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For all these reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion and enter a \npreliminary injunction as set forth in the attached proposed order.  \n \nDated:  February 11, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Kevin E.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 11     Filed 01/28/25     Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n__________________________________________ \n              ) \nNational Council of Nonprofits, et al.,    ) \n              ) \n        Plaintiffs,    ) \n              )   \n      v.        )         Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-239 \n              ) \nOffice of Management and Budget, et al.,    )   \n              ) \n        Defendants.    ) \n__________________________________________) \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ NOTICE REGARDING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER  \nPlaintiffs in the above-captioned action have requested that this Court enter a sweeping \ntemporary restraining order, interfering with the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) \ninstructions  to  agencies  on  how  to  faithfully  implement  the  President’s  agenda.  Moreover, \nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter this relief in a matter of hours—without any meaningful \nopportunity for Defendants or the Court to consider and address the relevant issues.  And Plaintiffs \nmake this request without any particularized showing that immediate relief is necessary—i.e., that \na temporary restraining order is necessary to avoid irreparable harm that would occur in the short \ntime needed to adjudicate their request for emergency relief on a reasonable timeline.   \nPlaintiffs in this case challenge a Memorandum issued by OMB, directing that “to the \nextent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause” certain federal \nfinancial assistance.  OMB Mem. 25-13, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other \nFinancial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, 2025) at 2.  On January 28, 2025, OMB issued further \nguidance about the scope of that temporary pause, confirming that “the pause does not apply \nacross-the-board” and implicates only those programs subject to certain Executive Orders.  See \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 11     Filed 01/28/25     Page 2 of 3\nGuidance (attached hereto) at 1 (“Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders \nis not subject to the pause.”).  Undersigned counsel e-mailed a copy of this Guidance to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel at approximately 1:31 p.m. ET on January 28, 2025. \nParticularly in light of this Guidance, Plaintiffs have not established the need for immediate \nrelief within the next several hours. Based on the current record, they have not shown which (if \nany) of their identified grant programs may even be affected by the pause. Moreover, even if a \nparticular grant program involving Plaintiffs is paused, Plaintiffs have not established that they \notherwise would expect to receive payments under that grant program within the next several days \nor even weeks—which is the only timeframe relevant to Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary \nrestraining order that would last, at most, 14 days subject to renewal.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2). \nNor have Plaintiff established that any temporary delay in such payments, for the short time needed \nto litigate their motion on a reasonable timeframe, would cause catastrophic harms requiring earlier \naction. \nThus, Defendants respectfully submit that these proceedings should unfold on a reasonable \ntimeline, allowing for due consideration of Plaintiffs’ claims and their request for expansive relief.  \nDefendants  respectfully  submit  that  they  be  afforded  at  least  until  5:00  p.m.  on Thursday, \nJanuary 30, 2025, to file a written opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion, at which point Defendants \nwould be available on Friday, January 31, 2025 (or any date thereafter) for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ \nmotion. \nDated: January 28, 2025        Respectfully Submitted,     \n       \n              BRETT A.

That is what President Trump has done in several Executive \nOrders including directions on federal spending, and that is what OMB did in the now-withdrawn \nMemorandum that is the focus of Plaintiffs’ claims in this case. See OMB Mem. M-25-13, \nTemporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, \n2025) (“OMB Memo”).  Indeed, the President’s authority to direct subordinate agencies to \nimplement his agenda, subject to those agencies’ own statutory authorities, is well-established in \nnumerous D.C. Circuit decisions.  See Bldg. & Const. Trades Dep’t v. Allbaugh, 295 F.3d 28, 32 \n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (“[T]he President’s power necessarily encompasses ‘general administrative \ncontrol of those executing the laws,’ throughout the Executive Branch of government, of which he \nis the head.” (quoting Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 164 (1926), citation omitted)); see also, \ne.g., Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[A]s an agency under the direction \nof the executive branch, it must implement the President’s policy directives to the extent permitted \nby law.”); Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“The authority of the President \nto control and supervise executive policymaking is derived from the Constitution.”).  \nNotwithstanding  this  clear  authority,  Plaintiffs  here  request  sweeping  relief,  on  an \nemergency basis, that would effectively disable the President and OMB from providing these types \nof instructions to agencies.  There is no valid basis for awarding such relief.  Plaintiffs’ motion for \na temporary restraining order should be denied, and this entire action should be dismissed. \nFirst, this Court lacks jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs’ claims in this case are directed solely against \nthe OMB Memo, which has now been withdrawn thereby rendering their claims moot.  And even \n-1- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 4 of 33\n \nprior to withdrawal, Plaintiffs have not established that the OMB Memo actually caused any harm \nredressable by an Order in this suit.  Thus, this Court lacks Article III jurisdiction over their claims. \nPlaintiffs have recently suggested during discussions between the parties that, despite the \nwithdrawal of the challenged OMB Memo, they continue to suffer harm as a result of the \nPresident’s Executive Orders which remain in effect.  But Plaintiffs cannot expand their claims to \nseek relief against the President’s Executive Orders, which are not subject to challenge.  Over 150 \nyears ago, the Supreme Court held that courts have “no jurisdiction . . . to enjoin the President in \nthe performance of his official duties.” Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1867); \nsee also Newdow v. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“With regard to the President, \ncourts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him, and have never submitted the President to declaratory \nrelief.” (citation omitted)).  Nor can Plaintiffs use the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to \nbroadly challenge agencies’ implementation of the Executive Orders.  No federal agencies (other \nthan OMB) have been named as defendants, and Plaintiffs cannot use this suit to seek relief against \nthose non-parties.  Moreover, the APA authorizes judicial review only over discrete, final agency \nactions, not generalized implementation activities. \nFinally, even if the Court could review Plaintiffs’ claims, they all fail on the merits.  The \nPresident and OMB may lawfully direct agencies to implement the President’s agenda consistent \nwith each agency’s governing authorities.  And temporary pauses on the disbursement of federal \nfunds are commonplace, accepted by the Legislative Branch, and well within OMB’s statutory \nauthorities.  Such a pause to ensure that funding is distributed consistent with the President’s \nagenda is not arbitrary and capricious, nor does anything about the pause infringe on Plaintiffs’ \nexpressive activity or otherwise violate the First Amendment.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims all \nfail, their request for emergency relief should be denied, and this case should be dismissed. \n-2- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 5 of 33\n \nBACKGROUND \nOn January 27, 2025, OMB issued the challenged OMB Memo, “requir[ing] Federal \nagencies to identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities \nconsistent with the President’s policies and requirements.”  OMB Memo at 1.  The OMB Memo \nfurther directed that “[i]n the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal \nagencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal \nfinancial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive \norders[.]”  Id. at 2.  In multiple places, the OMB Memo specified that agencies should take such \naction “to the extent permissible be law.”  Id. \nOn January 28, 2025, Plaintiffs filed the instant action against two Defendants—OMB and \nthe Acting Director of OMB—seeking an order nullifying Memo M-25-13.  See Complaint (ECF \nNo. 1) ¶¶ 5-6, 43-61.  Plaintiffs filed this suit on behalf of several associations and organizations, \nonly some of which appear to directly receive federal financial assistance.  For example, with \nrespect to the National Council of Nonprofits (NCN) and Main Street Alliance (MSA), only their \nmembers appear to receive federal assistance. See id. ¶¶ 32, 37.  The American Public Health \nAssociation (APHA) and SAGE are alleged to directly participate in certain grant programs.  Id. \n¶¶ 33, 41. \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint portrays the OMB Memo as “unilaterally terminat[ing] all federal \nfinancial assistance programs across the entire government.”  Id. ¶ 60.  As the text of the OMB \nMemo and subsequent OMB Guidance made clear, however, the OMB Memo’s pause applied only \nto funding implicated by the President’s recent Executive Orders.  See OMB Memo at 2 (“To \nimplement these orders, each agency must complete a comprehensive analysis of all of their \nFederal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects, and activities that may be \nimplicated by any of the President’s executive orders. In the interim, to the extent permissible under \n-3- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 6 of 33\n \napplicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or \ndisbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be \nimplicated by the executive orders[.]” (emphases added)); OMB Guidance (ECF No. 11-1) at 1 \n(“Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause.”).  \nMoreover, the OMB Guidance reiterated that agencies should pause their funding activities only \nwhen doing so is consistent with underlying law.  See id. (“In implementing President Trump’s \nExecutive Orders, OMB issued guidance requesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the extent \npermitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by the \nPresident’s Executive Orders.” (emphasis added)); id. (“Any payment required by law to be paid \nwill be paid without interruption or delay.”); id. at 2 (“It is a temporary pause to give agencies time \nto ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive \nOrders, to the extent permitted by law.”). \nPlaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against the OMB Memo.  \nSee TRO Mot. (ECF No. 5-1) at 16 (requesting that the Court “enter a temporary restraining order \nenjoining OMB and its Acting Director from implementing or enforcing Memo M-25-13 until \nfurther order of this Court”).  The motion contends that the Memo is in excess of OMB’s statutory \nauthority, is arbitrary and capricious, and violates the First Amendment.  Id. at 6-11. \nLater that same day, this Court held an Emergency Hearing at which time it ordered an \nadministrative  stay  of  the  OMB  Memo.    See  Order  (Jan.  28,  2025)  (ECF  No.  13).    The \nadministrative stay directed that “Defendants shall refrain from implementing OMB Memorandum \nM-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”  Id. at 4-5. The \nadministrative stay did not, however, affect the implementation of the OMB Memo as it pertains \nto the “issuance of new awards” or “other relevant agency actions that may be implicated by the \n-4- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 7 of 33\n \nexecutive orders.”  Id. at 4.  Nor did the administrative stay apply to agencies’ implementation of \nthe President’s Executive Orders. See Tr. of Jan. 28 Hrg. at 27 (“If there are executive order reasons \nor rationales for the termination of other grants either before or after OMB’s guidance, perhaps \nthey fall into the case as we proceed but they would not be subject to the administrative stay.”); id. \nat 29 (“So anything that was terminated pursuant to other executive orders I think is fodder for \nanother lawsuit.”). Because the purpose of the administrative stay was to allow “full briefing from \nthe parties and a motions hearing,” the Court set “expedited briefing and a hearing” on Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a temporary restraining order.  ECF No. 13 at 3-4. \nThe following day, on January 29, 2025, OMB elected to rescind the challenged OMB \nMemo. See OMB Mem. M-25-14, Rescission of M-25-13 (Jan. 29, 2025) (“OMB Memorandum \nM-25-13 is rescinded.  If you have questions about implementing the President’s Executive Orders, \nplease contact your agency General Counsel.”) (ECF No. 18-1).  Notwithstanding this rescission, \nduring discussions between the parties, Plaintiffs indicated that they believed neither their claims \nnor their request for a temporary restraining order was moot.  In light of Plaintiffs’ position, \nDefendants hereby submit this opposition and motion to dismiss, consistent with the briefing \nschedule previously ordered by the Court. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nAs this Court recognized, “[t]o secure a temporary restraining order, ‘the moving party \nmust show (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable \ninjury if the injunction were not granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other \ninterested parties, and (4) that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.’”  ECF \nNo. 13 at 3 (quoting Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. \n2006)).  When “the Government is the opposing party,” the assessment of “harm to the opposing \nparty” and “the public interest” merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \n-5- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 8 of 33\n \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing subject-matter jurisdiction. See Lujan \nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  Because “standing is not dispensed in gross,” \nPlaintiffs must “demonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for each form of relief \nthat they seek.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THIS COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Moot Due to Rescission of the Challenged Memo \nPlaintiffs’ only claims in this case challenge the OMB Memo.  That is the singular action \nchallenged in the Complaint, see ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 43-61, and there are no defendants named in this \nsuit other than OMB and the Acting Director of OMB, id. ¶¶ 5-6.  Similarly, Plaintiffs’ motion for \na temporary restraining order seeks relief only against the OMB Memo.  See TRO Mot. at 16; see \nalso ECF No. 5 at 2.  Now that the OMB Memo has been rescinded, therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims \nare moot.  See Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 18 (D.C. Cir. 2006) \n(“Because the memo has expired, this claim is moot.”); Christian Knights of Ku Klux Klan \nInvisible Empire, Inc. v. Dist. of Colum., 972 F.2d 365, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that case was \nmoot because the challenger “received the full measure of relief it sought through its complaint”). \nWhile  voluntary  cessation  may  sometimes  be  insufficient  to  moot  a  case,  “the \ngovernment’s abandonment of a challenged [policy] is just the sort of development that can moot \nan issue.” Friends of Animals v. Bernhardt, 961 F.3d 1197, 1203 (D.C. Cir. 2020). That is because \nthe case is no longer “an appropriate vehicle to address Appellant’s interest in prospective \nclarification of or changes to [agency policy].” Row 1 Inc. v. Becerra, 92 F.4th 1138, 1144 (D.C. \nCir. 2024), cert. denied, 220 L. Ed. 2d 170 (Oct. 21, 2024).  This mootness defect, on its own, is \nsufficient to dispose of Plaintiffs’ request for emergency relief and dismiss their Complaint. \n-6- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 9 of 33\n \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Failed to Establish Article III Standing \nEven  if  Plaintiffs’  claims  were  not  moot,  their  claims  fail—and  their  motion  for  a \ntemporary restraining order must be denied—because they have not established standing.  They \nhave not proven with evidence (or even plausibly alleged) that, in the absence of relief from this \nCourt, the OMB Memo’s temporary pause would actually deprive Plaintiffs of any funds they \notherwise would expect to receive under one of their existing grants.  Nor have they proven that \nany such injury would be traceable to the OMB Memo, as opposed to the particular agency that \nelected to pause that specific grant program’s funding, or would be redressed by relief directed \nsolely against the OMB Memo. Thus, Plaintiffs lack standing.  \nStanding is a “threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of the court \nto entertain the suit” and demands that a plaintiff have “a personal stake in the outcome of the \ncontroversy [so] as to warrant his invocation of federal-question jurisdiction.”  Warth v. Seldin, \n422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  “[S]tanding is assessed as of the time a suit commences,” Chamber of \nCommerce of U.S. v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an “injury in fact,” that is, a violation of a \nlegally protected interest that is “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical”; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the defendant’s \nconduct such that the injury is “fairly . . . traceable to the challenged action”; and (3) that it is \n“likely, as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  \nDefs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  “The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, \nbears the burden of establishing these elements,” and therefore “must clearly . . . allege facts \ndemonstrating each element,” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (quoting Warth, \n422 U.S. at 518).  Where, as here, the challenged government action governs the conduct of \ngovernment officials and therefore “the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action \n-7- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 10 of 33\n \n. . . he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to \nestablish.”  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (citation omitted). \nTo establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that the defendant’s action affects him or \nher in a “personal and individual way,” see id. at 560 n.1, rather than being a “generalized \ngrievance,” Food & Drug Admin. v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 381 (2024).  A \nplaintiff “may not sue based only on an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance \nwith law,” nor may plaintiffs sue “merely because their legal objection is accompanied by a strong \nmoral, ideological, or policy objection to a government action.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Thus, the \n“[t]he injury in fact requirement prevents the federal courts from becoming a ‘vehicle for the \nvindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders.’”  Id. at 382 (quoting Allen v. Wright, \n468 U.S. 737, 756 (1984)).  Moreover, a plaintiff must show more than a “possible future injury”; \nhe or she must show that harm has actually occurred or is “certainly impending.” Whitmore v. \nArkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990) (citations omitted).  The Supreme Court has emphasized that \n“threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and that allegations of \npossible future injury are not sufficient.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) \n(citations omitted).   \nHere, Plaintiffs raise several different theories of injury, none of which is sufficient under \nArticle III.  First, Plaintiffs assert that “[m]embers of APHA, MSA, and NCN receive and \notherwise directly benefit from federal financial assistance, including grants and loans,” and that \n“halting those expenditures will likewise halt the services they are able to provide in their \ncommunities, while risking their own financial viability.”  TRO Mot. at 13; see also Compl. ¶¶ 32-\n33, 37-39.  By invoking the rights of members who receive federal financial assistance, Plaintiffs \nappear to be attempting to assert associational standing.  However, Plaintiffs fail to specifically \n-8- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 11 of 33\n \nidentify any such member of their organizations.  This is inadequate to establish standing.  Indeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit instructs that “[w]hen a petitioner claims associational standing, it is not enough \nto aver that unidentified members have been injured.”  Chamber of Commerce of U.S., 642 F.3d \nat 199.  “Rather, the petitioner must specifically ‘identify members who have suffered the requisite \nharm.’”  Id. (quoting Summers, 555 U.S. at 499); see also Am. Chemistry Council v. Dep’t of \nTransp., 468 F.3d 810, 820 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“[A]n organization bringing a claim based on \nassociational standing must show that at least one specifically-identified member has suffered an \ninjury-in-fact. . . . At the very least, the identity of the party suffering an injury in fact must be \nfirmly established.”).  Because Plaintiffs “ha[ve] not identified a single member who . . . would \nbe injured,” they lack associational standing.  Chamber of Commerce of U.S., 642 F.3d at 200.  \nMoreover, the Plaintiff organizations cannot establish injury by relying on the OMB \nMemo’s purported harm to their overall “missions.” TRO Mot. at 13. Plaintiffs “must show far \nmore  than  simply  a  setback  to  the  organization’s  abstract  social  interests.”  Alliance  for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 394.  “[A]n organization may not establish standing simply based \non the intensity of the litigant’s interest or because of strong opposition to the government’s \nconduct, no matter how longstanding the interest and no matter how qualified the organization.”  \nId. (citations omitted). \nAt most, the only Plaintiffs potentially with standing would be those organizations that \ndirectly receive Federal financial assistance—which here appears to be APHA and SAGE.  Compl. \n¶¶ 33, 40. Even as to those organizations, however, it is speculative whether they would actually \nbe harmed by any temporary pause.  As the OMB Guidance noted, “[a] pause could be as short as \n[a] day,” and “OMB has worked with agencies and has already approved many programs to \ncontinue even before the pause has gone into effect.”  OMB Guidance at 1.  Thus, it is far from \n-9- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 12 of 33\n \nclear that any individual program or grant involving these Plaintiffs would have been subject to \nthe pause at all.  Moreover, neither APHA nor SAGE provides any information about when they \nnext expect grant payments or disbursements under their programs, which makes it impossible for \nthis Court to determine whether these programs would be affected by a temporary pause of limited \nduration.  Indeed, Plaintiffs previously conceded that the record lacked such specificity.  See Tr. \nof Jan. 28 Hrg. at 13 (“I do not believe we have a specific allegation of income as to a particular \nprogram.”).  In the absence of such proof, any injury stemming from a temporary pause is purely \n“hypothetical,” as opposed to “actual or imminent.” Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560. \nIn addition to failing to show injury in fact, Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are not “fairly . . . \ntraceable to the challenged action.”  Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560.  The now-rescinded OMB \nMemo did not itself temporarily pause (let alone eliminate) any federal financial assistance.  \nRather, the OMB Memo merely instructed federal agencies to temporarily pause certain federal \nfinancial assistance programs “to the extent permissible under applicable law.”  OMB Memo at 2.  \nThus, even assuming Plaintiffs established that they would suffer harm due to a temporary pause, \nany such harm would be caused not by OMB’s Memo, but by as-yet-untaken action by other \nfederal agencies that administer those programs and are not party to this suit.  See Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. at 560 (to establish standing, injury must be “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged \naction of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court.”); see also Louisiana v. Biden, 64 F.4th 674, 681 (5th Cir. 2023) (holding that \nplaintiffs lacked standing to challenge an executive order that required agencies to “exercise \ndiscretion in conducting their cost-benefit analyses and deciding to use the Interim Estimates as \n‘appropriate and consistent with applicable law,’” because “the mere ‘possibility of regulation’ \nfails to satisfy injury in fact”); Jacobson v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 974 F.3d 1236, 1254 (11th Cir. \n-10- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 13 of 33\n \n2020) (plaintiff failed to demonstrate standing where “a different, independent official” had control \nover the action which allegedly harmed the plaintiff).  \nSimilarly, even if this Court granted relief against the OMB Memo, that would not prevent \nnon-defendant agencies from exercising their own independent authorities to determine whether, \nconsistent with law, a pause is warranted.  Consequently, neither Plaintiffs nor this Court can \n“begin to predict on this record what impact,” if any, invalidating the OMB Memo would have. \nFreedom Republicans, Inc. v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 13 F.3d 412, 419 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Plaintiffs \nhave accordingly failed to allege facts which show that any injuries are traceable to the challenged \nactions, or that their requested relief will remedy any such claimed injuries. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS  CANNOT  CHALLENGE  THE  PRESIDENT’S  EXECUTIVE \nORDERS, OR AGENCIES’ GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE ORDERS \nThe above defects are sufficient to dispose of this matter; Plaintiffs’ only claims in this case \nare moot, and Plaintiffs have not properly invoked this Court’s Article III jurisdiction.  Based on \nPlaintiffs’ position that emergency proceedings are still warranted, however, it appears that \nPlaintiffs now intend to seek relief against a broader set of actions beyond just the now-withdrawn \nOMB  Memo—e.g.,  perhaps  the  President’s  Executive  Orders  themselves,  or  agencies’ \nimplementation of those Executive Orders.  But any such claims are absent from Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint and TRO motion.   \nThis Court should not allow Plaintiffs to expand this case and seek relief against a broader \nset of actions that appear nowhere in their Complaint or TRO motion.  Cf. Mylan Lab'ys Ltd. v. \nFood & Drug Admin., 910 F. Supp. 2d 299, 312 (D.D.C. 2012) (concluding that a new argument \nraised in a reply in support of a motion for preliminary injunction was waived); Quinn v. Dist. of \nColum., 740 F. Supp. 2d 112, 130 (D.D.C. 2010) (declining to consider claim not included within \nComplaint).  In particular, Plaintiffs should not be permitted to seek injunctive relief against non-\n-11- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 14 of 33\n \nparty agencies that have not been named as defendants in this suit, and have not been fairly \napprised of any particularized agency actions that Plaintiffs seek to challenge.  See Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 569 & n.4 (Scalia, J., plurality op.) (holding that resolution of a disputed legal \nissue “would not have been binding upon the agencies” that “were not parties to the suit”); see \nalso Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023) (“[S]tate officials are nonparties who would \nnot be bound by the judgment.”); Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 73-74 (2024). \nRegardless, even if the Court allowed Plaintiffs to seek relief beyond just the OMB \nMemo—e.g., against the President’s Executive Orders or agencies’ implementation of those \nOrders—such claims are likewise precluded.  The President’s Executive Orders are not subject to \nchallenge,  and  Plaintiffs  cannot  use  the  APA  to  broadly  challenge  agencies’  ongoing \nimplementation of their overall budget programs. \nA.  The President’s Executive Orders Are Not Subject to Challenge \nPlaintiffs cannot seek relief directly against the President or his Executive Orders.  Courts \nhave no authority to second-guess “discretion[ary]” acts taken by the President “in the performance \nof his official duties.” Mississippi, 71 U.S. at 501; see also Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. \n788, 827 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part). The Court explained in Marbury v. Madison, 5 \nU.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 165-66 (1803), that under “the constitution of the United States, the President \nis invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own \ndiscretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character.”  The courts’ refusal to \npolice the President’s discretionary acts is “a functionally mandated incident of the President's \nunique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by \nour history.” Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 749 (1982); see also Newdow, 603 F.3d at 1013 \n(“With regard to the President, courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him, and have never \nsubmitted the President to declaratory relief.” (citation omitted)). \n-12- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 15 of 33\n \nThus, to the extent Plaintiffs’ theory is that their claimed harms are now caused by the \nPresident’s recently issued Executive Orders (as opposed to the now-rescinded OMB Memo), \nPlaintiffs cannot seek relief directly against those Orders or against the President himself.  Pursuant \nto fundamental separation of powers principles, the Executive Orders themselves are not subject \nto challenge before this Court.   \nB.  APA Claims Cannot Be Used to Broadly Challenge an Agency’s General \nImplementation Activities \nIt is true that, even when the President himself cannot be sued, “[r]eview of the legality of \nPresidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a suit seeking to enjoin the officers who attempt \nto enforce the President’s directive.”  Franklin, 505 U.S. at 828 (Scalia, J., concurring in part).  But \nno agency (aside from OMB) is presently a defendant in this suit.  And in any event, the suit would \nstill need to satisfy the normal requirements for obtaining judicial review of agency action.  Here, \nPlaintiffs cannot use the APA to challenge agencies’ ongoing funding decisions or implementation \nof Presidential Executive Orders—such overall programs are not the type of discrete, final agency \nactions subject to challenge under the APA.   \nThe APA permits review only over “final agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, which means that \nthe action “must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” and “the action \nmust  be  one  by  which  rights  or  obligations  have  been  determined,  or  from  which  legal \nconsequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (citations omitted).  \nAdditionally,  these  final  agency  actions  must  be  “circumscribed  [and]  discrete.”  Norton  v. \nSouthern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA), 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004).  The APA does not provide \nfor “general judicial review of [an agency’s] day-to-day-operations,” Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, \n497 U.S. 871, 899 (1999), like “constructing a building, operating a program, or performing a \ncontract,” Vill. of Bald Head Island v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’rs, 714 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir. \n-13- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 16 of 33\n \n2013).    “The  case-by-case  approach  that  this  requires  is  understandably  frustrating  to  an \norganization . . . which has as its objective across-the-board protection of our Nation's wildlife and \nthe streams and forests that support it.  But this is the traditional, and remains the normal, mode of \noperation of the courts.”  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 894. \nHere, Plaintiffs cannot challenge the OMB Memo (or any other overarching guidance about \nhow to implement the President’s priorities) because that is not final agency action.  The OMB \nMemo did not itself determine which funds or grants should be paused; instead, it required agencies \nto make that determination, consistent with their own authorities.  The OMB Memo was therefore \nakin to general guidance, not the final agency decision as to any particular funding, let alone a \nlegally binding determination as to that funding.  See, e.g., Vill. of Bensenville v. Fed. Aviation \nAdmin., 457 F.3d 52, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that “a planning document . . . does not complete \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process”); Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l Hwy. Traffic Safety Admin., \n452 F.3d 798, 809-10 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that policy guidelines were not final agency \nactions, because the agency retained discretion to engage in case-by-case evaluation); see also \nFund for Animals, Inc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (describing “this \ncourt’s  consistent  refusal  to  review  agency  orders  that  do  not  themselves  adversely  affect \ncomplainant but only affect his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action” \n(cleaned up)); Reliable Automatic Sprinkler Co. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 324 F.3d 726, \n731-32 (D.C. Cir. 2003); cf. Louisiana, 64 F.4th at 684 (holding that “Plaintiffs contemplate harms \nthat are several steps removed from . . . the challenged Executive Order,” and they “cannot do \naway with their alleged parade of horribles in a single swipe at the duly elected executive”). \nMoreover, Plaintiffs also cannot use the APA to advance a broad, programmatic attack on \nhow agencies implement the President’s Executive Orders or other funding directives.  “Under the \n-14- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 17 of 33\n \nterms of the APA, respondent must direct its attack against some particular ‘agency action’ that \ncauses it harm.”  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 891.  Perhaps the APA would allow individual \ngrant recipients to challenge specific withholdings of funds under a particular grant.  But that is \nnot what Plaintiffs seek in this suit; they are not bringing claims, for example, based only on a \npause of funding under specific programs affecting their specific Plaintiffs.  Instead, they claim to \nseek relief on behalf of “tens of thousands of members” potentially affected by the “many, many \ngrant programs across the country.” Tr. of Jan. 28 Hrg. at 6.  Such amorphous, generalized claims—\nuntethered to specific decisions in the context of individual grant programs—are indistinguishable \nfrom the type of broad, programmatic challenges the Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit have \nrejected.  See Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 890; Am. Forest Res. Council v. United States, 77 \nF.4th 787, 805 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (rejecting a “blunderbuss challenge” in which the plaintiffs \n“complain not that the Secretary failed to take a specific action but rather that she failed to carry \nout the . . . Act’s general directives”); Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d \n13, 21 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that a “budget proposal represent[ing] the Bureau’s latest plan to \ncomply with its broad statutory mandate” was not reviewable). \nOne of the reasons why plaintiffs must challenge discrete, final agency actions is to avoid \ninjecting courts into the day-to-day oversight and supervision of agencies’ compliance: \nIf courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with \nbroad  statutory  mandates,  they  would  necessarily  be  empowered,  as  well,  to \ndetermine whether compliance was achieved—which would mean that it would \nultimately become the task of the supervising court, rather than the agency, to work \nout compliance with the broad statutory mandate, injecting the judge into day-to-\nday agency management. \nSUWA, 542 U.S. at 66-67.  That concern is particularly apt here.  Whatever the scope of Plaintiffs’ \nchallenges, it is virtually impossible to imagine a court order that “state[s] its terms specifically,” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(B), without also threatening to place this Court in the role of overseeing a \n-15- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 18 of 33\n \nwide swath of the Executive Branch’s ongoing funding activities, particularly when Plaintiffs \ndemand emergency relief applicable to all recipients of federal financial assistance. See TRO Mot. \nat 15-16; see also Louisiana v. Biden, 45 F.4th 841, 846 (5th Cir. 2022) (vacating an injunction \npurporting to enjoin a “pause” of certain leases, because the court could not “ascertain from the \nrecord what conduct—an unwritten agency policy, a written policy outside of the Executive Order, \nor the Executive Order itself—is enjoined”).  The inability to fashion tailored relief highlights the \nfundamental defect in Plaintiffs’ efforts to oversee the entirety of the Executive Branch’s funding \ndecisions, whether as part of a challenge to the now-withdrawn OMB Memo or to some other \nuniverse of agency actions.   \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CHALLENGES ARE MERITLESS \nEven if the Court were willing to review Plaintiffs’ claims on the merits, or allow Plaintiffs \nto expand their claims beyond just the OMB Memo at issue in this case, none of the Executive \nBranch’s actions were unlawful.  To the contrary, they were fully consistent with longstanding \nExecutive Branch authority, as recognized by the D.C. Circuit.  And the OMB Memo (although \nnow withdrawn) was likewise lawful and appropriate.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims \nfail because the Government is allowed to choose what activities to fund without being subjected \nto heightened scrutiny.  Thus, even if the Court were willing to consider Plaintiffs’ claims, those \nclaims all fail on the merits and should be dismissed.  \nA.  The President and OMB May Lawfully Direct Agencies to Implement the \nPresident’s Priorities, Consistent With Those Agencies’ Own Authorities \nThroughout their motion, Plaintiffs seek to portray the Executive Branch’s pause in \nfunding as being inherently unlawful.  See, e.g., TRO Mot. at 2 (“In practice, the Memo purports \nto eradicate essentially all federal grant, loan, and other financial assistance programs.”); id. at 6 \n(asserting that OMB cannot “unilaterally, without notice or process, purport to effectively stop all \n-16- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 19 of 33\n \ngrant programs across the entire federal government via a two-page Memo”); id. at 9 (“Whatever \nthe new administration’s feelings about the policy priorities of its predecessors, it does not have \ncarte blanche to ignore the consequences of those prior agency actions.”).  But this argument is \nfundamentally flawed for two reasons.  First, as a legal matter, temporary pauses in funding are \nnot unlawful and indeed are commonplace, as discussed further below.  See Section III.B, infra.  \nSecond, as a factual matter, Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Executive Branch’s actions is simply \nincorrect—they do not purport to issue categorical directives to pause all funding, and instead the \nPresident and OMB have instructed agencies to implement the President’s priorities to the extent \npermissible with each agency’s own governing legal authorities.  As discussed above, the D.C. \nCircuit has long upheld these types of Presidential directives to agencies. \nThe challenged OMB Memo is explicit that the temporary pause must only be implemented \n“to the extent permissible under applicable law.”  OMB Memo at 2.  The OMB Guidance makes \nthis point even more clear.  See, e.g., OMB Guidance at 1 (“Any payment required by law to be \npaid will be paid without interruption or delay.”); id. at 2 (“It is a temporary pause to give agencies \ntime to ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive \nOrders, to the extent permitted by law.”).  Similarly, each of the relevant Executive Orders \nhighlighted by the OMB Memo and the supplemental Guidance instructs agencies to take certain \naction but also includes a “General Provision[]” stating that the order “shall be implemented” \n“consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.”  See, e.g., \nReevaluating  and  Realigning  United  States  Foreign  Aid  § 4(b)  (Jan.  20,  2025), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-\nstates-foreign-aid/.   \nDefinitionally, directing executive agencies to take action to the extent consistent with \n-17- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 20 of 33\n \napplicable law cannot be interpreted as an order to violate the law.  It is plainly lawful for the \nOMB and the President to instruct agencies to act within their own authorities to implement the \nPresident’s priorities consistent with applicable law.  See, e.g., Sherley, 689 F.3d at 784 (“[A]s an \nagency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s policy \ndirectives to the extent permitted by law.”); Sierra Club, 657 F.2d at 406. \nThe D.C. Circuit’s decision in Building & Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO v. \nAllbaugh, 295 F.3d 28 (D.C. Cir. 2002) is instructive.  There, Plaintiffs challenged an executive \norder that provided that “to the extent permitted by law,” no federal agency and no entity that \nreceives  federal  assistance  for  a  construction  product  could  require  or  prohibit  bidders  or \ncontractors from entering into a project labor agreement.  Id. at 29.  Plaintiffs sued, claiming that \nthe executive order exceeded the President’s constitutional authority.  See id. at 31-32.  The D.C. \nCircuit rejected this argument, pointing out that the executive order “directs [agencies] how to \nproceed in administering federally funded projects, but only ‘[t]o the extent permitted by law.’”  \nId. at 33.  “Thus, if an executive agency, such as the FEMA, may lawfully implement the \nExecutive Order, then it must do so; if the agency is prohibited, by statute or other law, from \nimplementing the Executive Order, then the Executive Order itself instructs the agency to follow \nthe law.”  Id.  The court concluded that “[t]he mere possibility that some agency might make a \nlegally suspect decision to award a contract or to deny funding for a project does not justify an \ninjunction against enforcement of a policy that, so far as the present record reveals, is above \nsuspicion in the ordinary course of administration.”  Id. (citing Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301 \n(1993)); see also Common Cause v. Trump, 506 F. Supp. 3d 39, 47 (D.D.C. 2020) (Katsas. J.) \n(“We  cannot  ignore  these  repeated  and  unambiguous  qualifiers  imposing  lawfulness  and \nfeasibility constraints on implementing the memorandum.”).   \n-18- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 21 of 33\n \nSimilarly, here, the now-rescinded OMB Memo and each of the related Executive Orders \nonly directs agencies to take action to the extent consistent with applicable law.  Therefore, neither \nthe OMB Memo nor the Executive Orders can be construed as violating the law.  Plaintiffs’ only \nresponse is to contend that the OMB Memo provided too little time for agencies to implement \nconsistent with the law.  See TRO Mot. at 9 (“Applicable law for federal financial assistance is \ncomplex, with specific terms and requirements that vary across grant programs and individual \nawards. Such an assessment is simply impossible to do across all federal financial assistance \nprograms  accurately  and  completely  within  the  twenty-four  hours  permitted  for \nimplementation.”).  But this argument only highlights how Plaintiffs’ challenge, whether directed \nagainst the OMB Memo or other agency actions, is not a challenge to a discrete, individualized \naction but rather an effort to superintend the Executive Branch’s funding decisions “across all \nfederal financial assistance programs.” Id.; see Section II.B, supra.   \nMore fundamentally, the effective date of the temporary pause did not override the OMB \nMemo’s instruction that the pause be implemented only “to the extent permissible by law,” as \nconfirmed by the subsequent OMB Guidance:  “It is a temporary pause to give agencies time to \nensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive \nOrders, to the extent permitted by law.”  Guidance at 2 (emphasis added).  And as that Guidance \nalso explained, the only financial programs affected are those “implicated by the President’s \nExecutive Orders,” id. at 1, most of which had been issued over a week earlier on January 20, \n2025.  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ theory here, the D.C. Circuit’s cases do not require that the President \nor OMB provide agencies a specific period of time before those agencies can be directed to take \nactions to implement the President’s agenda, to the extent permissible by law.  \nAs the D.C. Circuit noted, “[i]n the event that an agency does contravene the law in a \n-19- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 22 of 33\n \nparticular instance, an aggrieved party may seek redress through any of the procedures ordinarily \navailable to it: a bid protest, a motion for administrative reconsideration, or an action in the district \ncourt challenging that specific decision.”  Allbaugh, 295 F.3d at 33.1  But the mere fact that the \nExecutive Branch has directed a pause in funding, to the extent permissible within an agency’s \nown authorities, is hardly improper and indeed has been repeatedly endorsed by the D.C. Circuit. \nB.  Temporary Pauses in Funding Are Legally Permissible \nPlaintiffs argue that the OMB Memo “is in excess of OMB’s statutory authority,” which \nthey say does not extend to OMB directing pauses in funding.  TRO Mot. at 6.  But Plaintiffs take \nan unduly cramped view of OMB’s statutory authorities, and in fact temporary pauses in funding \nare commonplace and accepted by the Legislative Branch. \nAs other courts have recognized, OMB possesses expansive authority, including “aiding \nthe President in managing the entire executive branch[.]”  Meyer v. Bush, 981 F.2d 1288, 1294 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993); see also Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, 31 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.; \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, Message of the President, 5 U.S.C. App’x 1, reprinted in 1970 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6315, 6316.  As the President explained in connection with establishing the modern-\nday OMB, the agency is expected to “assess[] the extent to which programs are actually achieving \ntheir intended results, and delivering the intended services to the intended recipients.” Reorg. Plan \nNo. 2, Message of the President.  This evaluation of programs is precisely what OMB directed \nhere, through a “review [of] agency programs [to] determine the best uses of the funding for those \nprograms consistent with the law and the President’s priorities.” OMB Memo at 2.  Such a review \n \n1 The fact that the OMB Memo and related Executive Orders only instruct agencies to act \nconsistent with applicable law also demonstrates that Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe.  See Common \nCause, 506 F. Supp. 3d at 47–50; see also Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (“A \nclaim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as \nanticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” (citations omitted)). \n-20- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 23 of 33\n \n“falls well within [OMB’s] management and budgetary role,” including its responsibility “to \nprovide federal agencies with consistent, government-wide policy guidance.”  New York v. Shalala, \n959 F. Supp. 614, 618 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff’d, 143 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 1998). \nIndeed, temporary pauses in obligations or payments of appropriations are quite common.  \nSee City of New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 901 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (explaining how \nCongress has previously “acknowledged that ‘the executive branch necessarily withholds funds \non hundreds of occasions during the course of a fiscal year’ and such delays may result from the \n‘normal and orderly operation of the government’” (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 658, 93d Cong., 1st \nSess. 41 (1971)).  The Government Accountability Office (GAO), itself an entity within the \nLegislative Branch, has approved of agencies “taking the steps it reasonably believes are necessary \nto implement a program efficiently and equitably, even if the result is that funds temporarily go \nunobligated.”  In re James R. Jones, House of Representatives, B-203057 L/M, 1981 WL 23385 \n(Comp. Gen. Sept. 15, 1981).  The OMB Memo fits comfortably within this Executive Branch \npractice of short-term delays in order to determine how best to implement programs consistent \nwith the President’s policy objectives and consistent with the underlying law governing each \nprogram, and therefore the OMB Memo’s pause is not in excess of OMB’s authority.   \nPlaintiffs ignore all of the above authorities and history, and instead base their analysis of \nOMB’s authority on a single statutory section about the agency.  See TRO Mot. at 6 (discussing 5 \nU.S.C. § 503).  But even considering only those authorities in isolation, the OMB Memo is still \namply justified.  OMB’s responsibilities include, among other things, “[p]rovid[ing] overall \ndirection  and  leadership  to  the  executive  branch  on  financial  management  matters”; \n“[m]onitor[ing] the financial execution of the budget in relation to actual expenditures, including \ntimely performance reports”; and  “[i]ssu[ing] such other policies and directives as may be \n-21- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 24 of 33\n \nnecessary to carry out this section.”  31 U.S.C. § 503(a)(2), (5), (14).  These capacious grants of \nauthority are consistent with OMB’s instruction to agencies that, to the extent permitted by law, \nthey should pause and review their payments to ensure consistency with the President’s policy \nobjectives.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim that OMB lacks authority to issue the Memo is meritless. \nC.  A Temporary Pause in Funding Is Not Arbitrary and Capricious \nThe scope of review under the “arbitrary and capricious” standard, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), \nis “narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  This standard “deems the agency \naction presumptively valid provided the action meets a minimum rationality standard.” Sierra Club \nv. EPA, 353 F.3d 976, 978 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).   \nHere,  there  is  nothing  irrational  about  a  temporary  pause  in  funding,  to  the  extent \npermissible by law, pending a review to ensure compliance with the President’s priorities.  That is \nprecisely what OMB and other subordinate agencies are legally required to do; it cannot be \nirrational for them to comply with the law in such a manner.  See Part III.A, supra; Sherley, 689 \nF.3d at 784 (“[A]s an agency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the \nPresident’s policy directives to the extent permitted by law.”). \nMoreover,  the  OMB  Memo  cogently  explains  that  its  objective  is  to  effectuate  the \nPresident’s Executive Orders and “safeguard valuable taxpayer resources.” OMB Memo at 1.  It \nrationally connects the temporary pause with this objective by explaining that it is necessary to \n“provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the \nfunding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities.”  Id. at 2.  \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion that Defendants failed to consider practical consequences or \nquantify the problem, see TRO Mot. at 8, the OMB Memo emphasized the significant amount of \nmoney that is expended every year on federal financial assistance—“$3 trillion [in] Federal \n-22- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 25 of 33\n \nfinancial Assistance, such as grants and loans,” OMB Memo at 1—and then directed agencies to \nidentify the specific assistance “that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders.” \nId. at 2. An agency’s direction to quantify the problem can hardly be impugned as irrational for \nfailing to quantify the problem. \nPlaintiffs complain that the Memo was issued without notice, see TRO Mot. at 7, as though \nthis were a rulemaking under the APA.  But the APA explicitly exempts from notice-and-comment \nrulemaking “matter[s] relating to agency management . . . or to public property, loans, grants, \nbenefits, or contracts.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2).  And to the extent any individual grant program or \nother form of assistance required advance notice, the OMB Memo’s directive to institute the \ntemporary pause “to the extent permissible under applicable law,” OMB Memo at 2, would have \nallowed (and required) the individual agency to provide such notice. \nLastly, Plaintiffs argue that the Memo was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to take \ntheir reliance interests into account.  But “unidentified and unproven reliance interests are not a \nvalid basis on which to undo agency action. Instead, the harm occasioned must be specifically \nidentified, reasonably incurred, and causally tied to the delay.”  Solenex LLC v. Bernhardt, 962 \nF.3d 520, 529 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  As discussed earlier, supra Section I.B, Plaintiffs have not \nidentified any reliance interests in receiving payments on particular timeframes that they have \nproven would even be affected by the temporary pause.  At most, some Plaintiffs might have \nreliance interests in receiving specific grant funding.  But a temporary pause does not deprive \nthem of any such funding; it only potentially delays further expenditures for the short time needed \nto conduct a review of that funding, which is a potential delay that is wholly unproven on this \nrecord.  Accordingly, these are the hallmarks of “unidentified and unproven reliance interests” and \nare an “[in]valid basis on which to undo agency action.”  Solenex, LLC, 962 F.3d at 529.    \n-23- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 26 of 33\n \nFurthermore, to the extent that reliance issues would be relevant to a decision about a specific \nfederal grant, the OMB Memo would not prevent agencies’ consideration of such interests as \nappropriate because the OMB Memo makes clear that agencies should act in accordance with \napplicable law.  In short, there is nothing irrational about the OMB Memo’s temporary pause on \ncertain  forms  of  assistance,  to  the  extent  permissible  by  law,  pending  a  review  to  ensure \nconsistency with the President’s Executive Orders, as OMB (and individual agencies) are required \nto do.  Sherley, 689 F.3d at 784. \nD.  Plaintiffs’ First Amendment Claims Are Meritless Because the Government \nMay Choose Which Programs It Intends to Subsidize \nIt is well-established that “[t]he Government can, without violating the Constitution, \nselectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, \nwithout at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in \nanother way.  In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has \nmerely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.”  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, \n193 (1991); see also Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass’n, 555 U.S. 353, 358 (2009) (explaining that \ngovernment “is not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas”); United \nStates v. Am. Library Ass’n, 539 U.S. 194, 212 (2003) (plurality) (a “‘decision not to subsidize the \nexercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right’”) (quoting Rust, 500 U.S. at 193); \nLeathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. 439, 450 (1991) (government “is not required to subsidize First \nAmendment rights”).  The Supreme Court has held time and again that the Government does not \npenalize, prohibit, restrict, or otherwise infringe on speech simply because it chooses not to pay \nfor it. \nHere, the funding pause falls squarely within these authorities.  In particular, the pause does \nnot  discriminate  based  on  funding  recipients’  viewpoints.    Nothing  in  the  OMB  Memo  or \n-24- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 27 of 33\n \nelsewhere depends on the expressive activity of recipients; the pause applies evenly to all \nrecipients in the programs implicated by the President’s Executive Orders.   \nSo long as the government follows existing law, as the OMB Memo and Executive Orders \ndirect,  the  new  Administration  “‘may  make  value  judgment[s]’”  and  “‘implement  th[ose] \njudgment[s] by the allocation of public funds.’”  Rust, 500 U.S. at 192-93 (quoting Maher v. Roe, \n432 U.S. 464, 474 (1977)).  Congress’s “broad discretion” under the Spending Clause “to tax and \nspend for the ‘general Welfare’” includes the authority “to impose limits on the use of [the] funds” \nit appropriates for particular programs, “to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends.”  \nAgency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 213 (2013).  In its efforts to \nfaithfully execute the laws, OMB instructed agencies to implement a pause, where permissible by \nlaw, to determine whether grants are being distributed in the manner that the American people, \nthrough their representatives in Congress and the White House, intended.  OMB Memo at 2 (“This \ntemporary pause will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine \nthe best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s \npriorities.”).  \nPlaintiffs object to the pause by relying on caselaw cautioning the government against \nadding conditions to spending that may infringe upon recipients’ First Amendment rights.  See \nTRO Mot. at 10.  This line of precedent is inapposite.  OMB does not seek to add any new \nconditions on federal financial assistance, which explains Plaintiffs’ conspicuous failure to name \nany specific condition.  See id. at 10-11.  Rather, OMB is aligning the President’s and Congress’s \nspending priorities within the bounds of the law, which is the statutory function Congress has \nassigned OMB.  See generally 5 U.S.C. § 503; Part III.B, supra.  \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Agency for Int’l Dev., there is a difference “between \n-25- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 28 of 33\n \nconditions that define the limits of the government spending program—those that specify the \nactivities Congress wants to subsidize—and conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate \nspeech outside the contours of the program itself.”  570 U.S. at 214-15.  In other words, the \ngovernment cannot condition funding on a requirement that recipients express or refrain from \nexpressing certain ideas, “thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected \nconduct outside the scope of the federally funded programs,” Rust, 500 U.S. at 197.  But here, \nnothing in the pause requires potential recipients to modify their expressive activities so that they \ncan “hope to receive federal funding again.”  TRO Mot. at 11.  To the extent the pause contains \nany conditions whatsoever, they are solely about the content of the federally funded programs \nthemselves—conditions that are fully permissible. See, e.g., Davenport v. Wash. Educ. Ass’n, 551 \nU.S.  177,  188-89  (2007)  (the  “government  can  make  content-based  distinctions  when  it \nsubsidizes,” rather than regulates, speech); Am. Library Ass’n, 539 U.S. at 204-05 (the government \nhas “broad discretion” to “make content-based judgments in deciding what private speech to make \navailable to the public”): Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587–88 (1998) \n(“[I]n the subsidy context,” the Government may allocate funding “according to criteria that would \nbe impermissible were direct regulation of speech . . . at stake[.]”).  And even if there were \nlegitimate First Amendment concerns in an individual case, an agency could evaluate those issues \nas part of its consideration of what actions are permitted under the law in the context of specific \ngrant programs and awards. \nUltimately, Plaintiffs disagree with the pause because it reflects their concern that the new \nAdministration  has  “ma[de]  value  judgment[s]”  and  “intends  to  implement  [them]  by  the \nallocation of public funds”—but that is precisely what the Government is within its authority to \ndo.  Rust, 500 U.S. at 192-93.  As a result, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a First Amendment \n-26- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 29 of 33\n \nviolation, and all of their claims are meritless. \nIV.  THE BALANCE OF THE EQUITIES INDEPENDENTLY FORECLOSES RELIEF  \nTo the extent this Court does not dismiss this suit, and instead considers whether to grant \na temporary restraining order, such relief is independently foreclosed because Plaintiffs have not \nproven any irreparable injury would occur in the short timeframe of any temporary restraining \norder.  Moreover, the harm to the Government and the public interest would be significant. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Not Proven Irreparable Injury In the Short Timeframe of a \nTemporary Restraining Order \nIn this Circuit, there is a “high standard for irreparable injury.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Any alleged irreparable harm “must \nbe both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”  Id.  It also must be of such \n“imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.”  Id. (citing Wisc. Gas Co. \nv. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)) (emphasis in original).   Plaintiffs’ \nmotion can be denied solely on the basis that they have failed to demonstrate irreparable injury.  \nSee id. (“A movant’s failure to show any irreparable harm is therefore grounds for refusing to \nissue a preliminary injunction, even if the other three factors entering the calculus merit such \nrelief.” (citing Sea Containers Ltd. v. Stena AB, 890 F.2d 1205, 1210–11 (D.C. Cir. 1989))). \nAs already discussed, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, and, in any event, Plaintiffs never \nsufficiently alleged injury even to satisfy the requirements of Article III standing.  See Section I.B, \nsupra.  It therefore follows that Plaintiffs have failed to show irreparable injury for similar reasons.   \nThat conclusion is further underscored by Plaintiffs’ failure to establish irreparable injury \nin the short timeframe relevant to a temporary restraining order.  As Plaintiffs themselves \nacknowledged, see Tr. of Jan. 28 Hrg. at 13, nothing in the record indicates when any Plaintiff \nexpects to receive any relevant grant payment, let alone that any such payment is expected within \n-27- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 30 of 33\n \nthe time period in which Plaintiffs’ requested temporary restraining order could last.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(b)(2).  Absent such proof, they cannot show harm of such “imminence that there is a \nclear and present need for equitable relief.”  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297.    \nAdditionally, even assuming arguendo that a payment was imminently expected, Plaintiffs \nfail to explain how a short delay in any payment could cause them irreparable harm.  Plaintiffs \nattempt to address this issue in connection with SAGE, by asserting that a “short term pause in \nfunding” would “prevent SAGE from promoting SAGEYou . . . thereby significantly curtailing \nits reach and effectiveness.”  Tax Decl. (ECF No. 5-2) ¶ 9.  But even assuming such amorphous \n“reach and effectiveness” could be considered irreparable harm, the SAGEYou platform does not \nappear to exist yet, and instead its “planned launch” is “this spring.”  Id.  Again, Plaintiffs provide \nno specific information regarding the timing of inflow of payments, let alone explain why a 14-\nday temporary restraining order is necessary to prevent harm to a platform that may not launch \nyet for several months. \nPlaintiffs’ Motion relies heavily on Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Business Administration, \n646 F. Supp. 3d 101 (D.D.C. 2022), but that case is inapposite.  In Chef Time, the court found that \nthe plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a temporary restraining order, because \nthe defendant was “in the process of distributing . . . the last of the remaining [Restaurant \nRevitalization Fund] funds” and the plaintiff would not be able to seek damages “once the fund \nhas fully expired.”  Id. at 115. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs make no allegation regarding grant \nmoney being exhausted in the absence of a temporary restraining order.  In fact, any temporary \npause in a program pursuant to the now-rescinded OMB Memo or the related Executive Orders \nwould apply to the entire program, rather than to Plaintiffs specifically.  Nor do Plaintiffs submit \nany information about whether, under their particular grants or other forms of assistance, there are \n-28- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 31 of 33\n \nadministrative schemes available for challenging the withholding of funds, or recovering funds to \nthe extent such funds were improperly delayed or denied. Thus, the reasoning in Chef Time is \ninapplicable. \nB.  The Public Interest Weighs Squarely Against Relief \nLastly, Plaintiffs cannot establish that the balance of equities and the public interest favor \ngranting the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order. These final two factors merge \nin cases where relief is sought from the government. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009); \nPursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (when the government is \na party, these two factors merge and “are one and the same, because the government’s interest is \nthe public interest”). \nIn arguing that the public interest weighs in their favor, Plaintiffs primarily rely on the \nnotion that there is no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.  See TRO \nMot. at 14.  But that is just a repackaged version of their merits arguments, and as previously \ndiscussed,  the  now-rescinded  OMB  Memo  and  the  related  Executive  Orders  are  lawful.  \nFurthermore,  an  injunction  here  would  effectively  disable  OMB  and/or  the  President  from \neffectuating the President’s agenda consistent with their constitutional and statutory authorities.  \n“Any  time  a  [government]  is  enjoined  by  a  court  from  effectuating  statutes  enacted  by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.” Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. \n1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (brackets omitted).  And where the Government is \nlegally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement or allocation of federal funds but is \nnonetheless  ordered  to  release  the  funds,  such  funds  may  not  be  retrievable  afterwards.  \nParticularly given the broad relief that Plaintiffs seek with respect to all recipients of federal \nfinancial assistance, see TRO Mot. at 15-16, the harms to the Government would be tremendous.  \nThus, the balance of the equities weighs in favor of the Government and relief should be denied. \n-29- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 20     Filed 01/30/25     Page 32 of 33\n \nV.  ANY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHOULD BE STAYED \nIt is a bedrock principle of equity that “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.” Califano v. Yamasaki, \n442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).  Here, Plaintiffs’ requested TRO—extending “to all recipients of federal \nfinancial assistance,” TRO Mot. at 15—goes far beyond that principle, and indeed their requested \nrelief goes beyond the limits of a TRO.  See ECF No. 5 at 2 (requesting that “the Court order \nDefendants to file a status report . . . confirming the regular disbursement and obligation of federal \nfinancial assistance funds” for “twelve weeks”).  Not only does such a request fail to “describe in \nreasonable detail . . . the act or acts restrained or required,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C), it also \nextends beyond the permissible duration of a TRO, which is 14 days subject to renewal. See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(b)(2). \nParticularly in light of the extraordinary breadth of Plaintiffs’ motion, to the extent the \nCourt issues injunctive relief, the United States respectfully requests that such relief be stayed \npending the disposition of any appeal that is authorized, or at a minimum that such relief be \nadministratively stayed for a period of seven days to allow the United States to seek an emergency, \nexpedited stay from the court of appeals if an appeal is authorized. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order should be denied and this entire action \nshould be dismissed.  \n \nDated: January 30, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n          BRETT A.

Even before its withdrawal, OMB \nexpressly stated that the memorandum’s temporary pause on funding was not an across-the-board \nfreeze, it applied only to discrete categories of funding, and it was to be implemented by agencies \nonly to the extent doing so was consistent with agencies’ underlying statutory authorities.  Plaintiffs \nnonetheless  continue  to  portray  the  OMB  memorandum  in  the  broadest  possible  terms, \ncharacterizing this case as being about “a government-wide halt on trillions of dollars in grants, \nloans, and other forms of financial assistance.”  Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (ECF No. 40) at 21 (“PI \nMot.”).  In reality, this case is about something far more modest—the Executive’s ability to instruct \nagencies to temporarily pause limited categories of funding, to the extent doing so is consistent \nwith agencies’ underlying statutory authorities, to ensure that such funding aligns with a new \nAdministration’s priorities.  That authority is well-settled, and this Court should decline Plaintiffs’ \ninvitation to enjoin and oversee the Executive Branch’s funding decisions.  For numerous reasons, \nthis Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion. \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot.  Their Complaint seeks relief against only one action—\nOMB Memorandum M-25-13, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial \nAssistance Programs (Jan. 27, 2025) (“OMB Memo”)—which was withdrawn weeks ago.  They \ncannot demonstrate a need for continued relief, and certainly not emergency preliminary relief, in \nlight of that rescission.  Plaintiffs’ claims are also impermissibly amorphous, essentially litigating \nabstract questions about the Executive Branch’s ongoing funding decisions, rather than seeking \nrelief in concrete factual and legal contexts.  These types of broad, programmatic challenges are \nnot cognizable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and are not ripe for review. \nPlaintiffs’  claims  also  all  fail  on  the  merits.    They  portray  the  OMB  Memo  as \n-1- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 5 of 49\n \n“command[ing] a near immediate freeze on all obligations and disbursements of essentially all \nfederal financial assistance.”  PI Mot. at 16.  But they misconstrue the text of the OMB Memo \nitself, and their PI motion wholly ignores the guidance that OMB issued the very next day, before \nthe temporary pause’s effective date, making clear that the pause applied only to discrete categories \nof funding and must be implemented consistent with law.  There is no valid basis for ignoring this \nofficial pronouncement about the scope of the challenged action in this case, and Plaintiffs’ refusal \nto acknowledge it underscores that their claims are tilting at windmills. \nRegardless, the OMB Memo was lawful standing on its own.  Given that taxpayer funding \nis finite, it is perfectly rational for a new Administration to direct a temporary, short-term pause on \nfunding to evaluate whether that funding is being put to the best use, as consistent with law.  Indeed, \nthat is exactly what President Biden did four years ago with respect to over $1 billion in border \nwall funding.  Such actions are well within the Executive’s authority, and should not be deemed \nirrational by courts second-guessing the wisdom of those policy choices.  Courts likewise should \nnot preclude OMB from coordinating agencies’ funding decisions consistent with the President’s \nagenda.  That is precisely OMB’s role given its responsibilities over financial management and \nbudget execution and performance.  Lastly, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim is foreclosed by \nlongstanding Supreme Court precedent.  If a pause in funding is enough to create a First \nAmendment violation, then the Government would be disabled from ever choosing among eligible \nrecipients for funds. \nEven beyond the merits, the balance of the equities also weighs squarely against entering \nthe intrusive relief Plaintiffs request.  Plaintiffs cannot identify any threat of immediate, irreparable \nharm given that the OMB Memo has been rescinded (and many of the funds for which they claim \nharm were not within the scope of that Memo’s pause anyway).  In contrast, Plaintiffs’ requested \n-2- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 6 of 49\n \nrelief  would  constitute  an  extraordinary  intrusion  into  the  Executive’s  lawful  prerogatives, \neffectively turning this Court into a superintendent over the Executive Branch’s funding decisions.  \nAt an absolute minimum, any relief entered here should be significantly limited and \nimmediately stayed pending any appeal that is authorized.  The proper course, however, is to deny \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, and to the extent they suffer funding deprivations \nin the future that they believe are unlawful, allow them to challenge such deprivations through the \nordinary course of grant- and program-specific challenges. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  EXECUTIVE ACTIONS REGARDING FUNDING \nOn January 20, 2025, the President issued various Executive Orders, some of which \ndirected temporary pauses in certain funding.  For example, in the Unleashing American Energy \nExecutive  Order,  the  President  directed  that  “[a]ll  agencies  shall  immediately  pause  the \ndisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-\n169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) . . . and shall review their \nprocesses, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial \ndisbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in \nsection 2 of this order.”  Exec. Order No. 14,154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, \n§ 7 (Jan. 20, 2025).  The Order further directed that it must be “implemented in a manner consistent \nwith applicable law[.]”  Id. § 10(b).  The following day, OMB issued a Memorandum confirming \nthat the Order’s pause on funding “only applies to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities \nthat may be implicated by the policy established in Section 2 of the order.”  OMB Memorandum \nM-25-11, Guidance Regarding Section 7 of the Executive Order Unleashing American Energy \n(Jan. 21, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/omb-memo-m-25-11/. \nSix days later, on January 27, 2025, OMB issued the Memorandum that is challenged in \n-3- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 7 of 49\n \nthis case.  See OMB Mem. M-25-13, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other \nFinancial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, 2025).  That Memorandum “require[d] Federal agencies \nto identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent \nwith the President’s policies and requirements.”  OMB Memo at 1.  In particular, “[t]o implement” \nthe President’s recent Executive Orders, “each agency must complete a comprehensive analysis of \nall of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects, and activities that \nmay be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders.”  Id. at 2.  The OMB Memo further \ndirected that “[i]n the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies \nmust temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial \nassistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders[.]”  \nId. at 2.  In multiple places, the OMB Memo specified that agencies should take such action “to \nthe extent permissible by law.”  Id.  Although the OMB Memo’s “temporary pause will become \neffective on January 28, 2025, at 5:00 PM,” the OMB Memo also instructed agencies that, even \nbefore completing their review of programs, they “must immediately identify any legally mandated \nactions or deadlines for assistance programs arising while the pause remains in effect.”  Id. \nFollowing reports of agencies broadly pausing Federal financial assistance, the very next \nday OMB issued a guidance document emphasizing the narrow scope of the temporary pause.  See \nOMB Guidance (ECF No. 11-1) (Jan. 28, 2025).  In particular, the Guidance stated in bold text \nthat “[a]ny program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause.”  \nOMB Guidance at 1.  The OMB Guidance also reiterated that agencies should pause funding only \nwhen doing so is consistent with underlying law.  See id. (“In implementing President Trump’s \nExecutive Orders, OMB issued guidance requesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the extent \npermitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by the \n-4- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 8 of 49\n \nPresident’s Executive Orders.” (emphasis added)); id. (“Any payment required by law to be paid \nwill be paid without interruption or delay.”); id. at 2 (“It is a temporary pause to give agencies time \nto ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive \nOrders, to the extent permitted by law.”).  Additionally, the OMB Guidance emphasized that, \nconsistent with the OMB Memo’s exclusion for assistance received by individuals, see OMB \nMemo at 1 n.1, numerous government programs were not subject to the pause: \n[A]ny program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded \nfrom the pause and exempted from this review process. In addition to Social \nSecurity and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory \nprograms like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause. \nFunds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and \nother similar programs will not be paused. If agencies are concerned that these \nprograms may implicate the President’s Executive Orders, they should consult \nOMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the \npayments. \nOMB Guidance at 1-2. \nBefore  OMB  and  agencies  were  able  to  fully  implement  the  OMB  Memo  and  its \naccompanying guidance, this Court entered a partial administrative stay of the OMB Memo on \nJanuary 28, 2025.  See ECF No. 13.  Following that administrative stay, OMB elected to rescind \nthe challenged Memo.  See OMB Mem. M-25-14, Rescission of M-25-13 (Jan. 29, 2025) (“OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 is rescinded.  If you have questions about implementing the President’s \nExecutive Orders, please contact your agency General Counsel.”) (ECF No. 18-1).   \nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs filed this case on January 28, 2025, against two Defendants—OMB and the \nActing Director of OMB—seeking an order nullifying Memo M-25-13.  See Complaint (ECF \nNo. 1) ¶¶ 5-6, 43-61.  Plaintiffs filed this suit on behalf of several associations and organizations, \nonly some of which directly receive federal financial assistance.  With respect to the National \n-5- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 9 of 49\n \nCouncil of Nonprofits (NCN) and Main Street Alliance (MSA), only their members appear to \nreceive federal assistance. See id. ¶¶ 32, 37.  The American Public Health Association (APHA) \nand SAGE appear to directly participate in certain grant programs.  Id. ¶¶ 33, 41.  Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint alleges that the OMB Memo is arbitrary and capricious, is in excess of OMB’s statutory \nauthority, and violates the First Amendment.  Id. ¶¶ 44-61. \nPlaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order against the OMB Memo, see ECF No. 5, \nand this Court entered a partial administrative stay as to the Memo, directing that “Defendants \nshall refrain from implementing OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of \nFederal funds under all open awards.”  ECF No. 13 at 4-5. The administrative stay did not, \nhowever, affect implementation of the OMB Memo as it pertains to the “issuance of new awards” \nor “other relevant agency actions that may be implicated by the executive orders.”  Id. at 4.  Nor \ndid the administrative stay apply to agencies’ implementation of the President’s Executive Orders. \nSee Tr. of Jan. 28 Hrg. at 27 (“If there are executive order reasons or rationales for the termination \nof other grants either before or after OMB’s guidance, perhaps they fall into the case as we proceed \nbut they would not be subject to the administrative stay.”); id. at 29 (“So anything that was \nterminated pursuant to other executive orders I think is fodder for another lawsuit.”).   \nAlthough  OMB  rescinded  the  challenged  OMB  Memo  the  day  after  this  Court’s \nadministrative stay, Plaintiffs indicated that they still desired relief, and accordingly the parties \nlitigated Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order as well as Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss.  See ECF Nos. 5, 20, 24, 26.  This Court held a hearing on February 3, 2025, after which \nthe Court entered a temporary restraining order and denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  See \nTRO Op. & Order (ECF No. 30).  The Court concluded that it had jurisdiction notwithstanding \nrescission of the Memo, id. at 6-19, and also that “Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to \n-6- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 10 of 49\n \nsucceed on the merits of their arbitrary and capricious claim.”  Id. at 26.  Accordingly, the Court \nordered that “Defendants are enjoined from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a \ndifferent name the directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of \nFederal funds under all open awards,” and also ordered that “Defendants must provide written \nnotice of the court’s temporary restraining order to all agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-\n25-13 was addressed,” with that written notice “instruct[ing] those agencies that they may not take \nany steps to implement, give effect to, or reinstate under a different name the directives in OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards” \nand “also instruct[ing] those agencies to release any disbursements on open awards that were \npaused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13[.]”  Id. at 29.  Consistent with the Court’s Order, \nDefendants filed a copy of that written notice with the Court.  See ECF Nos. 39, 39-1.   \nPlaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary injunction on February 11, 2025, see ECF \nNo. 40, and Defendants now oppose. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy; it is never awarded as of \nright.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008) (cleaned up).  “A plaintiff seeking a \npreliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008).  When “the Government is the opposing party,” the assessment of “harm to the \nopposing party” and “the public interest” merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Lujan \nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  Because “standing is not dispensed in gross,” \nPlaintiffs must “demonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for each form of relief \n-7- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 11 of 49\n \nthat they seek.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THIS COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO ENTER PRELIMINARY RELIEF \nDespite the parties disputing jurisdiction at the TRO stage, and despite this Court’s \nexpectation that the parties would “fully brief and argue Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary \ninjunction,” TRO Op. & Order at 29 n.10, Plaintiffs make no effort to establish this Court’s \njurisdiction over their PI motion.  Plaintiffs cannot simply assume the Court will find jurisdiction \nas it did at the TRO stage given the updated factual record now before the Court.  Nor does denial \nof a Rule 12 motion suffice for proving jurisdiction at the preliminary-injunction stage.  See, e.g., \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024) (“At the preliminary injunction stage, then, the plaintiff \nmust make a ‘clear showing’ that she is ‘likely’ to establish each element of standing.”); Leary v. \nDaeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th Cir. 2000) (“We note that the proof required for the plaintiff to \nobtain a preliminary injunction is much more stringent than the proof required to survive a \nsummary judgment motion, for example[.]”).  Plaintiffs’ failure to discuss jurisdiction is reason \nenough to deny their motion, but in any event the record here confirms a lack of jurisdiction. \nA.  Rescission of the OMB Memo Has Mooted Plaintiffs’ Claims, Or At Least \nMooted Their Demand for Preliminary Relief \nPlaintiffs’ only claims in this case challenge the OMB Memo.  That is the singular action \nchallenged in the Complaint, see Compl. ¶¶ 43-61, and there are no defendants named in this suit \nother than OMB and the Director of OMB, id. ¶¶ 5-6.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ requested relief is \nexplicitly tied to the OMB Memo.  See id. at 18-19 (prayer for relief asking for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief relating to “Memo M-25-13”).  And Plaintiffs have affirmatively conceded that \nthis lawsuit does not challenge implementation of the President’s Executive Orders, see TRO Hrg. \nTr. at 15, or independent agency decisions wholly apart from the challenged OMB Memo, see id. \n-8- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 12 of 49\n \nat 18-19; see also ECF No. 26 at 11-12.  Thus, the only challenge here is against the OMB Memo. \nOf course, the OMB Memo was rescinded weeks ago.  Plaintiffs’ claims are therefore moot.  \nSee Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 18 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“Because \nthe memo has expired, this claim is moot.”); Christian Knights of Ku Klux Klan Invisible Empire, \nInc. v. District of Columbia, 972 F.2d 365, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that case was moot \nbecause the challenger “received the full measure of relief it sought through its complaint”).   \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ motion does not directly address mootness, it does assert (based on an \ninadmissible news report) that “the freeze is still at least partly in effect.”  PI Mot. at 9 & n.6.  But \neven if the Court considered this assertion, Plaintiffs do not establish that this purported continuing \nfreeze stems from the OMB Memo (as opposed to independent agency discretion), or that it has \nany continuing adverse effects on them, as required to undermine mootness.  See S.W. Bell Tel. Co. \nv. FCC, 168 F.3d 1344, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (plaintiffs must “demonstrate a ‘personal stake in \nthe outcome’ of the case” in order to invoke jurisdiction of the federal courts, and therefore \n“[w]here an action has no continuing adverse impact and there is no relief that a court may grant, \nany request for judicial review of the action is moot.”).  In fact, Plaintiffs admit that “[t]he \nindividual declarants who at the TRO stage described their difficulties accessing funds have since \nbeen able to draw on their open awards” and that “[m]any others of Plaintiffs’ members are now \nalso able to draw on open awards.”  PI Mot. at 9.1 \nThis Court’s prior Order invoked the voluntary cessation exception to mootness.  See TRO \nOp. & Order at 14-16.  But application of that exception is inconsistent with the factual record now \n \n1 Plaintiffs also point to e-mails from EPA and NSF citing the OMB Memo even after it \nwas administratively stayed and/or rescinded.  See PI Mot. at 7-8.  As explained at the TRO \nhearing, however, those were errors, and in both situations upon being made aware of the \ninformation counsel for Defendants acted promptly to rectify them.  See TRO Hrg. Tr. at 4-5. \n-9- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 13 of 49\n \nbefore the Court.  In particular, there is no reason to think OMB would reissue the challenged \nMemo if relief were denied, given that the Executive Orders remain in effect.  Even before this \nCourt granted any relief, OMB expressly stated that the temporary pause applied only to funding \nimplicated by the President’s Executive Orders.  See OMB Guidance at 1 (“Any program not \nimplicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause.”).  Rescission of the \nOMB Memo (and press statements surrounding that rescission) cannot be characterized as an intent \nto defeat this Court’s jurisdiction, see TRO Op. & Order at 15-16, when OMB had already \nconfirmed that the challenged Memo sought to accomplish only what is unchallenged in this \ncase—i.e., temporarily pause funding implicated by the President’s Executive Orders.  See TRO \nHrg. Tr. at 15.  Moreover, and perhaps most significantly, although at the time the TRO was issued \nPlaintiffs had urged that a broad-based funding freeze remained in effect, as noted above they now \nacknowledge that not only have their identified members been able to draw on their awards, but \nmany other entities that had not been identified in the context of this litigation have likewise been \nable to draw on their awards.  Those facts, together with OMB’s decision to rescind the OMB \nMemo to avoid confusion, reflect that the Government is not adopting a wholesale funding freeze \n(which was never the intention to begin with), even if some confusion in the Memo’s first days \ncaused it to be construed by some agencies in an overbroad fashion.  Particularly in light of the \npresumption of good faith to which the Government is entitled, see TRO Op. & Order at 15, it is \nwholly speculative to suggest that, if this suit is dismissed, the Government will resume a policy \nof freezing all funding, which the Executive has both disclaimed and rescinded.   \nEven if the Court concludes that this case as a whole is not moot, at a minimum Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for preliminary relief is moot.  Courts recognize that there is a “distinction between \nmootness as to a preliminary-injunction . . . and mootness as to the case as a whole.”  Ohio v.  \n-10- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 14 of 49\n \nEnvtl. Prot. Agency, 969 F.3d 306, 309 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. \n390, 394-95 (1981)).  Whether a request for preliminary relief is moot therefore “depends on \nwhether there remains a reasonable possibility that [the challenged conduct will recur] while this \ncase remains pending in the district court.”  Id. at 309.   Thus, even in cases in which courts rule \nthat plaintiffs’ claims as a whole are not moot due to the voluntary cessation doctrine, courts rule \nthat “preliminary relief . . . is moot because defendants have [voluntarily] provided or promised to \nprovide all the relief that plaintiffs sought.”  Brooks v. Gant, No. 12-5003, 2012 WL 871262, at *2 \n(D.S.D. Mar. 14, 2012); see also Int’l Gemmological Inst., Inc. v. Indep. Gemological Labs, Inc., \nNo. 00-4897, 2000 WL 1278179, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2000) (“While voluntary cessation of \nchallenged conduct does not of itself moot an action for injunctive relief, and thus does not require \ndismissal  of  a  complaint,  such  a  cessation  surely  is  relevant  to  a  claim  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction.”).  By rescinding the OMB Memo, the Government has voluntarily provided the \nprospective injunctive relief that Plaintiffs sought in their Complaint.  See Compl. at 18-19 \n(seeking injunctive relief as to the OMB “Memo”).  To the extent Plaintiffs claim to suffer from a \nrevived version of the OMB Memo during the pendency of this action, they can file another motion \nfor preliminary relief.  At present, however, it is wholly speculative to claim that emergency relief \nis necessary to avert harms associated with an agency action that has already been rescinded.  Thus, \neven if the voluntary rescission of the challenged OMB Memo does not moot the entire case, it \nsurely moots Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief. \nB.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Seek Prospective Relief \nEven if Plaintiffs’ claims were not moot, their claims fail—and their motion for preliminary \ninjunction must be denied—because they still have not established “injury in fact” that was “fairly \n. . . traceable to the challenged action” and “redress[able] by a favorable decision” even before the \nOMB Memo was rescinded.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). \n-11- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 15 of 49\n \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs cannot claim injury-in-fact based on funding streams that \nwere not included within the OMB Memo’s temporary pause.  The OMB Memo itself expressly \ntied the pause to activities “that may be implicated by the executive orders.”  OMB Memo at 1.  \nAnd even if there were some ambiguity, the OMB Guidance—issued the very next day, before the \ntemporary pause’s effective date—made explicit that “[a]ny program not implicated by the \nPresident’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause.”  OMB Guidance at 1.  At the TRO \nhearing, Plaintiffs stated that none of their members’ funding implicates any of the Executive \nOrders.  See TRO Hrg. Tr. at 51 (“It’s hard, actually, to think of one of the declarants that we \nprovided whose funding does have an obvious connection to any of the EOs.”).  If that is correct, \nPlaintiffs’  alleged  injuries  do  not  stem  from  the  OMB  Memo  itself,  but  rather  (at  most) \nimplementation decisions by agencies who are not named as defendants. \nNor can Plaintiffs establish injury through their conclusory statement that the OMB \nMemo’s “threat to core rights of speech and association protected by the First Amendment \nconstitutes irreparable harm all on its own.”  PI Mot. at 31, 35.  Even for First Amendment claims, \n“in order to have standing, an individual must present more than allegations of a subjective chill.  \nThere must be a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  \nBigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 816-17 (1975).  And here, Plaintiffs nowhere identify the \nspecific expressive activity for which they claim they are being penalized, or how the OMB \nMemo’s pause as to certain grants involving certain policies operates as a threat of harm to them \nspecifically.  Indeed, their actual feared harm appears to be a loss of future federal funding—i.e., \nthat “their future receipt of federal financial assistance depends on the content and viewpoint of \ntheir speech,” PI Mot. at 35—which is not only premature prior to any decision on future funding, \nbut also would not be redressed by an order prohibiting a temporary pause in current funding. \n-12- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 16 of 49\n \nEven if Plaintiffs had an injury, Plaintiffs still have not proven that such injuries were \ncaused by the OMB Memo as opposed to unchallenged actions by non-defendant agencies.  The \nnow-rescinded OMB Memo did not itself temporarily pause any federal financial assistance.  \nRather, the OMB Memo merely instructed federal agencies to temporarily pause certain federal \nfinancial assistance programs “to the extent permissible under applicable law.”  OMB Memo at 2.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the OMB Memo did not “leave it to agency discretion to decide what \nto pause.”  PI Mot. at 13.  But the OMB Memo on its face does not determine which funds or \ngrants should be paused; it requires that agencies make that determination, consistent with their \nown  authorities.    Because  the  OMB  Memo’s  instruction  was  conditional  on  each  agency’s \ndetermination that they had discretion to pause particular funding, any pause in funding is not \n“fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant” but rather is “th[e] result [of] the \nindependent action of some third party not before the court.”  Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560; \nsee also Louisiana v. Biden, 64 F.4th 674, 681-84 (5th Cir. 2023) (holding that States lacked \nstanding to challenge Executive Order because the Order “d[id] not require any action from federal \nagencies,” in part because “[a]gencies must exercise discretion in . . . deciding to use the Interim \nEstimates as ‘appropriate and consistent with applicable law,’” and thus any harms “are traceable \nto possible agency actions, not to the [executive order] or the Interim Estimates”). \nPlaintiffs contend that causation must exist because certain “funds began flowing again” \nfollowing entry of this court’s temporary restraining order.  PI Mot. at 33 n.10.  But that could \nequally be because such funds were not intended to be paused under the OMB Memo and OMB \nGuidance, or because of a broader court order entered by a district court in Rhode Island (extending \nbeyond just the OMB Memo challenged in this case).  See New York et al. v. Trump et al., No. 25-\ncv-39 (JJM), ECF Nos. 50, 96 (D.R.I. Feb. 3, 2025).  Thus, the resumption of funding does not \n-13- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 17 of 49\n \nprove causation specific to the challenged OMB Memo. \nFinally, Plaintiffs cannot establish redressability because their funding is not administered \nby OMB, but instead by Federal agencies that are not parties to this lawsuit who “would not be \nbound” by any injunction in this case.  Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023).  Regardless \nof any injunction that could be entered here, those Federal agencies would remain free to pause \nPlaintiffs’ funding pursuant to their own discretion.  Thus, “an injunction” against the OMB Memo \n“would not give [Plaintiffs] legally enforceable protection from the allegedly imminent harm.”  Id. \nUltimately, to establish standing, Plaintiffs must clearly articulate specific funds that (1) are \nwithin the scope of the OMB Memo’s pause, (2) remain at risk of being paused because of that \nMemo as opposed to some other independent agency action or Executive Order not challenged in \nthis case, and (3) would necessarily be unpaused (or remain unpaused) if this Court entered \npreliminary relief directed at the OMB Memo.  Plaintiffs have not made that showing here, \nespecially as they fail to address standing.  Accordingly, even apart from mootness, Plaintiffs also \nlack standing to obtain prospective preliminary relief.  \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS FAIL AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO \nAMORPHOUS FOR RESOLUTION \nBeyond just failing to address jurisdiction, Plaintiffs’ PI motion fails to address another \nfundamental defect in their claims, which is that they are simply too amorphous for resolution in \nthe absence of concrete factual contexts. \nA.  The OMB Memo Is Not a Discrete, Final Agency Action \nThe APA permits review only over “final agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, which must also \nbe “circumscribed [and] discrete.” Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA), 542 U.S. \n55, 62 (2004).  The APA does not provide for “general judicial review of [an agency’s] day-to-day-\noperations,” Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 899 (1999). \n-14- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 18 of 49\n \nHere, the OMB Memo is not a final agency action because, as discussed, the OMB Memo \nitself did not determine that any particular grants should be paused.  Any effect on Plaintiffs \nnecessarily required a subsequent agency to decide to actually suspend Plaintiffs’ funding, which \nmeans the OMB Memo itself was not a final agency action subject to direct challenge.  See, e.g., \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992) (“The core question is whether the agency \nhas completed its decisionmaking process, and whether the result of that process is one that will \ndirectly affect the parties.”); DRG Funding Corp. v. Sec’y of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 76 F.3d 1212, \n1214 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“[C]ourts have defined a nonfinal agency order as one, for instance, that \ndoes not itself adversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency \nof future administrative action.” (quotation marks omitted)). \nEven apart from final agency action, however, Plaintiffs’ APA claims fail for an even more \nstraightforward reason: even assuming Plaintiffs could challenge the OMB Memo based on its \nsupposedly  determinative  impact  on  numerous  funding  streams,  that  is  an  amorphous \nprogrammatic challenge—not a challenge to a discrete agency action as required under the APA. \n“Under the terms of the APA, respondent must direct its attack against some particular ‘agency \naction’ that causes it harm.”  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 891.  Perhaps the APA would allow \nindividual grant recipients to challenge specific withholdings of funds under a particular grant.  \nBut that is not what Plaintiffs seek in this suit; they are not bringing claims, for example, based \nonly on a pause of funding under specific programs affecting their specific Plaintiffs.  Instead, they \nclaim to seek relief on behalf of “tens of thousands of members” potentially affected by the “many, \nmany grant programs across the country.”  Tr. of Jan. 28 Hrg. at 6.   \nSuch amorphous, generalized claims—untethered to specific decisions in the context of \nindividual grant programs—are indistinguishable from the type of broad, programmatic challenges \n-15- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 19 of 49\n \nthe Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit have rejected.  See Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 890; Am. \nForest Res. Council v. United States, 77 F.4th 787, 805 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (rejecting a “blunderbuss \nchallenge” in which the plaintiffs “complain not that the Secretary failed to take a specific action \nbut rather that she failed to carry out the . . . Act’s general directives”); Fund for Animals, Inc. v. \nBureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 21 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nThese principles are not limited to situations where a private party seeks to compel \ncompliance with a broad statutory mandate.  Rather, these principles reflect a concern about \nensuring courts maintain a limited role in APA litigation.  Plaintiffs here are essentially arguing \nthat, for every single grant involving them or their members, OMB (and non-defendant agencies) \nhave  unlawfully  failed  to  disburse  their  funding.    Providing  relief  on  such  a  claim  would \nnecessarily require “pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency \ncompliance” with countless appropriations laws, which is simply “not contemplated by the APA.”  \nSUWA, 542 U.S. at 67.  As Plaintiffs’ ongoing compliance accusations reflect, see PI Mot. at 8-9 \n& nn.4-6, this Court cannot resolve their broad claims without risking becoming an overseer of a \nwide swath of the Executive Branch’s ongoing funding activities.  This inability to fashion tailored \nrelief highlights the fundamental defect in Plaintiffs’ impermissibly broad APA claims. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Arbitrary and Capricious and First Amendment Claims Are Not \nRipe \nSimilar to the above defect, Plaintiffs’ claims are highly amorphous at this stage.  Plaintiffs \nare particular grantees with individual factual circumstances, but they seek expansive relief that \nwould disable OMB from taking similar action as to any grantee.  Their claims are too amorphous \nand not ripe at this stage to support such broad requested relief. \n“The ripeness doctrine favors postponement of review when a court believes that it would \nbe better able to decide the case in the concrete factual context of a specific application of the \n-16- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 20 of 49\n \nchallenged agency decision.”  Consolidation Coal Co. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Review \nComm’n, 824 F.2d 1071, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is true even when an agency’s policy is sure \nto cause the plaintiff’s claimed injury.  See Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. \n289, 300 (1979).  And even if the injury is alleged to have already occurred, the claim still must \narise in a sufficiently concrete factual context to allow for judicial resolution.  See State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co. v. Dole, 802 F.2d 474, 484 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“Although we agree that the Secretary’s \nalleged violation (as New York sees it) of the Safety Act has already occurred, this issue is still \nunfit for review because it has not yet arisen in a sufficiently concrete setting.”). \nHere,  two  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  necessarily  require  fact-specific  analysis.    First,  in \nconnection with their arbitrary and capricious claim, Plaintiffs are essentially bringing a facial \nchallenge—arguing that the OMB Memo is necessarily irrational as to every single federal grantee.  \nSee, e.g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 300-01 (1993) (“[T]his is a facial challenge to INS \nregulation 242.24. Respondents do not challenge its application in a particular instance; it had not \nyet been applied in a particular instance . . . and it had been in effect only a week when the District \nCourt issued the judgment invalidating it. . . .  To prevail in such a facial challenge, respondents \n‘must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the [regulation] would be valid.’”); \nAm. Hosp. Ass’n v. N.L.R.B., 499 U.S. 606, 619 (1991) (“The fact that petitioner can point to a \nhypothetical case in which the rule might lead to an arbitrary result does not render the rule \n‘arbitrary or capricious.’ This case is a challenge to the validity of the entire rule in all its \napplications.”); Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 397 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  But there are undoubtedly \nsome grants for which the temporary pause was lawful, including grants where the pause was less \nthan a day.  See OMB Guidance at 1 (“A pause could be as short as [a] day.  In fact, OMB has \nworked with agencies and has already approved many programs to continue even before the pause \n-17- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 21 of 49\n \nhas gone into effect.”). \nIn its prior Order, the Court concluded that the OMB Memo was irrational in part because \n“Defendants’ actions appear to suffer from infirmities of a constitutional magnitude,” in particular \nunder “[t]he Appropriations Clause of the Constitution [which] gives Congress ‘exclusive power’ \nover federal spending,” because “OMB ordered a nationwide freeze on pre-existing financial \ncommitments without considering any of the specifics of the individual loans, grants, or funds.”  \nTRO Op. & Order at 25-26.  Plaintiffs here do not bring any claims under the Appropriations \nClause, and aside from their claim about OMB’s underlying authority, they do not contend that the \nOMB Memo violated particular statutes or appropriations measures.  See Compl. ¶¶ 44-61.  This \nCourt should not expand Plaintiffs’ claims beyond what they have chosen to plead in their \nComplaint.  See, e.g., Pac. Radiation Oncology, LLC v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 810 F.3d 631, 633 (9th \nCir. 2015) (“A court’s equitable power lies only over the merits of the case or controversy before \nit.  When a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief based on claims not pled in the complaint, the court \ndoes not have the authority to issue an injunction.”). \nIn any event, even if these considerations were appropriate, they only underscore the \nabstract and unripe nature of Plaintiffs’ challenge.  The relevant question would be whether, for \neach particular grant program, a temporary pause violates the underlying statutory authorities, \nappropriations measures, or other regulations governing the grant.  See In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d \n255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“[T]he President may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or \nprohibition simply because of policy objections.”); City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 \nF.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018) (“[T]he Executive Branch may not refuse to disperse the federal \ngrants  in  question  without  congressional  authorization.”  (emphasis  added)).   As  Plaintiffs \nacknowledge,  however,  grant  programs  “operate  pursuant  to  a  wide  array  of  statutory \n-18- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 22 of 49\n \nauthorizations and appropriations,” and “[t]he agencies that administer those programs in turn have \npromulgated their own governing regulations[.]”  PI Mot. at 23.  This Court cannot conduct such \nanalysis in the abstract, untethered from those underlying statutory authorities, appropriations \nmeasures, and grant regulations.  Even Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that, for many grant \nprograms, the Executive has significant discretion over selecting recipients and deciding whether \nto continue funding them.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has previously held that allocations from a \nlump-sum appropriation provide such significant discretion to the Executive that such decisions \nare not susceptible to judicial review.  See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993) (“The \nallocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is another administrative decision traditionally \nregarded as committed to agency discretion.”).  Thus, to the extent the Court is considering whether \nthe OMB Memo’s pause is consistent with Congressional directions to disburse funding—a claim \nthat Plaintiffs have not presented in this case—the claim is plainly not ripe because it is too abstract \nfor resolution at this stage, unmoored from any specific grant or program. \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim likewise requires evaluation in more concrete \nsettings.  A necessary predicate for a First Amendment claim is that a grantee must be engaging in \nexpressive activity.  See U.S. Telecom Ass’n v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 825 F.3d 674, 741 (D.C. \nCir. 2016) (“The Supreme Court has explained that the First Amendment comes ‘into play’ only \nwhere ‘particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements,’ that is, when an “intent \nto convey a particularized message is present, and in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood \nis great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.” (cleaned up)).  That is \nnecessarily a fact-specific inquiry that cannot be generalized across all recipients of federal funding \nto conclude that they, too, believe the OMB Memo stifles their expressive conduct and are entitled \nto relief.  Such a claim requires more granular analysis, inconsistent with the broad, amorphous \n-19- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 23 of 49\n \nattack that Plaintiffs bring against the OMB Memo.2  \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE MERITLESS ON THEIR OWN TERMS \nEven if the Court were willing to review Plaintiffs’ claims on the merits, the Executive \nBranch’s actions here were lawful.  It is well established that, to effectuate his discretion and policy \nobjectives, the President may direct agencies to take actions to pause funding pursuant to the \nauthority those agencies possess under their organic statutes and regulations.  Plaintiffs do not take \nissue with that legal proposition, which should end the matter because that is all the OMB Memo \nsought to accomplish. \nPlaintiffs’ claims all rest on a serious misreading of the OMB Memo, both in terms of its \nscope and instructions to agencies.  Properly understood, the OMB Memo amply satisfies the \nstandard for arbitrary and capricious review under the APA.  And the OMB Memo fits comfortably \nwithin the statutory authorities vested in OMB, as well as the First Amendment’s constraints.  \nThus, none of Plaintiffs’ claims warrants the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction. \nA.  All of Plaintiffs’ Claims Rest on an Incorrect Reading of the OMB Memo \nPlaintiffs’ claims in this case all rest on a flawed premise—that the OMB Memo instructed \nagencies to pause all forms of federal financial assistance, without regard to the underlying legal \nframework governing such funding.  But this characterization is incorrect in two respects:  the \nOMB Memo’s temporary pause was not across the board, and the OMB Memo expressly instructed \nagencies to implement a pause only to the extent permissible by law.  This critical language in both \n \n2 Defendants understand Plaintiffs’ statutory claim to be solely about the question whether \nOMB has “authority to issue . . . a government-wide halt on trillions of dollars in grants, loans, \nand other forms of financial assistance.”  PI Mot. at 21.  That statutory question on its own does \nnot raise ripeness concerns.  But to the extent Plaintiffs’ claim is broader—and seeks to disable \nOMB from ever advising agencies to implement temporary pauses on particular funding to the \nextent permissible by law, cf. infra Part V—that broader claim would raise ripeness concerns \nbecause Plaintiffs would essentially be asking this Court to issue an advisory opinion on the full \nparameters of OMB’s authority. \n-20- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 24 of 49\n \nthe OMB Memo and the OMB Guidance cannot simply be ignored. \nPlaintiffs continue to frame this case as being about whether the Executive Branch can \ncategorically pause all funding without consideration of whether a pause is consistent with the \nunderlying legal framework governing that funding.  See, e.g., PI Mot. at 16 (“The Order . . . \ncommands a near immediate freeze on all obligations and disbursements of essentially all federal \nfinancial assistance.”).  But that interpretation is contrary to the OMB Memo’s plain text.  First, \nthe OMB Memo’s temporary pause was expressly connected to the President’s Executive Orders: \nTo implement these orders, each agency must complete a comprehensive analysis \nof all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects, \nand activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders.  In \nthe interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies must \ntemporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal \nfinancial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by \nthe executive orders[.] \nOMB Memo at 2 (emphases added, bold text omitted).  Second, as that language also reflects, \nagencies were instructed to implement that pause only “to the extent permissible under applicable \nlaw.”  Id.  The OMB Memo elsewhere reiterated that the temporary pause is about the President’s \nExecutive Orders and should be implemented only consistent with law:  “This temporary pause \nwill provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of \nthe funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities.”  Id. \n(emphasis added).  The OMB Memo acknowledged six times that agencies should act “consistent \nwith the law,” i.e., that agencies should not contravene their statutory authorities.  Id.   \nConsistent with the OMB Memo, the OMB Guidance—issued the very next day—further \nemphasizes both these points.  Its bolded text states upfront that “[a]ny program not implicated by \nthe President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause.”  OMB Guidance at 1.  And it later \nemphasizes  that  “the  pause  does  not  apply  across-the-board,”  and  “is  expressly  limited  to \nprograms, projects, and activities implicated by the President’s Executive Orders.”  Id.  Similarly, \n-21- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 25 of 49\n \nthe Guidance makes clear that the pause applies only to the extent permissible by law.  See, e.g., \nOMB Guidance at 1 (“OMB issued guidance requesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the \nextent permitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by \nthe President’s Executive Orders.”); id. (“Any payment required by law to be paid will be paid \nwithout interruption or delay.”); id. at 2 (“It is a temporary pause to give agencies time to ensure \nthat financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive Orders, to the \nextent permitted by law.”).   \nPlaintiffs’ claims ignore all of these provisions.  Indeed, their PI motion entirely ignores \nthe existence of the OMB Guidance.  There is no valid basis for simply ignoring an official agency \npronouncement of what the challenged agency policy means.  That pronouncement was issued one \nday after the challenged action, divorced from the context of this litigation, and has all the same \nhallmarks of being an official statement from the agency regarding its policy.  Particularly in the \ncontext of a motion seeking emergency, prospective relief, Plaintiffs cannot simply ignore an \nofficial pronouncement about the action that is the object of Plaintiffs’ challenge.  Cf. Nat’l \nTreasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 661 n.1 (1989) (“We therefore consider the \nHHS  Regulations  to  the  extent  they  supplement  or  displace  the  Commissioner’s  original \ndirective.”). \nMoreover, even Plaintiffs do not dispute that the OMB Memo itself instructed agencies to \npause funding only “to the extent permissible under applicable law.”  As previously discussed, the \nD.C. Circuit has recognized that such language has meaningful effect.  See Bldg. & Const. Trades \nDep't, AFL-CIO v. Allbaugh, 295 F.3d 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (upholding Executive Order as \nproper “exercise of the President’s supervisory authority over the Executive Branch” including \nbecause “the President directs his subordinates how to proceed in administering federally funded \n-22- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 26 of 49\n \nprojects, but only ‘[t]o the extent permitted by law,’” and thus “if the agency is prohibited, by \nstatute or other law, from implementing the Executive Order, then the Executive Order itself \ninstructs the agency to follow the law”); Common Cause v. Trump, 506 F. Supp. 3d 39, 47 (D.D.C. \n2020) (Katsas, J.) (“We cannot ignore these repeated and unambiguous qualifiers imposing \nlawfulness and feasibility constraints on implementing the memorandum.”). \nPlaintiffs now seek to distinguish Allbaugh on the basis that the OMB Memo’s “directive \nto halt essentially all federal financial assistance within 24 hours can hardly be compared to a \npolicy found to fall well within ‘the ordinary course of administration.’”  PI Mot. at 14 (quoting \nAllbaugh, 295 F.3d at 33).  But that argument simply begs the question—by portraying the OMB \nMemo in the broadest possible terms, assuming that agencies will not give effect to the very \nprovision under discussion, and wholly ignoring what OMB itself said was the actual scope of the \npolicy.  This is not a situation, therefore, where a savings clause “would override clear and specific \nlanguage” in the challenged policy.  City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1239 (cited in PI \nMot. at 14-15).  To the contrary, the challenged policy here is replete with references to agencies \nacting only consistent with law.  Thus, Plaintiffs cannot continue attacking an interpretation of the \nOMB Memo—as constituting an across-the-board freeze of all federal financial assistance—that \nOMB itself has expressly disavowed (and rescinded).  That is the definition of inviting this Court \nto issue an advisory opinion with no prospective effect.   \nAt a minimum, the challenged OMB Memo is capable of being construed as directing only \na pause in funding for programs implicated by the President’s Executive Orders, and directing only \nthose funding pauses that agencies have concluded are lawful.  This Court should construe the \nchallenged policies to preserve their legality, just as it would for any other type of action.  Cf. \nArizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 415 (2012) (“inappropriate to assume” that state enactment \n-23- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 27 of 49\n \nwill be construed in an impermissible manner); Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (per \ncuriam) (presumption that statutes should be construed to be lawful); Restatement (Second) of \nContracts § 203(a) (same for contracts).   \nPlaintiffs also dispute the “to the extent permissible by law” language by contending that \n“agencies had no practical ability to give effect” to that provision.  PI Mot. at 14.  As an initial \nmatter, the OMB Memo’s pause implicated only those funds related to the President’s Executive \nOrders, most of which had been issued a week prior to the OMB Memo on January 20, 2025.  And \nPlaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that courts get to decide how much time the President \nmust afford agencies before directing them to act.  Indeed, it would be a fundamental intrusion on \nArticle II for courts to require the President to wait a particular amount of time before directing \nagencies to implement his agenda to the extent permissible by law.  \nIn any event, the dispute over whether the OMB Memo provided sufficient time for \nagencies to determine the legality of particular funding pauses is largely academic at this stage.  \nThe OMB Memo was withdrawn weeks ago, and the sole question before this Court is whether it \nshould enter emergency, preliminary relief prohibiting the Executive from implementing other \nfunding pauses to the extent permissible by law.  Agencies have by now had more time to analyze \nthe Executive Orders and the various funding programs they administer, and would have even \nmore opportunity to do so in light of any subsequent directive that might ultimately be issued.  \nThere is plainly no basis for preliminary relief now, based on Allbaugh and other longstanding \ndecisions recognizing the President’s legitimate authority to direct subordinate agencies’ activities, \nas consistent with law.  See Allbaugh, 295 F.3d at 32 (“[T]he President’s power necessarily \nencompasses  ‘general  administrative  control  of  those  executing  the  laws,’  throughout  the \nExecutive Branch of government, of which he is the head.” (quoting Myers v. United States, 272 \n-24- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 28 of 49\n \nU.S. 52, 164 (1926), citation omitted)); Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n(“[A]s an agency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s \npolicy directives to the extent permitted by law.”); Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 406 n.524 \n(D.C. Cir. 1981) (“The ordinary duties of officers prescribed by statute come under the general \nadministrative control of the President by virtue of the general grant to him of the executive power, \nand he may properly supervise and guide their construction of the statutes under which they \nact[.]”).  At the absolute most, Plaintiffs’ argument would justify an injunction against OMB \ndirectives that provide “24 hours . . . to shut off perhaps trillions of dollars in federal funding,” PI \nMot. at 14, but cannot justify extending relief to the permissible exercise of Executive Branch \nauthority that Allbaugh and the OMB Memo plainly comprehend. \nAt bottom, Plaintiffs’ claims are premised on portraying the OMB Memo in the broadest \npossible terms—applying to all funding, regardless of that funding’s own legal framework—which \nis contrary to the Memo’s own text and the subsequent Guidance that was issued.  Properly \nunderstood, the Memo was lawful and far more modest than Plaintiffs portray. \nB.  The OMB Memo Was Not Arbitrary and Capricious \nThis Court previously concluded that “Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed \non the merits of their arbitrary and capricious claim.”  TRO Op. & Order at 26.  The Court should \nreach a different conclusion at this stage. \nAs a threshold matter, even if Plaintiffs’ speculation is correct that some version of the \nOMB Memo might be reinstated in the future, their arbitrary-and-capricious challenge to the \nreasoning in this particular OMB Memo is moot.  Any new memorandum would be premised on \nnew considerations and would not present the same legal issue as the one presented here, so a \ndecision by this Court about the propriety of OMB’s past analysis would be a pure advisory \nopinion.  See Noem v. Haaland, 41 F.4th 1013, 1016-17 (8th Cir. 2022) (finding arbitrary-and-\n-25- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 29 of 49\n \ncapricious claim challenging past event moot because “the circumstances [in the future] are likely \nto be different” and noting that “[i]n arbitrary-and-capricious review, even small factual differences \ncan matter”); cf. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1908 \n(2020) (when an agency chooses to “‘deal with the problem afresh’ by taking new agency action,” \nthe agency “is not limited to its prior reasons”).  Success on an arbitrary-and-capricious claim \ncannot foreclose the agency from taking new action based on new reasoning, see infra Part V, and \nthus success on this particular claim would not justify Plaintiffs’ broad relief against both the OMB \nMemo and potential future versions of the OMB Memo. \nRegardless, there is nothing irrational about a temporary pause in funding, to the extent \npermissible by law, pending a review to ensure compliance with the President’s priorities.  That is \nprecisely what OMB and other subordinate agencies are legally required to do pursuant to the \nPresident’s Executive Orders.  See supra Part III.A; Sherley, 689 F.3d at 784 (“[A]s an agency \nunder the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s policy directives to \nthe extent permitted by law.”).  It cannot be irrational for agencies, including OMB, to comply \nwith the law in such a manner.  Indeed, requiring a federal agency to articulate a rationale for its \naction—beyond simple compliance with the President’s directives—would, in essence, subject the \nPresident’s directive to arbitrary and capricious review, contrary to the principle that the President \nis not an agency under the APA.  Franklin, 505 U.S. at 800-01; see also Dalton v. Specter, 511 \nU.S. 462, 475-76 (1994); Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot., 801 F. \nSupp. 2d 383, 403 (D. Md. 2011) (“the State Department and Assistant Secretary were acting on \nbehalf of the President, and therefore their actions are not reviewable under the APA”), aff’d, 698 \nF.3d 171 (4th Cir. 2012). \nThe OMB Memo was also rational on its own terms.  The scope of review under the \n-26- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 30 of 49\n \n“arbitrary and capricious” standard, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), is “narrow and a court is not to \nsubstitute its judgment for that of the agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  This standard “deems the agency action presumptively valid \nprovided the action meets a minimum rationality standard.” Sierra Club v. EPA, 353 F.3d 976, 978 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).   \nThe bulk of Plaintiffs’ argument, as well as this Court’s prior analysis, is based on the OMB \nMemo constituting “a near immediate freeze on all obligations and disbursements of essentially \nall federal financial assistance.”  PI Mot. at 16; see also TRO Op. & Order at 26 (“OMB ordered \na  nationwide  freeze  on  pre-existing  financial  commitments  without  considering  any  of  the \nspecifics of the individual loans, grants, or funds.”).  As discussed above, however, the reality is \nfar more modest—agencies were instructed to pause discrete categories of funding, to the extent \ndoing so is consistent with their underlying statutory authorities, to ensure that such funding aligns \nwith a new Administration’s priorities.  This is not, as the Court characterized it, “a blank check \nfor OMB to do as it pleases.”  TRO Op. & Order at 23.  At every juncture, the Memo emphasized \nthat all actions must be taken within the confines of existing law. See OMB Memo at 1-2 \n(cautioning six times that any pause must be in accordance with law).  And as the OMB Guidance \nmakes clear, the pause was only to affect certain discrete funding streams implicated by the \nPresident’s Executive Orders, excluding “mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP” as well \nas “[f]unds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other \nsimilar programs.”  OMB Guidance at 1-2.  Thus, Plaintiffs cannot invoke those very programs to \nimpugn the Memo’s rationality.  See PI Mot. at 16. \nAdditionally, the OMB Memo cogently explains that its objective is to effectuate the \nPresident’s Executive Orders and “safeguard valuable taxpayer resources.”  OMB Memo at 1.  The \n-27- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 31 of 49\n \nOMB Memo rationally connected the temporary pause with these objectives by explaining that it \nis necessary to “provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the \nbest uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities.”  \nOMB Memo at 2.  Plaintiffs and the Court have posited that the Executive could have made a \ndifferent choice to review programs without pausing funding.  See TRO Op. & Order at 24; PI \nMot. at 18.  But the question is whether the agency engaged in reasoned decisionmaking, not \n“whether a regulatory decision is the best one possible or even whether it is better than the \nalternatives.”  FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 577 U.S. 260, 292 (2016).  And the suggested \nalternative overlooks the obvious problem that resources are finite, and any funds that are \ndisbursed are unlikely to ever be recouped and thus cannot be redirected and put to more valuable \nuses.  Cf. 2 C.F.R. § 200.346 (procedures for collecting debts).  Weighing the costs of a temporary \npause in funding, versus the potential benefits of being able to redirect that limited funding to \npurposes that the Administration believes will better serve the public, is a judgment entrusted to \nthe Executive and not the courts.  Cf. Off. of Commc’n of United Church of Christ v. FCC, 707 \nF.2d 1413, 1437 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“When the Commission reaches such predictive conclusions \nabout what would best be in the public interest, it is entitled to substantial judicial deference.”). \nThe unavoidable consequence of Plaintiffs’ argument is that the Executive cannot pause \nfunding pending a review, and must instead wait a certain amount of time before implementing its \npriorities.  By that logic, it was irrational for agencies (at President Biden’s instruction) to “pause \nwork” and “pause immediately the obligation of funds related to construction of the southern \nborder wall, to the extent permitted by law,” for at least 60 days pending a review and development \nof a new plan for that funding.  Procl. No. 10,142, Termination of Emergency With Respect to the \nSouthern  Border  of  the  United  States  and  Redirection  of  Funds  Diverted  to  Border  Wall \n-28- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 32 of 49\n \nConstruction, 86 Fed. Reg. 7225 (Jan. 20, 2021), §§ 1(a)(i)-(ii), 2; see also id. § 1(a) (directing \nOMB to assist in implementing pauses).  Similarly, it was irrational for agencies to implement \nPresident Obama’s direction to “delay funding of the project for 30 days” with respect to certain \nRecovery  Act  funding  to  “ensure  adequate  opportunity  for  public  scrutiny  of  the  project.”  \nEnsuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, 74 Fed. Reg. 12,531 (Mar. 20, 2009), \n§ 2(d)(i); see also id. (directing agencies to implement delays in consultation with OMB). \nPlaintiffs cannot brush away these historic precedents as only “involv[ing] targeted pauses \nto specific programs,” PI Mot. at 25, because the OMB Memo here likewise targeted only discrete \ntypes of funding implicated by the President’s Executive Orders.  And in any event, that distinction \njust underscores the degree to which Plaintiffs are asking this Court to impose arbitrary timetables \non the Executive based on the Court’s own weighing of the relative merit of the “specific \nprograms” at issue in the pause—i.e., that it was permissible for President Biden on the first day \nof his Administration to immediately pause $1.375 billion in FY 2021 funding (and more from \nprior years’ funding) associated with the southern border wall, but is nonetheless arbitrary for this \nAdministration to likewise pause certain types of funding.  Cf. Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act, 2021, Pub L. No. 116-260, div. F, § 210, 134 Stat. 1182, 1456-57 (Dec. 27, \n2020) (appropriating $1.375 billion “for the construction of barrier system along the southwest \nborder”).  This Court should not open the door for arbitrary-and-capricious claims against agencies \nthat implement the President’s priorities through temporary pauses in funding. \nAdditionally, contrary to Plaintiffs’ arguments, see PI Mot. at 16-17, the OMB Memo did \nconsider real-world consequences associated with the pause—and in fact took steps to mitigate \nthem.  First, recognizing potential consequences for individuals, the OMB Memo exempted \n“assistance provided directly to individuals,” specifically mentioning “Medicare or social security \n-29- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 33 of 49\n \nbenefits.”  OMB Memo at 1 nn.1-2; see also OMB Guidance at 1-2.  Second, the OMB Memo \nrecognized that, despite the need for a pause and review of certain assistance, there may be some \nparticular circumstances warranting a different approach, and thus provided for a safety valve \nthrough “case-by-case” exceptions to the Memo.  OMB Memo at 2.  Plaintiffs may dispute the \nusefulness of said safety valve, see PI Mot. at 21, but reasonable minds can disagree about the \n“best” approach; the agency is required only to make a reasonable choice.  See State Farm 463 \nU.S. at 43 (“a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency”).  Third, the OMB \nMemo was explicit that it directed only a temporary pause and review, not anything more \nsignificant such as outright cancellation of any grants.  And fourth, the OMB Memo provided a \ndelayed effective date, with OMB acting quickly even before that effective date to “approve[] \nmany programs to continue even before the pause has gone into effect.”  OMB Guidance at 1.  \nThose efforts do not reflect wholesale disregard of real-world consequences, but rather an attempt \nto balance those consequences with the stated objectives of “act[ing] as faithful stewards of \ntaxpayer money” and ensuring that federal programs “are being executed in accordance with the \nlaw and the new President’s policies.” Id. at 2. \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that OMB failed to account for reliance interests.  See PI Mot. \nat 19.  But, in addition to addressing reliance interests through the above safeguards, the OMB \nMemo leaves discretion to agencies to consider any reliance issues that would be relevant to a \ndecision about a specific federal grant—that is part of the agencies’ duty to ensure they act in \naccordance with applicable law.   \nIn short, there is nothing irrational about the OMB Memo’s temporary pause on certain \nforms of assistance, to the extent permissible by law, pending a review to ensure consistency with \nthe President’s Executive Orders, as OMB (and individual agencies) are required to do. Sherley, \n-30- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 34 of 49\n \n689 F.3d at 784.  A temporary pause in funding, accompanied by multiple safeguards, is a rational \nstep toward achieving the best uses of taxpayer money as evaluated by the Executive; therefore \nthe OMB Memo was not arbitrary and capricious.   \nC.  OMB Has Ample Statutory Authority to Advise Agencies to Pause Funds \nPlaintiffs argue that OMB “lack[s] statutory authority to issue . . . a government-wide halt \non trillions of dollars in grants, loans, and other forms of financial assistance.”  PI Mot. at 21.  \nAgain, their arguments are largely tied to their mischaracterization of the OMB Memo itself.  See \nsupra Part III.A.  In any event, Plaintiffs take an unduly cramped view of OMB’s authority. \nAt the outset, Plaintiffs’ argument should be viewed skeptically given the longstanding \nrecognition of OMB’s central role in the Executive Branch.  See, e.g., Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Off. of \nMgmt. & Budget, 598 F.3d 865, 867 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“The Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB), located in the Executive Office of the President . . . , helps the President prepare the \nfederal budget and ensures that legislation, testimony, reports, and policies prepared by other \nfederal agencies are consistent with Administration policy.”); Meyer v. Bush, 981 F.2d 1288, 1294 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (“[T]he OMB Director, whose duties include aiding the President in managing \nthe entire executive branch, is . . . the cabinet officer functionally, if not actually, closest to the \nPresident.”).  Indeed, it would be a startling proposition that the Office of Management and Budget \ncannot advise agencies on managing their budgets.   \nPlaintiffs largely argue that “command[ing] a full stop of essentially all federal financial \nassistance” is outside OMB’s authorities set forth in 31 U.S.C. § 503.  But that statute is not the \nonly one under which OMB is vested with authority.  OMB also has responsibility over budget \nexecution, including the responsibility to apportion funds as OMB “considers appropriate.”  31 \nU.S.C. § 1512(b)(2).  As the Fourth Circuit has explained, this provision “vest[s] the decision as \nto the frequency of payments in an executive officer,” specifically “the Director of OMB.”  \n-31- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 35 of 49\n \nMaryland Dep’t of Hum. Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 854 F.2d 40, 42 (4th Cir. 1988); \nsee also id. n.* (tracing the history of this provision’s delegation to OMB).  To be clear, OMB did \nnot exercise its apportionment authority in connection with the challenged OMB Memo and the \ntemporary pause, which is yet another example of why OMB did not itself determine the legal \nrights or consequences of any particular funding stream.  For purposes of Plaintiffs’ statutory \nclaim, however, the relevant point is that if OMB had authority to implement the pause through \napportionment, then surely it likewise had authority to implement the pause through the less-\ncoercive form of a general memorandum.  Cf. Am. Hosp. Ass’n v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1052 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (“In this area, the greater surely includes the lesser: that is, the greater authority \nof an agency to review all hospital activity includes the lesser authority to train its reviewing \nresources on a subset of that activity likely to include a heavier dose of abuse.”). \nIn any event, even considering only 31 U.S.C. § 503, Plaintiffs’ claim still falls flat.  OMB \nis directed to “monitor the financial execution of the budget in relation to actual expenditures, \nincluding timely performance reports,” 31 U.S.C. § 503(a)(5), which necessarily implies an \noversight function in connection with “actual expenditures.”  The OMB Memo’s instruction to \ntemporarily pause “actual expenditures” to allow for a review of “the financial execution of the \nbudget” in connection with the President’s priorities easily falls within this provision.   \nMoreover, OMB is directed to “[p]rovide overall direction and leadership to the executive \nbranch on financial management matters by establishing financial management policies and \nrequirements[.]”  Id. § 503(a)(2).  Those functions are carried out by the Office of Federal Financial \nManagement (subject to the OMB Deputy Director’s control), see id. § 504(a), and those functions \nare intertwined with overseeing proper expenditures of the Government’s funds.  The Office of \nFederal Financial Management was created by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Pub. L. \n-32- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 36 of 49\n \nNo. 101-576, 104 Stat. 2838 (Nov. 15, 1990), in which Congress made findings that: \n(1) General management functions of the Office of Management and Budget need \nto be significantly enhanced to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nFederal Government. \n(2) Financial management functions of the Office of Management and Budget need \nto be significantly enhanced to provide overall direction and leadership in the \ndevelopment of a modern Federal financial management structure and associated \nsystems. \n(3)  Billions  of  dollars  are  lost  each  year  through  fraud,  waste,  abuse,  and \nmismanagement among the hundreds of programs in the Federal Government. \n(4)  These  losses  could  be  significantly  decreased  by  improved  management, \nincluding  improved  central  coordination  of  internal  controls  and  financial \naccounting. \nPub. L. No. 101-576, § 102(a).  Congress plainly understood OMB’s increased role to include \n“central coordination of internal controls” and “provid[ing] overall direction and leadership,” to \nhelp  avoid  further  losses  “through  fraud,  waste,  abuse,  and  mismanagement.”    Id.    That \nunderstanding  of  financial  management  is  precisely  what  the  OMB  Memo  reflects,  as \nimplementing a temporary pause “to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the \nfunding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities,” and thereby \n“increase the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar.”  OMB Memo at 1-2. \nPlaintiffs’ contrary theory—that OMB has no role to play in implementing such reviews \nand improvements—would disable OMB from acting under all Administrations to ensure the best \nuses of taxpayer dollars, contrary to the examples cited above involving Presidents Biden and \nObama.    And  Plaintiffs’  reliance  on  other  federal  laws  governing  grant  programs  and \nappropriations, see PI Mot. at 23, is irrelevant given that the OMB Memo expressly instructs \nagencies to comply with those laws in implementing the pause.  Nor does the short-term, temporary \npause announced in the OMB Memo bear any resemblance to the “mass debt cancellation \nprogram” in Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2375 (2023).  See PI Mot. at 24.  Given that the \n-33- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 37 of 49\n \nOMB Memo itself tells agencies to implement the pause consistent with applicable law—in other \nwords, consistent with congressional intent—there is no reason to assume that the ability to \ntemporarily pause funding (where legally permissible) is a power “that Congress would likely have \nintended for itself.”  Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2375. \nIn sum, particularly now that the OMB Memo has been withdrawn, that memorandum \nshould not result in a judicial ruling that disables OMB from performing its functions on behalf of \nall Presidential Administrations.  In any case, OMB had authority to issue the challenged Memo. \nD.  Plaintiffs’ First Amendment Claims Are Meritless Because the Government \nMay Choose Which Programs It Intends to Subsidize \nIt is well-established that “[t]he Government can, without violating the Constitution, \nselectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, \nwithout at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in \nanother way.  In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has \nmerely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.”  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, \n193 (1991).  That straightforward principle forecloses Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim. \nPlaintiffs try to circumvent Rust by asserting that the OMB Memo is instead stifling their \nexpressive activity outside just the grant programs receiving federal funding.  See PI Mot. at 26 \n(“[I]t is clear what will happen to recipients of federal financial assistance whose speech or \nassociations somehow connect them to these disfavored ideas: Their funding will cease.”). But \nPlaintiffs point to nothing in the OMB Memo reflecting an intent to penalize mere association with \n“disfavored ideas,” except the very thing the Government is undisputedly allowed to do which is \ndefine the types of programs that the Administration does (and does not) wish to fund. \nPlaintiffs continue to invoke U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev. (USAID) v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, \nInc.,  570  U.S.  205  (2013),  but  that  case  involved  a  policy  “mandat[ing]  that  recipients  of \n-34- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 38 of 49\n \nLeadership Act funds explicitly agree with the Government’s policy to oppose prostitution and sex \ntrafficking.”  Id. at 213.  Thus, it directly governed speech beyond just the confines of the activity \nbeing funded.  Here, the OMB Memo’s directives are framed solely around “focusing taxpayer \ndollars” and “[t]he use of federal resources.”  OMB Memo at 1. \nPlaintiffs argue that the OMB Memo’s definition of what activities should be funded are \n“ill-defined concepts.”  PI Mot. at 29.  But each of the relevant concepts is addressed in more detail \nin the President’s Executive Orders.  And in any event, using general terms (in general guidance), \nwhile deferring to agencies to conduct the specific reviews of their programs, hardly justifies an \ninference that OMB is targeting “political views or associations” rather than programs receiving \nfederal funding.  Id.  Plaintiffs also contend that they must be targeted because, having already \nreceived awards, they have “already . . . established that they are engaged in the activities that \nCongress meant to subsidize.”  Id.  But that argument ignores the significant discretion afforded \nto agencies across numerous funding programs to choose, within the parameters set by Congress, \nexactly which programs to fund.  See generally Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192-94.  Simply because a \ngrantee receives an award at the outset does not preclude the agency from later determining that \nthe award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), \nlet alone suggest that any such termination must necessarily be because of a grantee’s political \nviews or associations.  Plaintiffs’ objection to the tone of the OMB Memo also does not establish \nan impermissible purpose.  PI Mot. at 29; cf. Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, \nInc., 576 U.S. 200, 207 (2015) (“When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech \nClause from determining the content of what it says.”). \nAt the TRO hearing, Plaintiffs argued that they were being targeted because one of the \nExecutive Orders “tell[s] agencies to report to OMB the names of federal grantees who received \n-35- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 39 of 49\n \nfederal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA or environmental justice programs in the past,” \nwhich they say is “irrelevant to . . . determining what activities are going to be subsidized in the \nfuture.”  TRO Hrg. Tr. at 56-57.  But that theory of purported harm stems from an Executive Order \nnot challenged in this suit, and has nothing to do with the validity of the OMB Memo’s temporary \npause.  In any event, that section of the Executive Order is about winding down any ongoing \nprograms  involving  policies  about  which  the  new Administration  has  concerns;  identifying \ngrantees that have received funds for those programs is a logical way to ensure that any ongoing \nprograms are terminated.  See Exec. Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical And Wasteful Government \nDEI Programs And Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025), § 2(b)(ii)(C). \nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the pre-requisite for any First Amendment claim is that a \nparticular grantee is engaged in expressive conduct.  That is necessarily an individualized showing, \nand many of the declarants do not even purport to be concerned about the OMB Memo’s effect on \ntheir expressive activities.  Compare, e.g., TRO Hrg. Tr. at 26 (identifying Exhibit F as an example \nof someone “wonder[ing] will my funds ever be unfrozen, will I be associated in some way with \nthese incredibly general targets described in the memo: Green new deal, wokeness, gender \nideology,  Marxist  equity”),  with  Pls.’  Exh. F  (ECF  No. 24-6)  ¶¶ 3-24  (not  identifying  any \nexpressive activity associated with their research or concerns about expressive activity).  Even if \nthere were a cognizable First Amendment claim, then, it could not support the broad relief that \nPlaintiffs seek here.  But more fundamentally, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment theory is foreclosed by \nRust v. Sullivan and the principle that the Government need not fund programs to which it objects. \nIV.  THE BALANCE OF THE EQUITIES INDEPENDENTLY FORECLOSES RELIEF  \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Not Proven Irreparable Injury in the Absence of a Preliminary \nInjunction \nIn this Circuit, there is a “high standard for irreparable injury.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \n-36- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 40 of 49\n \nChurches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Any alleged irreparable harm “must be \nboth certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”  Id.  It also must be of such \n“imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.”  Id. (citing Wisc. Gas Co. v. \nFERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)) (emphasis in original).  Plaintiffs’ motion \ncan be denied solely on the basis that they have failed to demonstrate irreparable injury.  See id. \n(“A movant’s failure to show any irreparable harm is therefore grounds for refusing to issue a \npreliminary injunction, even if the other three factors entering the calculus merit such relief.” \n(citing Sea Containers Ltd. v. Stena AB, 890 F.2d 1205, 1210–11 (D.C. Cir. 1989))). \nAs already discussed, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, and, in any event, Plaintiffs never \nsufficiently alleged injury to satisfy the requirements of Article III standing.  See supra Section I.  \nIt therefore follows that Plaintiffs have failed to show irreparable injury for similar reasons.   \nMoreover, in order to demonstrate irreparable harm, Plaintiffs must show “that the alleged \nharm will directly result from the action which the movant seeks to enjoin.”  Wis. Gas Co., 758 \nF.2d at 674; see also California v. Trump, 379 F. Supp. 3d 928, 959 n.21 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (in order \nto show irreparable harm “Plaintiffs must demonstrate some likely harm resulting from the \nchallenged action” (emphasis added)).  Therefore, as previously explained in the context of \nmootness, Plaintiffs’ assertions that they will experience harms stemming from a potential future \nfunding pause cannot establish irreparable harm in this suit, which challenges only the rescinded \nOMB Memo.  \nIndeed, it is wholly speculative that Plaintiffs would experience any injury in the absence \nof preliminary relief.  Plaintiffs admit that their declarants and other Plaintiff members are \ncurrently “able to draw on open awards,” PI Mot. at 9, so any alleged irreparable harm must be \nbased on speculative future events that might change the status quo.  But Plaintiffs do not provide \n-37- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 41 of 49\n \nanything more than speculation that, absent preliminary relief, the OMB Memo would be reissued, \nnor do they establish that their grant programs would fall within any such reconstituted OMB \nMemo.  See OMB Memo at 1 n.1 (exempting “assistance received directly by individuals” from \nany pause); OMB Guidance at 1-2 (stating that the OMB Memo did not apply to “[a]ny program \nnot implicated by the President’s Executive Orders”).  Instead, Plaintiffs simply aver that they \nwould be harmed by a future funding freeze.  See ECF No. 40-1 ¶ 4; ECF No. 40-2 ¶ 8; ECF \nNo. 40-3 ¶ 5; ECF No. 40-4 ¶ 17; ECF No. 40-5 ¶ 8; ECF No. 40-6 ¶ 11; ECF No. 40-7 ¶ 9.  Absent \nproof that the OMB Memo would be reissued in the absence of preliminary relief and that it would \npause funding to the relevant programs, Plaintiffs cannot show irreparable harm that is “both \ncertain and great” and “actual and not theoretical.”  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297. \nPlaintiffs’ citation to League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1 (D.C. \nCir.  2016)  is  inapposite.    In  that  case,  the  plaintiffs—which  included  several  voting-rights \norganizations  and  two  Kansas  residents—challenged  decisions  by  the  Election  Assistance \nCommission to include a proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federally prescribed national \nmail voter registration form in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Kansas.  See id. at 3.  The court \nruled that voting-rights organizations in Alabama and Georgia had demonstrated irreparable harm, \neven though it was “unclear whether Alabama and Georgia [were] currently enforcing their proof-\nof-citizenship laws.”  Id. at 8.  The court reasoned that “based on the experience of the Kansas \n[voting-rights plaintiff], it seems almost certain that similar obstacles to registration will spring up \nin Alabama and Georgia when those States decide to enforce their laws.”  Id.  Thus, unlike here, \nNewby involved a threat of prospective harm arising from clearly defined agency action that was \nstill in place.  While it may not be speculative to assume that Alabama and Georgia would “decide \nto enforce their laws” and that any harms would be similar to those evidenced in another state, id. \n-38- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 42 of 49\n \nat 8, it is certainly speculative to assume that in the absence of a preliminary injunction the OMB \nMemo would be both reissued and applicable to Plaintiffs’ identified programs.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that their alleged First Amendment injury “constitutes its own form \nof irreparable harm.”  PI Mot. at 35.  To begin with, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim is meritless, \nsee supra Section III.D, so it cannot be the basis for a finding of irreparable harm.  In any event, \nPlaintiffs must “do more than allege a violation of freedom of expression in order to satisfy the \nirreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction frame-work.”  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 301.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs “must also establish they are or will be engaging in constitutionally \nprotected behavior to demonstrate that the allegedly impermissible government action would chill \nallowable individual conduct.”  Id.  Plaintiffs fail this test because, as previously explained, they \ndo not identify specific expressive activity for which they claim they are being or will be penalized, \nnor do they explain how the OMB Memo’s pause of certain funding operates to harm their First \nAmendment rights specifically.  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ theory of constitutional harm does not vitiate \nthe requirement that the alleged irreparable harm must directly result from the challenged action.  \nSee id. (plaintiffs must demonstrate that “the allegedly impermissible government action would \nchill allowable individual conduct”); see also California v. Trump, 379 F. Supp. 3d at 959 n.21 \n(even under a constitutional-harm theory, “Plaintiffs must demonstrate some likely harm resulting \nfrom the challenged action, and not simply a constitutional violation”).  And since the challenged \nOMB Memo has been rescinded, any alleged ongoing or prospective harm to Plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment rights would be caused by independent action not challenged in this suit, and therefore \ncannot provide the basis for irreparable harm on this preliminary-injunction motion. \nB.  The Public Interest Weighs Squarely Against Relief \nLastly,  the  balance  of  equities  and  the  public  interest  weigh  against  granting  the \nextraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs argue that “[t]he government has no \n-39- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 43 of 49\n \nlegitimate interest in carrying out an unlawful action.”  PI Mot. at 36.  But that is just a repackaged \nversion of their merits arguments, and same with irreparable harm, see id.  Again, Plaintiffs fail to \nidentify a causal link between any alleged future harms to the public and “[i]mplementation of \nMemo M-25-13,” id., which has been rescinded and in any event did not apply to many of the \nprograms Plaintiffs identify, compare id. at 36 (alleging “nationwide disruption” in the absence of \npreliminary relief, affecting “the provision of vital services from health care to subsidized meals \nfor the elderly to emergency relief to children’s Head Start programs”); with OMB Guidance at 1 \n(“Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause.”); \nid. at 1–2 (listing categories of funding that “will not be paused,” including “[a]ny program that \nprovides direct benefits to individuals” as well as “mandatory programs,” and “[f]unds for small \nbusinesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs”). \nMeanwhile, contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertions that Defendants will not suffer harm if a \npreliminary  injunction  is  granted,  an  injunction  here  would  effectively  disable  OMB  from \nimplementing  the  President’s  priorities  consistent  with  its  legal  authorities.    “Any  time  a \n[government] is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its \npeople, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) \n(Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (brackets omitted).  Additionally, where the Government is legally \nentitled to make decisions about the disbursement or allocation of federal funds but is nonetheless \nordered to release the funding, such funds may not be retrievable afterwards.   \nPlaintiffs here seek exceptionally broad relief, not limited to remedying the alleged harms \nthey suffer and not seeking to invalidate only the specific portions of the challenged OMB Memo \nthat they allege are unlawful.  See ECF No. 40-8 at 1 (asking the Court to enjoin Defendants from \n“implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the directives in OMB \n-40- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 44 of 49\n \nMemorandum M-25-13”).  Given the breadth of that requested relief, the harms to the Government \nwould be tremendous.  A broad preliminary injunction would have a significant chilling effect on \nthe  President’s  and  his  advisors’  ability  to  lawfully  direct  and  guide  agencies’  spending \ndecisions—contrary to the will of the people as expressed through the President and his priorities.  \nIndeed, agencies may feel obligated to forgo pursuing legally permissible actions in furtherance of \nthe President’s operative Executive Orders or other policy priorities for fear of risking contempt.  \nThus, the balance of equities weighs in favor of the Government and relief should be denied. \nV.  ANY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHOULD BE LIMITED AND STAYED \nIt is a bedrock principle of equity that “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.” Califano v. Yamasaki, \n442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).  Additionally, “‘preliminary relief may never be granted that addresses \nmatters ‘which in no circumstances can be dealt with in any final injunction that may be entered.’”  \nIn re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig, 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting De Beers Consol. \nMines v. United States, 325 U.S. 212, 220 (1945)).  Therefore, the scope of equitable relief \navailable here should be constrained by what would be available to Plaintiffs at final judgment \nunder the APA.  See Pac. Radiation Oncology, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 810 F.3d 631, \n636 (9th Cir. 2015) (preliminary relief must be “of the same nature as that to be finally granted.”). \nRelief under the APA is limited; courts may either “compel agency action unlawfully \nwithheld or unreasonably delayed” or “hold unlawful and set aside agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 706; \nsee also SUWA 542 U.S. at 66-67 (explaining how the APA’s limits on relief are intended to \n“protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion, and to avoid \njudicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements”).  Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim does not \nalter the scope of relief that is available to them in this APA case, as review still occurs under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(B) for being “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  Cf. \n-41- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 45 of 49\n \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327-28 (2015) (“Courts of equity can no \nmore disregard statutory and constitutional requirements and provisions than can courts of law.”).  \nThus, if the Court is inclined to grant Plaintiffs’ motion, it must do so consistent with the \nAPA.  Any relief should be narrowly tailored to apply only to Plaintiffs, to the object of their \nchallenge (the OMB Memo), and to leave intact the Executive Branch’s discretion to engage in \nfurther consideration of the topic at hand and implement new policies consistent with law.  \nA.  Injunctive Relief Should Be Limited to the Present Plaintiffs and the Object of \nTheir Challenge: The OMB Memo  \nAny preliminary relief should be limited to addressing any established harms of the present \nPlaintiffs that stem from the OMB Memo.  There is no basis for extending relief to non-parties in \nthis suit, or to funding streams that do not appear to have any effect on Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, \nany preliminary injunction should confirm that all obligations in the injunctive order apply only \nwith respect to awards involving the identified Plaintiffs.  See Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. \n390, 395 (1981) (“The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” (emphasis added)).  \nFurthermore, it is axiomatic that Plaintiffs are not entitled to emergency injunctive relief \nreaching beyond the scope of what they challenge in this case.  See, e.g., Bird v. Barr, No. 19-cv-\n1581, 2020 WL 4219784, at *2 (D.D.C. July 23, 2020) (a preliminary injunction “is not a generic \nmeans by which a plaintiff can obtain auxiliary forms of relief that may be helpful to them while \nthey litigate unrelated claims”).  Plaintiffs cannot possibly challenge future iterations of the OMB \nMemo that do not yet exist, and thus any relief should be limited to the OMB Memo. \nB.  Relief Should Be Limited to Preserve the Executive Branch’s Discretionary \nAuthority \nTo the extent the Court considers Plaintiffs’ proposed preliminary injunction, that order \nshould also be limited to mitigate (albeit not eliminate) the significant harms it would cause to \n-42- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 46 of 49\n \nDefendants’ and the Executive Branch’s abilities to exercise their lawful authority and discretion.  \nSpecifically, the Court should decline to enjoin Defendants from implementing, giving effect to, \nor reinstating under a different name the OMB Memo.  Foreclosing further executive action on the \nmatter would be contrary to the limited relief available under the APA, which generally allows \ncourts to invalidate only the specific portions of an agency policy that it finds unlawful.  Cf. \nCarlson v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, 351 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (“The APA permits a court \nto sever a rule by setting aside only the offending parts of the rule.”).  And this particular aspect of \nrelief is especially vague as to how OMB is supposed to determine whether a subsequent action is \nequivalent to “reinstating under a different name” the OMB Memo at issue in this case.  \nIf  the  Court  concludes  it  is  likely  that  certain  provisions  of  the  OMB  Memo  were \nsubstantively contrary to law, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), any injunction that flows from that determination \nmust be specific as to the provisions OMB is enjoined from reissuing.  See City of N.Y. v. Mickalis \nPawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 145 (2d Cir. 2011) (“An injunction is overbroad when it seeks to \nrestrain the defendants from engaging in legal conduct, or from engaging in illegal conduct that \nwas not fairly the subject of litigation.”).  The injunction must “state its terms specifically,” and \n“describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or other document—the act \nor acts restrained or required.”  Fed R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C).  When granting equitable relief under \nthe APA, “ordinarily the appropriate course is simply to identify a legal error and then remand to \nthe agency” for further action consistent with that determination.  N. Air Cargo v. U.S. Postal Serv., \n674 F.3d 852, 861 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).   \nWhen there is a finding of arbitrary and capricious action, then “further consideration of \nthe issue by the agency” is the required remedy.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 46 (1983).  But an overbroad preliminary injunction like \n-43- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 47 of 49\n \nthe one Plaintiffs request would prohibit the agency from engaging in “further consideration.”  Id.; \ncf. Pub. Emps. for Env’t Resp. v. Nat’l Park Serv., 605 F. Supp. 3d 28, 49 (D.D.C. 2022) (declining \nto “preclude an agency from reaching a similar result on the same issue of substantive policy, as \nlong as the second decision result[s] from a new procedural process distinct enough that it can \nfairly be considered a new ‘action’”).   \n  By requesting the exact opposite of the remedy that is typically available under the APA, \nPlaintiffs’ proposed injunction also runs counter to the rule that “‘preliminary relief may never be \ngranted that addresses matters ‘which in no circumstances can be dealt with in any final injunction \nthat may be entered.’”  In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig, 333 F.3d at 525 (quoting De Beers \nConsol. Mines, 325 U.S. at 220).  To avoid this, any preliminary relief here should make clear that \nit does not prohibit OMB from issuing new policies effectuating the President’s priorities.  Failure \nto include that clarification would only highlight the intrusive nature of Plaintiffs’ requested \ninjunction, prohibiting OMB from assisting the President in implementing his agenda.  Cf. Sherley, \n689 F.3d at 784 (“an agency under the direction of the executive branch . . . must implement the \nPresident’s policy directives to the extent permitted by law”).  \nDefendants respectfully request that any preliminary relief be narrowly tailored to preserve \nthe Executive Branch’s authority as a coordinate branch of government to further consider the \nissues at hand and act upon those considerations pursuant to proper procedures and the Court’s \nidentification of specific legal constraints.  That is the normal remedy in APA litigation, and \nanything broader would constitute a significant intrusion on the separation of powers. \nAdditionally, to the extent the Court enters injunctive relief, the Court should also order a \nbond consistent with the mandatory language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  Although the D.C. Circuit \nhas allowed courts to dispense with a bond in certain circumstances, Fed. Prescription Serv., Inc. \n-44- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 47     Filed 02/15/25     Page 48 of 49\n \nv. Am. Pharm. Ass’n, 636 F.2d 755, 759 (D.C. Cir. 1980), injunctive relief here would cause \n“material damage” to the Executive by instructing agencies not to pause disbursements on grants \nthat they may ultimately wish to terminate or award to a different recipient.  And particularly given \nthat several of the Plaintiffs here are associations (not direct grant recipients), it is difficult to see \nhow the Government could recoup any funding from those associations in the event the injunction \nis overturned.  The Court should therefore order at least the Plaintiff associations to post a bond \ncommensurate with the scope of relief ordered, i.e., with a lesser amount required to the extent the \nCourt awards relief only for the identified members’ funding, as opposed to all grant recipients. \nFinally, in light of the extraordinary breadth of Plaintiffs’ requested relief, to the extent the \nCourt issues any injunctive relief, the United States respectfully requests that such relief be stayed \npending the disposition of any appeal that is authorized, or at a minimum that such relief be \nadministratively stayed for a period of seven days to allow the United States to seek an emergency, \nexpedited stay from the court of appeals if an appeal is authorized. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction should be denied.  \n \nDated: February 15, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n          BRETT A.

In practice, the Memo purports to eradicate essentially all \nfederal grant, loan, and other financial assistance programs.  Acting Director Vaeth’s only \nstated basis for doing so is his belief that “[f]inancial assistance should be dedicated to \nadvancing Administration priorities,” and that “[t]he use of Federal resources to advance \nMarxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste \nof taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve.”  Id. at 1. \nThis memo—made public only through journalists’ reporting, with barely twenty-\nfour hours’ notice, devoid of any legal basis or the barest rationale—will have a devastating \nimpact on thousands of grant and subgrant recipients who depend on the inflow of grant \nmoney (money already obligated, awarded, and funding ongoing work) to fulfill their \nmissions, pay their employees, pay their rent—and, indeed, improve the day-to-day lives \nof the many people they work so hard to serve. \n \n1 A copy of the Memo is available online at: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/deb7af80-48b6-4b8a-8bfa-\n3d84fd7c3ec8.pdf. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 3 of 17\n \n \nAlthough the Trump Administration is at liberty to “advanc[e] [its] priorities,” id., \nit must do so within the confines of the law.  It has not.  The Memo fails to explain the \nsource of OMB’s purported legal authority to gut every grant program in the federal \ngovernment; it fails to consider the reliance interest of the many grant recipients, including \nthose to whom money had already been promised; and it announces a policy of targeting \ngrant recipients based on those recipients’ exercise of their First Amendment rights and for \nreasons having no bearing on their eligibility to receive federal funds.   \nGiven the few hours that remain before federal grantees, loan recipients, and \ncountless others are thrown into disarray, a temporary restraining order is critical to \nmaintain the status quo until the Court has an opportunity to more fully consider the \nillegality of OMB’s actions. \nBACKGROUND \n  On  January  27,  2025,  Matthew  J.  Vaeth,  Acting  Director  of  the  Office  of \nManagement and Budget, issued Memo M-25-13, titled “Temporary Pause of Agency \nGrant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs.” The Memo directs each federal \nagency to “complete a comprehensive analysis of all of their Federal financial assistance \nprograms to identify programs, projects, and activities that may be implicated by any of \nthe President’s executive orders.” Id. at 2. \nThe category of “Federal financial assistance programs” covered by the memo is \nsweeping. Id. at 1 n.1. It includes all “[a]ssistance that recipients or subrecipients receive \nor administer in the form of” federal grants, loans, loan guarantees, and insurance, among \nother things (but not Medicare or Social Security benefits). See 2 C.F.R. 200.1.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 4 of 17\n \n \nThe Memo provides that all agencies must cease “all activities related to obligation \nor disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that \nmay  be  implicated  by  the  executive  orders,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  financial \nassistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, \nand the green new deal.” Memo at 2. The sweep of the executive orders referenced is \nstaggering, from all “equity”-related grants, to all foreign aid, to funding appropriated \nthrough the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and \nbeyond. See id. at 1-2. The Memo orders that this “pause” will take effect on January 28, \n2025 at 5:00 p.m. Id. at 2. It does not provide an end date for the pause. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  To obtain a temporary restraining order, “the moving party must show: (1) a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if \nthe [temporary restraining order] were not granted; (3) that [such an order] would not \nsubstantially injure other interested parties; and (4) that the public interest would be \nfurthered” by the order.  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, \n297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations omitted); see also Hall v. Johnson, 559 F. Supp. 2d 1, 3 n.2 \n(“[T]he same standard applies to both temporary restraining orders and to preliminary \ninjunctions.” (citation omitted)).  “When the movant seeks to enjoin the government, the \nfinal two TRO factors—balancing the equities and the public interest—merge.”  D.A.M. v. \nBarr, 474 F. Supp. 3d 45, 67 (citing Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016)). \nCourts in this Circuit continue to apply a “sliding scale” approach, wherein “a \nstrong showing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.”  Changji \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 5 of 17\n \n \nEsquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted) (noting potential tension in case law but reserving the question \nof “whether the sliding-scale approach remains valid”); National Railroad Passenger \nCorp. (Amtrak) v. Sublease Interest Obtained Pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption \nof Leasehold Interest Made as of Jan. 25, 2007, Case. No. 22-1043 (2024 WL 34443596, \nat *1-2 (D.D.C. July 15, 2024) (recognizing that district courts remain bound by sliding-\nscale precedent). \nARGUMENT \n  All three factors favor Plaintiffs here. OMB has likely violated the Administrative \nProcedure  Act  through  its  cursory  reasoning,  which  fails  to  acknowledge  the  deep \ndetrimental impact that will likely result from the Memo’s precipitous enactment, is not \nauthorized by law, and is contrary to the Constitution.  As a result, the Memo purports that \nPlaintiffs will immediately lose access to promised funding, throwing their own finances \nand operations into havoc.  And the public has no interest in a violation of the law.  A \ntemporary restraining order should issue to prevent Plaintiffs from suffering these harms \nuntil this Court has the opportunity to further consider the case. \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \nThe Memo is replete with APA violations: it is in excess of OMB’s statutory \nauthority,  it  is  arbitrary  and  capricious,  and  it  is  contrary  to  law,  namely  the  First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to prevail on \nthe merits of their claim. \nAs an initial matter, the Memo constitutes final agency action and is thus subject to \nreview by this Court. Final agency actions are those (1) that “mark the consummation of \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 6 of 17\n \n \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997) (quotation marks omitted). The OMB Memo meets both prongs of this test. It \nconclusively directs the immediate suspension of the obligation or disbursement of all \nfederal financial assistance, aside from some limited carveouts, as of 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, \nJanuary 28, 2025—a move that will likely have legal consequences for thousands (and \nlikely far more) of grant recipients, including Plaintiffs, who have built business plans, \nmade hiring decisions, and set organizational priorities based on an understanding that they \nwould receive the grants that the federal government awarded them.  The Memo is thus \nsusceptible to review under the APA, through which a court shall “hold unlawful and set \naside agency action . . . found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).    \nThe Memo is in excess of OMB’s statutory authority. That authority permits it to \nprovide “overall direction and leadership,” “review agency budget requests for financial \nmanagement  systems  and  operations,”  “oversee,  periodically  review,  and  make \nrecommendations  to  heads  of  agencies,”  “provide  advice  to  agency  heads,”  “settle \ndifferences  that  arise  among  agencies  regarding  the  implementation  of  financial \nmanagement policies,” and “communicate with” State and local governments and “foster \nthe exchange . . . of information concerning financial management standards, techniques, \nand processes.” 31 U.S.C. § 503(a). That authority does not, however, extend so far as to \nallow OMB to unilaterally, without notice or process, purport to effectively stop all grant \nprograms across the entire federal government via a two-page Memo. Indeed, OMB \nacknowledges the limitations of its authority to direct federal financial management, as its \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 7 of 17\n \n \nown Grants Guidance specifies that agencies must take independent action to implement \nthat Guidance via rules and regulations, 2 C.F.R. § 200.106—a position wholly at odds \nwith this Memo, which itself renders null and void federal grant programs government-\nwide. \nThe Memo is also arbitrary and capricious.  Under arbitrary-and-capricious review, \n“the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \naction including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “Normally, an agency rule would be \narbitrary and capricious if the agency . . . entirely failed to consider an important aspect of \nthe problem . . . or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or \nthe product of agency expertise.”  Id.  In considering an agency’s action, the reviewing \ncourt “may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has \nnot given.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nHere, the Memo fails to articulate any reasoning that could support OMB’s decision \nto purport to unilaterally halt all grant programs across the federal government without \nnotice.  At best, it employs some empty platitudes about “a stronger and safer America,” \n“eliminating the financial burden of inflation for citizens,” and “Making America Healthy \nAgain,” while “ensur[ing] that Federal funds are used to support hardworking American \nfamilies.”  M-25-13 at 1-2.  But the Memo does not discuss how halting all federal grant \nprograms without notice will accomplish any of those goals.  Nor could it, in a mere two \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 8 of 17\n \n \npages, have explained how halting grants for cancer research2 will make America stronger \nand healthier, or how halting grants that support fiscal education3 will reduce financial \nburdens; or how gutting the fiscal stability of grant recipients4 will support the hardworking \nAmerican families employed by them.   \nThe Memo makes no attempt to quantify, or even articulate, the catastrophic \npractical  consequences  that  will  follow  from  immediately  halting  all  federal  grant \nprograms:  to understate it, “an important aspect of the problem,” 463 U.S. at 43; see also \nDickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1404 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (explaining that “[t]he \nrequirement that agency action not be arbitrary and capricious includes a requirement that \nthe agency adequately explain its result” and holding invalid agency action where agency \n“failed to provide anything approaching a reasoned explanation for its decisions”).  Nor \ndoes the Memo explain why it failed to provide meaningful notice to grant recipients of an \nimpending pause (so that they could plan accordingly), nor explain the urgency that seems \nto motivate the agency action. \n \n2 See “Apply for Cancer Control Grants,” National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer \nControl  and  Population  Sciences,  available  at \nhttps://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/funding/funding-opportunities (last viewed Jan. 28, 2025) \n(“The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences funds a large portfolio of grants \nand contracts. The portfolio currently includes over 700 grants, valued at over $500 \nmillion.”). \n3 As of July 2019, the Department of Treasury estimated that the federal government spent \n$273 million each year on financial literacy and education programs and activities. See \n“Federal  Financial  Literacy  Reform:  Coordinating  and  Improving  Financial  Literacy \nEfforts,”  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  available  at \nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611168.pdf (last viewed Jan. 28, 2025). \n4 To  illustrate the breadth of the Memo’s effect: according to GAO, federal grants \ncomprised approximately 19 percent of total federal spending in Fiscal Year 2022. Federal \ngrant  spending  to  tribal,  state,  local,  and  territorial  governments  alone  totaled \napproximately $1.2 trillion. “Grants Management: HHS Has Taken Steps to Modernize \nGovernment-wide Grants Management,” Government Accountability Office, available at \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106008 (last viewed Jan. 28, 2025). \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 9 of 17\n \n \nMoreover, the Memo utterly fails to account for the significant reliance interests \nthat attach to grant recipients.  “When an agency changes course, as [OMB] did here, it \nmust  be  cognizant  that  longstanding  policies  may  have  engendered  serious  reliance \ninterests that must be taken into account.”  Dep’t of Homeland Security v. Regents of the \nUniv. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Here, the \nreliance interests are as obvious as they are serious: a grant recipient that has already been \nawarded a grant, and that reasonably expects grant disbursements on a certain timetable, \nhas organized its organizational priorities, its spending, its hiring, and the obligations it has \nmade to clients and creditors accordingly.  Pulling the rug out from under an organization \nthat this same federal government already deemed worthy of funding is not only cruel, it \nis obtuse and unreasoned.  Whatever the new administration’s feelings about the policy \npriorities of its predecessors, it does not have carte blanche to ignore the consequences of \nthose prior agency actions. \nThe Memo’s purported limitation of “to the extent permissible under applicable \nlaw,” M-25-13 at 2, does not render it any less unlawful. Applicable law for federal \nfinancial assistance is complex, with specific terms and requirements that vary across grant \nprograms and individual awards. Such an assessment is simply impossible to do across all \nfederal financial assistance programs accurately and completely within the twenty-four \nhours permitted for implementation. This clause cannot save the Memo, but instead \nreinforces its wholesale lack of reasoning. \nPlaintiffs are also likely to succeed on their claim that the Memo is unlawful and \nmust be set aside under the APA because it violates the First Amendment. Although the \nMemo purports to pause federal disbursements across the board, it makes clear that the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 10 of 17\n \n \nultimate purpose and objective of that pause is to identify and punish certain disfavored \nspeakers who, as the Memo describes it, “advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and \ngreen new deal social engineering policies,” M-25-13 at 1, or, in the words of the Executive \nOrder “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological \nTruth to the Federal Government” (January 20, 2025), the Memo cites, “promote gender \nideology.” The Memo does not disguise that it is an effort to punish certain recipients of \nfederal financial assistance based on their speech, political affiliation, and exercise of their \nright of association. \n“It is . . . a basic First Amendment principle that freedom of speech prohibits the \ngovernment from telling people what they must say.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open \nSoc'y Int'l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 213 (2013) (quotation marks omitted). This rule applies both \nto direct prohibitions on speech and to speech-related conditions imposed on benefits that \nwould otherwise be available. See id. at 214 (“[T]he Government ‘may not deny a benefit \nto a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech \neven if he has no entitlement to that benefit.’”) (quoting Rumsfeld v. F. for Acad. & \nInstitutional Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59 (2006)). In particular, the Supreme Court has made \nclear that conditions on federal funding “that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech \noutside the contours of the federal program itself”—that is, conditions that do more than \nsimply define the kinds of activities Congress wants to subsidize—are regulated by the \nFirst Amendment. Id. at 206. \nThe Memo seeks to leverage federal funding in just this way. It calls time on all \nfederal grant and loan disbursements and makes explicit that only recipients who adopt the \nTrump administration’s preferred position on charged political issues such as gender \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 11 of 17\n \n \nequality, trans rights, and environmental justice—or at least keep quiet their own contrary \nviews—can hope to receive federal funding again. Particularly given that the Memo \npurports to apply across the board to all federal grant programs, the government could not \npossibly hope to claim that its conditions on speech and association rights have any \nlegitimate relevance to grantees’ continued receipt of funds under specific federal grant \nprograms. And it is hard to imagine a more coercive means the government could employ \nto impose its preferred viewpoint on others than to hold hostage billions of dollars or more \nin federal funds. \nBecause the Memo’s conditioning of federal financial assistance on toeing the \ngovernment’s preferred line on matters of deep personal, moral, and political conviction \ndirectly implicates the First Amendment, and because it could not possibly satisfy strict \nscrutiny as a viewpoint-based restriction on core political speech, Plaintiffs are likely to \nprevail on the merits of this claim. See generally Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286, 293 (2024) \n(“As a general matter, a content-based regulation is presumptively unconstitutional and \nmay be justified only if the government proves that [it is] narrowly tailored to serve \ncompelling state interests.” (quotation marks omitted)). \nII.  Plaintiffs will suffer immediate, irreparable injury should the Memo take \neffect. \n \nShould the Memo’s purported halt to grant funding take effect at 5:00 p.m. today, \nPlaintiffs will be irreparably harmed.  “An irreparable harm is an imminent injury that is \nboth great and certain to occur, and for which legal remedies are inadequate.” Beattie v. \nBarnhart, 663 F. Supp. 2d 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2009). “Economic harm may constitute irreparable \ninjury . . . when the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’s business.” Air Transp. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 12 of 17\n \n \nAss’n of Am., Inc. v. Export-Import Bank of the U.S., 840 F. Supp. 2d 327, 336 (D.D.C. \n2012) (quotation omitted). \nAs to imminence and certainty of occurrence:  By its own terms, the Memo will be \neffective later today—within hours. This exigency is, of course, of OMB’s own creation: \nIt could have chosen an effective date that would have left adequate time for grant \nrecipients to plan, and for judicial review. But it did not.  \nThe harms that will take effect later today will be both significant and irreparable.  \nFirst, the Memo threatens immediate and irremediable constitutional harm by coercing \ngrant  and  loan  recipients’  exercise  of  their  First  Amendment  rights  of  speech  and \nassociation into conformity with the administration’s preferred views. “The loss of First \nAmendment freedoms,  for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury.” Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 19 (2020) \n(quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)); accord Pursuing \nAm.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \nSecond, as detailed in the accompanying declarations, Plaintiffs will also suffer \nconcrete, and indeed existential injuries to their mission, as entire programs will simply \ndisappear.  For example, SAGE’s new online hub, SAGEYou, is funded exclusively \nthrough federal appropriations. A funding cutoff jeopardizes multiple staff positions, \nSAGE’s ability to continue meeting its obligations to contractors which it has already \nretained, and, most importantly, will have a detrimental effect on the mental health and \noverall  well-being  of  millions  of  LGBTQ+  older  adults  across  the  United  States, \nparticularly those residing in rural and underserved areas who already face significant \nbarriers to accessing critical services and supports. See Tax Decl. (Ex. A) at ¶¶ 8-10. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 13 of 17\n \n \nThis is just one discrete example of the harm that will reverberate through every \nproject funded by the federal government.  Members of APHA, MSA, and NCN receive \nand otherwise directly benefit from federal financial assistance including grants and loans, \nand halting those expenditures will likewise halt the services they are able to provide in \ntheir communities, while risking their own financial viability. See Yentel Decl. (Ex. B) at \n¶¶ 8, 10-12, 15-17; Benjamin Decl. (Ex. C) ¶¶ 21-24; Phetteplace Decl. (Ex. D) at ¶¶ 3-5. \nAnd Plaintiffs likewise are harmed in their missions to promote equity, particularly because \nthe Memo seeks to chill expression of precisely that goal. \nAnother court in this district’s decision in Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Business \nAdministration is instructive. In that case, a restaurant owner applied for a grant from a \nfund established through the American Rescue Plan Act “to help restaurants and other \neligible businesses pay ‘expenses incurred as a direct result of, or during, the COVID-19 \npandemic.’” 646 F. Supp. 3d 101, 105 (D.D.C. 2022) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 9009c(c)(5)). \nThe Small Business Administration approved the grant, but prior to sending the award, the \nSBA notified the owner that recent court rulings precluded SBA from paying nearly 3,000 \napplicants—including the owner. Id. at 108. Meanwhile, the SBA continued paying other, \nunaffected grant applicants out of the fund. Id. \nUltimately, the restaurant owner filed suit against SBA for incorrectly interpreting \nthe relevant court rulings—and, accordingly, that declining to disburse his award was \narbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. Id. By the time the restaurant owner \nmoved for a temporary restraining order, only enough money remained to fund two final \napplicants. Id. at 109. In the time that it would take to reach a decision on the merits, the \nrestaurant owner argued, the last of the remaining grant funds would be gone. Id. at 115.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 14 of 17\n \n \nThis, the Court held, would be an irreparable injury. Id. at 115-16 (citing Nat’l Mining \nAss’n v. Jackson, 768 F. Supp. 2f 34, 52 (D.D.C. 2011) (“[I]f a movant seeking a \npreliminary injunction will be unable to sue to recover any monetary damages against’ a \ngovernment agency in the future because of, among other things, sovereign immunity, \nfinancial loss can constitute irreparable injury.”) (quotation omitted)). \nIf the injury to one restaurant in Chef Time was irreparable, so much more so an \nequivalent injury to every federal grantee. Untold grantee organizations—which, as of this \nfiling, are relying on grant funding that the federal government approved and awarded—\nmay shut their doors, and the essential services that they provide will go unprovided. \nIII.  The balance of equities and the public interest favor Plaintiffs. \n“It is well established that the Government cannot suffer harm from an injunction \nthat merely ends an unlawful practice.”  C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. \n2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Likewise, “[t]here is generally no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  Open Communities Alliance \nv. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017).  “To the contrary, there is a substantial \npublic interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws—such as the \nAPA, as well as regulations . . .—that govern their existence and operations.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  Thus, for the same reasons that Plaintiffs are likely \nto succeed on the merits, equity requires relief.   \nBut even if this Court were to balance the Government’s interests as if it were a \nprivate  party,  the  scales  tip  heavily towards  Plaintiffs:  in  one  pan,  the  Government \ncontinuing its regular expenditures of a relatively small portion of the federal budget that \nhas already been obligated, a routine practice that has not caused the Government injury \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 15 of 17\n \n \nyet in the months and years it has been doing so; in the other, Plaintiffs (and the many, \nmany grant recipients not currently before this Court) staring down imminent financial \nharm,  with  the  follow-on  consequences  to  their  employees,  landlords,  creditors, \nsubgrantees,  and  the  people  who  rely  on  their  services—without  the  privilege  the \ngovernment invokes of simply stopping payment without notice or consequence.  The \nMemo’s thin rationale of “advancing Administration priorities” cannot support a finding \notherwise. \nIV.  Relief  must  extend  to  all  recipients  of  federal  financial  assistance. \n \n  This Circuit’s precedents “hold that ‘[w]hen a reviewing court determines that \nagency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that \ntheir application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.’” D.C. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., \n444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 47 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). “The same reasoning has force in the \npreliminary injunction context.” Id. at 49 (collecting cases). “Nationwide preliminary \ninjunctive relief guarantees that a rule shown likely to be proven unlawful does not become \neffective, providing complete relief to the plaintiffs while the rule’s legality is finally \nadjudicated” and “ensur[ing] that complete relief remains available to the plaintiffs after \nthat final adjudication.” Id.; see also, e.g., Doe 2 v. Mattis, 344 F. Supp. 3d 16, 23 (D.D.C. \n2018) (“Plaintiffs were injured by a rule of broad applicability, so the Court acted properly \nin granting systemwide [preliminary] relief, even if that relief has the consequence of \nprotecting the rights of other [parties] individuals not before the Court.”). \n  There is no reason to depart from that default rule here. To the contrary, the \nunprecedented breadth, speed, and complexity of OMB’s action in freezing all federal \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 16 of 17\n \n \nfinancial assistance across the board and with just hours’ notice makes it all but impossible \nthat party-limited relief would be practicable in this case even if it were appropriate. \nMoreover, because the “nationwide impact” of the Memo ensures that it will “cause \ninjuries of sufficient similarity to the plaintiff[s’] to other states and individuals throughout \nthe country,” a nationwide remedy is appropriate. Id. at 51. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant their \nmotion and enter a temporary restraining order enjoining OMB and its Acting Director \nfrom implementing or enforcing Memo M-25-13 until further order of this Court. Plaintiffs \nalso request that the Court order Defendants to file a status report within twenty-four hours \nof the issuance of any temporary restraining order, and every two weeks thereafter for \ntwelve weeks, confirming the regular disbursement and obligation of federal financial \nassistance funds. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239     Document 5-1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 17 of 17\n \n \nDated: January 28, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Jessica Anne Morton \nJessica Anne Morton (DC Bar No. 1032316) \nKevin E.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 1 of 27\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \nNATIONAL COUNCIL OF   \nNONPROFITS, et al., \n    \nPlaintiffs, \n      Case No. 25-cv-239 \nv. \n    \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND \nBUDGET, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF  \nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nPlaintiffs have shown that a preliminary injunction is warranted. Unable to \nconfront that analysis head-on, Defendants focus on a sideshow of their own creation. \nRather than defend their actual Freeze Order, they imagine a different one and \ndefend that instead. Rather than addressing the authority of the actual defendants \nin  this  lawsuit,  they  discuss  the  President’s.  Unable  to  explain  the  continued \nimplementation of the Order even after its “rescission,” they suggest it was just a \ncoincidence, or agencies gone rogue. And unable to address the real and irreparable \nharm to thousands of grant and loan recipients who lost funding without notice and \nwere forced to shutter critical programs, Defendants imagine that they are the ones \nat risk of injury. The Court should conclude otherwise. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 2 of 27\nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. \nA. The Freeze Order commanded an immediate halt to nearly all \nfederal financial assistance. \n \nThe Freeze Order unambiguously told agencies to halt payment of “all” federal \nfinancial assistance (subject to limited exceptions). Defendants now say it merely \nfroze funds for programs already frozen by the President’s executive orders. That \ncannot be squared with the language of the Order or the factual record. As the Court \nfound, “Memorandum M-25-13 did not specify certain funds to be frozen; it froze all \nof them.” TRO Order at 21, ECF No. 30. Defendants’ inability to defend that action is \npowerful evidence that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \nThe express terms of the Order left no doubt that it required agencies to halt \n“all  activities  related  to  obligation  or  disbursement  of  all  Federal  financial \nassistance.” Freeze Order at 2 (emphasis added). Defendants seek (at 12, 21) to escape \nthat conclusion with an implausible parsing of this sentence from the Order: \n… Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to \nobligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other \nrelevant  agency  activities  that  may  be  implicated  by  the  executive \norders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, \nnongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the \ngreen new deal. \n \nId. (emphasis in original). Defendants claim that the phrase “that may be implicated \nby the executive orders” should be read to modify the command to “pause all activities \nrelated to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.” Defendants \nare wrong. The Order separately commands a pause of (1) all activities related to \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 3 of 27\nobligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and (2) other relevant \nagency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders. It would defy basic \ngrammar and ordinary usage to read a limitation that is specific to the latter category \nas applying to the former. \n  Any doubt is removed by the rest of the Freeze Order. As Plaintiffs previously \nshowed, ECF No. 40, at 4, and Defendants fail to address, the Order reiterates several \ntimes the breadth of the commanded freeze. The very next paragraph directs agencies \n“to pause all activities associated with open NOFOs [notices of funding opportunity],” \nFreeze Order at 2 (emphasis added), without limiting that command to programs \ncovered by an executive order. The next paragraph repeats that “[e]ach agency must \npause: (i) issuance of new awards; (ii) disbursement of Federal funds under all open \nawards;  and  (iii)  other  relevant  agency  actions  that  may  be  implicated  by  the \nexecutive orders. . . .” Id. (emphasis added). And the Order gives agencies just 24 \nhours to implement the freeze–a timeline that is wholly inconsistent with Defendants’ \nstory that agencies were supposed to review thousands of grants and freeze only those \nimplicated by the executive orders. \nStepping back, it appears to be undisputed that the purpose of the Order is to \nhalt  payments of  federal  financial assistance  so  that  agencies  can  review those \nprograms and determine which may be implicated by the executive orders. See id. \n(“To implement these orders, each agency must complete a comprehensive analysis \nof all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects, \nand activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders.”). \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 4 of 27\nDefendants’ new interpretation of convenience makes no sense in light of that express \npurpose: In Defendants’ telling, the Order commanded a pause only of programs \nimplicated  by  the  executive  orders  in  order  to  allow  agencies  to  identify  which \nprograms were implicated by the executive orders. \nWorse  for  Defendants,  nothing  in  the  record  suggests  that  any  agency \ninterpreted or implemented the Freeze Order in the way Defendants now urge. To the \ncontrary, the evidence shows that agencies well understood what they were being told \nto do. The National Science Foundation and Environmental Protection Agency, for \nexample, stated clearly that they were halting all payments at the command of the \nFreeze Order. ECF No. 24-1; ECF No. 24-2.1 And just like NSF and EPA, numerous \nother agencies implemented the Order by taking offline the centralized funding \nportals through which recipients of federal financial assistance draw on open awards, \nmaking  all  funds  functionally  unavailable.  E.g.,  ECF  No.  24-5  ¶¶  17–19.  That \napproach is entirely inconsistent with an effort to freeze only certain awards. As \nDefendants have previously conceded, ECF No. 26 at 6-7, numerous declarations in \nthis case describe halts to payments on open awards, starting at the time the Freeze \nOrder  was  issued,  that  cannot  possibly  be  attributed  to  the  executive  orders \nthemselves, e.g., ECF No. 24-6.  \nDefendants make much of a “guidance” document OMB put out the day after \nits Freeze Order. See ECF No. 11-1. That document, however, is no more meaningful \n \n1 Defendants say (at 9 n.1), without elaboration, that “those were errors.” But the only \n“error” appears to have been that the agencies candidly acknowledged what they were \ndoing and why. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 5 of 27\nthan Defendants’ purported “rescission” the next day. Far from interpreting the \nFreeze Order, the “guidance” is inconsistent with it, creating confusion, not clarity. \nFor example, while the Order commands a halt to “all activities related to obligation \nor disbursement of all Federal financial assistance,” the clean-up effort claims that \n“[a]ny program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to \nthe pause.” While the Order excludes any “assistance [i.e., money] received directly \nby individuals,” the rewrite claims more broadly that “[a]ny program that provides \ndirect  benefits  to  individuals  is  not  subject  to  the  pause.”  The  “guidance”  also \ndescribes entirely new carveouts for “mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP,” \nplus “small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other \nsimilar programs.”2 \nWhile in some cases a follow-on guidance document may functionally modify a \nchallenged policy, that was not the case with this  guidance. Rather,  the record \nevidence establishes that the Freeze Order was implemented as written even after \nthe  guidance  issued.  For  example,  contrary  to  the  “guidance,”  agencies  paused \npayments to small businesses and to Head Start programs. ECF No. 24-6; ECF \nNo. 24-3 at 74. Also contrary to the “guidance,” they cut off funding to numerous \nprograms that “provide[] direct benefits to individuals.” E.g., ECF No. 24-5 ¶¶ 14–16 \n(program to curtail violent crimes against women); ECF No. 27-1 ¶¶ 4–5 (care center \n \n2 These exclusions for small businesses, farmers, and others cannot be reconciled \neither with the actual Freeze Order (which halted essentially all payments) or with \nthe more limited order Defendants make believe here (which they say halted only \nprograms implicated by the executive orders), since small businesses and farmers are \njust as capable as anyone else of championing “wokeness” or “Marxist equity.” \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 6 of 27\nfor those with disabilities). “Both logic and record evidence point to the . . . conclusion” \nthat agencies did so at the command of the Freeze Order. See TRO Order at 17. Just \nas the rescission of the Freeze Order should not permit the evasion of legal review, \nthe guidance did not change the policy as implemented or undo the damage it caused.  \nThe Court therefore should dismiss the “guidance” as either irrelevant to the \npolicy  that  was  actually  implemented  and  challenged  here,  or  merely  another \nunsuccessful attempt at voluntary cessation, see infra Part I.C. \nB. As this Court previously found, Plaintiffs have standing. \n  Defendants complain (at 8) that Plaintiffs “make no effort” to establish this \nCourt’s jurisdiction. In fact, Plaintiffs already made that effort, see ECF No. 24 at 13–\n21, the Court agreed just two weeks ago, TRO Order at 6–19, and nothing has \nchanged since then, beyond the relief this Court ordered as a result of that finding. \nDefendants identify no good cause to reconsider that prior holding now. \n  As to injury in fact, this Court previously found that Plaintiffs have put forth \nevidence that “the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative, impending, and \npotentially catastrophic,” detailing “that many organizations need weekly injections \nof federal funds in order to continue operating.” TRO Order at 8–9. Rather than \ndisputing  that  conclusion—or  addressing  in  any  way  the  detailed  declarations \nPlaintiffs have provided—Defendants now argue that because these injuries do not \nflow from the executive orders mentioned in the Freeze Order, they must have been \ncaused by independent agency decisions, and not the Freeze Order itself. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 7 of 27\n  In short, Defendants—without providing a shred of supporting evidence—ask \n(at  12)  this  Court  to  believe  that  agencies  across  the  federal  government  all \nindependently happened to decide to freeze funding on a moment’s notice at the exact \nsame time that OMB ordered them to do so, and then independently each happened \nto decide to unfreeze their funding when OMB informed them of the TRO entered by \nthis Court. The more reasonable inference is that the Freeze Order itself, and not the \nexecutive orders, caused the widespread freeze, and that the agencies were simply \ndoing as OMB directed. This inference is also amply supported by statements from \nagencies themselves explaining that is precisely what they were doing. ECF No. 24-\n1; ECF No. 24-2. Justice may be blind, but it need not be blinkered to reality. See TRO \nOrder at 13 (noting that Defendants’ “explanation ignores both logic and fact”). \n  Defendants further argue (at 12) that Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims fail \nto identify the specific expressive activity that is threatened, and that Plaintiffs’ fears \nof lost future funding are irrelevant to this case. But the Court has already disposed \nof these arguments. TRO Order at 8. As the Court explained, Plaintiffs “claim that \nDefendants have singled out their funding programs (in other words, their economic \nlifelines) based on their exercise of speech and association.” Id. It is that exercise of \nspeech and association—made manifest in the positions Plaintiffs take on issues such \nas gender, racial equity, and environmental policy—that Plaintiffs claim is infringed \nby OMB’s action. See ECF No. 5-2 ¶ 14; ECF No. 5-3 ¶ 15; ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 29, 31; \nECF No. 5-5 ¶ 8.   \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 8 of 27\nAs to causation, Defendants again base their arguments on a version of the \nFreeze Order that simply does not exist. Defendants claim (at 13) that the Freeze \nOrder does not itself determine which grants are frozen, but leaves that to agency \ndiscretion. But it is impossible to square that belief with the plain text of the Freeze \nOrder, as described above, see supra Part I.A, or with the fact that meaningful \nexercise of any such discretion would be impossible to undertake in the limited time \nbefore  the  Freeze  Order took effect,  see  TRO  Order  at  17.  Defendants  have  no \ncounterargument: The only authority they cite is an out-of-circuit case this Court has \nalready deemed inapposite because, unlike the Freeze Order, the executive order at \nissue there required no action from federal agencies. See id. at 10–11 (distinguishing \nLouisiana ex rel. Landry v. Biden, 64 F.4th 674 (5th Cir. 2023)). \n  And as to redressability, Defendants again attempt (at 14) to shift blame to \nother agencies. But see TRO Order at 12–13. But the thrust of Plaintiffs’ complaint is \nthat OMB—not other agencies—is the author of their injuries through OMB’s clear \ndirective, which did not provide agencies with any meaningful discretion. As a last \neffort, Defendants point out (again at 14) that agencies may later decide to freeze \nPlaintiffs’ funding on their own. But speculation that other actors may take future \nactions that harm Plaintiffs cannot preclude this Court from affording relief against \nDefendants who, absent a Court order, risk harming Plaintiffs now. \nC. As this Court previously found, this case is not moot.  \n  Defendants likewise recycle their mootness argument—with a twist. Unable to \noffer a compelling reason for this Court to reconsider its ruling applying the voluntary \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 9 of 27\ncessation exception to mootness, Defendants argue (at 10) that things have changed \nsince the Court entered its TRO. Specifically: The Court entered its TRO, and as a \nresult, many of Plaintiffs’ members have had their funding restored. Defendants now \nsay that, because they appear to have taken steps to comply with the TRO they so \nstrongly resisted, it would be speculative to believe that they would resume their pre-\nTRO behavior. But if Defendants were right about that logic, then no court could ever \nenter a preliminary injunction following a TRO. \n  Defendants further argue (at 10–11) that mootness applies specifically in the \npreliminary injunction context, but fail to explain how this analysis would operate \ndifferently than it did for the TRO. In any event, this is little more than an effort to \nend-run around the voluntary cessation analysis: The cases on which Defendants rely \n(at 11) are clearly inapplicable here. In one, the Sixth Circuit found a preliminary-\ninjunction appeal moot where Plaintiffs complained of a rule that had already been \nrepealed and replaced—on the theory that another court could enjoin both the repeal \nrule and the replacement rule, and do so nationwide. Ohio v. EPA, 969 F.3d 306, 307–\n10 (6th Cir. 2020). In another, the District of South Dakota found that the requested \npreliminary relief—the establishment of satellite early voting locations—was moot \nbecause the defendants had voluntarily granted that exact relief, which was already \nin process. Brooks v. Gant, No. 12-cv-5003, 2012 WL 871262, at *1–2 (D.S.D. Mar. 14, \n2012). And in a third, the Southern District of New York found that there was no \nthreat of irreparable harm where a defendant in a trademark infringement suit had \nredesigned its mark in response to the plaintiff’s objections. Int’l Gemmological Inst., \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 10 of 27\nInc.  v.  Indep.  Gemological  Labs,  Inc.,  No. 00-cv-4897,  2000  WL  1278179,  at  *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2000). \nHere, Defendants suggest that preliminary relief is moot because they, too, \nhave voluntarily provided the relief sought. But they did not. As the Court’s prior \nanalysis made clear, TRO Order at 14–17, the purported rescission of the Freeze \nOrder did not in fact provide that relief at all. It was only the issuance of the TRO—\nnot the rescission—that provided Plaintiffs and their members with the relief they so \ndesperately needed: funding from grants that had already been awarded to them, and \nagainst which guarantee they had already incurred expenses.3 Finding mootness now \nwould only imperil that relief. \nLastly on mootness, Defendants argue (at 25) that the arbitrary and capricious \nclaim is moot, because any future across-the-board freeze would be supported by \nbetter  reasoning  than  the  Order  challenged  here.  Setting  aside  the  question  of \nwhether  any  explanation  could  possibly  render  such  action  “reasonable,”  this \nargument is just another attempt to resist application of the voluntary cessation \ndoctrine. As the Court found, TRO Order at 14–19, the Order’s purported “recission” \n \n3 Defendants glibly suggest (at 11) that if they revive the Freeze Order, Plaintiffs can \nsimply file another motion for a preliminary injunction. But neither Plaintiffs nor \nthis Court should be forced into more emergency proceedings because of Defendants’ \nconduct.  And, as the evidence shows, the uncertainty that would be created by \nDefendants’ approach is its own form of injury. See ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 25–26; ECF \nNo. 40-4 ¶¶ 6, 11–17. Defendants also were unable to turn the spigot of funding on as \nquickly as they turned it off, see ECF No. 40 at 33–34, meaning that even if Plaintiffs \nwere to seek and the Court to grant a preliminary injunction in the future, such an \norder may not provide practical relief for days or even weeks. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 11 of 27\ndid  not  stop  its  continued  implementation—without  Defendants  or  anyone  else \nproviding any additional rationale.4 \nD. Plaintiffs are likely to show final agency action and ripeness. \nAs the Court previously concluded, the Freeze Order constitutes final agency \naction subject to judicial review under the APA. TRO Order at 21–23; see also ECF \nNo. 40 at 12–15. Defendants can muster no persuasive reason the Court should \nreconsider that ruling. And their claims about ripeness fare no better. \nThey repeat (at 15) their claims that the Order did not itself freeze any funds, \nbut that assertion is belied by common sense and the factual record, which confirm, \nfor example, that agencies halted payments on open awards in direct response to the \nOrder. See, e.g., ECF No. 24-1; ECF No. 24-2. They again seek (at 15–16) to portray \nPlaintiffs’  challenge  to  a  specific  agency  action  and  its  implementation  as  “an \namorphous programmatic challenge.” But simply repeating this claim does not make \nit true. The fact that Defendants’ unlawful Freeze Order threatens to affect so many \nthousands of grant recipients is part of why the action is unreasonable; it does not \ninsulate that unreasonable action from review. And unlike this case, Defendants’ \n \n4 Indeed, it is far from clear that, even now, the rippling effects of the Freeze Order \nhave stopped. As Plaintiffs previously pointed out, ECF No. 40 at 9 & n.6, reporting \nshows that the director of FEMA’s Office of Grant Administration directed her team \nto put a “hold” on all open awards. Defendants’ counsel has now apprised Plaintiffs \nthat “the employee’s use of the word ‘hold’ was not intended to direct a freeze on \ngrant payments, but to enable further review of payment requests,” and that the \ndirector has subsequently clarified that the team is “not holding on awards” and \n“will still be processing” them, “but will be adding a level of internal controls to \nensure that payment requests are reviewed prior to payments be released [sic] to \nrecipients.” Although now framed as holding payments pending an indefinite and \nunspecified review, a distinction likely without much difference, it is telling that the \nemployee first described the action as an across-the-board freeze.  \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 12 of 27\ncited cases (at 16) did not involve challenges to specific final agency action and \ntherefore are readily distinguishable. \n  This case is also ripe for the Court’s review. Ripeness requires that “that an \ninjury in fact be certainly impending.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. United States, \n101  F.3d  1423,  1427  (D.C.  Cir.  1996).  “[I]f  a  threatened  injury  is  sufficiently \n‘imminent’ to establish standing, the constitutional requirements of the ripeness \ndoctrine will necessarily be satisfied.” Id. at 1428. As Plaintiffs have detailed, the \ninjury from Defendants’ action is not some far-off, speculative event; it was already \noccurring until this Court entered a temporary restraining order to stop it. \n  Defendants  nonetheless  protest  (at  17,  19)  that  Plaintiffs’  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  and  First  Amendment  claims  are  not  ripe  because  they  “necessarily \nrequire  fact-specific  analysis.”  Not  so.  That  the  Order  was not  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained,” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024), is clear from the face \nof the Order itself. And the fact that it is arbitrary and capricious warrants holding \nit unlawful as to all recipients with open awards—not just some. See, e.g., Nat’l \nMining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(“When a reviewing court determines that  agency regulations are unlawful, the \nordinary  result  is  that  the  rules  are  vacated—not  that  their  application  to  the \nindividual petitioners is proscribed.”). Defendants fail to explain what further facts \nthey believe need to be developed with respect to this claim, and the cases they cite \n(at 17) do not hold that agency action may be set aside as arbitrary and capricious \nonly if it can be shown to be arbitrary and capricious in every application. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 13 of 27\nSimilarly, for Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim to succeed, and contrary to \nDefendant’s position (at 19), Plaintiffs would not need to establish that the Order \nstifles the free expression of every funding recipient with an open award. See, e.g., \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 603 U.S. 707, 723 (2024) (explaining that courts will hold \na law facially invalid under the First Amendment even where just “a substantial \nnumber of [the law’s] applications”—rather than all of them—“are unconstitutional”).  \nE. Plaintiffs are likely to show the Freeze Order is arbitrary. \n  The Court previously held that Plaintiffs were likely to show that the Freeze \nOrder is arbitrary and capricious. TRO Order at 23–26. That remains the case. \nDefendants’ response falls flat. Defendants repeat (at 27–28, 29–30) their view \nthat the Order is reasonable because it: describes its objectives; exempts Medicare, \nSocial Security, and payments directly to individuals; provides for the theoretical \npossibility of additional exemptions on a “case-by-case” basis; “pause[s]” funding \ninstead of canceling it outright; and “provide[s] a delayed effective date” (of the very \nnext day). As Plaintiffs have explained, however, ECF No. 40 at 20–21, none of these \nattributes makes the Order rational. While without them, the Order would have been \neven more irrational, that is hardly sufficient. If identifying ways that an agency \naction could have been worse were enough to defeat an arbitrary and capricious \nchallenge, no action would ever be held unlawful under that standard. \nDefendants disparage (at 28) the obvious alternative approach they could have \ntaken:  reviewing  grants  while  those  programs  operated  as  normal.  But  their \njustifications  for  doing  so  are  unpersuasive  and,  crucially,  entirely  post  hoc, \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 14 of 27\nappearing nowhere in the Order itself. See, e.g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983) (explaining that “courts may \nnot accept . . . counsel’s post hoc rationalizations” and that “an agency’s action must \nbe upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself”).  \nSo Defendants try (repeatedly) to change the subject to the President. They \ncontend (at 26) that an agency cannot violate the APA if it is carrying out the \nPresident’s orders. That is a shocking position that, if accepted, would eviscerate the \nAPA’s  foundational  requirement  that  agency  action  be  both  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained.” See Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. at 292. It would mean, for example, \nthat all an administration needs to do to insulate agencies’ actions from arbitrary-\nand-capricious review would be to have the President order that those actions be \ntaken. But while the Court should soundly reject that view, it need not even address \nit here. That is because, try as Defendants might to obscure this fact, nothing in the \nrecord so much as suggests—let alone demonstrates—that the President instructed \nDefendants to issue the blanket freeze order.5  \n  For this reason among others, Defendants’ cited cases (at 26) are far afield. \nFranklin v. Massachusetts involved an action taken by the President—not an agency. \n505 U.S. 788, 796 (1992). The same is true of Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 470–72 \n(1994). And in Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v. Customs & Border Protection, the \nagency defendant was acting pursuant to an express delegation of the President’s \n \n5 Public reporting suggests just the opposite: that the Freeze Order “was produced by \nthe budget office alone” and not shared beforehand with the White House. Ashley \nParker, The Memo That Shocked the White House, The Atlantic (Jan. 29, 2025), \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/omb-white-house/681506/. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 15 of 27\nauthority under statute, and “in the realm of foreign affairs,” which the court found \nsignificant. 801 F. Supp. 2d 383, 401–03 (D. Md. 2011),  aff’d on other grounds, \n698 F.3d 171 (4th Cir. 2012). \n  Defendants further allege (at 28–29) that “Plaintiffs are asking this Court to \nimpose arbitrary timetables on the Executive.” What Plaintiffs are actually urging is \nthat arbitrary and capricious agency action is unlawful under the APA, and that the \n24-hour timetable that OMB gave agencies to turn off potentially trillions in federal \nfinancial assistance is one reason that action was arbitrary. Nor was the decision to \nimpose  that  timetable  made  by  “the  Executive”—assuming  that  term,  which \nDefendants’ response uses repeatedly, is meant to invoke the President.6 \nF. Plaintiffs are likely to show that OMB lacks statutory authority \nfor the Freeze Order. \n \n  Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on this claim as well, because agencies such as \nOMB “‘literally ha[ve] no power to act’ except to the extent Congress authorized \nthem,” Marin Audubon Soc’y v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 121 F.4th 902, 912 (D.C. Cir. \n2024) (quoting FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022)), and no statute authorized \nOMB to order a near total and near immediate halt to all federal financial assistance \nprograms, see ECF No. 40 at 21–26. \n  Defendants are unable to point to any statutory provision that would clearly \ngive  them  this  authority.  They  resort  instead  (at  32–33)  to  certain  general \n \n6 Although Defendants again trot out (at 28–29) some executive orders in which \npast Presidents—not OMB—ordered delays to funding for specific projects, the mere \nexistence of those program-specific pauses does not establish that Defendants’ \nFreeze Order was reasonable. \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 16 of 27\nresponsibilities of OMB’s deputy director for management. See 31 U.S.C. § 503(a). \nBut none of those responsibilities—e.g., “[m]onitor the financial execution of the \nbudget in relation to actual expenditures”—even imply the sweeping authority OMB \nclaims for itself here. And the statutory context in which they appear—as duties that \nthe  agency’s  second-in-command  must  carry  out,  “[s]ubject  to  the  direction  and \napproval of the Director,” 31 U.S.C. § 503(a)–strongly suggests they do not include \nthe authority to shut off federal financial assistance nationwide on 24 hours’ notice.7 \nAnd that’s before even getting to the major questions doctrine, which Defendants \nbarely address (at 33–34) but which requires identifying a clear statement from \nCongress before concluding that Congress has “authoriz[ed] an agency to exercise \npowers of vast economic and political significance.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. \nOSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). \n  Offering a new theory, Defendants point (at 31–32) to 31 U.S.C. §§ 1512 and \n1513(b), which authorize OMB to apportion appropriations. Defendants acknowledge \nthat they did not rely on this authority in issuing the Freeze Order and are careful \nnot to actually say that they could have, see Opp’n at 32 (“if OMB had authority to \nimplement the pause through apportionment. . . .” (emphasis added)), ECF No. 47. \nIt is doubtful they could have done so for all federal financial assistance programs \n \n7 Defendants’ resort (at 32–33) to Congress’s purposes in establishing the deputy \ndirector for management position does not help them. See Pub. L. No. 101-576, § 102, \n104 Stat. 2838, 2838 (1990). Congress’s goal of improving “management functions” so \nas to promote “a modern Federal financial management structure and associated \nsystems” hardly implies an authority to unilaterally freeze payments to thousands of \nclinics, shelters, emergency relief programs, medical researchers, small businesses, \nand many other recipients of federal funding across the country.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 17 of 27\nsimultaneously, given the procedures OMB must follow in order to apportion funds. \nSee, e.g., 31 U.S.C. § 1513(b)(2) (requiring that apportionment take place at specific \ntimes); Pub. L. No. 117-103, §§ 204, 748, 136 Stat. 49, 256-57, 306 (2022) (requiring \nthat OMB make public and report to Congress its apportionment decisions, and \nspecifically requiring OMB to notify Congress when such decisions “may hinder the \nprudent obligation of [an] appropriation or the execution of a program, project, or \nactivity”). For present purposes, it suffices to say that Defendants’ vaguely developed \nreference to an entirely different authority, one they acknowledge they did not use \nand do not actually show they could have used, does nothing to defeat Plaintiffs’ \nshowing that they are likely to succeed on this claim. \nG. Plaintiffs are likely to show that the Freeze Order is contrary \nto the First Amendment. \n \n  The Freeze Order commands agencies to halt payments to federal financial \nassistance programs in order to identify grant recipients that have expressed or \nsomehow associated themselves with disfavored viewpoints such as “woke gender \nideology” and “Marxist equity.” The result is a direct and immediate threat to the \nrights of free speech and association that Plaintiffs and other recipients of federal \nfunding enjoy under the First Amendment. See ECF No. 5-2 ⁋ 14 (describing grant \nrecipient’s reasonable fear that its “future receipt of federal financial assistance will \ndepend on [its] past and future exercise of its First Amendment rights”); ECF No. 5-\n4  ⁋  31  (describing  the  Order’s  chilling  effect  on  “[public  health  professionals’] \nresearch, our work, our expression, and our speech”). Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \nin showing that Defendants’ obvious attempt “at the suppression of dangerous ideas” \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 18 of 27\nvia “subsid[ies] . . . manipulated to have a coercive effect,” see Nat’l Endowment for \nthe Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 (1998), is unconstitutional. \nAs they have throughout, Defendants rely almost entirely on a single decades-\nold decision,  Rust  v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), and ignore the many cases \nPlaintiffs  have  cited  emphasizing  that  subsidies  may  not  be  used  to  suppress \ndisfavored ideas such as “wokeness,” see ECF No. 40 at 28–30. The Supreme Court, \nhowever, has cabined Rust’s reasoning in ways that make clear it does not apply here. \nAs the Court stated in Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, it has since understood Rust \nas  being  limited  to  situations  in  which  the  subsidized  activities  “amounted  to \ngovernmental speech.” 531 U.S. 533, 541 (2001). Here, by contrast, no one could \nreasonably attribute the expressive conduct of the many thousands of recipients of \nfederal financial assistance to the government. Cf. id. at 543–44 (distinguishing Rust \nbecause the speech at issue “cannot be classified as governmental speech even under \na generous understanding of that concept”). \nThe more relevant authority in this area is Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion for \nthe  Court  in  Agency  for  International  Development  v.  Alliance  for  Open  Society \nInternational, Inc., 570 U.S. 205 (2013). That decision squarely holds that while \nCongress  may  “define  the  limits  of  the  government  spending  program”  by \n“specify[ing]  the  activities  Congress  wants  to  subsidize,”  it  may  not  prescribe \n“conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of \nthe program itself.” Id. at 214–15. As Plaintiffs have explained and Defendants have \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 19 of 27\nfailed to rebut, see ECF No. 40 at 29–30, Plaintiffs are likely to establish that the \nFreeze Order falls on the wrong side of that line.8 \nA few other points are worth addressing. Defendants seem to suggest (at 36) \nthat Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on this claim unless every grantee describes a \nconcern for their ability to engage in expressive conduct. That is not how the First \nAmendment works. See, e.g., Moody, 603 U.S. at 723 (explaining that laws may be \nheld facially invalid even if not unconstitutional in all applications). Defendants \ninvoke (at 35) the discussion of lump-sum appropriations in Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. \n182  (1993),  but  the  Freeze  Order  commanded  a  near  across-the-board  halt  to \npayments on financial assistance programs—not the allocation to different objects of \na  lump-sum  appropriation.  And  Defendants  seek  to  portray  (also  at  35)  the \nundisguised hostility of the Order’s language as just a valid exercise of government \nspeech. But what it underscores is the Order’s clear and obvious purpose to suppress \nviewpoints with which the administration disagrees. Cf. Masterpiece Cakeshop v. \nColo. C.R. Comm’n, 584 U.S. 617, 634–38 (2018) (finding that state violated its “duty \nunder  the  First  Amendment  not  to  base  laws  or  regulations  on  hostility  to  a \n \n8 Indeed, as Defendants acknowledge (at 36), one of the executive orders that the \nFreeze Order purports to help implement specifically instructs agencies to identify \ngrant recipients to OMB based on their past speech or association with disfavored \nideas—not the activities for which they are presently receiving funding. See Exec. \nOrder No. 14,151 § 2(b)(ii)(C), Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339, 8340 (Jan. 20, 2025). While that \norder is not itself before the Court here, it confirms that as to the broader freeze, \nDefendants are not merely engaged in an effort to define the activities that should \nbe federally subsidized going forward. To be clear: Although the executive orders \nmay well violate the First Amendment (or be otherwise unlawful) themselves, the \nFreeze Order is responsible for an independent First Amendment injury. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 20 of 27\n[particular] viewpoint” where state’s conduct suggested “a clear and impermissible \nhostility toward” that viewpoint). \nII.  Plaintiffs have amply demonstrated the irreparable harm they face. \nPlaintiffs “easily meet their burden” to show irreparable injury through the \nmany documented examples of “existential injuries” their members will suffer. TRO \nOrder at 26–27. Plaintiffs have also shown irreparable harm to themselves and their \nmembers  from  being  unable  to  carry  out  their  core  missions  and  from  the \ninfringement of core First Amendment rights. See ECF No. 40 at 30–35. \nRather than grapple with those injuries, Defendants repackage their standing \nand mootness claims—to no greater effect. Once more, they contend (at 37–38) that \nbecause the declarants can now draw on their open awards, any fears of a resumed \nfunding  freeze  are  mere  speculation.  But—again—this  argument  fails  to \nacknowledge that the declarants received relief only because this Court ordered it. \nSee supra Part I.C. Plaintiffs need not show, as Defendants suggest, “proof” that the \nFreeze Order would be reissued; as this Court has found, a large part of the problem \nis that the Freeze Order was never truly rescinded. See TRO Order at 16–17.9 \nAs to the irreparable harm incurred by Plaintiffs’ First Amendment violation, \nDefendants largely repeat their standing arguments, which fail to convince for the \nsame reasons. See supra Part I.B. Defendants reiterate their view that because the \n \n9 Defendants seek (at 38) to distinguish League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d \n1 (D.C. Cir. 2016), because that case “involved a threat of prospective harm arising \nfrom  clearly  defined  agency  action  that  was  still  in  place.”  As  this  description \nsuggests,  Defendants  miss  the  point:  League  of  Women  Voters  is  relevant  here \nprecisely  because,  as  in  that  case,  the  action  of  which  Plaintiffs  complain  still \nthreatens to harm them, but for the temporary restraining order holding it at bay. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 21 of 27\nFreeze  Order  was  purportedly  rescinded,  any  First  Amendment  injury  must  be \ncaused by actions outside the scope of this lawsuit. This argument again overlooks \nthat the Order was not truly rescinded and that its implementation was reversed only \nby the Court’s intervention. \nIII.  The public interest weighs strongly in favor of injunctive relief. \nDefendants likewise offer no cause to disturb this Court’s finding that “the \nbalance of the equities and public interest heavily favor” injunctive relief. TRO Order \nat 29. They once again rely (at 40) on debunked arguments that no harm can flow \nfrom a rescinded memo, and that the harm that immediately followed the Freeze \nOrder was due to some other mysterious, unnamed source.  \nDefendants ignore the “far-reaching effects” of the Freeze Order, TRO Order \nat 28, preferring to focus closer to home: They contend that the only harm at issue is \nthe irreparable injury they will suffer by being prevented from “effectuating statutes \nenacted by representatives of [the] people.’” Opp’n at 40 (quoting Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers)). It is not clear which statute \nenacted by Congress OMB believes it will be precluded from effectuating; certainly \nnot any of the appropriations Congress made which OMB now tries to withhold. And, \nin any event, it is blackletter law that “the government has no interest in acting \nunlawfully” and that “the public has an interest in having its government follow the \nlaw.” Ramirez v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 568 F. Supp. 3d 10, 34 (D.D.C. 2021). \nFinally, Defendants attempt to shoehorn into the public interest analysis a \ncomplaint about the scope of relief, claiming (at 41) that “[a] broad preliminary \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 22 of 27\ninjunction would have a significant chilling effect on the President’s and his advisors’ \nability to lawfully direct and guide agencies’ spending decisions.” It remains unclear, \nthough,  how  a  preliminary  injunction  against  OMB  and  its  director—not  the \nPresident—in an APA case could chill the President at all.  \nIV.  Staying injunctive relief or requiring a bond would undermine this \nCourt’s ruling. \nIn  contesting  the  scope  of  relief,  Defendants  first  argue  (at  42)  that  any \npreliminary injunction should be limited to grant awards to Plaintiffs alone. But that \nfails to account for the rule in this Circuit that the appropriate remedy in APA \nlitigation is to set aside agency action in its entirety. See, e.g., Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 145 \nF.3d at 1409; see also D.C. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 47 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(explaining  that  “[t]he  same  reasoning  has  force  in  the  preliminary  injunction \ncontext”). Instead, Defendants rely on a quotation selectively pulled from a discussion \nof the lower evidentiary standards that apply to a preliminary injunction, as opposed \nto a trial on the merits. Opp’n at 42 (quoting Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. \n390, 395 (1981)). And they do not explain how it would be practicable to sort out which \nawards  belong  to  Plaintiffs’  members,  which  number  in  the  tens  of  thousands. \nSee ECF No. 5-3 ¶ 2; ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 1; ECF No. 5-5 ¶ 2. \nDefendants next argue (also at 42) that any relief should be limited to the \nFreeze Order, and not to future iterations thereof. But what is already clear from the \nshort history of this case is that for an injunction to be worth the paper, it must \nprevent Defendants from continuing to implement the same challenged conduct.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 23 of 27\nDefendants cite (at 43) a number of cases for the proposition that this Court \nshould enter more limited relief, but none are helpful to the analysis. Carlson v. \nPostal Regulatory Commission makes the point that “the APA permits a court to sever \na rule by setting aside only the offending parts of the rule,” 938 F.3d 337, 351 \n(D.C. Cir. 2019)—but Defendants do not ask the Court to sever the Freeze Order and \ndo not attempt the relevant severability analysis. In City of New York v. Mickalis \nPawn  Shop,  LLC,  the  Second  Circuit  addressed  a  problematic  injunction  that \nrequired  a  defendant  to  “adopt  prophylactic  measures  to  prevent  violation”  of \nfirearms laws, without identifying just how “the defendants must alter their behavior \nto comply with those laws.” 645 F.3d 114, 144 (2d Cir. 2011) (alteration omitted). But \nthis bears no resemblance to the proposed order Plaintiffs submitted (and Defendants \ndo not actually claim otherwise).  \nIn Northern Air Cargo v. U.S. Postal Service, from the Chevron era, the court \nremanded to the agency to ask it for an authoritative interpretation of a “hopelessly” \nambiguous statute. 674 F. 3d 852, 855 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Here, there is no similar need \nto remand for OMB to do anything. State Farm sent an arbitrary and capricious rule \nback  to  the  agency  for further consideration—but,  unlike  here,  the  agency  was \nstatutorily required to issue standards via rulemaking. 463 U.S. at 46. No such \nfurther  agency  action  is  necessary  here.  Public  Employees  for  Environmental \nResponsibility  v.  National  Park  Service  provides  an  analysis  of  the  ratification \ndoctrine, which is wholly inapplicable here. 605 F. Supp. 3d 28, 49 (D.D.C. 2022). \nIn re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litigation only confirms that the point of a preliminary \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 24 of 27\ninjunction is to maintain the status quo, which is precisely what Plaintiffs seek. 333 \nF.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003). And Sherley v. Sebelius simply held that NIH was not \nrequired to specifically address comments opposing all embryonic stem-cell research \nwhen it issued guidance, at the direction of an executive order, setting out the terms \non which NIH funding would be available for such research. 689 F.3d 776, 784–85 \n(D.C. Cir. 2012). Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants ignored \nany comments, and no executive order or anything else required that they issue the \nFreeze Order. \nDefendants next try to coerce Plaintiffs to limit relief themselves. They ask (at \n44–45) that the Court require the plaintiff associations to “post a bond commensurate \nwith  the  scope  of  relief  ordered”—meaning,  apparently,  sufficient  to  cover  all \npayments on open grants the government makes while the injunction is in effect. That \nsuggestion is facially absurd. Defendants point to no example of a court ordering a \nbond in analogous circumstances. But cf. Powelton Civic Home Owners Ass’n v. Dep’t \nof  Hous.  and  Urb.  Dev.,  284  F.  Supp.  809,  840–41  (E.D.  Pa.  1968)  (rejecting \n“proposition that Rule 65(c) was intended to raise virtually insuperable financial \nbarriers insulating the agency’s decision from effective judicial scrutiny”).  \nDefendants also make no effort to explain how OMB and its director could \nthemselves suffer monetary harm from the ordinary disbursement of payments on \nopen awards such that the bond requirement would be even theoretically applicable \nhere. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) (providing that bond may be appropriate to “pay the \ncosts and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined”); \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 25 of 27\nFed. Prescription Serv., Inc. v. Am. Pharm. Ass’n, 636 F.2d 755, 759 (D.C. Cir. 1980) \n(confirming that courts may “dispense with any security requirement whatsoever \nwhere the restraint will do the defendant no material damage” or “where there has \nbeen no proof of likelihood of harm” (quotation marks omitted)).  \nGiven the lack of any plausible claim to damages by OMB or Director Vought, \nand  the  sheer  scale  of  the  bond  they  suggest,  it  is  difficult  to  conclude  that \nDefendants’ request is anything other than an effort to retaliate against Plaintiffs for \nbringing  this  suit  and  to  discourage  potential  litigants  from  bringing  further \nactions—ironic in a case that turns in part on Defendants’ efforts to suppress other \nexercises  of  First  Amendment  rights.  See generally  Borough  of  Duryea,  Pa.  v. \nGuarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 387 (2011) (“[T]he right of access to courts for redress of \nwrongs is an aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the government.”). The \nCourt should reject Defendants’ request out of hand. \nFinally, Defendants ask (at 45) the Court to stay any injunction pending \nappeal. The Court should deny that request, too, because Plaintiffs have shown they \nare likely to succeed on the merits, would be irreparably harmed without the Court’s \nintervention, and that the balance of equities heavily favors keeping injunctive relief \nin place. See generally Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433–34 (2009). \nCONCLUSION \n  For all these reasons and those in Plaintiffs’ motion, the Court should enter a \npreliminary injunction, without a bond and without a stay.  \n \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 49     Filed 02/18/25     Page 26 of 27\nDated:  February 18, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Kevin E.

ECF No. 56.  For the reasons explained below, the court denies the motion. \nPlaintiffs filed this action on January 28, 2025 and simultaneously sought a temporary \nrestraining order to  prevent Defendants  from  implementing  the Office of Management and \nBudget’s “Memorandum M-25-13.”  ECF Nos. 1, 5.  Later that day, the court entered a brief \nadministrative stay until February 3.  ECF No. 13.  Following briefing and argument, the court \nentered a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) on February 3.  The TRO enjoined Defendants \n“from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the directives in OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”  \nECF No. 30, at 29.  The court also required Defendants to “provide written notice of the court’s \n[TRO] to all agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-25-13 was addressed” informing them of \nthe TRO and “instruct[ing] those agencies to release any disbursements on open awards that were \npaused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”  Id.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 59     Filed 03/14/25     Page 2 of 4\nOn February 5, Defendants filed a status report and attached the written notice they had \nsent to the agencies.  In it, Defendants informed the agencies that “open awards” meant “all forms \nof Federal financial assistance within the scope of OMB Memorandum M-25-13 ‘that have already \nbeen approved and partially disbursed.’”  ECF No. 39-1, at 1.  Plaintiffs did not object to the \nlanguage in the notice.   \nBetween February 11 and 18, the parties briefed Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion \nwhile the TRO remained in effect.  ECF Nos. 40, 47, 49.  On February 20, the court held a hearing \non the preliminary injunction motion during which Plaintiffs represented that they were seeking \nrelief “within the bounds originally described at the TRO stage . . . for open awards.”  Tr. of \nPrelim.

The injunction prohibited Defendants “from implementing, giving effect to, or \nreinstating  under  a  different  name  the  unilateral,  non-individualized  directives  in  OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”  \nECF No. 52, at 1.  As was the case with the TRO order, the court instructed Defendants to notify \naffected agencies about the scope of the preliminary injunction.  Id.   \nOn February 27, Defendants filed a status report containing a new notice.  ECF No. 54.  \nThe notice again defined “open awards” as “all forms of Federal financial assistance within the \nscope of OMB Memorandum M-25-13 ‘that have already been approved and partially disbursed.’”  \nECF No. 54-1, at 1.  Again, Plaintiffs did not object to the language in the notice. \nOn March 4, Plaintiffs filed this motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction.  \nThey argue that Defendants’ “cramped interpretation” of “open awards” resulted in the Department \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 59     Filed 03/14/25     Page 3 of 4\nof Housing and Urban Development’s (“HUD”) withholding of $3.6 billion in Continuum of Care \ngrants that had been awarded on January 17 but have not yet been disbursed.  ECF No. 56, at 1-2, \n6-7.1  Plaintiffs ask the court to “clarify that the preliminary injunction’s directives regarding ‘all \nopen awards’ applies to all awards that have been awarded—i.e., [where] the recipient has been \nnotified of the decision to award the grant, loan, or other financial assistance or the award has \notherwise been made public,” and not just those that have been both awarded and partially \ndisbursed.  Id. at 2.   \nDefendants oppose the motion, arguing that the court’s order only applies to open awards \nthat have been “partially disbursed” and that Plaintiffs did not take issue with the Defendants’ \ncharacterization of the order in its notices.  ECF No. 57, at 8-10.  Defendants also argue that \nPlaintiffs improperly seek to expand the court’s preliminary injunction to include the “obligation,” \nrather than just the “disbursement,” of open awards.  Id. at 10-14.  Finally, Defendants assert that \nPlaintiffs fail to point to any tangible evidence of harm in the absence of the requested clarification.  \nId. at 14-17. \nWhile the court does not expressly endorse Defendants’ narrow reading of the TRO and \nthe preliminary injunction, it acknowledges that Defendants and various government agencies \nhave been operating under Defendants’ interpretation of “open awards” since early February.  \nPlaintiffs had multiple opportunities to dispute Defendants’ characterization but did not do so until \n \n1 Plaintiffs explain that, once HUD announces Continuum of Care grants on its website, “individual \naward letters” to the recipients usually follow “within a few weeks.”  ECF No. 56, at 7 n.4.  It does \nnot appear that those letters were ever issued, but Plaintiffs characterize their issuance as a \n“purely . . . ministerial task that does not move these awarded grants outside the category of ‘all \nopen awards.’”  Id.; see ECF No. 58-3.  Defendants vehemently contest this characterization and \ninstead argue that “after a Continuum of Care grant is awarded, there is a significant and potentially \nlengthy administrative process prior to the grant agreement being signed and the funds being \nobligated to the recipient.”  ECF No. 57, at 12.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 59     Filed 03/14/25     Page 4 of 4\nthe present motion.  Specifically, Defendants publicized their interpretation in two court filings, \nthe first of which was filed on February 5 in response to the TRO.  Despite having full knowledge \nof how Defendants were defining “open awards” following the TRO, Plaintiffs did not seek to \nexpand the scope of the TRO during the preliminary injunction proceedings.  Nor did they raise \nan objection to Defendant’s second notice, filed on February 27, which contained the same \ninterpretation.   \nPlaintiffs represent that they only “recently bec[a]me aware” that HUD was not disbursing \nthe Continuum of Care grant funds, ECF No. 56-1 ¶ 4, but that has been the state of affairs since \nJanuary 17, id. ¶¶ 6; ECF No. 58-1 ¶ 4; ECF No. 58-2 ¶ 6.  Because individual award letters can \ntake between “two to three weeks” to issue, ECF No. 58-3 ¶ 6, the lack of disbursements from \nHUD would have been conspicuous by early February.  Even so, Plaintiffs did not raise any issue \nwith Defendants’ notices or address the matter at the preliminary injunction hearing.  Given \nPlaintiffs’ failure to object to Defendants’ characterization of “open awards” until now, the court \ndeclines to revisit the scope of the preliminary injunction.  Accordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion to Clarify the Scope of the Preliminary Injunction, ECF \nNo. 56, is DENIED.   \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \nLOREN L. ALIKHAN \nUnited States District Judge  \n \nDate:  March 14, 2025 \n4 ",

The Court’s preliminary injunction order \nexpressly applied “with respect to the disbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards.”  In \nits order granting a temporary restraining order, the Court expressly referred to “open awards” as \n“ones that have already been approved and partially disbursed.”  ECF No. 30 at 22.  Defendants \nquoted that exact phrasing in their written notices to federal agencies regarding both the Court’s \ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction order, and that is the understanding \nDefendants (and other agencies) have operated under for over a month.  The Court’s orders were \nunambiguous, and Plaintiffs did not object to Defendants’ use of this definition in their written \nnotice regarding the Court’s temporary restraining order.  In fact, Plaintiffs represented that the \nCourt’s temporary restraining order provided them the relief they sought, and stated that their \npreliminary injunction motion was only requesting relief within the same bounds.  Yet now, weeks \nafter Defendant first filed a written notice containing this language, Plaintiffs seek to contest this \ndefinition of “open awards,” on the rationale that the Court’s own reference to open awards “does \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 2 of 17\nnot appear to be what the Court was actually saying.”  Mot. to Clarify (ECF No. 56) at 9.  The \nCourt should reject Plaintiffs’ motion, because the Court’s order was not vague or ambiguous. \nThe Court should also deny Plaintiffs’ motion because it seeks to improperly alter or amend \nthe Court’s preliminary injunction order.  The Court’s order was clear that OMB’s instructions to \nagencies applied only with respect to the “disbursement” of federal funding, but Plaintiffs’ motion \nseeks to expand those instructions to apply to additional activities, including those relating to the \nobligation of funding.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ motion and its supporting declaration make clear that \nthey are asking the Court to alter its ruling to relate not just to “disbursement” of funding but also \nto other grant-related activities including the signing of grant agreements.  While Plaintiffs do not \nexpressly acknowledge that they are seeking to amend the Court’s order to apply with respect to \nobligation of funding, this fact is laid bare in their proposed order, which seeks to require \nDefendants to instruct federal agencies not just regarding “disbursement” of Federal funds, but \nalso “with respect to all activities related to the obligation . . . of Federal funds.”  The Court’s order \nonly applied with respect to “disbursement” of federal funding, and Plaintiffs cannot use a motion \nto clarify as a vehicle to materially expand the Court’s order.  Plaintiffs’ attempt to do so only \nunderscores the fact that they seek to use this lawsuit to turn this Court into a superintendent over \ncountless Executive Branch decisions made by non-defendant agencies relating to federal funding. \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ motion should also be rejected because they do not identify any harm to \nthem caused by Defendants’ instructions.  Plaintiffs allege that certain Plaintiff members have been \nawarded Continuum of Care grants by the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) and have not received disbursement of funding.  However, after the Court issued its \ntemporary restraining order, Defendants provided an identical instruction to federal agencies \nregarding the definition of “open awards,” and Plaintiffs subsequently represented that the Court’s \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 17\ntemporary restraining order was holding any alleged harm to them at bay, even though the relevant \nPlaintiff members had allegedly already received their awards and had not received disbursement \nof funding.  Plaintiffs do not come forth with any direct evidence that runs counter to their prior \nrepresentations that Defendants’ instruction was adequate to prevent harm to them.  Instead, \nPlaintiffs rely on a hearsay declaration that merely makes generalized allegations of potential harm.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs fail to explain how any alleged harm to the relevant Plaintiff members is \nattributable to the challenged OMB Memorandum 25-13, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, \nLoan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, 2025) (“OMB Memo”), given that those \nmembers were apparently awarded Continuum of Care grants on January 17, 2025 and they did \nnot sign a grant agreement or receive disbursements prior to the January 27, 2025 issuance of the \nOMB Memo.  Given that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are harmed by the instruction \nthey object to, they fail to show that any clarification is necessary, let alone a material expansion \nof the Court’s order. \nBACKGROUND \n  On January 28, 2025, Plaintiffs filed this case against OMB and the Acting Director of \nOMB, seeking an order nullifying the OMB Memo.  See Compl. (ECF No. 1).  Plaintiffs moved \nfor a temporary restraining order against the OMB Memo, see ECF No. 5, and this Court entered \na partial administrative stay as to the Memo, directing that “Defendants shall refrain from \nimplementing OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds \nunder all open awards.”  ECF No. 13 at 4-5.  The Court explained that the scope of the \nadministrative stay was “tailored to Plaintiffs’ concern that a lapse in existing federal funding will \ncause irreparable injuries to recipients and their programs.”  Id. at 4. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 4 of 17\n  While OMB rescinded the challenged OMB Memo the day after this Court’s administrative \nstay, the parties proceeded to litigate Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order as well as \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss.  See ECF Nos. 5, 20, 24, 26.  This Court held a hearing on February \n3, 2025, after which the Court entered a temporary restraining order and denied Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss.  See TRO Op. & Order (ECF No. 30).  The Court ordered that “Defendants are \nenjoined from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the directives \nin OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open \nawards.”  Id. at 29.  The Court also ordered that “Defendants must provide written notice of the \ncourt’s temporary restraining order to all agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-25-13 was \naddressed,” with that written notice “instruct[ing] those agencies that they may not take any steps \nto  implement,  give  effect  to,  or  reinstate  under  a  different  name  the  directives  in  OMB \nMemorandum 25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards” \nand “also instruct[ing] those agencies to release any disbursements on open awards that were \npaused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”  Id.  In discussing “open awards,” the Court’s Order \nreferred to them as “ones that have already been approved and partially disbursed.”  Id. at 22.   \n  Consistent with the Court’s order, Defendants filed a copy of the required written notice \nwith the Court on February 5, 2025.  See ECF Nos. 39, 39-1.  In the written notice, Defendants \ninstructed agencies that they “may not take any steps to implement, give effect to, or reinstate \nunder  a  different  name  the  directives  in  OMB  Memorandum  M-25-13  with  respect  to  the \ndisbursement  of  Federal  Funds  under  all  open  awards”  and  that  they  must  “release  any \ndisbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”  ECF No. \n39-1.  Consistent with the Court’s language regarding “open awards,” Defendants’ written notice \nprovided that “[i]n the above instructions, ‘open awards’ means all forms of Federal financial \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 17\nassistance within the scope of OMB Memorandum M-25-13 ‘that have already been approved and \npartially  disbursed.’”    Id.    In  their  status  report  attaching  the  written  notice,  Defendants \n“respectfully request[ed] that the Court notify the Defendants if they have misunderstood the \nintended scope of the Court’s Order.”  ECF No. 39 at 2.  The Court did not raise any concerns \nregarding Defendants’ interpretation of its Order.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs did not raise any \nconcerns to counsel for Defendants or the Court regarding Defendants’ written notice.   \n  Subsequently, the parties litigated Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  See ECF \nNos. 40, 47, 49.  In Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, they made clear that “[t]he \nindividual declarants who at the TRO stage described their difficulties accessing funds have since \nbeen able to draw on their open awards.”  Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (ECF No. 40) at 9.   They further \nnoted that “[m]any others of Plaintiffs’ members are now also able to draw on open awards.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs  attributed  this  to  the  Court’s  temporary  restraining  order,  stating  that  “Plaintiffs \ncomplained that the OMB Memo froze the disbursement of open grant awards” and that “[t]his \nCourt entered the relief Plaintiffs sought, and those funds began flowing again.”  Id. at 33 n.10; \nsee also Reply in Support of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (ECF No. 49) at 20 (stating that “declarants can \nnow draw on their open awards” and that “declarants received relief only because this Court \nordered it”).   \n  The Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction on February 20, \n2025.  At the hearing, Plaintiffs reiterated that “funds have been unfrozen” and that “the declarants, \nwhose testimony supported [their] motion for a TRO, have been able to access their funds.”  PI \nHrg. Tr. at 3.  Thus, in arguing for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs told the Court that “the TRO \nhas had a real effect for our clients in getting their members access to funding that they’re entitled \nto under open awards.”  Id. at 4.  Regarding the scope of relief, the Court noted that “when we first \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 6 of 17\nwere here on the administrative stay and again on the TRO, all we were focused on was the \ndisbursement of monies under open awards.”  Id. at 19.  The Court asked if that was “still \n[Plaintiffs’] position.”  Id.  Plaintiffs replied that they were “still requesting relief sort of within \nthe bounds originally described at the TRO stage, so for open awards.”  Id.  Additionally, the \nPlaintiffs also discussed their claims as relating to “the continued receipt of funds on open awards” \nand described their alleged fear “that their money is not going to resume.”  Id. at 53-54.   \n  On February 25, 2025, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  See \nECF Nos. 51, 52.  The Court’s order was substantively similar in scope to its temporary restraining \norder.  Specifically, the Court ordered that “Defendants are enjoined from implementing, giving \neffect to, or reinstating under a different name the unilateral, non-individualized directives in OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”  \nECF No. 52 at 1.  The Court further ordered that “Defendants must provide written notice of the \ncourt’s  preliminary  injunction  to  all  agencies  to  which  OMB  Memorandum  M-25-13  was \naddressed,” and that that written notice must “instruct those agencies that they may not take any \nsteps  to  implement,  give  effect  to,  or  reinstate  under  a  different  name  the  unilateral,  non-\nindividualized directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respective to the disbursement of \nFederal Funds under all open awards,” and “instruct those agencies to continue releasing any \ndisbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”  Id.   \n  Consistent with the Court’s order Defendants filed a copy of the written notice on February \n28, 2025.  See ECF Nos. 54, 54-1.  Defendants’ notice was substantially the same as the written \nnotice they provided to agencies regarding the Court’s temporary restraining order.  Defendants \ninstructed agencies that they “may not take any steps to implement, give effect to, or reinstate \nunder a different name the unilateral, non-individualized directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-\n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 17\n13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards” and that they must \n“continue  releasing  any  disbursements  on  open  awards  that  were  paused  due  to  OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13.”  ECF No. 54-1.  As they had done in their written notice regarding the \ntemporary restraining order, and consistent with the definition of “open awards” set forth in the \nCourt’s order granting the temporary restraining order, Defendants’ written notice stated that \n“‘open  awards’  means  all  forms  of  Federal  financial  assistance  within  the  scope  of  OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 ‘that have already been approved or partially disbursed.’”  Id.   \n  On March 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion to clarify the scope of the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction.  See ECF No. 56.  For the first time, Plaintiffs contested the definition of “open awards” \nthat was contained in Defendants’ written notice to agencies that was filed on February 5, 2025, \nand in Defendants’ written notice to agencies that was filed on February 28, 2025.  Plaintiffs ask \nthe Court to “clarify” that the term “open awards” in the Court’s preliminary injunction order \n“includes all forms of Federal financial assistance that have been awarded (e.g., an award that has \nbeen publicly announced or news of the award has been communicated to the grantee), regardless \nof whether those funds have been partially disbursed,” ECF No. 56-2 at 1; see also ECF No. 56 at \n2, rather than applying the definition of “open awards” as Federal financial assistance within the \nscope of the OMB Memo “that ha[s] already been approved and partially disbursed,” ECF No. 30 \nat 22.  Plaintiffs further request that the Court expand its preliminary injunction order’s directives \nto OMB beyond just disbursement but also to the obligation of federal financial assistance—asking \nthe Court to require that Defendants instruct federal agencies “that they may not take any steps to \nimplement, give effect to, or reinstate under a different name the unilateral, non-individualized \ndirectives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to all activities related to the obligation \nor disbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards, regardless of whether the funds have \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 8 of 17\nbeen partially disbursed.”  ECF No. 56-2 at 1-2 (emphasis added).  Similarly, Plaintiffs ask that \nthe Court direct Defendants to instruct agencies “to continue all activities related to obligating and \nreleasing any disbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-\n13.”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).     \nARGUMENT \nI.  Clarification is Unnecessary Because the Court’s Order was not Ambiguous or Vague \n“The general purpose of a motion for clarification is to explain or clarify something \nambiguous or vague, not to alter or amend.”  United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 793 F. Supp. \n2d 164, 168 (D.D.C. 2011).  Plaintiffs seek to clarify the scope of the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction, because they contend that Defendants’  instruction  to  federal  agencies  “narrowly \nconstrued” the Court’s order “in a manner that is inconsistent with the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction decision and order.”  ECF No. 56 at 1.  No such clarification is necessary.  The Court’s \norder was not “ambiguous or vague.”  The Court previously referred to “open awards” as awards \n“that have already been approved and partially disbursed.”  ECF No. 30 at 22.  In their written \nnotice to federal agencies regarding the Court’s preliminary injunction order, Defendants adopted \nthat same language, defining “open awards” to include “all forms of Federal financial assistance \nwithin the scope of OMB Memorandum M-25-13 ‘that have already been approved and partially \ndisbursed.’”  ECF No. 54-1 at 1.  Plaintiffs now object to this definition of the term “open awards” \nbecause it requires that awards have been partially disbursed.  But there is no ambiguity here, as \nhighlighted by Plaintiffs’ failure to object to this definition during the several-week period since \nDefendants filed their written notice implementing the Court’s TRO, and given that Defendants’ \ninstructions directly quoted the Court’s own language regarding “open awards.”   \nPlaintiffs do not meaningfully argue that clarification from the Court is necessary regarding \nDefendants’ use of language taken directly from the Court.  Instead, Plaintiffs assert that the \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 9 of 17\nCourt’s own language “does not appear to be what the Court was actually saying.”  ECF No. 56 at \n9.  Plaintiffs do not explain the basis for this conclusion, failing to point to any language in which \nthe Court suggested that “open awards” include awards that have not been partially disbursed.  \nPlaintiffs analyze the Village of Bensenville v. Federal Aviation Administration, 457 F.3d 52 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) case that the Court was discussing when the Court referred to “open awards” in this \nmanner, see ECF No. 56 at 9-10, but Plaintiffs fail to explain why the details of that case bear on \nthe Court’s understanding of “open awards,” let alone suggest that the Court had a different \ndefinition in mind.  To the contrary, while the Court’s preliminary injunction decision did not \nexpressly define the term “open awards” again, the Court’s order implicitly endorsed its prior \nunderstanding of the term, ordering Defendants to instruct agencies to “continue releasing” any \ndisbursements on open awards, ECF No. 52 at 1—language which appears to presuppose that \ndisbursements have previously been made.     \nFurther underscoring the lack of need for clarification of the Court’s preliminary injunction \norder, Defendants’ previous written notice to federal agencies regarding the Court’s temporary \nrestraining order used the exact same language defining “open awards.”  See ECF No. 39-1 at 1.  \nThat written notice was filed on the docket on February 5, 2025, and Plaintiffs never objected to \nit, despite there being 20 days between Defendants’ filing of that written notice and the Court’s \nissuance of its preliminary injunction order.     \nOn top of not objecting to the identical language in Defendants’ written notice regarding \nthe Court’s temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs expressly disavowed any request for broader \nrelief at the preliminary injunction stage than they had received at the TRO stage.  In the \npreliminary injunction hearing, the Court noted to Plaintiffs’ counsel that “when we first were here \non the administrative stay and again on the TRO, all we were focused on was the disbursement of \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 10 of 17\nmonies under open awards.”  PI Hrg. Tr. at 19.  The Court asked Plaintiffs: “Is that still your \nposition or are you seeking a PI as it goes to the NOFOs or sort of other aspects of the memo?”  \nId.  Plaintiffs replied that “[t]hat is still our position” and “[w]e’re still requesting relief sort of \nwithin the bounds originally described at the TRO stage, so for open awards.”  Id.   \nThus, at the TRO stage, Defendants’ written notice defined “open awards” using the \nCourt’s stated description of the term.  Plaintiffs did not object to that interpretation and proceeded \nto expressly seek preliminary injunctive relief within the same bounds as the relief they sought and \nreceived at the TRO stage.  Plaintiffs cannot now seek “clarification” from the Court regarding an \nidentical instruction.  The Court has been clear regarding its definition of the term “open awards,” \nand Defendants’ written notice is entirely consistent with the Court’s definition and prior orders.  \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Motion Improperly Seeks to Materially Alter the Court’s Preliminary \nInjunction \n  Plaintiffs’  motion  also  fails  because  Plaintiffs  improperly  seek  to  use  a  motion  for \nclarification to “alter or amend” the Court’s order.  Philip Morris USA Inc., 793 F. Supp. at 168.  \nWhile Plaintiffs seek to portray their motion as merely requesting clarification regarding the term \n“open awards,” they are actually seeking an expansion of the Court’s preliminary injunction order, \nto require OMB’s instructions to address not only disbursement of funding but also additional \nactivities,  including  relating  to  obligation  of  funding—which  is  well  beyond  the  express \nboundaries of the Court’s order and the relief Plaintiffs previously stated they were requesting.  Id. \n(“The general purpose of a motion for clarification is . . . not to alter or amend.”).  \n  While the OMB Memo instructed federal agencies to temporarily pause activities relating \nto “obligation or disbursement” of federal financial assistance, OMB Memo at 2, the Court’s \npreliminary injunction order is clear that it applies only “with respect to the disbursement of \nFederal Funds under all open awards.”  ECF No. 52 at 1 (emphasis added).  And as discussed \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 17\nabove, at the preliminary injunction hearing, the Court specifically noted to Plaintiffs that at the \nadministrative stay and TRO stages “all we were focused on was the disbursement of monies under \nopen awards” and proceeded to ask if Plaintiffs were “seeking a PI as it goes to the NOFOs or sort \nof other aspects of the Memo.”  PI Hrg. Tr. at 19.  Plaintiffs responded that they were “still \nrequesting relief sort of within the bounds originally described at the TRO stage.”  Id.  In other \nwords, the Court asked if Plaintiffs were seeking a preliminary injunction as to aspects of the OMB \nMemo beyond the disbursement of monies under open awards, and Plaintiffs disclaimed any such \nbroader request. \n  Yet now, in their motion to clarify, Plaintiffs seek to expand the Court’s preliminary \ninjunctive relief not only to instructions regarding the disbursement of funding, but also to the \nobligation of funding.  This is made clear from the lone example Plaintiffs provide of a program \nin which grants have allegedly been awarded to Plaintiffs but for which funds have not yet been \ndisbursed—the HUD Continuum of Care program.  Plaintiffs attach a declaration that purports to \nidentify National Council of Nonprofits members who were awarded a Continuum of Care grant \nbut have not yet signed the grant agreement, and suggest that the Court’s order should be clarified \nto apply with respect to this circumstance.  See ECF No. 56-1 ¶¶ 7-8.  This amounts to a request \nfor the Court’s order to extend to non-disbursement activities, including the obligation of funding.  \nUnder  the  Continuum  of  Care  program,  HUD  announces  awards,  and  then  identifies  the \n“conditions” imposed on that award, and “notif[ies] selected applicant[]” of those conditions.  24 \nC.F.R. § 578.21(b).  Those “[c]onditions must be satisfied before HUD will execute a grant \nagreement with the applicant.”  Id.  Applicants must “correct[] all issues” and “conditions attached \nto an award must be completed within the timeframe established in the NOFA.”  Id. § 578.21(c).  \n“Proof of site control, match, environmental review, and the documentation of financial feasibility \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 12 of 17\nmust be completed within 12 months of the announcement of the award, or 24 months in the case \nof funds for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction.”  Id.  “HUD will withdraw an award \nif the applicant does not satisfy all conditions imposed on it.”  Id.  Only after conditions are \nsatisfied will the grant agreement be executed.  See id. § 578.21(b); see also id. § 578.23 (governing \nthe required Continuum of Care grant agreements, including the various terms recipients must \nagree to in the grant agreement).  Thus, after a Continuum of Care grant is awarded, there is a \nsignificant and potentially lengthy administrative process prior to the grant agreement being signed \nand the funds being obligated to the recipient.1  Given their use of this example, it is clear that \nPlaintiffs seek to use a motion to clarify to expand the Court’s order to enjoin OMB to issue \ninstructions to agencies not only with respect to disbursement of Federal funds, but also with \nrespect to these kinds of obligation activities.   \n  If there was any doubt that Plaintiffs seek to expand the Court’s order to the obligation of \nfunding, such doubt is extinguished by Plaintiffs’ proposed order.  Their proposed order would \nrequire Defendants to provide written notice instructing federal agencies that “they may not take \nany steps to implement, given effect to, or reinstate under a different name the unilateral, non-\nindividualized directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to all activities related to \nthe obligation or disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards, regardless of whether the \nfunds have been partially disbursed.”  ECF No. 56-2 at 1-2 (emphasis added).  Similarly, it would \nrequire Defendants to instruct federal agencies “to continue all activities related to obligating \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ discussion of the Village of Bensenville case actually underscores the breadth \nof the relief Plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish that case from Continuum of Care \nfunding on the grounds that the funding decision in Village of Bensenville “require[d] further \nadministrative process,” ECF No. 56 at 10 (quoting 457 F.3d at 69), ignoring the fact that disbursal \nof money under the Continuum of Care program requires “further administrative process” before \na grant agreement is signed. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 13 of 17\nand releasing any disbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-\n25-13.”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  The proposed order’s language regarding obligation activities \nwas not present in the Court’s preliminary injunction order, making clear that Plaintiffs seek to \nmaterially expand the scope of the Court’s order.   \nPlaintiffs’ motion offers little justification for this request for expanded relief.  Plaintiffs \nallude to this in a footnote, stating that the Court found likely unlawful a pause on “all activities \nrelated to obligation and disbursement” and asserting that includes “not only the actual payment \nof money but also other steps necessary for the ordinary obligation and disbursement” of funding.  \nECF No. 56 at 7 n.4.  But Plaintiffs ignore the fact that the Court’s order expressly applies only \nwith respect to “disbursement” of funding.  ECF No. 52 at 1.  There is no need to clarify whether \nthe Court’s order applied to obligation of funding, when it expressly did not.   \n  Plaintiffs’ attempt to expand this Court’s order to apply to obligation activities further \nhighlights the fact that Plaintiffs seek to use a single lawsuit against OMB—which they claim \nchallenged “specific final agency action,” ECF No. 49 at 12—to supervise countless individual \nfunding decisions by non-defendant agencies under the guise of ordering OMB to issue various \n“instructions” to agencies.  Indeed, when combined with the threat of contempt against the \ngovernment, Plaintiffs’ requested relief highlights that they are seeking to use this Court as a \nsuperintendent over Executive Branch decisions relating to the obligation of funding.  This would \ninclude superintending individual agency decisions such as the signing of grant agreements or the \ndetermination of whether applicants have satisfied conditions imposed on their awards.  See supra \n(discussing those pre-disbursement activities in relation to the Continuum of Care program).  That \nis especially troubling given that grant programs and individual grants often provide procedures \ndesigned to address concerns with, and provide any appropriate remedy regarding, administration \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 14 of 17\nof the grant.  See, e.g., 24 C.F.R. § 578.35 (setting forth procedures for appealing agency decisions \nregarding the Continuum of Care program).2  Such procedures would provide the proper remedy \nfor any individual claim for relief relating to these individual agency decisions regarding grants, \nrather than Plaintiffs improperly asking this Court to oversee such decisions under the guise of \nordering OMB to issue various “instructions” to agencies. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate Harm Caused by Defendants’ Instruction  \n  Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs were not seeking to alter or amend an unambiguous \norder of this Court, their request for clarification would fail because they provide no direct \nevidence that Defendants’ instruction harms them and therefore no reason that clarification is \nnecessary. \n  To  begin  with,  Plaintiffs  affirmatively  represented  to  the  Court  that  its  temporary \nrestraining order—for which Defendants issued an identical instruction regarding the definition of \n“open awards”—provided them with the relief they sought.  Indeed, in their February 11, 2025 \nmotion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs stated that after they “complained that the OMB \nMemo froze the disbursement of open grant awards,” “[t]his Court entered the relief Plaintiffs \nsought and those funds began flowing again.”  ECF No. 40 at 33 n.10; see also ECF No. 49 at 20 \n(asserting that “declarants can now draw on their open awards” and alleging they “received relief \nonly because this Court ordered it”).  Plaintiffs reiterated this at the February 20, 2025 preliminary \ninjunction hearing, informing the Court that “the TRO has had a real effect for our clients in getting \ntheir members access to funding that they’re entitled to under open awards.”  PI Hrg. Tr. at 4.  \n \n2 In addition, in the event that an entity does have a grant agreement with a federal agency, \ndepending on the particular instrument, some claims regarding that grant might proceed under the \nTucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), which provides the Court of Federal Claims with exclusive \njurisdiction over breach claims for express or implied contracts where the amount in controversy \nexceeds $10,000. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 15 of 17\nAccording to Plaintiffs, after the Court entered the temporary restraining order, Defendants’ actions \n“threaten[ed] to harm them, but for the temporary restraining order holding it at bay.”  ECF No. \n49 at 20 n.9.   \nPlaintiffs now allege that certain members of the National Council of Nonprofits are being \nharmed by Defendants’ instruction regarding the definition of “open awards,” because they were \nallegedly awarded Continuum of Care grants and funds have not been disbursed.  ECF No. 56 at \n5-7; see also ECF No. 56-1.  Given that Defendants’ prior written notice with an identical \ninstruction regarding the definition of “open awards” was adequate to “hol[d] [harm to Plaintiffs] \nat bay,” ECF No. 49 at 20 n.9, Plaintiffs cannot now claim that they would be irreparably harmed \nin  the  absence  of  clarification  (and  expansion)  of  the  Court’s  preliminary  injunction.    See \nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (any alleged \nirreparable harm “must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical” and it must \nbe of such “imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief” (emphasis in \noriginal)).   \n  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ motion does not provide any direct evidence of Plaintiffs being \nharmed.  Instead, Plaintiffs rely wholly on a declaration from the President and CEO of the \nNational  Council  of  Nonprofits  which  purports  to  recount  the  circumstances  surrounding \nanonymous members’ Continuum of Care grants.  See ECF No. 56-1.  Not only is Plaintiffs’ \ndeclaration hearsay, but it merely makes generalized allegations of harm allegedly stemming from \nDefendants’ instructions, speculating about potential harm to Continuum of Care grant recipients \nbased simply on the declarant’s “experience working with nonprofits.”  ECF No. 56-1 ¶ 9; see also \nid. ¶ 8 (speculating regarding what could happen to another individual “if [that individual] is not \nable to obtain gap funding from another source”).  Such generalized hearsay is inadequate to satisfy \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 16 of 17\nthe “high standard for irreparable harm” required by the D.C. Circuit, Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297, \nand therefore cannot justify an expansion of the scope of the Court’s preliminary injunction. \n  Furthermore, even if Plaintiffs had adequately alleged harm to certain Continuum of Care \napplicants, they have failed to provide anything more than speculation that such harm is caused by \nthe rescinded OMB Memo, rather than by independent decisions of HUD (which is not a defendant \nin this case) or other relevant circumstances.  Plaintiffs make no effort to show that any alleged \npause or delay in HUD’s processing of grant agreements is attributable to the OMB Memo.  And \ntheir own allegations suggest otherwise, since the relevant Plaintiff members were awarded \nContinuum of Care grants on January 17, 2025—well before the January 27, 2025 issuance of the \nOMB Memo—and they apparently did not receive disbursement of funding in the meantime.  See \nECF No. 56 at 6; see also ECF No. 56-1 ¶¶ 6-7.  Plaintiffs do not acknowledge or explain why \nthese Plaintiff members did not sign a grant agreement and receive disbursements prior to the \nissuance of the OMB Memo.  Nor do they address whether or when they have even satisfied the \nconditions required in order to sign a Continuum of Care grant agreement.  See 24 C.F.R.  \n§ 578.21(b) (“Conditions must be satisfied before HUD will execute a grant agreement with the \napplicant.”); see also id. § 578.23(a) (providing that a grant agreement will be executed within 45 \ndays from “the date when all conditions are satisfied”).  Plaintiffs merely speculate that any delay \nthey might experience regarding grant funding must be attributable to the rescinded OMB Memo.  \nThis is inadequate to justify preliminary injunctive relief as to these circumstances.  See Wisc. Gas \nCo. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (to demonstrate irreparable harm, plaintiffs must \nshow “that the alleged harm will directly result from the action which the movant seeks to enjoin”).  \nIt also underscores again that Plaintiffs seek to improperly use this lawsuit against OMB to \nsuperintend the Executive Branch’s countless funding decisions—which they appear to simply \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 57     Filed 03/07/25     Page 17 of 17\nassume are a consequence of the rescinded OMB Memo and subject to motions practice in this \ncase. \nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs’ motion to clarify the scope of preliminary injunction should be denied. \n \nDated: March 7, 2025         Respectfully Submitted,     \n       \n              YAAKOV M.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 1 of 11\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \nNATIONAL COUNCIL OF   \nNONPROFITS, et al., \n    \nPlaintiffs, \n      Case No. 25-cv-239 \nv. \n    \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND \nBUDGET, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF  \nMOTION TO CLARIFY SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nThis Court has preliminarily enjoined Defendants from implementing, giving \neffect to, or reinstating under a different name the unilateral, non-individualized \ndirectives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal \nfunds  under  all  open  awards.    Because  Defendants  have  applied  a  narrow \nconstruction to this injunction—at odds with both the text and animating principles \nof this Court’s opinion—clarification is warranted to confirm that the injunction \napplies to federal funds that have been awarded, regardless of whether disbursement \nhas  begun.    Defendants  offer  no  substantive  rationale  to  support  their  crabbed \nreading, and their procedural arguments are without basis. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs filed a motion to clarify. \n  As Plaintiffs made clear in their opening brief, they understand the Court’s \norder “with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards,” ECF \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 2 of 11\nNo. 52, at 1, to encompass all federal financial assistance that has been awarded.  \nDefendants chose to adopt a limiting construction of “open awards” in their notice to \nagencies, stating that “open awards” means those that have already been “partially \ndisbursed.”  ECF No. 54-1, at 1.  This parties’ dispute, then, is over the proper \ninterpretation  of  the  order  this  Court  has  already  entered.    A  motion  for \nclarification—such as Plaintiffs filed—is the correct vehicle to ensure that all parties \nshare the Court’s understanding of its order. \n  Defendants, in arguing otherwise (at 8), suggest that there is no possible \nambiguity, and therefore nothing to clarify.  They base this view not on a refutation \nof the many points Plaintiffs made in their opening brief, but rather on an intimation \nthat there is some sort of unwritten statute of limitations on asking for clarification.  \nDefendants’ argument, boiled down, is that because an opinion that is no longer in \neffect contained a single line that Defendants plucked out of context, and Plaintiffs \ndid not raise a fuss then (over the precise contours of relief that would last only days \nmore), they are forever barred from seeking relief.1  But Plaintiffs are not asking for \n \n1 It is ironic that Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs have waived their argument, \nwhen Defendants seek to rely (at 13–14 & n.2) for the first time on arguments that \nagency appeal processes or the Tucker Act are the proper remedies for Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  In any event, it is unclear why Defendants believe these remedies are \nrelevant here.  Defendants point to 24 C.F.R. § 578.35, which sets forth an appeal \nprocess regarding the CoC grants.  But that section is clear that “who may appeal” is \nlimited to entities that “believe they were denied the right to participate” in a CoC \nplanning  process;  those  that  were  denied  funding  or  received  less  than  they \nrequested; those that received a lower score in their geographic area; and those that \ndid not receive a certification of consistency.  Unsurprisingly, none of these options \nappear to apply to grantees who were awarded grants, but have since had those \nawarded grants frozen at the behest of OMB on a non-individualized basis.  As to the \nTucker Act, it does not provide for jurisdiction for the APA claims at issue here.  It is \ntelling that Defendants believe that they have the authority to turn off the spigot of \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 3 of 11\nclarification of that TRO opinion; they are asking for clarification of the preliminary \ninjunction—an order that is currently operative, and will be for a much longer \nduration.  Plaintiffs requested clarification a mere two business days after it became \nclear that Defendants are advancing a position that is inconsistent with that order \nand opinion. \n  Defendants  further  suggest  (at  9–10,  11)  that  Plaintiffs  have  somehow \nconceded the limiting construction that Defendants have chosen to adopt.  But the \nstatements they cite only support Plaintiffs’ position.  Defendants are quite correct \nthat, at the PI hearing, Plaintiffs reiterated that they seek relief for open awards, and \nnot for NOFOs.  That is still the case.  As Plaintiffs explain in their opening brief, \n“open  awards”  should,  properly  understood,  encompass  awards  that  have  been \nawarded—which are quite dissimilar from NOFOs, where no particular grantee has \nbeen selected, as the reliance interests are not comparable.  Defendants do not offer \nany explanation to the contrary.2 \n  Instead, Defendants fixate (at 5–6, 14–15) on Plaintiffs’ statements at the \npreliminary injunction stage that the TRO had provided significant relief, as the \n \nfederal  funding  with  one  ill-conceived,  two-page  memorandum  issued  without \nnotice—but that to get the funding turned back on, every single grantee in the United \nStates  should  have  to  file  an  individual  lawsuit  to  vindicate  their  rights.    If \nDefendants’  proposal  were  to  bear  out,  it  would  result  in  precisely  the  Court \nsupervision over every grant or contract that Defendants purport to fear. \n2 In their efforts (at 9, 12 n.1) to rehabilitate their reliance on Village of Bensenville \nv. Federal Aviation Administration, 457 F.3d 52 (D.C. Cir. 2006), Defendants ignore \nthe facts that in Bensenville—unlike here—the hopeful grant recipient had not even \nfiled the requisite grant application, and the funds for the grant had not even been \ncongressionally appropriated. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 4 of 11\ndeclarants at the TRO stage had since been able to draw on their open awards.  These \nstatements are true.  But the fact that some of Plaintiffs’ members did secure relief \nas a result of this Court’s TRO does not mean that the same is necessarily true for \nevery one of the more than 83,000 members Plaintiffs represent.  See ECF No. 5-3 \n¶ 2;  ECF No.5-4 ¶ 1;  ECF No.  5-5,  ¶ 2.    And Plaintiffs  noted  just  that  at  the \npreliminary injunction stage.  E.g. ECF No. 40, at 9 (“Since the Court’s order, it \nappears that the freeze has mostly—but not entirely—thawed.” (emphasis added)); \nECF No. 49, at 11 n.4 (explaining that “it is far from clear that, even now, the rippling \neffects of the Freeze Order have stopped”); Tr. of Prelim. Inj. H’rg at 3 (noting that \nthe “[u]nfreezing of funds” had been “imperfect and incomplete”).  The time since then \nhas only cast additional light on the problems caused by Defendants’ actions first in \ncarelessly and recklessly freezing federal financial assistance and now in seeking to \nlimit the reach of the Court’s order. \n  Defendants complain (at 12–13) that Plaintiffs seek to introduce new words \ninto the Court’s order.  But the Court’s order already encompasses the relief Plaintiffs \nseek.  By its terms, it bars implementation of the “unilateral, non-individualized \ndirectives” in the Freeze Order “with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds \nunder all open awards.”  ECF No. 52, at 1 (emphasis added).  That language easily \nencompasses the ministerial steps that lead to the disbursement of federal funds that \nhave  already  been  awarded.    The  fact  that  Plaintiffs  proposed  some  clarifying \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 5 of 11\nlanguage in response to Defendants’ improperly narrowed interpretation of the order \nhardly means that they seek a modification.3 \nII.  The motion to clarify should be granted. \n  As  Plaintiffs  have  explained,  the  preliminary  injunction  analysis  applies \nequally to grants that have been awarded but not disbursed as to other open grants.  \nBecause both the reasoning of the Court’s decision and order and those documents’ \nexpress  terms—enjoining  the  continued  implementation  of  “the  unilateral,  non-\nindividualized  directives  in  OMB  Memorandum  M-25-13  with  respect  to  the \ndisbursement of Federal funds under all open awards,” ECF No. 52, at 1 (emphasis \nadded)—apply  to  all  activities  (not  just  disbursement  itself)  concerning  the \ndisbursement of all open awards (not just open awards that have been partially \ndisbursed), the Court should grant the requested motion to clarify. \nSeeking to avoid that conclusion, Defendants suggest that, before Plaintiffs can \nask  the  Court  to  clarify  its  order,  Plaintiffs  must  submit  additional  evidence \ndocumenting additional harm beyond what is already in the record.  But Defendants \nhave identified no authority for that proposition; indeed, the only cases they cite (at \n \n3 Even if this Court were inclined to deem Plaintiffs’ motion as one for modification—\nand it should not, because the Court’s order, properly understood, already covers \nawards that have been granted—the motion should still be granted because, for the \nreasons already discussed, “the requested modification effectuates . . . the purpose \nbehind the injunction.” New York v. Biden, Case No. 20-2340, 2021 WL 7908124, at \n*2 (D.D.C. Aug. 23, 2021); see also id. (“modification is appropriate when enforcement \nwithout modification would be detrimental to the public interest”) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Nor would modification require showing “a significant \nchange either in factual conditions or in law” in these circumstances, id., because it \nis Plaintiffs—not Defendants—who would be seeking the modification, cf. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b) (setting out conditions under which a court may “relieve a party” from a \njudgment or order).  \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 6 of 11\n15–16) relay—unremarkably—that to achieve a preliminary injunction (or stay) in \nthe first place, plaintiffs must show irreparable harm.  As this Court has twice \nconcluded, Plaintiffs here have done so “easily.”  See ECF No. 30, at 26–28; ECF No. \n51, at 35–37.  Because a motion to clarify simply asks this Court to reiterate the \ncontours of relief it has already granted, Plaintiffs need not make any additional \nfactual showing.    \nEven if Plaintiffs did need to produce evidence of harm specifically related to \nthe Continuum of Care (CoC) grants they highlight in their motion—and they do \nnot—they have already done so in the form of a declaration from the NCN President \nand CEO detailing the irreparable harm that will befall NCN’s members if awarded \nCoC funding is not disbursed.  See, e.g., ECF No. 56-1 ¶ 8 (noting that 129 households, \nincluding 82 children, could lose their housing).  Defendants (at 15) brush this \ndeclaration  away  as  hearsay—conveniently  neglecting  to  note  that,  at  the \npreliminary injunction stage, hearsay is permissible.  See Holiday CVS, LLC v. \nHolder, 839 F. Supp. 2d 145, 155 (D.D.C.), vacated and remanded on other grounds, \n493 F. App’x 108 (D.C. Cir. 2012).4 \n  To the extent any doubt remains, Plaintiffs now concurrently submit further \nevidence of the irreparable harm caused by Defendants’ erroneous reading of the \n \n4 In deeming the declaration hearsay, Defendants also fail to grapple with the fact \nthat the declaration was explicitly based on the declarant’s “personal knowledge and \nreview of NCN business records.”  ECF No. 56-1 ¶ 2.  See United States v. Dynamic \nVisions,  Inc.,  282  F.  Supp.  3d  257,  260  (D.D.C.  2017)  (finding  a  declaration \n“competent,  reliable,  non-hearsay  evidence  from  a  witness  who  was  personally \ninvolved in reviewing . . . business records”), vacated and remanded on other grounds, \n971 F.3d 330 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 7 of 11\nCourt’s order.  As the attached declarations show, one of Plaintiffs’ CoC members was \nawarded  five  CoC  grant  renewals  on  January  17,  but  has  received  no  further \ncommunications about those awards since they were publicly announced.  Ex. U ¶ 4.  \nAs that member explained, their organization has planned their 2025 budget in \nreliance on those awards, id. ¶ 5, and if they do not come through as promised, will \nhave to lay off staff, diminishing the level of service the organization can offer, id. \n¶ 6.  These cuts will particularly affect the organization’s permanent supportive \nhousing program, which will lead to “more people . . . back in the cycle of street \nhomelessness and shelters.”  Id. ¶ 8. \nAnother of Plaintiffs’ CoC members was awarded two CoC grants on January \n17, but they remain paused.  See Ex. V ¶ 6.  If the funding does not come through as \npromised, that member will have to close a program to match data with Medicaid to \nhelp enroll clients not receiving mainstream benefits.  Id. ¶ 7.  That member will also \nhave to shutter a coordinated entry program that helps ensure people experiencing \nhomelessness  can  access  services  in  a  much  more  streamlined  way  and  allows \ncommunities to collectively prioritize referrals based on vulnerability.  Id. ¶ 8.  As \nthat member explained, losing the two employees who run these programs—because \nHUD froze the funds it had awarded, and on which the member relied—would mean \nthat the member “will not be able to provide services at the same level [they] currently \ndo.”  Id. ¶ 9.  And the freeze on CoC funding will have broader effects:  it will result \nin  the  removal  of  individuals  from  permanent  housing  programs,  which  will \noverburden already inadequately funded shelters.  Id. ¶ 13.  Even now, the member \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 8 of 11\n“still see[s] loss of life year after year due to exposure to the elements”; the freeze on \nCoC funding “will unequivocally lead to more deaths.”  Id.  As the member explained: \n“Our clients have no options whatsoever.  I can’t even fathom what that is going to \nlook like, but it will be absolutely devastating.”  Id. ¶ 12. \nIn disputing that the motion should be granted, Defendants also reprise (at 2, \n13, 16) the refrain that clarification will require this Court to superintend individual \nagency decisions.  But that is wrong and provides no basis for denial.  As Plaintiffs \nhave made clear (at 5, 10), the delay in CoC grants is merely an exemplar of the \nproblem Defendants have created through their unduly crabbed interpretation of this \nCourt’s  order—albeit  a  particularly  significant  and  costly  one,  with  devastating \nconsequences for NCN’s members.  Plaintiffs do not ask this Court to superintend \nevery decision regarding a grant by every agency.  Indeed, the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint is that the agencies are not making individual decisions about each grant, \nbut instead continuing to follow a sweeping directive from OMB that encompasses all \nfederal financial assistance other than Medicare or Social Security.  This motion \nconcerns the interpretation of the Court’s preliminary injunction that Defendants \nhave adopted and instructed other agencies to follow.  There is nothing unusual or \nobjectionable about the Court clarifying its preliminary injunction order. \nWith respect to some CoC grants in particular, Defendants (at 11–12) make \nmuch of HUD regulations noting that certain conditions must be satisfied before a \ngrant agreement is signed.  But “the process of signing a grant agreement is fairly \nministerial:  it is not a negotiation about the amount awarded or the fact of the award \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 9 of 11\nitself.”  Ex. W ¶ 8.  Because the grant agreement process “is not intended to afford \nHUD a process to revisit its decision to award the grant[, a]warded renewals almost \nnever fall through after the award is announced.”  Id.  (This is particularly true for \nrenewals,  which  usually  do  not  have  additional  conditions  that  need  to  be  met \nbecause their compliance was reviewed before the renewal was even awarded.  Id.)  \nAnd in any event, there are no conditions that a grantee needs to meet between the \nannouncement of the award and the receipt of the individual award letter.  Id. ¶ 6. \nDefendants further suggest (at 3, 16) that the fault may lie with the grantees \nfor  failing  to  sign  their  grant  agreements.    This  cannot  be  taken  seriously.    A \nsignificant part of the problem is that—because of the OMB-directed freeze still in \nplace—grant agreements have not even been distributed to the awardees.  See Ex. U \n¶ 4; Ex. V ¶ 6; Ex. W ¶ 11.   Yet Defendants contend (at 16) that any delay must not \nbe related to the OMB Freeze Order because Plaintiffs’ members were awarded \ngrants on January 17, and had not received their first disbursement before the Freeze \nOrder issued ten days later.  This, too, reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of \nthe typical timeline and process for CoC grant award disbursements.  See Ex. W ¶ 6.  \nIn the ordinary course, grantees would not have received their first disbursement in \nten days.  Id.  But the fact that grantees have heard only radio silence since January \n17 is not in the ordinary course.  Id.  Pausing the steps necessary to begin disbursing \nCoC  awards  at  precisely  the  same  time  the  Freeze  Order  issued  “would  be  a \nremarkable—and unfathomable—coincidence.”  ECF No. 51, at 13.5      \n \n5 Although Defendants are incorrect about the CoC grants, this discussion is, in many \nways, a sideshow.  Plaintiffs understand that the Freeze Order is affecting not only \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 58     Filed 03/10/25     Page 10 of 11\nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  should  clarify  that  the  preliminary \ninjunction’s directive “with respect to the disbursement of all open awards” applies to \nfederal financial assistance that has been awarded, and directing that Defendants \nclarify and reissue their notice to agencies accordingly. \n \nDated:  March 10, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Jessica Anne Morton \nJessica Anne Morton (DC Bar No. 1032316) \nKevin E.

Vaeth, Acting Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget (“OMB”), issued a memorandum (“M-25-13”) directing federal agencies to “complete a \ncomprehensive analysis of all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, \nprojects, and activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders.”  ECF \nNo. 1 ¶ 15.  The memorandum further required agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related \nto [the] obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency \nacti[vities] that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial \nassistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the \ngreen new deal.”  Id. ¶ 16 (emphasis omitted); Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Off. of the President, \nTemporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, \n2025), https://perma.cc/69QB-VFG8.   \nThe memorandum defines “Federal financial assistance” as: “(i) all forms of assistance \nlisted in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of this term at 2 [C.F.R. §] 200.1; and (ii) assistance \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 13     Filed 01/28/25     Page 2 of 5\nreceived or administered by recipients or subrecipients of any type except for assistance received \ndirectly by individuals.”  Id. ¶ 17.  This includes all federal assistance in the form of grants, loans, \nloan guarantees, and insurance.  Id. ¶ 18; see 2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  As relevant executive orders, it \nlists:  \n•  Protecting the American People Against Invasion (Jan. 20, 2025); \n•  Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid (Jan. 20, 2025);  \n•  Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements (Jan. 20, 2025);  \n•  Unleashing American Energy (Jan. 20, 2025);  \n•  Ending  Radical  and  Wasteful  Government  DEI  Programs  and  Preferencing \n(Jan. 20, 2025); \n•  Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological \nTruth to the Federal Government (Jan. 20, 2025); and  \n•  Enforcing the Hyde Amendment (Jan. 24, 2025).   \nTemporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs, at 1-2. \nOMB’s “temporary pause” was set to take effect on January 28, 2025, at 5:00 p.m.  ECF \nNo. 1 ¶ 21.  The same day, several coalitions of nonprofit organizations brought this action against \nOMB and Acting Director Vaeth arguing that OMB’s action violates the Administrative Procedure \nAct (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.  ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs allege that the implicated federal grants \nand funding “are the lifeblood of operations and programs for many . . . nonprofits, and even a \nshort pause in funding . . . could deprive people and communities of their life-saving services.”  \nId. ¶ 32.  They argue that Defendants’ action was arbitrary and capricious, violates the First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, and exceeded OMB’s statutory authority.  Id. \n¶¶ 43-61.  \nAlong with their complaint, Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order “barring the \nOMB and all of its officers, employees, and agents from taking any steps to implement, apply, or \nenforce Memo M-25-13.”  ECF No. 5, at 18.  Defendants entered an appearance, ECF No. 9, and \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 13     Filed 01/28/25     Page 3 of 5\nthe court held an emergency hearing to discern the parties’ positions with respect to the issuance \nof  a  brief  administrative  stay  pending  the  resolution  of  Plaintiffs’  request  for  a  temporary \nrestraining order, Minute Order (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025).   \nThe purpose of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction is to preserve the \nstatus quo while the court considers the merits of the case.  M.G.U. v. Nielsen, 316 F. Supp. 3d 518, \n520 (D.D.C. 2018) (temporary restraining order); Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (preliminary injunction).  “The status quo is the last uncontested \nstatus which preceded the pending controversy.”  Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (citing Dist. 50, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Int’l Union, United Mine Workers \nof Am., 412 F.2d 165, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1969)).  To secure a temporary restraining order, “the moving \nparty must show (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer \nirreparable injury if the injunction were not granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially \ninjure other interested parties, and (4) that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  \nEngland, 454 F.3d at 297; Council on Am.-Islamic Rels. v. Gaubatz, 667 F. Supp. 2d 67, 74 \n(D.D.C. 2009) (temporary restraining order).1  Given the weighty legal issues in this case, and to \nproperly evaluate the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion, the court will require full briefing from the \nparties and a motions hearing. \nWhile the court awaits full briefing and argument, it may issue a brief “administrative stay.”  \nUnited States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) (Barrett, J., concurring).  An administrative stay \n“buys the court time to deliberate” when issues are not “easy to evaluate in haste.”  Id.  An \n \n1 Additionally, the APA permits a court to stay administrative action when necessary “to preserve \nstatus or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The considerations \nfor a stay under Section 705 mirror those for a temporary restraining order.  Texas v. Biden, 646 \nF. Supp. 3d 753, 771 (N.D. Tex. 2022). \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 13     Filed 01/28/25     Page 4 of 5\n“[a]dministrative stay[] do[es] not typically reflect the court’s consideration of the merits,” but \ninstead “reflects a first-blush judgment about the relative consequences” of the case.  Id.  Such a \nstay “freeze[s] legal proceedings until the court can rule on a party’s request for expedited relief.”  \nId. (quoting Rachel Bayefsky, Administrative Stays: Power and Procedure, 97 Notre Dame L. Rev. \n1941, 1942 (2022)).  While administrative stays are more common in appellate courts, district \ncourts have recognized their applicability in cases seeking emergency relief under the APA.  See \nOrder, Texas v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 24-CV-306 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2024); Chef Time \n1520 LLC v. Small Bus. Admin., No. 22-CV-3587 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2022).  As these courts have \nrecognized, “[t]he authority for an administrative stay arises from the All Writs Act and a court’s \ninherent authority to manage its docket.”  Order, Texas, No. 24-CV-306, at 2.   \nHowever, because an administrative stay in this case blocks executive action—a consideration \nthat is not to be taken lightly—the court will limit its duration to only the few days it will take for \nexpedited briefing and a hearing.  It will further limit the scope of the administrative stay to OMB’s \ndirection that agencies “pause . . . disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards,” so that it \nis tailored to Plaintiffs’ concern that a lapse in existing federal funding will cause irreparable injuries \nto recipients and their programs.  See ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 31-42; see Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, \nLoan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs, at 2.  In this way, the administrative stay does \nnot affect OMB’s memorandum as it pertains to “issuance of new awards” or “other relevant agency \nactions that may be implicated by the executive orders.”  Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, \nand Other Financial Assistance Programs, at 2. \nAccordingly, to maintain the status quo until the court may rule on Plaintiffs’ motion, it is \nhereby ORDERED that an ADMINISTRATIVE STAY is entered in this case until 5:00 p.m. at \nFebruary 3, 2025.  During the pendency of the stay, Defendants shall refrain from implementing \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 13     Filed 01/28/25     Page 5 of 5\nOMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open \nawards. \nIt is further ORDERED that Defendants shall respond to Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary \nrestraining order by 5:00 p.m. on January 30, 2025, and Plaintiffs shall file a reply, if any, by \n5:00 p.m. on January 31, 2025.   \nIt is further ORDERED that the parties shall convene for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion \nat 11:00 a.m. on February 3, 2025, in Courtroom 21.   \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \nLOREN L.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA.  Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-13 \nOn January 27, 2025, Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget (“OMB”), issued a memorandum (“M-25-13”) directing federal agencies to “complete a \ncomprehensive analysis of all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, \nprojects, and activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders.”  ECF \nNo. 1 ¶ 15.  The memorandum further stated that, “[i]n the interim, to the extent permissible under \napplicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 2 of 30\ndisbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency acti[vities] that may be \nimplicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign \naid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.”  Id. \n¶ 16; Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Off. of the President, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, \nLoan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, 2025), https://perma.cc/69QB-VFG8 \n(“OMB Pause Memorandum”).   \nThe memorandum defined “Federal financial assistance” as: “(i) all forms of assistance \nlisted in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of this term at 2 [C.F.R. §] 200.1; and (ii) assistance \nreceived or administered by recipients or subrecipients of any type except for assistance received \ndirectly by individuals.”  Id. ¶ 17.  This includes all federal assistance in the form of grants, loans, \nloan guarantees, and insurance.  Id. ¶ 18; see 2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  As relevant executive orders, it \nlisted: \n▪  Protecting the American People Against Invasion (Jan. 20, 2025); \n▪  Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid (Jan. 20, 2025);  \n▪  Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements (Jan. 20, 2025); \n▪  Unleashing American Energy (Jan. 20, 2025); \n▪  Ending  Radical  and  Wasteful  Government  DEI  Programs  and  Preferencing \n(Jan. 20, 2025);  \n▪  Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth \nto the Federal Government (Jan. 20, 2025); and  \n▪  Enforcing the Hyde Amendment (Jan. 24, 2025).  \nOMB Pause Memorandum, at 1-2. \nThe  memorandum  stated  that  “[t]he  temporary  pause  [would]  become  effective  on \nJanuary 28, 2025 at 5:00 PM.”  Id. at 2.  During the pause, agencies were directed to “submit to \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 3 of 30\nOMB detailed information on any programs, projects[,] or activities subject to [the] pause” on or \nbefore February 10, 2025.  Id. at 2.   \nB.   Complaint, Emergency Hearing, and Administrative Stay \nShortly after noon on January 28, several coalitions of nonprofit organizations brought this \naction against OMB and Acting Director Vaeth arguing that OMB’s action violated the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.  ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs alleged that the implicated \nfederal grants and funding “are the lifeblood of operations and programs for many . . . nonprofits, \nand [that] even a short pause in funding . . . could deprive people and communities of their life-\nsaving services.”  Id. ¶ 32.  They argue that Defendants’ action was arbitrary and capricious, \nviolated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and exceeded OMB’s statutory \nauthority.  Id. ¶¶ 43-61.   \nAlong with their complaint, Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) “barring \nthe OMB and all of its officers, employees, and agents from taking any steps to implement, apply, \nor enforce Memo M-25-13.”  ECF No. 5, at 18.  Defendants entered an appearance, ECF No. 9, \nand the court held an emergency hearing at 4:00 p.m. on January 28 to discern the parties’ positions \nwith respect to the issuance of a brief administrative stay pending the resolution of Plaintiffs’ request \nfor a TRO, Minute Order (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025). \nGiven the extreme time constraints of the litigation and the magnitude of the legal issues, \nthe court entered a brief administrative stay to permit the parties to fully brief the TRO motion and \n“buy[] the court time to deliberate.”1  ECF No. 13, at 3 (quoting United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. \n \n1 The court issued the administrative stay from the bench shortly before 5:00 p.m., when the \n“temporary pause” of federal funding was set to take effect.  Transcript of Emergency Hearing, \nNat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C.

The administrative stay prohibited Defendants “from \nimplementing OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds \nunder all open awards” until 5:00 p.m. on February 3, 2025.  Id. at 4-5.  The court also set a hearing \non Plaintiffs’ TRO motion for 11:00 a.m. on February 3, 2025.  Id. at 5. \nC.  Rescission of Memorandum M-25-13 and Aftermath \nOn January 29, the day after the court entered its administrative stay, OMB issued a new \nmemorandum (“M-25-14”) that purported to rescind M-25-13.  See ECF Nos. 18, 18-1.  The new \nmemorandum consisted of two sentences: “OMB Memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded.  If you have \nquestions about implementing the President’s Executive Orders, please contact your agency General \nCounsel.”  ECF No. 18-1.   \nShortly after this “rescission” was issued, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt \nannounced from her official social media account that the new memorandum was “NOT a \nrescission of the federal funding freeze.”  Karoline Leavitt, X (formerly Twitter) (Jan. 29, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/99C4-5V6G.  Instead, she stated that “[i]t [was] simply a rescission of [OMB \nmemorandum M-25-13].”  Id.  She further explained that the purpose of the rescission was “[t]o \nend any confusion created by the court’s injunction.”  Id.

ECF Nos. 20, 21.  As of \nFebruary 1, both motions were fully briefed.  ECF Nos. 24, 25, 26.   \nD.  Temporary Restraining Order Hearing \nOn the morning of February 3, 2025, the court held a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \nTRO.  See Minute Entry, (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court \nexplained that it was inclined to grant a TRO and deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Oral \nArgument, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, \n2025).  Pursuant to the court’s request, Plaintiffs submitted a proposed TRO order shortly after the \nhearing concluded, and Defendants responded to the proposed order by mid-afternoon. \nE.  Parallel Litigation in the District of Rhode Island \nOn the same day Plaintiffs filed this suit, and several hours before memorandum M-25-13’s \npause was to go into effect, twenty-two states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island and sought a TRO to halt implementation of the \nmemorandum.  See Compl., New York v. Trump, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 28, 2025), ECF No. 1.  \nThe district court scheduled a hearing for January 29 at 3:00 p.m.   \nFollowing the hearing, which took place after OMB had “rescinded” memorandum M-25-13, \nthe court granted the States’ request and issued a TRO on January 31, 2025.  TRO, New York, \nNo. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025), ECF No. 50.  The restraining order prohibited the defendants \n(President Trump, OMB, and eleven federal agencies) from “paus[ing], freez[ing], imped[ing], \nblock[ing], cancel[ing], or terminat[ing] [their] compliance with awards and obligations to provide \nfederal financial assistance to the [plaintiff] States.”  Id. at 11.  The order also prohibited the \ndefendants “from reissuing, adopting, implementing, or otherwise giving effect to the [OMB \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 6 of 30\nmemorandum M-25-13] under any other name or title, . . . such as the continued implementation \nidentified by the White House Press Secretary’s statement of January 29, 2025.”  Id. at 12.  Finally, \nthe court directed the plaintiff States to file their forthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction \nexpeditiously.  Id. at 11.   \nOn the morning of February 3, the defendants filed a notice of compliance with the court’s \nTRO.  Notice of Compliance with Court’s TRO, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 3, 2025), \nECF No. 51.  In it, the defendants explained that they had provided written notice to all defendant \nagencies on January 31 to inform them of the TRO and instruct them to comply with its restrictions.  \nId. ¶ 1.  The defendants also notified the court that they believed certain terms of the TRO \n“constitute[d]  significant  intrusions  on  the  Executive  Branch’s  lawful  authorities  and  the \nseparation of powers.”  Id. ¶ 2. \nThe litigation remains ongoing.   \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Jurisdiction \nBefore reaching the merits, Defendants raise two threshold jurisdictional arguments.  First, \nthey argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not adequately alleged injury in fact, \ncausation, or redressability.  ECF No. 21-1, at 7-11.  Second, they claim that the case is now moot \nbecause OMB rescinded memorandum M-25-13 after Plaintiffs filed suit.  Id. at 6.  The court is \nunpersuaded on both counts.    \n1.  Standing \nA plaintiff seeking relief in federal court must establish standing by showing: (1) that it \nsuffered an injury in fact, which is a concrete and particularized harm that is actual or imminent, \nrather than hypothetical, (2) a causal connection between the injury and the challenged conduct \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 7 of 30\nthat is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions, and (3) a non-speculative likelihood that the injury \nwill be redressed by a decision in the plaintiff’s favor.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n560-61 (1992).  Standing is “assessed as of the time a suit commences,” meaning that post-\ncomplaint events will not deprive a plaintiff of standing.  Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. \nEPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy all three \nelements of standing.  The court disagrees. \na.  Injury in fact \nWhen a plaintiff association tries to sue on behalf of its members, it must demonstrate that: \n“(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks \nto protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the \nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”2  Metro. Wash. \nChapter, Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. District of Columbia, 62 F.4th 567, 572 (D.C. \nCir. 2023) (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  When \nfacing a motion to dismiss, an association plaintiff “need only make a plausible allegation of facts \nestablishing each element of standing.”  Cutler v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 797 F.3d \n1173, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 2015).   \nDefendants claim that Plaintiffs have failed to “identif[y] a single member who . . . would \nbe injured,” ECF No. 21-1, at 9 (quoting Chamber of Commerce, 642 F.3d at 200), but that is \nincorrect.  Plaintiffs allege that even a temporary pause in funding to their members, such as the \nAmerican Public Health Association and Main Street Alliance, would destroy their ability to \nprovide medical and low-income childcare services.  ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 33-34, 36-40.  On top of these \n \n2 Defendants do not contest prongs (b) or (c).  See ECF No. 24, at 18 n.11. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 8 of 30\neconomic injuries, Plaintiffs’ members face First Amendment harms because the memorandum \ntargets funds that relate to “DEI [and] woke gender ideology.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2; \nECF No. 1 ¶¶ 35-36, 42.  Defendants reply that Plaintiffs “must present more than allegations of a \nsubjective chill” and need to allege “present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  \nECF No. 26, at 3 (quoting Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 816-17 (1975)).  At this early stage, \nPlaintiffs have done exactly that: they claim that Defendants have singled out their funding \nprograms  (in  other  words,  their  economic  lifelines)  based  on  their  exercise  of  speech  and \nassociation.   \nDefendants further argue that a temporary pause would be far too brief to cause lasting \ndamage, but the record belies these claims.  First, Defendants have no factual basis on which to \nbuild such a counterargument.  The pause outlined in memorandum M-25-13 is effectively indefinite \nwith no clear parameters for when it will end.  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.  Second, Plaintiffs \nhave provided numerous declarations showing that many organizations need weekly injections of \nfederal funds in order to continue operating.3  One health center pays its employees “biweekly, on \n \n3 Plaintiffs submitted most of these declarations alongside their reply in support of the TRO motion, \nECF No. 24, and submitted an additional declaration the evening of February 2, 2025, ECF No. 27.  \nWhile such declarations should normally be filed concurrently with the complaint, any delay in \ncompiling these materials is entirely of Defendants’ own making.  OMB issued memorandum \nM-25-13 less than twenty-four hours before it was set to take effect.  Plaintiffs can hardly be \nblamed for needing more than a single morning and afternoon to submit critical evidence under \nexigent circumstances.  Defendants object to one of the declarations, “Exhibit F,” ECF No. 24-6, \nbecause it came from a party that only joined one of the Plaintiff coalitions after the lawsuit was \nfiled.  Because standing “is assessed as of the time a suit commences,” Chamber of Commerce, \n642 F.3d at 200, the court will not consider Exhibit F as part of its standing analysis.  The court \nmay, however, consider Exhibit F for purposes of assessing mootness because mootness asks \nwhether post-complaint events impact the court’s jurisdiction.  See Garcia v. U.S. Citizenship & \nImmgr. Servs., 168 F. Supp. 3d 50, 65 (D.D.C. 2016) (explaining that standing “is concerned with \nthe presence of injury, causation, and redressability at the time a complaint is filed,” whereas \nmootness “scrutinizes the presence of these elements after filing—i.e., at the time of a court’s \ndecision”).  \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 9 of 30\nThursdays,” requiring it to “draw down grant funds on the preceding Tuesday” so that they reach \nthe health center’s bank account by Wednesday.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 6.  Some of those employees \n“live paycheck to paycheck,” meaning that a single missed payment could prevent them from \nbuying groceries or paying rent.  Id. ¶ 7.  Separately, a member of a tribal organization was forced \nto lay off two employees on January 28 because it could not access its grant funds that day.  ECF \nNo. 24-5 ¶ 13.  And another nonprofit dedicated to ending homelessness was forced to suspend a \nbirth certificate and identification card program just so that it could keep its employees on payroll.  \nECF No. 24-7 ¶ 20-21.  \nDefendants also speculate that, at least for some organizations, OMB may have pre-\napproved certain programs so as to prevent any interruption in disbursements.  Unfortunately for \nDefendants, the precise opposite appears to be true.  According to Plaintiffs’ declarations, many \norganizations were blocked from accessing their funds well before 5:00 p.m. on January 28, when \nthe freeze was set to begin.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶ 8 (unable to access fund portal during the \nday on January 28); 24-7 ¶ 13 (same); 24-8 ¶ 9 (unable to access fund portal on January 27).   \nThe alleged injuries to Plaintiffs’ many members are sufficiently concrete and imminent to \nsatisfy the first element of standing.  For many, the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative, \nimpending, and potentially catastrophic.  Defendants’ assertion that these injuries are nothing more \nthan “a setback to [Plaintiffs’] abstract social interests,” ECF No. 26, at 3-4 (quoting Food & Drug \nAdmin. v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 394 (2024)), is blatantly contradicted by \nthe record.  Plaintiffs have adequately shown injury in fact.   \nb.  Causation \nDefendants next try to break the causal chain between memorandum M-25-13 and Plaintiffs’ \nharms.  Defendants argue that with the memorandum now rescinded, any lingering pauses in \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 10 of 30\nfunding are not fairly traceable to the memorandum itself.  Instead, they say, Plaintiffs must take \nup their grievances with the individual agencies responsible for disbursing their funds.  ECF \nNos. 21-1, at 10-11; 26, at 5-7.   \nAt a high level, Defendants are correct that harms caused by third parties are generally not \ntraceable to the defendant.  See Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 664 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(en banc) (explaining that traceability must be to “the challenged acts of the defendant, not of some \nabsent third party”).  And where causation “hinge[s] on the independent choices of [a] regulated \nthird party,” like the states or other federal actors, it is the plaintiff’s burden “to adduce facts \nshowing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation.” \nCtr. for L. & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs claim that \nmemorandum M-25-13 “was not a suggestion but a command to agencies, and [the agencies] have \ntreated it as such.”  ECF No. 24, at 17.  They further allege that their economic and constitutional \nharms stem directly from the memorandum’s directives, making OMB and Acting Director Vaeth \nthe proper defendants.  Id. \nIn their briefing, Defendants rely on two cases to make their counterargument.  See ECF \nNo. 21-1, at 10-11.  In Louisiana ex rel. Landry v. Biden, 64 F.4th 674 (5th Cir. 2023), the Fifth \nCircuit held that an OMB working group’s “guidance” and publication of cost estimates did not \nconfer standing on plaintiffs who sought to block its effects, id. at 681-82.  As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit’s ruling had nothing to do with the causation element of standing.  The court only \nconsidered whether the “possibility of regulation” was an “injury in fact.”  Id. (quoting Nat’l Ass’n \nof Home Builders v. EPA, 667 F.3d 6, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  But even if the court were to extend \nits reasoning to causation, Defendants’ argument still fails.  The executive order in Louisiana \n“d[id] not require any action from federal agencies.”  Id. at 681.  Agencies were not mandated to \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 11 of 30\n“implement the Interim Estimates” and could “exercise discretion” in choosing whether or not they \napplied.  Id.  In contrast, memorandum M-25-13 states in no uncertain terms (and in bold typeface, \nno less) that “Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or \ndisbursement of all Federal financial assistance.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2.  Such a \ndirective leaves no room for discretion.  Louisiana is therefore inapposite.   \nDefendants’ second case fares no better.  In Jacobson v. Florida Secretary of State, 974 \nF.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 2020), voters sued to change the process by which gubernatorial candidates \nwere listed on voting ballots, id. at 1242.  The plaintiffs only named the Florida secretary of state \nas a defendant.  Id.  The Eleventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs could not show causation because \nnonparty “supervisors of elections”—not the secretary of state—determined the ballot order.  Id. \nat 1253.  But critical to the court’s ruling was the fact that the supervisors were “independent \nofficials under Florida law who [were] not subject to the [s]ecretary’s control.”  Id.  Instead, they \nwere “constitutional officers who [were] elected at the county level by the people of Florida.”  Id.  \nSuing the secretary was therefore futile because she exercised no executive, statutory, or other \nauthority over the supervisors’ actions.  Here, however, Defendants do not argue that OMB is \npowerless to dictate executive policy, nor could they (indeed, they try to argue the exact opposite).  \nSee 31 U.S.C. § 503 (establishing that OMB “[p]rovides overall direction and leadership to the \nexecutive branch on financial management matters by establishing financial management policies \nand requirements”); ECF No. 21-1, at 16-20.  Unlike the secretary in Jacobson, OMB can exert \nsome influence on federal spending policy (even though Plaintiffs dispute the extend of that \nauthority).  Its actions therefore give rise to causation in this case.   \nThe record also supports Plaintiffs’ allegations of causation.  On January 30, after this court’s \nadministrative stay and OMB’s purported “rescission” of M-25-13, the Environmental Protection \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 12 of 30\nAgency responded to a nonprofit’s funding inquiry by saying that it was still “working diligently \nto implement [OMB]’s memorandum, Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other \nFinancial Assistance Programs.”  ECF No. 24-1, at 7.  The EPA further explained that it was \n“temporarily pausing all activities related to the obligation or disbursement of EPA Federal \nfinancial assistance at this time” and was “continuing to work with OMB” to do so.  Id.  The EPA’s \nstatement that it was freezing funds in order to “implement” memorandum M-25-13 contradicts \nDefendants’ claim that continued pauses are only attributable to independent agency action.  At \noral argument, Defendants represented that as soon as they learned of EPA’s continued pause, they \ncontacted  the  agency  to  correct  any  misunderstandings.    Oral  Argument,  Nat’l  Council  of \nNonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  In this early posture, however, and pending \nfurther factual development by the parties, the court relies on Plaintiffs’ post-rescission declarations \nto conclude that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged causation. \nc.  Redressability \nCausation and redressability are closely related.  While the former “focus[es] on whether \na particular party is appropriate[,] redressability [considers] whether the forum is.”  Bentsen, 94 \nF.3d at 664.  In short, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the relief sought, if granted, “will likely \nalleviate the particularized injury alleged.”  Id. at 663-64.  Plaintiffs argue that blocking Defendants \nfrom doing anything to implement the substance of memorandum M-25-13 would remedy their \nharms.  ECF No. 24, at 17-18. \nDefendants respond by saying that blocking memorandum M-25-13 “would not prevent \nnon-defendant  agencies  from  exercising  their  own  independent  authorities  to  determine \nwhether . . . a pause is warranted.”  ECF No. 21-1, at 11.  But, as discussed above, there is at least \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 13 of 30\nsome evidence that agencies are pausing disbursements because of memorandum M-25-13.  See \nsupra Part II.A.1.b.   \nPrior to the issuance of memorandum M-25-13, Plaintiffs’ members reportedly never had \nproblems drawing down funds or receiving financial assistance.  ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶ 8; 24-5 ¶ 10.  That \nall changed beginning January 28, immediately after OMB issued memorandum M-25-13.  Streams \nof funds that had steadily flowed for years without issue suddenly ran dry.  If the court were to \ngrant Plaintiffs’ requested relief, Defendants would be barred from instructing all federal agencies \nacross the board to temporarily pause (or continue pausing) financial assistance on the basis of the \nmemorandum or its substance.4  In other words, agencies  would need  to  behave as if the \nmemorandum were never issued.  Defendants act as if any continued freeze is merely a random \ncoincidence that could not possibly have anything to do with their memorandum.  In the court’s \nview, that explanation ignores both logic and fact.  Plaintiffs have adequately shown that a ruling \nin their favor will alleviate their alleged injuries.   \n2.  Mootness \nMootness concerns whether there is still a live controversy for the court to adjudicate.  Courts \noften describe mootness as “the doctrine of standing set in a time frame.”  U.S. Parole Comm’n v. \nGeraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980) (quoting Henry P. Monaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: \nThe Who and When, 82 Yale L.J. 1363, 1384 (1973)).  Defendants characterize Plaintiffs’ complaint \nas only challenging OMB memorandum M-25-13.  ECF No. 21-1, at 6.  Therefore, in Defendants’ \n \n4 Based on Plaintiffs’ representations at oral argument, this relief would only apply to open awards \nthat have been affected by OMB’s directive.  Oral Argument, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, \nNo. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 14 of 30\nview, OMB’s post-complaint rescission of that memorandum eliminated the lawsuit’s only basis \nand mooted Plaintiffs’ claims.  Id.  This fails for several reasons. \nFirst, it is blackletter law that a defendant’s “voluntary cessation of a challenged practice \ndoes not deprive a federal court of its power to determine [its] legality.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. \nv. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting City of Mesquite v. \nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  If voluntary cessation automatically mooted \nevery case, a defendant would be “free to return to [its] old ways” as soon as the case was dismissed.  \nId. (quoting City of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289).  Voluntary cessation can only deprive the court of \njurisdiction if it is “absolutely clear [that] the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be \nexpected to recur.”  Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm’n, 92 F.4th 1124, 1128 (D.C. \nCir. 2024) (emphasis added) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 189).  This is a “heavy \nburden” for the party asserting mootness.  Id.   \nHere, Defendants claim that they have ended any allegedly unlawful activity by retracting \nmemorandum M-25-13.  Even taking the rescission at face value, however, Defendants have not \nconvincingly shown that they will refrain from “resum[ing] the challenged activity” in the future.  \nPub. Citizen, Inc., 92 F.4th at 1128.  As evidenced by the White House Press Secretary’s statements, \nOMB and the various agencies it communicates with appear committed to restricting federal \nfunding.  If Defendants retracted the memorandum in name only while continuing to execute its \ndirectives, it is far from “absolutely clear” that the conduct is gone for good.  There is nothing \nstopping OMB from rewording, repackaging, or reissuing the substance of memorandum M-25-13 \nif the court were to dismiss this lawsuit.   \nThe voluntary cessation doctrine is especially important in cases where the defendant is \nsuspected of “manipulating the judicial process through the false pretense of singlehandedly \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 15 of 30\nending a dispute.”  Pub. Citizen, Inc., 92 F.4th at 1128 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nGuedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 F.3d 1, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(per curiam)).  Plaintiffs accuse Defendants of doing exactly that here.  ECF No. 24, at 19-20.   \nDefendants understandably dispute this accusation.  They protest that such a conclusion \n“would be contrary to the presumption of good faith that courts routinely accord the government \nwhen assessing voluntary cessation.”  ECF No. 26, at 8 (citing Am. Cargo Transp., Inc. v. United \nStates, 625 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir. 2010)).  Defendants are correct that courts of this circuit \ngenerally hesitate “to impute such manipulative conduct to a coordinate branch of government.”  \nPub. Citizen, Inc., 92 F.4th at 1128-29 (quoting Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 705 (D.C. \nCir. 1990) (en banc)).   But this reluctance does not apply when the government defendant \ndeliberately acts “in order to avoid litigation.”  Alaska v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 17 F.4th 1224, 1229 \n(D.C. Cir. 2021) (quoting Am. Bar Ass’n v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 636 F.3d 641, 648 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  \nHere, Defendants’ plea for a presumption of good faith rings hollow when their own actions \ncontradict their representations.   \nWithin hours of OMB’s rescission, White House Press Secretary Leavitt announced that \nthe rescission was to have no tangible effect on “the federal funding freeze.”  Leavitt, X (formerly \nTwitter) (Jan. 29, 2025), https://perma.cc/99C4-5V6G.  Moreover, she explained that the primary \npurpose of the rescission was “[t]o end any confusion created by the court’s injunction.”  Id.  That \nstatement unambiguously reflects that the rescission was in direct response to this court’s issuance \nof an administrative stay on January 28.5  For Defendants to innocently claim that OMB’s post-\nstay actions were merely a noble attempt to “end[] confusion,” ECF No. 26, at 8, strains credulity.  \n \n5 The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island had yet to enter a TRO at the time of the \nPress Secretary’s social media post, so the post could not have been referring to that case.  See \nTRO, New York, No. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025), ECF No. 50. \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 16 of 30\nBy rescinding the memorandum that announced the freeze, but “NOT . . . the federal funding \nfreeze” itself, id., it appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without \nactually ceasing the challenged conduct.  The court can think of few things more disingenuous.  \nPreventing a defendant from evading judicial review under such false pretenses is precisely why \nthe voluntary cessation doctrine exists.  The rescission, if it can be called that, appears to be nothing \nmore than a thinly veiled attempt to prevent this court from granting relief.   \nSecond, even if voluntary cessation did not apply, the facts on the ground indicate that this \ncase is anything but moot.  Even aside from the Press Secretary’s seeming admission that the pause \nwill continue as planned, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that fund recipients continue to be \ndeprived of critical loans, grants, and other resources.  For example, the chief executive officer of \na community health center stated that he was unable to access critical funds awarded under an H80 \ngrant (authorized by the Public Health Service Act) starting on January 28.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 10.  \nAfter this court entered its administrative stay that afternoon, he was still unable to access funds \nthe next day.  Id. ¶ 11.  And after OMB rescinded memorandum M-25-13 on January 29, he was \nstill blocked from accessing grant funds as recently as January 31.  Id. ¶ 12.  Similarly, members \nof a tribal organization who were unable to draw down grant funds starting on January 28 had still \nnot received any funds as recently as January 31.  ECF No. 24-5 ¶ 24.  And low-income parents \nwho rely on federal grants to enable their children to attend childcare still had not received their \nsubsidies as recently as January 31.  ECF No. 24-11 ¶ 19; see, e.g., ECF Nos. 24-6, 24-7, 24-8, \n24-9.  Each of these examples indicates that the funding pause remains in effect—at least for some \nrecipients—despite OMB’s rescission of memorandum M-25-13.  Defendants cannot persuasively \nargue that the rescission of memorandum M-25-13 moots the case if the effects and directives of \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 17 of 30\nthat memorandum continue to remain in full force.  Destroying the paper trail of allegedly illegal \nactivity means nothing if the activity persists.   \nIn a last-ditch effort to toss the case on mootness grounds, Defendants argue that even if \naspects of the funding freeze remain in effect, they persist independent of memorandum M-25-13 \nand thus must be challenged in a different lawsuit.  ECF No. 26, at 9.  In their view, just because \nsome money is not “going out the door” does not necessarily mean that it is due to OMB’s action.  \nOral Argument, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  To the extent \nthat funds still remain paused in spite of this court’s administrative stay or the memorandum’s \nrescission, Defendants argue that those pauses are the result of independent agency discretion or \nthe President’s executive orders. \nThis is essentially a slightly repackaged version of Defendants’ causation argument: with \nthe memorandum now rescinded, any lingering pauses in funding are not fairly traceable to the \nmemorandum itself.  Insofar as this lawsuit challenges the memorandum, Defendants argue that \nthat avenue to relief is now closed.  But, as explained above, supra Part II.A.1.b. & n.4, the court \nis not persuaded that the continuing freezes are solely due to independent agency action.  Both \nlogic and record evidence point to the opposite conclusion.  As Plaintiffs’ counsel noted at oral \nargument, it is unclear whether twenty-four hours is sufficient time for an agency to independently \nreview a single grant, let alone hundreds of thousands of them.  Oral Argument, Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).   \nWith respect to the executive orders, which the parties discussed at length during oral \nargument, the court remains unconvinced.  Defendants’ counsel cited provisions of the executive \norders referenced in M-25-13 that purportedly required temporary pauses in funding.  Id.  It is true \nthat at least some of the executive orders contain language that could be construed as requiring fund \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 18 of 30\npauses (albeit on much more drawn out timelines than memorandum M-25-13).  See Exec. Order \nNo. 14,151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. \nReg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (requiring all federal agencies to “terminate, to the maximum extent \nallowed  by  law, . . . ‘equity-related’  grants  or  contracts”  within  sixty  days);  Exec.  Order \nNo. 14,162, Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements, 90 Fed. Reg. 8455 \n(Jan. 20, 2025) (directing the United States Ambassador to the United Nations to “immediately \ncease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change”).  But Plaintiffs have provided evidence that \nthe scope of frozen funds appears to extend far beyond the reach of the executive orders, thus \nundermining Defendants’ claims.   \nAs just one example, a health center that provides medical, dental, and behavioral health \nservices to a rural community was denied access to grant funds.  See ECF No. 24-4.  None of the \nseven executive orders listed in memorandum M-25-13 would seem to cover such activity.  See, \ne.g., Exec. Order No. 14,159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion, 90 Fed. Reg. 8443 \n(Jan. 20, 2025) (addressing illegal immigration); Exec. Order No. 14,169, Reevaluating and \nRealigning United States Foreign Aid, 90 Fed. Reg. 8619 (Jan. 20, 2025) (addressing foreign aid); \nExec. Order No. 14,162, Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements, 90 \nFed. Reg. 8455 (Jan. 20, 2025) (addressing international environmental agreements); Exec. Order \nNo. 14,154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 20, 2025) (addressing energy \nindustry and regulations); Exec. Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (addressing diversity, equity, and \ninclusion  programs);  Exec.  Order  No. 14,168,  Defending  Women  from  Gender  Ideology \nExtremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 20, \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 19 of 30\n2025) (addressing “gender ideology”); Exec. Order No. 14,182, Enforcing the Hyde Amendment, \n90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 24, 2025) (addressing federal funding of abortion).  At oral argument, \nwhen asked about  another declarant  who was  receiving a grant  from  the National  Science \nFoundation, see ECF No. 24-7, Defendants could not give a clear answer as to why that recipient \nwould be denied  funds pursuant  to the  executive orders, Oral  Argument,  Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  In sum, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that \nrescinding memorandum M-25-13 did not moot the case.  \n*  *  * \nFor these reasons, the court concludes that it has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ complaint. \nB.  Temporary Restraining Order \nA temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy meant to prevent serious and \nimminent harm in dire circumstances.  To obtain one, “the moving party must show (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were \nnot granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that \nthe public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. \nEngland, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nThese four considerations are factors, not elements.  “A district court must ‘balance the \nstrengths of the requesting party’s arguments in each of the four required areas.’”  Id. (quoting \nCityFed Fin. Corp. v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  When a \ngovernment entity is a party to the case, the third and fourth factors merge.  Pursuing Am.’s \nGreatness v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nPrior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008), courts in this circuit tended to employ a “sliding scale” method in which \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 20 of 30\n“a strong showing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.”  Sherley v. \nSebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  While the D.C. Circuit has considered abandoning \nthe sliding-scale method for one that treats the substantial likelihood prong as “an independent, \nfree-standing requirement,” id. at 393, it has yet to decide one way or the other, see Changji Esquel \nTextile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  At the very least, however, the \nplaintiff must present a “serious legal question on the merits.”  Raimondo, 40 F.4th at 726 (quoting \nSherley, 644 F.3d at 398).  Given the ambiguity with respect to the sliding-scale approach, the \ncourt will consider all factors and only delve into their relevant weight if it would affect the \noutcome.  See Costa v. Bazron, 456 F. Supp. 3d 126, 133 (D.D.C. 2020).   \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe parties break this factor into several subcomponents, but the court only needs to \naddress two at this stage.  First, they dispute whether memorandum M-25-13 is final agency action \nsubject to judicial review.  If it is not, then Plaintiffs’ APA claims cannot proceed.  Second, they \ndebate the merits of Plaintiffs’ three separate claims.  While the parties discussed all three claims \nin their briefs and at oral argument, the court only needs to find that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \non one in order for this factor to weigh in favor of a TRO.6  See Media Matters for Am. v. Paxton, \n \n6 Although two of Plaintiffs’ claims are not critical to the court’s ruling at this juncture, the parties \nwill have the opportunity to further develop all three claims as this case proceeds.  Even so, the \ncourt notes that Plaintiffs have shown some likelihood of success—or, at the very least, “a ‘serious \nlegal question’ on the merits,” Sherley, 644 F.3d at 398—on their remaining claims.  There is \nsubstantial room for debate as to whether OMB’s authorizing statute, 31 U.S.C. § 503, permits it \nto order the kind of sweeping, nationwide directive that it commanded here.  And while Defendants \nare correct that the government “is not required to subsidize First Amendment rights,” Leathers v. \nMedlock, 499 U.S. 439, 450 (1991), it is less clear whether it may deliberately withhold funds that \nhave already been earmarked for certain recipients based exclusively on the recipient’s viewpoints.   \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 21 of 30\n732 F. Supp. 3d 1, 27 (D.D.C.), appeal filed, No. 24-7059 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  The court will \ntherefore focus on Plaintiffs’ assertion that OMB’s actions were arbitrary and capricious.   \na.  Final agency action \nThe APA only permits judicial review of “final agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, which is \naction that “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and determines \n“rights or obligations . . . from which legal consequences will flow,” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154, 177-78 (1997) (first quoting Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. \n103, 113 (1948), then quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass’n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)).  The APA does not allow a court to review an agency’s \n“day-to-day operations.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 899.   \nDefendants argue that the memorandum simply told agencies to conduct their own review \nof financial disbursements and thus “did not determine legal consequences.”7  ECF No. 26, at 12.  \nThis characterization, however, is in tension with the language of the memorandum and the facts \non the ground.  Defendants’ assertion that the memorandum “did not itself determine which funds \nor grants should be paused” is true, but not in a way that helps them.  Memorandum M-25-13 did \nnot specify certain funds to be frozen; it froze all of them.  Rather than give the agencies full \ncontrol over what to freeze and what to leave undisturbed, Defendants mandated that all “Federal \nagencies must temporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or disbursement of all \nFederal financial assistance.”  OMB Pause Memorandum, at 2 (second emphasis added).  That is \n \n7 In their briefs, Defendants only seem to challenge whether the memorandum determined “rights \nor obligations . . . from which legal consequences will flow,” and not whether it marked the \n“consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking.”  See ECF No. 24, at 22. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 22 of 30\nnot merely a guidance.  It is a directive that immediately produced legal consequences across the \nentire federal funding system.   \nDefendants’ cited cases do not help them.  In Fund for Animals, Inc. v. U.S. Bureau of Land \nManagement, 460 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 2006), for example, an agency’s strategy to justify a larger \nbudget was not final agency action because it “d[id] not command anyone to do anything or to \nrefrain from doing anything,” id. at 22 (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. \n726, 733 (1998)).  Memorandum M-25-13, however, commanded agencies to pause all funding \nobligations within twenty-four hours.  In Village of Bensenville v. Federal Aviation Administration, \n457 F.3d 52 (D.C. Cir. 2006), an agency’s letter of intent proposing a reimbursement schedule was \nnot  final  agency  action  because  the  reimbursement  recipient  still  needed  to  file  additional \ndocuments before the money could be disbursed, id. at 69.  Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that open \nawards—ones that have already been approved and partially disbursed—were shut down in response \nto M-25-13.  And in Center for Auto Safety v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \n452 F.3d 798 (D.C. Cir. 2006), an agency’s policy guideline was not final agency action because \nit “[did] not command[], require[], order[], or dictate[]” anything, id. at 809.  It simply made \ngeneral recommendations that manufacturers could choose to follow.  Id.  The agency’s own \nofficials were not even bound to the letter of the recommendation; they “remained free to exercise \ndiscretion” in any tasks implicated by the guideline.  Id.  M-25-13, in contrast, did not merely \nsuggest that agencies temporarily suspend grants; it announced that agencies “must” do so.   \nA true “guidance” might have advised federal agencies to conduct independent reviews \nand pause funds as necessary.  But M-25-13 did not condition any such pause in this way.  It said \nthat all federal agencies “must temporarily pause all activities related to [the] obligation or \ndisbursement of all Federal financial assistance” while such review was still ongoing.  OMB Pause \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 23 of 30\nMemorandum, at 2 (second emphasis added).  By any measure, Defendants’ action led to legal \nconsequences and constituted final agency action.   \nb.  Whether OMB’s actions were arbitrary and capricious \nUnder the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  “The scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ \nstandard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  To \npass muster, the agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action, including ‘a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Id. \n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Agency action is \ngenerally deemed unlawful if it “has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to \nconsider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for \nits decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could \nnot be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs allege that OMB’s funding freeze lacked any reasonable basis and failed to \nconsider the disastrous effects it would have.  ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 43-48.  Defendants, meanwhile, insist \nthat “there is nothing irrational about a temporary pause in funding” when it is done “to ensure \ncompliance with the President’s priorities.”  ECF No. 21-1, at 22.  But furthering the President’s \nwishes cannot be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases.  The APA requires a rational \nconnection between the facts, the agency’s rationale, and the ultimate decision.  Defendants have \noffered no rational explanation for why they needed to freeze all federal financial assistance—\nwith less than twenty-four-hours’ notice—to “safeguard valuable taxpayer resources.”  OMB \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 24 of 30\nPause Memorandum, at 1.  If Defendants intend to conduct an exhaustive review of what programs \nshould or should not be funded, such a review could be conducted without depriving millions of \nAmericans  access  to  vital  resources.    As  Defendants  themselves  admit,  the  memorandum \nimplicated as much as $3 trillion in financial assistance.  That is a breathtakingly large sum of \nmoney to suspend practically overnight.  Rather than taking a measured approach to identify \npurportedly wasteful spending, Defendants cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide \nmachine—seemingly without any consideration for the consequences of that decision.  To say that \nOMB “failed to consider an important aspect of the problem” would be putting it mildly.  \nDefendants also ignored significant reliance interests in deciding to freeze federal funds on \nsuch a massive scale.  While “unidentified and unproven reliance interests are not a valid basis on \nwhich to undo agency action,” Solenex LLC v. Bernhardt, 962 F.3d 520, 529 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(emphasis  added),  Plaintiffs  have  marshalled  considerable  evidence  showing  that  countless \norganizations depend on continued disbursements to continue functioning at all.  For at least some \nof Plaintiffs’ members, having federal funds arrive on time and as scheduled is vital.8  See ECF \nNos. 24-4 ¶¶ 4, 6 (explaining that federal grants cover roughly 30% of the organization’s payroll \nand that disbursements are ordinarily so consistent that funds are paid to employees within a week \nof  receipt);  24-5  ¶ 13  (explaining  that  a  tribal  organization  relied  so  heavily  on  consistent \ndisbursements that it was forced to lay off two employees as soon as the pause began on \n \n8 The court is unpersuaded by Defendants’ assertion that reliance interests only apply to the receipt \nof funds but not the timing of when they are received.  ECF No. 21-1, at 23.  Such a claim is \nwithout legal support and defies logic.  If an organization is unable to meet payroll, that could \nimmediately prevent its employees from paying rent or affording groceries.  Similarly, if a clinic \nis forced to shut its doors and turn away patients, that produces instant harm that cannot be \nremedied by a later resumption of funds.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 25 of 30\nJanuary 28).  Unlike the district court in Solenex, the court here makes no assumptions about \nreliance interests.  Those interests, as illustrated through Plaintiffs’ declarations, are all too real.  \nIn addition, Defendants’ actions appear to suffer from infirmities of a constitutional \nmagnitude.  The appropriation of the government’s resources is reserved for Congress, not the \nExecutive Branch.  And a wealth of legal authority supports this fundamental separation of powers.  \nThe legislature’s “power of the purse is the ultimate check on the . . . power of the Executive.”  \nU.S.  House  of  Representatives  v.  Burwell,  130  F.  Supp.  3d  53,  76  (D.D.C. 2015).    The \nAppropriations  Clause  of  the  Constitution  gives  Congress  “exclusive  power”  over  federal \nspending.  U.S. Dep’t of the Navy v. Fed. Lab. Rels. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. EPA, 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).  Without it, \n“the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation[] and might \napply all its monied resources at his pleasure.”  Id. at 1347 (quoting 3 Joseph Story, Commentaries \non the Constitution of the United States § 1342, at 213-14 (1833)).  Indeed, the Clause “was \nintended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority of the Executive [Branch].”  Cincinnati \nSoap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937).   \nCongress has exercised its plenary power to give meaning to the Appropriations Clause \nand “reinforce [its] control over appropriated funds.”  Id.  In 1982, Congress enacted the “Purpose \nStatute,” which requires the appropriation of federal funds in accordance with “the objects for \nwhich . . . [they] were made.”  31 U.S.C. § 1301(a).  Any “reappropriation and diversion of the \nunexpended balance of an appropriation for a purpose other than that for which [it] originally was \nmade” is treated “as a new appropriation.”  Id. § 1301(b).  Related laws expressly prohibit the \nExecutive Branch from encroaching on Congress’s appropriations power.  See id. §§ 1341, 1350.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 26 of 30\nMost notably, the Impoundment Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq., lays out specific procedures \nwhenever the President wishes to suspend appropriations that have already been enacted.   \nDefendants’  actions  in  this  case  potentially  run  roughshod  over  a  “bulwark  of  the \nConstitution” by interfering with Congress’s appropriation of federal funds.  U.S. Dep’t of the \nNavy, 665 F.3d at 1347.  OMB ordered a nationwide freeze on pre-existing financial commitments \nwithout considering any of the specifics of the individual loans, grants, or funds.  It did not indicate \nwhen that freeze would end (if it was to end at all).  And it attempted to wrest the power of the \npurse away from the only branch of government entitled to wield it.  If Defendants’ actions violated \nthe separation of powers, that would certainly be arbitrary and capricious under the APA.   \nAt this stage, Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their \narbitrary and capricious claim.   \n2.  Irreparable Injury \nIrreparable injury is “a high standard.”  England, 454 F.3d at 297.  First, the injury “must \nbe both certain and great,” “actual and not theoretical,” and “of such imminence that there is a \n‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief.”  Id. (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, \n674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  Second, the injury “must be beyond remediation,” meaning \nthat “[t]he possibility [of] adequate compensatory or other corrective relief . . . at a later date . . . \nweighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.”  Id. at 297-98 (quoting Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d \nat 674).  Plaintiffs easily meet their burden here. \n“[O]bstacles [that] unquestionably make it more difficult for the [plaintiff] to accomplish \n[its] primary mission . . . provide injury for purposes . . . [of] irreparable harm.”  League of Women \nVoters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  While ordinary economic injuries are \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 27 of 30\nusually insufficient, financial harm can “constitute irreparable harm . . . where the loss threatens \nthe very existence of the movant’s business.”  Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.   \nIf the freeze were to remain in effect, Plaintiffs’ members will suffer “existential injuries” \nand some programs may “simply disappear.”  ECF No. 5-1, at 12.  Their workers may be unable \nto pay for housing or food.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 7 (“A lot of our staff live paycheck to paycheck, and \nif they can’t get paid, then they are unable to pay rent or buy groceries.”).  Some have already been \nforced to “shutter [their] programs” just to make payroll.  ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 20-21.  And patients \nor customers that rely on their services may be denied care when it is most needed.  ECF Nos. 24-4 \n¶ 16; 24-5 ¶ 21.  For some, these are harms for which “there can be no do over and no redress.”  \nNewby, 838 F.3d at 9 (quoting League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, \n247 (4th Cir. 2014)); see ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 7 (“[I]f my Health Center loses physicians, dentist, or \nnurse practitioners, then it will be virtually impossible to recruit replacements to a rural Health \nSystem that is suddenly an unreliable source of income.”).   \nSome of these organizations are still waiting for funds to be disbursed.  ECF Nos. 24-4 \n¶ 11; 24-6 ¶ 18; 24-8 ¶ 10-11.  In the meantime, they’ve been forced to dismiss employees, cut \nessential programs, and pay workers out of their own pockets.  ECF Nos. 24-4 ¶ 12; 24-5 ¶ 13; \n24-7 ¶ 21; 24-8 ¶ 12.  Each day that the pause continues to ripple across the country is an additional \nday that Americans are being denied access to programs that heal them, house them, and feed \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 28 of 30\nthem.    Because  the  funding  freeze  threatens  the  lifeline  that  keeps  countless  organizations \noperational, Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing irreparable harm.9   \n3.  Prejudice and Public Interest \nThe declarations and evidence presented by Plaintiffs paint a stark picture of nationwide \npanic in the wake of the funding freeze.  Organizations with every conceivable mission—\nhealthcare, scientific research, emergency shelters, and more—were shut out of funding portals or \ndenied critical resources beginning on January 28.  See ECF Nos. 24-4, 24-5, 24-6, 24-7, 24-8, \n24-9, 24-10, 24-11.  For many, the chaos began well before 5:00 p.m. as various agencies—\nthemselves scrambling to figure out how to comply with memorandum M-25-13—began taking \ntheir funding apparatuses offline.  ECF Nos. 24-8 ¶¶ 8-9; 24-6 ¶ 15; 24-7 ¶ 13; 24-8 ¶ 9.  The \ndirectors  of  the  recipient  organizations  were  forced  to  take  drastic  measures.    Some  tried \ndesperately for hours to log into their grant accounts, while others prepared for the worst by laying \noff employees.  Many of the organizations rely on federal funding to pay their workers, meaning \nthat the freeze forced them to send staff home or close their doors.   \nThe potential scope of the freeze is as great as $3 trillion and its effects are difficult to fully \ngrasp.  Plaintiffs point to news reports detailing far-reaching effects: preschools could not pay their \n \n9 At oral argument, Defendants asserted that the TRO issued by the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Rhode Island undermined Plaintiffs’ claims of irreparable harm.  The government \ndefendants in that case understood the TRO to apply to “all awards or obligations—not just those \ninvolving the Plaintiff States.”  Notice of Compliance with Court’s TRO, Ex. A, New York, \nNo. 25-CV-39 (D.R.I. Feb. 3, 2025), ECF No. 51-1, at 1.  Even assuming that the Rhode Island \nTRO applies to Plaintiffs, that would not block this court from entering a TRO of its own.  See \nWhitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 60 (D.D.C. \n2020) (“[C]ourts routinely grant follow-on injunctions against the Government, even in instances \nwhen an earlier nationwide injunction has already provided plaintiffs in the later action with their \ndesired relief.”) (collecting cases).  This court has no control over the duration or scope of the \nDistrict of Rhode Island’s TRO.  Failing to grant a TRO here when Plaintiffs have met the \nrequirements for one would leave them unprotected and vulnerable to further harm. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 29 of 30\nstaff; Los Angeles and North Carolina were denied disaster relief aid; and elderly Americans who \nrelied on subsidized programs for food did not know if their next meal would come.  ECF No. 24, \nat 41.  The court concludes that the balance of the equities and public interest heavily favor granting \nPlaintiffs’ request.10 \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order, ECF No. 5, is GRANTED.  It is further \nORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 21, is DENIED.  It is further \nORDERED  that  Defendants  are  enjoined  from  implementing,  giving  effect  to,  or \nreinstating under a different name the directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to \nthe disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards; it is further \nORDERED  that  Defendants  must  provide  written  notice  of  the  court’s  temporary \nrestraining order to all agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-25-13 was addressed.  The \nwritten notice shall instruct those agencies that they may not take any steps to implement, give \neffect to, or reinstate under a different name the directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with \nrespect to the disbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards.  It shall also instruct those \nagencies to release any disbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum \nM-25-13; it is further \n \n10 Defendants also request that the court convert this proceeding into one for a preliminary \ninjunction (rather than a TRO).  Oral Argument, Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, No. 25-CV-239 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  Given that this case was filed less than a week ago, concerns weighty legal \nissues that require careful consideration, and involves a constantly shifting factual landscape, the \ncourt declines Defendants’ request.  The parties will be given an opportunity to fully brief and \nargue Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction on a schedule of their choosing. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 30     Filed 02/03/25     Page 30 of 30\nORDERED that this Order shall apply to the maximum extent provided for by Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(2) and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705 and 706.  It is further \nORDERED that Defendants shall file a status report on or before February 7, 2025, \napprising the court of the status of its compliance with this Order, including by providing a copy \nof the written notice described above; and it is further \nORDERED that the parties shall meet and confer and file a joint status report proposing a \npreliminary injunction briefing schedule on or before February 7, 2025.  \n SO ORDERED. \n \n \nLOREN L.

No. 61, the parties have met and conferred \nregarding  a  proposed  briefing  schedule.  Prior  to  the  Court’s  Order,  Defendants \napproached Plaintiffs to solicit their position on a forthcoming motion to stay further \nproceedings in this case pending the resolution of Defendants’ ongoing appeal of the \nCourt’s preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit, see Dkt. Nos. 51, 52, 62; however, after the Court ordered this \nstatus report, and because any stay would necessarily affect any proposed briefing \nschedule, the parties agreed it would be most efficient to address their positions on a \nstay  in  this  status  report  rather  than  through  additional  motions  practice. \nDefendants reserve the right to make such a motion should the Court determine that \nthis status report is not the appropriate vehicle for disposing of the stay issue.  \nThe parties disagree as to whether the Court should stay proceedings pending \nresolution of the appeal of the preliminary injunction, as discussed further below. In \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 2 of 14\nthe event the Court is inclined to deny the requested stay, then the parties agree it \nwould be appropriate for the Court to enter a schedule for Defendants to produce the \nadministrative record and for the parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment. \nThe parties disagree, however, on the timing for production of the administrative \nrecord and summary judgment briefing, as set forth below.  \nDEFENDANTS’ POSITION \n \nStay of Proceedings Pending Appeal \n \n  Defendants respectfully request that the Court stay further proceedings in this \ncase pending the resolution of Defendants’ ongoing appeal of the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction to the D.C. Circuit. The interests of judicial economy support a stay of \nthese proceedings to allow the parties and this Court to have the benefit of whatever \nruling is issued by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit is likely to rule on Plaintiffs’ \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims and provide guidance on the \ngoverning legal framework in relatively short order. While that appeal is ongoing, \nPlaintiffs continue to have the benefit of this Court’s injunction such that there is no \nlonger any urgency requiring expeditious litigation of their claims. This Court’s \ninjunction already provides all the relief the Plaintiffs are seeking, so there is no \nlonger any plausible basis for claiming imminent or ongoing irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs and their members.   \n  “The District Court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to \nits power to control its own docket.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997); see \nalso Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936) (“[T]he power to stay proceedings \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 3 of 14\nis incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the \ncauses on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for \nlitigants.”). Thus, “a trial court may, with propriety, find it is efficient for its own \ndocket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a stay of an action before it, \npending resolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the case.” Canady v. \nErbe Elektromedizin GmbH, 271 F. Supp. 2d 64, 74 (D.D.C. 2002) (modifications \nomitted, quoting Leyva v. Certified Grocers of Cal., Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863-64 (9th \nCir. 1979)). \nCourts within this District routinely stay proceedings where resolution of an \nappeal in the same or a similar matter may guide the district court in deciding the \nissues before it. See, e.g., Univ. of Colo. Health Mem’l Hosp. v. Burwell, No. 14-cv-\n1220, 2017 WL 535246, at *12 (D.D.C. Feb. 9, 2017) (“Because many of the applicable \nissues  may  be  resolved  by  the  D.C.  Circuit,  and  because  the  D.C.  Circuit  may \notherwise provide instruction on the issues here, the Court finds a stay would serve \nthe interests of judicial efficiency.”); Allina Health Servs. v. Sebelius, 756 F. Supp. 2d \n61, 71 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding “good cause to stay this matter” given that “the parties \nagree that the resolution of [a related case] by the D.C. Circuit will be dispositive of \nthe Plaintiffs’ arguments here”); Tax Analysts & Advocates v. IRS, 405 F. Supp. 1065, \n1067 (D.D.C. 1975) (staying proceedings because “the Supreme Court could, in effect, \noverrule [a relevant precedent] should it choose to grant the petition for certiorari”); \ncf. Sumler v. Sovran Bank/DC Nat’l, No. 91-cv-3276, 1992 WL 315975, at *4 (D.D.C. \nOct. 14, 1992) (inviting the parties to request a stay because “it may be in the interest \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 4 of 14\nof judicial economy to stay these proceedings pending the Supreme Court’s decision” \nin a related matter). As these courts have recognized, it makes eminent sense for a \ndistrict court to refrain from deciding the very same issues that may soon be resolved \nby a binding appellate court. \nContinuing proceedings at this juncture would unnecessarily waste the Court’s \nand the parties’ resources. Given that many (if not all) of the critical legal issues \npresented in Plaintiffs’ complaint are now before the D.C. Circuit, it makes little \nsense for this Court (and the parties) to expend the resources necessary for further \nlitigation of those issues at this time. Because the preliminary injunction standard \nwill require the D.C. Circuit to consider whether Plaintiffs are “likely to succeed on \nthe merits,” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), it would be \nfar more efficient for the parties to await a decision from the D.C. Circuit, at which \npoint most (if not all) of the legal issues may then have definitive resolution and \nfurther  briefing  and  consideration  of  any  remaining  legal  issues  will  be  better \ninformed by having the benefit of the D.C. Circuit’s analysis. And while Plaintiffs \nargue that the Court should continue proceedings because if it enters final judgment \nthen the appeal may become moot, see infra at 8, the practical consequence of this \nwould effectively deprive Defendants of the opportunity to obtain appellate review of \nthe preliminary injunction, and instead require the appeal to start all over after final \njudgment. Thus, continuing proceedings would not only frustrate judicial economy in \nthis Court but in the appellate court as well. Accordingly, a stay would best “serve \nthe interests of judicial efficiency,” Univ. of Colo. Health Mem’l Hosp, No. 14-cv-1220, \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 5 of 14\n2017 WL 535246, at *12, and simplify the issues and questions of law the Court will \nneed to confront.  \nIn contrast to the significant waste of resources that will occur if this case \nproceeds, Plaintiffs will not suffer any harm from a stay. The preliminary injunction \nremains in effect while the appeal is litigated, thus there is no basis for concern about \nany continuing harms allegedly stemming from the challenged actions in this case. \nIn  this  regard,  Plaintiffs are not  situated  like  the  Plaintiffs in  Asylumworks v. \nMayorkas, No. 20-cv-3815, 2021 WL 2227335 (D.D.C. 2021), who were not under the \nprotection of a preliminary injunction, thus a stay would have imposed tangible \nhardship upon them due to the alleged harms stemming from the Government’s \nactions.  Notwithstanding  this  fact,  Plaintiffs  suggest  that  a  stay  would  “‘work \ndamage’ to [them]” because it would delay the development of a factual record. Infra \nat 11 (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 255). But this circular logic—that a stay of \nproceedings harms them because it stays the record development proceedings—does \nnot state a distinct harm particular to the positions of the parties in this case and \ndepends on the questionable proposition that delayed access to record evidence, \nuntied to any pressing need for that evidence, is somehow prejudicial. See In re Papst \nLicensing GmbH & Co. KG Pat. Litig., 320 F. Supp. 3d 132, 139 (D.D.C. 2018) (“a \n‘generalized claim’ that ‘memories will fade and discovery may likely be lost’ carries \n‘little weight’ in the absence of ‘any showing as to particular evidence or discovery \nthat is at risk of being lost.’” (quoting NFC Tech. LLC v. HTC Am., Inc., No. 2:13-CV-\n1058-WCB, 2015 WL 1069111 (E.D. Tex. 2015))). Furthermore, there is no basis to \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 6 of 14\nfear that delaying compilation of the record in this case would reduce its quality.  See \ninfra at 10.   \nAs this case arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), review is \ntypically limited to the agency’s administrative record, which is documentary in \nnature. 5 U.S.C. § 706; see Common Sense Salmon Recovery v. Evans, 217 F. Supp. \n2d 17, 20 (D.D.C. 2002) (there is a “basic rule that generally discovery is not permitted \nin Administrative Procedure Act cases because a court's review of an agency's decision \nis confined to the administrative record”). Plaintiffs believe, however, that discovery \noutside the administrative record may be needed here nonetheless. See infra at 11. \nThis departure from the standard course of APA litigation only further underscores \nhow continued merits proceedings in this case are likely to be burdensome. At a \nminimum, the parties would need to litigate—and the Court would need to resolve—\nany dispute about the propriety of discovery. And in the event that discovery is \ngranted,  there  may  well  be  privilege  disputes  and  other  issues  that  require \nsubstantial expenditure of the Court’s and the parties’ time and resources. All of those \nthings can and should be avoided while a potentially dispositive appeal is pending.  \nThe Court should therefore grant a stay of these proceedings because it is the \nmost  efficient  course  for  the  Court  and  the  parties,  and  neither  party  will  be \nprejudiced by a stay. \nBriefing Schedule \n \n  Should  the  court  deny  Defendants’  stay  request,  Defendants  respectfully \nsubmit the following briefing schedule for the Court’s consideration.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 7 of 14\n  First, Defendants respectfully request 30 days to produce the administrative \nrecord. Plaintiffs’ proposal that the administrative record be produced by May 14 fails \nto provide the Court with a meaningful opportunity even to rule on Defendants’ stay \nrequest, which the parties agreed to submit in connection with this May 9 filing.  \nMoreover, if a broader stay of proceedings is denied, Plaintiffs do not identify any \ncognizable prejudice stemming from receiving the administrative record in mid-June \nas  opposed  to  mid-May.  Although  Defendants  previously  proposed  that  May 14 \ndeadline, see ECF No. 55 at 6, that was before Defendants noticed their appeal of the \npreliminary injunction, ECF No. 62, before the parties agreed to submit this stay \nrequest to the Court for resolution, and also before the National Council of Nonprofits \n(and others) filed a new case against OMB (and other agencies) in the District of \nRhode Island raising similar claims and seeking still more emergency relief, see \nWoonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. USDA, No. 1:25-cv-97 (D.R.I), which \nhas  required  a  significant  expenditure  of  time  and  attention  to  litigate.  Thus, \nallowing 30 days for production of the administrative record is a reasonable approach \nthat would not prejudice the Plaintiffs. But at a minimum, Defendants respectfully \nrequest 14 days to produce the administrative record rather than the handful of \nbusiness days that Plaintiffs’ proposed deadline of May 14 would afford.  \nDefendants further propose that Plaintiffs move for summary judgment 30 \ndays after the administrative record is produced; Defendants submit a combined \nopposition and cross-motion for summary judgment 30 days later; Plaintiffs file a \ncombined opposition and reply 21 days later; Defendants file a reply 21 days later; \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 8 of 14\nand the Court holds a hearing on the cross-motions on a date most convenient to it \nfollowing submission of Defendants’ reply.   \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ POSITION \n \nStay of Proceedings Pending Appeal \n \n  Plaintiffs contacted Defendants on April 22 concerning when and in what \nformat Defendants intended to produce the administrative record—the normal next \nstep in an APA challenge such as this one. Defendants responded two days later \ninforming Plaintiffs that they would notice an appeal and seek a stay of proceedings \nin this Court. \n  Plaintiffs  oppose  a  stay.  To  begin,  there  appears  to  be  no  dispute  that \nDefendants’ appeal “does not divest [this C]ourt with jurisdiction to proceed with a \ndecision on the merits.” Jack’s Canoes & Kayaks, LLC v. Nat’l Park Serv., 937 F. \nSupp. 2d 18, 26 (D.D.C. 2013). The Court should do so here. \nThe discretionary choice whether to stay proceedings “calls for the exercise of \njudgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance.” \nLandis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1936). Where “there is even a fair \npossibility that the stay . . . will work damage to some one else,” the movant “must \nmake out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward” before \na court will stay proceedings. Id. at 255; see also, e.g., Asylumworks v. Mayorkas, No. \n20-cv-3815, 2021 WL 2227335, at *6 (D.D.C. June 1, 2021) (citing Landis and denying \nstay where “defendants fail[ed] to show that, absent a stay, the agency would suffer \nany hardship, save for the expenditure of resources in proceeding with the litigation”); \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 9 of 14\nCtr. for Biological Diversity v. Ross, 419 F. Supp. 3d 16, 21 (D.D.C. 2019) (citing \nLandis, denying stay, and noting government’s concession that “being required to \ndefend a suit, without more, does not constitute a ‘clear case of hardship or inequity’”); \nNat’l Indus. for Blind v. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 296 F. Supp. 3d 131, 140 (D.D.C. 2017) \n(citing Landis, denying stay, and emphasizing that “the burden of demonstrating a \nhardship that warrants staying properly filed legal proceedings is on the movant”) \n(K.B. Jackson, J.). \nHere,  a  stay  would  undermine,  not  promote,  judicial  efficiency  and  the \nexpeditious resolution of this case, including because it would pointlessly postpone \nfinal judgment until 2026 at the earliest. A stay also threatens to “work damage to” \nPlaintiffs because it would defer compilation of the administrative record—and the \ncompletion of any necessary discovery should the record be insufficient—into next \nyear,  by  which  point  memories  will  have  faded,  staff  may  have  changed,  and \ndocuments may be lost. Nor will Defendants be prejudiced if this case moves forward, \nmuch less face a “clear case of hardship or inequity,” as required in order to justify a \nstay. See Landis, 299 U.S. at 255. \n  First, efficiency and judicial economy favor allowing this litigation to proceed. \nFew steps should remain to bring this case to final judgment. Defendants must \nproduce the administrative record, which will likely not be burdensome given the \nspeed with which the decision at issue in this case was made. If the record is sufficient \nand complete—something that is entirely within the government’s control and should \nnot be difficult to ensure—the parties can then proceed to filing cross-motions for \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 10 of 14\nsummary judgment (motions that presumably will focus on issues the parties have \nbriefed, and the Court has considered, twice already). There is no apparent reason \nthe case could not reach final judgment before the preliminary injunction appeal is \neven decided, thus mooting that proceeding and allowing the D.C. Circuit to decide \nany future appeals at one go and on a complete record. Defendants’ proposal for \nextended two-step litigation—in which the parties and judiciary must devote a year \nor more to litigating Plaintiffs’ “likelihood” of prevailing before this Court can decide \nwhether Plaintiffs actually prevail—makes little sense and cannot be justified on \nefficiency grounds.  \n  Second, there is, at minimum, “a fair possibility that the stay . . . will work \ndamage to some one else.” See Landis, 299 U.S. at 255. That is because Defendants \nseek to postpone their obligation to produce the administrative record or any other \nneeded factual material for perhaps an additional year or more. That would “work \ndamage” to Plaintiffs not only by needlessly delaying their access to that information \nbut by materially increasing the risk that the same information will no longer be \navailable  when  Defendants  finally  turn  to  assembling  and  producing  the \nadministrative record sometime in 2026. This risk is heightened given that the \nadministrative  proceedings  here  did  not  take  place  in  the  ordinary  course  and \naccordingly, the record will require assembly by staff with actual knowledge of the \ndecisionmaking process at issue and, in particular, what materials were before then-\nActing Director Vaeth and any other relevant agency decisionmakers and what \nconsideration  they  gave  to  the  obvious  harmful  consequences  of  their  actions. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 11 of 14\nDefendants’ bare assertion that “there is no basis to fear” that the passage of a year \nor more before they even begin assembling the administrative record is cold comfort \nand overlooks that, under controlling law, the Court must ask whether there is “a fair \npossibility”—not  a  mathematical  certainty—that  the  stay  could  harm  Plaintiffs. \nSee Landis, 299 U.S. at 255. And the possibility of prejudice to Plaintiffs would grow \ngreater  still  in  the  event  the  record  is  incomplete  or  otherwise  in  need  of \nsupplementation  through  discovery,  given  that  “[u]nnecessary  delay  inherently \nincreases the risk that witnesses’ memories will fade and evidence will become stale.” \nPagtalunan v. Galaza, 291 F.3d 639, 643 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n  Because there is at minimum a “fair possibility” that a stay would “work \ndamage” to Plaintiffs, the government bears the burden in seeking the stay to “make \nout a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward.” Id. at 255. \nThe government fails to do so. The only harm it even suggests is that it may have to \n“waste [its] resources” continuing to litigate in this Court. But it is well established \nthat “being required to defend a suit, without more, does not constitute a ‘clear case \nof hardship or inequity.’” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 21; see also \nAsylumworks, 2021 WL 2227335, at *6. And even if ordinary litigation costs were \nrelevant, Defendants have not shown that seeing this case through to final judgment \nat this point would be particularly difficult or impose any special burden. Defendants \nfret that ordinary discovery would be burdensome, but discovery is likely in this case \nonly  if  the  Court  determines  that  Defendants  have  failed  to  assemble  a  record \nsufficient for it to resolve the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgement—a \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 12 of 14\npossibility that becomes more likely the more time passes. \n  The Court therefore should decline to stay proceedings. In the alternative, if \nthe Court is inclined to stay proceedings, it should do so only after the parties have \nfinished assembling the record, including completing any necessary discovery. \nBriefing Schedule \n  Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the Court should require the government to \nproduce the administrative record to Plaintiffs by May 14, the same date it is required \nto file a certified list of the contents of the administrative record with the Court. \nSee LCvR 7(n)(1). Defendants have already had significant time to assemble the \nrecord. And because they are already required to file the certified list of contents by \nthat date (and have been on notice of that obligation at least since the Court’s minute \norder of March 14, setting the deadline for Defendants to file their answer), it will \nimpose no additional burden for them to produce the record itself. Nor are Plaintiffs \nchallenging  the  kind  of  substantial  legislative  rulemaking  that  might  involve \nassembling years of relevant material; there is no reason to expect the administrative \nrecord here to be particularly difficult to compile. Plaintiffs have previously sought a \ndeadline for the production of the record, see ECF No. 55, at 2, and Defendants to \ndate have provided no reason why they should not be required to produce those \nmaterials.  \nTo the contrary, Defendants themselves previously requested that deadlines \nregarding the administrative record be “governed by the default timing provisions of \nLocal Civil Rule 7(n)(1).” Id. at 6. Having taken that position in response to Plaintiffs’ \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 64     Filed 05/09/25     Page 13 of 14\nrequest that they produce the record by March 25, id. at 2, Defendants should not be \nallowed to push back the goal posts further still. The excuses they now cite—that they \nhave noticed an appeal, have chosen to wait until the eve of the deadline they \nthemselves requested before asking for an extension (without explaining any need for \nthe extension), and are involved in another case concerning some of their other \nunlawful conduct—provide no basis for again delaying a straightforward and entirely \nordinary obligation that the government should expect in any APA case. \n  Following receipt of the administrative record, Plaintiffs respectfully request \nthat the Court allow 14 days for Plaintiffs to assess the adequacy of the record and \nthe need for any additional discovery. Should discovery be unnecessary, Plaintiffs \nagree that a summary judgment schedule roughly similar to the one Defendants have \nproposed would be appropriate—i.e., Plaintiffs’ opening motion to be due 30 days after \nany issues concerning the administrative record have been resolved; Defendants’ \ncombined response and cross-motion due 30 days later; Plaintiffs’ combined reply and \nresponse due 21 days later; and Defendants’ reply due 14 days after that. \n \n \nDated: May 9, 2025        Respectfully Submitted,     \n       \n              YAAKOV M.

And federal agencies are legally bound to follow those directives, to the \nextent permissible by law.  These uncontroversial principles govern this case and require its \ndismissal, consistent with binding D.C. Circuit precedent.  See, e.g., See Bldg. & Const. Trades \nDep’t v. Allbaugh, 295 F.3d 28, 32 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“[T]he President’s power necessarily \nencompasses  ‘general  administrative  control  of  those  executing  the  laws,’  throughout  the \nExecutive Branch of government, of which he is the head.” (quoting Myers v. United States, 272 \nU.S. 52, 164 (1926), citation omitted)); Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n(“[A]s an agency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s \npolicy directives to the extent permitted by law.”).   \nPlaintiffs’ opposition memorandum (ECF No. 24) scarcely acknowledges these principles, \nlet alone the degree to which their claims would intrude on the separation of powers.  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs’ lawsuit names a single agency as a defendant, and challenges a single agency action that \nhas now been withdrawn.  See Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Mem. M-25-13, \nTemporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs (Jan. 27, \n2025) (“OMB Memo”).  Yet Plaintiffs—only a handful of whom actually receive Federal grants—\nargue that they are entitled to sweeping relief, disabling every Executive Branch agency from \nimplementing the President’s agenda with respect to all grant recipients.  And Plaintiffs expressly \nrequest that this Court become an overseer of all Federal disbursements, with ongoing oversight \nthrough regular status reports.  There is simply no legal basis for such claims, and this entire lawsuit \nshould be dismissed for several reasons. \nFirst, Plaintiffs have not established standing to seek prospective relief.  Even were the \nCourt to consider the factual declarations submitted by Plaintiffs, they cannot overcome the \n-1- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 4 of 25\n \nfundamental  problem  that  it  is  speculative  whether  any  alleged  injuries  are  caused  by  the \nchallenged OMB Memo (as opposed to independent agency actions), or redressable by an Order \nfrom this Court against the OMB Memo.  Moreover, because this suit challenges only the OMB \nMemo, their claims against that Memo are moot. \nSecond, Plaintiffs make several important concessions narrowing the scope of their claims.  \nPlaintiffs concede that they cannot challenge the President’s Executive Orders, and they likewise \nconcede that they cannot challenge non-defendant agencies’ implementation of those Executive \nOrders.  These limitations on Plaintiffs’ claims are critical to avoid intruding even further into the \nExecutive Branch’s lawful authorities.  Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs’ claims are allowed to proceed \nin any fashion, the Court should codify these concessions in a dismissal Order confirming that \nPlaintiffs’ claims here are not challenging the President’s Executive Orders or non-defendant \nagencies’ implementation of those Orders. \nThird, even as to the OMB Memo, Plaintiffs are not challenging a discrete, final agency \naction.  The OMB Memo did not itself institute a pause or delay of any federal funding, and thus \nit did not determine legal rights or consequences.  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ efforts to characterize their \nclaims as challenging something broader than the OMB Memo—i.e., a “federal funding freeze” \napart from what’s reflected in the OMB Memo, Opp’n at 25—only underscores that they are \nbringing a broad programmatic challenge that, if allowed to proceed, will place this Court in the \nuntenable role of overseeing the entire Executive Branch’s funding decisions. \nFinally, on the merits, each of Plaintiffs’ claims fails.  Consistent with binding D.C. Circuit \nprecedent, the OMB Memo directs agencies to implement the President’s agenda to the extent \npermissible under each agency’s own authorities.  That is common, well within OMB’s statutory \nauthorities, and is not arbitrary and capricious—indeed, OMB was duty-bound to effectuate the \n-2- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 5 of 25\n \nPresident’s agenda.  Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim likewise fails because the Government is \nallowed to choose what programs it funds without running afoul of the First Amendment.  Nothing \nin the OMB Memo penalizes Plaintiffs for their speech, and instead the Memo directs agencies to \ninstitute a temporary pause in connection with determining the policies to which taxpayer money \nshould be directed.  That is not a First Amendment violation, and for all of these reasons, Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint should be dismissed in its entirety. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THIS COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS \nA.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Seek Prospective Relief \nNotwithstanding the additional information submitted in Plaintiffs’ Opposition, they still \nhave failed to establish “injury in fact” that is “fairly . . . traceable to the challenged action” and \n“redress[able] by a favorable decision.”   Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). \n1.  Injury in Fact \nFirst, Plaintiffs state in conclusory fashion that “Plaintiffs and their members will suffer \nconstitutional injury from the freeze’s direct burdening of their First Amendment rights of speech \nand association.”  Opp’n at 14.  Even for First Amendment claims, however, “in order to have \nstanding, an individual must present more than allegations of a subjective chill.  There must be a \nclaim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  Bigelow v. Virginia, \n421 U.S. 809, 816-17 (1975).  And here, Plaintiffs nowhere identify the specific expressive activity \nfor which they claim they are being penalized, or how the OMB Memo’s pause as to certain grants \ninvolving certain policies operates as a threat of harm to them specifically.  Apart from this \nclaimed  First  Amendment  interest,  Plaintiffs  have  conceded  that  the  non-grant-recipient \norganizations lack standing to sue in their own right, because they have not shown anything more \n“than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.”  Food & Drug Admin. v. \n-3- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 6 of 25\n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 394 (2024); Defs.’ MTD (ECF No. 21-1) at 9. \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that they have adequately alleged injury to those organizations \nthat directly receive Federal financial assistance—purportedly APHA and SAGE.  Opp’n at 15-\n16.  But Plaintiffs continue to rely on general assertions—for instance, that APHA “has long \nreceived federal grants and funds to carry out its mission.”  Id. at 15.  SAGE had one award that \nwas terminated prior to issuance of the OMB Memo, see ECF No. 5-2 ¶ 12, and it is speculative \nwhether their other grants would even be subject to the OMB Memo’s pause.  Cf. MTD at 9 (citing \nOMB Guidance, which stated that “OMB has worked with agencies and has already approved \nmany programs to continue even before the pause has gone into effect”).  Moreover, Plaintiffs still \ndo not provide any information about when APHA and SAGE next expect grant payments or \ndisbursements  under  their  relevant  federal  financial  assistance  programs,  making  it  wholly \nspeculative whether they would be affected by any temporary pause.  See MTD at 10.  Plaintiffs \nnevertheless  urge  that  these  alleged  injuries  are  not  speculative,  because  the  OMB  Memo \n“commands an indefinite and near-immediate halt” to Federal financial assistance.  Opp’n at 16.  \nBut as discussed previously, see MTD at 16-17, that broad characterization is contrary to the OMB \nMemo itself as well as OMB Guidance.  And in any event, this generalized assertion cannot \nsubstitute for specific information supporting the existence of an alleged direct injury to APHA or \nSAGE as a result of a temporary pause.  See Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560 (injury must be \n“actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”). \nThird,  regarding  associational  standing,  while  Plaintiffs  have  submitted  anonymous \ndeclarations from certain members of APHA, MSA, and NCN, see Opp’n at 16 (citing Exs. F-H, \nand K), those declarations cannot establish injury-in-fact sufficient for standing purposes, except \nas to challenges regarding funding of the specific set of programs described in those declarations.  \n-4- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 7 of 25\n \nAs an initial matter, Exhibit F to Plaintiffs’ Opposition purports to be a declaration from a member \nof MSA, but the declaration states that the individual joined MSA after the filing of this lawsuit, \nsee ECF No. 24-6 ¶ 22, and therefore it is irrelevant for standing purposes.  See Chamber of \nCommerce of U.S. v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[S]tanding is assessed as of the \ntime a suit commences.”).  Thus, at most, Plaintiffs only plausibly assert injury to a Plaintiff \nmember in Exhibits G, H, and K—which relate to a “homeless program[] for a community mental \nhealth  center,”  the  “Wisconsin  Shares  Child  Care  Subsidy”  program,  and  an  unnamed \n“demonstration project to try to address issues of infant mortality and premature birth.”  See ECF \nNo. 24-7 ¶ 5; ECF No. 24-8 ¶ 4; ECF No. 24-11 ¶ 14.  It is at best speculative whether, to the \nextent OMB were allowed to implement the temporary pause, any of those programs would be \nsubject to the pause given their apparent focus on providing assistance to individuals.  See OMB \nMemo at 1 n.1 (exempting “assistance received directly by individuals” from any pause); OMB \nGuidance at 1-2.  Regardless, the declarations only further emphasize the grant- and fact-specific \nnature of the standing analysis, and thus Plaintiffs cannot claim the requisite injury-in-fact for any \nrelief that applies beyond those specific programs.  See Appalachian Voices v. Bodman, 587 F. \nSupp. 2d 79, 86 (D.D.C. 2008) (plaintiffs only satisfied injury-in-fact requirement regarding \nproject site they “asserted that they use and enjoy” and not eight other identified sites that “they \nhave asserted absolutely no particularized connection to”).   \n2.  Causation \nEven assuming injury-in-fact, Plaintiffs fail to establish that any injury is caused by the \nchallenged OMB Memo, as opposed to independent federal agencies that administer the relevant \nprograms and are not party to this suit.  Plaintiffs respond that the OMB Memo “left agencies with \nno discretion.”  Opp’n at 17.  But the OMB Memo on its face does not determine which funds or \ngrants should be paused, but rather requires agencies to make that determination, consistent with \n-5- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 8 of 25\n \ntheir own authorities.  See MTD at 14; OMB Memo at 2 (instructing federal agencies to \ntemporarily pause certain activities only “to the extent permissible under applicable law”).  Thus, \nany temporary pause in funding would not necessarily be attributable to the OMB Memo itself, as \nopposed to an independent decision by a non-defendant agency pursuant to its own authorities. \nThis case is therefore quite similar to the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Louisiana v. Biden, 64 \nF.4th 674 (5th Cir. 2023), in which Louisiana sought to challenge an executive order requiring the \ncreation  of  certain  estimates  for  agencies  to  use,  as  consistent  with  applicable  law,  when \nconducting rulemakings.  See id. at 679.  The Fifth Circuit held that Louisiana lacked standing to \nbring its claims, including because any harms “are traceable to possible agency actions, not to [the \nexecutive order] or the Interim Estimates.”  Id. at 684.  Similarly here, even if the OMB Memo \ninfluences an agency’s exercise of its authorities, any temporary pause instituted by the agency \nwould be traceable to that independent agency’s action—not the OMB Memo. \nAs a factual matter, moreover, Plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate causation is further \ncrystallized by the fact that, after rescission of the OMB Memo, funding has allegedly resumed \nfor certain Plaintiffs, see, e.g., ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 15, but remains paused for others, see, e.g., ECF \nNo. 24-8 ¶ 11; ECF No. 24-11 ¶ 19.  That just further underscores how speculative it is which \nfunding pauses are traceable to the now-rescinded OMB Memo, as opposed to independent agency \nactions not subject to challenge in this case.  Indeed, as noted above, many of the declarations \nseem to describe assistance that would not be subject to the OMB Memo’s pause, either because \nthey involve assistance to individuals or Plaintiffs have not identified a clear link to an implicated \nExecutive Order.  See, e.g., ECF No. 24-6 ¶ 8 (describing grants funding “the development of a \nHyper-Compact  Neutron  Generator”);  ECF  No. 24-8  ¶¶ 4–8  (outlining  grant  program  for \n“demonstration project to try to address issues of infant mortality and premature birth”); ECF \n-6- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 9 of 25\n \nNo. 24-11 ¶ 2 (describing childcare services funded in part by grants); ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 6–10 \n(describing funding that has resumed for programs regarding the homeless); cf. OMB Memo at 1 \nn.1; OMB Guidance at 1-2.  Given that it is unclear on this record whether these programs fall \nwithin the scope of the OMB Memo’s intended pause, it is speculative whether any funding pause \nfor these programs was caused by the OMB Memo rather than the “independent action of [a] third \nparty” Federal agency.  Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560.   \n3.  Redressability \nPlaintiffs claim that “an injunction on implementation of the M-25-13 funding freeze[] \nclearly would redress” their alleged injuries.  Opp’n at 17.  But Plaintiffs allege pauses in funding \nby Federal agencies that are not parties to this lawsuit, and “nonparties” “would not be bound” by \nany injunction in this case.  Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023).  Thus, regardless of \nany injunction that could be entered here, those Federal agencies would remain free to pause \nfunding of federal financial assistance programs, pursuant to their own discretion or pursuant to \nthe relevant Executive Orders.  Plaintiffs assert that this is a “mere possibility,” Pls.’ Opp’n at 17, \nbut it is actually a necessary step for any of the Plaintiffs to obtain relief—i.e., unless and until the \nrelevant agencies exercise their own authorities and elect to disburse funds to Plaintiffs, any relief \nagainst the OMB Memo would not redress Plaintiffs’ injuries.  Thus, this Court cannot redress \nthese alleged injuries, since the federal agencies making independent decisions to pause funding \neven after the OMB Memo’s rescission are not parties to this lawsuit, and “an injunction” against \nthe OMB Memo “would not give [Plaintiffs] legally enforceable protection from the allegedly \nimminent harm.”  Brackeen, 599 U.S. at 293. \nB.  Plaintiffs’  Claims  Are  Moot  Because  the  Challenged  Action  Has  Been \nRescinded \nPlaintiffs’ only claims in this case challenge the OMB Memo and the only Defendants in \n-7- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 10 of 25\n \nthis case are OMB and the Acting Director of OMB.  See ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 5-6, 43-61.  And Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief is explicitly tied to the OMB Memo.  See id. at 18-19 (prayer for relief asking for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief relating to “Memo M-25-13”).  Because the OMB Memo has \nbeen rescinded, Plaintiffs’ claims are therefore moot.   \nIn arguing to the contrary, Plaintiffs first respond that the voluntary cessation doctrine \napplies here, largely relying on a conclusory assertion that they “can have no assurances that the \ngovernment will not simply resume implementing and enforcing the challenged policy going \nforward.”  Id. at 19.   However, Plaintiffs provide no factual basis for their assertion that the \ngovernment might reissue the challenged OMB Memo, and such an assumption would be contrary \nto the presumption of good faith that courts routinely accord the government when assessing \nvoluntary cessation.  See, e.g., Am. Cargo Transp., Inc. v. United States, 625 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th \nCir. 2010) (“The government’s change of policy presents a special circumstance in the world of \nmootness . . . unlike in the case of a private party, [the courts] presume the government is acting \nin  good  faith.”);  Sossamon  v.  Lone  Star  State  of  Texas,  560  F.3d  316,  325  (5th  Cir. \n2009) (“[G]overnment actors . . . are accorded a presumption of good faith because they are public \nservants, not self-interested private parties. Without evidence to the contrary, we assume that \nformally announced changes to official governmental policy are not mere litigation posturing.”); \nCoral  Springs  St.  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  City  of  Sunrise,  371  F.3d  1320,  1328–29  (11th  Cir.  2004) \n(“[G]overnmental entities and officials have been given considerably more leeway than private \nparties in the presumption that they are unlikely to resume illegal activities.”).   \nPlaintiffs  further  suggest  that  rescission  of  the  OMB  Memo  was  “an  attempt  at \nmanipulation of [the Court’s] jurisdiction.”  Opp’n at 19 (citation omitted).  But the only evidence \nPlaintiffs point to is a statement that demonstrates the opposite, i.e., a goal of ending confusion. \n-8- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 11 of 25\n \nSee id. at 10, 20.  This statement did not suggest the rescission was litigation posturing, as opposed \nto focusing on the legal effect of the President’s recent Executive Orders. \nNext,  Plaintiffs  assert  that  “Defendants  have  not  fully  stopped  the  challenged \nimplementation,” asserting that “payments on at least some open awards remain frozen, even those \nentirely unrelated to the substance of the executive orders cited in the Memo.”  Id. at 20.  As \ndiscussed above, however, Plaintiffs incorrectly assume that any paused funding must necessarily \nbe paused as a result of the now-rescinded OMB Memo.  Even assuming that some funding is \ncurrently frozen, Plaintiffs’ allegations of continuing adverse effects would not rescue Plaintiffs’ \nmoot claims to the extent that any ongoing freeze stems from other agency actions (not challenged \nin this case) besides the OMB Memo. \nWhile courts have ruled that claims are not moot where there are continuing adverse effects \non the parties, it is axiomatic that those continuing effects must arise from the challenged action.  \nSee Cnty. of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (explaining that, in order for a case \nto be mooted by voluntary action, “interim relief or events” must have “eradicated the effects of \nthe alleged violation” (emphasis added)); S.W. Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 168 F.3d 1344, 1350 (D.C. \nCir. 1999) (“Where an action has no continuing adverse impact and there is no relief that a court \nmay grant, any request for judicial review of the action is moot.” (emphasis added)); Miccosukee \nTribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, 259 F. Supp. 2d 1237, 1245 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 28, 2003) \n(“A request for declaratory relief should be dismissed as moot if the challenged conduct has no \ncontinuing adverse effects on the parties.” (emphasis added) (citing Super Tire Eng’g Co. v. \nMcCorkle, 416 U.S. 115, 122 (1974)).  Here, Plaintiffs cannot escape mootness given that ongoing \npauses in funding would not be attributable to the now-rescinded OMB Memo, but rather the result \nof independent and unchallenged action taken by government agencies that are not defendants in \n-9- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 12 of 25\n \nthis case.  See City of Houston, Tex. v. Dep’t of Housing & Urban Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1429 (D.C. \nCir. 1994) (“[I]f a plaintiff has made no challenge to some underlying policy, but merely attacks \nan isolated agency action, then the mooting of the specific claim moots any claim for a declaratory \njudgment that the specific action was unlawful.”).   \nNotably, Plaintiffs fail to cite any case law supporting an argument that allegations of \ncontinuing effects arising from separate action by other government agencies would be sufficient \nto overcome mootness.  Plaintiffs point to Row 1 Inc. v. Becerra, 92 F.4th 1138 (D.C. Cir. 2024), \nnoting that “the court found that allegations that contractors continued to apply the terms of [] \nrescinded letters were not moot.”  Opp’n at 21.  But that was a claim that the identical policy was \ncontinuing to be applied; here, any agency exercising its own discretion to institute a pause would \nnot be implementing the OMB-directed pause that Plaintiffs seek to challenge.  Moreover, \nPlaintiffs ignore that the Medicare contractors allegedly continuing to implement the rescinded \npolicy were also defendants in that case.  See Row 1 Inc. v. Becerra, No. 22-718, 2023 WL 183687, \nat *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 2023) (district court decision noting that Plaintiff brought claims against \n“several Medicare Administrative Contractors”).  Thus, it does not support Plaintiffs’ effort to \nescape mootness here based on effects caused by unchallenged actions of non-defendants. \nMeanwhile, the district court decision in Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida v. United \nStates is instructive.  In that case, the plaintiff challenged a water management decision by the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, called the Interim Structural and Operational Plan (“ISOP”).  See \n259 F. Supp. at 1239.  Later, the defendant adopted a superseding plan called the Interim Operating \nPlan (“IOP”).  See id. at 1242–43.  The court ruled that the plaintiff’s claim for declaratory relief \nwas mooted by the adoption of the IOP, despite plaintiff’s claims of continuing adverse effects \ngenerally caused by the defendant’s policies and procedures.  See id. at 1245.  The court noted that \n-10- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 13 of 25\n \n“[a]lthough the IOP certainly appears to incorporate many elements of the ISOPs, which the \n[plaintiff] alleges have harmed and continue to harm its interests, the IOP supercedes both the \nISOP that prompted this litigation and the ISOP 2001 upon which the Supplemental Complaint \nwas based.”  Id.  “Thus, the ISOP and ISOP 2001 are already of no further legal force and effect” \nand “cannot be said to have a continuing adverse effect on the [plaintiff].”  Id.  Therefore, since \nany grant of relief on the plaintiff’s claims “would have no effect on the IOP now in place,” \nplaintiff’s claims for declaratory relief were moot and any declaration “would constitute an \nimpermissible advisory opinion.”  Id.  Similarly, here, Plaintiffs’ Complaint only challenges and \nasks for relief regarding the OMB Memo, and even if they assert that other Federal agencies have \nimplemented policies that share elements of the now-rescinded OMB Memo, the OMB Memo is \nnot in effect and therefore “cannot be said to have a continuing adverse effect” on Plaintiffs.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs therefore have not established jurisdiction under both standing and mootness. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE NOT OTHERWISE JUDICIALLY COGNIZABLE \nA.  Plaintiffs Concede That They Cannot Challenge the President’s Executive \nOrders or Unnamed Agencies’ Implementation of Those Orders \nImportantly, Plaintiffs’ opposition concedes two critical points that narrow the scope of \ntheir claims.  To the extent this Court allows Plaintiffs’ claims to proceed in some fashion, \ntherefore, Plaintiffs’ claims must be limited in scope and should expressly not extend to the \nPresident’s Executive Orders or nondefendant agencies’ implementation of those Orders. \nFirst, Plaintiffs concede that they cannot seek relief directly against the President or his \nExecutive Orders.  See MTD at 12-13. It is well-established that courts have no authority to \nsecond-guess “discretion[ary]” acts taken by the President “in the performance of his official \nduties.”  Mississippi  v.  Johnson,  71  U.S.  (4  Wall.)  475,  501  (1867);  see  also  Franklin  v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part); Newdow v. Roberts, 603 \n-11- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 14 of 25\n \nF.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010).   \nSecond, Plaintiffs also concede that they cannot challenge the actions of unnamed agencies \nwho are not defendants in this action.  See MTD at 11-12.  That includes those unnamed agencies’ \nongoing implementation of the President’s Executive Orders.  See id. at 13-16.  Indeed, Plaintiffs \nexpressly disavow any intent to challenge the Executive Orders or other unnamed agencies’ \nactions.  See Opp’n at 25 (although “the government spills a great deal of ink . . . on the propriety \nof  the  executive  orders  themselves,  and  agency  implementation,”  that  “fundamentally \nmisapprehends Plaintiffs’ claims”). \nAccordingly, even if this Court allows certain claims to survive, this Court should expressly \nconfirm that Plaintiffs are not permitted to challenge the President’s Executive Orders or unnamed \nagencies’ implementation of those Orders, and that any such claims are dismissed. \nB.  The OMB Memo Is Not Discrete, Final Agency Action \nEven as to Plaintiffs’ claims against the OMB Memo, those claims are not justiciable \nbecause Plaintiffs do not challenge discrete, final agency action. \nFirst, Plaintiffs continue to ignore that the OMB Memo did not direct that any particular \nfunding be paused.  Instead, OMB instructed that agencies must determine whether to temporarily \npause funding implicated by the Executive Orders, as consistent with the law.  See OMB Memo \nat 2.  Thus, the OMB Memo itself did not determine legal consequences.  Cf. Fund for Animals, \nInc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Plaintiffs contend that “decisions \ninvolving the approval of a particular grant or the terms on which grants will be extended constitute \nfinal agency action,” Opp’n at 22, but their citations only further prove the point—their cited cases \nall involve suits against the agency actually administering the grant funding, not a claim against a \nprecursor memorandum issued by a separate agency like the OMB Memo here.   \nPlaintiffs also contend that the OMB Memo is final because it “effectively binds the \n-12- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 15 of 25\n \nagencies to which it is directed, withdrawing their previously-held discretion.”  Opp’n at 23 \n(cleaned up).  But the OMB Memo does not withdraw agency discretion; it reaffirms that agencies \nmust make their own determination as to the legality of any pause.  That is fundamentally different \nthan Plaintiffs’ cited authority, which involved creation of a “safe harbor” that precluded an agency \nfrom acting in the relevant circumstances.  Scenic Am., Inc. v. Dep’t of Transportation, 836 F.3d \n42, 56 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  And to the extent any agency discretion may have been withdrawn, that \nwould have resulted from the policies set forth in the President’s Executive Orders—not any OMB-\nordered pause.  Cf. OMB Guidance at 1 (“Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive \nOrders is not subject to the pause.”).1 \nIn an effort to avoid some of the justiciability problems stemming from withdrawal of the \nOMB Memo, Plaintiffs try to broaden their claims—characterizing them as not just challenging \nthe OMB Memo, but more broadly seeking relief against “the federal funding freeze” that \n“emanates from the Memo.”  Opp’n at 25.  But this effort to recharacterize their claims only further \nunderscores that Plaintiffs are bringing a wide-ranging programmatic challenge, not a challenge to \ndiscrete agency action.  Just as in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871 (1990), there \nwas no such thing as a “land withdrawal review program” because that was “simply the name by \nwhich petitioners have occasionally referred to the continuing (and thus constantly changing) \noperations of the BLM,” id. at 890, the same is true for the “funding freeze” here.  There is no \nsingular “funding freeze,” but rather that is the name Plaintiffs attribute to the thousands of \n \n1 Plaintiffs also cite National Mining Association v. Jackson, 768 F. Supp. 2d 34, 41–45 \n(D.D.C. 2011), see Opp’n at 24-25. But the final agency action analysis in that opinion appears to \nhave been overruled by Judge Kavanaugh’s subsequent opinion in National Mining Association v. \nMcCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2014), which held that the EPA guidance was not \nreviewable because it “imposes no obligations or prohibitions on regulated entities.”  Similarly \nhere, the OMB Memo imposes no obligations on individual grant recipients (who are the purported \nregulated entities in Plaintiffs’ view, see Opp’n at 15).   \n-13- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 16 of 25\n \nindividual decisions made by agencies about whether particular grants or other funding should be \npaused.  Indeed, Plaintiffs effectively admitted as much at the TRO hearing, stating that their \nclaims seek relief on behalf of “tens of thousands of members” potentially affected by the “many, \nmany grant programs across the country.” Tr. of Jan. 28 Hrg. at 6.   \nPlaintiffs also fail to meaningfully address the inevitable compliance difficulties that would \narise if their amorphous claims were allowed to proceed.  See MTD at 15-16.  Plaintiffs insist that \n“tailored relief” is available, Opp’n at 25, but they fail to acknowledge that, in their view, an \ninjunction against the OMB Memo would require this Court to superintend grant disbursements \nthroughout the entire federal government, as confirmed by their own Complaint.  See Prayer for \nRelief, ¶ (c) (requesting an order that Defendants file periodic status reports “confirming the \nregular disbursement and obligation of federal financial assistance funds”).   \nMoreover,  the  administrative  stay  itself  highlights  such  difficulties.    For  example, \nPlaintiffs’ opposition repeatedly asserts noncompliance with the Court’s stay order based on a \nstatement that the President’s Executive Orders remain in effect.  See, e.g., Opp’n at 2, 20.  \nDefendants understood, however, that pauses due to the Executive Orders (and other reasons apart \nfrom the OMB Memo) were not encompassed within the administrative stay, as discussed at the \nTRO hearing.  See, e.g., TRO Hrg. Tr. at 27 (“If there are executive order reasons or rationales for \nthe termination of other grants either before or after OMB’s guidance, perhaps they fall into the \ncase as we proceed but they would not be subject to the administrative stay.”); id. at 29 (“So \nanything that was terminated pursuant to other executive orders I think is fodder for another \nlawsuit.”).  The inability to fashion specific relief against the OMB Memo (let alone to a “federal \nfunding freeze” that “emanates from the Memo”) is because the OMB Memo is not discrete agency \naction, but rather a collection of countless independent agency actions.  That is an inherent flaw in \n-14- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 17 of 25\n \nPlaintiffs’ claims, which requires their dismissal.  \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE ANY VALID CLAIMS \nA.  The D.C. Circuit Has Confirmed that Agencies Are Required to Implement \nthe President’s Agenda, Consistent with Law, Which Is All That the OMB \nMemo Requires \nPlaintiffs  do  not  dispute  the  fundamental  proposition  that  the  President  may  direct \nsubordinate agencies to implement his agenda, to the extent permissible by law.  See, e.g., Sherley, \n689 F.3d at 784 (“[A]s an agency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement \nthe President’s policy directives to the extent permitted by law.”); Allbaugh, 295 F.3d at 32 (“[T]he \nPresident’s power necessarily encompasses ‘general administrative control of those executing the \nlaws,’ throughout the Executive Branch of government, of which he is the head.” (quoting Myers, \n272 U.S. at 164, citation omitted)).  That is all that the OMB Memo requires and what it is intended \nto accomplish, and therefore the Memo is lawful. \nPlaintiffs contend that “boilerplate” language in the OMB Memo about complying with the \nlaw cannot “insulate the [Memo] from attack.”  Opp’n at 26.  But the relevant proviso (“to the \nextent permissible under applicable law”) was not boilerplate included only one time—it was \nrepeated in multiple places, see OMB Memo at 2, as well as throughout the subsequent OMB \nGuidance, at 1-2.  Thus, the OMB Memo is legal, just like the executive order at issue in Allbaugh \nthat contained similar language.  295 F.3d at 33 (“In the Executive Order, the President directs his \nsubordinates how to proceed in administering federally funded projects, but only ‘to the extent \npermitted by law.’” (modifications omitted)). \nPlaintiffs’ only response to Allbaugh is to portray it as being rooted in “the slow-moving \nand complex world of government contracting[.]”  Opp’n at 26.  But the challengers in Allbaugh \ncertainly did not view government contracting that way.  See 295 F.3d at 33 (upholding executive \norder, even in the face of argument that “it is untenable to require each federal grantee . . . to \n-15- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 18 of 25\n \nchallenge a threatened denial of funds . . . because projects are planned and conducted on tight and \ncritical timeframes”).  And in any event, the D.C. Circuit’s decision was not rooted in the factual \ncontext of government contracting; it was based on the President’s Article II authority to direct \nsubordinate agencies to implement his agenda.  See id. at 32 (“Those [executive] officers are duty-\nbound to give effect to the policies embodied in the President’s direction, to the extent allowed by \nthe law.”); see also Common Cause v. Trump, 506 F. Supp. 3d 39, 47 (D.D.C. 2020). \nThe Allbaugh decision therefore reveals an overarching flaw in all of Plaintiffs’ claims.  It \nis not unlawful for OMB to tell agencies to implement the President’s agenda consistent with the \nlaw, as those agencies are already required to do.  Nor can Plaintiffs simply assume that agencies \nwill pause funding in a manner that violates the First Amendment or other legal constraints, \ncontrary to the directions in the OMB Memo itself.  See Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, Inc. v. \nVolpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415 (1971) (agencies are “entitled to a presumption of regularity”).  Because \ntheir claims necessarily require assuming that agencies will not follow the directive in the OMB \nMemo to act consistent with the law, Plaintiffs’ claims all fail. \nB.  OMB Undoubtedly Has Authority to Advise Agencies on Implementing the \nPresident’s Budget Directives \nEven ignoring Allbaugh, Plaintiffs’ claims still fail for numerous reasons.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that OMB lacks statutory authority to temporarily pause funds, Opp’n at 27, but they \nignore that the central purpose of OMB—approved by Congress in connection with the President’s \nreorganization plan—is to “assist[] the President in the preparation of the annual Federal budget \nand oversee[] its execution.” Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, Message of the President, 5 \nU.S.C. App’x 1, reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6315, 6316 (emphasis added).   \nEven based on the authorities in 31 U.S.C. § 503, OMB has authority to issue “policies and \ndirectives,” including with respect to “[m]onitor[ing] the financial execution of the budget” and \n-16- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 19 of 25\n \n“[p]rovid[ing] overall direction and leadership to the executive branch on financial management \nmatters.”  31 U.S.C. § 503(a)(2), (5), (14).  Those authorities, naturally read, plainly extend to \nproviding instructions to agencies on temporary pauses in funding to ensure that such funding is \nconsistent with the President’s priorities. \nAs noted, temporary pauses in funding are commonplace, see MTD at 21, yet Plaintiffs’ \ntheory would nonsensically forbid OMB from providing instructions to agencies in all such \ncircumstances.  In response to the documented history of funding pauses, Plaintiffs argue that the \nD.C. Circuit in City of New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1987), “held \ninvalid the law under which the administration had acted,” Opp’n at 29.  But the invalidity was \nbased on an unconstitutional legislative veto—not a determination that delays in funding were \ninherently unlawful as Plaintiffs imply.   \nPlaintiffs also contend that “Defendants muster no precedent remotely resembling the \nbroad, indefinite freeze OMB ordered.”  Opp’n at 28.  But again, that is a distorted characterization \nof the OMB Memo, particularly in light of the OMB Guidance.  Regardless, it is common for \nPresidents  to  pause  different  types  of  agency  action—including  funding—based  on  policy \nconcerns, including directing pauses that are effective immediately and are longer in duration than \nwhat the OMB Memo contemplated here.  See, e.g., Procl. No. 10,142, Termination of Emergency \nWith Respect to the Southern Border of the United States and Redirection of Funds Diverted to \nBorder Wall Construction, 86 Fed. Reg. 7225 (Jan. 20, 2021), § 1(a)(ii) (directing agencies to \n“pause immediately the obligation of funds related to construction of the southern border wall, to \nthe extent permitted by law,” with no specific end date but requiring a plan within 60 days); \nEnsuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, 74 Fed. Reg. 12531 (Mar. 20, 2009), \n§ 2(d)(i) (“Where legally permissible, the department or agency shall . . . delay funding of the \n-17- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 20 of 25\n \nproject for 30 days[.]”); see also, e.g., Exec. Order. No. 14,008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at \nHome and Abroad, 86 Fed. Reg. 7619 (Jan. 27, 2021), § 208 (“To the extent consistent with \napplicable law, the Secretary of the Interior shall pause new oil and natural gas leases on public \nlands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review,” with no specific end \ndate); Exec. Order No. 13990, Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring \nScience To Tackle the Climate Crisis, 86 FR 7037 (Jan. 20, 2021), § 4(a) (“[T]he Secretary of the \nInterior shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, place a temporary moratorium on \nall activities of the Federal Government relating to the implementation of the Coastal Plain Oil and \nGas Leasing Program,” with no specific end date).  Plaintiffs’ statutory theory would preclude \nOMB from implementing any of these measures, a proposition squarely at odds with Article II and \nthe D.C. Circuit’s decisions recognizing the President’s authority to direct agencies to effectuate \nhis agenda.  OMB, as the primary overseer of budget execution, may lawfully assist the President \nby instructing agencies on how to administer their funding consistent with law. \nC.  A Temporary Pause in Funding Is Not Arbitrary and Capricious \nWhen the Founders designed the Executive Branch under Article II, “they sought to \nencourage energetic, vigorous, decisive, and speedy execution of the laws.”  Clinton v. Jones, 520 \nU.S. 681, 712 (1997).  Plaintiffs now argue those very features of the OMB Memo are so irrational \nas to be legally invalid.  But there is nothing irrational about a temporary pause in funding, to the \nextent permissible by law, pending a review to ensure compliance with the President’s priorities.  \nThat is precisely what OMB and other subordinate agencies are legally required to do; it cannot \nbe irrational for them to comply with the law in such a manner.  Sherley, 689 F.3d at 784 (“[A]s \nan agency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s policy \ndirectives to the extent permitted by law.”).  Indeed, requiring a federal agency to articulate a \nrationale for its action—beyond simple compliance with the President’s directives—would, in \n-18- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 21 of 25\n \nessence, subject the President’s directive to arbitrary and capricious review, contrary to the \nprinciple that the President is not an agency under the APA.  Franklin, 505 U.S. at 800-01. \nIn any event, the OMB Memo cogently explains that a temporary pause is necessary to \n“provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the \nfunding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities.”  OMB Memo. \nat 2.  This directly connects to the stated goal of “safeguard[ing] valuable taxpayer resources.”  Id. \nat 1.  Plaintiffs argue that “Defendants failed to provide any cogent explanation for why any \n‘assessment’ . . . could not have occurred while funding continues disbursement as usual.”  Opp’n \nat 31.  But the answer is simple: resources are finite, and the Executive is entitled to ensure that all \nfunding aligns with the President’s priorities to the extent permissible by law.  The Executive’s \npolicy judgment to conserve federal resources in that manner should not be subject to “judicial \nsecond-guessing of agency discretion.”  Crumpton v. Stone, 59 F.3d 1400, 1406 (D.C. Cir. 1995); \nsee also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (the scope of review under the “arbitrary and capricious” \nstandard is “narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”).   \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestion, the OMB Memo does not “fail[] to take into account the \nobvious and immediate harms produced by abruptly halting . . . assistance.”  Opp’n at 30.  First, \nrecognizing  potential  consequences  for  individuals,  the  OMB  Memo  exempted  “assistance \nprovided directly to individuals,” specifically mentioning “Medicare or social security benefits.”  \nOMB Memo at 1 nn.1-2; see also OMB Guidance at 1-2.  Second, the OMB Memo recognized \nthat, despite the need for a pause and review of certain assistance, there may be some particular \ncircumstances warranting a different approach, and thus provided for a safety valve: “OMB may \ngrant exceptions allowing Federal agencies to issue new awards or take other actions on a case-\nby-case basis.”  OMB Memo at 2.  Third, the OMB Memo was explicit that it directed only a \n-19- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 22 of 25\n \ntemporary pause and review, not anything more significant such as outright cancellation of any \ngrants.  And fourth, the OMB Memo provided a delayed effective date, with OMB acting quickly \neven before that effective date to “approve[] many programs to continue even before the pause has \ngone into effect.”  OMB Guidance at 1.  Those efforts do not reflect wholesale ignoring of real-\nworld consequences, but rather an attempt to balance those consequences with the stated objectives \nof “act[ing] as faithful stewards of taxpayer money” and ensuring that federal programs “are being \nexecuted in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.”  Id. at 2.   \nTo the extent Plaintiffs disagree with OMB’s weighing of the possible consequences, this \nreflects only a difference in policy perspective.  And Plaintiffs do not dispute that, under their \ntheory, the President and OMB would be required to provide agencies a specific period of time \nbefore those agencies could be directed to take actions to implement the President’s agenda, lest \nsuch actions be deemed arbitrary and capricious.  That result would be squarely at odds with past \nAdministrations’ Executive Orders directing immediate pauses in certain activities, including \ndisbursement of funds.  Particularly in light of this history and the impractical nature of Plaintiffs’ \ntheory, OMB’s reasoning here was sufficient to “meet[] a minimum rationality standard” that \nentitles it to a “presumpti[on] [of] valid[ity].”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 353 F.3d 976, 978 (D.C. Cir. \n2004) (citation omitted). \nAs for reliance interests, Plaintiffs still do not carry their burden of proving specific \ninterests in the particular timing of any grant funding.  And OMB’s instruction to agencies to \nimplement the pause, to the extent permissible by law, does not foreclose agency consideration of \nany such interests.  It is perfectly rational for OMB to expect agencies, as the ones who actually \nadminister grants and know their terms, to determine whether a temporary pause is appropriate for \nthat particular grant and its grantees.  \n-20- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 23 of 25\n \nIn short, there is nothing irrational about the OMB Memo’s acting expeditiously to place a \ntemporary pause on certain forms of assistance, to the extent permissible by law, pending a review \nto ensure the fundings’ usage aligns with Presidential priorities and is not contributing to wasteful \nspending, as OMB (and individual agencies) are required to do. Sherley, 689 F.3d at 784. \nD.  The  Government  May  Implement  Its  Policy  Views  Through  Financial \nAssistance Programs Without Running Afoul of the First Amendment \n“When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining \nthe content of what it says . . . [t]hus, government statements (and government actions and \nprograms that take the form of speech) do not normally trigger the First Amendment rules designed \nto protect the marketplace of ideas.”  Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 \nU.S. 200, 207 (2015).  Moreover, as Defendants originally explained (and Plaintiffs do not \ncontest), so long as the government follows existing law, as the OMB Memo and Executive Orders \ndirect, the Administration “‘may make value judgment[s]’” and “‘implement th[ose] judgment[s] \nby the allocation of public funds.’”  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192-93 (1991) (quoting Maher \nv. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 474 (1977)).  Those principles foreclose Plaintiffs’ claim here. \nPlaintiffs criticize certain language in the OMB Memo (and the President’s Executive \nOrders), Opp’n at 32, but that is nothing more than Plaintiffs’ policy disagreements masquerading \nas a First Amendment claim.  The OMB Memo does not restrict Plaintiffs’ speech, but rather \nimplements the Government’s own speech, which Plaintiffs cannot use the First Amendment to \nchallenge.  Cf. Walker, 576 U.S. at 207 (“[T]he Free Speech Clause helps produce informed \nopinions among members of the public, who are then able to influence the choices of a government \nthat, through words and deeds, will reflect its electoral mandate.”).  \nPlaintiffs accuse the OMB Memo of being an effort to “facilitate the identification of and, \nultimately, termination of funding for certain recipients.” Opp’n at 34.  But the OMB Memo’s \n-21- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 24 of 25\n \npause applies evenly to all recipients in the programs implicated by the President’s Executive \nOrders. And the Executive, as part of its authority to choose what activities to fund, need not be \nneutral as to the programs it seeks to review.  Any contrary rule would essentially foreclose the \nGovernment from ever pausing or modifying only certain programs.  \nNor can the OMB Memo reasonably be portrayed as “a promise that dissenters will be \npunished through the loss of already awarded federal financial assistance.”  OMB Memo at 32.  \nThe  text  of  the  Memo  emphasizes  that  it  is  focused  on  “safeguard[ing]  valuable  taxpayer \nresources” and undoing certain policies that do not align with the President’s agenda.  OMB Memo \nat 1.  Again, choosing which policies to fund is not a First Amendment violation for the potential \nrecipients of such funding.  Cf. O’Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 725 \n(1996) (“If the government terminates its affiliation with a service provider for reasons unrelated \nto political association . . . there will be no First Amendment violation. These are choices and \npolicy considerations that ought to remain open to government officials when deciding to contract \nwith some firms and not others.”).  \nFinally, Plaintiffs invoke the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, Opp’n at 33, but they \nstill do not specify any new condition that has been imposed.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that the \ngovernment “can, without offending the Constitution, selectively fund certain programs to address \nan issue of public concern, without funding alternative ways of addressing the same problem.” \nAgency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 217 (2013) (citing Rust, 500 \nU.S. at 173).  They also cite Archdiocese of Washington v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. \nfor the point that “the government may place speech-restrictive conditions on participation in its \nprograms if those conditions are confined to the scope of the program.”  897 F.3d 314, 336 (D.C. \nCir. 2018).  The OMB Memo is well within those principles, and Plaintiffs’ theory would transform \n-22- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 26     Filed 02/01/25     Page 25 of 25\n \nevery pause or suspension in grant funding on policy grounds into a First Amendment violation.  \nSee Opp’n at 34 (arguing that “the freeze will deprive existing recipients of funding they have \nalready  been  determined  eligible  for”  and  therefore  violates  the  unconstitutional  conditions \ndoctrine).  That theory is untenable, and Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim is meritless and should \nbe dismissed. \nCONCLUSION \nThis entire action should be dismissed, because Plaintiffs have not established this Court’s \nsubject-matter jurisdiction and they fail to state any claims upon which relief may be granted.  \n \n \nDated: February 1, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n          BRETT A.

In practice, the Memo purports to eradicate essentially all \nfederal grant programs. Acting Director Vaeth’s only stated basis for doing so is his \nbelief that “[f]inancial assistance should be dedicated to advancing Administration \npriorities,” and that “[t]he use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, \ntransgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer \ndollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve.” Id. at 1. \nThis Memo—made public only through journalists’ reporting, with barely twenty-\nfour hours’ notice, devoid of any legal basis or the barest rationale—will have a \ndevastating impact on hundreds of thousands of grant recipients who depend on the \ninflow of grant money (money already obligated and already awarded) to fulfill their \nmissions, pay their employees, pay their rent—and, indeed, improve the day-to-day lives \nof the many people they work so hard to serve. \n \n1 A copy of the Memo is available online at: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/deb7af80-48b6-4b8a-8bfa-\n3d84fd7c3ec8.pdf. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 3 of 20\n \n \nAlthough the Trump Administration is at liberty to “advanc[e] [its] priorities,” it \nmust do so within the confines of the law. It has not. The Memo fails to explain the \nsource of OMB’s purported legal authority to gut every grant program in the federal \ngovernment; it fails to consider the reliance interest of the many grant recipients, \nincluding those to whom money had already been promised; and it announces a policy of \ntargeting grant recipients based in part on those recipients’ First Amendment rights and \nwith no bearing on the recipients’ eligibility to receive federal funds.   \nGiven the few hours that remain before federal grantees are thrown into disarray, \nPlaintiffs file this Complaint and seek a temporary restraining order to maintain the status \nquo until the Court has an opportunity to more fully consider the illegality of OMB’s \nactions. \nParties \n1.  Plaintiff National Council of Nonprofits (“NCN”) is the largest network \nof nonprofit organizations in North America, with more than 30,000 organizational \nmembers. National Council of Nonprofits (“NCN”) supports nonprofits in advancing \ntheir missions by identifying emerging trends, sharing proven practices, and promoting \nsolutions that benefit charitable nonprofits and the communities they serve. \n2.  Plaintiff American Public Health Association (“APHA”) is a \nnonpartisan, non-profit organization that champions the health of all people and all \ncommunities; strengthens the profession of public health; shares the latest research and \ninformation; promotes best practices; and advocates for public health issues and policies \ngrounded in scientific research. APHA represents more than 23,000 individual members, \nwho reside in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and also has 52 \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 4 of 20\n \n \nstate and regional affiliates. APHA is the only organization that combines a 150-year \nperspective, a broad-based member community, and the ability to influence federal policy \nto improve the public’s health.  \n3.  Plaintiff Main Street Alliance (“MSA”) is a national network of small \nbusinesses, which represents approximately 30,000 small businesses across the United \nStates. MSA helps small business owners realize their full potential as leaders for a just \nfuture that prioritizes good jobs, equity, and community through organizing, research, \nand policy advocacy on behalf of small businesses. MSA also seeks to amplify the voices \nof its small business membership by sharing their experiences with the aim of creating an \neconomy where all small business owners have an equal opportunity to succeed. MSA’s \nsmall business members compete for and receive various forms of what is broadly \ndefined as “federal financial assistance,” including funding in the form of grants, loans, \nand loan guarantees. Members also benefit directly from other recipients of federal \nfinancial assistance being able to purchase goods and services from them as a result of \nfederal programs. \n4.  Plaintiff SAGE is a New York nonprofit corporation. SAGE is dedicated \nto improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults.  \n5.  Defendant OMB is a federal agency with responsibility for overseeing the \nmanagement of federal financial assistance, including by establishing policies and \nrequirements. See 31 U.S.C. §§ 503(a), 504. It is a component of the Executive Office of \nthe President and maintains a headquarters in Washington, D.C. \n6.  Defendant Matthew Vaeth is the Acting Director of OMB. He is sued in \nhis official capacity.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 5 of 20\n \n \nJurisdiction and Venue \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, because this action arises under federal law, specifically the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq.  \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(e), because at least one of Defendants is headquartered in Washington, \nD.C. and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims \noccurred here. \nLegal Framework  \n9.  The Office of Management and Budget has the authority to “establish \ngovernmentwide financial management policies for executive agencies.” 31 U.S.C. §§ \n503(a), 504. That authority, given by Congress to the Deputy Director for Management \nand the Office of Federal Financial Management, includes the authority to “[p]rovide \noverall direction and leadership to the executive branch on financial management matters \nby establishing financial management policies and requirements.” Id. § 503(a)(2).  \n10.  Pursuant to that authority, OMB published in 2013 a notice of proposed \nrulemaking to revise and streamline guidance related to federal financial assistance.  \n11.  In 2014, it published what is now known as the OMB Guidance for \nFederal Financial Assistance (“OMB Guidance” or “Guidance”) at title 2 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations (“CFR”). 79 Fed. Reg. 75867.   \n12.   The Guidance specifically requires federal agencies to “implement” the \nGuidance “in codified regulations unless different provisions are required by Federal \nstatute or are approved by OMB.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.106. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 6 of 20\n \n \n13.  Since 2014, OMB has twice updated its Guidance—both times after \nproviding a notice and comment period. See 85 Fed. Reg. 49506 (2020); 89 Fed. Reg. \n30046 (2024).  \nFactual Allegations  \n14.  On January 27, 2025, Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director of the Office of \n  \nManagement and Budget, issued the Memo, titled “Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, \nLoan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs.”  \n15.  The Memo directs each federal agency to “complete a comprehensive \nanalysis of all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, \nprojects, and activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive \norders.”   \n16.  The Memo states that, during their assessment, all federal agencies “must \ntemporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal \nfinancial assistance, and other relevant agency actions that may be implicated by the \nexecutive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, \nnongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal” \n(emphasis in original).  \n17.  According to the Memo, “Federal financial assistance includes: (i) all \nforms of assistance listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of this term at 2 CFR \n200.1; and (ii) assistance received or administered by recipients or subrecipients of any \ntype except for assistance received directly by individuals.”   \n18.  The relevant portions of 2 C.F.R. 200.1 defining “federal financial \nassistance” broadly encompass all “[a]ssistance that recipients or subrecipients receive or \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 7 of 20\n \n \nadminister in the form of” “grants,” “loans,” “loan guarantees,” and “insurance,” among \nother things. \n19.  The Memo specifically carves out Medicare or Social Security benefits.  \n20.  Agencies are also directed to “pause all activities associated with open \nNOFOs, such as conducting merit review panels.” NOFO stands for “notice of funding \nopportunity” and refers to a formally issued announcement of the availability of federal \nfunding. \n21.  The OMB Memo orders that the “pause” take effect on January 28, 2025 \nat 5 p.m. The OMB Order does not provide an end date for the pause.   \n22.  Agencies are required to report by February 10, 2025 to OMB “detailed \ninformation on any programs, projects or activities subject to this pause. Each agency \nmust pause (i) issuance of new awards; (ii) disbursement of Federal funds under all open \nawards; and (iii) other relevant agency actions that may be implicated by the executive \norders, to the extent permissible by law, until OMB has reviewed and provided guidance \nto your agency with respect to the information submitted.”   \n23.  Agencies are also directed to “for each Federal financial assistance \nprogram: (i) assign responsibility and oversight to a senior political appointee to ensure \nFederal financial assistance conforms to Administration priorities; (ii) review currently \npending Federal financial assistance announcements to ensure Administration priorities \nare addressed, and, subject to program statutory authority, modify unpublished Federal \nfinancial assistance announcements, withdraw any announcements already published, \nand, to the extent permissible by law, cancel awards already awarded that are in conflict \nwith Administration priorities, and; (iii) ensure adequate oversight of Federal financial \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 8 of 20\n \n \nassistance programs and initiate investigations when warranted to identify \nunderperforming recipients, and address identified issues up to and including cancellation \nof awards.”  \n24.  The scope of paused funds includes any “implicated by” six executive \norders issued by President Trump since January 20:  \na.  Executive Order, “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs \nand Preferencing” (January 20, 2025), which provides for termination of all \n“equity-related” grants. See https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-\nactions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-\npreferencing/  \nb.  Executive Order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and \nRestoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” (January 20, 2025), \nwhich provides that “[f]ederal funds shall not be used to promote gender \nideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences \nand ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.” See \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-\nfrom-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-\nfederal-government/.  \nc.  Executive Order, “Protecting the American People Against Invasion,” \n(January 20, 2025), which directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to review all “contracts, grants, or other agreements \nproviding Federal funding to non-governmental organizations supporting or \nproviding services” to immigrants without legal status, and to pause \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 9 of 20\n \n \ndisbursement of funds pending the results of the review. See \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-\namerican-people-against-invasion/.  \nd.  Executive Order “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” \n(January 20, 2025), which pauses all disbursements of development assistance \nfunds to foreign countries and implementing organizations for 90 days. See \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-\nrealigning-united-states-foreign-aid/.  \ne.  Executive Order “Unleashing American Energy” directs all agencies to pause \nthe disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of \n2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \n(Public Law 117-58). See https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-\nactions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/. Further guidance issued by \nOMB clarified this only applied to funds related to energy policy. See \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/omb-memo-m-25-\n11/ \nf.  Executive Order “Enforcing the Hyde Amendment” states that “it is the policy \nof the United States, consistent with the Hyde Amendment, to end the forced \nuse of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion” and \nrevokes two previous executive orders. See \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/enforcing-the-hyde-\namendment/. This order directs the Director of OMB promulgate guidance \nimplementing the order. Id.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 10 of 20\n \n \n25.  The Memo’s stated justification for the cessation of funding is that \n“[f]inancial assistance should be dedicated to advancing Administration priorities,” and \nthat “[t]he use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green \nnew deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve \nthe day-to-day lives of those we serve.”  \nMemo M-25-13 Is Final Agency Action Subject to the Court’s Review \n26.  The Administrative Procedure Act authorizes judicial review of final \nagency action. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n27.  Final agency actions are those (1) that “mark the ‘consummation’ of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154, 178 (1997) (quotation marks omitted). \n28.  The Memo marks the consummation of OMB’s decisionmaking process \nbecause it announces the agency’s decision to immediately suspend the obligation or \ndisbursement of all federal financial assistance. \n29.  The Memo is an action by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined or from which legal consequences will flow because it purports to stop \nlawfully authorized obligations and disbursements that would be paid pursuant to valid \nfederal grants. \n30.  Memo M-25-13 therefore is final agency action subject to this Court’s \nreview under the APA. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 11 of 20\n \n \nPlaintiffs’ Injuries \n \n31.  Plaintiff NCN is committed to pursuing a more civil and just society, \nembedding diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout its organization and in the ways \nthat it carries out its mission. One of the ways it works towards that mission is by \nproviding nonprofit organizations with the resources needed to operate more effectively, \nefficiently, and ethically, including by advising nonprofits on available grant programs \nand advocating for increases in federal funding of such programs. For example, NCN has \nsuccessfully advocated for a mandate requiring governments to cover the indirect costs \nfor nonprofits delivering community services with federal funding, and for $50 billion in \nforgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans for nonprofits’ COVID-19 relief, resulting \nin more than 200,000 nonprofits receiving funding and the protection of an estimated 6.2 \nmillion jobs in the sector.   \n32.  Many of NCN’s members rely on federal grants and financial assistance to \nserve their missions, from supporting research and services to those with cancer and other \nserious diseases, to assisting people in escaping domestic violence, to providing mental \nhealth care and suicide hotlines. Federal grants and financial assistance are the lifeblood \nof operations and programs for many of these nonprofits, and even a short pause in \nfunding—which, for many NCN members, is already in the pipeline—could deprive \npeople and communities of their life-saving services. Nonprofits often make budget \ndecisions two to five years in advance, and they make business decisions based on \nexpected cash inflow just as any for-profit enterprise would: making staffing decisions, \nsetting organizational priorities, providing essential services and programs, and \nidentifying and working towards fundraising goals. They rely on federal funds to fund \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 12 of 20\n \n \nentire programs, including salaries. Halting this funding would lead to pauses of \nimportant community programs, food and safety assistance, and lifesaving research, \namong other things: even a short pause could be devastating, decimating organizations, \ncosting lives, and leaving neighbors without the services they need. \n33.  Plaintiff APHA has long received federal grants and funds to carry out its \nmission and to ensure that the federal government has the benefit of APHA’s and its \nmembers’ expertise and research. APHA also often receives federal funds to regrant \nfunds to provide technical and other assistance to essential community-based programs. \nFor example, one of APHA’s programs established The National Council for \nEnvironmental Health and Equity, which provides community-based organizations \nworking to advance environmental justice with grants, and is supported by the CDC. \nAPHA’s members also rely on a range of federal grants and financial assistance: for \nexample, the Prevention and Public Health Fund is a federal program that provides \nsustained investments in prevention and public health programs to improve health and \nreduce public and private health care costs. \n34.  Should the Memo take effect, it would take a wrecking ball to APHA’s \npublic health programs that receive federal financial assistance and grants, as well as to \nthe thousands of programs across the nation on which APHA’s members rely. \n35.  The Memo also harms APHA by seeking to force it to abandon, as a \ncondition of federal funding, its viewpoints and beliefs that working to achieve equity in \nhealth status is essential not only to APHA’s own mission but to the discipline of public \nhealth itself. The Memo therefore chills APHA’s research, work, expression, and speech. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 13 of 20\n \n \n36.  Plaintiff MSA helps small business owners realize their full potential as \nleaders for a just future that prioritizes good jobs, equity, and community through \norganizing, research, and policy advocacy on behalf of small businesses. The Memo’s \nlanguage about equity, however, makes clear that continued receipt of federal financial \nassistance will hinge on what position small businesses take on politically charged issues \nsuch as gender and environmental policy—chilling that speech and curtailing MSA’s \nmission. \n37.  MSA’s small business members compete for and receive various forms of \nfederal financial assistance, including funding in the form of grants, loans, and loan \nguarantees. In fact, the majority of MSA’s members receive some form of this assistance.   \n38.  The Memo’s halt to the funding on which MSA’s members rely will harm \nthem significantly. As one example, MSA has members that operate child care centers in \nreliance on the Child Care & Development Block Grant program administered by the \nOffice of Child Care within the Department of Health and Human Services, which is the \nprimary federal funding source to help families with low incomes access child care. \nHalting payments under that program will significantly harm not only those MSA \nmembers, but also customers who will no longer be able to afford to pay for child care \nabsent the grant program. \n39.  For another example, some MSA members rely on loans administered by \nthe Small Business Administration under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, which \nprovides SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses that lack adequate access to capital \non reasonable terms and conditions. The continued availability of these funds, and the \ndisbursement of loan proceeds already committed, is vital for the continued financial \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 14 of 20\n \n \nwell-being of the recipients. Halting this funding would throw small businesses into \nchaos, with a direct harm to their bottom lines, and, in some cases, resulting in the closure \nof the business. \n40.  Plaintiff SAGE operates through a variety of programs, including, for \nexample, the National Resource Center on LGBTQ+ Aging, which has as its goal to \nprovide ongoing and sustainable resource development, technical assistance, education, \nand training that supports networks in providing services to LGBTQ+ older adults and \ntheir caregivers. The National Resource Center on LGBTQ+ Aging was established in \n2010 through a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services Administration \nfor Community Living (“ACL”), which provided approximately 74% of the project’s \nfunding.   \n41.  SAGE also receives additional grant funds from ACL to build a new \nonline hub, SAGEYou, which is funded exclusively through this federal appropriation.  \nSAGEYou will centralize LGBTQ+-friendly and elder-accessible content addressing \ndisparities such as social isolation, mental health challenges, physical health disparities, \nand financial insecurity, to improve aging outcomes for LGBTQ+ older adults.  \nSAGEYou is scheduled for a soft launch in May 2025 and a hard launch in June 2025. If \nthis funding is lost, the project will no longer exist. This have a detrimental impact on the \nmental health and overall well-being of millions of LGBTQ+ older adults across the \nUnited States (particularly those residing in rural and underserved areas who already face \nsignificant barriers to accessing critical services and supports). Further, the cutoff of \nfunding for SAGEYou jeopardizes multiple staff positions and SAGE’s ability to \ncontinue meeting its obligations to contractors which it has already retained.    \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 15 of 20\n \n \n42.  SAGE reasonably fears that its future receipt of federal financial \nassistance will depend on SAGE’s past and future exercise of its First Amendment rights \nof free speech and association rather than on neutral criteria. \nClaims for Relief  \nCount One  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—706(2)(A) \nArbitrary and capricious  \n \n43.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nhere.  \n44.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n… found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n45.  The OMB Order is arbitrary and capricious in multiple respects. \n46.  First, the Order fails even to acknowledge the catastrophic practical \nconsequences that an immediate, across-the-board freeze on federal grant programs will \nproduce, let alone to provide a reasonable explanation why those consequences could \npossibly be warranted merely to conduct a review of which ones “may be implicated by \nany of the President’s executive orders.” To say that the OPM Order “entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem,” see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983), where it did not even \nrecognize the obvious and immediate nationwide harm and disruption it will occasion is \nto dramatically understate the extent to which the Order is arbitrary and capricious. \n47.  Second, and relatedly, the Order fails to account for the substantial \nreliance interests in the ordinary processes of federal grantmaking that the Order wipes \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 16 of 20\n \n \naway in an effort to freeze all financial assistance. “When an agency changes course … it \nmust be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance \ninterests that must be taken into account,’’ and the failure to do so is arbitrary and \ncapricious. DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). \n48.  Third, the Order fails to articulate why the review of existing grant \nprograms that it envisions requires an immediate cessation of all grant programs, \nnotwithstanding the immense disruption that will cause, and why that review could not \nsimply be conducted while existing obligations and disbursements continue as normal.  \nCount Two \nAdministrative Procedure Act–706(2)(B) \nContrary to the First Amendment \n \n49.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nhere.  \n50.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n… found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  \n51.  The Memo purports to pause all disbursements through federal financial \nassistance programs pending a “review” to determine whether they are “consistent with \nthe President’s policies” as expressed in several executive orders, such as one announcing \nthat “[f]ederal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.” The Memo further \nindicates that the review should identify recipients of federal funding that “advance \nMarxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.” \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 17 of 20\n \n \n52.  Memo M-25-13 makes clear that recipients of federal funding who are \ndetermined to have expressed or advocated for—or perhaps even merely associated \nthemselves with—political, personal, and moral viewpoints disfavored by the \nadministration will not receive further funding through federal financial assistance \nprograms. For them, the “pause” is anything but.  \n53.  Because Memo M-25-13 conditions the continued receipt of billions of \ndollars or more in federal funding on recipient’s exercise of their First Amendment rights \nof free expression and association, it is regulated by the First Amendment.  \n54.  Because Memo M-25-13’s conditions burden core political speech and \nassociation rights, and expressly discriminates based on viewpoint, it is subject to strict \nscrutiny. \n55.  Because Memo M-25-13 is not “the least restrictive means of achieving a \ncompelling state interest,” see Americans for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, \n607 (2021) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), it flunks strict scrutiny.  \nCount Three \nAdministrative Procedure Act–706(2)(C) \nIn Excess of Statutory Authority \n \n56.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nhere.  \n57.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n… found to be … in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n58.  Pursuant to statute, OMB’s is directed to provide “overall direction and \nleadership,” “review agency budget requests for financial management systems and \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 18 of 20\n \n \noperations,” “oversee, periodically review, and make recommendations to heads of \nagencies,” “provide advice to agency heads,” “settle differences that arise among \nagencies regarding the implementation of financial management policies,” and \n“communicate with” State and local governments and “foster the exchange … of \ninformation concerning financial management standards, techniques, and processes.” 31 \nU.S.C. § 503(a). \n59.  OMB instead directs federal agencies to implement its guidance.  See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.106.   \n60.  OMB’s direct statutory authority does not allow it to unilaterally terminate \nall federal financial assistance programs across the entire government.  \n61.  OMB’s action was therefore in excess of its statutory authority and \nunlawful.  \nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray that this Court: \na.  Declare unlawful and set aside Memo M-25-13 as arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity \nunder 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(B), and in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right under 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C); \nb.  Issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the \nOMB and all of its officers, employees, and agents from taking any steps to \nimplement, apply, or enforce Memo M-25-13; \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00239-LLA     Document 1     Filed 01/28/25     Page 19 of 20\n \n \nc.  Order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 24 hours of \nentry of a temporary restraining order, and at regular intervals thereafter, \nconfirming the regular disbursement and obligation of federal financial \nassistance funds and reporting all steps that OMB and its officers, employees, \nand agents have taken to comply with the Court’s temporary restraining order; \nd.  Issue a permanent injunction barring the OMB and all of its officers, \nemployees, and agents from taking any steps to implement, apply, or enforce \nthe Memo; \ne.   Award Plaintiffs their costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, and other \ndisbursements as appropriate; and \nf.
