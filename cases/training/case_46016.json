The parties are reminded that protective agreements intended to limit access to and use of discovery materials do not require prior judicial approval, pursuant to Local Rule 26.08 (D.S.C.). To the extent the parties are nevertheless seeking an order from the Court, the Court has adopted a form Confidentiality Order for use in this District, which can be found on the District Courts website. Pursuant to the instructions included with the form Confidentiality Order, the Court requires use of the form Confidentiality Order as a base form but will consider requested modifications of the language within the form Order. To the extent the parties are seeking something altogether different from the form Order, they are instructed to submit a motion to the Court with sufficient explanation as to why the form Confidentiality Order is not sufficient to address the matter.

    "summary": "<p>This is a lawsuit concerning the allegedly unconstitutional manner in which female inmates were searched at the Beaufort County Detention Center (&ldquo;BCDC&rdquo;) in Beaufort, South Carolina. Specifically, the lawsuit alleged that between February, 2015 through May, 2020, BCDC had a policy of strip searching all female pre-classification detainees upon entry into the facility, but not similarly-situated male detainees. It was brought by two individual female pre-classification detainees at BCDC who were allegedly subjected to strip searches, on behalf of a putative class of themselves and other similarly situated women who were also subjected to this policy. They sued under 42 USC &sect; 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment's right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs also brought constitutional and tort claims under state law.</p>\r\n<p>The original complaint was filed on March 6, 2020, in the Beaufort County Court of Common Pleas. The case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina on June 5, 2020. (An amended complaint was filed August 5, 2020). The lawsuit&rsquo;s defendants included BCDC, and named and unnamed BCDC officials. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. The case sought damages and attorney&rsquo;s fees. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Molly H. Cherry for all pretrial proceedings, and Judge David C. Norton presided.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that in 2015, BCDC changed their policy and required all inmates who were moved from pre-classification to other areas of the jail, including the general population, to be strip searched. BCDC housed female pre-classification detainees in the jail&rsquo;s general population but male pre-classification detainees were placed in separate cells outside the general population. This resulted in all female detainees awaiting bond being subject to a strip and visual body cavity search but not similarly situated male detainees.</p>\r\n<p>On December 1, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class for their equal protection claim. The class consisted of all female pre-classification detainees in BCDC custody who were subject to a strip search when similarly situated males were not. On May 2, 2022, Magistrate Judge Cherry issued a Report and Recommendation (&ldquo;R&amp;R&rdquo;) that the motion to certify class be granted, and the R&amp;R was adopted by Judge Norton on July 14, 2022. 2022 WL 2751626.</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2022, BCDC filed a motion for summary judgment. On October 28, 2022, Magistrate Judge Cherry issued a R&amp;R which recommended granting the motion in part. Magistrate Judge Cherry recommended that only two types of claims should survive: the 14th Amendment equal protection claims against the county, and the tort claims against the county for outrageous/reckless infliction of emotional distress. The magistrate judge reasoned that the Fourth Amendment claims should be dismissed because the plaintiffs were not challenging the searches themselves, only the allegedly discriminatory way in which they were conducted. 2022 WL 19404621. This R&amp;R was partially adopted on March 27, 2023. 2023 WL 2643792. Judge Norton agreed with most of the R&amp;R but dismissed the tort claim as well, leaving only the equal protection claim. The defendants moved for reconsideration, but the court denied the motion on August 1, 2023. 2023 WL 4905971.</p>\r\n<p>โOn June 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability for the remaining causes of action. Judge Norton denied the motion on August 21, 2024, finding there were genuine issues of material fact for each of the plaintiffs'&nbsp;theories of liability.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of February 18, 2025. &nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 1 of 26\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA \nBEAUFORT DIVISION \n \n \nCheryl A. Munday and Margaret Devine,     C/A No.:  9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC \non behalf of themselves and others   \nsimilarly situated,    \n   \n                    Plaintiffs,    \n  AMENDED CLASS ACTION \n-vs-  COMPLAINT 1 \n   \nBeaufort County, Philip Foot, Quandara  (JURY TRIAL DEMANDED) \nGrant, John Does 1-5 and Jane Does 1-5,    \n        \n                    Defendants. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This action concerns the manner in which inmates are searched at the Beaufort \nCounty Detention Center in Beaufort, South Carolina, and alleges, among other things, \nviolations  of  the  Fourth,  Eighth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States \nConstitution and their corollaries under the South Carolina Constitution. \n2.  The main issue raised by this action is the equal protection rights of women \nwhom the Beaufort County Detention Center routinely subject to humiliating strip and \nbody cavity searches in violation of the Constitutions and laws of the United States and \nState of South Carolina. \n3.  A specific concern is that female inmates at the Beaufort County Detention \nCenter are subjected to degrading and unnecessary strip and body cavity searches under \ncircumstances and conditions when male inmates are not. \n \n1 Plaintiffs amend their Complaint with Defendantsโ consent. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 2 of 26\n4.  The named Plaintiffs, Cheryl A. Munday (โMundayโ) and Margaret Devine \n(โDevineโ) seek to represent a class of all women who have been admitted to the Beaufort \nCounty Detention Center while waiting for bail to be set or for an initial court appearance, \nwomen who have been arrested on default warrants and held in the Beaufort County \nDetention Center, and women who have been held in protective custody in the Beaufort \nCounty Detention Center. Included in this proposed class are women who have been \ntaken into custody by Beaufort County Sheriffโs Office and other local law enforcement \nagencies in Beaufort County, South Carolina, and then transported to the Beaufort County \nDetention Center.  These women have all been unlawfully  subjected to routine strip \nsearches, including degrading visual body cavity searches of their anuses and vaginas. \n5.  Plaintiffsโ claims arise out of acts of the Beaufort County Detention Center in \nthe County of Beaufort, State of South Carolina. Venue is therefore proper in Beaufort \nCounty. \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiffs are female residents of Beaufort County, South Carolina. \n7.  Defendant Beaufort County (โCountyโ) is a political subdivision of the State of \nSouth Carolina and owns and operates the Beaufort County Detention Center (โBCDCโ). \nCounty  is  responsible  for  BCDC  policies,  practices,  and/or  customs  which  caused \nPlaintiffsโ injuries in violation of one or more federal constitutional guarantees. \n8.  Defendant Philip Foot (โFootโ) is a citizen and resident of Beaufort County, \nSouth Carolina, and is Assistant County Administrator for Public Safety Division who \noversees BCDC. Foot is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 3 of 26\n9.  Defendant Quandara Grant (โGrantโ) is a citizen and resident of Beaufort \nCounty, South Carolina, and is the director of BCDC. Grant is sued in her individual and \nofficial capacities. \n10.  Defendants  John  Does  1-5  (collectively,  โBCDC  Supervisory  Defendantsโ) \nwere and are now responsible for the training, supervision, control, assignment, and \ndiscipline of both sworn and civilian personnel of the County who work in, operate, \nadminister,  and  manage  BCDC,  and  for  the  formulation,  promulgation,  adoption, \napplication,  administration,  and  enforcement  of  the  policies,  rules,  regulations,  and \npractices of BCDC. At this time, Plaintiffs do not know the identities and capacities of the \nBCDC Supervisory Defendants and therefore sue these Defendants by fictitious names. \nPlaintiffs  will  seek  to  amend  this  Complaint  to  include  one  of  more  of  the  BCDC \nSupervisory Defendantsโ true names and capacities when ascertained. \n11.  Defendants Jane Does 1-5 (collectively, โBCDC Officer Defendantsโ) were at \nall times relevant herein employees of the County who worked as correctional officers at \nBCDC. At this time, Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the BCDC Officer Defendants \nand therefore sue these Defendants by fictitious names. Plaintiffs will seek to amend this \nComplaint to include one of more of the BCDC Officer Defendantsโ true names when \nascertained. \n12.  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant herein, the BCDC Supervisory \nDefendants and the BCDC Officer Defendants participated in, approved, and/or ratified \nthe unconstitutional or illegal acts that occurred within BCDC which are complained of \nherein. \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 4 of 26\n13.  At  all  times  relevant  herein,  the  individual  Defendants  were  the  agents, \nservants, and employees of the County and either were acting within the scope of their \nagency and employment with the knowledge and consent of the County or, alternatively, \nwere acting in their individual capacities. Plaintiffs plead this in the alternative because, \nuntil further discovery is conducted on this topic (including issues of applicable policies \nand procedures, notice and knowledge, and ratification), they cannot allege these facts \nwith certainty. \n14.  At all times herein, Defendants were acting under the color of state law. \nCLAIMS OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \nCheryl Munday \n15.  Munday was arrested by the Bluffton Police Department on or about March 9, \n2018, and accused of driving under the influence, a charge that was later dismissed. Her \narresting officer delivered her to the BCDC and into the custody of one or more BCDC \nOfficer Defendants to begin the booking process. \n16.  At the onset of the booking process, one of the BCDC Officer Defendants \nreviewed  Mundayโs  personal  information  and  commented,  โyou  look  great.โ  The \ncomment, made to the dismay of a nearby supervising officer who was also a BCDC \nOfficer Defendant, was about Mundayโs physical appearance considering her age. The \nofficerโs inappropriate comment was announced just prior to Plaintiff being informed that \nshe was subject to a full body โpat down.โ \n17.  A BCDC Officer Defendant then initiated a full body pat down procedure while \nMundayโs clothing remained on. The officer placed her hands on Mundayโs ankles and \nworked her way up the legs. The officer grabbed Mundayโs crotch with great force, and \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 5 of 26\nslowly  ran  a  finger  along  Mundayโs  vaginal  area.  The  officer  inserted  a  finger  into \nMundayโs vagina as far as it would go until clothing prevented it from going further. The \npat down continued to Mundayโs upper body where the officer attempted to insert her \nhands under Mundayโs bra. \n18.  The BCDC Officer Defendantโs intentional contact with Mundayโs genitalia \nserved no penological purpose and was undertaken with the intent to gratify the officerโs \nsexual desire and/or to humiliate Munday. No reasonable corrections officer, looking at \nthe entire legal landscape at the time of the alleged sexual misconduct, could have \ninterpreted the law as permitting defendantโs actions.  Next, Munday was taken to a small \narea known as the โstrip-search roomโ and required to remove her clothing. While nude, \nMunday was required to bend over, manually spread her buttocks and ordered to cough. \nMunday complied but was asked to repeat the humiliating procedure several times. For \nsome unknown reason, the BCDC Officer Defendant requiring her to do so became angry \nand  started  shouting.  Throughout  the  duration  of  the  humiliating  search,  the  door \nremained open so that any passersby could peer in and see Mundayโs naked body while \nbending over. \n19.  Munday was led back to the main lobby where she witnessed a male arrestee \nbeing booked in. The male arrestee was patted from the knees down only. The officer did \nnot search the manโs groin or buttocks. The man was not strip-searched like females \nwere. He was handed jail clothing and directed to change in an adjacent room. \nMargaret Devine \n20.  Devine was arrested by the South Carolina Highway Patrol on or about January \n17, 2019, and accused of driving under the influence, a charge that was later dismissed. \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 6 of 26\nShe was transported to BCDC and into the custody of one or more BCDC Officer \nDefendants to begin the booking process. \n21.  Devineโs personal belongings were confiscated including her purse, wallet, \njewelry, cell phone and cash. A BCDC officer then initiated a full body pat down while \nDevineโs clothing remained on. \n22.  Devine was led to a shower stall and required to remove her clothing. The \nshower stall was open so that passers-by were able to see in. Once Devine was nude, \ntwo BCDC guards instructed her to turn around, face a wall and bend over from the waist \nso that her backside and genitalia were fully exposed. Devine was ordered to cough. \n23.  Devine was humiliated but complied. Despite her compliance, the officers \nordered her to โcough harder and louder.โ She again complied. Then, she was ordered to \ntake a shower while the guards watched. \n24.  The BCDC guards were again dissatisfied and required Devine to shower \nagain,  this  time  making  sure  to  wet  her  hair  completely.  Devine  was  humiliated, \ndemeaned and demoralized. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Common Factual Allegations \n25.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip-searched and \nforced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when \nbooked into BCDC. \n26.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip-searched and \nforced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when they \nare first placed in general population. \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 7 of 26\n27.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip-searched \nand forced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when \nthey are booked into BCDC. \n28.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip-searched \nand forced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when \nthey are first placed in general population. \n29.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege the strip and/or visual body cavity \nsearches to which Plaintiffs and class members were subjected were performed pursuant \nto Defendantsโ policy and practice to indiscriminately search all or a large number of \nwomen but not men being processed into the jail without regard to: (a) The nature of their \noffense or criminal history; (b) Whether they are under an order of release; (c) Whether \nthey have had contact with any persons from outside BCDC who could reasonably be \nbelieved to be a potential source of contraband or weapons; (d) Whether there is a reason \nof any kind to believe they are a potential source of contraband or weapons; (e) Whether \nthere is any other articulable justification for Defendantsโ indiscriminate strip and body \nsearch policy; and (f) Whether there is any legitimate reason to strip-search women but \nnot men, as set forth herein. \n30.  The policy of BCDC under which female arrestees were rountinely subjected \nto strip searches while similar situated males were not established a significant disparity \nin treatment based on gender.  \n31.  Upon information and belief, there is little, or no, comparative data to suggest \nthat women arrested in Beaufort County, South Carolina, conceal items in their vaginas \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 8 of 26\nto such a degree as to justify strip searching only women and not mean arrested for similar \noffenses.   \n32.  On information and belief, Defendants have a policy of not limiting to those who \nare necessary for the procedure the persons who can see, hear, or observe all or part of \nthe strip and body cavity searches. Thus, other officers or jail employees, members of the \nopposite sex, dispensable jail personnel, and possibly others are able to see, hear, or \nobserve some or all of the searches described above. Specifically, class members are \nrequired to submit to strip-searches during which other people who are not participating \nin the same and/or are of the opposite sex, including jail staff, are able to observe the \nsearch and the class membersโ naked bodies. \n33.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalves, and on behalf of a class of all \nother persons similarly situated in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. The class is defined \nas those women who were forced to undergo the unlawful strip and/or visual body cavity \nsearches at BCDC which are operated, maintained, and under the control of Beaufort \nCounty as set forth in this Complaint; to wit, searches that violated the Fourth Amendment \nor its South Carolina equivalent or searches that violated the equal protection of the law \ndue to the fact that the policy and custom of strip-searches was applied to women, but \nnot to men. \nB.  Rule 23 Prerequisites \ni.  Numerosity \n34.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), the members of the class are so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know the exact \nnumber of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon alleges, that \n8 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 9 of 26\nthere are hundreds, perhaps thousands, who were subjected to strip and/or body cavity \nsearches as a result of Defendantsโ policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting \nprisoners to strip and body cavity searches. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \nthereon allege, that the numbers of persons in the proposed class is in the hundreds or \nthousands. \nii.  Common Issues of Fact or Law \n35.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), there are questions of fact common \nto the class.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the commons \nquestions of fact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether BCDC routinely \nsubjects  all  prisoners  to  strip  and/or  body  cavity  searches  without  any  reasonable \nsuspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular inmate has \nconcealed drugs, weapons, and/or any contraband on her person or in her body cavities; \n(2) Whether the strip and/or body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so \nthat the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search or whether \nthe strip and body cavity searches are conducted in areas where they may be observed \nby persons not participating in the searches; (3) Whether females are subjected to strip \nand/or body cavity searches when males are not; and (4) Whether females are subjected \nto strip and/or body cavity searches under conditions which are more intrusive than males. \n36.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), there are questions of law common to \nthe class.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and, thereon allege, that the commons \nquestions of law include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Whether BCDC may \nindiscriminately conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates without there being \nany reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular \n9 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 10 of 26\ninmate has concealed  drugs,  weapons,  and/or  any  contraband  on  her  person  or  in \nher body cavities; (2) Whether BCDC may conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of \ninmates in open areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the \nsearches; (3) Whether BCDCโs policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or body cavity \nsearches violates Title 24 of the South Carolina Code of Laws including, without limitation, \nS.C. CODE ANN. ยง 24-5-90; (4) Whether BCDCโs policy of subjecting persons to strip \nand/or body cavity searches in an area which is not an โarea of privacyโ violates Title 24 of \nthe South Carolina Code of Laws including, without limitation, S.C. CODE ANN. ยง 24-5-90; \n(5)  Whether  the  conduct  described  above  violates  the  Fourth  and/or  Fourteenth \nAmendments and/or Article I of the South Carolina Constitution; (6) Whether the conduct \ndescribed above constitutes a policy or custom of Defendants; and (7) Whether any \nindividual Defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claims, or state law \nimmunity on the state law claims, for the practices complained of herein. \niii. Typicality \n37.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), the claims of the representative \nPlaintiffs are typical of the class. Class Plaintiffs were in BCDC custody when they were \nsubjected  to  strip  and/or  body  cavity  searches  of  inmates  without  any  reasonable \nsuspicion based on specific or articulable facts to believe that they had concealed drugs, \nweapons, and/or contraband in their body cavities; Class Plaintiffs were subjected to the \nsearches in open areas where others could observe who were not involved in the search, \nincluding members of the opposite sex; Class Plaintiffs were forced to stand naked in \nunsanitary areas; and females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under \nconditions which were more intrusive and less sanitary than males. \n10 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 11 of 26\n38.  Thus, Plaintiffs Munday and Devine have the same interests and has suffered \nthe same type of damages as the class members. Plaintiffsโ claims are based upon the \nsame or similar legal theories as the claims of the class members. Each class member \nsuffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity \nsearch.  The  actual damages  suffered by Plaintiffs are  similar  in  type  to the actual \ndamages suffered by each class member. \n39.  In  accordance  with  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a),  Munday  and  Devine,  as  the \nrepresentative Plaintiffs, will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Their \ninterests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \niv. Maintenance and Superiority \n40.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of separate actions \nby individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying \nadjudications  with  respect  to  individual  members  of  the  class  would  establish \nincompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n41.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate actions \nby individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications with respect to \nindividual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair \nor impeded the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests. \n42.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs are informed and believe, \nand thereon allege, that Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass. \n43.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact common \nto the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual \n11 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 12 of 26\nmembers and this class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are informed and \nbelieve, and thereon allege, that the interests of class members in individually controlling \nthe prosecution of a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable \nto individually prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon \nallege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are such that separate suits would be \nimpracticable in that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \nrepresent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that it is desirable \nto concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same \nlocation. It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact \nin one forum rather than in multiple courts. \n44.  Plaintiffs  do  not  know  the  identities  of  the  class  members.  Plaintiffs  are \ninformed and believe, and thereon allege, that the identities of the class members are \nascertainable from BCDC records, in particular the computer system used to track and \nidentify BCDC inmates. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that \nDefendants possess the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the \npersons who have been held in custody at BCDC; when inmates were arrested and \nbooked, taken to court, and returned from court; why inmates were released; and when \ninmates were released. \n45.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of \nthis litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. The class action is \nsuperior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class. \nThe class action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist \n12 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 08/05/20    Entry Number 12     Page 13 of 26\nfrom which to ascertain the members of the class. Liability can be determined on a class-\nwide basis. \n46.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), class members must be furnished \nwith the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all \nmembers who can be identified through reasonable efforts. Plaintiffs are informed and \nbelieve that BCDC computer records contain a last known address for class members. \nPlaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last \nknown address by first class mail. Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class \nmembers of the following: \nA.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \nB.  The nature of the action; \nC. Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which event they \nwill not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \nD. Their right, if they do not โopt outโ, to be represented by their own counsel \nand enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by \nthe named Plaintiffs and their counsel; and, \nE.  Their right, if they do not โopt outโ, to share in any recovery in favor of the \nclass, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues, \nadverse to the class. \nCOUNT ONE - 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [FOURTH AMENDMENT] - ALL DEFENDANTS \n47.

Cherryโs report and \nrecommendation (โR&Rโ), ECF No. 76, that the court grant in part and deny in part \ndefendant Beaufort Countyโs (โBeaufort Countyโ or the โCountyโ) motion for summary \njudgment, ECF No. 48.  For the reasons set forth below, the court adopts the R&R in part \nand rejects the R&R in part and grants the motion in part and denies the motion in part.  \nI.   BACKGROUND \nThe R&R ably recites the facts of the case, and the parties do not object to the \nR&Rโs recitation thereof.  Therefore, the court will only briefly summarize material facts \nas they appear in the R&R for the purpose of aiding an understanding of the courtโs legal \nanalysis. \n1 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 2 of 23\nThis matter arises from certain procedures in place at the Beaufort County \nDetention Center1 (โBCDCโ) that are used for female pre-classification detainees.2  Once \na pre-trial detainee goes to a bond hearing and cannot post a bond, upon returning to \nBCDC, he or she is then classified to a different area at BCDC, such as in general \npopulation or, depending on the inmateโs behavior, maximum or super maximum \nsecurity.  ECF No. 34-3 at 21:3โ18.  On February 27, 2015, BCDC adopted a policy (the \nโpolicyโ) that all inmates moved from pre-classification to other areas of BCDC, \nincluding general population, would be strip searched.  See ECF No. 31-4 at 2.  However, \nBCDCโs practice (the โpracticeโ) has been to house female pre-classification inmates in \ngeneral population while placing male pre-classification inmates in a separate pre-\nclassification cell outside of general population.  ECF No. 31-3 at 14, Black Dep. 24:2โ\n20.  Because female pre-classification inmates are housed in general population from the \noutset, the practice resulted in BCDC conducting a strip search on every female pre-\nclassification detainee awaiting a bond hearing.  ECF No. 40-1 ยถ 6.  BCDC, however, did \nnot do so for similarly situated male pre-classification detainees prior to May 5, 2020, \nbecause they were housed in a separate pre-classification cell outside of general \npopulation.   \nThe two named plaintiffs in this case, Cheryl Munday (โMundayโ) and Margaret \nDevine (โDevineโ) (collectively, โplaintiffsโ) allege they were impacted by this practice.  \nSpecifically, each of them describes being arrested for driving under the influence (each \n \n1 Defendant Beaufort County operates BCDC. ECF Nos. 12 ยถ 7, 13 ยถ 5.   \n2 A pre-classification detainee is an inmate who has been arrested and placed or \nhoused in an area at the detention center prior to going to a bond hearing.  ECF No. 34-1 \nat 20:7โ14.   \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 3 of 23\nhad that charge later dismissed), brought into BCDC for holding, and subjected to a \npublic strip search and visual body cavity searchโall while similarly situated men were \nnot subjected to such a search.   \nPlaintiffs filed the instant case on March 6, 2020, in the Beaufort County Court of \nCommon Pleas on behalf of themselves and a class of all similarly situated women who \nwere subjected to the practice and the policy.3  ECF No. 1-1, Compl.  On June 5, 2020, \nBeaufort County removed the case to federal court.  ECF No. 1.  This case was referred \nto Magistrate Judge Molly Cherry for all pretrial proceedings pursuant to the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g) (D.S.C.).  On \nAugust 5, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, now the operative complaint.  \nECF No. 12, Amend. Compl.  The plaintiffs brought various state and federal claims \nagainst Beaufort County, Assistant County Administrator for the Public Safety Division \nPhilip Foot (โFootโ), Director of the BCDC Colonel Quandara Grant (โDirector Grantโ), \nJohn Does 1โ5 (described as โBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ), and Jane Does 1-5 \n(described as โBCDC Officer Defendantsโ) (collectively, โdefendantsโ).  Amend. Compl. \nยถยถ 7โ11. \nOn May 2, 2022, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  ECF No. 48.  \nOn May 31, 2022, plaintiffs filed a response in opposition, ECF No. 56, to which \ndefendants replied on June 14, 2022, ECF No. 63.  On October 28, 2022, Magistrate \n \n3 Specifically, the class is defined as โall women who have been admitted to the \nBeaufort County Detention Center while waiting for bail to be set or for an initial court \nappearance, women who have been arrested on default warrants and held in the Beaufort \nCounty Detention Center, and women who have been held in protective custody in the \nBeaufort County Detention Center. . . . These women have all been unlawfully subjected \nto routine strip searches, including degrading visual body cavity searches of their anuses \nand vaginas.โ  Compl. ยถ 4.   \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 4 of 23\nJudge Cherry issued the R&R that recommended the motion for summary judgment be \ngranted in part and denied in part and recommended that plaintiffsโ request to amend their \namended complaint to name new defendants be denied.  ECF No. 76, R&R.  On \nNovember 13, 2022, Beaufort County objected to the R&R, ECF No. 79, to which \nplaintiffs responded on November 28, 2022, ECF No. 80, and defendants filed a sur-reply \non December 1, 2022, ECF No. 81.  As such, the motion has been fully briefed and it is \nnow ripe for review.   \nII.   STANDARD \nA.  Order on R&R \nThis court is charged with conducting a de novo review of any portion of the \nmagistrate judgeโs R&R to which specific, written objections are made.  28 U.S.C. \nยง 636(b)(1).  A partyโs failure to object is accepted as agreement with the conclusions of \nthe magistrate judge.  See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 149โ50 (1985).  The \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge carries no presumptive weight, and the \nresponsibility to make a final determination rests with this court.  Mathews v. Weber, 423 \nU.S. 261, 270โ71 (1976).  The court may โaccept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, \nthe findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge . . . or recommit the \nmatter to the magistrate judge with instructions.โ  28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1).  The court is \ncharged with making a de novo determination of any portion of the R&R to which a \nspecific objection is made.  Id.   \nHowever, in the absence of a timely filed, specific objection, the court reviews the \nR&R only for clear error.  Diamond v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, \n315 (4th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).  Furthermore, โ[a] partyโs general objections are \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 5 of 23\nnot sufficient to challenge a magistrate judgeโs findings.โ  Greene v. Quest Diagnostics \nClinical Labs., Inc., 455 F. Supp. 2d 483, 488 (D.S.C. 2006) (citation omitted).  When a \npartyโs objections are directed to strictly legal issues โand no factual issues are \nchallenged, de novo review of the record may be dispensed with.โ  Orpiano v. Johnson, \n687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. 1982) (citation omitted).  Analogously, de novo review is \nunnecessary when a party makes general and conclusory objections without directing a \ncourtโs attention to a specific error in a magistrate judgeโs proposed findings.  Id. \nB.  Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure \nmaterials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(c).  โBy its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some \nalleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly \nsupported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine \nissue of material fact.โ  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247โ48 (1986).  \nโOnly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing \nlaw will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.โ  Id. at 248. โ[S]ummary \njudgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is โgenuine,โ that is, if the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ  \nId.  โ[A]t the summary judgment stage the judgeโs function is not himself to weigh the \nevidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a \ngenuine issue for trial.โ  Id. at 249.  The court should view the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw all inferences in its favor.  Id. at 255.  \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 6 of 23\nIII.   DISCUSSION \nThe R&R recommended that the court grant summary judgment on Count 1 \n(violations of the Fourth Amendment pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 brought against all \ndefendants), Count 2 (violations of the Equal Protection Clause pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983 brought against the individual defendants), Count 3 (violation of the Fourth \nAmendment analogue in the South Carolina Constitution, Art. I ยง 10, brought against all \ndefendants), Count 4 (violation of the Equal Protection Clause analogue in the South \nCarolina Constitution, Art. I ยง 3, brought against all defendants), Count 5 (negligent \ndeprivation of statutory rights under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (โSCTCAโ) \nbrought against Beaufort County), Count 7 (assault brought against all defendants), \nCount 8 (battery brought against BCDC Officer Defendants and Beaufort County), and \nCount 9 (negligence brought against all defendants).  See R&R at 37โ38.  However, the \nR&R recommended that the court deny summary judgment with respect to three counts: \n(1) Count 2 (violations of the Equal Protection Clause pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nbrought against Beaufort County), id. at 11โ19; (2) Count 6 (outrage brought against \nBeaufort County), id. at 26โ28; and (3) Count 10 (attorneysโ fees under 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1988(b)), id. at 38.   \nNeither party objects to the R&Rโs recommendation to grant summary judgment \nas to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9, and in the absence of a timely filed, specific objection, \nthe court reviews the R&R only for clear error.  Diamond, 416 F.3d at 315.  A review of \nthe record for clear error indicates that the R&R accurately summarized this case and the \napplicable law.  Accordingly, the court adopts the magistrate judgeโs R&R as to Counts \n1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, and grants defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on those \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 7 of 23\nclaims.  Additionally, the R&R recommends finding all claims against individual \ndefendantsโincluded as part of Count 2โbarred by qualified immunity.  Neither party \nobjects to this conclusion.  The court finds no clear error and grants summary judgment \non plaintiffsโ claims against individual defendants included in Count 2 and denies \nplaintiffsโ request to amend the complaint to name individual defendants.4  Defendants, \n \n4 The R&R addressed plaintiffsโ claims asserted against defendants Foot and \nDirector Grant under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 based on violations of plaintiffsโ Fourteenth \nAmendment rights and found them to be barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity.  \nR&R at 19โ25.  Neither party contests this recommendation, and the court reviews the \nR&R only for clear error.  Diamond, 416 F.3d at 315.  Given that the court denies \nsummary judgment for Count 2 and 10 as asserted against Beaufort County, it finds it \nrelevant to briefly include the qualified immunity analysis for the equal protection claims \nasserted against the individual defendants under the same claims.   \nThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials performing \ndiscretionary functions โfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not \nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person \nwould have known.โ  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  The two prongs of \nthe qualified immunity test may be applied in any order.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. \n223, 236 (2009).  โQualified immunity shields federal and state officials [individually] \nfrom money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated \na statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was โclearly establishedโ at the \ntime of the challenged conduct.โ  Fauconier v. Clarke, 966 F.3d 265, 280 (4th Cir. 2020) \n(quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011)).  In determining whether the \nright violated was clearly established, the court defines the right โin light of the specific \ncontext of the case, not as a broad general proposition.โ  Parrish v. Cleveland, 372 F.3d \n294, 301 (4th Cir. 2004).   \nThe R&R found that though a constitutional violation could likely be established under \nthe first prong, under the second prong, the right was not clearly established at the time of \nthe violation.  R&R at 21โ24.  Again, the court reiterates the challenged practice at issue: \nhousing female pre-classification detainees in general population and subjecting them to \nstrip-searches when similarly situated male detainees were housed outside of general \npopulation and were not subjected to such searches.  The magistrate judge noted that the \nparties have pointed to no controlling authority from the Supreme Court, the Fourth \nCircuit, or this district sufficiently like the situation individual defendants confronted in \nthis case that would have made it clear to them that their conduct under BCDCโs practice \nviolated plaintiffsโ equal protection rights.  R&R at 24.  As such, the R&R recommended \nthe court find that plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims based in equal protection brought against \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 8 of 23\nobject to the magistrate judgeโs recommendation with regards to Counts 2 (against \nBeaufort County), 6, and 10, ECF No. 79.  In concrete terms, then, the court reviews de \nnovo the magistrate judgeโs conclusions regarding Counts 2, 6, and 10 and the partiesโ \nobjections in turn. \nA.  Count 2: Equal Protection Claims against Beaufort County \nThe R&R recommended that summary judgment be denied for plaintiffsโ claims \nagainst Beaufort County under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Beaufort County objects to this recommendation \nfor two reasons.  First, the County argues that plaintiffs have not created a genuine issue \nof material fact as to discriminatory intent.  ECF No. 79 at 9.  Second, under scrutiny \ndeferential to prison officials,5 defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot create a genuine \nissue of material fact of a constitutional violation.  Id. at 12.  The court summarizes the \nlaw of equal protection for pre-classification detainees before examining the arguments in \nturn.   \nAt issue in this case is Beaufort Countyโs alleged violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment's equal protection clause, which states, in relevant part, that โ[n]o State \nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.โ  U.S. \n \nindividual defendants Director Grant, Foot, and the Doe Defendants are barred by \nqualified immunity, and the court adopts that recommendation.   \n5 It is admittedly confusing whether defendants seek intermediate scrutiny or a \nmore deferential scrutiny proposed by Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. \n2001).  Defendants have been inconsistent in their briefs as to which level of scrutiny \nthey seek.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 48-1 at 13โ15 (applying intermediate scrutiny); 63 at 9โ\n12 (seeking deferential scrutiny under Morrison); 79 (same); 81 (same).  For the sake of \nthis order, the court assumes that defendants are requesting the more deferential standard \nunder Morrison notwithstanding their failure to request that standard in their original \nmotion for summary judgment.  See ECF No. 48-1 at 13โ15.   \n8 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 9 of 23\nConst. amend. XIV, ยง 1.  The clause requires that similarly-situated individuals be treated \nalike.  Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir. 2008) (citing City of Cleburne \nv. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985)).  โTo succeed on an equal \nprotection claim, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that [s]he has been treated differently \nfrom others with whom [s]he is similarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the \nresult of intentional or purposeful discrimination.โ  Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, \n654 (4th Cir. 2001).  โOnce this showing is made, the court proceeds to determine \nwhether the disparity in treatment can be justified under the requisite level of scrutiny.โ  \nId.   \n1.  Different Treatment \nAccording to the Fourth Circuit, unequal treatment constituting an equal \nprotection violation โoccurs in one of two ways: (1) when the government explicitly \nclassifies people based on race, or (2) when a law is facially neutral, but its \nadministration or enforcement disproportionately affects one class of persons over \nanother and a discriminatory intent or animus is shown.โ  Monroe v. City of \nCharlottesville, 579 F.3d 380, 388 (4th Cir. 2009).  Express classifications are those that \nare โexplicitly stated on the face of a statute or in the reasons given for its administration \nor enforcement.โ  Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert Cnty., 48 F.3d 810, 819 (4th Cir. 1995).  \nSuspect facially neutral classifications are simply those that are not explicitly stated but \nare nevertheless applied.  Id. at 818โ19. \nDefendants disagree with the R&Rโs finding that the challenged practice \nconstituted facial discrimination on the basis of genderโwhich meant that discriminatory \nintent was unnecessary to prove.  See R&R at 13โ14.  The challenged action is BCDCโs \n9 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 10 of 23\npractice of housing female pre-classification detainees in general population requiring a \nstrip search on every female pre-classification detainee awaiting bond between February \n27, 2015, and May 5, 2020, but not housing similarly situated male pre-classification \ndetainees in general population thereby allowing them to avoid strip-searches without \nreasonable suspicion during that time.  R&R at 13โ14 (citing ECF No. 40-1); ECF No. 79 \nat 1โ4 (explaining the strip-search policy at the prison).  As the magistrate judge \nhighlights, plaintiffs challenge BCDCโs practice, not its policy applying to all inmates \nโbeing moved from Pre-Class to other areas of the facility.โ  R&R at 13.  The separate \nhousing whereby female pretrial detainees were housed in general population at the \noutset, while male pretrial detainees were not, is not facially neutral but rather an explicit \nclassification based on sex.  Id. at 13 n.9. \nBeaufort County objects to the R&Rโs characterization and reiterates that the strip \nsearches and search policy are facially gender-neutral because they call for searches of all \ndetainees who move into contact with general population inmates.  ECF No. 79 at 10.  \nRather, Beaufort County argues that โ[t]he searching of female inmates is the result of the \nfact that female pre-classification detainees happen to be located in general population, \nwhereas there exists a separate pre-classification holding area for male detainees.โ  Id. at \n10โ11.  Further, Beaufort County emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not arguing that they \nwere housed in inferior housing as compared to male pre-classification detaineesโwhich \nthe County admits is โan explicit classification based on sexโโbut rather plaintiffs are \nchallenging the strip searches which were incidental to that difference in housing.  Id. at \n11.  Plaintiffs disagree with the County and argue that Beaufort Countyโs practice of \nstrip-searching all female pre-classification detainees, but not all similarly situated males, \n10 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 11 of 23\nis not gender neutral but, instead, intentional disparity in treatment from other situated \ninmates based on sex.  ECF No. 80 at 3.   \nThe court finds Beaufort Countyโs objections without merit.  At its core, the \naction challenged is BCDCโs practice of placing male pre-classification detainees in \nhousing separate from general population inmatesโwhich meant they were not \nautomatically subjected to strip searchesโwhereas female pre-classification detainees \nwere placed in general population and were always subjected to strip searches.  R&R at \n13 n.9.  Ignoring the preliminary decision to house only one gender with general \npopulation inmates and to solely focus on the policy of strip-searching prisoners joining \ngeneral population inmates requires the court to bury its head in the sand.  โ[T]he \nSupreme Court outlined . . . a โsimple testโ for identifying facial sex discrimination: such \ndiscrimination appears โwhere the evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner \nwhich but for that personโs sex would be different.โโ  Bauer v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 340, \n347โ48 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting City of L.A. Depโt of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 \nU.S. 702, 711 (1978)).  Had plaintiffs been male, they would have been placed in \nseparate pre-classification detainee housing and would have in all likelihood avoided the \nstrip search.  Consequently, BCDCโs practice clearly falls under the category of facial sex \ndiscrimination.  Finding the practice to purposefully discriminate between similarly \nsituated persons on the basis of gender, the court next examines the appropriate level of \nscrutiny to determine whether there are disputes over material facts such that this claim \nshould survive summary judgment.   \n \n \n11 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 12 of 23\n2.  Scrutiny \nOrdinarily, a state regulation or policy will be presumed to be valid and will be \nsustained if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  See City \nof Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.  When the state classifies by race, alienage, or national \norigin, however, special concerns are implicated and strict scrutiny applies.  See id.; see \nalso United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (โVMIโ) (applying intermediate \nscrutiny for classifications based on gender).  Such factors are โso seldom relevant to the \nachievement of any legitimate state interestโ and, therefore, โare deemed to reflect \nprejudice and antipathyโa view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or \ndeserving as others.โ  Id. \nOutside the prison context, alleged discrimination on the basis of gender is subject \nto an intermediate level of scrutiny.6  See Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 732 (4th Cir. \n \n6 Plaintiffs strongly argue that intermediate scrutiny is the appropriate standard for \nthe instant case notwithstanding the prison context.  ECF No. 80 at 4โ5 (citing ECF No. \n56 at 9โ14 and adopting all those arguments by reference).  Importantly, some courts \nhave determined that gender-based equal protection claims in the prison context receive \nintermediate scrutiny.  See, e.g., Harrison v. Kernan, 971 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir. 2020) \n(holding that prison regulations which facially discriminate on the basis of gender must \nreceive intermediate scrutiny); Roubideaux v. N.D. Depโt of Corr. & Rehab., 570 F.3d \n966, 974โ75 (8th Cir. 2009) (applying intermediate scrutiny in gender-based prison \ncases); Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d 1450, 1454โ55 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); \nWilliamson v. Maciol, 839 F. Appโx 633, 638 (2d Cir. 2021) (same); Dinote v. Danberg, \n601 F. Appโx 127, 130 (3d Cir. 2015) (same); Pariseau v. Wilkinson, 1997 WL 144218, \nat *1 (6th Cir. Mar. 27, 1997); but see Glover v. Johnson, 198 F.3d 557, 561 (6th Cir. \n1999) (declining to decide the appropriate level of scrutiny for equal protection claims in \nthe prison setting because the district court properly found no disparate treatment).  For a \nclassification to survive intermediate scrutiny, the government must show that the \nclassification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory \nmeans employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.  See \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 533.  In a prison context, the penological interests may still factor into \nthe analysis of an equal protection claim because such considerations properly inform \nwhether there exists an important state interest.  Harrison, 971 F.3d at 1079.    \n12 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 13 of 23\n2002).  โWhen equal protection challenges arise in a prison context, however, courts must \nadjust the level of scrutiny to ensure that prison officials are afforded the necessary \ndiscretion to operate their facilities in a safe and secure manner.โ  Morrison, 239 F.3d at \n654โ55.  โ[T]he proper standard for determining the validity of a prison regulation \nclaimed to infringe on an inmateโs constitutional rights is to ask whether the regulation is \nโreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.โโ  Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. \n210, 223 (1990) (quoting Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987)); but see Johnson v. \nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 506โ10 (2005) (holding that a prisonโs facially racially \ndiscriminatory policy must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny and \nlimiting Turnerโs reasonable-relationship test โonly to rights inconsistent with proper \nincarcerationโ); Harrison v. Kernan, 971 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir. 2020) (extending \nJohnsonโs holding of strict scrutiny for racial classifications in a prison context to require \nintermediate scrutiny for gender classifications in a prison context).  The plaintiffs in the \ninstant case were pre-classification detaineesโnot convicted prisonersโand it is \ndebatable whether the same standard of review applies to them requiring deferential \nscrutiny rather than intermediate scrutiny.7  However, the court need not resolve that \n \n7 Beaufort County emphasized that the lesser standard also applies to pretrial \ndetainees who have been accused of crimes, not just prisoners, though the cases cited are \nnot direct authority on the issue of equal protection in prison policy.  See ECF No. 79 at \n13 n.6.  Pre-trial detainees retain, at a minimum, the same rights enjoyed by convicted \nprisoners.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545 (1979).  Moreover, the Supreme Court \nhas found that in some contexts pre-trial detainees retain greater rights than convicted \nprisoners.  See id. at 534โ37 (holding that pre-trial detainees possess a clearly established \nconstitutional right to be free from punishment, whereas convicted prisoners have a right \nto be free from cruel and unusual punishment).  It is unclear whether pre-trial detainees \nare subject to a different standard of review than convicted prisoners in the equal \nprotection context.  Neither the Supreme Court nor the Fourth Circuit has clearly set forth \na lower standard for pre-trial detainees with regards to equal protection claims. The court \ndeclines to establish a new standard now in part because the court finds there is gender-\n13 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 14 of 23\nquestion at this time because it agrees with the magistrate judgeโs analysisโthat Beaufort \nCountyโs gender-based practice failsโeven under a more deferential standard.8   \nโ[W]hile a prisoner does not forfeit his constitutional right to equal protection by \nthe fact he has been convicted of a crime and imprisoned, prisoner claims under the equal \nprotection clause . . . must still be analyzed in light of the special security and \nmanagement concerns in the prison system.โ  Morrison, 239 F.3d at 655.  โTo succeed on \nan equal protection claim, a prisoner must first show that [s]he was treated differently \nfrom others who were similarly situated and that the unequal treatment resulted from \nintentional or purposeful discrimination.โ  Daye v. Rubenstein, 417 F. Appโx 317, 318 \n(4th Cir. 2011).  After the prisoner makes such a showing, the prisoner โmust allege facts \nthat, if โtrue, would demonstrate that disparate treatment lacks justification under the \nrequisite level of scrutiny.โโ  Id. at 318โ19 (quoting Veney, 293 F.3d at 731).  In a prison \ncontext, subject to the discussion above, courts โmust determine whether the disparate \ntreatment is โreasonably related to [any] legitimate penological interests.โโ  Veney, 293 \n \nbased discrimination even under the more deferential standard applied to convicted \nprisoners.   \n8 Were the court to apply intermediate scrutiny the challenged practice would \nclearly fail.  For a classification to survive intermediate scrutiny, the government must \nshow that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the \ndiscriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those \nobjectives.  See VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (1996).  In other words, โ[p]arties who seek to \ndefend gender-based government action must demonstrate an โexceedingly persuasive \njustificationโ for that action.โ  Id. at 531.  Beaufort County argued that space constraints, \nfunding, limited resources, and the risk of contraband required them to house male and \nfemale pre-classification detainees differently, see ECF No. 79 at 19โ20, but thereafter \nhave failed to explain their ability to accommodate their current gender-neutral policy of \nhousing all pre-classification detainees in general population and subjecting everyone to \nstrip searches, see id. at 4.  Under intermediate scrutiny, Beaufort County has to date not \ndemonstrated an exceedingly persuasive justification for its gender-based practice of \nhousing female detainees in general population requiring them to be strip searched.  See \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 531.   \n14 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 15 of 23\nF.3d 726, 732 (4th Cir. 2002) (quoting Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223, 225 (2001)).  \nCourts apply a four-part test to determine whether a prison policy is constitutional: \n(1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the policy and the \npenological interest; (2) whether an alternative means of exercising the right \nremains open to prison inmates; (3) the impact accommodation of the \nasserted right will have on guards, other inmates, and the allocation of \nprison  resources;  and  (4)  the  absence  of  ready  alternatives  that  fully \naccommodate the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological \ninterests. \nMorrison, 239 F.3d at 655 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 89โ91).   \n  The R&R found that even under Morrisonโs less rigorous standard, plaintiffs have \nset forth sufficient evidence to support an equal protection claim against BCDC at this \nstage of the litigation, and the court agrees.  R&R at 15โ19.  The court examines the four \nfactors in turn.   \nThe first Morrison factor does not conclusively establish that the challenged \npractice had a valid, rational connection to a penological interest.  See 239 F.3d at 655.  \nDefendants argue that because female pre-classification detainees, unlike their male \ncounterparts, were housed in the jailโs general population area where weapons and \ncontraband posed a danger, preventing the passage of contraband using strip searches was \na legitimate penological interest.  ECF No. 79 at 14; R&R at 15โ16 (citing ECF No. 63 at \n12).  The court agrees that preventing access to contraband is clearly a legitimate \nconcern.  See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cnty. of Burlington, 566 U.S. \n318, 332โ34 (2012) (โDetecting contraband concealed by new detainees . . . is a most \nserious responsibility.  Weapons, drugs, and alcohol all disrupt the safe operation of a \njail.โ); McRae v. Johnson, 261 F. Appโx 554, 558 (4th Cir. 2008) (โ[I]n the prison setting, \nsuppression of contraband, maintaining discipline and security among the inmate \npopulation, maintaining the health and safety of inmates and staff, and preventing \n15 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 16 of 23\nprisoners from quickly changing their appearance constitute compelling governmental \ninterests.โ).  However, the action challenged is not the search itself but rather its unequal \napplication to male versus female pre-classification detainees, for which the court finds \nthe defendants have not established a valid, rational connection.9  \nThe court evaluates the second through fourth Morrison factors together and finds \nthat ready alternatives could have accommodated the pre-classification detaineesโ rights \nat de minimis costs to valid penological interests.  See 239 F.3d at 655.  Preliminarily, \nfemale pre-classification detainees had no alternatives but to consent to the strip search.  \nIn contrast, Beaufort County had other options besides a gender-based housing practice.  \nAlternatives are directly relevant since โthe existence of obvious, easy alternatives may \nbe evidence that the regulation is not reasonable, but is an โexaggerated responseโ to \nprison concerns.โ  Turner, 482 U.S. at 90.  The R&R identified two easy alternatives: (1) \nplacing female pre-classification detainees in a separate pre-classification holding area so \nthat they would not need to be strip searched, or (2) placing male pre-classification \ndetainees in general population so that they, too, would be strip searched.  R&R at 17.  In \nits response in opposition to the R&R, Beaufort County focuses on why โthe record does \nnot support a genuine issue of material fact as to either of these alleged alternatives.โ  \nECF No. 79 at 17.   \nFirst, Beaufort County argues that there is no evidence in the record to support \nthat the County โcould have simply relocated female pre-classification detainees \n \n9 Additionally, the court echoes the R&R by noting that though contraband raises \nobvious security concerns in a prison setting, the โYear End Reports for [BCDC]โ for \n2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015, show that defendants conducted 18,402 โshakedownsโ of \ninmatesโ cells prior to adoption of the strip-search practice at issue here and found no \nserious contraband at BCDC.  See R&R at 16 n.11 (citing ECF No. 56-1).  \n16 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 17 of 23\nsomewhere outside of general population.โ  Id.  Rather, to do so the County would have \nbeen required to construct new buildingsโwhich the County argues would impose much \nmore than a de minimis burden.  Id. at 17โ18.  Beaufort County argues that the R&Rโs \nconsideration of this issue improperly placed to burden on the County to explain the \nfunding and space constraints.  Id. at 19 (citing R&R at 18).10  As such, the County urges \nthe court to find that this first alternative was not truly a viable alternativeโcertainly not \none that would impose nothing more than a de minimis burden to the Countyโs \npenological interests.  Id.   \nThe court agrees with the R&R and finds that defendantsโ arguments regarding \nfunding and space constraints arguments are unavailing.  See R&R at 17.  โVague and \ngeneral references to funding and space constraints cannot justify a policy that resulted \ndirectly in the strip and visual body cavity searches of thousands of female arrestees, \nwhile permitting their male counterparts to rest in the relative comfort and security of [] \nlockups.โ  Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F. Supp. 3d 131, 151 (D. Mass. 2001); see also \nVictory v. Berks Cnty., 2019 WL 5266147, at *14 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 17, 2019) (denying \nsummary judgment where county defendant failed to address why female inmates were \ntreated differently than male inmates with regards to housing beyond conclusory remarks \n \n10 Further, the defendantsโ critique of the R&R for misplacing the burden of proof \nis without meritโread in full, the R&R clearly based its conclusions on the plaintiffsโ \npleadings and briefs.  See R&R at 18 (citing ECF No. 56-3, Davis Dep. at 16:12โ23, \n17:8โ11, 19:3โ12) (โAs noted by Plaintiffs, during the course of the second study, \nDefendants did not attempt to identify space that could house female pre-classification \ndetainee.โ).  Certainly, the R&R noted that โDefendants have not offered any explanation \nor argument to address the funding and space constraints,โ but in so doing the magistrate \njudge acknowledged that the plaintiffs raised this as an issue in their response in \nopposition to the motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 56 at 12โ14, to which \ndefendants replied without adequately addressing that deficit, ECF No. 63 at 7.   \n \n17 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 18 of 23\nabout the structure of the reentry center and limited employee bandwidth).  Fiscal \nlimitation concerns cannot justify unconstitutional conduct.  See Bukhari v. Hutto, 487 F. \nSupp. 1162, 1171โ72 (E.D. Va. 1980).  However, even if the court were to credit the \ndefendantsโ argument and find that the first alternative imposed more than a de minimis \nburdenโwhich it does notโthe second alternative, strip search everybody, even more \nclearly shows that a constitutional alternative existed that the defendants could have \nemployed rather than continue with an unequal gender-based practice.    \nSecond, Beaufort County argues that also housing male pre-classification \ndetainees among general population inmates would not merely incur a de minimis \nimpact.  ECF No. 79 at 19.  Rather, it would greatly increase the opportunities for \ncontraband to be introduced into the general population.  Id.  It would also require \nsignificantly more resources as every detainee entering general population would need to \nbe strip searched, which would quickly consume โthe [c]ountyโs scarce resources.โ  Id. at \n19โ20.  In evaluating these arguments, the court may consider the defendantsโ voluntary \nchange from a discriminatory policy to a non-discriminatory policy to find that a readily \navailable constitutional alternative existed.  Jones v. Murphy, 567 F. Supp. 2d 787, 791 \n(D. Md. 2008) (finding relevant to the fourth Morrison factor that the prisonโs later \ndecision to search all arrestees to their last layer of clothing regardless of gender \ndemonstrated a clear and readily available constitutional alternative to the prisonโs \npreviously gender-discriminatory strip search policy).  As defendants have conceded, \nbecause of COVID-19 protocols, pre-classification males are now also held in general \npopulation and, thus, are also strip searched.  R&R at 3 n.6 (citing ECF No. 40-1, Grant \nAff. ยถ 7).  There is no evidence before the court to suggest that this change strained \n18 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 19 of 23\nBCDC resources, and when the magistrate judge noted as much, the defendants failed to \nrebut such a finding in either their response in opposition or their sur-reply.  See R&R at \n18; ECF Nos. 79, 81.  This alternative demonstrates that the County was able to treat \nmale and female pre-classification detainees equally at de minimis cost to valid \npenological interests, but chose not to.  R&R at 18โ19.   \nAs such, the court finds that there exists a dispute over a material fact as to the \nconstitutionality of Beaufort Countyโs practice of placing female pre-classification \ndetainees in general population and subjecting them to strip searches, when male pre-\nclassification detainees were housed separate from convicted prisoners and not subjected \nto such searches.  For the foregoing reasons, the court denies the motion for summary \njudgment on Count 2 as alleged against Beaufort County.   \nB.  Count 10: Attorneysโ Fees (42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b)) \nThe R&R recommended that summary judgment be denied for plaintiffsโ request \nfor attorneysโ fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  Defendants object to Count 10 but provide \nno reasoning for their objection.  See generally ECF No. 79.  Section 1988(b) provides \nthat in an action to enforce a provision of ยง 1983โhere, the equal protection claims \nagainst Beaufort Countyโthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a \nreasonable attorneyโs fee as part of the costs.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  Since the equal \nprotection claim against Beaufort County survives, so too does the claim for affiliated \nattorneysโ fees.   \nC.  Count 6: Outrage/Reckless Infliction of Emotional Distress \nAt issue in Count 6 is whether plaintiffs may recover for reckless infliction of \nemotional distress since the SCTCA explicitly excluded liability for intentional infliction \n19 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 20 of 23\nof emotional harm by a government entity.  See R&R at 26โ28.  The R&R recommended \nthat summary judgment be denied for outrage (i.e., reckless infliction of emotional \ndistress) because a plain reading of the SCTCA indicates only intentional, not reckless, \nconduct is included.  Id. at 28.  Defendants object to this conclusion and argue that the \nSCTCA bars plaintiffsโ outrage claims and rest their argument on a laundry list of court \ncases purportedly holding as much.11  ECF No. 79 at 20.  The court examines these \narguments in turn. \nThe court starts with the elements of an outrage claim.  Under South Carolina law, \nintentional infliction of emotional distress is also known as the tort of outrage.  Callum v. \nCVS Health Corp., 137 F. Supp. 3d 817, 856 (D.S.C. 2015).  The South Carolina \nSupreme Court has โheld that in order to recover for intentional inflict of emotional \ndistress, the complaining party must establish that: \n(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional \ndistress, or was certain, or substantially certain, that such distress would \nresult from his conduct; \n(2) the conduct was so โextreme and outrageousโ so as to exceed โall \npossible bounds of decencyโ and must be regarded as โatrocious, and utterly \nintolerable in a civilized community;โ \n \n11 Defendants cite several cases that ostensibly hold that the SCTCA bars outrage \nclaims against government entities, See ECF No. 79 at 21โ22 (citing Newman v.

App. 2011); accord. Lindquist v. Tanner, 2012 WL 3839237, at \n*4 (D.S.C. Apr. 12, 2012), report & recommendation adopted in part, 2012 WL 3839235 \n(D.S.C. Sept. 4, 2012).  The magistrate judge discounted this string citation by explaining \nthat defendants failed to differentiate between outrage cases based on reckless conduct \nversus those based on intentional conduct when considering a bar by the SCTCA.  R&R \nat 27.  The court similarly finds these citations not entirely instructive as to the specific \nnuance at issue.   \n20 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 21 of 23\n(3) the actions of the defendant caused plaintiff's emotional distress; and \n(4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was โsevereโ such that \nโno reasonable man could be expected to endure it.โ \nHansson v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 650 S.E.2d 68, 70 (S.C. 2007) (quoting Ford v. \nHutson, 276 S.E.2d 776,778 (S.C. 1981) (adopting elements from Rest. (2d) of Torts \nยง 46)) (emphasis added).  Importantly, the conduct that may give rise to an outrage claim \nmay be either intentional or reckless.  See id.  However, though varying levels of conduct \nmay give rise to an outrage claim, the name of the tort remains the same: intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress.  Id.   \nIn pertinent part, the SCTCA defines โlossโ to mean โbodily injury, disease, \ndeath, or damage, to tangible property, including lost wages and economic loss to the \nperson who suffered the injury, disease, or death, pain and suffering, mental anguish, and \nany other element of actual damages recoverable in actions for negligence, but does not \ninclude the intentional infliction of emotional harm.โ  S.C. Code. ยง 15-78-30(f) (emphasis \nadded).  Thus, the court is confronted with a question of ambiguity: whether the \nlegislature in drafting the statute referenced the tort of intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress or referenced the state of mind requirement for outrage claims such that only a \nsubclass of claimsโthose alleging reckless behaviorโwere permissible as asserted \nagainst the State.12   \n \n12 In contrast, the R&R found the statutory construction unambiguous.  See R&R \nat 28.  According to the magistrate judge and the plaintiffs, โa plain reading of the \nSCTCA indicates that only intentional, not reckless, conduct is included, and โ[t]he Court \nis not required to examine statutory construction when the statute is plain and \nunambiguous.โโ  Id. (quoting Thao v. Nationwide Affinity Ins. Co. of Am., 2018 WL \n2971784, at *4 (D.S.C. June 13, 2018).  As such, since the plaintiffs limited the \nallegations in their amended complaint to โrecklessโ conduct, the magistrate judge could \nnot say that the claims were barred by the SCTCA at this stage of the litigation.  Id.   \n21 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 22 of 23\nThis court is not the first court to confront this ambiguity.  The magistrate judge \nnoted one South Carolina Supreme Court case that in applying the law of outrage \nimplicitly accepted that outrage claims based in recklessness were not barred.  R&R at 28 \n(citing Bass v. S.C. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 780 S.E.2d 252 (S.C. 2015) (upholding a \ngeneral jury verdict against state agency on SCTCA claims of gross negligence and \noutrage premised on reckless conduct)).  However, this court has previously weighed in \non this issue and directly considered whether the SCTCA bars outrage claims based in \nrecklessness and held all outrage claims to be barred.  See, e.g., Anderson v. Dorchester \nCnty., 2021 WL 1186637, at *15 (D.S.C. Mar. 30, 2021).  This courtโs decision and \nreasoning were adopted by another court in the district.  Faulkner v. York Cnty. Sch. \nDist., 2022 WL 673684, at *9 (D.S.C. Mar. 7, 2022) (applying the reasoning in \nAnderson).  The court sees no need to diverge from its previous analysis, but nevertheless \nreiterates the most salient features.  First, South Carolina courts have long treated \nreckless conduct as possessing an element of willfulness, which more closely aligns with \nintentional torts than those arising from negligence.  Anderson, 2021 WL 1186637, at \n*15.  Second and more fundamentally, โit [is] hard to believe that the South Carolina \nlegislature would explicitly exclude from recovery any loss caused by โthe intentional \ninfliction of emotional harm,โ but not exclude from recovery the very same harm when \nthe emotional distress was inflicted recklessly.โ  Id. (quoting S.C. Code ยง 15-78-30(f)).  \nThe language of the SCTCA is also informative because it explicitly asserts that โ[t]he \nprovision of this chapter establishing limitations on and exemptions to the liability of the \nState . . . must be liberally construed in favor of limiting the liability of the state.โ  S.C. \nCode ยง 15-78-20(f).  In aggregate, the court is convinced that the SCTCA as drafted \n22 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 03/27/23    Entry Number 82     Page 23 of 23\nintended to bar all outrage torts brought against the State, not just those alleging \nintentional conduct.        \nConsequently, the court departs from the magistrate judgeโs recommendation in \nthis respect and instead grants defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on Count 6, \nfinding that plaintiffsโ claim of outrage against Beaufort County is barred by the SCTCA.            \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons the court ADOPTS the R&R in part and REJECTS the \nR&R in part and GRANTS the motion in part and DENIES the motion in part.  \nSpecifically, the court ADOPTS the R&Rโs recommendation that defendantsโ motion for \nsummary judgment be GRANTED as to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 2 (as asserted \nagainst individual defendants).  The court also ADOPTS the R&Rโs recommendation \nthat defendantsโ motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to Counts 2 (as asserted \nagainst Beaufort County) and 10.  Finally, the court REJECTS the R&Rโs \nrecommendation and GRANTS defendantsโ motion for summary judgment as to Count \n6.   \n  AND IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \nDAVID C.

Cherryโs report and recommendation (โR&Rโ), ECF No. 49, that the court grant \nplaintiffs Cheryl A. Munday (โMundayโ) and Margaret Devineโs (โDevineโ) motion for \nclass certification, ECF No. 31.  For the reasons set forth below, the court adopts the \nR&R with certain clarifications and grants the motion.  \nI.   BACKGROUND \n  The R&R ably recites the facts, and the parties do not object to the R&Rโs \nrecitation thereof.  Therefore, the court will only briefly summarize material facts as they \nappear in the R&R for the purpose of aiding an understanding of the courtโs legal \nanalysis.  \n1 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 2 of 12\nThis case involves certain procedures used for female pre-classification detainees \nat the Beaufort County Detention Center (โBCDCโ).1  Defendant Beaufort County (the \nโCountyโ) operates BCDC.  Defendant Philip Foot (โFootโ) is the Assistant County \nAdministrator for the Public Safety Division who oversees the BCDC.  Defendant \nQuandara Grant (โGrantโ) is a colonel and the director of the BCDC.  BCDCโs practice \nhas been to house female pre-classification inmates in general population while placing \nmale pre-classification inmates in a separate pre-classification cell outside of general \npopulation.  On February 27, 2015, BCDC began conducting strip and visual body cavity \nsearches on any pre-classification detainee placed in general population.  ECF Nos. 31-4 \nand 31-5.  Accordingly, because female pre-classification detainees were held in general \npopulation, BCDC conducted a strip and visual body cavity search on every female pre-\nclassification detainee awaiting bond.  BCDC did not, however, do so for similarly-\nsituated male pre-classification detainees prior to May 5, 2020, as they were housed in a \nseparate pre-classification cell outside of general population.  There is generally no \ndispute between the parties that this practice was in effect at BCDC between February 27, \n2015 and May 5, 2020. \nMunday and Devine (together, โplaintiffsโ) were arrested in March 2018 and \nJanuary 2019, respectively, for driving under the influence.  The charges against both \nwere later dismissed.  After the respective arresting officers transported each plaintiff to \nBCDC to begin the booking process, both underwent a full body pat down followed by a \nstrip search and visual body cavity search.  On March 6, 2020, plaintiffs initiated this \n \n1 A pre-classification detainee is an inmate who has been arrested and placed or \nhoused in an area at the detention center prior to going to his or her bond hearing.  ECF \nNo. 34-1 at 2. \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 3 of 12\naction asserting various state and federal claims against BCDC, the County, Foot, Grant, \ndefendants John Does 1โ5, and defendants Jane Does 1โ5 (together, โdefendantsโ) on \nbehalf of themselves and others similarly situated.   \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Civil Rule \n73.02(B)(2)(g) (D.S.C), all pretrial proceedings in this case were referred to Magistrate \nJudge Cherry.  On December 1, 2022, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification.  \nECF No. 31.  In that motion, plaintiffs sought to certify a class solely for their claim \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging a violation of the equal protection clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  On May 2, 2022, Magistrate \nJudge Cherry issued the R&R, recommending that the court grant the motion.  ECF No. \n49.  On May 16, 2022, defendants objected to the R&R.  ECF No. 55.  Plaintiffs did not \nfile objections or respond to defendantsโ objections, and the time to do so has now \nexpired.  As such, the matter is now ripe for the courtโs review.  \nII.   STANDARD \nThis court is charged with conducting a de novo review of any portion of a \nmagistrate judgeโs R&R to which specific, written objections are made.  28 U.S.C. \nยง 636(b)(1).  A partyโs failure to object is accepted as agreement with the conclusions of \na magistrate judge.  See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 149โ50 (1985).  The \nrecommendation of the Magistrate Judge carries no presumptive weight, and the \nresponsibility to make a final determination rests with this court.  Mathews v. Weber, 423 \nU.S. 261, 270โ71 (1976).  However, de novo review is unnecessary when a party makes \ngeneral and conclusory objections without directing a courtโs attention to a specific error \nin a magistrate judgeโs proposed findings.  Orpiano v. Johnson, 687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 4 of 12\n1982).  In the absence of a specific objection, the court reviews the R&R only for clear \nerror.  Diamond v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 315 (4th Cir. 2005) \n(citation omitted).   \n  The class action is โan exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by \nand on behalf of the individual named parties only.โ  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. \n682, 700โ701 (1979).  Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23, under which a proposed class must both satisfy the prerequisites for certification \noutlined in Rule 23(a) and constitute one of the permissible โtypes of class actionsโ under \nRule 23(b).  Rule 23(a) provides that one or more members of a class may sue as \nrepresentative parties on behalf of all only if:  \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) \nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses \nof the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class. \n  \nFurther, Rule 23(b) requires that class certification be appropriate based on one or more \nof the following circumstances: (1) individual actions would risk inconsistent \nadjudications, or adjudications dispositive of non-parties; (2) class-wide injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief is sought and appropriate; or (3) legal or factual questions, common to \nthe proposed class members, predominate over questions affecting individual members.  \nGunnells v. Healthplan Servs., 348 F.3d 417, 423 (4th Cir. 2003).  In addition to these \nexplicit requirements, โRule 23 contains an implicit threshold requirement that the \nmembers of a proposed class be โreadily identifiable,โโ which courts often refer as to the \nโascertainabilityโ requirement.  EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 358 (4th Cir. \n2014).  \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 5 of 12\n  The party seeking certification carries the burden of demonstrating that each of \nthe requirements for class certification is satisfied.  Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 368 \nF.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2004).  That burden requires the party seeking certification to โdo \nmore than plead compliance withโ Rule 23, meaning that it must actually โpresent \nevidence that the putative class complies with Rule 23.โ  Adair, 764 F.3d at 357.  Though \nclass certification should not be โconditioned on the merits of the case,โ Clark v. \nExperian Info. Sols., Inc., 2001 WL 1946329, at *1 (D.S.C. Mar. 19, 2001), โa district \ncourt may need to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification \nquestion,โ Adair, 764 F.3d at 357 (quoting Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 \n(2013)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, โ[a]lthough Rule 23 does not \ngive district courts a โlicense to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification \nstage,โ a court should consider merits questions to the extent โthat they are relevant to \ndetermining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.โโ  Id. \n(quoting Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 464 (2013)).  \n  District courts are to โgive Rule 23 a liberal rather than a restrictive construction, \nadopting a standard of flexibility in application which will in the particular case best \nserve the ends of justice for the affected parties and . . . promote judicial efficiency.โ  \nGunnells, 348 F.3d at 424.  Ultimately, the court โhas broad discretion in deciding \nwhether to certify a class, but that discretion must be exercised within the framework of \nRule 23.โ  Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting In re \nAm. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. 1996)). \n \n \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 6 of 12\nIII.   DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs seek certification of a class based on the alleged violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment equal protection rights of women who the BCDC subjected to \nstrip and visual body cavity searches.  Plaintiffs proposed the following class definition: \nโFemale pre-classification detainees in the custody of BCDC who, upon their admission \nor return to BCDC from outside of BCDC, were strip/visual body cavity searched, while \npre-classification males were not, from February 27, 2015, until the class period closes.โ  \nECF No. 31 at 12.  \nIn the R&R, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the court certify the \nfollowing revised class definition: โFemale pre-classification detainees in the custody of \nBCDC who, upon their admission to BCDC, were strip/visual body cavity searched, \nwhile pre-classification males were not, from February 27, 2015, until May 5, 2020.โ   \nECF No. 49 at 4 (footnotes omitted). \nSpecifically, in relevant part, the Magistrate Judge deleted the phrase โor return to \nBCDC from outside of BCDCโ from the definition.  The Magistrate Judge set forth the \nfollowing reasoning for removing this language from the class definition:  \nPlaintiffsโ proposed class originally included the phrase โor return to BCDC \nfrom outside of BCDCโ in addition to โupon their admission to BCDC.โ  \nECF No. 31 at 1.  Plaintiffsโ counsel conceded at the hearing that phrase \nshould be removed from the proposed class definition, as it would include \nindividuals who had been denied bond and were returned to BCDC and, as \nsuch, would have been subject to a strip search, regardless of gender.  \n \nSee id. at 4 n.9. \n \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 7 of 12\n  Defendants object to the R&R and the class definition therein in three \nrespects.  The court discusses each objection in turn below.2  \nA.   South Carolina Law Regarding Class Actions Against Political \nSubdivisions \n \nDefendants first generally object to the R&Rโs recommendation that the court \ncertify the class action, arguing that S.C. Code ยง 12-60-80(C), which is contained in the \nchapter known as the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act (โRPAโ), precludes a class \naction against the BCDC and the County.  Section 12-60-80(C) provides that โa claim or \naction for the refund of taxes may not be brought as a class action in . . . any court of law \nin this State, and the department,3 political subdivisions, or their instrumentalities may \nnot be named or made a defendant in any other class action brought in this State.โ  S.C. \nCode ยง 12-60-80(C) (emphasis added).  Defendants argue that the underlined โcatch-allโ \nlanguage in the statute prohibits any class action against South Carolina political \nsubdivisions and instrumentalitiesโincluding BCDC and the County.  In support of this \nargument, defendants suggest that in Aiken v. South Carolina Department of Revenue, \n839 S.E.2d 96 (S.C. 2020), the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the โcatch-allโ \nlanguage of ยง 12-60-80(C) precludes all class actions against governmental entities, not \nmerely those for the refund of โtaxes.โ  According to defendants, because this lawsuit has \nbeen filed against a political subdivision and its instrumentalities, ยง 12-60-80(C) prohibits \nclass certification in this matter. \n \n2 The court reviews the portions of the R&R to which no objections were filed for \nclear error and, finding none, adopts those portions of the R&R. \n3 โDepartmentโ is defined as the South Carolina Department of Revenue. \nS.C. Code ยง 12-60-30(9). \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 8 of 12\nNotably, defendants did not raise this argument in their response to the motion to \ncertify class, and the court may overrule the objection on this basis alone.4  Regardless, \nthe objection lacks merit because even if the RPA purported to bar all class actions \nagainst state entities, that bar would not apply to the class action in this federal case.   \nA recent case in this district, In re Jones, 618 B.R. 757 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2020), is \ninstructive on the matter.  In that case, debtors commenced a putative class action \nasserting certain causes of action under federal bankruptcy law against a South Carolina \nhealth services district that operated a medical center.  The defendant district argued that \nit was a political subdivision and that pursuant to S.C. Code ยง 12-60-80(C)โand Aikenโs \ninterpretation thereofโa political subdivision lacked the capacity to be named as a party \nin a class action lawsuit.  The court rejected that argument, explaining that โthe United \nStates Supreme Court held in Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate \nInsurance Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010) that a state law class action bar cannot trump Rule \n23โs authorization of class actions in federal court proceedings.โ  In re Jones, 618 B.R. at \n763.  Accordingly, โ[w]hile the state of South Carolina can certainly place limitations on \nlitigantsโ abilities to bring certain actions in state court, those limitations do not extend to \ncauses of action brought under federal bankruptcy law, in the bankruptcy court.โ  Id. at \n \n4 โA petitioner whose case is referred to the Magistrate Judge for initial handling \n(for findings, conclusions, and recommendation) cannot for the first time in his objections \nto the Magistrate Judgeโs findings, conclusions, and recommendation raise a ground not \nasserted in the petition as it existed when the matter was before the Magistrate Judge for \nconsideration.โ  Thornton v. Johnson, 2001 WL 331983, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 3, 2001); \nsee also Clark v. Thompson, 2014 WL 1234347, at *2 (D.S.C. March 25, 2014) (noting \nthat a partyโs new argument raised for the first time in his objections โmust be overruled \nas untimely and thus improperโ); Buford v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, 2018 WL \n6617646, at *3 (E.D. Va. Dec. 18, 2018) (โParties may not raise \nentirely new arguments for the first time in their objections to a magistrate judgeโs \nreport.โ).   \n8 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 9 of 12\n769.  Likewise, here, any South Carolina bar on class actions against the BCDC and the \nCounty does not extend to plaintiffsโ class action brought under ยง 1983 for alleged \nviolations of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause.  As the court stated in \nIn re Jones,  \nWhatever  the  effect  of  the  South  Carolina  Supreme  Courtโs  holding \nin Aiken may be on other cases, it does not have an effect on this case. As \nstated above, Shady Grove governs and requires the application of Rule \n23.  Aiken, while it may prohibit state class actions and class actions based \non state causes of action, is not instructive here. \n \nId. at 767.  Accordingly, the court finds that this class action brought in federal court and \ngrounded in federal law is not barred by South Carolina law. \n  B.  Specific Exclusion \nNext, defendants propose clarifying the revised class definition in the R&R to \nspecifically exclude from the class women who returned to BCDC from bond hearings.  \nDefendants agree with the Magistrate Judgeโs exclusion of the phrase โor return to BCDC \nfrom outside of BCDCโ from the class definition.  However, defendants contend that, in \nthe context of this class, the court should have expressly excluded those women, by \nincluding the following sentence: โThe class definition expressly excludes any and all \nwomen who returned to BCDC from a bond hearing or other mat[t]er outside of BCDC.โ  \nECF No. 55 at 6. \nAccording to defendants, it is undisputed that men who return to BCDC following \na bond hearing would be strip searched because they are heading to general population. \nTherefore, both men and women who do not post bond would be treated equally and strip \nsearched.  As a result, defendants maintain that there can be no equal protection violation \nas to women who are so situated.  Therefore, defendants argue that it is inappropriate for \n9 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 10 of 12\nthe class to potentially include such women.  They ask that the court amend the class \ndefinition to expressly exclude women who return to BCDC from bond hearings. \nThe court resolves to include the clarification sentence in the class definition.  \nPlaintiffs have previously agreed to the exclusion articulated in that sentence, so the court \nsees no harm in including the express statement to that effect.  Again, the Magistrate \nJudge observed that โPlaintiffsโ counsel conceded at the hearing that [the phrase โor \nreturn to BCDC from outside of BCDCโ] should be removed from the proposed class \ndefinition, as it would include individuals who had been denied bond and were returned \nto BCDC and, as such, would have been subject to a strip search, regardless of gender.โ  \nECF No. 49 at 4 n.9 (emphasis added).  The phrase defendants propose adding to the \nclass definition is consistent with plaintiffsโ concession, and therefore the court accepts \nthe proposal. \nC.  Limited to Equal Protection Claim \nNext, defendants object to the R&R to the extent it recommends class certification \nthat is not limited to the equal protection claim.  As set forth above, the R&R focuses \nonly on class certification for plaintiffsโ equal protection claim.  Indeed, the Magistrate \nJudge noted that โPlaintiffs have limited their class certification petition to their equal \nprotection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment and are not seeking certification of \nany of the other claims alleged in the Amended Complaint.โ  Id. at 7.  Defendants \ninterpret the R&R as recommending only class certification on the issue of whether \nsubjecting pre-classification women, but not pre-classification men, to strip searches was \nconstitutional.  Despite their understanding of the R&R, however, defendants โobject to \nclass certification [that] includ[es] any other issues, including damages to be awarded to \n10 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 11 of 12\nany class member if the different treatment of pre-classification women and men is found \nto be unconstitutional.โ  ECF No. 55 at 7.   \nThe court overrules the objection.  As defendants properly note, the R&R \nrecommended class certification for the ยง 1983 equal protection claim only.  Therefore, \nthe courtโs adoption of the R&R and grant of the motion to certify class is limited to the \nequal protection claim as well.  Moreover, as it relates to defendantsโ contention that \nclass certification should not include the issue of damages, it appears to the court that the \nR&R did not decide whether damages would be determined on an individualized or class \nbasis.  However, the Magistrate Judge was not required to make such a determination in \ndeciding a motion to certify class.  See Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, \n429 (4th Cir. 2003) (โ[T]he need for individualized proof of damages alone \nwill not defeat class certification.โ); Hill v. W. Elec. Co., Inc., 672 F.2d 381, 387 (4th \nCir. 1982) (โBifurcation of . . . class action proceedings for hearings on . . . damages is \nnow commonplace.โ); Chisolm v. TranSouth Fin. Corp., 184 F.R.D. 556, 566 (E.D. Va. \n1999) (collecting cases).  Nevertheless, while it did not firmly decide the issue, the R&R \nexpressed concerns regarding the impracticability of conducting individualized inquiries \ninto damages.  See ECF No. 49 at 21 (โFor most strip search claimants, class status is \nlikely not only the superior means, but arguably the only feasible one to establish liability \nand damages.โ) (emphasis added); see also Gwiazdowski v. Cnty. of Chester, 263 F.R.D. \n178, 190 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (โ[C]ourts have concluded in similar โstrip search policyโ cases \nthat recovery by each putative class member would likely be small, and that each member \nwould have little incentive to pursue its claims individually[.]โ).  At this juncture, the \n11 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN-MHC     Date Filed 07/14/22    Entry Number 68     Page 12 of 12\ncourt need not resolve the matter, as certification of the class is appropriate regardless of \nhow the court ultimately determines damages.5 \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, the court ADOPTS the R&R as clarified in this \nOrder and GRANTS the motion to certify class in accordance with this Order. \n  AND IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \nDAVID C.

For the reasons set \nforth below, the court denies the motions. \nI.   BACKGROUND \nBecause the parties are well acquainted with this litigation, the court will only \nbriefly summarize material facts for the purpose of aiding an understanding of the courtโs \nlegal analysis. \nThis matter arises from certain practices at the Beaufort County Detention Center \n(โBCDCโ), which is operated by defendant Beaufort County (โBeaufort Countyโ).  See \ngenerally ECF No. 12, Amend. Compl.  The practices at issue are used for pre-\nclassification detainees.1  Once a pre-trial detainee goes to a bond hearing and cannot \n \n1 A pre-classification detainee is an inmate who has been arrested and placed or \nhoused in an area at the detention center prior to going to a bond hearing.  ECF No. 34-1 \nat 20:7โ14.   \n1 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 2 of 23\npost a bond, upon returning to BCDC, he or she is then classified to a different area at \nBCDC, such as in general population or, depending on the inmateโs behavior, maximum \nor super maximum security.  ECF No. 34-3 at 21:3โ18.  On February 27, 2015, BCDC \nadopted a policy (the โpolicyโ) that all inmates moved from pre-classification to other \nareas of BCDC, including general population, would be strip searched.  See ECF No. 31-\n4 at 2.2  However, BCDCโs practice (the โpracticeโ) has been to house female pre-\nclassification inmates in general population while placing male pre-classification inmates \nin a separate pre-classification cell outside of general population.  ECF No. 31-3 at 14, \nBlack Dep. 24:2โ20.  Because female pre-classification inmates are housed in general \npopulation from the outset, the practice, when combined with the policy, resulted in \nBCDC conducting a strip search on every female pre-classification detainee awaiting a \nbond hearing.  ECF No. 40-1 ยถ 6.  BCDC, however, did not do so for similarly situated \nmale pre-classification detainees prior to May 5, 2020, because they were housed in a \nseparate pre-classification cell outside of general population.   \nPlaintiffs allege they were impacted by this practice.  Specifically, each of them \ndescribes being arrested for driving under the influence (each later had that charge \ndismissed), brought into BCDC for holding, and subjected to a public strip search and \nvisual body cavity searchโwhile similarly situated men were not subjected to such a \nsearch.  See generally Amend. Compl. \nPlaintiffs filed the instant case on March 6, 2020, in the Beaufort County Court of \nCommon Pleas on behalf of themselves and a class of all similarly situated women who \n \n2 BCDC adopted the policy through a memorandum sent by Major C.E. Allen \n(โDeputy Director Allenโ), the Deputy Director of BCDC.  ECF No. 31-4 at 2.   \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 3 of 23\nwere subjected to the practice and the policy.3  ECF No. 1-1, Compl.  On June 5, 2020, \nBeaufort County removed the case to federal court.  ECF No. 1.  This case was referred \nto Magistrate Judge Molly Cherry for all pretrial proceedings pursuant to the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g) (D.S.C.).  On \nAugust 5, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, now the operative complaint.  \nECF No. 12, Amend. Compl.  The plaintiffs bring various state and federal claims against \nBeaufort County, Assistant County Administrator for the Public Safety Division Philip \nFoot (โFootโ), Director of the BCDC Colonel Quandara Grant (โDirector Grantโ), John \nDoes 1โ5 (described as โBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ), and Jane Does 1-5 (described \nas โBCDC Officer Defendantsโ) (collectively, โdefendantsโ).  Amend. Compl. ยถยถ 7โ11.  \nOn March 27, 2023, this court issued an order resolving a motion for summary judgment \nwhich dismissed all claims against individual defendants and dismissed many of the \nclaims brought against Beaufort County but denied the motion as to plaintiffsโ claim of \nviolation of the equal protection clause against Beaufort County under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \nas well as plaintiffsโ request for attorneysโ fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  ECF No. 82.  \nOn August 1, 2023, the court denied defendantsโ motion for reconsideration of that order.  \nECF No. 104.   \n \n3 Specifically, the class is defined as  \nall women who have been admitted to the Beaufort County Detention \nCenter while waiting for bail to be set or for an initial court appearance, \nwomen who have been arrested on default warrants and held in the Beaufort \nCounty Detention Center, and women who have been held in protective \ncustody in the Beaufort County Detention Center. . . . These women have \nall been unlawfully subjected to routine strip searches, including degrading \nvisual body cavity searches of their anuses and vaginas. \nAmend. Compl. ยถ 4.  The court granted plaintiffsโ motion for certification on July 14, \n2022.  ECF No. 68.   \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 4 of 23\nOn June 13, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  ECF \nNo. 93.  On July 31, 2023, Beaufort County filed a response in opposition, ECF No. 103, \nto which plaintiffs replied on August 18, 2023, ECF No. 109.  On October 5, 2023, the \ncourt directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of Monell liability.4  The \ncourt thereafter held a conference call with the parties.  The parties filed an amended \nscheduling order on December 19, 2023, which reopened limited discovery and set a \nMarch 2024 deadline for the supplemental briefs addressing Monell liability.  ECF No. \n115.  On March 15, 2024, Beaufort County filed a supplemental memorandum addressing \nMonell liability, ECF No. 116, and plaintiffs filed a supplemental reply in support, ECF \nNo. 117, and a supplemental memorandum addressing Monell liability, ECF No. 118.  \nOn July 23, 2024, Beaufort County filed a supplemental affidavit from Director Grant, \nECF No. 123, Grant Aff., and on July 24, 2024, it filed an affidavit from Sean Stewart \n(โStewartโ), ECF No. 124, Stewart Aff., in response to the pending partial motion for \nsummary judgment.  On August 2, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion to strike the affidavits, \nECF No. 125, to which Beaufort County responded in opposition on August 12, 2024, \nECF No. 127.  The court held a hearing on these motions on August 14, 2024.  ECF No. \n128.  As such, the motions have been fully briefed and are now ripe for review.   \nII.   STANDARD \nSummary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure \nmaterials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(c).  โBy its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some \n \n4 Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978). \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 5 of 23\nalleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly \nsupported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine \nissue of material fact.โ  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247โ48 (1986).  \nโOnly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing \nlaw will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.โ  Id. at 248. โ[S]ummary \njudgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is โgenuine,โ that is, if the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ  \nId.  However, โwhen the movant bears the burden of proof at trial, [s]he โmust do more \nthan put the issue into genuine doubt; indeed [she] must remove genuine doubt from the \nissue altogether.โโ  McIntyre v. Robinson, 126 F. Supp. 2d 394, 400 (D. Md. 2000) \n(quoting Hoover Color Corp. v. Bayer Corp., 199 F.3d 160, 164 (4th Cir. 1999) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted)).  โ[A]t the summary judgment stage the judgeโs \nfunction is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to \ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.โ  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.  The \ncourt should view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and \ndraw all inferences in its favor.  Id. at 255.  \nIII.   DISCUSSION \nA.  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nThe court begins with the motion for partial summary judgment.  Rather than \nsummarizing all filed briefsโwhich included arguments irrelevant to the question of \nmunicipal liabilityโthe court instead only summarizes each partyโs position as to \nwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact that Beaufort County, a municipality, \nmay be liable to plaintiffs should they win this case at trial.   \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 6 of 23\nPlaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment which seeks โjudgment in \ntheir favor with respect to the issue of liability on all remaining causes of action.โ  ECF \nNo. 93 at 1.  In their memo in support, plaintiffs contend that โ[t]here are no genuine \nissues of fact as to the relevant BCDC policy and practice,โ and โ[t]he sole remaining \nissue is whether the practice is constitutional.โ  ECF No. 93-1 at 3.  Plaintiffs emphasize \nthat at least two other courts have granted summary judgment on liability under nearly \nidentical circumstances.  Id. at 10โ12 (citing Ford v. City of Bos., 154 F. Supp. 2d 131, \n151 (D. Mass. 2001); Gary v. Sheahan, 1998 WL 547116, at *7โ10 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, \n1998)).5  Plaintiffs contend that no reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of \nBeaufort County on the question of liability because its challenged practiceโstrip \nsearching female pre-trial detainees but not similarly situated male pre-trial detaineesโ\nfails both the intermediate and more deferential standards of scrutiny.  Id. at 12โ13.  In \nother words, plaintiffs request the court follow the other courts which have granted \nsummary judgment on liability, without providing the court any arguments as to \nmunicipal liability and solely framing their arguments in relation to equal protection.   \nIn response, Beaufort County first notes that plaintiffsโ motion is unusual because \nthey seek summary judgment on an issue for which they bear the burden of proof.  ECF \nNo. 103 at 6.  Stated differently, plaintiffs carry the burden of proving unconstitutionality \nand therefore for the court to grant their motion, the plaintiffs โmust affirmatively make \nan extremely strong showing,โ namely, โthey must remove genuine doubt from the issue \n \n5 Each of these cases addressed Monell liability in reaching the conclusion to hold \nthe municipality liable under ยง 1983 for civil rights violations.  See Ford, 154 F. Supp. 2d \nat 144โ46; Gary, 1998 WL 547116, at *4โ6.  Only after reaching the municipal liability \nconclusions did each court consider the equal protection arguments to which plaintiffs \ncite.  See 93-1 at 10โ12. \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 7 of 23\naltogether.โ  Id. at 6โ7 (quoting Hoover Color Corp., 199 F.3d at 164) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Beaufort County thereafter provides arguments related to equal \nprotection without addressing municipal liability.  See generally ECF No. 103. \nIn reply, plaintiffs reiterate their position as to equal protection, with no \nreferences to municipal liability.  See generally ECF No. 109.   \nDespite solely seeking summary judgment against Beaufort County with respect \nto liability, the parties each failed to brief the issue of municipal liability in the motion for \npartial summary judgment or the subsequent response briefs.  See generally ECF Nos. \n93-1; 103; 109.  The court directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing \nmunicipal liability pursuant to Monell and its progeny and each party filed those briefs in \nMarch 2024.  ECF Nos. 116; 117; 118.  The parties did not confine those briefs to the \nquestion of municipal liability; instead, each party reiterates its position as to the \nremaining equal protection claim and Beaufort County asserts new arguments regarding \ndamages and the statute of limitations.  The court will summarize only the arguments \nrelated to municipal liability. \nBeaufort County concludes its introduction by saying that โif anything, the Court \nshould grant the County summary judgment because Plaintiffs cannot create a genuine \nissue of material fact as to municipal liability under Monell.โ 6  ECF No. 116 at 2 \n(emphasis in original).  It identifies the four theories of Monell liability and explains that \n \n6 Beaufort County has it bass ackwards.  It previously filed a motion for summary \njudgment that failed to brief the issue of municipal liability.  ECF No. 48.  The court \ngranted in part and denied in part that motion.  ECF No. 82.  Presently before the court is \nplaintiffsโ motion for partial summary judgment.  ECF No. 93.  It is plaintiffsโ burden to \nestablish that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to municipal liability.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Conversely, if Beaufort County disagrees, it is the countyโs burden \nto show that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to municipal liability.   \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 8 of 23\nplaintiffs have not carried their burden of establishing municipal liability.  Id. at 6โ17.  \nFirst, it argues that the plaintiffs do not allege that the purported equal protection \nviolations were pursuant to express county policy.  Id. at 7โ8.  It contends that, rather \nthan alleging discriminatory language in any formal written county policy, plaintiffs \ninstead focus on Beaufort Countyโs alleged practice, which is not an express county \npolicy.  Id.  Second, it claims that plaintiffs have not presented any evidence of who \ndecided to strip search all female pre-classification detainees and whether that person was \na final policymaker.  Id. at 10โ11.  To the extent that plaintiffs now argue that Director \nGrant is a final policymaker who enacted that policy, Beaufort County argues that she \nserves under the County Administrator and the County Council, which are the \nappropriate โfinal policymakersโ for this theory of liability.  Id. at 12โ14.  Third, \nBeaufort County argues that plaintiffs have not presented any evidence of omissions by \nthe countyโsuch as training in constitutional violations or the lack thereofโwhich \ncaused the alleged gender discrimination that could give rise to municipal liability under \nthe third theory of liability.  Id. at 14โ15.  Fourth, it asserts that plaintiffs have not \npresented any evidence that the county policymakersโwhich Beaufort County identifies \nas the County Council or the County Administratorโever had actual or constructive \nknowledge of the challenged practice of disparate treatment of female versus male pre-\nclassification detainees, such that the practice is not fairly attributable to Beaufort \nCounty.  Id. at 16โ17.  In sum, Beaufort County claims that there is a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact as to municipal liability such that the court should deny the partial motion \nfor summary judgment.  Id. at 7โ17.  Beaufort County thereafter provides additional \n8 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 9 of 23\narguments against plaintiffsโ case unrelated to the liability question at issue in this \nmotion.7  Id. at 17โ30.   \nPlaintiffs filed two supplemental briefs.  ECF Nos. 117; 118.  The first solely \nfocuses on their equal protection claims against Beaufort County and reiterates many of \nthe equal protection arguments made in their original motion for partial summary \njudgment.  ECF No. 117 at 2โ9.  This brief is wholly irrelevant to the question of \nmunicipal liability.  See id.  The second focuses on municipal liability.  ECF No. 118.  \nPlaintiffs argue that they have identified a specific municipal policy or custom: the \ndetention centerโs practice of conducting strip searches of all pre-classification female \ndetainees, but not similarly situated male detainees.  Id. at 5.  An unconstitutional \nmunicipal policy can be found not only in municipal ordinances or regulations, but also \ncan be found โin formal or informal ad hoc โpolicyโ choices or decisions of municipal \nofficials authorized to make and implement municipal policy.โ  Id. at 6 (citing Spell v. \nMcDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380, 1385โ86 (4th Cir. 1987)).  Moreover, plaintiffs claim that \nBeaufort County โfailed to stop or to correct the widespread pattern of unconstitutional \nconduct which lasted over five years and included thousands of constitutional violations.โ  \nId.  This pattern was so persistent โthat it constituted a custom as contemplated by \nMonell.โ  Id. at 7.  Plaintiffs assert that โ[t]his is not a case in which the actions of \nindividual county employees cannot be attributed to the county itselfโ and โ[t]here is no \nattempt to impose liability on [Beaufort County] on the basis of respondeat superior.โ  Id.   \n \n7 Namely, that some of the plaintiffsโ claims are time-barred, that plaintiffs have \nnot demonstrated that there was an โeasyโ solution available to the county, and that \nplaintiffs may only recover nominal damages.  ECF No. 116 at 17โ30. \n9 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 10 of 23\nMunicipalities and other local government units may be held liable under ยง 1983.  \nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690.  But โa municipality cannot be held liable solely because it \nemploys a tortfeasorโor, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under \nยง 1983 on a respondeat superior theory.โ  Id. at 691; see Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. \n51, 60 (2011) (holding that local governments โare not vicariously liable under ยง 1983 for \ntheir employeesโ actionsโ).  Beyond identifying a policy or practice that may be \nattributable to the governmental unit, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that, through its \ndeliberate conduct, the municipality was the โmoving forceโ behind the injury alleged.  \nSee Bd. of Cnty. Commโrs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997) (emphasis in original).  In \nother words, a plaintiff must show that the action was taken with the requisite degree of \nculpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the action and the \ndeprivation of federal rights.  Id.  Indeed, โ[t]he first inquiry in any case alleging \nmunicipal liability under ยง 1983 is the question whether there is a direct causal link \nbetween a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation.โ  City \nof Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (1989). \nThus, a plaintiff who seeks to assert a ยง 1983 claim against a municipality is \nobliged to โto identify a municipal โpolicyโ or โcustomโ that caused the plaintiffโs injury.โ  \nBd. of Cnty. Commโrs, 520 U.S. at 403 (citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 694).  As interpreted \nby the Fourth Circuit, a โpolicy or customโ can exist in four ways: \n(1) through an express policy, such as a written ordinance or regulation; (2) \nthrough the decisions of a person with final policymaking authority; (3) \nthrough  an  omission,  such  as  a  failure  to  properly  train  officers,  that \nโmanifest[s] deliberate indifference to the rights of citizensโ; or (4) through \na practice that is so โpersistent and widespreadโ as to constitute a โcustom \nor usage with the force of law.โ \n \n10 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 11 of 23\nLytle v. Doyle, 326 F.3d 463, 471 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting Carter v. Morris, 164 F.3d \n215, 218 (4th Cir. 1999)).  The Fourth Circuit has long recognized that Monell and its \nprogeny require the plaintiff to adequately plead and prove the existence of an official \npolicy or custom that proximately caused a deprivation of rights.  Walker v. Prince \nGeorgeโs Cnty., 575 F.3d 426, 431 (4th Cir. 2009).  The identification of a specific \nmunicipal policy or custom is a threshold requirement.  See Semple v. City of \nMoundsville, 195 F.3d 708, 712 (4th Cir. 1999).   \nStated differently, municipal liability results only when the policy or customโas \ndefined by one of the four Monell theoriesโis also (1) fairly attributable to the \nmunicipality as its โownโ and (2) the โmoving force behind the particular constitutional \nviolation.  Spell, 824 F.2d at 1386โ87 (first citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 683; and then \nciting Polk Cnty. v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 326 (1981)).  In practical terms, that means \nthat beyond identifying one of the four Monell theories, the plaintiff must also \ndemonstrate that, through the countyโs deliberate conduct, it was the โmoving forceโ \nbehind the injury alleged.  See Bd. of Cnty. Commโrs, 520 U.S. at 404.  A plaintiff must \nshow that the action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must \ndemonstrate a direct causal like between the action and the deprivation of federal rights.  \nId.   \nThe court starts by addressing the four Monell theoriesโwhich include an \nanalysis of whether the policy or custom is fairly attributable to Beaufort Countyโbefore \nreaching the issue of causation.  The court ultimately concludes that there are genuine \nissues of material fact that preclude a finding of partial summary judgment on the \nquestion of municipal liability.   \n11 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 12 of 23\nPlaintiffs do not specify which of the four ways a โpolicy or customโ exists in this \ncase to establish Monell liability.  See generally ECF No. 118 at 5โ8.  Instead, they \nidentify that โthe strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which [plaintiffs] were \nsubjected were performed pursuant to [Beaufort Countyโs] policy and practice to \nindiscriminately search all or a large number of women but not men being processed into \nthe jail.โ  Id. at 5 (citing ECF No. 12 at 29).  Plaintiffs do not specify that the practice (1) \nwas an express policy; (2) was established through the decisions of someone with final \ndecision-making authority for Beaufort County; (3) through an omission that manifests \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of citizens; or (4) through a practice that is so \npersistent and widespread as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.  See \ngenerally id. at 5โ8.  Instead, plaintiffs provide arguments that fall into multiple \ncategories.  Compare id. at 6 (implicating the first and second theories by arguing that a \npolicy may also be found in formal or informal ad hoc policy choices or decisions of \nmunicipal officials authorized to make and implicate municipal policy); with id. \n(implicating the third and fourth theories by contending that Beaufort County failed to \nstop or to correct the widespread pattern of unconstitutional conduct which lasted over \nfive years).  Given the uncertainty, the court will review each of the four ways that a \npolicy or custom could exist to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material \nfact.  The court ultimately concludes that there remain genuine issues of material fact for \neach Monell theory such that summary judgment is denied.   \n1.  Express Policy \nA municipality may deprive a plaintiff of her constitutional rights, triggering \nMonell liability under Section 1983, through an express policy typically embodied in its \n12 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 13 of 23\nwritten ordinances or regulations.  See Lytle, 326 F.3d at 471.  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit \nhas characterized โthe enactment of legislation as the prototypical conduct that can give \nrise to liability under Monell.โ  Berkley v. Common Council of Charleston, 63 F.3d 295, \n299 (4th Cir. 1995) (en banc).   \nPlaintiffs do not identify an express policy.  See ECF No. 118 at 6.  At most, \nplaintiffs identify Beaufort Countyโs โpolicy and practice to indiscriminately search all or \na large number of women but not men being processed into [BCDC].โ  Id. at 5 (quoting \nECF No. 12 at 29).  The practice of strip-searching all female pre-classification detainees \nbut not all male pre-classification detainees is not an express policy because it was not a \nwritten ordinance, regulation, or enacted legislation.  See Lytle, 326 F.3d at 471; Berkley, \n63 F.3d at 299.  Alternatively, plaintiffs point to the policy which arose from a written \nmemorandum sent by Deputy Director Allen on February 27, 2015.  See ECF No. 31-4 at \n2.  To reiterate, the policy directed that all inmates moved from pre-classification to other \nareas of BCDC, including general population, would be strip searched.  See id.  This \nmemorandum is not a written ordinance, regulation, or enacted legislation and therefore \ndoes not qualify as an express policy.  See Lytle, 326 F.3d at 471; Berkley, 63 F.3d at \n299.  Unsurprisingly, Beaufort County highlights that plaintiffs fail to challenge county \nโlegislation, ordinances, regulations, or official county policy that elected officials have \nenacted.โ  ECF No. 116 at 7.  Moreover, it notes that โ[p]laintiffs do not claim that the \nlanguage of any formal written [c]ounty policy is discriminatory.โ  Id.  The court agrees \nwith Beaufort County and finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden to show no \ngenuine issue of material fact as to this first method of establishing municipal liability.   \n \n13 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 14 of 23\n2.  Decision of Final Policymaker \nNot every decision by every municipal official will subject a municipality to \nsection 1983 liability.  Riddick v. Sch. Bd. of Portsmouth, 238 F.3d 518, 523 (4th Cir. \n2000).  Rather, municipal liability attaches โonly where the decisionmaker possesses final \nauthority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.โ  Id. (quoting \nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481 (1986)).  โTo qualify as a โfinal \npolicymaking official,โ a municipal official must have the responsibility and authority to \nimplement final municipal policy with respect to a particular court of action.โ  Id. \n(quoting Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 482โ83).  Policymaking authority implies authority to set \nand implement general goals and programs of municipal government, as opposed to \ndiscretionary authority in purely operation aspects of government.  Spell v. McDaniel, \n824 F.2d 1380, 1386 (4th Cir. 1987).  โThe focus on final policymaking authority has \nlong been recognized as a vital inquiry in determining a municipalityโs liability under \nยง 1983, for it distinguishes โacts of the municipality from acts of employees of the \nmunicipality.โโ  Washington v. Balt. Police Depโt, 457 F. Supp. 3d 520, 537 (D. Md. \n2020) (first citing Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 479; and then citing City of St. Louis v. \nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 127 (1988)).   \nThe question of who possesses final policymaking authority is one of state law to \nbe resolved by the trial judge before the case is submitted to jury.  Riddick, 238 F.3d at \n523 (citing Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483); Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737 \n(1989).  In this analysis, courts generally look to โthe relevant legal materials, including \n14 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 15 of 23\nstate and local positive law, โas well as โcustom or usageโ having the force of law.โโ8  \nJett, 491 U.S. at 737 (quoting Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 124 n.1).   \nThough plaintiffs cite to a decision which found an ad hoc policy constituted a \nmunicipal policy when implemented by an authorized municipal official, plaintiffs fail to \nidentify a single person who implemented the โpolicyโ or โpracticeโ at issue in this case.  \nSee ECF No. 118 at 6.  Additionally, plaintiffs fail to explain how that unidentified \nperson possesses final policymaking authority under South Carolina law.  See id.  In \ncontrast, Beaufort County first argues that plaintiffs have not identified any final \npolicymakerโs decision that prompted the strip-search practice.  ECF No. 116 at 10.  \nHowever, even if plaintiffs were to argue that Director Grant had such authority, Beaufort \nCounty claims that Director Grant was not a final policymaker under South Carolina state \nlaw because she was an employee and not an elected officeholder.9  Id. at 11โ12.   \nAt the hearing, Beaufort County explained that county council was the final \npolicymaker but that it had delegated its policymaking authority to the county \nadministrator, whereas it had delegated the operational authority of the BCDC to Director \nGrant.  ECF No. 128.  Additionally, the parties agreed that Director Grant, through her \n \n8 โPositive law typically consists of enacted lawโthe codes, statutes, and \nregulations that are applied and enforced in the courts.  The term derives from the \nmedieval use of positum (Latin โestablishedโ), so that the phrase positive law literally \nmeans law established by human authority.โ  Blackโs Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024).  \nThe Fourth Circuit has implied that positive law encompasses not only legislative or \nexecutive enactment but also common law.  See Worm v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 5 F.3d \n744, 748 (4th Cir. 1993).  The nuances of that distinction are irrelevant for the instant \ninquiry before the court.   \n9 Plaintiffs fail to make any argument under the appropriate standard as to a final \npolicymaker decision.  See ECF No. 118 at 6.  Therefore, the court need not delve into \nthe intricacies of the Beaufort County administration, though Beaufort County provides \nsuch a summary in its brief.  See ECF No. 116 at 12.   \n15 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 16 of 23\nDeputy Director, implemented the policy after consultation with the then-county attorney.  \nId.; see also ECF No. 103-1, Grant Aff. ยถ 50.  Plaintiffs do not contend that Director \nGrant is a final policymaker for Beaufort County in their briefs, though they implied as \nmuch at the hearing.  See ECF Nos. 118 at 6; 128.   \nAs such, the court denies the motion for partial summary judgment to the extent it \nclaims that an unconstitutional policy or custom was established by the decision of a final \npolicymaker because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to who made the decision \nregarding the practice and a question of law of whether that person had final \npolicymaking authority.  Should plaintiffs pursue the second Monell theory to establish \nliability at trial, the court will resolve the latter question of law before the case goes to the \njury.  See Riddick, 238 F.3d at 523. \n3.  Omission that Manifests Deliberate Indifference to the Rights of \nCitizens \nA plaintiff can establish liability by demonstrating a deficient program of police \ntraining and supervision that results in a constitutional violation committed by untrained \nor improperly trained officers.  Spell, 824 F.2d at 1387โ89.  โSection 1983 liability may \nattach if officers are not adequately trained โin relation to the tasks the particular officers \nmust perform,โ and this deficiency is โclosely related to the ultimate injury.โโ  Lytle, 326 \nF.3d at 473 (quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 390โ91).  To establish such an omission, \nplaintiffs must provide โevidence that additional trainingโ would have resulted in the \nofficers responding differently.  Id. at 473โ74.  Moreover, โa failure to train can only \nform a basis for liability if โit can be shown that policymakers were aware of, and \nacquiesced in, a pattern of constitutional violations.โโ  Id. at 474 (quoting Canton, 489 \nU.S. at 397 (OโConnor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).   \n16 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 17 of 23\nWhile establishing a custom or policy of failure to train normally requires a \npattern of constitutional violations that demonstrated to the municipality the need for \nbetter or different training, the Supreme Court has suggested that liability of a \nmunicipality for failure to train could be based on a single incident where the need for \ntraining was obvious.  Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10 (explaining that the need to train \nofficers on the constitutional limitations of the use of deadly force is obvious when those \nofficers are directed to arrest fleeing felons and provided firearms for that task).  \nHowever, โa single incident is almost never enough to warrant municipal liability.โ  Est. \nof Jones v. City of Martinsburg, 961 F.3d 661, 672 (4th Cir. 2020).   \nPlaintiffs do not claim that an omission or Beaufort Countyโs failure to train its \ncorrectional officers and employees caused the alleged constitutional violation in this \ncase.  See ECF No. 118 at 6โ8.  Beaufort County identifies that โ[p]laintiffs have not \npresented, and cannot present, any evidence of an omission in training that specifically \ncaused the alleged constitutional violations.โ  ECF No. 116 at 15.  The court agrees and \nfinds that plaintiffs have not adequately shown there is no genuine dispute of material \nfact as to this theory of municipal liability.   \n4.  Persistent and Widespread Policy that Constitutes a Custom or \nUsage with the Force of Law \nโCustom, or usageโ may serve as a basis for imposing municipal liability, where \nthe existence of that custom or usage is illustrated by โpersistent and \nwidespread . . . practices of municipal officers which although not authorized by written \nlaw, are so permanent and well-settled as to have the force of law.โ  Spell, 824 F.2d at \n1386 (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 690โ91) (cleaned up).  A plaintiff can demonstrate this \nfourth Monell theory by identifying an โirresponsible failure by municipal policymakers \n17 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 18 of 23\nto put a stop to or correct a widespread pattern of unconstitutional conduct by police \nofficers of which the specific violation is simply an example.โ  Id. at 1387โ89. โA \nmunicipality is not liable for mere โisolated incidents of unconstitutional conduct by \nsubordinate employees . . . .  Rather, there must be numerous particular instances of \nunconstitutional conduct in order to establish a custom or practice.โโ  Smith v. Ray, 409 \nF. Appโx 641, 650 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Lytle, 326 F.3d at 473).  This fourth theory of \nliability is commonly referred to as a โcondonation theoryโ of liability.  See Lilly v. Balt. \nPolice Depโt, 694 F. Supp. 3d 569, 589 (D. Md. 2023).   \nPlaintiffs allege that Beaufort County maintained a custom, policy, and/or practice \nof strip searching every female pre-trial detainee at BCDC.  ECF No. 93-1 at 2โ3.  \nPlaintiffs therefore allege a theory of custom โby condonation.โ  See Owens v. Balt. City \nStateโs Attโys Off., 767 F.3d 379, 402 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Spell, 824 F.2d at 1390); \nsee also Lytle, 326 F.3d at 471.  โUnder this theory of liability, a city violates ยง 1983 if \nmunicipal policymakers fail โto put a stop to or to correct a widespread pattern of \nunconstitutional conduct.โโ  Owens, 767 F.3d at 402 (quoting Spell, 824 F.2d at 1389).  \nTo prevail under such a theory, a plaintiff must point to a โpersistent and widespread \npractice[] of municipal officials,โ the โduration and frequencyโ of which indicate that \npolicymakers (1) had actual or constructive knowledge of the conduct and (2) failed to \ncorrect it due to their โdeliberate indifference.โ  Spell, 824 F.2d at 1386โ91 (alterations \nomitted).  Actual knowledge may be evidenced by recorded reports to or discussions by a \nmunicipal governing body.  Id. at 1387.  Constructive knowledge may be evidenced by \nthe fact that the practices have been so widespread or flagrant that in the proper exercise \nof its official responsibilities the governing body should have known of them.  Id.  Both \n18 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 19 of 23\nknowledge and indifference can be inferred from the โextentโ of employeesโ misconduct.  \nId. at 1391.  Sporadic or isolated violations of rights will not give rise to Monell liability; \nonly โwidespread or flagrantโ violations will.  Id. at 1387.  Additionally, โif the custom \ngrew from within the ranks of employees, [plaintiffs] may need to make an additional \nshowing that the municipality knew about the custom and โcondonedโ it.โ  Greensboro \nPro. Fire Fighters Assโn, Loc. 3157 v. City of Greensboro, 64 F.3d 962, 966 (4th Cir. \n1995).   \nPlaintiffs agree that no municipality can be held liable under ยง 1983 on a \nrespondeat superior theory.  See ECF No. 118 at 7.  โA plaintiffโs theory is most likely to \nslip into that forbidden realm when she alleges municipal omissionโeither a policy of \ndeliberate indifference or the condonation of an unconstitutional custom.โ  Carter, 164 \nF.3d at 218 (citing Bd. of Cnty. Commโrs., 520 U.S. at 405).  โWhere a plaintiff claims \nthat the municipality has not directly inflicted an injury, but nonetheless has caused an \nemployee to do so, rigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied to \nensure that the municipality is not held liable solely for the actions of its employee.โ  Bd. \nof Cnty. Commโrs, 520 U.S. at 405.  Thus, โmunicipal liability will attach only for those \npolicies or customs having a โspecific deficiency or deficiencies . . . such as to make the \nspecific violation almost bound to happen, sooner or later, rather than merely likely to \nhappy in the long run.โโ  Carter, 164 F.3d at 218 (quoting Spell, 824 F.2d at 1390). \nPlaintiffs allege that the unlawful practice of strip-searching female detaineesโ\nbut not similarly situated male detaineesโโlasted over five years and included thousands \nof constitutional violations.โ  ECF No. 118 at 6.  In other words, plaintiffs โdo not rely on \nepisodic exercises of discretion,โ but rather โa widespread and pervasive practice.โ  Id. at \n19 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 20 of 23\n7.  This practice was BCDCโs โunequal practice of conducting a strip search on every \nfemale pre-classification detainee awaiting bond between February 27, 2015, and May 5, \n2020, but not on every mail pre-classification detainee.โ  Id.  Plaintiffs imply that this \nduration and frequency warrants โa finding of either actual or constructive knowledge by \nthe municipal governing body that the [strip-searching] practice[] ha[s] become \ncustomary among its employee.โ  Id. at 7 n.8.  Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the \ncourt should find constructive knowledgeโwhere the practice was so widespread or \nflagrant that in the proper exercise of its official responsibilities the governing body \nshould have known of themโsuch that the custom or usage may be fairly attributed to \nBeaufort County on its own.  Id.  Finally, plaintiffs allege that this practice โwas the \nmoving force and proximate causeโ of the violations of plaintiffsโ equal protection rights.  \nId. at 8.   \nBeaufort County emphasizes that plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that \nthe responsible policymakers for Beaufort County ever had actual or constructive \nknowledge of the strip-searching practice.  ECF No. 116 at 16.  It further identifies those \npolicymakers to be the County Council and the County Administrator.  Id.  It specifies \nthat the plaintiffs fail to identify legal actions challenging the practice, complaints about \nthe practice, or any other information that could have put the appropriate county \npolicymaker on notice.  Id. at 16โ17.  However, at the hearing, counsel for Beaufort \nCounty conceded that because Director Grant consulted with the county attorney, \nBeaufort County likely had actual notice if not constructive notice of the strip-searching \npractice.  ECF No. 128.   \n20 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 21 of 23\nIn essence, both parties agree that there is no genuine issue of material fact that \nthe alleged searches were a widespread and pervasive practice that occurred over a five-\nyear span of time.  See ECF Nos. 118 at 6โ8; 116 at 16โ17; cf. Carter, 164 F.3d at 220 \n(concluding that the โmeager history of isolated incidentsโ did not approach the \nโโwidespread and permanentโ practice necessary to establish municipal customโ).   \nThe parties dispute whether the final elementโthat the policymakers failed to \ncorrect the unconstitutional custom due to their โdeliberate indifferenceโโis met.  Spell, \n824 F.2d at 1386โ91.  On the one hand, at the hearing, Beaufort County emphasized that \nthere is a genuine dispute of material fact as to deliberate indifference because of the \nmany other considerations that may have led to their failure to address the practice.  ECF \nNo. 128.  For example, at that time the constitutional right was not clearly established, \nthe policymakers had to abide by state laws separating male and female detainees, and \nBCDC was dealing with an issue of overcrowding that only affected male inmates.  Id.  \nEach of these purportedly led the relevant decisionmakers to house male and female pre-\nclassification detainees differently.  Id.  In contrast, plaintiffs appear to argue in a \nfootnote that the practice was so severe and pervasive that some unidentified county \npolicymaker should have been on notice as to the practice and he or she were thereafter \ndeliberately indifferent to the inequal treatment of male and female pre-classification \ndetainees at BCDC.  ECF No. 118 at 7 n.8.   \nThe court finds that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether \nBeaufort Countyโs failure to correct the strip-search practice reflects deliberate \nindifference.  As such, the court finds that genuine disputes over material facts remain as \n21 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 22 of 23\nto whether a policy or customโas defined by Monellโ exists in this case such that the \ncourt denies the partial motion for summary judgment as to municipal liability.10   \nB.  Motion to Strike \nPlaintiffs filed a motion to strike the late-filed affidavits from Director Grant, \nECF No. 123, and expert witness Sean Stewart, ECF No. 124.  ECF No. 125.  Plaintiffs \nspecify they bring a motion to strike pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).  Id. at 3.  The \naffidavits are both irrelevant to the issue of municipal liability, which is the sole issue \nbefore the court in the partial motion for summary judgment.  See ECF Nos. 93; 123; \n124.  Consequently, the court denies plaintiffsโ motion to strike.  Should the parties \nobject to the entry of evidence at the forthcoming jury trial, they may raise those \nobjections pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil \n \n10 To reiterate, beyond identifying one of the four Monell theories, the plaintiff \nmust also demonstrate that, through the countyโs deliberate conduct, it was the โmoving \nforceโ behind the injury alleged.  See Bd. of Cnty. Commโrs., 520 U.S. at 404 (1997); \nFranklin v. City of Charlotte, 64 F.4th 519, 536 (4th Cir. 2023) (explaining that plaintiffs \nmust establish that the municipal policy or custom โcaused the alleged constitutional \ninjuryโ).  When a municipal policy or custom is itself unconstitutional (i.e., when it \ndirectly commands or authorizes constitutional violations) the causal connection between \npolicy and violation is manifest and does not require independent proof.  Spell, 824 F.2d \nat 1387.  โBut a policy or custom that is not itself unconstitutional in this strict sense must \nbe independently proven to have caused the violation.โ  Id. at 1387โ88.  โProof merely \nthat such a policy or custom was โlikelyโ to cause a particular violation is not sufficient; \nthere must be proven at least an โaffirmative linkโ between policy or custom and \nviolation.โ  Id. at 1388.  Stated in tort principle terms, โthe causal connection must be \nโproximateโ not merely โbut-forโ causation-in-fact.โ  Id. (quoting City of Okla. City v. \nTuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823 (1985)).   \nNeither party extensively briefed this final step.  However, the unconstitutional \nโcustomโ entailed strip searching female pre-classification detainees, but not strip \nsearching similarly situated male pre-classification detainees.  This is unconstitutional on \nits face because it treats males and females differently on the face of the implemented \npractice.  See, e.g., Monell, 436 U.S. at 661 (mandatory pregnancy leave policy); Tuttle, \n471 U.S. at 822โ23 (noting that no additional causal evidence was required when the \npolicy in and of itself violated constitutional rights and when the municipality exercised \nthat policy).  Therefore, it is likely that the causal connection is manifest.   \n22 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/21/24    Entry Number 129     Page 23 of 23\nProcedure either at trial or in a motion in limine timely filed in accordance with the \nscheduling order.    \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES the motion for partial summary \njudgment and DENIES the motion to strike.   \n  AND IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \nDAVID C.

This action concerns the manner in which inmates are searched at the Beaufort\nO\nN\n P\nCounty Detention Center in Beaufort, South Carolina, and alleges, among other things, violations  L\nE\nA\nS\nof the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and their   -\n C\nA\nS\ncorollaries under the South Carolina Constitution.    E\n#\n2\n0\n2. The main issue raised by this action is the equal protection rights of women whom 2\n0\nC\nP\n0\nthe Beaufort County Detention Center routinely subject to humiliating strip and body cavity  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nsearches in violation of the Constitutions and laws of the United States and State of South Carolina.  4\n3. A specific concern is that female inmates at the Beaufort County Detention Center\nare subjected to degrading and unnecessary strip and body cavity searches under circumstances \nand conditions when male inmates are not.  \n4. The  named  Plaintiffs,  Cheryl  A.  Munday  (โMundayโ)  and  Margaret  Devine\n(โDevineโ) seek to represent a class of all women who have been admitted to the Beaufort County \nDetention Center while waiting for bail to be set or for an initial court appearance, women who \n-2 -\n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 3 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nhave been arrested on default warrants and held in the Beaufort County Detention Center, and  N\nIC\nA\nL\nwomen who have been held in protective custody in the Beaufort County Detention Center.   L\nY\n F\nIncluded in this proposed class are women who have been taken into custody by Beaufort County  IL\nE\nD\n -\nSheriffโs Office and other local law enforcement agencies in Beaufort County, South Carolina, and   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nthen transported to the Beaufort County Detention Center.  These women have all been unlawfully \na\nr\n 0\n6\nsubjected to routine strip searches, including degrading visual body cavity searches of their anuses   2\n:1\n7\n P\nand vaginas.   \nM\n -\n B\n5.  Plaintiffโs claims arise out of acts of the Beaufort County Detention Center in the  E\nA\nU\nF\nCounty of Beaufort, State of South Carolina.  Venue is therefore proper in Beaufort County.    O\nR\nT\n -\nPARTIES   C\nO\nM\nM\n6.  Plaintiffs are female residents of Beaufort County, South Carolina.  \nO\nN\n P\n7.  Defendant Beaufort County (โCountyโ) is a political subdivision of the State of  L\nE\nA\nS\nSouth Carolina and owns and operates the Beaufort County Detention Center (โBCDCโ).  County   -\n C\nA\nS\nis responsible for BCDC policies, practices, and/or customs which caused Plaintiffsโ injuries in  E\n#\n2\n0\nviolation of one or more federal constitutional guarantees.  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\n8.  Defendant Philip Foot (โFootโ) is a citizen and resident of Beaufort County, South  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nCarolina, and is Assistant County Administrator for Public Safety Division who oversees BCDC.  4\nFoot is sued in his individual and official capacities.  \n9.  Defendant Quandara Grant (โGrantโ) is a citizen and resident of Beaufort County, \nSouth Carolina, and is the director of BCDC.  Grant is sued in her individual and official capacities.  \n10.  Defendants John Does 1-5 (collectively, โBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ) were \nand are now responsible for the training, supervision, control, assignment, and discipline of both \nsworn and civilian personnel of the County who work in, operate, administer, and manage BCDC, \n- 3 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 4 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nand for the formulation, promulgation, adoption, application, administration, and enforcement of  N\nIC\nA\nL\nthe policies, rules, regulations, and practices of BCDC.  At this time, Plaintiffs do not know the  L\nY\n F\nidentities and capacities of the BCDC Supervisory Defendants and therefore sue these Defendants  IL\nE\nD\n -\nby fictitious names.  Plaintiffs will seek to amend this Complaint to include one of more of the   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ true names and capacities when ascertained.    \na\nr\n 0\n6\n11.  Defendants Jane Does 1-5 (collectively, โBCDC Officer Defendantsโ) were at all   2\n:1\n7\n P\ntimes relevant herein employees of the County who worked as correctional officers at BCDC.  At \nM\n -\n B\nthis time, Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the BCDC Officer Defendants and therefore sue  E\nA\nU\nF\nthese Defendants by fictitious names.  Plaintiffs will seek to amend this Complaint to include one  O\nR\nT\n -\nof more of the BCDC Officer Defendantsโ true names when ascertained.   C\nO\nM\nM\n12.  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant herein, the BCDC Supervisory \nO\nN\n P\nDefendants and the BCDC Officer Defendants participated in, approved, and/or ratified the  L\nE\nA\nS\nunconstitutional or illegal acts that occurred within BCDC which are complained of herein.    -\n C\nA\nS\n13.  At all times relevant herein, the individual Defendants were the agents, servants,  E\n#\n2\n0\nand employees of the County and either were acting within the scope of their agency and  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\nemployment with the knowledge and consent of the County or, alternatively, were acting in their  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nindividual capacities.  Plaintiffs plead this in the alternative because, until further discovery is  4\nconducted on this topic (including issues of applicable policies and procedures, notice and \nknowledge, and ratification), they cannot allege these facts with certainty.   \n14.  At all times herein, Defendants were acting under the color of state law.   \nCLAIMS OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES  \nCheryl Munday \n- 4 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 5 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\n15.  Munday was arrested by the Bluffton Police Department on or about March 9, 2018,  N\nIC\nA\nL\nand accused of driving under the influence, a charge that was later dismissed.  Her arresting officer  L\nY\n F\ndelivered her to the BCDC and into the custody of one or more BCDC Officer Defendants to begin  IL\nE\nD\n -\nthe booking process.     2\n0\n2\n0\n M\n16.  At the onset of the booking process, one of the BCDC Officer Defendants reviewed \na\nr\n 0\n6\nMundayโs personal information and commented, โyou look great.โ  The comment, made to the   2\n:1\n7\n P\ndismay of a nearby supervising officer who was also a BCDC Officer Defendant, was about \nM\n -\n B\nMundayโs physical appearance considering her age.  The officerโs inappropriate comment was  E\nA\nU\nF\nannounced just prior to Plaintiff being informed that she was subject to a full body โpat down.โ   O\nR\nT\n -\n17.  A BCDC Officer Defendant then initiated a full body pat down procedure while   C\nO\nM\nM\nMundayโs clothing remained on.  The officer placed her hands on Mundayโs ankles and worked \nO\nN\n P\nher way up the legs.   The officer grabbed Mundayโs crotch with great force, and slowly ran a  L\nE\nA\nS\nfinger along Mundayโs vaginal area.  The officer inserted a finger into Mundayโs vagina as far as   -\n C\nA\nS\nit would go until clothing prevented it from going further.  The pat down continued to Mundayโs  E\n#\n2\n0\nupper body where the officer attempted to insert her hands under Mundayโs bra.    2\n0\nC\nP\n0\n18.  Next, Munday was taken to a small area known as the โstrip-search roomโ and  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nrequired to remove her clothing.  While nude, Munday was required to bend over, manually spread  4\nher buttocks and ordered to cough.  Munday complied but was asked to repeat the humiliating \nprocedure several times.  For some unknown reason, the BCDC Officer Defendant requiring her \nto do so became angry and started shouting.  Throughout the duration of the humiliating search, \nthe door remained open so that any passersby could peer in and see Mundayโs naked body while \nbending over.   \n- 5 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 6 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\n19.  Munday was led back to the main lobby where she witnessed a male arrestee being  N\nIC\nA\nL\nbooked in.   The male arrestee was patted from the knees down only.  The officer did not search  L\nY\n F\nthe manโs groin or buttocks.  The man was not strip-searched like females were.  He was handed  IL\nE\nD\n -\njail clothing and directed to change in an adjacent room.      2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nMargaret Devine \na\nr\n 0\n6\n20.  Devine was arrested by the South Carolina Highway Patrol on or about January 17,   2\n:1\n7\n P\n2019, and accused of driving under the influence, a charge that was later dismissed.  She was \nM\n -\n B\ntransported to BCDC and into the custody of one or more BCDC Officer Defendants to begin the  E\nA\nU\nF\nbooking process.    O\nR\nT\n -\n21.  Devineโs personal belongings were confiscated including her purse, wallet, jewelry,   C\nO\nM\nM\ncell phone and cash.  A BCDC officer then initiated a full body pat down while Devineโs clothing \nO\nN\n P\nremained on.    L\nE\nA\nS\n22.  Devine was led to a shower stall and required to remove her clothing.  The shower   -\n C\nA\nS\nstall was open so that passers-by were able to see in.  Once Devine was nude, two BCDC guards  E\n#\n2\n0\ninstructed her to turn around, face a wall and bend over from the waist so that her backside and  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\ngenitalia were fully exposed.  Devine was ordered to cough.   7\n0\n0\n6\n0\n23.  Devine was humiliated but complied.  Despite her compliance, the officers ordered  4\nher to โcough harder and louder.โ  She again complied.  Then, she was ordered to take a shower \nwhile the guards watched.   \n24.  The BCDC guards were again dissatisfied and required Devine to shower again, \nthis time making sure to wet her hair completely.  Devine was humiliated, demeaned and \ndemoralized.   \n \n- 6 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 7 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\n  N\nIC\nA\nL\n  L\nY\n F\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  ILE\nD\n -\nA.  Common Factual Allegations   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\n25.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip-searched and \na\nr\n 0\n6\nforced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when booked into   2\n:1\n7\n P\nBCDC.  \nM\n -\n B\n26.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip-searched and  E\nA\nU\nF\nforced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when they are first  O\nR\nT\n -\nplaced in general population.    C\nO\nM\nM\n27.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip-searched and \nO\nN\n P\nforced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when they are  L\nE\nA\nS\nbooked into BCDC.    -\n C\nA\nS\n28.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip-searched and  E\n#\n2\n0\nforced to undergo visual body cavity searches, in the manner described above, when they are first  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\nplaced in general population.   7\n0\n0\n6\n0\n29.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege the strip and/or visual body cavity  4\nsearches to which Plaintiffs and class members were subjected were performed pursuant to \nDefendantsโ policy and practice to indiscriminately search all or a large number of women but not \nmen being processed into the jail without regard to: (a) The nature of their offense or criminal \nhistory; (b) Whether they are under an order of release; (c) Whether they have had contact with \nany persons from outside BCDC who could reasonably be believed to be a potential source of \ncontraband or weapons; (d)  Whether there is a reason of any kind to believe they are a potential \n- 7 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 8 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nsource of contraband or weapons; (e) Whether there is any other articulable justification for  N\nIC\nA\nL\nDefendantsโ indiscriminate strip and body search policy; and (f) Whether there is any legitimate  L\nY\n F\nreason to strip-search women but not men, as set forth herein.   IL\nE\nD\n -\n30.  On information and belief, Defendants have a policy of not limiting to those who   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nare necessary for the procedure the persons who can see, hear, or observe all or part of the strip \na\nr\n 0\n6\nand body cavity searches. Thus, other officers or jail employees, members of the opposite sex,   2\n:1\n7\n P\ndispensable jail personnel, and possibly others are able to see, hear, or observe some or all of the \nM\n -\n B\nsearches described above.  Specifically, class members are required to submit to strip-searches  E\nA\nU\nF\nduring which other people who are not participating in the same and/or are of the opposite sex,  O\nR\nT\n -\nincluding jail staff, are able to observe the search and the class membersโ naked bodies.   C\nO\nM\nM\n31.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalves, and on behalf of a class of all \nO\nN\n P\nother persons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil  L\nE\nA\nS\nProcedure.  The class is defined as those women who were forced to undergo the unlawful strip   -\n C\nA\nS\nand/or visual body cavity searches at BCDC which are operated, maintained, and under the control  E\n#\n2\n0\nof Beaufort County as set forth in this Complaint; to wit, searches that violated the Fourth  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\nAmendment or its South Carolina equivalent or searches that violated the equal protection of the  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nlaw due to the fact that the policy and custom of strip-searches was applied to women, but not to  4\nmen.   \nB.  Rule 23 Prerequisites \ni.  Numerosity \n32.  In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), the members of \nthe class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Plaintiffs do not know the \nexact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon alleges, that there \n- 8 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 9 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nare hundreds, perhaps thousands, who were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches as a  N\nIC\nA\nL\nresult of Defendantsโ policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting prisoners to strip and body  L\nY\n F\ncavity searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the numbers of  IL\nE\nD\n -\npersons in the proposed class is in the hundreds or thousands.     2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nii.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that \nM\n -\n B\nthe commons questions of fact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether BCDC  E\nA\nU\nF\nroutinely subjects all prisoners to strip and/or body cavity searches without any reasonable  O\nR\nT\n -\nsuspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular inmate has concealed   C\nO\nM\nM\ndrugs, weapons, and/or any contraband on her person or in her body cavities; (2) Whether the strip \nO\nN\n P\nand/or body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the search cannot be  L\nE\nA\nS\nobserved by persons not participating in the search or whether the strip and body cavity searches   -\n C\nA\nS\nare conducted in areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches;  E\n#\n2\n0\n(3) Whether females are subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches when males are not; and  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\n(4) Whether females are subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under conditions which are  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nmore intrusive than males.  4\n34.  In  accordance  with  South  Carolina  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a),  there  are \nquestions of law common to the class.

Typicality L\nE\nA\nS\n35. In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), the claims of the  -\n C\nA\nS\nrepresentative Plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Class Plaintiffs were in BCDC custody when they  E\n#\n2\n0\nwere subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates without any reasonable suspicion  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\nbased on specific or articulable facts to believe that they had concealed drugs, weapons, and/or  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\ncontraband in their body cavities; Class Plaintiffs were subjected to the searches in open areas  4\nwhere others could observe who were not involved in the search, including members of the \nopposite sex; Class Plaintiffs were forced to stand naked in unsanitary areas; and females were \nsubjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under conditions which were more intrusive and less \nsanitary than males.  \n36.  Thus, Plaintiffs Munday and Devine have the same interests and has suffered the \nsame type of damages as the class members.  Plaintiffsโ claims are based upon the same or similar \n- 10 -\n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 11 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nlegal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each class member suffered actual damages as  N\nIC\nA\nL\na result of being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity search.  The actual damages suffered by  L\nY\n F\nPlaintiffs are similar in type to the actual damages suffered by each class member.   IL\nE\nD\n -\n37.  In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), Munday and   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nDevine, as the representative Plaintiffs, will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \na\nr\n 0\n6\nTheir interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   2\n:1\n7\n P\niv.   Maintenance and Superiority  M\n -\n B\n38.  In  accordance  with  South  Carolina  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(1)(A),  E\nA\nU\nF\nprosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that  O\nR\nT\n -\ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would   C\nO\nM\nM\nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \nO\nN\n P\n39.  In  accordance  with  South  Carolina  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(1)(B),  L\nE\nA\nS\nprosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of   -\n C\nA\nS\nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter,  E\n#\n2\n0\nsubstantially impair or impeded the interests of the other members of the class to protect their  2\n0\nC\nP\n0\ninterests.    7\n0\n0\n6\n0\n40.  In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs are  4\ninformed and believe, and thereon allege, that Defendants have acted on grounds generally \napplicable to the class.  \n41.  In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), the questions \nof law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members and this class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, \n- 11 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 12 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nand thereon allege, that the interests of class members in individually controlling the prosecution  N\nIC\nA\nL\nof a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable to individually prosecute  L\nY\n F\nany action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the amounts at stake  IL\nE\nD\n -\nfor individuals are such that separate suits would be impracticable in that most members of the   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nclass will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \na\nr\n 0\n6\nthereon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims   2\n:1\n7\n P\narise in the same location.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of \nM\n -\n B\nlaw and fact in one forum rather than in multiple courts.   E\nA\nU\nF\n42.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed  O\nR\nT\n -\nand believe, and thereon allege, that the identities of the class members are ascertainable from   C\nO\nM\nM\nBCDC records, in particular the computer system used to track and identify BCDC inmates.  \nO\nN\n P\nPlaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Defendants possess the identities,  L\nE\nA\nS\nincluding addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody at   -\n C\nA\nS\nBCDC; when inmates were arrested and booked, taken to court, and returned from court; why  E\n#\n2\n0\ninmates were released; and when inmates were released.   2\n0\nC\nP\n0\n43.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of this  7\n0\n0\n6\n0\nlitigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any  4\nother available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class.  The class action will be \nmanageable because so many different records systems exist from which to ascertain the members \nof the class.  Liability can be determined on a class-wide basis.   \n44.  In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), class members \nmust be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual \nnotice to all members who can be identified through reasonable efforts.  Plaintiffs are informed \n- 12 - \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 06/05/20      Entry Number 1-1       Page 13 of 37\nE\nL\nE\nC\nT\nR\nO\nand believe that BCDC computer records contain a last known address for class members.

Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of the  IL\nE\nD\n -\nfollowing:   2\n0\n2\n0\n M\nA.

For the reasons set \nforth below, the court denies the motion.   \nI.   BACKGROUND \nBecause the parties are well acquainted with this litigation, the court will only \nbriefly summarize material facts for the purpose of aiding an understanding of the courtโs \nlegal analysis. \n1 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 2 of 10\nThis matter arises from certain procedures in place at the Beaufort County \nDetention Center1 (โBCDCโ) that are used for female pre-classification detainees.2  Once \na pre-trial detainee goes to a bond hearing and cannot post a bond, upon returning to \nBCDC, he or she is then classified to a different area at BCDC, such as in general \npopulation or, depending on the inmateโs behavior, maximum or super maximum \nsecurity.  ECF No. 34-3 at 21:3โ18.  On February 27, 2015, BCDC adopted a policy (the \nโpolicyโ) that all inmates moved from pre-classification to other areas of BCDC, \nincluding general population, would be strip searched.3  See ECF No. 31-4 at 2.  BCDCโs \npractice (the โpracticeโ) has been to house female pre-classification inmates in general \npopulation while placing male pre-classification inmates in a separate pre-classification \ncell outside of general population.  ECF No. 31-3 at 14, Black Dep. 24:2โ20.  Because \nfemale pre-classification inmates are housed in general population from the outset, the \npractice resulted in BCDC conducting a strip search on every female pre-classification \ndetainee awaiting a bond hearing.  ECF No. 40-1 ยถ 6.  BCDC, however, did not do so for \nsimilarly situated male pre-classification detainees prior to May 5, 2020, because they \nwere housed in a separate pre-classification cell outside of general population.   \nThe two named plaintiffs in this case, Cheryl Munday (โMundayโ) and Margaret \nDevine (โDevineโ) (together, โplaintiffsโ), allege they were impacted by this practice.  \n \n1 Defendant Beaufort County operates BCDC. ECF Nos. 12 ยถ 7, 13 ยถ 5.   \n2 A pre-classification detainee is an inmate who has been arrested and placed or \nhoused in an area at the detention center prior to going to a bond hearing.  ECF No. 34-1 \nat 20:7โ14.   \n3 This policy of strip searching all inmates moved from pre-classification to other \nareas of the facility, including general population, was established in a memorandum (the \nโAllen Memorandumโ) from Deputy Director C.E. Allen published on February 27, \n2015.  See ECF No. 40-1 ยถ 6, Grant Aff.  \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 3 of 10\nSpecifically, each of them describes being arrested for driving under the influence (each \nhad that charge later dismissed), brought into BCDC for holding, and subjected to a \npublic strip search and visual body cavity searchโall while similarly situated men were \nnot subjected to such a search.   \nPlaintiffs filed the instant case on March 6, 2020, in the Beaufort County Court of \nCommon Pleas on behalf of themselves and a class of all similarly situated women who \nwere subjected to the practice and the policy.4  ECF No. 1-1, Compl.  On June 5, 2020, \nBeaufort County removed the case to federal court.  ECF No. 1.  This case was referred \nto Magistrate Judge Molly Cherry for all pretrial proceedings pursuant to the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g) (D.S.C.).  On \nAugust 5, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, now the operative complaint.  \nECF No. 12, Amend. Compl.  The plaintiffs brought various state and federal claims \nagainst Beaufort County, Assistant County Administrator for the Public Safety Division \nPhilip Foot (โFootโ), Director of the BCDC Colonel Quandara Grant (โDirector Grantโ), \nJohn Does 1โ5 (described as โBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ), and Jane Does 1-5 \n(described as โBCDC Officer Defendantsโ) (collectively, โdefendantsโ).  Amend. Compl. \nยถยถ 7โ11. \nOn May 2, 2022, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  ECF No. 48.  \nOn October 28, 2022, Magistrate Judge Cherry issued the R&R which recommended the \n \n4 Specifically, the class is defined as โall women who have been admitted to the \nBeaufort County Detention Center while waiting for bail to be set or for an initial court \nappearance, women who have been arrested on default warrants and held in the Beaufort \nCounty Detention Center, and women who have been held in protective custody in the \nBeaufort County Detention Center. . . . These women have all been unlawfully subjected \nto routine strip searches, including degrading visual body cavity searches of their anuses \nand vaginas.โ  Compl. ยถ 4.   \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 4 of 10\nmotion for summary judgment be granted in part and denied in part and recommended \nthat plaintiffsโ request to amend their amended complaint to name new defendants be \ndenied.  ECF No. 76, R&R.  On March 27, 2023, the court adopted in part and rejected in \npart the R&R which, in turn, granted in part and denied in part Beaufort Countyโs motion \nfor summary judgment.  ECF No. 82.  On April 24, 2023, Beaufort County filed a motion \nfor reconsideration.  ECF No. 87.  Plaintiffs responded in opposition on May 5, 2023, \nECF No. 89, to which Beaufort County replied on May 12, 2023, ECF No. 90.  As such, \nthe motion has been fully briefed and it is now ripe for review.   \nII.   STANDARD \nA.  Motion to Alter or Amend \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) allows a party to file a motion to alter or \namend a judgment.  The rule provides an โextraordinary remedy which should be used \nsparingly.โ  Pac. Ins. Co. v. Am. Natโl Fire Ins. Co., 148 F.3d 396, 403 (4th Cir. 1998) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Fourth Circuit recognizes โonly \nthree limited grounds for a district courtโs grant of a motion under Rule 59(e): (1) to \naccommodate an intervening change in controlling law; (2) to account for new evidence \nnot available earlier; or (3) to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.โ  \nWilder v. McCabe, 2012 WL 1565631, at *1 (D.S.C. May 2, 2012) (citing Hutchinson v. \nStaton, 994 F.2d 1076 (4th Cir. 1993)).  To qualify for reconsideration under the third \nexception, an order cannot merely be โmaybe or probablyโ wrong; it must be โdead \nwrong,โ so as to strike the court โwith the force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated dead \nfish.โ  TFWS, Inc. v. Franchot, 572 F.3d 186, 194 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Bellsouth \nTelesensor v. Info. Sys. & Networks Corp., 1995 WL 520978, at *5 n.6 (4th Cir. 1995) \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 5 of 10\n(unpublished)).  โA partyโs mere disagreement with the courtโs ruling does not warrant a \nRule 59(e) motion, and such motion should not be used to โrehashโ arguments previously \npresented or to submit evidence which should have been previously submitted.โ  \nConsulting Engโrs, Inc. v. Geometric Software Sols. & Structure Works LLC, 2007 WL \n2021901, at *2 (D.S.C. July 6, 2007).  Ultimately, the decision whether to reconsider an \norder resulting in judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) is within the discretion of the district \ncourt.  See Hughes v. Bedsole, 48 F.3d 1376, 1382 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIII.   DISCUSSION \nThe court granted Beaufort Countyโs motion for summary judgment on Counts 1, \n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 2 (as asserted against individual defendants), but denied Beaufort \nCountyโs motion for summary judgment on Counts 2 (violations of the Equal Protection \nClause pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 brought against Beaufort County) and 10 (attorneysโ \nfees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b)).  ECF No. 82 at 23.  Beaufort County now moves the \ncourt to alter or amend its order, ECF No. 82, to enter summary judgment in favor of \nBeaufort County as to plaintiffsโ equal protection claims brought under ยง 1983 (i.e., \nCounts 2 and 10).  ECF No. 87 at 2.   \nBeaufort County argues that the court committed an error of law when it \nconcluded that the searching of female pre-classification detainees was facially \ndiscriminatory, when the challenged classification was in fact โindisputably facially \nneutral.โ5  Id. at 3โ4.  In support of this contention, it cites to the Allen Memorandum \n \n5 To provide context to this argument, the court notes that according to the Fourth \nCircuit, unequal treatment constituting an equal protection violation โoccurs in one of \ntwo ways: (1) when the government explicitly classifies people based on [a suspect \nclassification], or (2) when a law is facially neutral, but its administration or enforcement \ndisproportionately affects one class of persons over another and a discriminatory intent or \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 6 of 10\nwhich specified that โall inmates moved from pre-classification to other areas of the \nDetention Center (which would include general population) be strip searched.โ  Id. at 4 \n(emphasis in original).  Beaufort County argues that โ[t]he language of the Memorandum \nis, indisputably, gender neutral,โ because it โnever mentions or discusses sex in any \nway.โ  Id. at 5.  Thus, it concludes that โ[t]he challenged conductโsearching all pre-\nclassification female detaineesโis an obvious application of the policies embodied in the \nfacially-neutral Memorandum.โ  Id.  Further, Beaufort County argues that [t]here is no \nevidence that the County made a conscious decision to specifically search women \nbecause of their gender.โ  Id. at 5โ6.  Thus, it contends that โthe Court made a legal error \nin shifting its focus from the facially-neutral search rules to their allegedly gender-\ndiscriminatory impact.โ  Id. at 6 (emphasis in original).  โ[T]he only evidence is that pre-\nclassification female detainees were only search [sic] because of their location,โ and \nโthere is no evidence of any policy, practice, custom, or intention that anyone be searched \nspecifically because of her sex.โ  Id. (emphasis in original).  Beaufort County concludes \nthat โthe Courtโs determination that there is a facially discriminatory classification \ndisregards the requirement of proof of intent.โ  Id. at 7.  The County concedes that its \npractice had an unequal impact on women, but it argues that is not enough because the \nplaintiffs must show disparate impact and discriminatory purpose or intent, which the \nCounty argues that plaintiffs have not adequately shown.  Id. at 8โ9 (citing Flores v. City \n \nanimus is shown.โ  Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, 579 F.3d 380, 388 (4th Cir. 2009).  \nThus, Beaufort County argues that the court improperly applied the first prong when it \nfound an explicit classification on the basis of a protected class, when the appropriate \nstandard of review for the actions in question should have come from the second prong \nwhere the policy was facially neutral but caused a disparate impact.  See ECF No. 87 at \n3โ4.   \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 7 of 10\nof N.Y., 2021 WL 663977, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 19, 2021)).  As such, Beaufort County \nconcludes that the court improperly found the policy and the practice facially \ndiscriminatory when the policy was facially neutral.  Id. at 8โ9. \nIn response, plaintiffs emphasize that the courtโs order denying summary \njudgment on the ยง 1983 claim was correct because Beaufort Countyโs actual practice is \nfacially discriminatory and requires no proof of intent.  ECF No. 89 at 2.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that the Countyโs argument โis like saying that racially segregated bathrooms \ntreated everyone equally, because everyone was prohibited from using the bathroom of a \ndifferent race,โ which is, in essence, asking the court โto ignore the distinction between \npolicy versus practice.โ  Id. at 2โ3.  Plaintiffs go on to claim that โ[i]f the Court adopts \n[Beaufort Countyโs] logic, state actors like BCDC will avoid constitutional liability by \nwhitewashing their written policies even when their actions are facially discriminatory.โ  \nId. at 5 (emphasis in original).   \nIn reply, Beaufort County argues, once more, that the policy at issue is facially \nsex-neutral and, consequently, under a disparate impact analysis plaintiffs โmust create a \ngenuine issue of material fact regarding discriminatory intent to survive summary \njudgment, which they have not done (and cannot do).โ  ECF No. 90 at 1.  Beaufort \nCounty argues that its liability under Section 1983 โis limited to constitutional violations \ncaused by official policy or custom.โ  Id. at 4 (quoting Littleton v. Swonger, 502 F. \nAppโx 271, 277 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).  This \nmeans that a โpolicy or custom may be written ordinances and regulations, affirmative \ndecisions of individual policymaking officials, omissions by policymaking officials that \nmanifest deliberate indifference to the rights of citizens, and practices so persistent and \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 8 of 10\nwidespread as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.โ  Id. (citing Carter v. \nMorris, 164 F.3d 215, 218 (4th Cir. 1999)).  Thus, Beaufort County claims that the Allen \nMemorandum contains the official policy or custom at issue being challenged because it \nestablished the facially neutral policy of searching all detainees moved from pre-\nclassification to another part of the prison, and not the practice of only moving and \nsearching female detainees.  Id.  Finally, Beaufort County argues that the relevant \npolicymaker, Director Grant, is a woman and member of the protected class, which \nโundermines any claim of discriminatory intent.โ  Id. at 8โ9 (providing a string cite of \ncases where courts purportedly found no discriminatory intent because the decisionmaker \nwas part of the impacted class).   \nTo reiterate, for the court to alter or amend its order under the third exception of \nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), an order cannot merely be โmaybe or probablyโ wrong; it must be \nโdead wrong,โ so as to strike the court โwith the force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated \ndead fish.โ  TFWS, 572 F.3d at 194.  โA partyโs mere disagreement with the courtโs \nruling does not warrant a Rule 59(e) motion, and such motion should not be used to \nโrehashโ arguments previously presented or to submit evidence which should have been \npreviously submitted.โ  Consulting Engโrs, Inc., 2007 WL 2021901, at *2.   \nBeaufort County presented nearly identical argumentsโthat the policy was \nfacially neutral and that plaintiffs failed to create a genuine dispute of material fact \nregarding discriminatory intentโin its objections to the R&R, ECF No. 79 at 9โ11, and \nits motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 48-1 at 11โ13, which the court thoroughly \nreviewed and found to be without merit.  See ECF No. 82 at 8โ11.  The court reminds \nBeaufort County that a Rule 59(e) motion โmay not be used to relitigate old matters, or to \n8 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 9 of 10\nraise arguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of \njudgment.โ  Pac. Ins. Co., 148 F.3d at 403 (internal citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  Beaufort County asserted neither of the first two grounds for reconsideration; \nthe third ground is not available either: Beaufort County has not shown that the court \nmade a clear error of law, nor has it argued that the courtโs decision must be reconsidered \nto prevent manifest injustice.  See Hutchinson, 994 F.2d at 1081.  The court reiterates its \nconclusion from its order:  \n[T]he  action  challenged  is  BCDCโs  practice  of  placing  male  pre-\nclassification  detainees  in  housing  separate  from  general  population \ninmatesโwhich  meant  they  were  not  automatically  subjected  to  strip \nsearchesโwhereas  female  pre-classification  detainees  were  placed  in \ngeneral population and were always subjected to strip searches. . . .  Had \nplaintiffs  been  male,  they  would  have  been  placed  in  separate  pre-\nclassification detainee housing and would have in all likelihood avoided the \nstrip  search.    Consequently,  BCDCโs  practice  clearly  falls  under  the \ncategory of facial sex discrimination. \nECF No. 82 at 11.  Far from being clear error, the courtโs decision was factually \nsupported and legally justified.  See id. (quoting Bauer v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 340, 347โ48 \n(4th Cir. 2016) (โ[T]he Supreme Court outlined . . . a simple test for identifying facial sex \ndiscrimination: such discrimination appears where the evidence shows treatment of a \nperson in a manner which but for that personโs sex would be differentโ) (internal \nquotation marks omitted and emphasis added).  Beaufort Countyโs โmere disagreementโ \nwith the courtโs consideration of the practice at issue, versus the policy, โdoes not support \na Rule 59(e) motion.โ  See id. at 1082.   \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons the court DENIES the motion to reconsider.   \n   \n   \n9 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN     Date Filed 08/01/23    Entry Number 104     Page 10 of 10\nAND IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \nDAVID C.

ECF No. 48. \nPlaintiffs filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion (ECF No. 56)1, and Defendants filed a \nReply (ECF No. 63). The Motion is ripe for review.2  \nBACKGROUND \nThis case involves certain procedures used for female pre-classification detainees at the \nBeaufort County Detention Center (โBCDCโ or โDetention Centerโ). A pre-classification detainee \nis an inmate who has been arrested and placed or housed in an area at the detention center prior to \ngoing to a bond hearing. ECF No. 34-1 at 20:7โ14. Once a pre-trial detainee goes to a bond hearing \nand cannot produce a bond, upon returning to BCDC, he or she is then classified to a different area \n \n1 Within their Response, Plaintiffs seek leave to amend their Amended Complaint several times. \nAlthough no formal motion has been filed, the undersigned addresses Plaintiffsโ requests for leave \nto amend at the appropriate substantive sections herein. \n  \n2 All pretrial proceedings in this case were referred to the undersigned pursuant to the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(f) (D.S.C.). Pursuant to \nthose provisions, this Report and Recommendation is entered for review by the District Judge. \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 2 of 39\nat BCDC, such as in general population or, depending on the inmateโs behavior, maximum or super \nmaximum security. ECF No. 34-3 at 21:3โ18. \nDefendant Beaufort County operates BCDC. ECF Nos. 12 ยถ 7, 13 ยถ 5. Defendant Philip \nFoot (โFootโ) is the Assistant County Administrator for Public Safety Division who oversees  \nBCDC. ECF Nos. 12 at ยถ 8, 13 ยถ 6. Defendant Quandara Grant (โGrantโ) is a Colonel and the \ndirector of the BCDC. ECF Nos. 12 at ยถ 9, 13 ยถ 6. Defendants John Does 1โ5 are described in the \nAmended Complaint as โBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ responsible for the training, supervision, \ncontrol, assignment, and discipline of County personnel at BCDC, and for the formulation, \nadministration, and enforcement of the policies, rules, regulations, and practices of BCDC. ECF \nNo. 12 at  ยถ 10. Defendants Jane Does 1โ5 are described in the Amended Complaint as โBCDC \nOfficer Defendantsโ who were, at all times relevant to this action, Beaufort County employees \nwho worked as correctional officers at BCDC. Id. at ยถ 11. \nBDCD Strip Search Policy and Practice \nPrior to February 27, 2015, pursuant to BCDC policy, female pre-classification detainees \nwere not strip searched,3 unless reasonable suspicion existed. ECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 5. Moreover, at \nthat time, no inmate was strip searched upon going into BCDCโs general population, absent a \nspecific reason. ECF No. 48-2 at 5, Grant Dep. at 52:7โ53:9. According to Defendants, this policy \nresulted in the passing of contraband from pre-classification inmates going into the general \npopulation. Id.  \n \n3 The terms โstrip searchโ and โvisual body cavity searchโ (vbc) are used throughout this Report \nand Recommendation and, and at times, the term โstrip/vbc searchโ may be used. A strip search \ninvolves partial or complete disrobing but not necessarily a body cavity inspection, while a visual \nbody cavity search involves visual inspection of rectal, vaginal and other body cavities. Strip/vbc \nsearches involve removal of all clothing to permit inspection of all body openings including ears, \nnostrils, anus, navel, and mouth. ECF No. 31-2. They include a thorough inspection of the hair, \ncrotch area, abdomen, soles of the feet, armpits, and areas between the fingers and toes. Id.  \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 3 of 39\nOn February 27, 2015, BCDC adopted a policy (โPolicyโ) that all inmates being moved \nfrom pre-classification to other areas of BCDC, including general population, would be strip \nsearched. The Policy provides in relevant part: \nSub:  Strip Search of all Inmates leaving Pre-Class \n1.  Effective this date all inmates being moved from Pre-Class to other areas of the \nfacility will be strip-searched as a matter of policy. \n \n2.  The Pre-Class officer assisted by other members of the shift will strip search all \ninmates that are being moved by Classifications to other areas of the facility, as \npart of the process of changing uniforms.  \n \nECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 6.4 \nBCDCโs practice (โPracticeโ) has been to house female pre-classification inmates in \ngeneral population while placing male pre-classification inmates in a separate pre-classification \ncell outside of general population. ECF No. 31-3 at 14, Black Dep. 24:2โ20. Because female pre-\nclassification detainees are held in general population at the outset, BCDC conducts a strip/vbc \nsearch on every female pre-classification detainee5 awaiting a bond hearing. ECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 6. \nBCDC did not, however, do so for similarly situated male pre-classification detainees prior to May \n5, 2020, as they were housed in a separate pre-classification cell outside of general population.6 \n \n4 The citation provided by Defendants for the referenced Policy is an affidavit of Quandara Grant; \nhowever, the Policy is not attached to the affidavit. Plaintiffs attached a copy of the Policy to an \nearlier brief in the case. ECF No. 31-4 at 2.   \n \n5 โ[W]e instruct [females] to remove their clothing one item at a time and hand them to the booking \nofficer.โ ECF No. 31-3 at 3, Black Dep. 18:25โ19:2. โ[W]e have them lift their breasts, raise \ntheirโboth arms and then we have them bend over.โ Id. โThen we ask them to turn around and \nface the wall. We ask them to bend over at the waist, squat, reach back and grab their cheeksโ \ntheir butt cheeks, spread and cough three times hard from the stomach.โ Id. at 20:5โ9. The guards \ncan tell when someone is coughing because they watch the movement of the โvagina and the anal.โ \nId. at 34:12. \n6 According to Defendants, because of Covid protocols, as of May 5, 2020, pre-classification males \nare now also held in general population and, thus, also strip searched. ECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 7. \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 4 of 39\nThere is no dispute between the parties that this Practice was in effect at BCDC between February \n27, 2015, and May 5, 2020. See ECF No. 40 at 2. \nPlaintiffsโ Experiences at BCDC7 \nPlaintiff Cheryl Munday (โMundayโ) was arrested by the Bluffton Police Department on \nMarch 9, 2018, for driving under the influence, which charge was later dismissed. The arresting \nofficer delivered her into the custody of BCDC officers for the booking process, where she \nunderwent a full body pat down, strip search and visual body cavity search. ECF Nos. 12 at ยถยถ 15โ\n19; 13 at ยถยถ 10, 12, 13. At the onset of the booking process, Munday alleges that a BCDC officer \nreviewed her personal information and commented that she โlook[ed] great,โ before informing her \nthat she was subject to a full body โpat downโ and conducting the pat down. ECF No. 12 at ยถยถ 15โ\n17. Munday alleges that the officer placed her hands on Mundayโs ankles and worked her way up \nthe legs, grabbing Mundayโs crotch and running a finger along her vaginal area. Id.; see also ECF \nNo. 56 at 23โ24. Munday alleges that the officer inserted a finger into her vagina until clothing \nprevented it from going further inside. Id. Munday claims that the pat down continued to her upper \nbody where the officer attempted to insert her hands under Mundayโs bra. Id. \nAccording to Munday, following the pat-down, she was taken to a small area known as the \nโstrip-search roomโ and required to remove her clothing. ECF No. 12 at ยถยถ 15โ17. While nude, \nshe contends she was required several times to bend over, spread her buttocks and cough. Id.  \nMunday further contends that the officer conducting the strip search became angry and started \nshouting. Id. She claims that the door remained open during the strip search so that passersby could \n \n7 The facts regarding Plaintiffsโ experiences are taken largely from the allegations in the Amended \nComplaint, as cited by Defendants throughout their Motion. ECF No. 12. Although Plaintiffs cited \nto some portions of Plaintiff Mundayโs deposition transcript, ECF No. 56 at 24, they do not include \ncopies of either Plaintiffโs deposition transcript with their Response. Defendants attach excerpts \nof Plaintiffsโ depositions to their Motion; however, the excerpts are heavily redacted.  \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 5 of 39\nsee her naked body. Id. Munday alleges that she was led back to the lobby, where she witnessed a \nmale arrestee being booked, who was only patted from the knees down only and that the manโs \ngroin or buttocks were not searched. Id. at ยถ 19. \nPlaintiff Margaret Devine (โDevineโ) was arrested by the Highway Patrol on January 17, \n2019, for driving under the influence; the charge was later dismissed. According to Devine, after \nshe was transported to BCDC to begin the booking process, a BCDC officer initiated a full body \npat down followed by a strip search and visual body cavity search of her.  ECF No. 12 at ยถยถ 20โ\n24. Devine alleges that she was led to a shower stall and required to remove her clothes. ECF No. \n12 at ยถ 22. She contends that the shower stall was open so that passersby were able to see in. Id. \nAfter Devine removed her clothes, two guards allegedly instructed her to turn around, face a wall, \nbend over from the waist so that her backside and genitalia were exposed, and cough. Id. Devine \nclaims that, despite her compliance, the officers ordered her to โcough harder and louder.โ ECF \nNo. 12 at ยถ 23. The guards then allegedly ordered her to take a shower while they watched. Id. She \nclaims that the guards required her to shower again, making sure to wet her hair completely. ECF \nNo. 12 at ยถ 24. \nClaims in Case \nPlaintiffs have asserted seven causes of action against all Defendants and two causes of \naction against Beaufort County only, as noted:  (1) 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the Fourth \nAmendment; (2) 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment; (3) Article I, Section 10 of the South Carolina Constitution regarding privacy; \n(4) Article I, Section 3 of the South Carolina Constitution regarding equal protection; (5) Negligent \nDeprivation  of  Statutory  Rights  under  South  Carolina  Tort  Claims  Act  (against  Defendant \nBeaufort County only); (6) Reckless Infliction of Emotional Distress (against Defendant Beaufort \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 6 of 39\nCounty only); (7) Assault; (8) Battery; and (9) Negligence. Plaintiffs are also seeking attorneysโ \nfees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  \nDefendants have moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffsโ claims, as well as their \nrequest for attorneysโ fees. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is appropriate if a party โshows there is no genuine dispute as to any \nissue of material factโ and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(a). Under the framework established in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986), the \nparty seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of demonstrating to the Court that \nthere is no genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 323. Once the movant has made this threshold \ndemonstration,  the  non-moving  party,  to  survive  the  motion  for  summary  judgment,  must \ndemonstrate that specific, material facts exist which give rise to a genuine issue. Id. at 324. \nUnder this standard, the evidence of the non-moving party is to be believed and all \njustifiable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). However, although the Court views all the underlying facts \nand inferences in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the non-moving \nโparty nonetheless must offer some โconcrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return \na verdict in his [or her] favor.โโ Williams v. Genex Servs., LLC, 809 F.3d 103, 109 (4th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256). That is to say, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence \nin support of the plaintiffโs position is insufficient to withstand the summary judgment motion. \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Likewise, conclusory or speculative allegations or denials, without \nmore, are insufficient to preclude the granting of the summary judgment motion. Thompson v. \nPotomac Elec. Power Co., 312 F.3d 645, 649 (4th Cir. 2002). โOnly disputes over facts that might \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 7 of 39\naffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary \njudgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.โ Anderson, 477 \nU.S. at 248. To survive summary judgment, the non-movant must provide evidence of every \nelement essential to his action on which he will bear the burden of proving at a trial on the merits. \nCelotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \nA. Plaintiffsโ Claims Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983   \nโSection 1983 of Title 42 creates a cause of action against any person who, acting under \ncolor of state law, abridges a right arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.โ \nCooper v. Sheehan, 735 F.3d 153, 158 (4th Cir. 2013). Section 1983 โis not itself a source of \nsubstantive  rights,  but  merely  provides  a  method  for  vindicating  federal  rights  elsewhere \nconferred.โ Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nPlaintiffs bring two claims under ยง 1983, alleging that Defendants violated their rights \nunder the Fourth Amendment (Count 1) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (Count 2).  Defendants have moved for summary judgment on both claims. \n1.   Fourth Amendment (Count 1) \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants subjected them to โunnecessary, demeaning, outrageous \nand intrusive strip and body cavity search[es]โ that violated their rights to be secure โagainst \nunreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States.โ ECF No. 12 at ยถ 48.  \nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees citizens the right โto be secure in their persons . . . \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.โ U.S. Const., Amend. IV; see Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. \n643, 655 (1961) (finding that the Fourth Amendment is made applicable to the states through the \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 8 of 39\nFourteenth Amendment). It is well established that assessing a searchโs reasonableness โrequires \na balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.โ Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In conducting this analysis, โ[c]ourts \nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.โ Id. The Fourth Circuit employs \nthe Bell test โto determine the reasonableness of a broad range of sexually invasive searches,โ \nincluding strip searches and visual body cavity searches.

Beaufort County \nPlaintiffs make no argument in their Response regarding their Fourth Amendment claim \nagainst Beaufort County. The undersigned deems the arguments abandoned or waived.

Individual Defendants  \nAs to Defendants Foot and Grant, Plaintiffs do not argue that either of them personally \nparticipated  in  or  conducted  any  strip  search  of either  Plaintiff.  Instead,  Plaintiffs  contend \nDefendants Foot and Grant are liable in their supervisory capacities because they knew or should \nhave known โtheir subordinates were strip searching all female pre-classification detainees, but \nnot all similarly situated males during the class period.โ ECF No. 56 at 15. However, all of \nPlaintiffsโ arguments regarding Defendantsโ subordinates are premised upon alleged unequal \ntreatment of female and male pre-classification detainees when conducting strip searches.8 See id. \nThis claim of unequal treatment is founded upon an alleged violation of the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Fourth Amendment.  \nPlaintiffs make no argument, nor point to any evidence in the record, as to how any of the \nindividual Defendants or their subordinatesโincluding any Doe Defendantsโviolated Plaintiffsโ \nFourth  Amendment  rights  to  be free  from  โunreasonable  searches  and  seizures.โ  Although \nPlaintiffs  have  described  the  strip  searches  in  their  Amended  Complaint  as  โunnecessary, \ndemeaning, outrageous and intrusive,โ they do not appear to dispute the general validity of \nBCDCโs Policy of strip searching detainees, like themselves, who are in contact with BCDCโs \ngeneral population. Indeed, the law is clear that a strip search in that context is permissible. See \n \n8 Specifically, Plaintiffs argue the following: \nFoot and Grant knew that female pre-classification detainees were not afforded a \nseparate pre-classification holding area like males were. Grant, who approved the \nnew strip search policy in 2015, logically knew that her subordinates were strip-\nsearching all female pre-classification detainees, but not all similarly situated \nmales. Foot also knew that pre-classification males were excepted from strip-\nsearches. Despite such knowledge, Foot and Grant made no effort to relocate \nfemale pre-classification detainees into a separate holding area or to afford them \nthe comparable comforts males enjoyed. \nECF No. 56 at 15 (citations omitted). \n10 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 11 of 39\nFlorence, 566 U.S. at 333โ34. Nor do Plaintiffs make any arguments regarding application of the \nBell test to determine the reasonableness of the contested searches. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559; \nEdwards, 666 F.3d at 883; see also Calloway, 948 F.3d at 201. \nInstead, Plaintiffsโ arguments pertain only to BCDCโs Practice of treating male and female \npre-classification detainees differently, which is addressed below in the analysis of Plaintiffโs \nclaim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because Plaintiffs make \nno argument in their Response, nor point to any evidence, regarding the unreasonableness of or \npunitive intent behind their specific strip searches, see Frazier, 2021 WL 1799346, at *3, the \nundersigned finds that Plaintiffs have failed to create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding \ntheir Fourth Amendment claim. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends granting Defendantsโ \nMotion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claim against the individual Defendants, \nincluding Defendants Foot and Grant and the Doe Defendants, based upon a violation of their \nFourth Amendment rights. \n2.  Equal Protection Clause (Count 2) \nPlaintiffs allege that the unequal treatment of men and women detainees deprived them of \nโclearly  established  protections  afforded  by  the  equal  protection  guarantees  of  the  14th \nAmendment.โ ECF No. 12 at ยถ 53. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that the procedures used by BCDC \nbetween February 27, 2015, and May 5, 2020, to process the intake of similarly situated female \nand male pretrial detainees were different because, while all women in pre-classification status \nwere housed in general population and subjected to routine strip/vbc searches, similarly-situated \nmen in pre-classification status were not. ECF No. 12 ยถยถ 4, 25โ28. \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall \nโdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ U.S. Const. amend. \n11 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 12 of 39\nXIV, ยง 1. The Clause โis essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated \nalike.โ Fisher v. King, 232 F.3d 391, 399 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985)).  \nโAn equal protection violation occurs in one of two ways: (1) when the government \nexplicitly  classifies  people  based  on  [sex],  or  (2) when  a  law  is  facially  neutral,  but  its \nadministration or enforcement disproportionately affects one class of persons over another and a \ndiscriminatory intent or animus is shown.โ Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, 579 F.3d 380, 388 \n(4th Cir. 2009). Thus, to analyze a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, the first step is to \nidentify the classification at issue. That determination, in turn, informs the governmentโs burden \nof proof.  \nCertain laws or regulations distinguish among groups on their face. Others are facially-\nneutral but nonetheless disproportionately affect certain groups. With respect to the latter category, \na viable Equal Protection claim exists only when the plaintiff can demonstrate that a disparate \nimpact and discriminatory intent nonetheless lie behind the facially-neutral law. See, e.g., Pers. \nAdmโr of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272โ74 (1979); Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 730โ31 \n(4th Cir. 2002) (โTo succeed on an equal protection claim, [a detainee] โmust first demonstrate \nthat [s]he has been treated differently from others with whom [s]he is similarly situated and that \nthe unequal treatment was the result of intentional or purposeful discrimination.โโ) (quoting \nMorrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001)). By contrast, with respect to the former, \nwhere a line is overtly drawn on the basis of gender, a suspect classification is established by \ndefinition and there is no need to establish discriminatory intent. \n12 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 13 of 39\nIf a plaintiff makes either showing, โthe court proceeds to determine whether the disparity \nin treatment can be justified under the requisite level of scrutiny.โ Veney, 293 F.3d at 731 (quoting \nMorrison, 239 F.3d at 654). \na.  Beaufort County \ni.  Different Treatment \nAccording to Defendants, the Court need not engage in any scrutiny at all (and they need \nnot advance any justification for their actions) because a valid Equal Protection claim must \nestablish that women were treated differently from men and that such unequal treatment stemmed \nfrom a discriminatory intent. Defendants argue that, while women and men pretrial detainees were \nundoubtedly treated differently, it was the result of a facially neutral policy that requires all \ndetainees moving to general population, male and female, to be strip searched. ECF No. 48-1 at \n12โ13.  They  contend,  under  the  circumstances,  Plaintiffs  have  toโโand  cannotโโshow \ndiscriminatory intent, such that their claim fails.   \nThis argument ignores, however, that BCDCโs Policy, which applies to inmates โbeing \nmoved from Pre-Class to other areas of the facility,โ is not at issue in this case. Rather, Plaintiffsโ \nclaims are based upon their pre-classification status alone, at the outset of their arrest, not their \nmovement from pre-classification to any other area of the facility.9 ECF No. 12 at ยถยถ 25, 27. \nIndeed, it is undisputed that BCDCโs Practice was to conduct a strip search on every female pre-\n \n9 Even construing Defendantsโ argument liberally, it begs the question why female pretrial \ndetainees were housed in general population at the outset, while male pretrial detainees were not. \nThe separate housing, in and of itself, is not facially neutral but, instead, an explicit classification \nbased on sex. See Monroe, 579 F.3d at 388. This explicit classification, which resulted in the strip \nsearching of female pretrial detainees but not male pretrial detainees, is subject to scrutiny, as \naddressed further herein below. \n13 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 14 of 39\nclassification detainee awaiting bond between February 27, 2015, and May 5, 2020, but not on \nmale pre-classification detainees during that time. See generally ECF No. 40-1.  \nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the undersigned agrees with \nPlaintiffs that BCDCโs Practice of strip-searching female pre-classification detainees but not male \npre-classification detaineesโbetween February 27, 2015, and May 5, 2020โis not gender neutral \nbut, instead, โintentional disparity in treatment from other similarly situated inmatesโ based on \nsex. See King v. Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 221 (4th Cir. 2016) (reversing dismissal of inmateโs \nequal protection claim alleging that he was treated differently from two other inmates when he was \nrequired to have surgery to remove implants in his penis while they were not required to undergo \nsurgery); see also Bullock v. Dart, 599 F. Supp. 2d 947, 957 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (finding that jailโs \npractice of strip-searching and returning to housing areas all male detainees, including possible \ndischarges, while โsegregating female possible discharges from the remainder of the female court \nreturns, such that female actual returns may elect to avoid strip searches, is not gender-neutral on \nits faceโ).  \nii.  Scrutiny \nState action that is explicitly based on sex generally is subject to certain scrutiny, and the \nburden is on the State to justify its action thereunder.10 United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, \n533 (1996). The Fourth Circuit has explained that when equal protection challenges arise in a \n \n10 Defendants argue in their initial brief that BCDCโs strip search Policy is subject to intermediate \nscrutiny. ECF No. 48-1 at 13โ15.  โIntermediate scrutiny, [ ]means โit must be established at least \nthat  the  challenged  classification  serves  important  governmental  objectives  and  that  the \ndiscriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.โโ \nAdkins v. Rumsfeld, 464 F.3d 456, 468 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 60 \n(2001)). However, for the first time in Reply, Defendants argue that a more relaxed constitutional \nstandard applies. ECF No. 63 at 9โ12. The undersigned has analyzed the issues in this case under \na more relaxed standard, as explained above. \n14 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 15 of 39\nprison or jail context, โcourts must adjust the level of scrutiny to ensure that prison officials are \nafforded the necessary discretion to operate their facilities in a safe and secure manner.โ Veney, \n293 F.3d at 732 (evaluating equal protection claim brought by jail inmate). Under this more \ndeferential standard, courts must determine whether the disparate treatment is โreasonably related \nto [any] legitimate penological interests.โ Id. (explaining that while courts are to โapply this \ndeferential standard even when the alleged infringed constitutional right would otherwise warrant \nhigher scrutiny[,] . . . this more deferential review does not make [the court] ignorant to the \nconcerns that justify application of a heightened standard outside of the prison contextโ) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn determining whether an action is reasonable under this deferential standard, courts \nconsider the following factors: (1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the policy \nand penological interest; (2) whether an alternative means of exercising the right remains available \nto the inmate; (3) the impact accommodation of the asserted right will have on guards, other \ninmates, and the allocation of prison resources; and (4) the absence of ready alternatives that \naccommodate prisonersโ rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests. Morrison, 239 \nF.3d at 655 (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89โ90 (1987)). The undersigned concludes that \neven under Morrisonโs less rigorous standard, Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient evidence to \nsupport an Equal Protection claim against BCDC, at least at this stage of the litigation. \nHere, with regard to the first factor, Defendants emphasize that all female pre-classification \ndetainees, unlike their male counterparts, were held in the jailโs general population area where \nweapons and contraband posed a danger. ECF No. 48-1 at 14. As such, they contend they โhad a \nlegitimate penological interest in preventing the smuggling of contraband into general population.โ \nECF No. 63 at 12.  \n15 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 16 of 39\nPreventing the passage of contraband is undoubtedly a legitimate penological interest. See \nJehovah v. Clarke, 798 F.3d 169, 178 (4th Cir. 2015) (โPromoting the inmatesโ safety and health \nis a legitimate concern.โ); Veney, 293 F.3d at 732 (โPrison safety and security are legitimate \npenological interests that [the court] must consider.โ).  Notably, Defendants cite to Florence v. Bd. \nof  Chosen  Freeholders,  566  U.S.  318  (2012),  for  the  proposition  that  โgeneral  population \ndramatically magnifies the dangers posed by weapons and other contraband.โ Id. However, while \nthe Florence case acknowledged jail officials may strip search individuals who have been arrested \nfor any crime before admitting them to jail, it does not authorize differential treatment by jail \nofficials.11   \nDefendantsโ argument, again, begs the question why female pretrial detainees are placed \nin general population in the first instance, thereby subjecting them to strip searches, while male \npretrial detainees were not.  See footnote 9, supra.  Indeed, Defendants contend that the strip search \nof female pre-classification detainees was not โbecause they are femaleโ but, instead, a โbyproduct \nof  the  logistical  fact  that  women  pre-classification  [detainees]  must  be  placed  in  general \npopulation, whereas there exists a separate pre-classification holding area for male [detainees].โ12 \nECF No. 48-1 at 13. According to Defendants, this different treatment was โin part due to the \nrequirement, under the Minimum Standards for Local Detention Facilities in South Carolina [that] \n \n11 The undersigned notes the obvious security concerns raised in the Florence case; however, it \nbears mentioning here the โYear End Reports for Beaufort County Detention Centerโ for 2010, \n2011, 2012 and 2015, which show that Defendants conducted 18,402 โshakedownsโ of inmatesโ \ncells prior to adoption of the strip-search practice at issue here and found no serious contraband. \nECF No. 56-1.   \n \n12 The undersigned has replaced the word โprisoners,โ used by Defendants in their brief, with \nโdetainees,โ as this case concerns arrestees detained in a detention center and awaiting an initial \nbond hearing, not convicted prisoners. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 545 (distinguishing between โpretrial \ndetainees, who have not been convicted of any crimes,โ and โconvicted prisonersโ); Williamson v. \nStirling, 912 F.3d 154, 176, 184 (4th Cir. 2018) (same). \n16 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 17 of 39\nโ[f]emale inmates shall be housed in an area separated from normal auditory and visual contact \nwith male inmates.โโ ECF No. 63 at 7.  \nThis argument segues into the fourth Morrison factor: the absence of ready alternatives \nthat accommodate prisonersโ rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests. Specifically, \ntwo ready alternatives appear to present themselves: (1) placing female pre-classification detainees \nin a separate pre-classification holding area so that they would not need to be strip searched, or \n(2) placing male pre-classification detainees in general population so that they, too, would be strip \nsearched.   \nAs to the first alternative, Defendants argue that BCDC could not modify its existing \nstructure to separate pre-classification female detainees. Id. Their argument boils down to the \nfollowing: โThere is no evidence to support that the location of the female pre-classification area \nwas the result of a gender-based reason. Instead, it was a result of the neutral realities of the \nconstruction of the Detention Center.โ Id. \nThis argument, however, is unavailing at this stage in the litigation. Indeed, at least some \ncourts have recognized that such โneutral realities,โ id., are not sufficient to justify treating male \nand female inmates differently: โVague and general references to funding and space constraints \ncannot justify a policy that resulted directly in the strip and visual body cavity searches of \nthousands of female arrestees, while permitting their male counterparts to rest in the relative \ncomfort and security of [ ] lockups.โ Ford v. Suffolk County, 154 F. Supp. 2d 131, 151 (D. Mass. \n2001); see also Bukhari v. Hutto, 487 F. Supp. 1162, 1171โ72 (E.D. Va. 1980) (โThe Court \nsympathizes with defendants who must deal with the fiscal reality that providing for a wide range \nof programs for a smaller number of prisoners entails a greater cost. However, such seemingly \npractical considerations may not be used to justify official inaction or legislative unwillingness to \n17 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 18 of 39\noperate a prison system in a constitutional manner.โ) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted).   \nPlaintiffs emphasize that, despite two studies in 2008 and 2017 to address capacity \nchallenges, Defendants did not attempt to identify existing space that could house female pre-\nclassification  detainees  separately.  ECF  No.  56  at  12โ13.  In  2008,  the  Beaufort  County \nAdministrator commissioned a study on BCDC overcrowding, concluding that:  \nThe final recommendation is the construction of a new detention center space. This \nrecommendation, although the most expensive, is unavoidable given the increase \nin population of Beaufort County and other circumstances that unfortunately exist \nin society. . . . The amount required is yet to be determined; however, planning for \nlocation and funding should begin now. \nECF No. 56-2 at 28.   \nA second study followed in 2017. ECF No. 56-1.  That study identified six different options \nto satisfy an ultimate capacity of approximately 900โ1,000 inmates to meet future needs. Id. at 6. \nFor each option, schematic drawings were prepared and studied, along with estimates of probable \nconstruction costs. Id. at 7. As noted by Plaintiffs, during the course of the second study, \nDefendants did not attempt to identify space that could house female pre-classification detainees.  \nECF No. 56-3, David Dep. at 16:12โ23, 17:8โ11, 19:3โ12.   \nDefendants have not offered any explanation or argument to address the funding and space \nconstraints. Nor have Defendants presented any argument regarding the second question:  why, if \nthere was no way to house female pre-classification detainees in a separate space, male pre-\nclassification detainees could not also be placed in general population. Tellingly, Defendants \neventually removed the pre-classification holding area for male detainees during the pandemic and \nplaced them in general population. There is no evidence before the Court to suggest that this \nchange strained BCDC resources. See Morrison, 239 F.3d at 655 (third factor). This measure alone \nindicates an ability to treat male and female pre-classification detainees equally, and that there was \n18 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 19 of 39\na โready alternativeโ available to accommodate female pre-classification detaineesโ rights โat de \nminimis cost to valid penological interests.โ See id. (fourth factor); see also Jones v. Murphy, 567 \nF. Supp. 2d 787, 791 (D. Md. 2008) (denying defendantsโ motion for summary judgment and \nexplaining: โTo treat male and female arrestees equally for search purposes, however, Central \nBooking officials simply needed either to stop searching male arrestees to their underwear, or to \nstart searching all arrestees to their underwear.

[T]he January 2006 decision to search all arrestees to their \nlast layer of clothing demonstrates just how readily available a constitutional alternative was to the \n[jail].โ). \nUnder these circumstances, Defendants have not established that Beaufort County is \nentitled to summary judgment on this claim. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends denying \nDefendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffโs ยง 1983 claim against Beaufort County \nalleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.13   \n  b.

Sumner, \n973 F.2d 295, 298 (4th Cir. 1992) (โOfficials are not liable for bad guesses in gray areas; they are \nliable for transgressing bright lines.โ). \nIn resolving questions of qualified immunity at summary judgment, courts engage in a two-\npronged inquiry: (1) โwhether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the \ninjury, show the officerโs conduct violated a federal rightโ; and (2) โwhether the right in question \nwas โclearly establishedโ at the time of the violation.โ Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 655โ56 \n(2014) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236; see Adams v. \nFerguson, 884 F.3d 219, 226 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that courts can โskip ahead to the question \nwhether the law clearly established that the officerโs conduct was unlawful in the circumstances \nof the caseโ) (quoting Pearson, 555 U.S. at 232) (internal quotation marks omitted). โBut under \neither prong, courts may not resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary \njudgment.โ Tolan, 572 U.S. at 656. \nAs to the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis, for purposes of Defendantsโ \nMotion only, the undersigned assumes a constitutional violation under the Fourteenth Amendment \nby Defendants Foot and Grant and the Doe Defendants. With regard to the second prong, however, \nthe undersigned agrees with Defendants that it was not clearly established at the time of the arrest \nthat any Individual Defendantโs conductโโstrip searching, or allowing strip searching, of female \npre-classification detainees but not male pre-classification detainees under the circumstances \npresented  at  BCDCโโviolated  Plaintiffsโ  Equal  Protection  rights  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. See ECF No. 49-1 at 13; ECF No. 55 at 8.  \n  When inquiring whether a constitutional right is clearly established, a court must first \nโdefine the precise right into which [it is] inquiring.โ Est. of Armstrong ex rel. Armstrong v. Vill. \nof Pinehurst, 810 F.3d 892, 907 (4th Cir. 2016). After defining the right, the court then asks \nwhether it was clearly established at the time the officers acted. Id. A right satisfies this standard \nwhen it is โsufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is \ndoing violates that right.โ Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11 (2015); Hill v. Crum, 727 F.3d 312, \n321 (4th Cir. 2013). \n21 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 22 of 39\nFor a right to be clearly established, โexisting precedent15 must have placed the statutory \nor constitutional question beyond debate.โ Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011); see City \n& Cnty. of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.S. 600, 611 (2015) (โThis exacting standard gives \ngovernment officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments by protecting all \nbut the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.โ) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). โThis is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the \nvery action in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-\nexisting law the unlawfulness must be apparent.โ Armstrong, 810 F.3d at 907 (quoting Wilson v. \nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999)). Indeed, a right may be clearly established if โa general \nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law applies with obvious clarity to the \nspecific conduct in question.โ Booker v. S.C. Depโt of Corr., 855 F.3d 533, 543 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(alterations omitted) (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002)); see also Owens ex rel. \nOwens v. Lott, 372 F.3d 267, 279 (4th Cir. 2004) (stating that a right may be clearly established if \nit is โmanifestly apparent from broader applications of the constitutional premise in questionโ). \nThus, officers can be โon notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual \ncircumstances.โ Armstrong, 810 F.3d at 907 (quoting Hope, 536 U.S. at 741).  \nNonetheless, even though general statements of law may provide notice, courts must not \nโdefine clearly established law at a high level of generality,โ Mullenix, 577 U.S. at 12 (quoting al-\n \n15 โThe universe of existing precedent is not unlimited,โ and courts in the Fourth Circuit โordinarily \nneed not look beyond the decisions of the Supreme Court, th[e] Fourth Circuit court of appeals, \nand the highest court of the state in which the case arose.โ West v.

Rather, courts must examine โwhether the violative nature of particular \nconduct is clearly established.โ Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742). This \nexamination is โundertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general \nproposition.โ Id. (quoting Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004)). โIf the right was not \nclearly established in the specific context of the case โ that is, if it was not clear to a reasonable \n[official] that the conduct in which he allegedly engaged was unlawful in the situation he \nconfronted โ then the law affords immunity from suit.โ Parrish v. Cleveland, 372 F.3d 294, 301 \n(4th Cir. 2004). \nPlaintiffs argue that, at the time they were strip searched, โequal protection rights in the \nprison context were well established.โ ECF No. 56 at 16.  Plaintiffs define the relevant issue as the \nโdifferential treatment of male and female pre-classification detainees regarding strip-searches in \nviolation of Plaintiffsโ right to Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.โ Id. at 19.  \nHowever, framing the issue in this manner, specifically the law regarding equal protection under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, is cast at a high level of generality and does not by itself create clearly \nestablished law outside an obvious case. \nAs noted above, the Supreme Court has held that โcourts must not define clearly established \nlaw at a high level of generality, since doing so avoids the crucial question whether the official \nacted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she faced.โ See District of Columbia v. \nWesby, 138 S. Ct. 577, 590 (2018). This inquiry โโmust be undertaken in light of the specific \ncontext of the case, not as a broad general proposition.โโ See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, \n198 (2004) (per curiam) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)). As the Fourth Circuit \nhas โspelled out with specificity, qualified immunity protects law officers from bad guesses in gray \nareas, and it ensures that they may be held personally liable only for transgressing bright lines.โ \n23 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 24 of 39\nGomez v. Atkins, 296 F.3d 253, 261 (4th Cir. 2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, the relevant issue for purposes of qualified immunity is whether strip searching \nfemale  pre-classification  detainees  but  not  male  pre-classification  detainees  violates  equal \nprotection where the female pre-classification area is in general population and the male pre-\nclassification area is not. The parties do not point to any controlling authority from the United \nStates Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit or this District sufficiently similar to the situation the \nindividual Defendants confronted in this case that would have made clear to them that their conduct \nunder BCDCโs Practice violated Plaintiffsโ equal protection rights. Nor is there a consensus of \ncases of persuasive authority from other jurisdictions that would otherwise make it โsufficiently \nclear that every reasonable official would have understoodโ that what the individual Defendants \ndid in this case violated that right. See Mullenix, 577 U.S. at 11; Hill, 727 F.3d at 321. \nNotably, prior to BCDCโs Practice, the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth \nAmendment does not prohibit a policy requiring the strip searching of all detainees who will be in \na jailโs general population. See Florence, 566 U.S. at 333โ34. Defendant Grant testified that \nโ[o]nce the case law came out saying that we could strip search prior to them entering general \npopulation, then we changed.โ ECF No. 48-1, Grant Dep. at 41:17โ20. The issue here under the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment arises from the different locations of the \npre-classification areas for men and women at the time at BCDC. Under these circumstances, the \nundersigned cannot find that the law was โsufficiently clear that every reasonable official would \nhave understood that what he is doing violates that right.โ Mullenix, 577 U.S. at 11; Hill, 727 F.3d \nat 321. \n24 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 25 of 39\nAccordingly, the undersigned recommends finding that Defendants Grant and Foot, as well \nas any Doe Defendants, are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claim under the \nFourteenth Amendment and granting their Motion for Summary Judgment on this claim. \nB. Claims for Violations of the South Carolina Constitution (Counts 3 and 4)  \nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants violated their rights under Article I, ยง 10 (Count 3) \nand Article I, ยง 3 (Count 4) of the South Carolina Constitution. In those causes of action, Plaintiffs \nrequest only money damages. See ECF No. 12 at ยถยถ 59 & 62. In their Response to Defendantsโ \nMotion, Plaintiffs have conceded that the South Carolina Constitution does not provide for \nmonetary damages for civil rights violations and, as such, have withdrawn Counts 3 and 4 from \ntheir Complaint.16 Accordingly, the undersigned recommends granting summary judgment to \nDefendants, including any Doe Defendants, on these claims. See Palmer v. State, 829 S.E.2d 255, \n261 (S.C. Ct. App. 2019) (explaining that โthe South Carolina Constitution does not provide for \nmonetary damages for civil rights violations and the legislature has not enacted an enabling \nstatuteโ); Rosendall v. Voight, C/A No. 4:17-cv-0821-BHH-TER, 2017 WL 9674476, at *2 \n(D.S.C. Sept. 11, 2017) (South Carolina does not have a statute allowing for civil damages for \nviolations of the state constitution), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 WL 2093722 \n(D.S.C. May 7, 2018).  \n \n16 In this instance, Plaintiffs seek leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to strike โCount 6โ; \nhowever, the alleged violations of the South Carolina Constitution are contained in Counts 3 and \n4 of Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint. ECF No. 12 at 15โ16.  Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs want \nto file a Second Amended Complaint to incorporate the allegations supporting their claims in \nCounts 3 and 4 into their negligence claim or any other claims in the case, the undersigned finds \nthat exercise unnecessary. There are no additional substantive allegations contained in Counts 3 \nand 4 (as set forth in paragraphs 57 โ 62) from the rest of the Amended Complaint and Plaintiffs \nalready have sufficiently โrestate[d] and incorporate[d]โ all of the paragraphs into their negligence \ncause of action. ECF No. 12 at 16. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends denying any request \nto amend. \n25 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 26 of 39\nC. Outrage (Count 6), Assault (Count 7) and Battery (Count 8) Claims  \nPlaintiffsโ sixth cause of action is for โreckless infliction of emotional distress/outrageโ \nagainst Defendant Beaufort County only. Plaintiffsโ seventh cause of action is for assault against \nall Defendants. Plaintiff Mundayโs eighth cause of action is for battery against all Defendants.  \nPlaintiff Devine did not assert a claim for battery. \nDefendants argue that,  under the provisions of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act \n(โSCTCAโ), Defendant Beaufort County is not liable for intentional infliction of emotional harm \nor other intentional conduct by an employee. ECF No. 48-1 at 21โ22. They also contend that \nPlaintiffsโ claims for assault and Plaintiff Mundayโs claim for battery are barred by the SCTCA. \nId. at 23โ25. \nA โlossโ under the SCTCA includes โbodily injury, disease, death, or damage to tangible \nproperty, including lost wages and economic loss to the person who suffered the injury, disease, \nor death, pain and suffering, mental anguish, and any other element of actual damages recoverable \nin actions for negligence, but does not include the intentional infliction of emotional harm.โ See \nS.C. Code ยง 15-78-30(f). Additionally, a government entity is not liable for โemployee conduct \noutside the scope of his official duties or which constitutes actual fraud, actual malice, intent to \nharm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.โ See S.C. Code ยง 15-78-60(17).  \na.  Outrage (Count 6) \nWith regard to the claim for outrage, Plaintiffs agree that a โlossโ under the SCTCA does \nnot include โintentionalโ infliction of emotional harm and that a governmental entity is not liable \nfor employee conduct that constitutes an intent to harm. ECF No. 56 at 22. Indeed, there is no \ndispute here that intentional infliction of emotional harm is not a recoverable loss against Beaufort \nCounty under the SCTCA.  \n26 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 27 of 39\nHowever, Plaintiffs emphasize they have not alleged that any Defendantโs actions were \nโintentionalโ but, instead, contend they were โreckless.โ Indeed, the title of Count Six is โReckless \nInfliction of Emotional Distress (Outrage),โ and the allegations are limited to โrecklessโ conduct, \nnot โintentional conflict.โ ECF No. 12 at 18, ยถ 72 (the Defendants โrecklessly discriminated in \ntheir treatment of Plaintiffsโ), ยถ 77 (Defendantsโ conduct โwas recklessโ), ยถ 81 (โCounty should \nbe held liable to Plaintiffs . . . given [the individual Defendantsโ] reckless infliction of emotional \ndistressโ). Nor have Defendants pointed to any evidence that would prove otherwise, specifically \nthat the only evidence before the Court involves intentional and not reckless conduct.   \nWhile the cause of action is traditionally referred to as โoutrageโ or โintentional infliction \nof emotional distress,โ it includes reckless conduct. Specifically, โ[t]o recover for outrageโ\notherwise known as intentional infliction of emotional distressโa plaintiff must establish[, among \nother elements], the following: (1) the defendant intentionally  or recklessly inflicted severe \nemotional distress, or was certain, or substantially certain, that such distress would result from his \nconduct.โ Bass v. S.C. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 780 S.E.2d 252, 260 (S.C. 2015) (emphasis added) \n(quoting Argoe v. Three Rivers Behavioral Health, L.L.C., 710 S.E.2d 67, 74 (S.C. 2011) (citing \nHansson v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 650 S.E.2d 68, 70โ71 (S.C. 2007))); Ford v. Hutson, 276 \nS.E.2d 776, 778 (S.C. 1981).  \nDefendants argue for liberal construction of the SCTCA to bar this claim, citing to the \nstatute and numerous cases that have concluded the SCTCA bars outrage claims. ECF No. 48-1 at \n21โ23; see also S.C. Code Ann. ยง 15-78-20(f) (โ. . . limitation[s] on an exemption to the liability \nof the state . . . must be liberally construed in favor of limiting the liability of the state.โ). However, \nthe cases cited by Defendants involve claims for โintentionalโ infliction of emotional distress, \naddressing the intentional aspect of the cause of action. But South Carolina courts have made clear \n27 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 28 of 39\nthat while negligent conduct cannot give rise to an intentional infliction of emotional distress, \neither intentional or reckless conduct can. See, e.g., Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health All., 596 S.E.2d \n42, 48โ49 (S.C. 2004) (explaining that if defendant hospital โrecklessly or intentionally made \nrepeated and coercive efforts to separate a mother from her newborn infant, that might well \nconstitute  outrageous  conduct  that  .  .  .  conceivably  could  cause  severe  emotional  distress. \nHowever, the evidence presented at trial revealed that, while Hospitalโs staff arguably may have \nacted negligently in failing to follow certain policies, the staff did not act recklessly or intentionally \nin the extreme or outrageous manner described in the complaint,โ such that a directed verdict at \ntrial would have been appropriate) (emphasis added). \nAs Plaintiffs note, a plain reading of the SCTCA indicates that only intentional, not \nreckless, conduct is included, and โ[t]he Court is not required to examine statutory construction \nwhen the statute is plain and unambiguous.โ Thao v. Nationwide Affinity Ins. Co. of Am., No. 7:17-\nCV-02403-AMQ, 2018 WL 2971784, at *4 (D.S.C. June 13, 2018) โLegislative history only can \nbe resorted to for the purpose of solving doubt, not for the purpose of creating it.โ Id. (quoting \nTimmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commโn, 254 175 S.E.2d 805, 817 (S.C. 1970)). \nIn this case, Plaintiffs limited the allegations in their Amended Complaint to โrecklessโ \nconduct. Therefore, the undersigned cannot say, at this stage of the litigation, that the claims are \nbarred by the SCTCA. See Bass, 780 S.E.2d at 258, 261 (upholding general jury verdict against \nstate agency on SCTCA claims of gross negligence and outrage premised on reckless conduct). \nMoreover, Defendants do not present any other arguments in support of summary judgment on \nthis clam. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends denying Defendantsโ Motion for Summary \nJudgment on this claim, as set forth in Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint. \n \n28 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 29 of 39\nb.   Assault Claim (Count 7) and Battery Claim (Count 8) \nDefendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ claims for assault and on Plaintiff \nMundayโs battery claim.   \ni.  Devine \nPlaintiff Devine has withdrawn her assault claim and seeks leave to file a Second Amended \nComplaint removing her claim for assault. ECF No. 56 at 23. The undersigned recommends \ngranting Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff Devineโs claim for assault, \nincluding as to any Doe Defendants, and denying Plaintiffโs request to file an amended complaint \nto account for the removal, as it is unnecessary.   \nii.  Munday \nPlaintiff Munday has withdrawn her battery claim, though not her claim for assault. She \nseeks leave to file a Second Amended Complaint removing her claim for battery. The undersigned \nrecommends granting Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff Mundayโs claim \nfor battery, including as to any Doe Defendants, and denying Plaintiff Mundayโs request to file a \nSecond Amended Complaint, as it is unnecessary under the circumstances.   \nAs to Plaintiff Mundayโs claim for assault,17 it is based solely upon her pat down and not \nher strip search. She does not contend that either Defendant Foot or Grant assaulted her. Instead, \nMunday alleges in her Amended Complaint that โ[t]he BCDC Officer Defendantโs intentional \ncontact with Mundayโs genitalia served no penological purpose and was undertaken with the intent \n \n17 โAn โassaultโ is an attempt or offer, with force or violence, to inflict bodily harm on another or \nengage in some offensive conduct.โ Mellen v. Lane, 659 S.E.2d 236, 244 (S.C. Ct. App. 2008). \nโThe elements of assault are: (1) conduct of the defendant which places the plaintiff, (2) in \nreasonable fear of bodily harm.โ See id.; accord Jones v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, 456 S.E.2d 429, \n432 (S.C. Ct. App. 1995) (โ[A]n assault occurs when a person has been placed in reasonable fear \nof bodily harm by the conduct of the defendant.โ). \n \n29 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 30 of 39\nto gratify the officerโs sexual desire and/or to humiliate Munday.โ ECF No. 12 at ยถ 1. Plaintiff \nMunday contends that her testimony regarding her experience during her pat down makes it โboth \nabundant and clear that she was assaulted by an employee of the BCDC.โ ECF No. 56 at 23.   \nIn other words, Munday claims that, as to the pat down, the unnamed officer acted \nintentionally for her own personal, sexual gratification or to humiliate Plaintiff. Such conduct, \nhowever, is intentional and outside the scope of employment. Accordingly, pursuant to the \nprovisions of the SCTCA, it cannot support a claim under the SCTCA against Defendant Beaufort \nCounty. See Doe v. South Carolina State Budget & Control Bd., 494 S.E.2d 469, 473 (S.C. Ct. \nApp. 1997) (โIn the present case, no cogent argument can be made that Roberson was furthering \nthe business of his employer at the time he sexually assaulted Appellants.โ), affโd, 523 S.E.2d 457 \n(S.C. 1999).  \nMoreover, Plaintiff has not alleged, nor otherwise established, that either Defendant Foot \nor Grant assaulted her. Finally, as for any assault claim as to the unnamed Defendant BCDC \nOfficer, Plaintiffs have not identified the unnamed officer who allegedly conducted the pat down. \nWhile they have identified the names of three individuals they now want to add to the Amended \nComplaint as the โDoe Defendants,โ they have not argued or alleged that any of those individuals \nparticipated or were involved in the pat down of Plaintiff Munday. Accordingly, the undersigned \nrecommends granting Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment on this claim. \n  D. Plaintiffsโ Negligence Claims (Counts 5 and 9)  \nPlaintiffsโ Amended Complaint includes two negligence  claims:  (a) Count 5 against \nBeaufort County only for negligence per se, based upon S.C. Code ยง 24-5-90; and (b) Count 9 \nagainst all Defendants for negligence.  \n30 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 31 of 39\nPlaintiffs have indicated in their Response that they are withdrawing their claim for \nnegligence against Defendants Foot and Grant (Count 9), and they seek leave to file a Second \nAmended  Complaint  removing  these  Defendants  from  this  claim.  ECF  No.  56  at  29.  The \nundersigned recommends granting summary judgment to Defendants Foot and Grant on the \nnegligence  claim  and  denying  Plaintiffsโ  request  to  file  a  Second  Amended  Complaint  as \nunnecessary. \nThe remaining negligence (Count 9) and negligence per se (Count 5) claims against \nDefendant Beaufort County are addressed below. \n1.  Negligence Claim (Count 9)  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffsโ negligence claim should be dismissed because they have \nno evidence of any physical impact or injury, such that the claim is barred under South Carolina \nlaw. ECF No. 48-1 at 27โ31. In their Response, Plaintiffs cite to Padgett v. Colonial Wholesale \nDistrib. Co., 103 S.E.2d 265 (S.C. 1958), for the proposition that they can recover damages for the \nphysical manifestation of emotional injuries. ECF No. 56 at 25. Moreover, Plaintiffs contend that \nโthey were not questioned about these injuries or their physical manifestations during their \ndepositions but will offer testimony at trial on these issues.โ Id. Finally, Plaintiff Munday contends \nthat she offered testimony about โthe physical injury she suffered when assaulted by an employee \nof BCDC.โ ECF No. 56 at 26. \nAccording to Defendants, South Carolina case law subsequent to the Padgett case has made \nclear that damages for emotional distress are recoverable only in limited circumstances, including \nwhen it results from a physical injury or as bystander liability, and does not allow a cause of action \nfor negligently caused emotional distress outside of those scenarios. ECF No. 48-1 at 28โ31.  \nHowever, at least one South Carolina case seems to suggest damages may be recovered by a direct \n31 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 32 of 39\nvictim for bodily injuries suffered as a result of emotional and mental distress. See Bray v. \nMarathon Corp., 553 S.E.2d 477 (S.C. Ct. App. 2001) (โWe do agree with Bray in her assertion \nthat damages may be recovered in South Carolina for bodily injuries suffered as a result of \nemotional and mental distress caused by a defendantโs negligence in the absence of any physical \nimpact.โ), affirmed in part, reversed in part by 588 S.E.2d 93 (S.C. 2003).   \nRegardless, the undersigned need not resolve any dispute over the evolution of South \nCarolina state law because, even assuming South Carolina allows recovery under a negligence \ntheory for bodily injuries suffered as a result of emotional distress, Plaintiffs have not pointed to \nany evidence in the record to establish any bodily injury suffered as a result of emotional or mental \ndistress caused by Beaufort Countyโs or any of the Doesโ negligence. Plaintiffs indicate they were \nnot asked about these bodily injuries in their depositions and intend to present such evidence at \ntrial; however, they are opposing a summary judgment motion and must produce evidence now \nsufficient to create a material question of fact.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) (โA party asserting \nthat a fact . . . is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by citing to . . . the record, including \n. . . affidavits or declarations. . . .โ). \nWith regard to Plaintiff Mundayโs argument that her testimony supports evidence of bodily \nharm, the testimony at issue pertains to Plaintiff Mundayโs assault claim and purported intentional \nconduct by the officer in question, not any negligence claim.  Moreover, the deposition citations \nprovided reference physical contact with Plaintiff Munday but not physical injury. Indeed, Plaintiff \nMunday argues the physical contact by a BCDC Officer during the pat down put her in fear of \nbodily harm, not that she suffered bodily harm. See ECF No. 56 at 23โ24. \nAccordingly, the undersigned recommends granting Defendantsโ Motion for Summary \nJudgment on Plaintiffsโ negligence claim, as set forth in Count 9.  \n32 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 33 of 39\n2. Negligence Per Se Claim (Count 5)  \nPlaintiffsโ Count 5 asserts a negligence per se claim against Defendant Beaufort County, \nalleging a violation of South Carolina Code ยง 24-5-90, which states: โIt is unlawful to discriminate \nin the treatment of prisoners placed in the custody of the sheriff or local governing body. A \nviolation of this section is a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, the person convicted must be fined \nnot less than twenty-five dollars and imprisoned for not more than one year.โ See S.C. Code Ann. \nยง 24-5-90.  \nโNegligence per se is negligence arising from a defendantโs violation of a statute.โ Salley \nv. Heartland-Charleston of Hanahan, SC, LLC, No. 2:10-CV-00791, 2011 WL 2728051, at *3โ4 \n(D.S.C. July 12, 2011) (quoting Wogan v. Kunze, 623 S.E.2d 107, 117โ18 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005)). \nA statute must permit a private cause of action for plaintiffs to maintain a civil suit. โIn determining \nwhether a statute creates a private cause of action [in South Carolina], the main factor is legislative \nintent.โ Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Doe v. Marion, 645 S.E.2d 245, 248 (S.C. 2007)). \nโThe legislative intent to grant or withhold a private right of action for violation of a statute \nor the failure to perform a statutory duty is determined primarily from the language of the statute.โ \nId. (quoting Doe, 645 S.E.2d at 248). In this respect, the general rule is that a statute which does \nnot purport to establish a civil liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare \nof the public as an entity, is not subject to a construction establishing a civil liability. Id. When a \nstatute does not specifically create a private cause of action, one can be implied only if the \nlegislation was enacted for the special benefit of a private party. Id.  \nThe search for the legislative intent in South Carolina comports with the standards used for \ntesting federal rights of action. Id. (citing WilliamsโGarrett v. Murphy, 106 F. Supp. 2d 834, 842 \n(D.S.C. 2000)). Courts determining whether federal statutes grant a private cause of action โbegin \n33 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 34 of 39\nwith the presumption that if a statute does not expressly create a private cause of action, one does \nnot exist.โ Id. (quoting Ormet Corp. v. Oh. Power Co., 98 F.3d 799, 805 (4th Cir. 1996)). โBy \nnow, Congress is well aware of this presumption and how to provide private remedies.โ Id. \nNonetheless, courts may infer the existence of a private cause of action by applying the \nwell settled test which requires a determination of the following: (1) whether the plaintiff is one \nof the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted; (2) whether there is any indication \nof legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one; (3) whether \nimplication of a private remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative \nscheme; and (4) whether the cause of action sought is one traditionally relegated to state law. Id. \nat *3โ4 (citing Ormet Corp., 98 F.3d at 805).  \nIn this instance, Plaintiffsโ negligence per se claim under S.C. Code ยง 24-5-90 fails because \nthe regulation does not provide for a private cause of action. The parties have not identified any \ncourt that has addressed whether this statute creates a private right of action. However, the \nregulation lacks any language indicating the South Carolina legislature intended to authorize a \nprivate right of action. Although there is no language in the statute indicating its scope and purpose, \nthe statute does not appear to have been โenacted for the special benefit of a private party,โ as Doe \nrequires. Rather, the statute provides for the welfare of the general prison population. While \nPlaintiffs, during their time as inmates at BCDC, certainly fall within the class of individuals \ncovered by the statute, there is no indication of legislative intent to create a private right of action.18  \nIn fact, the statute criminalizes the conduct, suggesting an implicit intent to deny a civil remedy. \n \n18 In light of the ruling, the undersigned has not addressed Defendantsโ arguments under the public \nduty rule, which is a โrule of statutory construction which aids the court in determining whether \nthe legislature intended to create a private right of action for a statuteโs breach.โ Vaughan v. Town \nof Lyman, 635 S.E.2d 631, 634 (S.C. 2006) (recognizing that dispositive issue is not whether \nstatute creates a duty, but whether legislature intended to provide private right of action). \n34 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 35 of 39\nAnd, the cause of action sought by Plaintiffs in this case, creating a negligence claim based upon \nalleged  discriminatory  treatment,  is  one  traditionally  relegated  to  state  law,  whether  via  a \ntraditional common law negligence claim or a discrimination claim.  \nAccordingly, the undersigned recommends granting Defendant Beaufort Countyโs Motion \nfor Summary Judgment on Plaintiffsโ negligence per se claim, as set forth in Count 5.   \nE.   John and Jane Doe Defendants \nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit against Beaufort County, Philip Foot and Quandara Grant, as \nwell as ten โDoeโ defendants:  \n10. Defendants John Does 1-5 (collectively, โBCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ) were and \nare now responsible for the training, supervision, control, assignment, and discipline of \nboth sworn and civilian personnel of the County who work in, operate, administer, and \nmanage  BCDC,  and  for  the  formulation,  promulgation,  adoption,  application, \nadministration, and enforcement of the policies, rules, regulations, and practices of BCDC. \nAt this time, Plaintiffs do not know the identities and capacities of the BCDC Supervisory \nDefendants and therefore sue these Defendants by fictitious names. Plaintiffs will seek to \namend this Complaint to include one of more of the BCDC Supervisory Defendantsโ true \nnames and capacities when ascertained.  \n \n11. Defendants Jane Does 1-5 (collectively, โBCDC Officer Defendantsโ) were at all times \nrelevant herein employees of the County who worked as correctional officers at BCDC. At \nthis time, Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the BCDC Officer Defendants and \ntherefore sue these Defendants by fictitious names. Plaintiffs will seek to amend this \nComplaint to include one of more of the BCDC Officer Defendantsโ true names when \nascertained.  \n \nECF No. 12 ยถยถ 10โ11. Plaintiffs now seek leave to amend their Amended Complaint to name \nJacqueline Allmond, Aundrea Black, and Eloise Colson as individual defendants, indicating these \nindividuals conducted strip searches of female pre-class detainees. ECF No. 56 at 3.  \nThe undersigned is mindful that โ[l]eave to amend should be denied only if some reason \nexists for denial such as undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, undue prejudice to the opposing \nparty, or futility in allowing the amendment.โ See Federal Beef Processors v. CBS Inc., 858 F. \nSupp. 125, 126 (D.S.C. 1994). However, as noted above, the undersigned has recommended \n35 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 36 of 39\nsummary judgment as to Plaintiffsโ claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against  any individual \nDefendant,  including  the  Doe  Defendants.  See  Section  A,  supra.  Accordingly,  if  the \nrecommendation is adopted, any effort to add these three individuals as defendants in this case, \npremised upon their general involvement in conducting strip searches of female pre-classification \ndetainees, is moot. \nEven if Plaintiffsโ request for leave to amend were not moot, however, the request is denied \non the basis of undue delay and futility.  See Federal Beef Processors, 858 F. Supp. at 126. As \nDefendants have argued, Plaintiffs have known of the identities of these three individuals since at \nleast  November  2,  2020,  when  Defendants  served  discovery  responses  upon  Plaintiffs  that \nidentified them as officers involved in the strip searches. Under the Second Amended Scheduling \nOrder, the deadline for filing amendments to the pleadings was December 16, 2020.19 ECF No. \n10. Under the Third Amended Scheduling Order, discovery closed on February 27, 2022. ECF No. \n26. In short, this case has been pending for two years, discovery has closed, and the time to amend \nthe pleadings in this case has expired. Plaintiffs did not move to amend their pleading to identify \nthe individuals at issue until filing their Response in Opposition to Defendantsโ Motion for \nSummary Judgment on May 31, 2022.  Under the circumstances, any request to amend is denied \nbased upon undue delay.  \n \n19 โAlthough designation of a โJohn Doeโ defendant is not favored in the federal courts, it is \npermissible when the identity of the alleged defendant is not known at the time the complaint is \nfiled and plaintiff could identify the defendant through discovery.โ Treece v. S.C. Depโt of Mental \nHealth SCDMH, No. CIVA3:08-03909DCNJRM, 2010 WL 1254927, at *2 (D.S.C. Mar. 24, \n2010) (citing Schiff v. Kennedy, 691 F.2d 196, 197โ98 (4th Cir. 1982)). Such actions are only \npermissible against โreal, but unidentified, defendants.โ See Schiff, 691 F.2d at 197. โHowever, \nonce filed, it is incumbent upon a plaintiff to amend his pleadings to correctly identify the specific \nindividuals involved so that the matter may proceed to judgment.โ See Anderson v. Davies, No. \nCA 3:10-2481-CMC-JRM, 2012 WL 1038663, at *6 (D.S.C. Mar. 28, 2012). \n36 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 37 of 39\nMoreover, in light of the undersignedโs recommendations above, including to dismiss the \nยง 1983 claim against the individual Defendants based upon qualified immunity, Plaintiffsโ effort \nnow to identify certain John and Jane Doe Defendants largely appears futile.20 Under these \ncircumstances, the undersigned denies Plaintiffsโ request to amend their Amended Complaint in \nthis action to name the newly identified individuals as defendants in this case. \nRECOMMENDATION AND ORDER \nIt is RECOMMENDED that Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED, \nin part, and DENIED, in part.  It is RECOMMENDED that summary judgment be GRANTED: \n๏ท  to all Defendants, including any Doe Defendants, on Plaintiffsโ claims under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the Fourth Amendment (Count 1);  \n๏ท  to Defendants Foot and Grant, as well as Doe Defendants, on Plaintiffsโ claims \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment (Count 2);  \n๏ท  to all Defendants, including any Doe Defendants, on Plaintiffsโ claims under \nArticle I of the South Carolina Constitution (Count 3 and Count 4);  \n๏ท  to all Defendants, including any Doe Defendants, on Plaintiffsโ assault claim \n(Count 7);  \n๏ท  to all Defendants, including any Doe Defendants, on Plaintiff Mundayโs battery \nclaim (County 8);  \n๏ท  to Defendant Beaufort County on Plaintiffsโ negligence per se claim (Count 5); \nand  \n๏ท  to all Defendants, including any Doe Defendants, on Plaintiffsโ negligence claim \n(Count 9).   \n \n20 Indeed, the only potential cause of action in this case that could lie against any individual \ndefendant is for assault by the unidentified BCDC Officer. However, as set forth above, neither \nPlaintiff has alleged that any of the newly identified individuals โ Jacqueline Allmond, Aundrea \nBlack, and Eloise Colson โ committed an assault against them.   \n37 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 10/28/22      Entry Number 76       Page 38 of 39\nTo  the  extent  Plaintiffs  seek  to  amend  their  Amended  Complaint  to  comport  with  the \naforementioned recommendations, the undersigned RECOMMENDS denying the request for the \nreasons set forth above. \nIt is further RECOMMENDED that Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment be \nDENIED as to Plaintiffsโ claims against Defendant Beaufort County under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for \nviolations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count 2) and for \noutrage/reckless infliction of emotional distress (Count 6), as well as to Plaintiffsโ request for \nattorneysโ fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b) (Count 10).  \n  If these recommendations are adopted by the District Judge, the only claims remaining in \nthis case will be Plaintiffsโ claims, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, against \nBeaufort County under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment (Count 2), including the request for fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b), and \nPlaintiffsโ individual claims against Beaufort County for outrage/reckless infliction of emotional \ndistress (Count 6).  \n  Finally, it is ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ request to amend their Amended Complaint to \nname Jacqueline Allmond, Aundrea Black, and Eloise Colson as Defendants is DENIED.  \nIt is so RECOMMENDED and ORDERED. \nThe parties are referred to the Notice Page attached hereto.  \n \n            _________________________     \n            Molly H.

ECF No. 31. \nDefendants filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion (ECF No. 34), and Plaintiffs filed a Reply \n(ECF No. 36). After a hearing on Plaintiffsโ Motion, Defendants filed a supplemental Response in \nOpposition to the Motion (ECF No. 40),1 and Plaintiffs filed a Reply (ECF No. 42). The Motion \nis ripe for review.2  \nBACKGROUND \nThis case involves certain procedures used for female pre-classification3 detainees at the \nBeaufort County Detention Center (โBCDCโ or โCenterโ). Defendant Beaufort County operates \n \n1 Defendants contend that, at the hearing, Plaintiffs โconceded that they were seeking only issue \ncertification as to their equal protection claimโ and that the Court requested supplemental briefing \npertaining to Rule 23(c)(4) issue certification. ECF No. 40 at 1. While Plaintiffs conceded they \nwere seeking certification of their equal protection claim only, as briefed in their supporting \nmemoranda, they did not abandon their request for class certification under Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, nor did the Court rule out class certification. \n2 All pretrial proceedings in this case were referred to the undersigned pursuant to the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(f) (D.S.C.). Pursuant to \nthose provisions, this Report and Recommendation is entered for review by the District Judge. \n3 A pre-classification detainee is an inmate who has been arrested and placed or housed in an area \nat the detention center prior to going to bond hearing. ECF No. 34-1 at 20, ll. 7โ14. \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 2 of 23\nBCDC. ECF Nos. 12 ยถ 7, 13 ยถ 5. Defendant Philip Foot (โFootโ) is the Assistant County \nAdministrator for Public Safety Division who oversees the BCDC. ECF Nos. 12 ยถ 8, 13 ยถ 6. \nDefendant Quandara Grant (โGrantโ) is a Colonel and the director of the BCDC. ECF Nos. 12 ยถ 9, \n13 ยถ 6.   \nBCDCโs practice has been to house female pre-classification inmates in general population \nwhile placing male pre-classification inmates in a separate pre-classification cell outside of general \npopulation. ECF No. 31-3 at 14, ll. 2โ20. On February 27, 2015, BCDC began conducting a \nstrip/visual body cavity search (โstrip/vbc searchโ)4 on any pre-classification detainee placed in \ngeneral population. ECF Nos. 31-4 and 31-5. Accordingly, because female pre-classification \ndetainees are held in general population, BCDC conducts a strip/vbc search on every female pre-\nclassification detainee5 awaiting bond.6 ECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 6. BCDC did not, however, do so for \nsimilarly situated male pre-classification detainees prior to May 5, 2020, as they were housed in a \nseparate pre-classification cell outside of general population.7 There is generally no dispute \n \n4 The terms โstrip searchโ and โvisual body cavity searchโ (vbc) are used interchangeably, and at \ntimes, the term โstrip/vbc searchโ is used. A strip search involves partial or complete disrobing but \nnot necessarily a body cavity inspection while a visual body cavity search involves visual \ninspection of rectal, vaginal and other body cavities. Strip/vbc searches involve removal of all \nclothing to permit inspection of all body openings including ears, nostrils, anus, navel, and mouth. \nECF No. 31-2. They include a thorough inspection of the hair, crotch area, abdomen, soles of the \nfeet, armpits, and areas between the fingers and toes. Id.  \n5 โ[W]e instruct [females] to remove their clothing one item at a time and hand them to the booking \nofficer.โ ECF No. 31-3 at 3 (Black Dep. 18:25-19:2). โ[W]e have them lift their breasts, raise \ntheirโboth arms and then we have them bend over.โ (Id. 18:25-19:2). โThen we ask them to turn \naround and face the wall. We ask them to bend over at the waist, squat, reach back and grab their \ncheeksโ their butt cheeks, spread and cough three times hard from the stomach.โ (Id. 20:5-9). The \nguards can tell when someone is coughing because they watch the movement of the โvagina and \nthe anal.โ (Id. 34:12). \n6 Prior to February 27, 2015, women in pre-classification holding were not subject to strip searches, \nexcept pursuant to reasonable suspicion. ECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 5. \n7 According to Defendants, because of Covid protocols, as of May 5, 2020, pre-classification males \nare now also held in general population and, thus, also strip searched.  ECF No. 40-1 at ยถ 7. \n2 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 3 of 23\nbetween the parties that this practice was in effect at BCDC between February 27, 2015, and May \n5, 2020. See ECF No. 40 at 2. \nPlaintiff Cheryl Munday was arrested by the Bluffton Police Department on March 9, 2018, \nfor driving under the influence, which charge was later dismissed.  The arresting officer delivered \nher into the custody of BCDC officers for the booking process, where she underwent a full body \npat down, strip search and visual body cavity search. ECF Nos. 12 at ยถยถ 15โ19; 13 at ยถยถ 10, 12, \n13.  Plaintiff Margaret Devine was arrested by the Highway Patrol on January 17, 2019, for driving \nunder the influence; the charge was later dismissed. After Plaintiff Devine was transported to \nBCDC to begin the booking process, a BCDC officer initiated a full body pat down followed by a \nstrip search and visual body cavity search of her.  ECF Nos. 12 at ยถยถ 20โ24; 13 at ยถยถ 15, 18.  \nPlaintiffs have asserted several causes of action, for themselves and on behalf of others \nsimilarly situated. In the Motion before the Court, however, Plaintiffs seek to certify a class only \nfor their claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs claim that the procedures used by BCDC between February 27, \n2015 and May 5, 2020, to process the intake of similarly situated female and male pretrial \ndetainees, were different. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege these pre-classification women detainees \nwere all subjected to routine strip/vbc searches, while similarly-situated men in pre-classification \nstatus were not. ECF No. 12 ยถยถ 4, 25โ28.  Plaintiffs seek certification of a class based upon the \nequal protection rights of women whom the BCDC subjected to strip/vbc searches, which they \nallege was in violation of the Constitutions and laws of the United States and South Carolina.8  \n \n \n8 Plaintiffsโ Motion seeks to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure (damages), or, in the alternative, Rule 23(c)(4) (issue class), addressing the manner in \nwhich female pre-classification detainees are strip-searched. \n3 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 4 of 23\nCLASS DEFINITION \nThe proposed class is defined as: โFemale pre-classification detainees in the custody of \nBCDC who, upon their admission to BCDC,9 were strip/visual body cavity searched, while pre-\nclassification males were not, from February 27, 2015, until May 5, 2020.โ10  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nClass certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Rule 23(a) provides \nthat one or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all \nonly if: โ(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \nIn addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a), a class must also satisfy the requirements set \nforth in one of the three sub-parts of Rule 23(b). See Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., 348 F.3d 417, \n423 (4th Cir. 2003). Moreover, โRule 23 contains an implicit threshold requirement that the \nmembers of a proposed class be โreadily identifiable,โ โ often referred to as the โascertainabilityโ \n \n9 Plaintiffsโ proposed class originally included the phrase โor return to BCDC from outside of \nBCDCโ in addition to โupon their admission to BCDC.โ ECF No. 31 at 1. Plaintiffsโ counsel \nconceded at the hearing that phrase should be removed from the proposed class definition, as it \nwould include individuals who had been denied bond and were returned to BCDC and, as such, \nwould have been subject to a strip search, regardless of gender. \n10 Plaintiffs proposed an open-ended date for the class definition: โuntil the class period closes,โ \narguing that the class period โshould close at such time as the unconstitutional practice stops or \nwhen the Court so orders (e.g., at the time of a verdict).โ ECF No. 31-1 at 12. Defendants have \npresented evidence that as of May 5, 2020, male pre-classification detainees are housed in general \npopulation and strip searched, the same as the female pre-classification detainees.  ECF No. 40-1 \nat ยถ 7. Plaintiffs have not contested that date as the end of the alleged unequal practice at issue. \n4 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 5 of 23\nrequirement.11 EQT Prod.

Highland Industries, Inc., No. \n4:19-cv-02563-SAL, 2021 WL 4483035, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2021). Plaintiffs carry the burden \nof establishing that each of the requirements for class certification is satisfied. See generally In re \nZetia (Ezetimibe) Antitrust Litig., 7 F.4th 227, 236 n.6 (4th Cir. 2021); George v. Duke Energy \nRetirement Cash Balance Plan, 259 F.R.D. 225, 231 (D.S.C. 2009); Gariety v. Grant Thornton, \nLLP, 368 F.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2004) (โThe plaintiffs who propose to represent the class bear \nthe burden of demonstrating that the requirements of Rule 23 are satisfied.โ).  \nThough class certification should not be โconditioned on the merits of the case,โ the court \nmay โlook beyond the pleadings to the extent necessary to understand the claims, defenses, \nrelevant facts, and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the \ncertification issues.โ Clark v.

Ultimately, the court has broad discretion in deciding \nwhether to certify a class, which must be exercised within the framework of Rule 23. Thorn v. \nJefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 F.3d 311, 317 (4th Cir. 2006); Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 424; \nLienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 (4th Cir. 2001). \n \n \n11 Defendants mount several arguments regarding the proposed class definition. ECF No. 34 at 2โ\n7. To the extent those arguments are intended to dispute the threshold requirement that class \nmembers be readily identifiable, they are misplaced. The undersigned finds that the purported class \nmembers in this case are readily identifiable based upon the narrow definition of the class and for \nthe reasons addressed herein. The putative class members can be identified โwithout extensive and \nindividualized fact-finding.โ See EQT Prod. Co., 764 F.3d at 358 (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). To the extent any of Defendantsโ arguments regarding the class definition are \nintended to challenge, or can be interpreted as challenging, the requirements for class certification \nunder Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, they are addressed in detail \nbelow.  \n5 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 6 of 23\nLEGAL ANALYSIS \nPlaintiffs move for certification pursuant to Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, alleging that questions of law or fact common to the class members \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.  \nA.   Rule 23 Requirements for Certification.  \nThe four prerequisites set forth in Rule 23(a) are that: (1) the members of the class are so \nnumerous that joinder is impracticable; (2) one or more questions of law or fact are common; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the class representatives are typical of the claims or defenses of the \nclass; and (4) there is adequacy of representation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n1. Numerosity.  \nNumerosity means there are enough persons in the class that joinder of them all as plaintiffs \nin one case is impracticable. Lienhart, 255 F.3d at 146. No specific number is required. Brady v. \nThurston Motor Lines, 726 F.2d 136, 145 (4th Cir. 1984) (class with 74 persons; a much smaller \nclass is also sufficient); Cypress v. Newport News Gen. & Nonsectarian Hosp. Assโn, 375 F.2d \n648, 653 (4th Cir. 1967) (18 class members); In Re Kirschner Med. Corp. Sec. Litig., 139 F.R.D. \n74, 78 (D. Md. 1991) (explaining that โa class of as few as 25 to 30 members raises the presumption \nthat joinder would be impracticableโ); Bradford v. AGCO Corp., 187 F.R.D. 600, 604 (W.D. Mo. \n1999) (20 to 65 members). Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs have established numerosity, \n12 ECF No. 34 at 8, and the undersigned finds the numerosity requirement is met.  \n \n \n12 Defendant Grant testified that, on average, BCDC may have 20 females in general population. \nECF No. 31-3 at 14 (Grant Dep. 23:11โ16). \n6 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 7 of 23\n2. Commonality and Typicality \nCommonality and typicality are closely related and often overlapping requirements. Under \nthe former, the class must be united by a โcommon contentionโ that โis capable of classwide \nresolutionโwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.โ Dyer v. Air Methods Corps., No. \n9:20-CV-2309-DCN, 2021 WL 1840833, at *5 (D.S.C. May 7, 2021) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)). Similarly, โ[t]he premise of the typicality requirement is \nsimply stated: as goes the claim of the named plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.โ Id. (alteration \nin original) (quoting Broussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 340 (4th Cir. \n1998)).   \nDefendants address  the โcommonalityโ and โtypicalityโ factors together in summary \nfashion. ECF No. 34 at 2โ8. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs have not met their burden of \nestablishing commonality or typicality โbecause they cannot demonstrate that the proposed class \nmembers have all suffered a constitutional or statutory deprivation of privacy or the intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. Nor can they demonstrate that the class members have all suffered \na search that was performed in an unreasonable manner.โ Id. These arguments miss the mark. \nFirst, Defendantsโ arguments incorrectly assume Plaintiffs are moving to certify a class \nwith regard to each of the causes of action in the Amended Complaint, including specifically the \nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, Plaintiffs have limited their class \ncertification petition to their equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment and are not \nseeking certification of any of the other claims alleged in the Amended Complaint. Moreover, \nPlaintiffsโ class claim stems from the allegations of unequal treatment of men and women in \n7 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 8 of 23\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment, not any privacy concerns or variations in the manner or \nreasonableness of the searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment.   \nNotably, Plaintiffs allege, and Defendants acknowledge, that BCDC employed a system-\nwide practice of strip searching all female pre-classification detainees but not all similarly situated \nmale pre-classification detainees. There is a common pattern and practice that affects the class as \na whole, along with a common contention that is capable of class-wide resolution. The common \nfact in this case is that all female pre-classification detainees automatically undergo a strip/vbc \nsearch while male pre-classification detainees do not.13 Determination of the constitutionality of \nthe practice will resolve an issue that is central to the claim of the class. \nโCourts have consistently held that class actions challenging blanket strip search policies \nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2)โs commonality requirement.โ Young v. Cty. of Cook, No. 06-cv-552, 2007 \nWL 1238920, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 25, 2007); see also Dodge v. Cty. of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, \n181โ82 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (commonality existed where all members of the class contended that a \nstrip search policy existed, and that they were searched pursuant to the policy); Marriott v. Cty. of \nMontgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159, 172 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (same); Sutton v. Hopkins Cty., Ky., No. 03-\ncv-003,  2007  WL  119892,  *4  (W.D.  Ky.

Given  this  allegation,  the  existence  and \nconstitutionality of the countyโs policy, custom or practice are common questions.โ).  \nDefendants suggest that Plaintiffsโ claims are not typical of those in the class they want to \nrepresent because some putative class members would have been strip searched anyway, based \nupon reasonable suspicion.14 ECF No. 34 at 6. This purported difference, however, โwhile \narguably relevant as [a] defense[] to liability, do[es] not change the fact that this class action raises \nthe same basic claim and shares common questions of law.โ See Mack v. Suffolk Cty., 191 F.R.D. \n16, 23 (D. Mass. 2000). While Rule 23(a)(2) requires Plaintiff to show that common questions of \nlaw or fact exist and that class membersโ claims are not in conflict with one another, it does not \nrequire that class membersโ claims be identical. Id. (citing Guckenberger v. Boston University, 957 \nF. Supp. 306, 325 (D. Mass. 1997); Wilcox v. Petit, 117 F.R.D. 314, 316 (D. Maine 1987)); see \nalso Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 (finding claims of representative parties, while involving a more \ndetailed search than every member of the class, meet the typicality requirement as they are still \nbased upon a strip search conducted pursuant to a blanket policy).   \nIndeed, the โcommonality test has been characterized as a โlow hurdleโ that is โeasily \nsurmounted,โ where all that is required is the existence of โsome common question of law or fact.โโ \nCase v. French Quarter III LLC, No. 2:12-CV-02518-DCN, 2015 WL 12851717, at *4 (D.S.C. \nJuly 27, 2015) (quoting In re Prudential Sec. Inc. Lts.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 114 F.R.D. 48, 51 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1987)). โThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) does not require that all, or \neven most, issues be common, but only that common issues exist.โ Id. (citing Central Wesleyan \n \n14 To the extent Defendants also contend questions of whether reasonable suspicion existed to \nsearch each individual member of the class predominate over any other common issue in the case, \nthose arguments are addressed below with regard to the requirements under Rule 23(b)(3). \n9 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 10 of 23\nColl. v.

Grace & Co., 143 F.R.D. 628, 636 (D.S.C. 1993), affโd, 6 F.3d 177 (4th Cir. 1993).  \nPlaintiffs and the proposed class members share a common legal theory, i.e., that these searches \nwere unconstitutional because they were not based on a reasonable suspicion that the individuals \nsearched were concealing weapons or contraband but rather were conducted pursuant to a blanket \nstrip-search policy applied to female detainees but not to male detainees. The question of whether \nthe BCDC policy violates Plaintiffsโ rights under federal law is shared by all members of the \nputative class. Therefore, Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2) and (3) despite \nthe  possibility  of  a  varying  defense  to  liability  which  may  be  raised  regarding  particular \nindividuals. Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 23; Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172.   \n3. Adequacy.  \nThe adequacy requirement reviews whether the plaintiff has any interest antagonistic to the \nrest of the class, and whether counsel is qualified. S.C. Nat. Bank v. Stone, 139 F.R.D. 325, 330 \n(D.S.C. 1991); see also Case, 2015 WL 12851717, at *5 (citing Ganesh, LLC v. Computer Leasing \nCtrs., Inc., 183 F.R.D. 487, 490 (E.D. Va. 1998)). Plaintiffs must be able to adequately protect the \ninterests of the class members. Talley v. ARINC, Inc., 222 F.R.D. 260, 268โ69 (D. Md. 2004).  \nAs an initial matter, โ[t]he adequacy of Plaintiffโs counsel, like that of the individual \nPlaintiff, is presumed in the absence of specific proof to the contrary.โ Case, 2105 WL 12851717, \nat *5 (quoting S.C. Nat. Bank, 139 F.R.D. at 330โ31).  Defendants do not contest the qualifications \nor adequacy of Plaintiffsโ counsel, and the undersigned finds they are qualified to represent and \nprotect the interests of the purported class. \nDefendants argue, instead, that a fundamental conflict of interest exists between Plaintiffs \nand  putative  class  members  because  Plaintiffs  have  โmade  it  clear  that  liability  for  their \nexperiences of sexual assault โ which are not shared by the purposed class โ will predominate over \n10 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 11 of 23\nthe issue of equal protection.โ ECF No. 34 at 9. Defendants emphasize that both individual \nPlaintiffs also โplead causes of action in assault against all Defendants.โ Id. Merely asserting both \nindividual and class-related claims, however, does not create a conflict of interest. See Dyer, 2021 \nWL 1840833, at *8 (denying motion to strike class allegations on the face of the complaint alone, \nincluding where defendant argued plaintiff was not an adequate class representative based on \nhypothetical conflicts with other class members). \nPlaintiffs have asserted an equal protection claim, in addition to their assault claims.  \nDefendants have not explained how these additional allegations somehow create a conflict on the \nuniform application of the strip search policy as to all female pre-classification detainees but not \nto similarly situated male pre-classification detainees. In short, the purported conflict appears \nhypothetical, at best. See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 430 (โTo defeat the adequacy requirement of Rule \n23, a conflict โmust be more than merely speculative and hypothetical.โโ) (quoting 5 Mooreโs \nFederal Practice ยง 23.25[4][b][ii](2002)); Brown v.

Plaintiffs Meet Rule 23(b) Requirements for Certification  \nHaving satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs must also satisfy one of the \nrequirements of Rule 23(b). See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997).  \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3), which empowers the court to certify a class when \nโthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual members,โ and โa class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and \nefficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ Fed.

In weighing common issues against individual issues, โthe paramount concern for the \ncourt is not merely the number of individual inquiries that may be required, but rather whether the \nnature of the individual inquiries involved is so complex as to outweigh the nature of the common \nissues sought to be resolved by class treatment.โ Id.

ECF No. \n31-1 at 21โ22. Plaintiffs emphasize that the issue of liability is readily resolved, as they do not \nargue a number of individualized legal points or require a great deal of individualized proof to \nestablish most or all of the elements of their and the class membersโ legal causes of action. Id. \nRather, Plaintiffs point to a single policy that prompted one identified act or omission that serves \nas the basis for all claims. Id. They maintain that the strip search is a specific, identifiable action \npursuant to the same policy that is simply repeated over a period of time. Id. \nDefendants argue, however, that the individual issues of โfact, damages and standingโ will \npredominate in the case, such that the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) is not met.  See \nECF No. 40 at 5โ7. They cite to Windham v. American Brands, Inc., 565 F.2d 59, 68 (4th Cir. \n1977) for the proposition that where there is an โoverwhelming large number of individual claimsโ \npresenting  the  โstaggering  problems  of  logistics,โ  then  the  โdamage  aspect  of  (the)  case \npredominate[s]โ such that the case is โunmanageable as a class action.โ Id. at 5.   \nHowever, โ[w]hile Windham might well support this courtโs decision should it deny class \ncertification based on management concerns, it does not mandate that result.

Plaintiffsโ equal protection claim is \nnot complex like multipronged antitrust claims. Here, Plaintiffs point to a single, identifiable \nunconstitutional practice that serves as the basis of their equal protection claim. Thus, liability \nshould be readily resolved across the class because all putative class members were subject to the \nsame allegedly unconstitutional practice.  \nThe core issue of whether the policies and practices relating to strip searches at BCDC \nwere lawful is the predominant issue that binds the class together in this case. โGenerally, common \nquestions of law or fact predominate if they represent a significant part of the case and can be \nresolved for all class members in a single adjudication.โ Case, 2015 WL 12851717, at *5 (citing \nHaywood v. Barnes, 109 F.R.D. 568, 581 (E.D.N.C. 1986)). โThe mere fact that questions peculiar \nto  each  individual  member  of  the  class  action  remain  after  the  common  questions  of  the \ndefendantโs liability have been resolved does not dictate the conclusion that a class action is \nimpermissible.โ Powers v. Hamilton Cty. Pub. Def. Commโn, 501 F.3d 592, 619 (6th Cir. 2007) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nOther class action lawsuits alleging unconstitutional strip searches align with the concept \nespoused in Crane and support a finding of predominance in this case. See, e.g., In re Nassau Cty. \nStrip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 228 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that โwhen plaintiffs are allegedly \naggrieved by a single policy of defendants, such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case \npresents precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suitedโ) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted); Jones v. Murphy, 256 F.R.D. 519, 524 (D. Md. 2009) (โ[T]he \ncourt is not convinced that individualized determinations regarding reasonable suspicion will \n14 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 15 of 23\npredominate or cause the class litigation to become unmanageable. Rather, whether and for how \nlong a strip search custom or policy existed, the constitutionality of that policy, and to whom the \npolicy was applied are  the predominant  liability issues in the case of each proposed class \nmember.โ) (internal citations omitted); see also Moyle v. Cty. of Contra Costa, C-05-02324 JCS, \n2007 WL 4287315, at 22 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2007) (โThe core issue of whether the policies and \npractices relating to strip searches . . . were lawful is the predominant issue that binds the class \ntogether in this case and is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).โ).   \nDefendants also posit that damage determinations are likely to differ as between plaintiffs \nbecause the impact of the strip searches on the individual plaintiffs will diverge widely. Even if \nindividual damages do vary, individual damage calculations generally do not defeat a finding that \ncommon issues predominate. See Stillmock v. Weis Markets, Inc., 385 F. Appโx 267, 272 (4th Cir. \n2010) (finding that district court erred in concluding that individual issues of damages would \npredominate over issues common to the class); Case, 2015 WL 12851717, at *6 (citing Gunnells, \n348 F.3d at 427); Powers, 501 F.3d at 619 (โCases alleging a single course of wrongful conduct \nare particularly well-suited to class certification.โ). โIn fact, Rule 23 explicitly envisions class \nactions with such individualized damage determinations.โ Case, 2015 WL 12851717, at *6. \nโQuantitatively, almost by definition there will always be more individual damages issues than \ncommon liability issues. Qualitatively, however, liability issues may far exceed in complexity the \nmore mundane individual damages issues.โ Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see \nGunnells, 348 F.3d at 429.  The common questions of law and fact in this instance have a direct \nimpact  on  every  class  memberโs  effort  to  establish  liability  and  on  every  class  memberโs \nentitlement to relief.  \n15 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 16 of 23\nDefendants further argue that there may be factual differences because, for some putative \nclass members, an officer could have had probable cause to strip search the detainee.15 ECF No. \n34 at 6. To be clear, Defendants do not argue those instances would be numerous, nor is there any \nevidence before the Court that strip searches based on particular episodes of probable cause are or \nwere frequent.16 Other courts have rejected this theory in strip search cases. See In re Nassau Cty. \nStrip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 230 (โFurther, as the District Court recognized, any such \nreasonable suspicion inquiries will be de minimis. . . . In light of the pervasive character of the \ncommon liability issues and the admittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability issues, we \nconclude that the District Court erred by holding that individual liability issues predominated over \ncommon ones[.]โ); Tardiff v. Knox Cty., 365 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004) (โIf there was in fact a rule, \ncustom or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category, then it is a \nfair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip searched on this basis. There might yet be some \nnumber as to whom defensible individual judgments to strip search were actually made or could \nhave been madeโtwo different situations with different legal implications; but whoever has the \nburden of identifying such persons, they may well not be numerous.โ). The undersigned agrees \nthat, in this case, any individual factual issues over whether a pre-classification detainee would \nhave been strip searched for reasonable suspicion does not predominate over the common issues \nraised by the blanket strip search policy. \n \n15 Defendants also argue that any pre-trial detainees who return to BCDC after a bond hearing \nwould automatically be strip searched, such that including such female pre-trial detainees in the \nclass definition would defeat the commonality and typicality requirements.  ECF No. 34-6.  As \nnoted above, Plaintiffs agree to removing any such individuals from the proposed class, and the \ndefinition has been modified accordingly.   \n16 Plaintiffs argue that โBCDC recently produced records which identify which males and females \nwere strip searched based on reasonable suspicion. Only a tiny portion of females were strip \nsearched on reasonable suspicion.โ ECF No. 42 at 3 (emphasis in original).  No such records are \nbefore the Court.    \n16 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 17 of 23\nMoreover, in weighing common issues against individual issues, โ[t]he paramount concern \nfor the court is not merely the number of individual inquiries that may be required, but rather \nwhether the nature of the individual inquiries involved is so complex as to outweigh the nature of \nthe common issues sought to be resolved by class treatment.โ Naparala, 2016 WL 3125473, at \n*10 (quoting Brooks v. GAF Materials Corp., No. 8:11-cv-00983, 2012 WL 5195982, at *8 \n(D.S.C. Oct. 19, 2012)). The inquiries and information that may be needed to make a reasonable \nsuspicion determination on a limited number of putative class members is not a complex inquiry \nand certainly does not outweigh the nature of the common issues sought to be resolved by class \ntreatment in this case. \nDefendants also emphasize that โ[a]nother individual inquiry that the Court would need to \nconduct would be to ascertain which class membersโ claims fall outside the statute of limitations.โ \nECF No. 40 at 7. The parties agree that South Carolinaโs three-year statute of limitations applies \nto Plaintiffsโ claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.17 See Owens v. Baltimore City Stateโs Attโys. Off., 767 \nF. 3d 379, 388 (4th Cir. 2014) (explaining that the most analogous state-law cause of action for \nยง 1983 suits is a personal-injury suit); S.C. Code Ann. ยง 15-3-535 (2005) (three-year statute of \nlimitations). The parties further agree that a claim accrues โwhen the plaintiff possesses sufficient \nfacts about the harm done to him that reasonable inquiry will reveal his cause of action.โ Nassim \nv.

U.S. Home Corp., 961 F.3d 301, 307 \n \n17 Although the South Carolina statute of limitations applies, the matter of when a cause of action \nhas accrued under ยง 1983 is a question of federal law. See McDonough v. Smith, ___ U.S. ____, \n139 S. Ct. 2149, 2155 (2019) (โAlthough courts look to state law for the length of the limitations \nperiod, the time at which a ยง 1983 claim accrues is a question of federal law, conforming in general \nto common-law tort principles.โ (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Nassim v.

Defendants contend that individualized, fact-intensive determinations \nwill have to be made as to whether class members knew or should have known about BCDCโs \nallegedly unconstitutional practice by March 6, 2017. The undersigned disagrees.   \nIndeed, in this case, it is difficult to imagine how the exercise of reasonable diligence would \nplace a putative class member on notice of her potential claim during the two-year period between \nFebruary 27, 2015 (the date the policy was implemented) and March 6, 2017. All female pre-\nclassification detainees were strip searched and confined to BCDCโs general population, while all \nmales were held in a special pre-class holding cell. There is no evidence before the Court that \nmales and females were permitted to communicate with one another while detained, nor that \nBCDC  alerted  any  putative  Plaintiff  to  its  new  strip  search  policy  on  February  27,  2015. \nDefendants have not provided any evidence or argument as to how Plaintiffs knew or should have \nknown of their potential claims. Notwithstanding that it appears likely that most putative class \nmembers between February 27, 2015, and March 6, 2017, should not have known of a potential \nclaim, the undersigned finds that the statute of limitations defenses at issue here do not defeat the \npredominance of common questions. \nUltimately,  although  affirmative  defenses  may  arise  and  may  affect  different  class \nmembers differently, these occurrences do not compel a finding that individual issues predominate \nover common ones in this instance. A sufficient constellation of common issues binds class \n18 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 19 of 23\nmembers together, such that the purported variations in the sources and application of defenses \nraised by Defendants does not foreclose class certification. \n2. Superiority.  \nSuperiority requires that use of a class action be โsuperior to other available methods for \nfairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Superiority โdepends \ngreatly on the circumstances surrounding each case,โ and the โrule requires the court to find that \nthe  objectives  of  the  class-action  procedure  really  will  be  achieved  in  the  particular \ncase.โโ Stillmock, 385 F. Appโx at 274 (quoting 7AA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & \nMary Kay Kane, Fed. Prac. & Proc. ยง 1779 (3d ed. 2005)). When making this determination, the \nCourt should โnot contemplate the possibility that no action at all might be superior to a class \naction.โ Thomas v. FTS USA, LLC, 312 F.R.D. 407, 425 (E.D. Va. 2016) (citation and internal \nquotations marks omitted). Factors the court should consider include: โ(A) the class membersโ \ninterests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent \nand nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; \n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular \nforum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing the class action.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(3)(A)โ\n(D). Ultimately, โ[t]he goal is to ensure that class certification occurs only when economy and \nefficiency are reasonably likely to result.โ Ganesh, 183 F.R.D. at 491.  \nHere, each of the foregoing factors favors class certification. There is no prevalence of \nindividual issues and little indication that class members prefer to maintain separate actions.18 \n \n18 The undersigned notes five individual lawsuits have been filed subsequent to this one: 9:22-cv-\n00480-DCN-MHC;  9:22-cv-00482-DCN-MHC;  9:22-cv-00483-DCN-MHC;  9:22-cv-00484-\nDCN-MHC; and 9:22-cv-00485-DCN-MHC. Counsel for Plaintiffs in this action is the same for \nthe plaintiffs in these other lawsuits, and the parties have suggested consolidating the cases.   \n19 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 20 of 23\nSecond, there is no existing litigation with which this case might interfere. Third, under the current \nfacts, the use of the class action device will result in conservation of judicial resources and achieve \neconomies of time, effort, and expense. The class action format is designed for this very situation \nwhere individuals seek to vindicate โthe rights of groups of people who individually would be \nwithout effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.โ Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at \n617 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). โThe policy at the very core of the class action \nmechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any \nindividual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.โ Id. (quoting Mace v. Van Ru Credit \nCorp., 109 F.3d 338, 344 (7th Cir. 1997)). โA class action solves this problem by aggregating the \nrelatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someoneโs (usually an attorneyโs) \nlabor.โ Id.  \nDefendants, citing Parker v. Asbestos Processing, LLC, No. 0:11-CV-01800-JFA, 2015 \nWL 127930, at *14 (D.S.C. Jan. 8, 2015), argue that class certification is not superior to other \navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating Plaintiffsโ claims. ECF No. 40 at 9.  \nHowever, the facts in Parker are not analogous to the facts in this case. Indeed, in concluding that \nclass certification did not meet Rule 23(b)(3)โs โsuperiorityโ requirement, the Parker court pointed \nto the โuniqueโ circumstances of the controversy at issue that would make managing a class action \nparticularly difficult: \nResolution of [the issues of proximate cause and damages in a legal malpractice \ncase alleging failure to advise clients of workersโ compensation rights] raises the \nall-important question of whether a plaintiff had, at the time, a viable workersโ \ncompensation  claim.  Answering  this  question  would  involve  a  fact-intensive \ninquiry regarding questions such as: \nโข Whether the plaintiff had asbestosis caused by his employment; \nโข Whether the plaintiff was โdisabledโ for workersโ compensation purposes; \nโข Whether the plaintiff incurred lost wages; \n20 \n \n\n9:20-cv-02144-DCN       Date Filed 05/02/22      Entry Number 49       Page 21 of 23\nโข Whether the plaintiffโs claim was timely; and \nโข Whether the plaintiff โcontractedโ asbestosis within two years of the last \nexposure as required by South Carolina law. \nTo use the vernacular, to allow this case to proceed as a class action for certain \nsimple and relatively straightforward common threshold issues [regarding whether \nthe disclaimer in the contract of representation sufficiently advised the plaintiffs of \ntheir rights regarding workersโ compensation] would be to allow the tail to wag the \ndog. The prospect of litigating, in one case, nearly 16,000 claims of workersโ \ncompensation disability issues, as well as damages, with only minimal advantage \ngained from the resolution of the threshold common issues, leads this Court to \nconclude, under Rule 23(b)(3)(D) that the โlikely difficulties in managing a class \nactionโ render the class action device inferior to other available methods in this \ncase. \n2015 WL 127930, at *15. That is not the case here. \nFor most strip search claimants, class status is likely not only the superior means, but \narguably the only feasible one to establish liability and damages. Other courts have observed that \nsuch concerns are particularly proper where, as here, the putative strip search class will likely \ninclude class members who are unable to litigate these cases individually. See Gwiazdowski v. Cty. \nof Chester, 263 F.R.D. 178, 190 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (โ[C]ourts have concluded in similar โstrip search \npolicyโ cases that recovery by each putative class member would likely be small, and that each \nmember would have little incentive to pursue its claims individually[.]โ); see also In re Nassau \nCty. Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 230 (โ[W]ithout class notification, most putative class \nmembers will not even know that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights.โ); Tardiff, \n365 F.3d at 7 (โIt is enough for the superiority determination here that for most strip search \nclaimants, class status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one . . . \nto establish liability and perhaps damages.โ); Buzzarro v. Ocean Cty., No. CIV.A. 07-5665(FLW), \n2009 WL 1617887, at *17 (D.N.J. June 9, 2009) (finding that โdue to the nature of Plaintiffsโ \nclaims, most of the proposed class members would not independently assert their claimsโ).
