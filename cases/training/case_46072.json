    "summary": "<p>Undocumented immigrants allege that Suffolk County law enforcement unlawfully detained immigrants past their release dates based on ICE detainers, raising key questions about local enforcement of immigration laws.</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, 2017, an undocumented immigrant brought this case against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the County of Suffolk, and the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office (SCSO) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Plaintiff alleged that Suffolk County held him longer than constitutionally permitted for the sole purpose of serving ICE's administrative convenience, in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments and New York state law. The case was initially assigned to Judge Joseph F. Bianco and Magistrate Judge Arlene R. Lindsay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff was arrested by SCSO for traffic violations on April 23, 2017. The following day, Plaintiff's cousin posted his bail. The same day, ICE issued a detainer request to SCSO and an administrative warrant for Plaintiff. Rather than releasing Plaintiff, SCSO held him without explanation until April 26, 2017 when they transferred custody to ICE. This was consistent with SCSO's official policy of honoring ICE detainer requests and corresponding warrants, in place from December 2, 2016 and November 15, 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding another undocumented migrant who had been detained by SCSO for ICE's convenience. This second Plaintiff had been arrested, pled guilty to a disorderly conduct violation, and was sentenced to time served on August 18. Despite receiving a sentence of time served, Plaintiff remained detained by SCSO due to an ICE detainer and administrative warrant. He was subsequently transferred that night to ICE custody and later released on bond in January 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint also included a writ of habeas corpus for the added Plaintiff who remained in custody at the time of filing. Plaintiffs requested that the Court, under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241, order Defendants to release the added Plaintiff and other members of the proposed class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 9, 2018, the second Plaintiff was arrested for a second time on a separate charge and taken into SCSO custody. ICE again sent a detainer request for Plaintiff. Plaintiff took a plea agreement on March 30. However, he remained in SCSO custody and was transferred to ICE custody per the detainer on April 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 9, 2017, the DHS and ICE officials (the Federal Defendants) and the SCSO and Suffolk County officials (the County Defendants) filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Federal Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs lacked standing, cooperation with detainers is lawful under federal and state law, and there was no basis to Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim. The County Defendants similarly argued that the statutory scheme of immigration detainers is lawful. The County Defendants also argued that Plaintiffs' detentions were supported by probable cause and that Plaintiffs had failed to state any due process violations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 28, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a consent motion to dismiss the Federal Defendants.&nbsp;On January 2, 2018, Judge Bianco granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice as to all Federal Defendants. Details as to why the motion was filed or granted are unclear to the Clearinghouse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 29, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. This complaint was only operative against the County Defendants. It alleged that SCSO had a policy of unquestioning compliance with ICE detainer requests that violated Plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights as well as the First Article of the New York Constitution. Plaintiffs also added declaratory and injunctive relief for the second Plaintiff and others similarly situated under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 30, 2019, the case was reassigned to Chief Judge Roslynn R. Mauskopf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2020, the County Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to Plaintiff's second amended complaint. This motion was terminated for failure to comply with the court's rule on fully briefing the motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 3, 2020, the United States filed a statement of interest and memorandum as to why the SCSO's cooperation with ICE was lawful. The US argued that Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because they lacked standing to raise claims on behalf of themselves or anyone else. Standing requires that individuals demonstrate that that they are likely to suffer future injury from the challenged conduct and Plaintiffs, the US argued, had failed to allege any likelihood that they would be subject to ICE detainer by SCSO again. The US further argued that even if the court had jurisdiction, Plaintiffs failed to state a claim because cooperation with ICE detainers is consistent with the INA even with a lack of a formal 287(g) agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2020, the New York Attorney General's office similarly filed a motion to submit an amicus curiae brief. In their memorandum in support of their motion to leave to file the brief, New York argued that ICE detainers were not lawful under federal or state law. New York further argued that both Defendants and the United States misunderstood state law and the scope of authority given to state law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 8, 2020, the County Defendants filed a new motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2021, the case was reassigned to Judge William F. Kuntz, II.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 30, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify Plaintiffs' class. Plaintiffs originally asked that the class be defined as all persons who were detained by SCSO and held under ICE detainer from January 1, 2014 until the present day. In an October 5, 2021 letter, Plaintiffs changed the proposed definition to limit the class to all persons who were detained by SCSO on ICE detainer from January 1, 2014 to November 15, 2018 after consulting with the County Defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 12, 2021, the County Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The same day, Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Both motions were denied by Judge Kuntz on May 9, 2022 without an opinion and without prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 31, 2022, Magistrate Judge Lindsay issued a Report and Recommendation, recommending that the Court grant Plaintiffs' motion for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Kuntz granted this motion on July 1, 2024 and directed both parties to refile their cross-motions for summary judgment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 2, 2025, Judge Kuntz issued a decision and order. 2025 WL 481723. In that decision, he granted Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to liability. The Court found that ICE detainers are civil, not criminal, in nature and do not constitute probable cause unless local law enforcement has specific authorization through a 287(g) agreement. New York courts had also recognized that New York law does not allow local law enforcement to effectuate civil immigration arrests. Since Plaintiffs were held past their lawful release times based on ICE detainers alone, their detention constituted a new seizure without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the First Article of the New York Constitution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Kuntz also granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims. While the court found that the SCSO policy was unlawful, it did not find that it rose to the \"shock the conscience\" level necessary for substantive due process claims. The court also reasoned that these claims were duplicative of the Fourth Amendment claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Kuntz lastly denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' other claims (Fourth Amendment and&nbsp;<em>Monell&nbsp;</em>municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983). The Court found that all the elements of <em>Monell&nbsp;</em>liability were met since (i) Suffolk County had an official policy of honoring ICE detainers without a 287(g) agreement; (ii) the policy itself directly caused the unconstitutional seizures, and (iii) the policy was not mandated by federal law&mdash;the County chose to enforce detainers. As to the Fourth Amendment claim, the Court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment because the ICE detainers were not based on probable cause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a notice of appeal of the liability ruling on February 11, 2025, and a motion to stay further proceedings in the district court on February 14, while plaintiffs sought to continue towards trial on remedies. On February 18, Judge Kuntz granted a stay of further trial court proceedings until the Second Circuit resolved the appeal on liability. Also on February 18, the plaintiffs filed a motion in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the partial summary judgment ruling on liability is a nonappealable, non-final order. Both that motion and the merits of the appeal are pending disposition.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

The case was heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, presided over by Judge William F. Kuntz, II. The Plaintiffs argued that SCSO’s policy of honoring ICE detainers without a formal 287(g) agreement violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as the New York State Constitution. On January 2, 2025, the court granted summary judgment for Plaintiffs on their Fourth Amendment and state law claims, ruling their detentions were unconstitutional, but dismissed their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims.

DeMarco, and other individuals in charge to be identified (collectively, “Defendants”), \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 2 of 23 PageID #:\n236\nand allege as follows: \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n1.  By  this  amended  complaint  (“Complaint”),  Plaintiffs-Petitioners  (“Plaintiffs”) \nchallenge ICE’s policy and practice of issuing detainers requesting that federal, state, and local law \nenforcement agencies continue to detain individuals well after any other basis for custody has \nexpired, simply for the administrative convenience of ICE.  ICE’s statutory authority to issue \ndetainers without a judicially authorized arrest warrant is expressly limited, as set forth in 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(d), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), and 8 U.S.C. 1357(a), to situations other than those involved in the \ninstant case.  As detailed below, ICE’s issuance of these detainers (“ICE detainers”) regularly \nexceeds its statutory authority. \n2.  By this Complaint, Plaintiffs also challenge the policy and practice of the SCSO and \nits officials of complying with these ICE detainers by detaining individuals without judicial \nauthorization well past the time when they were due to be released, policies that led to Plaintiffs \nbeing so harshly, and unjustly, deprived of their freedom, their families and their livelihoods, all \ndeprivations they seek to remedy by this action.  These detentions, unsupported by a judicial \ndetermination of probable cause and without due process protections, violate Plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and under the First \nArticle of the New York Constitution. \n3.  On or about April 27, 2017, Defendant United States Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) obtained custody of Plaintiff Mr. Orellana, in knowing reliance on an \nunconstitutional scheme deployed by Defendant Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office (“SCSO”), at \nICE’s request, to maintain custody over Mr. Orellana beyond his scheduled release date simply for \nICE’s  administrative  convenience,  without  the  required  statutory,  judicial,  or  constitutional \nauthority to do so.   \n2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 3 of 23 PageID #:\n237\n4.  Though  Mr.  Orellana  paid  the  bail  set  by  the  local  district  court,  the  SCSO \nunlawfully extended his detention to transfer custody of his person to ICE, in whose custody he has \ncontinuously remained to date. \n5.  Similarly, on July 2, 2017, Plaintiff Mr. Hernandez was arrested by the Suffolk \nCounty Police and remanded to the custody of the SCSO.  Upon information and belief, Defendant \nICE subsequently issued a detainer requesting that SCSO maintain custody over Mr. Hernandez for \nan additional 48 hours beyond his scheduled release date, without the required statutory, judicial, \nor constitutional authority to do so.  Upon disposition of Mr. Hernandez’s criminal case, at which \ntime he should have been released, he was instead remanded back to the custody of SCSO.  Upon \ninformation and belief, ICE will take custody of him in the next 48 hours, absent relief from this \nCourt. \n6.  ICE justified its detainer requests based solely on its initiation of investigations to \ndetermine whether Plaintiffs were subject to removal from the United States.  ICE did not \naccompany Plaintiffs’ detainers with a judicial arrest warrants or final removal orders. \n7.  On information and belief, ICE has no procedures in place to ensure that the subjects \nof detainers receive adequate notice of the detainers’ terms.  Moreover, even though the detainer \nform states that “the alien must be served with a copy of this form,” neither ICE nor SCSO provided \nMr. Orellana with a copy of his ICE detainer until several days after it was issued. When Mr. \nOrellana did finally receive a copy of his detainer, it was written only in English, a language Mr. \nOrellana does not speak.  As of the filing of this Amended Complaint, Mr. Hernandez has not been \nprovided with a copy of his detainer at all.  Nor did ICE provide Plaintiffs with any practical means \nto challenge the ICE detainers lodged against them. \n3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 4 of 23 PageID #:\n238\n8.  Plaintiffs seek damages under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(a), under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, \nand under the First Article of the New York Constitution for the violation of their rights. \n9.  Plaintiff Mr. Hernandez also seeks on his behalf and on behalf of similarly situated \nindividuals, who have immigration detainers lodged against them, declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(a), under the Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth \nAmendments for the ongoing violation of their rights, or, in the alternative, habeas corpus relief. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.  This Court also \nhas supplemental jurisdiction over this action’s New York Constitution claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367 because those claims are so related to the claims arising under the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United \nStates Constitution. \n11.  This Court has authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n12.  This Court has authority to grant injunctive relief in this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 702 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n13.  Alternatively, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2241. \n14.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because \na substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred, and continue \nto occur, in this District. \n15.  Venue is also proper in this judicial district because Plaintiff resides in this District. \n4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 5 of 23 PageID #:\n239\nPARTIES \n16.  At the time this action was commenced, Plaintiff Joaquin Orellana Castaneda was a \n34-year old resident of Suffolk County detained at the Bergen County Jail in Hackensack, New \nJersey under the authority of ICE. \n17.  Seeking to escape crime and violence in his native country, Mr. Orellana made his \nway to the United States in 2005, and settled in Suffolk County, New York.  He works at a nursery \nthat sells plants wholesale to retail stores, and lives modestly so as to send as much of his earnings \nas possible to family members back home. \n18.  Mr. Orellana was arrested in the early morning hours of April 23, 2017 in Central \nIslip, New York, for violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. That same day, Mr. Orellana was \nbrought before a Suffolk County judge, who set Mr. Orellana’s bail at $1000 and remanded him to \nthe custody of the SCSO.  Mr. Orellana spent the remainder of the day and night at Yaphank \nCorrectional Facility (“Yaphank”) in Yaphank, New York.   \n19.  The next day, April 24, 2017, Mr. Orellana was interviewed by ICE agents while \nunder SCSO custody at Yaphank.  Mr. Orellana was told that if he paid his bail, then he would be \nreleased and would eventually have to appear at an immigration hearing.  That same day, Mr. \nOrellana’s cousin paid Mr. Orellana’s bail.  A true and correct copy of the bail receipt is attached \nhereto as Exhibit A. \n20.  However, no one informed Mr. Orellana that his bail had been paid, and SCSO \ncontinued to hold Mr. Orellana at Yaphank pursuant to an ICE detainer after his bail had been paid. \nSCSO did not serve Mr. Orellana with a copy of the detainer at that time. A true and correct copy \nof Mr. Orellana’s detainer and accompanying I-200 administrative warrant is attached hereto as \nExhibit B.  Though it is dated April 24, 2017, the certificate of service at the bottom is blank.   \n5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 6 of 23 PageID #:\n240\n21.  On April 25, 2016, while Mr. Orellana remained at Yaphank, a member of SCSO \ntold him that there was a change in his paperwork, and gave no further explanation.  The next day, \nApril 26, 2017, Mr. Orellana was transferred from Yaphank to the Riverhead Correctional Facility \n(“Riverhead”) in Riverhead, New York.   \n22.  Upon information and belief, on or about April 27, 2017 (and certainly well after \nMr. Orellana should have been released from custody due to the payment of his bail), Mr. Orellana \nwas transferred into ICE’s custody, and taken from Riverhead to ICE’s Varick Street Detention \nCenter (“Varick Street”) in New York, New York. There, Mr. Orellana was questioned by ICE \nagents and given forms to sign.  Those forms included another copy of the I-200 warrant that had \naccompanied his detainer, but this time the I-200 was dated (by the ICE officer, not by Mr. Orellana) \nApril 26, 2017. A true and correct copy of this second I-200 is attached hereto as Exhibit C. Later \nthat night, Mr. Orellana was transferred from Varick Street to the Bergen County Jail. \n23.  At the time this action was commenced, Plaintiff German Hernandez Argueta was a \n22-year-old resident of Suffolk County, detained by the SCSO. \n24.  Mr. Hernandez fled his home due to gang threats and violence.  He left his mother \nand sisters in 2014 at the age of 19, and came to live with his aunt and her family in Suffolk County.  \nMr. Hernandez works in landscaping and snow removal, and sends money to his mother and sisters \nto help support them. \n25.  On or about June 1, 2017, Suffolk County police approached Mr. Hernandez at a 7-\n11 and asked his name without any objective credible reason, founded suspicion, or legal basis to \ndo so. Frightened and taken aback by the arbitrary questioning, he stammered out a friend’s name \ninstead of his own.  The police officers searched Mr. Hernandez’s pockets.  They discovered a \nmoney transfer receipt (from sending money to his mother earlier that day), and saw that the name \n6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 7 of 23 PageID #:\n241\non the receipt was different from the name Mr. Hernandez had told them.  Mr. Hernandez admitted \nthat he had been scared and that the name on the receipt was his real name.  The officers arrested \nhim for false impersonation and took him to the precinct for the day.  He was taken to court the \nfollowing day and arraigned, released on his own recognizance, and given a date to return to court. \n26.  Mr. Hernandez inadvertently lost the paper with his court date and could not \nremember when he was to return.  Then, on July 2, 2017, Suffolk County police (who had a photo \nof Mr. Hernandez in their hands) questioned him at a gas station where he was sitting with a friend, \nand asked his name.  Mr. Hernandez was afraid that he was in trouble for missing his court date, \nand again gave a friend’s name.  The police arrested him again for false impersonation and took \nhim to the local precinct.  He was eventually arraigned before a Suffolk County judge, who set bail \nat $500 and remanded him to the custody of the SCSO. \n27.  On July 3, 2017, Mr. Hernandez was transferred to Yaphank, where he currently \nremains.  While in the custody of the SCSO, he was questioned by ICE agents stationed at the jail \nabout his immigration status, and given English forms to sign.  Mr. Hernandez refused to sign the \nforms, and was not provided with copies. \n28.  On August 18, 2017, Mr. Hernandez pled guilty to disorderly conduct, a violation, \nand was sentenced to time already served. However, instead of releasing Mr. Hernandez, SCSO \nretained him in custody pursuant to the detainer request issued by ICE.  Within 48 hours, absent \nrelief from this Court, SCSO will transfer custody of Mr. Hernandez to ICE. \n29.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a federal cabinet \nagency,  a Department of the Executive Branch of the United States Government, and is an agency \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  DHS houses the office of ICE and ICE’s division of \nEnforcement and Removal Operations, the entities which issue the I-247 immigration detainers to \n7 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 8 of 23 PageID #:\n242\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement.  DHS is ultimately responsible for how immigration \nregulations are applied and the approval of the use of the standard I-247 detainer form under which \npurported authority the Plaintiff was detained.  DHS and/or its employees, agents, or representatives \nare involved in the violations of constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n30.  Defendant Secretary of DHS (“Secretary”) is, among other responsibilities, charged \nwith the constitutional and lawful implementation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \n§§  1101,  et  seq.,  and  with  the  administration  of  the  division  of  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement.  He/she is sued in his/her official capacity. \n31.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke (“Duke”) is the Acting Secretary of the DHS.  Defendant \nDuke is, among other responsibilities, charged with the constitutional and lawful implementation \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq., and with the administration of \nthe division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n32.  Defendant ICE is a subdivision of DHS.  ICE is an agency within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(f).  ICE and/or its employees, agents, or representatives are involved in the violations \nof constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n33.  Defendant  Thomas  D.  Homan  (“Homan”)  is  the  Acting  Director  of  the  U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.

He is sued in his official capacity. \n34.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence (“Albence”) is the Executive Associate Director of \nthe  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement.    Defendant  Albence  is,  among  other \nresponsibilities, charged with the constitutional and lawful implementation of the Immigration and \n8 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 9 of 23 PageID #:\n243\nNationality  Act,  8  U.S.C.  §§  1101,  et  seq.,  and  with  the  administration  of  the  division  of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n35.  Defendant County of Suffolk (“County”) is a duly constituted municipal corporation \nof the State of New York.  Upon information and belief, the County has direct authority over \nDefendant SCSO.  The County and/or its employees, agents or representatives are involved in the \nviolations of constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n36.  Defendant Steven Bellone (“Bellone”) is the County Executive of the County of \nSuffolk.  Defendant Bellone is, among other responsibilities, charged with the administration of the \nCounty of Suffolk.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n37.  Defendant SCSO is an entity, agency, department, and/or subdivision of the County.  \nThe SCSO and/or its employees, agents or representatives are involved in the violations of \nconstitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n38.  Defendant Vincent F. DeMarco (“DeMarco”) is the Sheriff of Suffolk County and \npresides over the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office as its chief executive officer.  He has held this \nposition since November 8, 2005.  Upon information and belief, Defendant DeMarco has direct \nauthority over the SCSO.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n39.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a), DHS, through its division of ICE, purports to have \nthe authority to issue detainers in accordance with the intent and requirements of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (“INA”). \n40.  SCSO  has  stated  that  its  policy—unlike  that  of  many  other  law  enforcement \nagencies—is to comply with detainer requests by holding the individuals in question for up to 48 \nhours past the time when they would otherwise be released to allow ICE to decide whether to take \ncustody of a detainee and then take custody of those it chooses.  \n9 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 10 of 23 PageID #:\n244\n41.  For its part, and according to Defendant Homan, as of June 13, 2017 ICE has \nincreased the issuance of detainers 75 percent compared with the same time period in 2016.  \nRelatedly, a Washington Post article reports that ICE has deputized over 40 local law enforcement \nagencies to help ICE enforce immigration law, and that besides conducting its own searches, ICE \nuses a fingerprint-sharing program to learn when an undocumented immigrant has been arrested by \nstate or local authorities. \n42.  On the detainer that was issued against Plaintiffs, ICE officials justified continued \ndetention of Plaintiffs on the sole ground that “there is reason to believe that the subject is a \nremovable alien,” which is a civil, not a criminal, violation of the INA.  The detainer requests that \nSCSO:  \nMaintain custody of the alien for a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS \nbeyond the time when he/she would otherwise have been released from your \ncustody to allow DHS to assume custody. The alien must be served with a copy \nof this form for the detainer to take effect.  \n \n43.  Plaintiffs’ detainers were not issued pursuant to warrants of arrest in removal \nproceedings  or  a  deportation  orders.    Furthermore,  on  information  and  belief  ICE  had  no \nparticularized reasons to believe that the specific detainees at issue were likely to escape before \nwarrants could be obtained for their arrest—the only circumstance in which ICE may detain an alien \nwithout a warrant.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).  The completed detainers list no such particularized \nreasons. \n44.  Neither ICE nor SCSO provides an administrative procedure for challenging the \nissuance of a detainer.  Likewise, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has ruled that it does \nnot have jurisdiction to consider challenges to detainers because it has found that individuals held \non detainers are not in federal immigration custody.  \n45.  The detainers contain a paragraph entitled “notice to the detainee,” which reads as \n10 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 11 of 23 PageID #:\n245\nfollows: \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has placed an immigration detainer \non you. An immigration detainer is a notice to a law enforcement agency that DHS \nintends to assume custody of you (after you otherwise would be released from \ncustody) because there is probable cause that you are subject to removal from the \nUnited States under federal immigration law. DHS has requested that the law \nenforcement agency that is currently detaining you maintain custody of you for a \nperiod not to exceed 48 hours beyond the time when you would have been released \nbased on your criminal charges or convictions. If DHS does not take you into \ncustody  during  this  additional  48  hour  period,  you  should  contact  your \ncustodian (the agency that is holding you now) to inquire about your release. If \nyou believe you are a United States citizen or the victim of a crime, please \nadvise DHS by calling the ICE Law Enforcement Support Center toll free at \n(855) 448-6903. \n \n46.  Thus, even if Plaintiffs had timely received a copy of their detainers (which they did \nnot) this notice does not constitute adequate due process.  Among other things, the inclusion of a \nhotline number on a notice (written in a language Plaintiffs do not speak) for certain specific \nproblems, even if Plaintiffs had been able to call it, did not afford them an adequate opportunity to \nchallenge their detention.   \n47.  The detainer forms state that ICE “requests” that SCSO detain the individual for an \nadditional 48 hours so that ICE can assume direct, physical custody of the individual.  However, \nthe regulation cited on the detainer form mandates that any local law enforcement agency, like the \nSCSO, detain the individual on ICE’s behalf.  The regulation states:  “such [criminal justice] agency \nshall maintain custody of the alien for a period not to exceed 48 hours . . . in order to permit \nassumption of custody by [ICE].”  8 C.F.R. § 287.7(d) (emphasis added).  This regulation, as set \nforth below, violates the United States and New York Constitutions and exceeds the statutory \nauthority pursuant to which it is promulgated. \n48.  The SCSO is well aware that numerous state and federal courts have found law \nenforcement agencies liable for Fourth Amendment violations where they have held individuals \n11 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 12 of 23 PageID #:\n246\npursuant to detainers.  Indeed, in or about 2014, Suffolk County’s own attorney advised local \nauthorities against the honoring of detainers unless accompanied by a judicial warrant.  \n49.  In or about February 2017, the New York State Sheriffs’ Association (of which \nSCSO is a member) commissioned a comprehensive review of the relevant case law in light of the \nissuance by ICE of its new detainer form.  The Association’s report concluded that “[s]heriffs \nshould not detain persons beyond their normal release date based on a federal detainer warrant, even \nif accompanied by an order of deportation or removal, unless there is also a judicial warrant.” \n(emphasis added).  A true and correct copy of the Sheriffs’ Association Report and analysis is \nattached hereto as Exhibit D. \n50.  The SCSO, undeterred, has continued to comply with detainers, and, as in the case \nof Plaintiffs, to detain individuals even beyond the time requested under the detainer.  The SCSO \nappears similarly untroubled by the New York State Attorney General’s earlier conclusion (which \npost-dates the introduction of the new detainer forms) that “[a]bsent a judicial warrant, [local law \nenforcement agencies] should honor ICE or [Customs and Border Protection] detainer requests only \nin limited, specific circumstances,” meaning “a showing of probable cause that the individual \ncommitted a crime or that an exception to the probable cause requirement applies.” (emphasis \nadded) A true and correct copy of the New York State Attorney General’s report is attached hereto \nas Exhibit E. \n51.  In short, the SCSO knows, or has reason to know, that complying with detainers is \nunlawful.  Thus, its continued honoring of ICE detainers is a willful violation of Plaintiffs’ statutory \nand constitutional rights. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n52.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1), (b)(2) and/or (c)(4), Plaintiffs, seek to represent \na class (the “Class”) consisting of: \n12 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 13 of 23 PageID #:\n247\nAll persons who were, are, or will be detained by SCSO (a) on the basis of an ICE \ndetainer in which ICE requested SCSO to continue to detain the individual after \nSCSO’s detention authority has otherwise expired; and (b) where ICE has not (prior \nto service of such detainer) served a judicially authorized warrant of arrest for \nremoval proceedings. \n53.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5), Plaintiff Mr. Hernandez seeks to represent a \nsub-class (the “Sub-Class”) consisting of: \nAll persons who are or will be detained by SCSO (a) and against whom ICE has an \nactive immigration detainer in which ICE requested SCSO to continue to detain the \nindividual after SCSO’s detention authority has otherwise expired; and (b) where \nICE has not (prior to service of such detainer) served judicially authorized warrant \nof arrest for removal proceedings. \n54.  The  Class  seeks  declaratory  relief—and  the  Sub-Class  seeks  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief—that prohibits the detention of any individual by local law enforcement agencies \non the basis of an ICE detainer and otherwise eliminates or remedies Defendants-Respondents’ \napplication of immigration detainer regulations, policies, practices, acts, and omissions that are \ndepriving Plaintiffs of their liberty in violation of their rights.  The Class also seeks monetary \ndamages to compensate Plaintiffs for this unlawful detention.   \n55.  The proposed Class and Sub-Class are very numerous.  In FY2009, at least 223,297 \nindividuals detained by ICE (approximately 60% of ICE’s FY2009 detention population) were first \nstopped, arrested, or criminally convicted by local law enforcement agencies.  See Dora Schriro, \nICE, Immigration Detention Overview and Recommendations at 11-12 (Oct. 6, 2009).  According \nto  testimony  given  by  Defendant  Homan  before  the  House  Committee  on  Appropriations, \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, ICE has issued 78,176 detainers in the current fiscal year—\na figure up 75 percent compared with the same time period in 2016. \n56.  Joinder  of  all  Class  and  Sub-Class  members  is  impracticable.    Because  ICE \ncontinuously lodges detainers against individuals and assumes physical custody of those held on \ndetainers, the membership of the Class and Sub-Class changes constantly. \n13 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 14 of 23 PageID #:\n248\nAll individuals who would fall within the Class and Sub-Class Definitions have had ICE detainer \nregulations,  policies,  practices,  acts,  and  omissions  applied  against  them,  causing  unlawful \ndeprivation of liberty in violation of their rights.  There are questions of law or fact common to all \nClass and Sub-Class members, including, but not limited to: \n  Whether ICE has exceeded its statutory authority (APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) in \nplacing detainers on Class and Sub-Class members, including whether promulgation \nof 8 C.F.R. § 236.1(a) and 8 C.F.R. § 287.7 exceed the limits of the Constitution \nand/or ICE’s statutory authority; \n  Whether ICE’s issuance of a detainer instructing further detention based solely on a \ndetermination that there is reason to believe the Class or Sub-Class member is an \nalien subject to removal violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution; \n  Whether ICE’s issuance of a detainer without a prior or concurrent service of a \nNotice to Appear or other charging document, an administrative arrest warrant, an \norder of deportation, or a particularized determination that the alien in question is \nlikely to flee before a warrant can be obtained as per 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) violates \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution; \n  Whether ICE’s issuance of an immigration detainer without providing Class and \nSub-Class members an adequate means of challenging detainers violates the Fifth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution; \n  Whether SCSO’s detention of a Class or Sub-Class member based only on a detainer \nas described above violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United \nStates Constitution and/or the First Article of the New York Constitution; \n  Whether SCSO’s detention of a Class or Sub-Class member pursuant to a detainer \nwithout providing or requiring notice to the Class or Sub-Class member violates the \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and/or the First Article of \nthe New York Constitution; and \n  Whether SCSO’s detention of a Class or Sub-Class member pursuant to a detainer \nwithout providing the Class or Sub-Class member an adequate means of challenging \ndetainers violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution \nand/or the First Article of the New York Constitution. \n57.  Given the commonality of the questions shared by all Class and Sub-Class members, \nprosecuting  separate  claims  as  to  individual  Class  and  Sub-Class  members  would  establish \nincompatible standards of conduct for Defendants and the adjudications as to individual Class and \nSub-Class members’ claims might be dispositive of the interests of other Class and Sub-Class \n14 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 15 of 23 PageID #:\n249\nmembers, thus substantially impairing their ability to protect their interests. \n58.  Defendants have acted and intend to act in a manner adverse to the rights of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class, making final declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the Class \nas a whole, and making final declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the Sub-\nClass. \n59.  Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in class action, civil rights, and immigrants’ \nrights litigation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the Class \nand Sub-Class. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolations of the First Article of the New York Constitution  \n(Against SCSO, County, Bellone, and DeMarco) \n60.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 59 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n61.  By virtue of the acts described above, SCSO and County deprived Plaintiffs and \nother members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class of liberty without due process of law in \ncontravention of the First Article of the New York Constitution. \n62.  The acts and conduct of the servants, representatives, agents, and employees of \nSCSO and County were the direct and proximate cause of injury and damage to Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class and violated their statutory and common law rights \nas guaranteed by the laws and Constitution of the State of New York. \n63.  SCSO and County are liable for the above-mentioned actions of their agents, \nrepresentatives, servants, and/or employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior. \n64.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and \nSub-Class were severely and seriously injured, both bodily and mentally, suffered a loss of \n15 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 16 of 23 PageID #:\n250\nenjoyment  of  life,  loss  of  liberty,  experienced  pain  and  suffering,  emotional  distress,  great \nhumiliation, costs and expenses, economic loss and other damages, and were otherwise damaged \nand injured. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution  \n(Against SCSO, County, Bellone, and DeMarco) \n65.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 64 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n66.  Due process principles forbid the infringement of fundamental liberty interests, \nunless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. \n67.  The  continued  unauthorized  detention  of  an  individual  in  the  absence  of  any \nstandards guiding the issuance of the detainer is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernment interest.  As they were detained by SCSO (under the supervision of County) past the \npoint of their judicially authorized release, the fundamental liberty interests of Plaintiffs and other \nmembers  of  the  proposed  Class  and  Sub-Class  guaranteed  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s \nsubstantive due process protections were violated. \n68.  Due process further requires that the government be constrained before it acts in a \nway that deprives individuals of “liberty” interests protected under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n69.  Detainers issued by ICE purport to require state and local law enforcement officials \nto hold individuals in custody, without any basis in state law, standards guiding their issuance, or \nany judicial review, solely as a means of enforcing federal civil immigration statutes, for up to 48 \nhours, excluding weekends and government holidays.  See 8 C.F.R. § 287.7. \n16 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 17 of 23 PageID #:\n251\n70.  The Due Process Clause protects against the deprivation of liberty interests without \nthe due process of law and requires notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation \nas well as a method by which to challenge the deprivation.  Plaintiffs and other members of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class were provided with none of these, in violation of their due process \nrights. \n71.  The private liberty interests of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class \nand Sub-Class are overwhelming.  The risk that they have been deprived of their liberty erroneously \nis high due to the fact that no court of law has adjudicated the lawfulness of SCSO’s continued \ndetention (under the supervision of County) of individuals past their scheduled release date. \n72.  Interpreting  immigration  detainers  as  authorizing  Defendants’  continued \nunauthorized detention of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class \nwithout judicial review violates the procedural due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment and Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class have been \ndamaged as a result. \n73.  The relief sought by Mr. Hernandez and other members of the proposed Sub-Class \nis necessary to prevent continued and future injury. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n(Against All Defendants) \n74.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 73 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n75.  28 U.S.C. § 2241 empowers this Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus, ordering the \nproduction of any person held “in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United \nStates.”  In addition, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 grants Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class \n17 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 18 of 23 PageID #:\n252\nand Sub-Class a cause of action to challenge Defendants’ deprivation of their “rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws” under color of state and local law. \n76.  Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class are held, or have \nbeen held, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.  Plaintiffs, and other members of \nthe proposed Class and Sub-Class were and are held solely on the basis of the ICE detainers issued \nin their names.  SCSO (under the supervision of County) had no legal authority to continue to hold \nPlaintiffs, and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class in custody after their judicially \nauthorized release.  Moreover, SCSO (under the supervision of County) has no legal authority to \ncontinue to hold Mr. Hernandez and other members of the proposed Sub-Class in custody. \n77.  Immigration detainers lack any standards guiding their issuance.  The detainers \nissued to SCSO (under the supervision of County) regarding Plaintiffs and other members of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class were not issued by ICE (under the supervision of DHS) according to \nany legal standard.  They were not issued based on evidence demonstrating reasonable suspicion, \nprobable cause, or any other ground.  Defendants’ continued detention of Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class thus deprived them of their liberty without probable \ncause. \n78.  Mr. Hernandez and other members of the proposed Sub-Class are therefore held in \nthe custody of SCSO, but without any basis in law and without any probable cause. \n79.  SCSO’s continued detention of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class \nand Sub-Class (under the supervision of County) violated and continue to violate their Fourth \nAmendment constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure and Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class have been damaged as a result. \n18 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 19 of 23 PageID #:\n253\nFourth Amendment Violation: Detention Without a Hearing  \n(Against All Defendants) \n80.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 79 above are repeated and alleged \nas through fully set forth herein. \n81.  Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class have been held in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. \n82.  Immigration detainers issued by ICE (under the supervision of DHS) purport to \nrequire state and local law enforcement officials to hold individuals in custody, without any basis \nin state law and solely as a means of enforcing federal civil immigration statutes, for up to 48 hours.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 287.7. \n83.  Upon the judicially authorized release of Plaintiffs and other members of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class, Defendants’ legal authority to maintain custody of Plaintiffs and \nother members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class ended or will end.  Defendants’ continued \ndetention of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class constitutes the \nequivalent of a new arrest. \n84.  Because of this, and the fact that immigration detainers are not warrants issued upon \nprobable cause, these detainer procedures violate the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that an \nindividual arrested without a warrant be brought before a neutral magistrate for a probable cause \nhearing within 48 hours of arrest, irrespective of weekends or holidays. \n85.  Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class were not brought \nbefore a neutral magistrate for a probable cause hearing.  Upon information and belief, Defendants \nhave no process for bringing individuals subject to detainers before a neutral magistrate for a \nprobable cause hearing within 48 hours.  Defendants’ detention of Plaintiffs and other members of \n19 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 20 of 23 PageID #:\n254\nthe proposed Class and Sub-Class therefore violated their Constitutional right to be free from \nunreasonable seizures and they have been damaged as a result. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D)  \n(Against ICE, DHS, Secretary, Duke, Homan, Albence) \n86.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 85 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n87.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D) requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law;  contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or \nimmunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \n[or] without observance of procedure required by law.” \n88.  ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to restrict its issuance of detainers to \nits authority under the INA caused Plaintiffs significant prejudice by depriving them of their liberty. \n89.  ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to issue detainers in accordance with \ndue process protections required by the relevant provisions of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(a)(2) and 8 U.S.C. § 1357(d)) caused Plaintiffs significant pain and suffering by depriving \nthem of their liberty.  In particular, ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to obtain judicial \nwarrants prior to detaining Plaintiffs, and failure to demonstrate any particularized reason to believe \nthat Plaintiffs were likely to flee before such a warrant could be obtained, violates 8 U.S.C. § \n1357(a)(2). \n90.  ICE’s application (under the supervision of DHS) of the immigration detainer \nregulations and issuance of detainers against Plaintiffs exceeded ICE’s statutory authority in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n20 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 21 of 23 PageID #:\n255\n91.  As an actual and proximate result of ICE’s statutory violations, under the supervision \nof DHS, Plaintiffs have suffered a significant deprivation of their liberty without due process of law \nand have been damaged as a result.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at law \nto address the wrongs described herein.  The injunctive and declaratory relief sought by Plaintiffs \nis necessary to prevent continued and future injury. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution  \n(Against ICE, DHS, Secretary, Duke, Homan, Albence) \n92.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 91 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n93.  ICE’s issuance of detainers (under the supervision of DHS) based solely on a \ndetermination that there is reason to believe an individual is an alien subject to removal caused \nPlaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class significant pain and suffering by \ndepriving them of their liberty without due process of law. \n94.  ICE’s issuance of detainers (under the supervision of DHS) without requiring that \nsubjects of a detainer receive effective notice of the detainer caused Plaintiffs and other members \nof the proposed Class and Sub-Class to suffer substantial prejudice without affording them an \nopportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation. \n95.  ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to provide a proper mechanism by \nwhich subjects of a detainer may challenge the issuance of a detainer against them caused Plaintiffs \nand other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class substantial prejudice by depriving them of \ntheir liberty without due process of law. \n96.  ICE’s  detainer  regulations,  policies,  practices,  acts,  and  omissions  (under  the \nsupervision of DHS) caused significant deprivation of liberty of Plaintiffs and other members of the \n21 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 22 of 23 PageID #:\n256\nproposed Class and Sub-Class without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n97.  As  a  proximate  result  of  ICE’s  unconstitutional  detainer  regulations,  policies, \npractices, acts, and omissions, under the supervision of DHS, Plaintiffs and other members of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class have suffered, and continue to suffer, a significant deprivation of \ntheir liberty without due process of law and they has been damaged as a result.  Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class have no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at law \nto address the wrongs described herein.  The injunctive and declaratory relief sought by Plaintiffs \nand other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class is necessary to prevent continued and \nfuture injury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class pray \nthat this Court grant the following relief: \n(1)  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus requiring Defendants to release Mr. Hernandez and \nother members of the proposed Sub-Class forthwith; \n(2)  Issue an injunction ordering Defendants not to detain any individual solely on the \nbasis of an immigration detainer; \n(3)  Enter  a  judgment  declaring  that  Defendants’  detention  of  Plaintiffs  and  other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class was unauthorized by statute and contrary to law; \n(4)  Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n(5)  Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest at the maximum legal rate; \n(6)  Award reasonable costs and attorney’s fees; and \n(7)  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n \n22 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 12     Filed 08/18/17     Page 23 of 23 PageID #:\n257\nDated:   New York, New York \nAugust 18, 2017        WINSTON & STRAWN LLP \n              Counsel for Plaintiffs \nBy:    /s/ Aldo A.

Without such cooperation, removable aliens, including \nindividuals who have committed crimes, would be released into local communities, where it is harder \nand more dangerous for ICE to take custody of them.  \nICE’s use of—and the SCSO’s cooperation with—detainers and federal arrest warrants is \nconsistent with federal and New York law. Federal statutes authorize ICE to use detainers and \nwarrants, and allow States and localities to cooperate with them. Such cooperation is consistent with \nboth the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, §  12 of the New York \nConstitution. The Court should grant SCSO’s motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.  \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n  The federal government has “broad, undoubted power of the subject of immigration and the \n                                                 \n1 Under 28 U.S.C. § 517, “[t]he Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, may be sent by \nthe Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States \nin a suit pending in a court of the United States . . . .” See also 28 U.S.C. § 518(b) (authorizing Attorney General \nto send Department attorneys to argue such cases). These statutes provide a mechanism for the United States \nto submit its views in cases in which the United States is not a party. See, e.g., Application of Blondin v. Dubois, 78 \nF. Supp. 2d 283, 288 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); see also Freund v. Republic of France, 592 F. Supp. 2d 540, 568 (S.D.N.Y. \n2008) (Sullivan, J.), aff’d sub nom. Freund v. Societe Nationale des Chemins de fer Francais, 391 F. App’x 939 (2d Cir. \n2010) (affording deference to the United States’ statement of interest “because of both its source and the \npersuasiveness of its reasoning.”). \n2 Another component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n(CBP), also issues detainers. As the detainers here were issued by ICE, this brief analyzes ICE detainer practices \nonly. \n  1 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 12 of 34 PageID #:\n1280\nstatus of aliens.” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012). This includes authority to interview, \narrest, and detain removable aliens. See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) (Secretary of Homeland Security may issue \nadministrative  arrest  warrants  and  may  arrest  and  detain  aliens  pending  removal  decision);  id. \n§ 1226(c)(1) (Secretary “shall take into custody” aliens who have committed certain crimes when \n“released”); id. § 1231(a)(1)(A), (2) (Secretary may detain and remove aliens ordered removed); id. \n§ 1357(a)(1), (2) (authorizing certain warrantless interrogations and arrests).3  \n  In enforcing the immigration laws, the federal government works closely with state and local \ngovernments.  “Consultation  between  federal  and  state  officials  is  an  important  feature  of  the \nimmigration system.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 411. Congress therefore has directed that a federal, state, \nor local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity \nor official from sending to, or receiving from, DHS “information regarding the citizenship or \nimmigration status ... of any individual.”  8 U.S.C. § 1373(a); see id. § 1644 (same); see also id. \n§ 1357(g)(10)(A)  (providing  for  state  and  local  “communicat[ion]  with  [DHS]  regarding  the \nimmigration status of any individual, including reporting knowledge that a particular alien is not \nlawfully present in the United States”). Congress also expressly authorized states and localities “to \ncooperate with the [Secretary] in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not \nlawfully present in the United States.”  Id. § 1357(g)(10)(B). \n  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., contemplates these \ncooperative efforts, which are critical to enabling the federal government to identify and remove the \nhundreds of thousands of aliens who violate immigration laws each year. There are three categories \nof cooperation. \nFirst, the INA specifically authorizes DHS to enter into cooperative agreements with States \nand localities, see 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g), also known as 287(g) agreements, under which state and local \nofficers may, “subject to the direction and supervision of the [Secretary],” id. § 1357(g)(3), perform \nthe “functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention \nof aliens.” Id. § 1357(g)(1). SCSO currently has no such agreement with ICE.  \n                                                 \n3 Following the Homeland Security Act of 2002, many references in the INA to the “Attorney General” are \nnow read to mean the Secretary of Homeland Security. See 6 U.S.C. § 557; Clark v. Suarez Martinez, 543 U.S. \n371, 374 n.1 (2005). \n  2 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 13 of 34 PageID #:\n1281\nSecond,  Congress  has  authorized  DHS  to  enter  into  agreements,  referred  to  as \nintergovernmental services agreements (IGSAs), with localities for the “housing, care, and security of \npersons detained by [DHS] pursuant to Federal law.” Id. § 1103(a)(11)(A). In such circumstances, ICE \nhas arrested a detainee and the alien is in ICE’s custody, but ICE uses the IGSA to house the alien \ntemporarily in a state or local facility. See, e.g., Roman v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 314, 320–21 (6th Cir. 2003). \nSuch agreements, unlike 287(g) agreements, have no formal training requirements. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1103(a)(11)(A); accord id. § 1231(g)(1). Until an immigration officer arrests the detainee, a detainee \ncannot be held under an IGSA.4   \nIf, however, ICE has previously arrested an alien through service of an administrative warrant, \nand should that alien later come into state or local custody following the commission of a new criminal \noffense, the state or locality may administratively transfer the alien to federal custody upon completion \nof the alien’s state charges should ICE request that it do so in limited circumstances. Where ICE has \npreviously released an alien on bond, and that alien has reoffended, ICE may reinstate the prior \nadministrative warrant after revoking bond. See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(b) (“The [Secretary] at any time may \nrevoke a bond or parole authorized under subsection (a), rearrest the alien under the original warrant, \nand detain the alien.”). In such circumstances, ICE has already served the warrant and effected an \narrest, so the alien could be returned to ICE custody without issuance of a new arrest warrant. In \naddition, if ICE has issued a new arrest warrant based on the new state criminal charges, and serves \nthat warrant on the alien while still in state custody, the locality may, following a request from ICE to \ndo so, administratively transfer the alien to federal custody when eligible for release from state custody. \nIn either scenario, such transfers are permissible cooperative “apprehension[s]” or “detention[s]” \nmade at ICE’s request, so long as they are preceded by a request from ICE to a locality that has an \nIGSA with the federal government that authorizes the locality to house aliens on behalf of ICE in \nexchange for payment from ICE for those services. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10). As discussed below, \nSCSO had an IGSA with ICE. \nThird, even without a formal 287(g) agreement or IGSA detention contract, States and \n                                                 \n4 An IGSA does not deputize state law enforcement to unilaterally perform the functions of a federal \nimmigration officer. Rather, it governs the housing, at federal government request and cost, of federal detainees \nin state facilities. Therefore, an IGSA is distinct from a 287(g) agreement. Compare 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(11)(A) \n(authority for IGSAs), with id. § 1357(g)(1)-(9) (authority for 287(g) agreements). \n  3 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 14 of 34 PageID #:\n1282\nlocalities such as SCSO may “communicate with the [Secretary] regarding the immigration status of \nany individual” or “cooperate with the [Secretary] in the identification, apprehension, detention, or \nremoval of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,” 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10), when that \ncooperation is following a “request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government,” \nArizona, 567 U.S. at 410. Such cooperation may include: “participat[ing] in a joint task force with \nfederal  officers”;  “provid[ing]  operational  support  in  executing  a  warrant”;  “allow[ing]  federal \nimmigration officials to gain access to detainees held in state facilities”; “arrest[ing] an alien for being \nremovable” when the federal government requests such cooperation; and “responding to requests for \ninformation about when an alien will be released from their custody.” Id. The INA permits such \ncooperation whether it is directed by state statute or is implemented ad hoc by a local sheriff. See id. at \n413. To comply with the Supremacy Clause, which invalidates undesired intrusions on the federal \ngovernment’s expansive immigration authority, a state or local government may not cooperate beyond \nthe terms of the federal government’s “request, approval, or other instruction.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at \n403. Thus, compliance with ICE policy, as expressed in the detainer request, is essential to the \nlawfulness of the local action. \nStates and localities frequently cooperate with federal immigration enforcement by responding \nto federal requests for assistance, often contained in federal immigration detainers, including those \nissued by ICE, a component of DHS responsible for immigration enforcement in the interior of the \ncountry. An immigration detainer notifies a State or locality that ICE intends to take custody of a \nremovable alien who is detained in state or local criminal custody, and asks the State or locality to \ncooperate with ICE in that effort. A detainer asks a State or locality to cooperate in two main respects: \n(1) by providing ICE with advance notification of the alien’s release from criminal custody; and (2) by \nmaintaining custody of the alien for up to 48 hours, based on ICE’s determination that it has probable \ncause to believe that the alien is removable, until DHS can take custody. See 8 C.F.R. § 287.7(a) \n(describing  notification  of  release),  (d)  (describing  request  for  continued  detention).  Statutes \nauthorizing such action include 8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(3), 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), and 1357(d). \nDHS’s detainer form, Form I-247A, sets forth the basis for DHS’s determination that it has \nprobable cause to believe that the subject is a removable alien. The form states that DHS’s probable \ncause is based on: (1) a final order of removal against the alien; (2) the pendency of removal \n  4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 15 of 34 PageID #:\n1283\nproceedings against the alien; (3) biometric confirmation of the alien’s identity and a records match in \nfederal databases that indicate, by themselves or with other reliable information, that the alien either \nlacks lawful immigration status or, despite such status, is removable; or (4) the alien’s voluntary \nstatements to an immigration officer, or other reliable evidence that the alien either lacks lawful \nimmigration  status  or,  despite  such  status,  is  removable.  Form  I-247A  at  1, \nhttps://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2017/I-247A.pdf. \nSpecifically, the current detainer form requests that the State or locality “[m]aintain custody of \nthe alien for a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS beyond the time when he/she would \notherwise have been released from your custody.” Id. (emphasis in original). The form makes clear \nthat, “[t]his detainer arises from DHS authorities and should not impact decisions about the alien’s \nbail, rehabilitation, parole, release, diversion, custody classification, work, quarter assignments, or \nother matters.” Id. The form also says that the “alien must be served with a copy of this form for the \ndetainer to take effect.” Id. The form encourages local law enforcement and the alien to contact ICE \nwith “any questions or concerns” about a detainer. Id. \nAs  of  April  2,  2017,  ICE  policy  requires  that  detainers  be  accompanied  by  a  signed \nadministrative warrant issued under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226 or 1231(a). See ICE Policy No. 10074.2 ¶¶ 2.4, \n2.5,  https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2017/10074-2.pdf.  That \nwarrant—either a Form I-200, Warrant for Arrest of Alien (issued for aliens not yet subject to a \nremoval order under 8 U.S.C. § 1226) or a Form I-205, Warrant of Removal/Deportation (issued for \naliens subject to a final removal order under 8 U.S.C. § 1231)—is issued by an executive immigration \nofficer and sets forth the basis for that officer’s probable-cause determination. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1, \n241.2, 287.5. It is this detainer and warrant which authorize a county to detain inmates who are \notherwise scheduled for release. See New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, --- F.3d ----, 2020 WL 911417, *7 \nn.10 (2d Cir. Feb. 26, 2020) (“Supported by an administrative warrant issued on a showing of probable \ncause, the detainer generally requests the agency then having custody of the alien to . . . detain the \nalien for a brief time to allow federal authorities to assume custody.”). \nIn sum, a state or local law enforcement agency may generally physically detain an alien \nsuspected of being removable in three scenarios: (1) the jurisdiction has a 287(g) agreement with ICE, \nunder which “state and local officials become de facto immigration officers, competent to act on their \n  5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 16 of 34 PageID #:\n1284\nown initiative,” City of El Cenizo, Texas v. Texas, 890 F.3d 164, 180 (5th Cir. 2018); (2) the jurisdiction \nhas an IGSA with ICE, which authorizes local law enforcement to house aliens at ICE’s request, after \nICE initially takes custody of those aliens and then decides to book those aliens into the local facility \nas ICE detainees, see Roman, 340 F.3d at 320–21; or (3) ICE requests cooperation from the law \nenforcement  agency  through  a  detainer,  accompanied  by  an  administrative  warrant,  thereby \nauthorizing the locality to maintain custody of the alien for up to 48 hours, and “under color of Federal \nauthority” for purposes of liability or immunity from suit. 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(8), (10)(B). Outside of \nthose scenarios or absent a “predicate federal request” to detain, see El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 189, a local \ngovernment’s seizure based on suspected removability is unilateral and thus in many cases unlawful \nas state action preempted by federal law. Arizona, 567 U.S. at 410. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nI.  SCSO’s cooperation with ICE \n  The SCSO had an IGSA with the United States Marshals Service from 1994 to November 14, \n2018. See Declaration of ICE Assistant Field Office Director Jacob Antoninis (Antoninis Decl.) ¶¶ 5, \n14. The IGSA was modified in October 2017 to allow ICE to house immigration detainees in ICE \ncustody at SCSO facilities located in Riverhead, New York. See Antoninis Decl. ¶ 5. Under ICE policy, \nif ICE wants to be notified of the impending release of an alien in state criminal custody for whom \nICE has probable cause to believe he or she is removable from the United States, it will lodge a \ndetainer and administrative warrant with the alien’s state or local custodian. See ICE Policy No. 10074.2 \n¶¶ 2.3–2.7. Once grounds for state custody lapse—that is, once the state charge does not authorize \nfurther detention—if ICE wants to take physical custody of the alien, ICE will do so within 48 hours. \nId. ¶ 2.7. Alternatively, if ICE wanted to use bed space at Riverhead under the IGSA, ICE would arrest \nthe alien upon his release Riverhead, or from SCSO’s detention facility located in Yaphank, New York, \nthrough the personal service of an administrative warrant, after which ICE would book the alien back \ninto SCSO physical custody at Riverhead subject to the IGSA as an ICE detainee. See Antoninis Decl. \n¶¶ 9–13.  \n  On November 14, 2018, the New York State Appellate Division, Second Department, issued \na decision in People ex rel. Wells v. DeMarco, 168 A.D.3d 31, 88 N.Y.S.3d 518 (N.Y. App. Div. 2018). \nPursuant to this decision, SCSO no longer holds any alien in their custody pursuant to an ICE detainer. \n  6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 17 of 34 PageID #:\n1285\nSCSO also no longer operates under an IGSA with ICE. Antoninis Decl. ¶ 14. \n   \nII.  Plaintiffs’ claims5 \nA.    Plaintiff Joaquin Orellana Castaneda \nAccording to court paperwork, at about 4:15 a.m. on April 23, 2017, the Suffolk County Police \nDepartment (SCPD) observed Castaneda driving through a steady red light, driving on the sidewalk, \nand otherwise failing to stay in his lane. See Antoninis Decl. ¶ 7. Standardized field sobriety tests \nindicated Castaneda was intoxicated and SCPD arrested Castaneda for driving while intoxicated \n(DWI). Id. Castaneda was then placed in SCSO custody. Based on Castaneda’s voluntary statements \nand other reliable evidence, ICE had probable cause to believe that he lacked lawful immigration status \nand was subject to removal for being present in the United States without having been inspected and \nadmitted or paroled. Id.; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). At around 12:15 p.m. the next day, ICE \nprovided SCSO with a detainer, signed by an ICE deportation officer. See Ex. D. At the same time, \nICE provided SCSO with an administrative warrant for Castaneda’s arrest, signed by an ICE \nsupervisory officer. See Antoninis Decl. ¶ 7. ICE also issued Castaneda a Notice to Appear (NTA).6 \nId. At 4:12 p.m. that day, Castaneda posted bond with SCSO, but was not released. Id. SCSO notified \nICE that, at this time, Castaneda remained in detention “only” due to ICE’s detainer and arrest \nwarrant, and requested that ICE make arrangements for a “pick-up no later than 48 hours of this \nnotification.” Id. Less than 48 hours later, at 5:03 a.m. on April 26, Castaneda was released to ICE. Id. \nThat day, Castaneda received the NTA and a notice stating the basis for ICE’s custody determination. \nId. On August 25, 2017 an immigration judge (IJ) denied Castaneda’s request for release on bond, \nfinding that Castaneda posed a danger to society because of DWI charges. Id. Castaneda moved to \nterminate his proceedings, or, alternatively, to suppress evidence obtained by ICE based on the \ndetainer, alleging that ICE’s actions violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights and exceeded \nICE’s statutory authority under the INA. See id. On October 17, 2017, an IJ denied the motions and \n                                                 \n5 Exhibits specific to each individual plaintiff, including pertinent arrest reports and ICE warrants, were \npreviously filed with the Court with the United States’ motion to dismiss. See ECF 24, Exhibits A through V \n(ECF 24:3 through 24:24).  \n6 An NTA provides the alien with written notice of the charges of inadmissibility or deportability; legal authority \nof immigration proceedings, notice, counsel and failure to appear requirements. 8 U.S.C. § 1229. \n  7 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 18 of 34 PageID #:\n1286\nfound  him  removable  as  charged.  Id.  Castaneda  subsequently  was  removed  to  Guatemala  on \nDecember 13, 2017. Id.. \nB.    Plaintiff German Hernandez Argueta \nOn July 2, 2017, SCPD arrested German Hernandez Argueta, also known as “Jose Amilcar \nRomero,” for false personation and for “creat[ing] a hazardous or physically offensive condition by \nsome act which served no legitimate purpose.” Antoninis Decl. ¶ 8. Hernandez was detained in \nSCSO’s custody. Id. While in custody, ICE officers interviewed Hernandez. Id. Based on Hernandez’s \nvoluntary statements and other reliable evidence, ICE had probable cause to believe that Hernandez \nlacked lawful U.S. immigration status and was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Id. \nOn July 7, 2017, ICE issued Hernandez a NTA. Id. That same day, ICE provided SCSO with a \ndetainer, signed by a deportation officer, and an administrative warrant for Hernandez’s arrest, signed \nby a supervisory deportation officer. Id. On August 18, 2017, Hernandez pleaded guilty to disorderly \nconduct in Suffolk County criminal court and was sentenced to time served. Id. That day Hernandez \nwas transferred from SCSO custody to ICE custody, pending the outcome of his removal proceedings. \nId. During his removal proceedings, an IJ granted Hernandez release from ICE custody on bond of \n$6,000. Id.  \nHernandez was arrested again by SCPD on March 9, 2018, for criminal possession of a weapon \nand false personation. Id. On March 10, 2018, ICE lodged a detainer and a second administrative \nwarrant with SCPD for Hernandez’s arrest. Id. An ICE officer then served the detainer and arrest \nwarrant on Hernandez in person on March 12, 2018. Id. On March 30, 2018, Hernandez became \neligible for release from SCPD custody. Id. ICE requested that SCSO detain Hernandez pursuant to \nthe IGSA and the outstanding administrative warrant that ICE had previously served on Hernandez. \nId. SCSO then administratively transferred Hernandez into ICE custody consistent with the IGSA \nand the ICE request. Id. ICE paid SCSO to house Hernandez during this time. Id. On April 2, 2018, \nICE transferred Hernandez to another ICE detention facility. Id. On May 8, 2018, ICE cancelled \nHernandez’s previously posted $6,000 bond. Id. On June 22, 2018, an IJ granted Hernandez another \nbond in the amount of $5,000, and ICE released Hernandez on August 3, 2018 when he posted that \nbond. Id. Hernandez appeared before an IJ on September 17, 2018, and his merits hearing is now \nscheduled for August 3, 2020. Id.  \n  8 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 19 of 34 PageID #:\n1287\nIII.  The present action \nCastaneda filed suit on July 18, 2017, against Suffolk County and the federal government \n(DHS, ICE, and several ICE officials in their official capacity). See ECF 1. On August 18, Castaneda \nfiled an amended complaint that added Hernandez as a plaintiff and added a claim for a writ of habeas \ncorpus. See ECF 12. On November 9, 2017, the federal  government and the Suffolk County \ndefendants each moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). \nSee ECF 23, 24. On January 2, 2018, the Court so ordered dismissal upon the Plaintiffs and the federal \ngovernment’s stipulation, whereby this action was dismissed against the federal government without \nprejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). ECF 30. On May 29, Plaintiffs filed a second amended \ncomplaint solely against defendants County of Suffolk, Steven Bellone, SCSO, Errol Toulon, Jr., and \n“other  individuals  in  charge  to  be  identified”  (collectively  “Suffolk  Defendants”);  no  federal \ngovernment officials are named as defendants. See 2AC. The second amended complaint also presents \na putative class and sub-class. See id. On August 9, 2018, Suffolk Defendants filed a motion to dismiss \nthe second amended complaint. ECF 40. Plaintiffs and the Suffolk Defendants then attempted to \nnegotiate a settlement, but to no avail. ECF 71. On December 13, 2019, Plaintiffs sought permission \nto file a motion for summary judgment on liability. ECF 72. That motion was denied. See Order, dated \nJan. 14, 2020. Suffolk Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss on February 11, 2020. Plaintiffs’ \nopposition is due to be served by March 10, 2020.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \nThis action should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P 12(b)(1) because Plaintiffs lack Article \nIII standing to raise claims for prospective equitable relief—both injunctive and declaratory relief—\non behalf of themselves or anyone else. To invoke federal subject matter jurisdiction, a party must \nestablish the existence of a “justiciable controversy” with the adverse party—one that is “definite and \nconcrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. \nHaworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240–41 (1937). In other words, a plaintiff must demonstrate “‘a personal stake \nin the outcome of the controversy’ as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to \njustify the exercise of the court’s remedial powers on his behalf.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498–\n99 (1975) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)). For this reason, plaintiffs bringing suit in \n  9 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 20 of 34 PageID #:\n1288\nfederal courts must demonstrate that they have standing to seek the relief sought in the complaint. See \nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984).  \nEven if a party has standing to obtain damages to redress past injury, an individual asserting \nconstitutional  violations must  demonstrate  that  he  is  “likely  to  suffer  future  injury  from”  the \nchallenged conduct in order to justify prospective equitable relief. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. \n95, 105 (1983); Faulcon v. Jordan, 911 F. Supp. 52, 54 (N.D.N.Y. 1995) (“Although the plaintiff’s past \nrecord suggests a certain recidivism, that alone, particularly given that there are no threats of arrest \nagainst the plaintiff will not confer standing.”). That showing requires demonstrating a “likelihood of \nsubstantial and immediate irreparable injury,” O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1974), i.e., a \ndemonstration that the plaintiff faces “a real and immediate threat that he again” will suffer the same \nalleged harm. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105.  \nPlaintiffs fail to allege any likelihood that they will again be subject to an ICE detainer acted \nupon by Suffolk County. Indeed, following the New York Appellate Division’s November 2018 \ndecision People ex rel. Wells v. DeMarco, 168 A.D.3d 31, 88 N.Y.S.3d 518 (N.Y. App. Div. 2018), SCSO \nno longer holds any alien in their custody pursuant to an ICE detainer. Antoninis Decl. ¶ 14. SCSO \nalso no longer operates under an IGSA with ICE. Id.; see Lamar Advertising of Penn., LLC v. Town of \nOrchard Park, 356 F.3d 365, 377 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that, when a government entity repeals a \nchallenged provision, courts find the plaintiff’s claims moot “absent evidence that the defendant intends \nto reinstate the challenged [provision] after the litigation is dismissed”) (emphasis added). \nAnd such a showing in any event would require showing they are likely to be arrested yet again \nfor new criminal conduct, which cannot support standing because Plaintiffs “themselves are able—and \nindeed required by law—to prevent such a possibility from occurring.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 15 \n(2003). They accordingly cannot “show[] that the police [are] likely to do this to [them] again.” Lyons, \n461 U.S. at 107. Plaintiffs thus have no personal stake in the outcome of the controversy, and their \nclaims must be dismissed as unripe. See Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-08 \n(2003)  (ripeness  doctrine  is  designed  “to  prevent  the  courts,  through  avoidance  of  premature \nadjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and \nalso to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been \nformalized and its effects felt in a concrete way [].”). \n  10 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 21 of 34 PageID #:\n1289\nPlaintiffs may not rely on alleged injury to unnamed putative class members. They “must allege \nand show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, \nunidentified” individuals. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996); Mahon v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 683 F.3d \n59, 64 (2d Cir. 2012) (same). Plaintiffs cannot “show[] that the police [are] likely to do this to [them] \nagain,” as required for seeking prospective injunctive or declaratory relief. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 107; see \nO’Shea, 414 U.S. at 497 (“[A]ttempting to anticipate whether and when these respondents will be \ncharged with crime and will be made to appear before either petitioner takes us into the area of \nspeculation and conjecture.”) (citations omitted). Indeed, Castaneda has been removed from the \nUnited States and Hernandez has been released on bond and is in pending removal proceedings. So \nneither Plaintiff is now subject to a detainer acted upon by Suffolk County, nor is there any alleged \nlikelihood that they will be subject to such a detainer in the future. Plaintiffs’ lack of justification for \nequitable relief also renders their claims as moot, and therefore the Court must dismiss them for lack \nof subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). See, e.g., Fuller v. BIA, 702 F.3d 83, 86 (2d \nCir. 2012) (a claim becomes moot when “event[s] occur … that make[] it impossible for the court to \ngrant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party.”); Xian Yong Zeng on behalf of Tie Liu v. Kerry, \n266 F. Supp. 3d 645, 647 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (“When a court is presented with issues that ‘are no longer \nlive’ or when the parties ‘lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,’ the case is moot.”).7 \nII.  Even if the Court had jurisdiction, Plaintiffs’ claims would need to be dismissed under\n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \n \nA.  Cooperation with ICE Detainers is consistent with federal statutory law \n \nThe INA authorizes cooperation with ICE detainers or administrative transfers if the local \ngovernment acts following a “request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government.” \n                                                 \n7 As the Government argued previously, see ECF 24-1 at 9–14, there are two other reasons why these issues \nare not properly before this Court. First, the INA provides that Plaintiffs must raise their constitutional claims \nin their pending removal proceedings—before the immigration court, before the Board of Immigration \nAppeals, and (if need be) before the Second Circuit. See ECF 24-1 at 11–14; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5), (b)(9), (d). \nSecond, Castaneda is collaterally estopped from re-litigating claims that were already litigated and decided in \nimmigration court. See ECF 24-1 at 14; Oyeniran v. Holder, 672 F.3d 800, 806 (9th Cir. 2012) (doctrine applies to \n“administrative agency’s determination of certain issues of law or fact”). The immigration judge’s decision on \nCastaneda’s claims was necessarily determined antecedent to the IJ’s decision that Castaneda was subject to a \nremoval from the United States. See Umar Oriental Rugs, Inc. v. Carlson & Carlson, Inc., 757 F. Supp. 2d 218, 226 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2010) (Bianco, J.). \n  11 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 22 of 34 PageID #:\n1290\nArizona, 567 U.S. at 410. Upon receiving the request or instruction from ICE, local officers are \npermitted by the INA to “cooperate with the [Secretary] in the identification, apprehension, detention, \nor removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10)(B).  \nThe  SCSO’s  cooperation  with  ICE  detainers  or  administrative  transfers  satisfies  these \nrequirements. First, detainers are “request[s] . . . from the Federal Government” to a State or locality \nto assist its efforts to detain a particular alien, so complying with those requests is necessarily \npermissible cooperation at the federal government’s “request, approval, or other instruction.” Arizona, \n567 U.S. at 410; accord El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 189 (assistance with detainers occurs “only when there is \nalready federal direction—namely, an ICE-detainer request”) (emphasis added); accord Lopez-Lopez v. \nCty. of Allegan, 321 F. Supp. 3d 794, 799 (W.D. Mich. 2018) (similar); Tenorio-Serrano v. Driscoll, 324 F. \nSupp. 3d 1053, 1065 (D. Ariz. 2018) (similar); see also Perez-Ramirez v. Norwood, 322 F. Supp. 3d 1169, \n1171 (D. Kan. 2018) (holding that compliance with ICE detainer was lawful).8  \nLikewise, a request that a locality administratively transfer an alien to ICE custody following \nrelease from state custody when ICE has previously served an arrest warrant is a “request” for \nassistance. SCSO administratively transferred Hernandez to ICE following his second arrest after ICE \npersonally served an arrest warrant on Hernandez, pursuant to federal law, which permits ICE to pay \nlocalities for the housing of aliens arrested and detained by ICE “pursuant to Federal law under an \nagreement” with any locality for “detention services” including “guaranteed bed space for persons \ndetained by the” federal government. 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(11)(A); see, e.g., Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d \n106, 122 (2d Cir. 1998) (although the warden of each detention facility technically has day-to-day \ncontrol over alien detainees, INS District Director for the district where detention facility is located \n“has power over” such alien habeas corpus petitioners); Roman, 340 F.3d at 320–21 (addressing section \n                                                 \n8 Plaintiffs suggest that such cooperation may violate the Tenth Amendment, based on their view that detainers \n“require state and local law enforcement officials to hold individuals in custody.” 2AC ¶ 7. That suggestion is \nwrong. It is well-settled that detainers are requests, and do not compel States and localities to take any action. \nSee, e.g., Galarza v. Szalczyk, 745 F.3d 634, 643 (3d Cir. 2014). But whatever limits there may be on federal \ncompulsion of localities, there is no such compulsion as detainers seek voluntary cooperation, not compulsion. \nAnd even if the federal government cannot compel cooperation by a locality, the county has authority to require \ncounty-wide cooperation with detainers—just as it may impose innumerable other county-wide measures. See, \ne.g., El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 181. And Suffolk County may do so without raising preemption concerns. In short, \neven where the federal government may lack authority to mandate state or local action, States and localities \nmay still use the “powers . . . reserved to the[m],” U.S. Const. amend. X, to accomplish the same end. See City \nof New York v. United States, 179 F.3d 29, 36 (2d Cir. 1999). \n  12 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 23 of 34 PageID #:\n1291\n1103(a)(11)(A) and holding ICE is the proper defendant in habeas cases involving persons detained \nat ICE’s request in state and local contract detention facilities). In short, once ICE served an arrest \nwarrant on Hernandez and later invoked its authority pursuant to the agreement to house Hernandez \nat the SCSO facility at Riverhead, Hernandez was detained there as an ICE detainee subject to ICE’s \ncustody. SCSO’s facilitation of that transfer at ICE’s express request is permitted cooperation under \nfederal law. See, e.g., Abriq v. Nashville, 3:17-cv-690, slip op. at 6–9 (M. D. Tenn. Sept. 17, 2018) \n(observing that section 1357(g)(10) permits “transfer of the detainee [] from state/territorial custody \nto federal custody”). \nSecond, the INA authorizes ICE to request local cooperation “either to hold the prisoner for \nthe agency or to notify the agency when release [] is imminent.” McLean v. Crabtree, 173 F.3d 1176, \n1185 n.12 (9th Cir. 1998) (defining a detainer as a request “to hold the prisoner for the agency or to \nnotify the agency when release of the prisoner is imminent” and holding that DHS “has authority to \nlodge a detainer against a prisoner”); accord El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 188 (similar). This detainer \n“authority,” formalized by 8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(3), 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), and 1357(d), “predates the \nINA and has long been viewed as implied by federal immigration enforcers’ authority to arrest those \nsuspected of being removable.” Santoyo v. United States, No. 16-855, 2017 WL 6033861, *3 (W.D. Tex. \nOct. 18, 2017); see United States v. Gomez-Robles, No. 17-730, 2017 WL 6558595, *3 (D. Ariz. Nov. 28, \n2017) (similar); Mendez v. United States, No. 02 CR 745 (RPP), 2009 WL 4857490, at *1 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. \nDec. 11, 2009) (similar); Comm. for Immigrant Rights of Sonoma Cty. v. Cty. of Sonoma, 644 F. Supp. 2d 1177, \n1199 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (similar); see also Akande v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 659 F. App’x 681, 684 (2d Cir. \n2016) (“[T]he immigration detainer would appear . . . to justify an additional 48 hours of detention \nbeyond the expiration of the prisoner’s term”); Rosario v. New York City, No. 12 Civ. 4795 (PAE), 2013 \nWL 20992547, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 15, 2013) (noting INA “authority to detain [alien] under [] \ndetainer”).  \nCourts have thus recognized that federal law, through the INA in 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10)(B), \npermits local cooperation with federal notification and detention requests. See, e.g., Santos v. Frederick \nCty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 725 F.3d 451, 467 (4th Cir. 2013) (holding local cooperation is lawful when “at \nICE’s express direction”); United States v. Ovando-Garzo, 752 F.3d 1161, 1164 (8th Cir. 2014) (holding \nlocal cooperation without “written agreement” is lawful if it is “not unilateral”); City of S. Miami v. \n  13 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 24 of 34 PageID #:\n1292\nDesantis,  408  F.  Supp.  3d  1266,  1301  (S.D.  Fla.  2019)  (“Based  upon  the  plain  language  of \n§ 1357(g)(10)(B), [the state’s] Detainer Mandate on its face is not preempted because it falls within the \nscope of ‘cooperat[ion]. . . in the . . . detention . . . of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.’”) \n(citing § 1357(g)(10)(B)); Rios v. Jenkins, 390 F. Supp. 3d 714, 725 (W.D. Va. 2019) (holding that Arizona \n“can be read to suggest that . . . detaining an individual in accordance with an ICE detainer” was within \nthe scope of a sheriff’s “authority to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts”); Lopez-\nLopez, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 799 (W.D. Mich. 2018); Comm. for Immigrant Rights of Sonoma Cty. v. Cty. of \nSonoma, 644 F. Supp. 2d 1177 (N.D. Cal. 2009). Cooperation with an immigration detainer “provide[s] \noperational support” to the federal government. Lopez-Lopez, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 799 (citing 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(g)(10)). That action is taken at the “request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal \nGovernment.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 410, and for purposes of liability or immunity from suit, “[a]n officer \nor employee of a State or political subdivision of a State acting under color of authority under this subsection \n. . . shall be considered to be acting under color of Federal authority.” 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(8) (emphases \nadded); see also Arias v. ICE, No. 07-1959, 2008 WL 1827604, *13–15 (D. Minn. Apr. 23, 2008) (joint \nimmigration task force resulting in arrests). Federal law thus does not preempt SCSO’s cooperation \nwith detainers supported by a federal warrant.  \nThird, such cooperation is permitted even if the County lacks a formal 287(g) agreement or \ndoes not satisfy the training and certification requirements that accompany such agreements. As the \nFifth Circuit explained, the INA, through section 1357(g)(10)(B), “indicates that Congress intended \nlocal cooperation without a formal agreement,” and without “a written agreement, training, and direct \nsupervision by DHS . . . in a range of key enforcement functions.” El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 179. That is, \ncooperation with immigration detainers is permitted and envisioned by the INA without any of the \nformal training and certification requirements necessary for “state and local officials [to] become de \nfacto immigration officers, competent to act on their own initiative” under a formal 287(g) agreement. \nId. Likewise, cooperation with ICE through an IGSA pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(11)(A) at ICE’s \nexpress request and after ICE has already served an arrest warrant on the alien previously is permissible \ncooperation under section 1357(g)(10)(B). See La Raza v. Herbert, 26 F. Supp. 3d 1125, 1142 (D. Utah \n2014) (federal law permits and does not preempt state law requiring local law enforcement to transfer \naliens to federal custody following their release from state custody). \n  14 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 25 of 34 PageID #:\n1293\nIndeed, the U.S. Supreme Court in Arizona did not purport to define the outer limits of \ncooperation permitted by section 1357(g)(10). Instead, it listed a number of examples of permissible \ncooperation  that  States  and  localities  may  undertake  without  the  training  and  certification \nrequirements of a formal agreement under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1), including “arrest[ing] an alien for \nbeing removable” if that arrest is made in response to a “request” from the federal government. 567 \nU.S. at 410. Arizona distinguished between such a scenario—which is permissible under section \n1357(g)(10)(B)—and the scenario authorized by the law at issue in Arizona: “unilateral state action to \ndetain . . . aliens in custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and supervision” \nand without any federal “request” to do so. Id. at 410, 413; accord El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 179–80 (state \nlaw requiring cooperation with federal detainers “permit[s] no unilateral enforcement activity” because \ncooperation only occurs following “a predicate federal request for assistance”). \nMoreover, there is no requirement under the INA that a State or locality may cooperate only \nif it has a formal cooperation agreement under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) and its officers are trained and \ncertified under that provision. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10)(B). The Fifth Circuit rejected that assertion, \nEl Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 179–80, and rightly so: Section 1357(g)(10) says that no formal “agreement \nunder” section 1357(g) is required for local officers to “cooperate with” federal immigration officers. \nFormal agreements are quite different from informal cooperation. Under formal agreements, local \nofficers undergo the training necessary to “perform [the] function of an immigration officer,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(g)(1)—allowing them to enforce immigration law without any triggering request from the \nfederal government to do so. See Arizona, 567 U.S. at 409–10 (explaining when DHS “grant[s] that \nauthority to specific officers” through formal agreement). Under section 1357(g)(10), officers not \nsubject to such agreements may still cooperate absent any formal training, so long as such cooperation \nis not “unilateral,” but at the “request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government.” \nId. at 410; see United States v. Ovando-Garzo, 752 F.3d 1161, 1164 (8th Cir. 2014) (argument to the \ncontrary  is  “meritless”).  The  County’s  cooperation  with  federal  immigration  detainers  or \nadministrative transfers thus presumes that such cooperation will occur consistent with federal law, \nbecause a detainer “always requires a predicate federal request before local officers may detain aliens \nfor the additional 48 hours.” El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 189 (emphasis added); see New York, 2020 WL \n911417, at *7 n.10. \n  15 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 26 of 34 PageID #:\n1294\nCooperation is thus permitted irrespective of whether it is directed by a state statute or by a \nlocal sheriff: in neither case does it exceed the bounds of the cooperation permitted by Congress. See \nArizona, 567 U.S. at 410, 413 (affirming state legislative mandate “requiring state officials to contact \nICE as a routine matter”). The only limitation is that state-mandated cooperation may not “authorize \nstate and local officers to engage in [] enforcement activities as a general matter” without “any input \nfrom the Federal Government.” Id. at 408, 410. While “unilateral decision[s] of state officers to arrest \nan alien for being removable” are preempted, cooperation under a “request, approval, or other \ninstruction from the Federal Government” is not. Id. at 410. Courts have thus recognized that federal \nlaw permits States and localities to cooperate, without formal training or certification, with federal \nrequests to detain a removable alien. See, e.g., El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 180 (holding that “[s]tate action \nunder” the state-law provision requiring local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement does \n“not conflict with federal priorities or limit federal discretion [] because it requires a predicate federal \nrequest,”  and  therefore  “does  not  permit  local  officials  to  act  without  federal  direction  and \nsupervision”); Ovando-Garzo, 752 F.3d at 1164 (cooperation without “written agreement” is lawful if \n“not unilateral”). Federal statutory law thus permits the County’s cooperation with detainers or \nadministrative transfer requests here because that cooperation is not unilateral and occurs following a \nrequest or direction from the federal government.  \nB.  Cooperation with ICE Detainers is consistent with the Fourth Amendment, \n the Fourteenth Amendment and thus also with Article I, Section 12 of the New \n York Constitution \n \nThe cooperation at issue here is also permitted under the Fourth Amendment, the Fourteenth \nAmendment,9 and the New York State Constitution. At the outset, as the New York Court of Appeals \n                                                 \n9 Where a party raises both Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to the same nexus of events, as \nhere, the “independent” Fourteenth Amendment due process claim collapses into the Fourth Amendment \nclaim and cannot serve as a separate, freestanding claim. See Bryant v. City of New York, 404 F.3d 128, 135–36 \n(2d Cir. 2005); Rios, 390 F. Supp. 3d at 722. Indeed, as the Supreme Court explained, “[i]f the complaint is that \na form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly \ninfringed lies in the Fourth Amendment,” and not the “due process clause.” Manuel v. City of Joliet, 137 S. Ct. \n911, 919 (2017). Moreover, a prerequisite to any due process claim, whether procedural or substantive, is an \nassertion of a cognizable liberty or property interest. See, e.g., Gravitte v. N. Carolina Div. of Motor Vehicles, 33 F. \nApp’x 45, 48 (4th Cir. 2002). But the lodging of any detainer generally has no “immediate effect upon protected \nliberty interests,” because the subject of a detainer is “not entitled to a hearing prior to the execution of the \nwarrant or to compelled execution of the warrant” on which the detainer relies. Heath v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 788 \n  16 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 27 of 34 PageID #:\n1295\nhas explained, Article I, Section 12 of the New York Constitution is interpreted co-extensively with \nthe Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. People v. P.J. Video, Inc., 68 N.Y.2d 296, 304 (N.Y. \n1986). “[T]he history of section 12 supports the presumption that the provision against unlawful \nsearches and seizures contained in N.Y. Constitution, article I, § 12 conforms with that found in the \n4th Amendment, and that this identity of language supports a policy of uniformity between State and \nFederal courts.” Id. Accordingly, the Fourth Amendment and its New York equivalent are analyzed \nthe same way in this context. People v. Xirum, 45 Misc. 3d 785, 787 (N.Y. Sup. Ct 2014); see People v.  P.J. \nVideo, 68 N.Y.2d 296, 304 (1986); People v. Johnson, 66 N.Y.2d 398, 406 (N.Y. 1985). For ease of \nreference, the United States will generally refer only to the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Hafez v. City \nof Schenectady, 894 F. Supp. 2d 207, 219 n.20 (N.D.N.Y. 2012) (“[I]f the Court finds that Plaintiff’s \nFourth Amendment rights have not been violated, it will also conclude that Plaintiff’s parallel rights \nunder the New York State Constitution have not been violated.”). \nThree points establish that local cooperation with detainers or administrative transfers accords \nwith  both  the  Fourth  Amendment  and  its  New  York  equivalent:  (1) federal  officials  can \nconstitutionally arrest aliens under a federal administrative warrant (which accompanies each ICE \ndetainer); (2) the lawfulness of that practice does not change when local officials help effectuate such \nan arrest at ICE’s request; and (3) local officials may constitutionally rely upon federal officials’ \n                                                 \nF.2d 85, 91 (2d Cir. 1986); see Nasious v. Two Unkonwn B.I.C.E. Agents at Arapahoe Cty. Justice Ctr., 657 F. Supp. \n2d 1218, 1223, 1225, aff’d, 366 F. App’x 894 (“Plaintiff’s detention was imposed by the state of Colorado based \non Plaintiff’s pending criminal charges; it was not imposed by or in any way impacted by the ICE detainer,” \nand “the ICE detainer could not, as a matter of law, constitute a restraint on or deprivation of a liberty”); Keil \nv. Spinella, 2011 WL 43491, *8–9 (S.D. Mo. Jan. 6, 2011) (“[A] detainer alone does not cause imprisonment or \na seizure by ICE. Rather, a seizure only occurs when the agency to which the detainer was issued turns custody \nover to ICE.”). This is especially true in the immigration context. Removable aliens generally lack any due \nprocess right to be free from detention pending resolution of their removal proceedings until such detention \nbecomes prolonged. See Soberanes v. Comfort, 388 F.3d 1305, 1311 (10th Cir. 2004). Until it does, detention \nremains “a constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process,” and impinges on no cognizable liberty \ninterest. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 523 (2003). That is true whether the custodian of that detention is the \nfederal government or a State or locality. See, e.g., Themeus v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 643 F. App’x 830, 832-33 (11th \nCir. 2016). To be sure, aliens who are not subject to mandatory detention may challenge their ongoing detention \nin their removal proceedings and seek release on bond. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a); 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1(c)(8), \n236.1(d)(1), 287.3(d). They may also seek to terminate their removal proceedings based on a pre-removal \nproceeding “deprivation of fundamental rights,” including their Fourteenth Amendment rights. But the \nremedies available in removal proceedings do not create a freestanding due process right to avoid immigration \ndetention. See Demore, 538 U.S. at 523. And absent such a cognizable liberty interest, there can be no procedural \ndue process violation in the first place. See Gravitte, 33 F. App’x at 48. Thus, any claimed Fourteenth Amendment \nchallenge fails.  \n \n  17 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 28 of 34 PageID #:\n1296\nprobable-cause determinations. \nFirst, the “Fourth Amendment does not require warrants to be based on probable cause of a \ncrime, as opposed to a civil offense.” United States v. Phillips, 834 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir. 2016) \n(collecting examples, including bench warrants for civil contempt and writs of replevin); see, e.g., United \nStates v. Spencer, 684 F.2d 220, 223 (2d Cir. 1982) (ruling that a New York statute authorizing police \nofficers to execute civil bench warrants satisfies the Fourth Amendment). Arrests may be premised \non probable cause of any legal violation, whether civil or criminal. See, e.g., El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 188 \n(collecting other constitutionally valid examples, including seizures of the mentally ill, those who pose \na danger to themselves, and juvenile runaways); Lopez-Lopez, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 799 (“In fact, \nindividuals may be arrested for any violation of law—civil or criminal.”); Perez-Ramirez, 322 F. Supp. \n3d at 1172 (“[T]he legality of an arrest of an alien based upon a civil immigration violation is well-\nestablished.”). Indeed, given that “[i]n determining whether a search or seizure is unreasonable, \n[courts] begin with history,” including “statutes and common law of the founding era,” Virginia v. \nMoore, 553 U.S. 164, 168 (2008), that understanding is especially settled in the immigration context. \nThere is an “overwhelming historical legislative recognition of the propriety of administrative arrest[s] \nfor deportable aliens.” Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 233 (1960); see, e.g., Lopez v. INS, 758 F.2d \n1390, 1393 (10th Cir. 1985) (aliens “may be arrested by administrative warrant issued without order \nof a magistrate”); New York, 2020 WL 911417, at *7 n.10. \nPlaintiffs allege that detainers and administrative warrants “violate the Fourth Amendment’s \nrequirement that an individual arrested without a warrant be brought before a neutral magistrate for a \nprobable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest.” Id. ¶ 78. They are mistaken. Given the civil context \nof federal immigration detainers, an executive immigration officer can constitutionally make the \nnecessary probable-cause determination. It is well-settled that the term “magistrate” as it is understood \nin the arrest and presentment context is not limited to judicial officers; it in fact encompasses any \n“public civil officer, possessing such power—legislative, executive, or judicial—as the government \nappointing him may ordain.” Shadwick v. City of Tampa, 407 U.S. 345, 349 (1972); see Compton v. State of \nAlabama, 214 U.S. 1, 7 (1909) (“the appellation of magistrate is not confined to justices of the peace, \nand other persons, ejusdem generis, who exercise general judicial powers; but it includes others whose \nduties are strictly executive”) (emphasis added).  \n  18 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 29 of 34 PageID #:\n1297\nIndeed, it has long been the case that federal immigration officials in the Executive Branch \nmay function as magistrates by issuing administrative warrants under federal statutes authorizing them \nto do so. See, e.g., Abel, 362 U.S. at 234; El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 187; accord Sherman v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, \n502 F.3d 869, 876–80 (9th Cir. 2007) (in immigration context, warrants may be issued “outside the \nscope of the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause”); Lopez, 758 F.2d at 1393 (recognizing the validity \nof an “administrative warrant issued without an order of a magistrate”). And if Plaintiffs are brought \ninto ICE custody, they may challenge their custody or removal proceedings before the “magistrate,” \ni.e. ICE, as well as the immigration courts. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226, 1229(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1(c)(8), \n236.1(d)(1), 287.3(d). Given the civil context of immigration detainers, an executive officer can \nconstitutionally make the necessary probable-cause determination outside the scope of the Fourth \nAmendment’s Warrant Clause “without presentment to a judicial officer.” Sherman v. U.S. Parole \nComm’n, 502 F.3d at 876–80; accord United States v. Lucas, 499 F.3d 769, 776 (8th Cir. 2007) (en banc) \n(plurality) (administrative warrants need not be issued by a “neutral and detached magistrate in the \nsense of a judicial officer”); U.S. ex rel. Randazzo v. Follette, 418 F.2d 1319, 1322 (2d Cir. 1969) (a parole \nviolator warrant designated as “administrative” under New York law was not subject to ordinary \nFourth Amendment safeguards and thus did “not depend upon a showing of probable cause”); Spinella \nv. Esperdy, 188 F. Supp. 535, 540–41 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (noting “unsoundness” of argument to the \ncontrary). “[L]egislation giving authority to the Attorney General or his delegate to arrest aliens \npending deportation proceedings under an administrative warrant, not a judicial warrant within the \nscope of the Fourth Amendment,” has existed “from almost the beginning of the Nation.” Abel, 362 \nU.S. at 234.  \nSecond, because the Fourth Amendment allows federal immigration officers to arrest and detain \nbased on an administrative warrant attesting to probable cause of removability, state and local officials \ncan do the same when they act at the request or direction of the federal government. The Fourth \nAmendment does not apply differently when a local official, rather than a federal official, is detaining. \n“The Fourth Amendment’s meaning [does] not change with local law enforcement practices.” Moore, \n553 U.S. at 172. To hold otherwise would cause Fourth Amendment “protections [to] vary if federal \nofficers were not subject to the same statutory constraints as state officers.” Id. at 176.  \nA police officer’s “violation of [state] law [in arresting alien based on a violation of federal \n  19 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 30 of 34 PageID #:\n1298\nimmigration law] does not constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment.” Martinez-Medina v. Holder, \n673 F.3d 1029, 1037 (9th Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs’ contention is incorrect that People ex rel. Wells v. DeMarco, \n168 A.D.3d 31, 88 N.Y.S.3d 518 (N.Y. App. Div. 2018), is dispositive here. See ECF 72. Wells is only \ncontrolling in one of New York’s state appellate division and relies on interpretations of New York \nlaw. Wells does not affect this Court’s analysis. See United States v. Bernacet, 724 F.3d 269, 276–77 (2d \nCir. 2013) (explaining that if a seizure is legal under the Fourth Amendment when a federal officer \neffectuates it, then it is also constitutional when a state or local officer does so, even where state law \ndoes not authorize the arrest, because “state restrictions do not alter the Fourth Amendment’s \nprotections”). In addition, the Supreme Court has stated that “[t]he Fourth Amendment’s meaning \n[does] not change with local law enforcement practices.” Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 172 (2008). \nTo hold otherwise would cause Fourth Amendment “protections [to] vary if federal officers were not \nsubject to the same statutory constraints as state officers.” Id. at 176.   \nThe legality of any seizure by a local officer is especially apparent where, as here, a local officer \nis detaining for a federal offense at the express request of the federal government supported by a \nfederal warrant. Thus, any suggestion that the Fourth Amendment bars local—but not federal—\nofficers from detaining aliens based upon probable cause of removability alone is incorrect. Such \narrests are lawful if probable cause of removability exists and the officer does not act unilaterally. See, \ne.g., El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 179-80, 1889 (state law requiring cooperation with ICE detainers “permit[s] \nno unilateral enforcement activity” because cooperation only occurs following “a predicate federal \nrequest for assistance” supported by “probable cause”); Sanchez v. Sessions, 885 F.3d 782, 789 (4th Cir. \n2018) (“[W]hen, absent federal direction or authorization, a state or local officer detains or arrests someone \nbased solely on a civil immigration violation, the officer violates that individual’s Fourth Amendment \nright to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.”) (first emphasis added)); Rios, 390 F. Supp. \n3d at 727 (“[N]o circuit had held that it would violate the Fourth Amendment to comply with an ICE \ndetainer and administrative warrant. The same is true today.”); Ovando-Garzo, 752 F.3d at 1164 \n(cooperation  without  “written  agreement”  lawful  if  “not  unilateral;”  argument  to  the  contrary \n“meritless”); Tenorio-Serrano, 324 F. Supp. 3d at 1066 (“if such arrests do not violate the Fourth \nAmendment when made by federal officers, they do not violate the Fourth Amendment when made \nby state officers”); Lopez-Lopez, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 801 (dismissing identical lawsuit because there is \n  20 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 31 of 34 PageID #:\n1299\nno “plausible Fourth Amendment” claim that can be raised if state officer cooperates with a detainer \nand administrative warrant showing probable cause of removability); cf. Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d \n990, 1001 (9th Cir. 2012) (detention of removable aliens is unilateral absent a formal agreement or \nrequest for cooperation from federal government). \nThe same would be true where a state or locality, relying on a request from the federal \ngovernment supported by a detainer and administrative warrant, transfers an alien in their custody to \nfederal custody, as occurred to Hernandez following his second criminal arrest. A Fourth Amendment \nseizure only occurs when a new “governmental termination of freedom of movement through means \nintentionally applied” occurs. Brower v. Cty. of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596–97 (1989). But at the time \nHernandez was eligible for release on his second arrest on March 30, 2018, his freedom of movement \nhad already been terminated. SCSO’s administrative transfer of Hernandez from its custody to ICE \npursuant to the IGSA does not effect a new seizure, and even if it did, it was supported by the probable \ncause contained in the detainer and administrative warrant. See, e.g., Coleman v. Gillespie, 424 F. App’x \n267, 270 (5th Cir. 2011) (transfer of arrestee from custody of one officer to another does not effect a \nseparate arrest or seizure.); United States v. Laville, 480 F.3d 187, 196 (3d Cir. 2007) (custodial transfer \ndoes not constitute a new arrest requiring a separate showing of probable cause); U.S. ex rel. Vanorsby \nv. Acevedo, No. 11 C 7384, 2012 WL 3686787, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 24, 2012) (“Once an individual has \nbeen lawfully taken into custody, he has been seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment; merely \ntransferring custody of that individual from one law enforcement agency to another deprives him of \nnothing he has not already lost”); Brown v. Venango Cty., No. 09–268, 2010 WL 5293906, *5 (W.D. Pa. \nDec. 17, 2010) (transfer of federal prisoner to local custody did not constitute a Fourth Amendment \nseizure by local authorities because prisoner “had already been ‘seized’ for purposes of the Fourth \nAmendment”). \nThird, arrests or detentions based on probable cause may lawfully be effected where the \nprobable-cause determination is made by one official (here, a federal ICE officer) and relied on by \nanother official who serves under a different sovereign (here, a local SCSO officer). Put differently, \nlocal  officers  may  rely  on  ICE’s  findings  of  probable  cause,  as  articulated  in  a  detainer  and \nadministrative warrant, to detain the subject of a detainer when the federal government so requests. \nWhere one officer obtains an arrest warrant based on probable cause, other officers can make the \n  21 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 80     Filed 03/03/20     Page 32 of 34 PageID #:\n1300\narrest even if they are “unaware of the specific facts that established probable cause.” United States v. \nHensley, 469 U.S. 221, 231 (1985). All that is required is that “sufficient information to justify the arrest \nor search was known by other law enforcement officials initiating or involved with the investigation.” \nUnited States v. Colon, 250 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Fleming, No. 18-CR-197 (KAM), \n2019 WL 486073, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, 2019) (“Under the [collective knowledge] doctrine, a police \nofficer may act reasonably in relying on information from other law enforcement officers, even if he \nis not personally aware of the facts that provided the probable cause underlying the information he \nreceived.”) (citation omitted); cf. Hernandez v. United States, 939 F.3d 191, 209 (2d Cir. 2019) (“The \ncollective knowledge doctrine does not help the City because, as the Complaint plausibly alleges, the \nDHS officer] who instigated Hernandez’s detention [] lacked probable cause to issue the detainer and \nhe failed to conduct an inquiry when a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have inquired.”). \nThus, an officer may arrest someone, even when the officer does not know the facts establishing \nprobable cause, if the officer reasonably believed that the arrestee was the subject of a federal warrant. \nSee, e.g., id.; United States v. Polito, 583 F.2d 48, 51–52 (2d Cir 1978). \n  This rule of collective law-enforcement knowledge applies when “the communication [is] \nbetween federal and state or local authorities,” 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 3.5(b) (2016) \n(collecting cases); People v. Rosario, 78 N.Y.2d 583, 588–89 (N.Y. 1991), including when a state or local \nofficer arrests someone based upon probable cause from information received from an immigration \nofficer. See El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 188 (“Compliance with an ICE detainer [] constitutes a paradigmatic \ninstance of the collective-knowledge doctrine, where the detainer request itself provides the required \ncommunication between the arresting officer and an officer who has knowledge of all the necessary \nfacts.”); Mendoza v. U.S. ICE, 849 F.3d 408, 419 (8th Cir. 2017) (“County employees . . . reasonably \nrelied on [ICE agent’s] probable cause determination for the detainer.”); Tenorio-Serrano v. Driscoll, 324 \nF. Supp. 3d at 1066 (“[T]he [local] officer is acting on the probable cause determination of a federal \nofficer empowered and trained to make such determinations.”). Indeed, most courts that have \nconsidered cooperation with federal immigration detainers where those detainers are supported by \nprobable cause of removability have found such cooperation permitted or not prohibited by state law. \nSee Ovando-Garzo, 752 F.3d at 1164; El Cenizo, 890 F.3d at 189; Santos, 725 F.3d at 467; Rios, 390 F. \nSupp. 3d at 725; Chery v. Sheriff of Nassau Cty., No. 8100/15, 2015 WL 13665005, at *4 (N.Y. Sup.

An arresting officer “who acts in reliance on [another officer] is not required to have \npersonal knowledge of the evidence creating a reasonable suspicion.” Hensley, 469 U.S. at 231. And \n“an ICE-detainer request evidences probable cause of removability in every instance.” El Cenizo, 890 \nF.3d at 187.10   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint in its entirety. \nDated: March 3, 2020          Respectfully submitted, \n \nJOSEPH H.

The State therefore seeks an opportunity to respond to defendants’ \nand the United States’ erroneous legal contentions.  \nWhen the defendants in this action originally moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ operative \ncomplaint, this Court granted the State’s motion for leave to file an amicus brief responding to the \nlegal contentions defendants and the United States presented at that time, and permitted the State’s \nparticipation in oral argument that had been scheduled on the motion to dismiss. Minute Order \n(Oct. 24, 2018); Minute Order (Nov. 15, 2018). The Court thereafter postponed argument at the \nparties’ request, in order to facilitate settlement discussions. Minute Order (Dec. 10, 2018); Minute \nOrder (Jan. 29, 2018). After the settlement discussions were unsuccessful, defendants filed the \nrenewed motion to dismiss now pending before the Court. The State thus now requests to file an \namicus brief responsive to the renewed motion and the statement of interest the United States filed \nin support of that motion. \nAlthough the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide no standard for the filing of amicus \nbriefs in district court, federal appellate courts recognize the value of States’ participation as amici \nin general, permitting States to file amicus briefs as of right. See Sup. Ct. R. 37.4; Fed. R. App. P. \n29(a)(2). Moreover, district courts in this Circuit grant leave to file an amicus brief if the brief will \nhelp protect interests of the amicus that will be affected by the case before the court, see, e.g., \nAutomobile Club of N.Y., Inc. v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 11-cv-6746, 2011 WL 5865296, at \n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2011), or if the amicus brief will “assist[] the court by, inter alia, providing \na point of view that may not be available from the parties,” e.g., McBeth v. Gabrielli Truck Sales, \nLtd., 768 F. Supp. 2d 392, 394 (E.D.N.Y. 2011); see also Russell v. Board of Plumbing Exam’rs \nof Cty. of Westchester, 74 F. Supp. 2d 349, 351 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), aff’d, 1 F. App’x 38 (2d Cir. \n2001) (summary order). The State’s proposed amicus brief will do both. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 83     Filed 04/24/20     Page 3 of 3 PageID #:\n1315\nThe State’s proposed amicus brief will help protect the State’s strong interests in ensuring \nproper interpretation of the state law it is charged to enforce, and defending the rights of New \nYorkers. In addition, the proposed amicus brief will assist the Court by setting forth important \ndetail regarding state constitutional, statutory, and common law that has not been presented by the \nparties. \nFor all the foregoing reasons, the State’s consent motion for leave to file the attached \namicus brief should be granted. \nDated this 24th day of April, 2020. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  LETITIA JAMES  \n    Attorney General \n    State of New York  \n   \n  By:  /s/ Lillian Marquez \n    Lillian Marquez \n    Assistant Attorney General \n    28 Liberty Street \n    New York, NY 10005 \n    (212) 416-6401 \n  lillian.marquez@ag.ny.gov \n   \nJessica Clarke  Barbara D.

Kelly, \nElaine C. Duke, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas D. Homan, Matthew T. \nAlbence, County of Suffolk, Steven Bellone, Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, Vincent F. DeMarco, \nand other individuals in charge to be identified (collectively, “Defendants”), and alleges as follows: \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n1. On April 26, 2017, Defendant United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(“ICE”) obtained custody of Plaintiff, Mr. Orellana, in knowing reliance on an unconstitutional \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 2 of 17 PageID #: 95\nscheme deployed by Defendant Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office (“SCSO”), at ICE’s request, to \nmaintain  custody  over  Mr.  Orellana  beyond  his  scheduled  release  date  simply  for  ICE’s \nadministrative convenience, without the required statutory, judicial, or constitutional authority to \ndo so.   \n2.  Though  Mr.  Orellana  paid  the  bail  set  by  the  local  district  court,  the  SCSO \nunlawfully extended his detention, and ICE has yet to release him from its custody since then. \n3.  By this complaint (“Complaint”), Mr. Orellana challenges ICE’s policy and practice \nof issuing detainers requesting that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies continue to \ndetain individuals well after any other basis for custody has expired, simply for ICE’s administrative \nconvenience.  ICE’s statutory authority to issue detainers without a judicially authorized arrest \nwarrant is expressly limited, as set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1357(d), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), and 8 U.S.C. \n1357(a), to situations other than the instant case.  As detailed below, ICE’s issuance of these \ndetainers (“ICE detainers”) regularly exceeds its statutory authority. \n4.  By this Complaint, Mr. Orellana also challenges the policy and practice of the SCSO \nand its officials of complying with these ICE detainers by detaining individuals without judicial \nauthorization well past the time when they were due to be released, policies that led to Mr. Orellana \nbeing  so  harshly,  and  unjustly,  deprived  of  his  freedom,  his  family  and  his  livelihood,  all \ndeprivations he seeks to remedy by this action.  This detention, unsupported by probable cause and \nwithout  due  process  protections,  violates  Mr.  Orellana’s  rights  under  the  Fourth,  Fifth,  and \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and under the First Article of the New \nYork Constitution. \n2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 3 of 17 PageID #: 96\n5.  ICE justified its detainer request based solely on its initiation of an investigation to \ndetermine whether Mr. Orellana was subject to removal from the United States.  ICE did not \naccompany Mr. Orellana’s detainer with a judicial arrest warrant or a final removal order.   \n6.  On information and belief, ICE has no procedures in place to ensure that the subjects \nof detainers receive adequate notice of the detainers’ terms.  Moreover, even though the detainer \nform states that “the alien must be served with a copy of this form,” neither ICE nor SCSO provided \nMr. Orellana with a copy of his ICE detainer until several days after it was issued.  Nor did ICE \nprovide Mr. Orellana with any practical means to challenge the ICE detainer lodged against him.   \n7.  Mr. Orellana seeks damages under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(a), under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution, and under the First Article of the New York Constitution for the violation of his rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.  This Court also \nhas supplemental jurisdiction over this action’s New York Constitution claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367 because those claims are so related to the claims arising under the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United \nStates Constitution. \n9.  This Court has authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n10.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because \na substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred, and continue \nto occur, in this District. \n11.  Venue is also proper in this judicial district because Plaintiff resides in this District. \n3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 4 of 17 PageID #: 97\nPARTIES \n12.  At the time this action was commenced, Plaintiff Joaquin Orellana Castaneda was a \n34-year old citizen of Guatemala residing in the United States and detained at the Bergen County \nJail in Hackensack, New Jersey under the authority of ICE.  Mr. Orellana was and is a resident of \nSuffolk County, New York, \n13.  Mr. Orellana was arrested in the early morning hours of April 23, 2017 in Central \nIslip, New York, and questioned by members of the Suffolk County police department as to his \nimmigration status.  That same day, Mr. Orellana was brought before a Suffolk County judge, who \nset Mr. Orellana’s bail at $1000 and remanded him to the custody of the SCSO.  Mr. Orellana spent \nthe remainder of the day and night at Yaphank Correctional Facility (“Yaphank”) in Yaphank, New \nYork.   \n14.  The next day, April 24, 2017, Mr. Orellana was interviewed by ICE agents while \nunder SCSO custody at Yaphank.  Mr. Orellana was told that if he paid his bail, then he would be \nreleased and would eventually have to appear at an immigration hearing.  That same day, Mr. \nOrellana’s cousin paid Mr. Orellana’s bail.  A true and correct copy of the bail receipt is attached \nhereto as Exhibit A.   \n15.  However, no one informed Mr. Orellana that his bail had been paid, and SCSO \ncontinued to hold Mr. Orellana at Yaphank pursuant to an ICE detainer after his bail had been paid. \nSCSO did not serve Mr. Orellana with a copy of the detainer at that time. A true and correct copy \nof Mr. Orellana’s detainer and accompanying I-200 administrative warrant is attached hereto as \nExhibit B.  Though it is dated April 24, 2017, the certificate of service at the bottom is blank.   \n16.  On April 25, 2016, while Mr. Orellana remained at Yaphank, a member of SCSO \ntold him that there was a change in his paperwork, and gave no further explanation.  The next day, \n4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 5 of 17 PageID #: 98\nApril 26, 2017, Mr. Orellana was transferred from Yaphank to the Riverhead Correctional Facility \n(“Riverhead”) in Riverhead, New York.   \n17.  Upon information and belief, on or about April 27, 2017 (and certainly well after \nMr. Orellana should have been released from custody due to the payment of his bail), Mr. Orellana \nwas transferred into ICE’s custody, and taken from Riverhead to ICE’s Varick Street Detention \nCenter (“Varick Street”) in New York, New York. There, Mr. Orellana was questioned by ICE \nagents and given forms to sign.  Those forms included another copy of the I-200 warrant that had \naccompanied his detainer, but this time the I-200 was dated (by the ICE officer, not by Mr. Orellana) \nApril 26, 2017. A true and correct copy of this second I-200 is attached hereto as Exhibit C. Later \nthat night, Mr. Orellana was transferred from Varick Street to the Bergen County Jail. \n18.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a federal cabinet \nagency,  a Department of the Executive Branch of the United States Government, and is an agency \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  DHS houses the office of ICE and ICE’s division of \nEnforcement and Removal Operations, the entities which issue the I-247 immigration detainers to \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement.  DHS is ultimately responsible for how immigration \nregulations are applied and the approval of the use of the standard I-247 detainer form under which \npurported authority the Plaintiff was detained.  DHS and/or its employees, agents, or representatives \nare involved in the violations of constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n19.  Defendant John F. Kelly (“Kelly”) is the Secretary of DHS.  Defendant Kelly is, \namong other responsibilities, charged with the constitutional and lawful implementation of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq., and with the administration of the \ndivision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 6 of 17 PageID #: 99\n20.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke (“Duke”) is the Deputy Secretary of the DHS.  Defendant \nDuke is, among other responsibilities, charged with the constitutional and lawful implementation \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq., and with the administration of \nthe division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n21.  Defendant ICE is a subdivision of DHS.  ICE is an agency within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(f).  ICE and/or its employees, agents, or representatives are involved in the violations \nof constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n22.  Defendant  Thomas  D.  Homan  (“Homan”)  is  the  Acting  Director  of  the  U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.  Defendant Homan is, among other responsibilities, \ncharged with the constitutional and lawful implementation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq., and with the administration of the division of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n23.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence (“Albence”) is the Executive Associate Director of \nthe  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement.    Defendant  Albence  is,  among  other \nresponsibilities, charged with the constitutional and lawful implementation of the Immigration and \nNationality  Act,  8  U.S.C.  §§  1101,  et  seq.,  and  with  the  administration  of  the  division  of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n24.  Defendant County of Suffolk (“County”) is a duly constituted municipal corporation \nof the State of New York.  Upon information and belief, the County has direct authority over \nDefendant SCSO.  The County and/or its employees, agents or representatives are involved in the \nviolations of constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 7 of 17 PageID #:\n100\n25.  Defendant Steven Bellone (“Bellone”) is the County Executive of the County of \nSuffolk.  Defendant Bellone is, among other responsibilities, charged with the administration of the \nCounty of Suffolk.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n26.  Defendant SCSO is an entity, agency, department, and/or subdivision of the County.  \nThe SCSO and/or its employees, agents or representatives are involved in the violations of \nconstitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n27.  Defendant Vincent F. DeMarco (“DeMarco”) is the Sheriff of Suffolk County and \npresides over the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office as its chief executive officer.  He has held this \nposition since November 8, 2005.  Upon information and belief, Defendant DeMarco has direct \nauthority over the SCSO.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n28.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a), DHS, through its division of ICE, purports to have \nthe authority to issue detainers in accordance with the intent and requirements of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (“INA”). \n29.  SCSO  has  stated  that  its  policy—unlike  that  of  many  other  law  enforcement \nagencies—is to comply with detainer requests by holding the individuals in question for up to 48 \nhours past the time when they would otherwise be released to allow ICE to decide whether to take \ncustody of a detainee and then take custody of those it chooses.  \n30.  For its part, and according to its Acting Director, Thomas Homan, as of June 13, \n2017 ICE has increased the issuance of detainers 75 percent compared with the same time period \nin 2016.  Relatedly, a Washington Post article reports that ICE has deputized over 40 local law \nenforcement agencies to help ICE enforce immigration law, and that besides conducting its own \nsearches, ICE uses a fingerprint-sharing program to learn when an undocumented immigrant has \nbeen arrested by state or local authorities. \n7 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 8 of 17 PageID #:\n101\n31.  On  the  detainer  that  was  issued  against  Mr.  Orellana,  ICE  officials  justified \ncontinued detention of Mr. Orellana on the sole ground that “there is reason to believe that the \nsubject is a removable alien,” which is a civil, not a criminal, violation of the INA.  The detainer \nrequests that SCSO:  \nMaintain custody of the alien for a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS \nbeyond the time when he/she would otherwise have been released from your \ncustody to allow DHS to assume custody. The alien must be served with a copy \nof this form for the detainer to take effect.  \n \n32.  Mr. Orellana’s detainer was not issued pursuant to a warrant of arrest in removal \nproceedings  or  a  deportation  order.    Furthermore,  on  information  and  belief  ICE  had  no \nparticularized reasons to believe that the specific detainee at issue was likely to escape before a \nwarrant could be obtained for his arrest the only circumstance in which ICE may detain an alien \nwithout a warrant.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).  The completed detainer lists no such particularized \nreasons. \n33.  Neither ICE nor SCSO provides an administrative procedure for challenging the \nissuance of a detainer.  Likewise, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has ruled that it does \nnot have jurisdiction to consider challenges to detainers because it has found that individuals held \non detainers are not in federal immigration custody.  \n34.  The detainer contains a paragraph entitled “notice to the detainee,” which reads as \nfollows: \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has placed an immigration detainer \non you. An immigration detainer is a notice to a law enforcement agency that DHS \nintends to assume custody of you (after you otherwise would be released from \ncustody) because there is probable cause that you are subject to removal from the \nUnited States under federal immigration law. DHS has requested that the law \nenforcement agency that is currently detaining you maintain custody of you for a \nperiod not to exceed 48 hours beyond the time when you would have been released \nbased on your criminal charges or convictions. If DHS does not take you into \ncustody  during  this  additional  48  hour  period,  you  should  contact  your \n8 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 9 of 17 PageID #:\n102\ncustodian (the agency that is holding you now) to inquire about your release. If \nyou believe you are a United States citizen or the victim of a crime, please \nadvise DHS by calling the ICE Law Enforcement Support Center toll free at \n(855) 448-6903. \n \n35.  Thus, even if Mr. Orellana had timely received a copy of his detainer (which he did \nnot) this notice does not constitute adequate due process.  Among other things, the inclusion of a \nhotline number on a notice (written in a language Mr. Orellana does not speak) for certain specific \nproblems, even if Mr. Orellana had been able to call it, did not afford him an adequate opportunity \nto challenge his detention.   \n36.  The detainer form states that ICE “requests” that SCSO detain the individual for an \nadditional 48 hours so that ICE can assume direct, physical custody of the individual.  However, \nthe regulation cited on the detainer form mandates that any local law enforcement agency, like the \nSCSO, detain the individual on ICE’s behalf.  The regulation states:  “such [criminal justice] agency \nshall maintain custody of the alien for a period not to exceed 48 hours . . . in order to permit \nassumption of custody by [ICE].”  8 C.F.R. § 287.7(d) (emphasis added).  This regulation, as set \nforth below, violates the United States and New York Constitution and exceeds the statutory \nauthority pursuant to which it is promulgated. \n37.  The SCSO is well aware that numerous state and federal courts have found law \nenforcement agencies liable for Fourth Amendment violations where they have held individuals \npursuant to detainers.  Indeed, in or about 2014, Suffolk County’s own attorney advised local \nauthorities against the honoring of detainers unless accompanied by a judicial warrant.  \n38.  In or about February 2017, the New York State Sheriffs’ Association (of which \nSCSO is a member) commissioned a comprehensive review of the relevant case law in light of the \nissuance by ICE of its new detainer form.  The Association’s report concluded that “[s]heriffs \nshould not detain persons beyond their normal release date based on a federal detainer warrant, even \n9 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 10 of 17 PageID #:\n103\nif accompanied by an order of deportation or removal, unless there is also a judicial warrant.” \n(emphasis added).  A true and correct copy of the Sheriffs’ Association Report and analysis is \nattached hereto as Exhibit D. \n39.  The SCSO, undeterred, has continued to comply with detainers, and, as in the case \nof Mr. Orellana, to detain individuals even beyond the time requested under the detainer.  The SCSO \nappears similarly untroubled by the New York State Attorney General’s earlier conclusion (which \npost-dates the introduction of the new detainer forms) that “[a]bsent a judicial warrant, [local law \nenforcement agencies] should honor ICE or [Customs and Border Protection] detainer requests only \nin limited, specific circumstances,” meaning “a showing of probable cause that the individual \ncommitted a crime or that an exception to the probable cause requirement applies.” (emphasis \nadded) A true and correct copy of the New York State Attorney General’s report is attached hereto \nas Exhibit E. \n40.  In short, the SCSO knows, or has reason to know, that complying with detainers is \nunlawful.  Thus, its continued honoring of ICE detainers is a willful violation of Plaintiff’s statutory \nand constitutional rights. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D)  \n(Against ICE, DHS, Kelly, Duke, Homan, Albence) \n41.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 40 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n42.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D) requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law;  contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or \nimmunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \n10 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 11 of 17 PageID #:\n104\n[or] without observance of procedure required by law.” \n43.  ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to restrict its issuance of detainers to \nits authority under the INA caused Mr. Orellana significant prejudice by depriving him of his \nliberty. \n44.  ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to issue detainers in accordance with \ndue process protections required by the relevant provisions of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(a)(2) and 8 U.S.C. § 1357(d)) caused Mr. Orellana significant pain and suffering by \ndepriving him of his liberty.  In particular, ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to obtain \njudicial warrants prior to detaining Mr. Orellana, and failure to demonstrate any particularized \nreason to believe that Mr. Orellana was likely to flee before such a  warrant could be obtained, \nviolates 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). \n45.  ICE’s application (under the supervision of DHS) of the immigration detainer \nregulations and issuance of detainers against Mr. Orellana exceeded ICE’s statutory authority in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n46.  As an actual and proximate result of ICE’s statutory violations, under the supervision \nof DHS, Mr. Orellana has suffered a significant deprivation of his liberty without due process of \nlaw and has been damaged as a result.   \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n(Against All Defendants) \n47.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 46 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n11 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 12 of 17 PageID #:\n105\n48.  Mr.  Orellana  challenges  Defendants’  deprivation  of  his  “rights,  privileges,  or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws” under color of state and local law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \n49.  Mr. Orellana has been held in violation of the Constitution of the United States.  Mr. \nOrellana was held solely on the basis of the ICE detainer issued in his name.  SCSO (under the \nsupervision of County) had no legal authority to continue to hold Mr. Orellana in custody after his \nbrother paid his bail. \n50.  Immigration detainers lack any standards guiding their issuance.  The detainer issued \nto SCSO (under the supervision of County) regarding Mr. Orellana was not issued by ICE (under \nthe supervision of DHS) according to any legal standard.  It was not issued based on evidence \ndemonstrating reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or any other ground.  Defendants’ continued \ndetention of Mr. Orellana thus deprived him of his liberty without probable cause. \n51.  SCSO’s continued detention of Mr. Orellana (under the supervision of County) \nviolated his Fourth Amendment constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure and Mr. \nOrellana has been damaged as a result. \nFourth Amendment Violation: Detention Without a Hearing  \n(Against All Defendants) \n52.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 51 above are repeated and alleged \nas through fully set forth herein. \n53.  Mr. Orellana has been held in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against \nunreasonable searches and seizures. \n54.  Immigration detainers issued by ICE (under the supervision of DHS) purport to \nrequire state and local law enforcement officials to hold individuals in custody, without any basis \n12 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 13 of 17 PageID #:\n106\nin state law and solely as a means of enforcing federal civil immigration statutes, for up to 48 hours.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 287.7. \n55.  Upon the payment of Mr. Orellana’s bail, SCSO’s legal basis to detain him ended.  \nDefendants’ continued detention of Mr. Orellana constituted the equivalent of a new arrest. \n56.  Because of this, and the fact that immigration detainers are not warrants issued upon \nprobable cause, these detainer procedures violate the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that an \nindividual arrested without a warrant be brought before a neutral magistrate for a probable cause \nhearing within 48 hours of arrest, irrespective of weekends or holidays. \n57.  Mr. Orellana was not brought before a neutral magistrate for a probable cause \nhearing.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have no process for bringing individuals subject \nto detainers before a neutral magistrate for a probable cause hearing within 48 hours.  Defendants’ \ndetention of Mr. Orellana therefore violated his Constitutional right to be free from unreasonable \nseizures and he has been damaged as a result. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution  \n(Against ICE, DHS, Kelly, Duke, Homan, Albence) \n58.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n59.  ICE’s issuance of detainers (under the supervision of DHS) based solely on a \ndetermination that there is reason to believe an individual is an alien subject to removal caused Mr. \nOrellana significant pain and suffering by depriving him of his liberty without due process of law. \n60.  ICE’s issuance of detainers (under the supervision of DHS) without requiring that \nsubjects of a detainer receive effective notice of the detainer caused Mr. Orellana to suffer \nsubstantial prejudice without affording him an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation. \n13 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 14 of 17 PageID #:\n107\n61.  ICE’s failure (under the supervision of DHS) to provide a proper mechanism by \nwhich subjects of a detainer may challenge the issuance of a detainer against them caused Mr. \nOrellana substantial prejudice by depriving him of his liberty without due process of law. \n62.  ICE’s  detainer  regulations,  policies,  practices,  acts,  and  omissions  (under  the \nsupervision of DHS) caused significant deprivation of Mr. Orellana’s liberty without due process \nof law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n63.  As  a  proximate  result  of  ICE’s  unconstitutional  detainer  regulations,  policies, \npractices, acts, and omissions, under the supervision of DHS, Mr. Orellana has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, a significant deprivation of his liberty without due process of law and he has \nbeen damaged as a result.   \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution  \n(Against SCSO, County, Bellone, and DeMarco) \n64.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 63 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n65.  Due process principles forbid the infringement of fundamental liberty interests, \nunless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. \n66.  The  continued  unauthorized  detention  of  an  individual  in  the  absence  of  any \nstandards guiding the issuance of the detainer is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernment interest.  As he was detained by SCSO (under the supervision of County) past the point \nof his judicially authorized release, Mr. Orellana’s fundamental liberty interests guaranteed by the \nFourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections were violated. \n14 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 15 of 17 PageID #:\n108\n67.  Due process further requires that the government be constrained before it acts in a \nway that deprives individuals of “liberty” interests protected under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n68.  Detainers issued by ICE purport to require state and local law enforcement officials \nto hold individuals in custody, without any basis in state law, standards guiding their issuance, or \nany judicial review, solely as a means of enforcing federal civil immigration statutes, for up to 48 \nhours, excluding weekends and government holidays.  See 8 C.F.R. § 287.7. \n69.  The Due Process Clause protects against the deprivation of liberty interests without \nthe due process of law and requires notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation \nas well as a method by which to challenge the deprivation.  Mr. Orellana was provided with none \nof these, in violation of his due process rights. \n70.  Mr. Orellana’s private liberty interest is overwhelming.  The risk that he has been \ndeprived of his liberty erroneously is high due to the fact that no court of law has adjudicated the \nlawfulness of SCSO’s continued detention (under the supervision of County) of individuals past \ntheir scheduled release date. \n71.  Interpreting  immigration  detainers  as  authorizing  Defendants’  continued \nunauthorized detention of Mr. Orellana without judicial review violates the procedural due process \nrights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and Mr. Orellana has been damaged as a result. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: \nViolations of the First Article of the New York Constitution  \n(Against SCSO, County, Bellone, and DeMarco) \n72.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 71 above are repeated and alleged \nas though fully set forth herein. \n15 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 1     Filed 07/18/17     Page 16 of 17 PageID #:\n109\n73.  By virtue of the acts described above, SCSO and County deprived Mr. Orellana of \nliberty  without  due  process  of  law  in  contravention  of  the  First  Article  of  the  New  York \nConstitution. \n74.  The acts and conduct of the servants, representatives, agents, and employees of \nSCSO and County were the direct and proximate cause of injury and damage to Mr. Orellana and \nviolated his statutory and common law rights as guaranteed by the laws and Constitution of the \nState of New York. \n75.  SCSO and County are liable for the above-mentioned actions of their agents, \nrepresentatives, servants, and/or employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior. \n76.  As a result of the foregoing, Mr. Orellana was severely and seriously injured, both \nbodily and mentally, suffered a loss of enjoyment of life, loss of liberty, experienced pain and \nsuffering, emotional distress, great humiliation, costs and expenses, economic loss and other \ndamages, and was otherwise damaged and injured. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Mr. Orellana prays that this Court grant the following relief: \n(1)  Enter  a  judgment  declaring  that  Defendants’  detention  of  Mr.  Orellana  was \nunauthorized by statute and contrary to law; \n(2)  Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n(3)  Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest at the maximum legal rate; \n(4)  Award reasonable costs and attorney’s fees; and \n(5)  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \nDated:   New York, New York \nJuly 18, 2017          WINSTON & STRAWN LLP \n              Counsel for Plaintiff \nBy:    /s/ Aldo A.

By  this  second  amended  complaint  (“Complaint”),  Plaintiffs-Petitioners \n(“Plaintiffs”) challenge the policy and practice of the SCSO and its officials of complying with \n“detainer” requests from the federal government agency Immigrations and Customs Enforcement \n(“ICE”).  By means of detainers, ICE requests that local law enforcement agencies such as SCSO \nretain individuals in custody for up to 48 hours after they would otherwise be released, to allow \nICE to take custody of those individuals at its leisure and place them into removal proceedings.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 2 of 21 PageID #: 630\nSCSO’s policy of unquestioning compliance with these requests deprived Plaintiffs of their \nfreedom, their families and their livelihoods, and violated their rights under the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and under the First Article of the New \nYork Constitution. \n2.  On or about April 23, 2017, Plaintiff Mr. Orellana was arrested by Suffolk County \npolice and remanded to the custody of the SCSO at the Yaphank jail.  ICE subsequently issued a \ndetainer requesting that SCSO maintain custody over Mr. Orellana for up to an additional 48 hours \nbeyond his scheduled release date.  Bail was set the following day, and his family paid it, but he \nwas not released.  Instead, SCSO unlawfully extended his detention until April 27, 2017 in order \nto transfer custody of his person to ICE.   \n3.  Similarly, on July 2, 2017, Plaintiff Mr. Hernandez was arrested by the Suffolk \nCounty Police and remanded to the custody of the SCSO.  ICE subsequently issued a detainer \nrequesting that SCSO maintain custody over Mr. Hernandez for up to an additional 48 hours \nbeyond his scheduled release date.  Upon disposition of Mr. Hernandez’s criminal case, at which \ntime he should have been released, he was instead remanded back to the custody of SCSO on \nAugust 18, 2017.  Immediately following that remand, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended \nComplaint in this action.  The same evening, a few hours after the filing of the First Amended \nComplaint, ICE took custody of Mr. Hernandez. \n4.  Mr. Hernandez was released on bond from ICE’s custody on or about January 23, \n2018.  Six weeks later, on or about March 9, 2018, Mr. Hernandez was once again arrested by \nSuffolk County police and remanded to the custody of the SCSO.  Once again, ICE issued a \ndetainer requesting that SCSO maintain custody over Mr. Hernandez for an additional 48 hours \nbeyond his scheduled release date.  Upon disposition of Mr. Hernandez’s criminal case the \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 3 of 21 PageID #: 631\nfollowing day, at which time he should have been released, he was instead remanded back to the \ncustody of SCSO.  That evening, ICE took custody of Mr. Hernandez.  Mr. Hernandez remains in \nICE’s custody as of the filing of this Second Amended Complaint. \n5.  On information and belief, SCSO has no procedures in place to ensure that the \nsubjects of detainers receive adequate notice of the detainers’ terms.  Moreover, even though the \ndetainer form states that “the alien must be served with a copy of this form,” neither ICE nor SCSO \nprovided Mr. Orellana with a copy of his ICE detainer until several days after it was issued. When \nMr. Orellana did finally receive a copy of his detainer, it was written only in English, a language \nMr. Orellana does not speak.  Mr. Hernandez was never served with a copy of his first ICE detainer \n(for the 2017 arrest) at all. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek damages under the First Article of the New York Constitution for \nthe violation of their rights. \n7.  Plaintiff Mr. Hernandez also seeks on his behalf and on behalf of similarly situated \nindividuals who have immigration detainers lodged against them, declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(a), and under the Fourth and Tenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution for the ongoing violation of their rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.  This Court also \nhas supplemental jurisdiction over this action’s New York Constitution claim pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367 because those claims are so related to the claims arising under the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of \nthe United States Constitution. \n9.  This Court has authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 4 of 21 PageID #: 632\nand 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n10.  This Court has authority to grant injunctive relief in this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 702 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n11.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because \na substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred, and \ncontinue to occur, in this District. \nPARTIES \n12.  At the time this action was commenced, Plaintiff Joaquin Orellana Castaneda was \na 34-year-old resident of Suffolk County detained at the Bergen County Jail in Hackensack, New \nJersey under the authority of ICE.  As described above, he was detained by SCSO pursuant to a \ndetainer request even after paying his bail, and was transferred by SCSO to ICE custody several \ndays thereafter.   \n13.  At the time the First Amended Complaint in this action was filed, Plaintiff German \nHernandez Argueta was a 22-year-old resident of Suffolk County, detained by the SCSO.  As \ndescribed above, he has twice been detained by SCSO pursuant to detainer requests past the time \nthat he should otherwise have been released, and then taken into custody by ICE. \n14.  Defendant  County  of  Suffolk  (“County”)  is  a  duly  constituted  municipal \ncorporation of the State of New York.  Upon information and belief, the County has direct authority \nover Defendant SCSO.  The County and/or its employees, agents or representatives are involved \nin the violations of constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n15.  Defendant Steven Bellone (“Bellone”) is the County Executive of the County of \nSuffolk.  Defendant Bellone is, among other responsibilities, charged with the administration of \nthe County of Suffolk.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 5 of 21 PageID #: 633\n16.  Defendant  SCSO  is  an  entity,  agency,  department,  and/or  subdivision  of  the \nCounty.  The SCSO and/or its employees, agents or representatives are involved in the violations \nof constitutional and statutory rights alleged herein. \n17.  Defendant Errol Toulon, Jr. is the Sheriff of Suffolk County and presides over the \nSuffolk County Sheriff’s Office as its chief executive officer.  He has held this position since \nJanuary 12, 2018.1  Upon information and belief, Defendant Toulon has direct authority over the \nSCSO.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nPLAINTIFFS’ DETENTION \n18.  Seeking to escape crime and violence in his native country, Mr. Orellana made his \nway to the United States in 2005, and settled in Suffolk County, New York.  He worked at a nursery \nthat sells plants wholesale to retail stores, and lived modestly so as to send as much of his earnings \nas possible to family members back home. \n19.  Mr. Orellana was arrested in the early morning hours of April 23, 2017 in Central \nIslip, New York, for violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. That same day, Mr. Orellana was \nbrought before a Suffolk County judge, who set Mr. Orellana’s bail at $1000 and remanded him \nto the custody of the SCSO.  Mr. Orellana spent the remainder of the day and night at Yaphank \nCorrectional Facility (“Yaphank”) in Yaphank, New York.   \n20.  The next day, April 24, 2017, Mr. Orellana was interviewed by ICE agents while \nunder SCSO custody at Yaphank.  Mr. Orellana was told that if he paid his bail, then he would be \nreleased and would eventually have to appear at an immigration hearing.  That same day, Mr. \n                                                 \n1 Prior to January 12, 2018, the office of Sheriff of Suffolk County was held by Vincent DeMarco.  \nPlaintiffs accordingly named Mr. DeMarco as a defendant when they commenced this action.  \nPlaintiffs now substitute Mr. Toulon for Mr. DeMarco pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 6 of 21 PageID #: 634\nOrellana’s cousin paid Mr. Orellana’s bail.  A true and correct copy of the bail receipt is attached \nhereto as Exhibit A. \n21.  However, no one informed Mr. Orellana that his bail had been paid, and SCSO \ncontinued to hold Mr. Orellana at Yaphank pursuant to an ICE detainer after his bail had been \npaid. SCSO did not serve Mr. Orellana with a copy of the detainer at that time. A true and correct \ncopy of Mr. Orellana’s detainer and accompanying I-200 administrative warrant is attached hereto \nas Exhibit B.  Though it is dated April 24, 2017, the certificate of service at the bottom is blank.   \n22.  On April 25, 2016, while Mr. Orellana remained at Yaphank, a member of SCSO \ntold him that there was a change in his paperwork, and gave no further explanation.  The next day, \nApril 26, 2017, Mr. Orellana was transferred from Yaphank to the Riverhead Correctional Facility \n(“Riverhead”) in Riverhead, New York.   \n23.  Upon information and belief, on or about April 27, 2017 (and certainly well after \nMr. Orellana should have been released from custody due to the payment of his bail), Mr. Orellana \nwas transferred into ICE’s custody, and taken from Riverhead to ICE’s Varick Street Detention \nCenter (“Varick Street”) in New York, New York. There, Mr. Orellana was questioned by ICE \nagents and given forms to sign.  Those forms included another copy of the I-200 warrant that had \naccompanied his detainer, but this time the I-200 was dated (by the ICE officer, not by Mr. \nOrellana) April 26, 2017. A true and correct copy of this second I-200 is attached hereto as Exhibit \nC.  Later that night, Mr. Orellana was transferred from Varick Street to the Bergen County Jail.  In \nthe fall of 2017, Mr. Orellana accepted a voluntary departure to Guatemala. \n24.  Like Mr. Orellana, Mr. Hernandez also fled his home due to gang threats and \nviolence.  He left his mother and sisters in 2014 at the age of 19, and came to live with his aunt \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 7 of 21 PageID #: 635\nand her family in Suffolk County.  Mr. Hernandez works in landscaping and snow removal, and \nsends money to his mother and sisters to help support them.  \n25.  On or about June 1, 2017, Suffolk County police approached Mr. Hernandez at a \n7-11 and asked his name without any objective credible reason, founded suspicion, or legal basis \nto do so. Frightened and taken aback by the arbitrary questioning, he stammered out a friend’s \nname instead of his own.  The police officers searched Mr. Hernandez’s pockets.  They discovered \na money transfer receipt (from sending money to his mother earlier that day), and saw that the \nname on the receipt was different from the name Mr. Hernandez had told them.  Mr. Hernandez \nadmitted that he had been scared and that the name on the receipt was his real name.  The officers \narrested him for false personation and took him to the precinct for the day.  He was taken to court \nthe following day and arraigned, released on his own recognizance, and given a date to return to \ncourt. \n26.  Mr. Hernandez inadvertently lost the paper with his court date and could not \nremember when he was to return.  Then, on July 2, 2017, Suffolk County police (who had a photo \nof Mr. Hernandez in their hands) questioned him at a gas station where he was sitting with a friend, \nand asked his name.  Mr. Hernandez was afraid that he was in trouble for missing his court date, \nand again gave a friend’s name.  The police arrested him again for false personation and took him \nto the local precinct.  He was eventually arraigned before a Suffolk County judge, who set bail at \n$500 and remanded him to the custody of the SCSO. \n27.  On July 3, 2017, Mr. Hernandez was transferred to Yaphank.  While in the custody \nof the SCSO, he was questioned by ICE agents stationed at the jail about his immigration status, \nand given English forms to sign.  Mr. Hernandez refused to sign the forms, and was not provided \nwith copies. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 8 of 21 PageID #: 636\n28.  A few days later, on July 7, 2017, ICE issued a detainer and accompanying I-200 \nadministrative warrant for Mr. Hernandez, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits D and \nE, respectively.  Neither ICE nor SCSO served Mr. Hernandez with copies of the documents at \nthat time, as is evident on the face of the documents themselves.  The certificate of service on the \ndetainer is left blank.  The certificate of service on the I-200 administrative warrant is dated August \n19, 2017—six weeks after it was issued, and a day after Mr. Hernandez was taken into ICE \ncustody, as described below. \n29.  On August 18, 2017, Mr. Hernandez pled guilty to disorderly conduct, a violation, \nand was sentenced to time already served. However, instead of releasing Mr. Hernandez, SCSO \nretained him in custody pursuant to the detainer request issued by ICE.  During this time, Plaintiffs \nfiled the First Amended Complaint in this action.  Later in the evening of August 18, ICE took \ncustody of Mr. Hernandez. \n30.  On or about January 23, 2018, Mr. Hernandez was released on bond from ICE’s \ncustody.  Six weeks later, on or about March 9, 2018, Mr. Hernandez was biking home from work \nat the supermarket when he was approached by Suffolk County police.  They asked his name, and \nhe gave his real name:  Enrique Hernandez.  (Mr. Hernandez prefers to be called by his middle \nname, Enrique, rather than his first name, Germán.)  But he had no identification on his person, \nand so he agreed to take the police officers to his home.  There, he showed them various documents \nwith his name on them.  The police officers, however, misunderstood him to have given his name \nas “Eric” rather than “Enrique,” and so arrested him once again for false personation.  The police \nalso added a charge for criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree by a non-U.S. citizen, \nbecause Mr. Hernandez had had a box cutter on his person from his supermarket job, which he \nused for cutting open boxes of produce. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 9 of 21 PageID #: 637\n31.  Mr. Hernandez was arraigned the next day, March 10, 2018, and remanded to the \ncustody of the SCSO at Yaphank jail.  That same day, ICE issued a new detainer request to SCSO, \nalong with a new I-200 administrative warrant.  This time, an ICE agent served Mr. Hernandez \nwith copies of the documents.   \n32.  On March 30, 2018, the district attorney offered a plea of one day’s adjournment \nin contemplation of dismissal, which Mr. Hernandez accepted.  Mr. Hernandez was taken back to \nYaphank, where he signed a release form, but was not released.  Instead, later that evening he was \ntaken to Riverhead, where he remained all through the weekend.  On Monday morning, he was \ntaken to ICE’s Varick Street jail, questioned again by ICE agents, and then taken to the Hudson \nCounty jail in Kearney, New Jersey, where he remains under ICE’s custody to date.  \nTHE DETAINER SYSTEM \n33.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a), the Department of Homeland Security, through its \ndivision of ICE, purports to have the authority to issue detainers in accordance with the intent and \nrequirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”). \n34.  As of June 13, 2017 ICE has increased the issuance of detainers 75 percent \ncompared with the same time period in 2016.  Relatedly, a Washington Post article reports that \nICE has deputized over 40 local law enforcement agencies to help ICE enforce immigration law, \nand that besides conducting its own searches, ICE uses a fingerprint-sharing program to learn when \nan undocumented immigrant has been arrested by state or local authorities. \n35.  SCSO has stated that its policy—unlike that of many other law enforcement \nagencies—is to comply with detainer requests by holding the individuals in question for up to 48 \nhours past the time when they would otherwise be released to allow ICE to decide whether to take \ncustody of a detainee and then take custody of those it chooses.  \n36.  The process works as follows:  When ICE learns that SCSO has taken custody of a \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 10 of 21 PageID #: 638\nperson whom ICE believes to be subject to removal from the United States, it lodges a detainer \nwith SCSO.  The detainer is a form that asks SCSO to: \nMaintain custody of the alien for a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS \nbeyond the time when he/she would otherwise have been released from your \ncustody to allow DHS to assume custody. The alien must be served with a copy \nof this form for the detainer to take effect.  \n \n37.   The detainer also informs SCSO that “DHS has determines that probable cause \nexists that the subject is a removable alien.”  And it checks off one or more of four boxes to \nindicate the basis for this statement.  The four options are: \n“1.  A final order of removal against the alien; \n \n2.       The pendency of ongoing removal proceedings against the alien; \n \n3.  Biometric confirmation of the alien’s identity and a records check of federal \ndatabases that affirmatively indicate, by themselves or in addition to other reliable \ninformation, that the alien either lacks immigration status or notwithstanding such \nstatus is removable under U.S. immigration law; and/or \n \n4.  Statements made by the alien to an immigration officer and/or other reliable \nevidence that affirmatively indicate the alien either lacks immigration status or \nnotwithstanding such status is removable under U.S. immigration law.” (emphases \nadded). \n \n37.  Notably, not a word in the detainer refers to any probable cause that a crime has \nbeen committed by the individual in question.  Being a “removable alien” is a civil, not criminal, \nviolation of the INA.  And SCSO does not have the authority to arrest or detain individuals for \ncivil violations of the INA. \n38.  Further, the language of check boxes three and four provides little guidance as to \nthe actual basis for ICE’s determination.   For instance, by checking box four, ICE purportedly \nindicates its belief that the individual is removable on the basis of statements (what statements?) \nmade to an immigration officer, or “other reliable evidence” (what evidence?), or both, indicating \na lack of immigration status, or the existence of status but also of another basis for removal (what \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 11 of 21 PageID #: 639\nbasis?).  These vague check-box statements riddled with disjunctives do not adequately place \nSCSO or the recipients of detainers on notice of the basis for their detention.  \n39.  Detainers  are  also  sometimes  accompanied  by  an  I-200  administrative  arrest \nwarrant.  Like the detainer, the administrative arrest warrant says nothing whatsoever about any \ncrime having been committed.  Instead, an ICE officer simply states “I have determined that there \nis probable cause to believe that [name of individual] is removable from the United States.”  \nDetainers are not accompanied by judicial arrest warrants at all—whether for removal or for \ncriminal detention. \n40.  Both the detainer and the administrative warrant are supposed to be served upon \nthe affected individual.  Frequently, though, this does not happen, or does not happen in a timely \nmanner.  This was the case for both Plaintiffs here, as set forth above.  \n41.  Even if the subject of a detainer is timely served with the appropriate copies, there \nis little that he or she can do to challenge the detention.  Neither ICE nor SCSO provides an \nadministrative procedure for challenging the issuance of a detainer.  Likewise, the Board of \nImmigration Appeals (BIA) has ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to consider challenges to \ndetainers because it has found that individuals held on detainers are not in federal immigration \ncustody.  Thus, recipients of detainers are effectively left without a viable remedy to challenge \ntheir unlawful detention. \n42.  The detainers contain a paragraph entitled “notice to the detainee,” which reads as \nfollows: \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has placed an immigration detainer \non you. An immigration detainer is a notice to a law enforcement agency that DHS \nintends to assume custody of you (after you otherwise would be released from \ncustody) because there is probable cause that you are subject to removal from the \nUnited States under federal immigration law. DHS has requested that the law \nenforcement agency that is currently detaining you maintain custody of you for a \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 12 of 21 PageID #: 640\nperiod not to exceed 48 hours beyond the time when you would have been released \nbased on your criminal charges or convictions. If DHS does not take you into \ncustody during this additional 48 hour period, you should contact your \ncustodian (the agency that is holding you now) to inquire about your release. If \nyou believe you are a United States citizen or the victim of a crime, please \nadvise DHS by calling the ICE Law Enforcement Support Center toll free at \n(855) 448-6903. \n \n43.  This notice, even if Plaintiffs had timely received it, does not constitute adequate \ndue process.  Among other things, the inclusion of a hotline number on a notice for certain specific \nproblems, even if Plaintiffs had been able to call it, did not afford them an adequate opportunity to \nchallenge their detention.  And while the form contains translations of this “notice to the detainee” \nparagraph into Spanish and several other languages, the copy of his detainer that Mr. Orellana \nultimately received omitted the notice page altogether.   \n44.  Prior to October 2017 (at which time ICE entered into an Intergovernmental \nAgreement (“IGA”) with SCSO, as described further below), once a detainer was lodged against \nan individual, and once that individual’s criminal custody came to an end, SCSO would simply \ncontinue to hold the individual in the same manner as he or she had previously been detained \npursuant to his or her criminal case.  ICE would then come to the jail at its convenience, take \ncustody of the individual and transfer him or her to one of its own detention centers. \n45.  The IGA added a bit more variability to this process, in that it now permits ICE to \nkeep its detainees in the Riverhead jail.  In other words, the Riverhead jail now houses inmates \nwho are in the custody of SCSO on criminal matters (as it always has), and those who are \nconsidered (under the IGA) to be in the custody of ICE for removal proceedings.   \n46.  In a declaration dated December 5, 2017, Francis Kemp, Assistant Field Office \nDirector in ICE’s Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (“ERO”), explained that there \nare now “four possible scenarios as to how an alien may be transferred from Suffolk County to \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 13 of 21 PageID #: 641\nICE custody from either Riverhead or Yaphank.”  Two of these scenarios are identical to the \nprevious process, in which ICE simply comes to either Yaphank or Riverhead, takes physical \ncustody of the individual and transfers him or her directly to one of its more permanent detention \nfacilities elsewhere.  ICE now also has the option of asking SCSO to transfer the individual from \nYaphank to ICE’s custody at the Riverhead jail, or of simply transferring an individual already in \nthe Riverhead jail from SCSO’s custody to ICE’s custody within the Riverhead jail itself.   \n47.  From the constitutional point of view, there is not a shred of difference between \nany of the “four possible scenarios.”  In all four scenarios, SCSO is maintaining custody over an \nindividual past the time when he or she should otherwise have been released, based only on ICE’s \nsay-so that there is probable cause of removability—not that a crime has been committed.  Nor can \nthe SCSO wash its hands of liability by asserting that some of the individuals it is holding are \nconstructively in ICE custody; the mere act of transferring an individual from one location to \nanother after that individual should have been released is a violation of law. \n48.  In short, irrespective of whether or not ICE has the authority to hold individuals at \nRiverhead or other local detention facilities pursuant to an IGA (an issue which may be contested \nbut is not the subject of this lawsuit), there is simply no basis for  SCSO’s practice of maintaining \ncustody over individuals between the time their criminal case ends and the time ICE assumes \ncustody over them.  Whether ICE, after taking custody over the individual, houses him or her at \nRiverhead under the IGA, or at another ICE facility, makes no difference at all to the lawfulness \nof SCSO’s conduct.  \n49.  The SCSO is well aware that numerous state and federal courts have found law \nenforcement agencies liable for Fourth Amendment violations where they have held individuals \npursuant to detainers.  Indeed, in or about 2014, Suffolk County’s own attorney advised local \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 14 of 21 PageID #: 642\nauthorities against the honoring of detainers unless accompanied by a judicial warrant.  \n50.  In or about February 2017, the New York State Sheriffs’ Association (of which \nSCSO is a member) commissioned a comprehensive review of the relevant case law in light of the \nissuance by ICE of its new detainer form.  The Association’s report concluded that “[s]heriffs \nshould not detain persons beyond their normal release date based on a federal detainer warrant, \neven if accompanied by an order of deportation or removal, unless there is also a judicial \nwarrant.” (emphasis added).  A true and correct copy of the Sheriffs’ Association Report and \nanalysis is attached hereto as Exhibit F. \n51.  The SCSO, undeterred, has continued to comply with detainers, and, as in the case \nof Plaintiffs, to detain individuals even beyond the time requested under the detainer.  The SCSO \nappears similarly untroubled by the New York State Attorney General’s earlier conclusion (which \npost-dates the introduction of the new detainer forms) that “[a]bsent a judicial warrant, [local law \nenforcement agencies] should honor ICE or [Customs and Border Protection] detainer requests \nonly  in  limited,  specific  circumstances,”  meaning  “a  showing  of  probable  cause  that  the \nindividual committed a crime or that an exception to the probable cause requirement applies.” \n(emphasis added) A true and correct copy of the New York State Attorney General’s report is \nattached hereto as Exhibit G. \n52.  In short, the SCSO knows, or has reason to know, that complying with detainers is \nunlawful.  Thus, its continued honoring of ICE detainers is a willful violation of Plaintiffs’ \nstatutory and constitutional rights. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n53.  Pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(1),  (b)(2)  and/or  (c)(4),  Plaintiffs,  seek  to \nrepresent a class (the “Class”) consisting of: \nAll persons who were, are, or will be detained by SCSO on the basis of an ICE \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 15 of 21 PageID #: 643\ndetainer in which ICE requested SCSO to continue to detain the individual after \nSCSO’s detention authority has otherwise expired. \n54.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5), Plaintiff Mr. Hernandez seeks to represent a \nsub-class (the “Sub-Class”) consisting of: \nAll persons who are or will be detained by SCSO and against whom ICE has an \nactive immigration detainer in which ICE requested SCSO to continue to detain \nthe individual after SCSO’s detention authority has otherwise expired. \n55.  The  Class  seeks  declaratory  relief—and  the  Sub-Class  seeks  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief—that prohibits the detention of any individual by local law enforcement agencies \non the basis of an ICE detainer and otherwise eliminates or remedies Defendants’ application of \nimmigration detainer policies, practices, acts, and omissions that are depriving Plaintiffs of their \nliberty in violation of their rights.  The Class also seeks monetary damages to compensate Plaintiffs \nfor this unlawful detention.   \n56.  The proposed Class and Sub-Class are very numerous.  In FY2009, at least 223,297 \nindividuals detained by ICE (approximately 60% of ICE’s FY2009 detention population) were \nfirst stopped, arrested, or criminally convicted by local law enforcement agencies.  See Dora \nSchriro, ICE, Immigration Detention Overview and Recommendations at 11-12 (Oct. 6, 2009).  \nAccording  to  testimony  given  by  ICE  Deputy  Director  Thomas  Homan  before  the  House \nCommittee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, ICE has issued 78,176 \ndetainers in the current fiscal year—a figure up 75 percent compared with the same time period in \n2016. \n57.  Joinder  of  all  Class  and  Sub-Class  members  is  impracticable.    Because  ICE \ncontinuously lodges detainers against individuals and assumes physical custody of those held on \ndetainers, the membership of the Class and Sub-Class changes constantly. \n58.  All individuals who would fall within the Class and Sub-Class Definitions have had \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 16 of 21 PageID #: 644\nSCSO’s ICE detainer policies, practices, acts, and omissions applied against them, causing \nunlawful deprivation of liberty in violation of their rights.  There are questions of law or fact \ncommon to all Class and Sub-Class members, including, but not limited to: \n  Whether SCSO’s detention of a Class or Sub-Class member based only on a \ndetainer as described above violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution and/or the First Article of the New York Constitution; \n  Whether SCSO’s detention of a Class or Sub-Class member pursuant to a detainer \nwithout providing or requiring notice to the Class or Sub-Class member violates \nthe Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and/or the First \nArticle of the New York Constitution; and \n  Whether SCSO’s detention of a Class or Sub-Class member pursuant to a detainer \nwithout  providing  the  Class  or  Sub-Class  member  an  adequate  means  of \nchallenging detainers violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution and/or the First Article of the New York Constitution. \n59.  Given  the  commonality  of  the  questions  shared  by  all  Class  and  Sub-Class \nmembers, prosecuting separate claims as to individual Class and Sub-Class members would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants and the adjudications as to individual \nClass and Sub-Class members’ claims might be dispositive of the interests of other Class and Sub-\nClass members, thus substantially impairing their ability to protect their interests. \n60.  Defendants have acted and intend to act in a manner adverse to the rights of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class, making final declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the Class \nas a whole, and making final declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the Sub-\nClass. \n61.  Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in class action, civil rights, and immigrants’ \nrights litigation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the Class \nand Sub-Class. \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 17 of 21 PageID #: 645\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolations of the First Article of the New York Constitution  \n62.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 61 above are repeated and \nalleged as though fully set forth herein. \n63.  By virtue of the acts described above, SCSO and County deprived Plaintiffs and \nother members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class of liberty without due process of law in \ncontravention of the First Article of the New York Constitution. \n64.  The acts and conduct of the servants, representatives, agents, and employees of \nSCSO and County were the direct and proximate cause of injury and damage to Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class and violated their statutory and common law rights \nas guaranteed by the laws and Constitution of the State of New York. \n65.  SCSO and County are liable for the above-mentioned actions of their agents, \nrepresentatives, servants, and/or employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior. \n66.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class \nand Sub-Class were severely and seriously injured, both bodily and mentally, suffered a loss of \nenjoyment of life, loss of liberty, experienced pain and suffering, emotional distress, great \nhumiliation, costs and expenses, economic loss and other damages, and were otherwise damaged \nand injured. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution  \n67.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 66 above are repeated and \nalleged as though fully set forth herein. \n68.  Due process principles forbid the infringement of fundamental liberty interests, \nunless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 18 of 21 PageID #: 646\n69.  The continued unauthorized detention of an individual based only on vague and \nambiguous assertions by ICE that there is probable cause of removability is not narrowly tailored \nto serve a compelling government interest.  As Plaintiffs were detained by SCSO (under the \nsupervision of County) past the point of their judicially authorized release, their fundamental \nliberty interests and those of other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class guaranteed by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections were violated. \n70.  Due process further requires that the government be constrained before it acts in a \nway that deprives individuals of “liberty” interests protected under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  The Due Process Clause protects against the deprivation of liberty \ninterests without the due process of law and requires notice and an opportunity to be heard prior \nto the deprivation as well as a method by which to challenge the deprivation.  Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class were provided with none of these, in violation of \ntheir due process rights. \n71.  The private liberty interests of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class \nand  Sub-Class  are  overwhelming.    The  risk  that  they  have  been  deprived  of  their  liberty \nerroneously is high due to the fact that no court of law has adjudicated the lawfulness of SCSO’s \ncontinued detention (under the supervision of County) of individuals past their scheduled release \ndate. \n72.  Interpreting  immigration  detainers  as  authorizing  Defendants’  continued \nunauthorized detention of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class \nwithout judicial review violates the procedural due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment and Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class have been \ndamaged as a result. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 19 of 21 PageID #: 647\n73.  The relief sought by Mr. Hernandez and other members of the proposed Sub-Class \nis necessary to prevent continued and future injury. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n74.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 73 above are repeated and \nalleged as though fully set forth herein. \n75.  Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class are held, or have \nbeen held, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.  Plaintiffs, and other members of \nthe proposed Class and Sub-Class were and are held solely on the basis of the ICE detainers issued \nin their names.  SCSO (under the supervision of County) had no legal authority to continue to hold \nPlaintiffs, and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class in custody after their judicially \nauthorized release.   \n76.  SCSO’s continued detention of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class \nand Sub-Class (under the supervision of County) violated and continues to violate their Fourth \nAmendment constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure and Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class have been damaged as a result. \n77.  Upon the judicially authorized release of Plaintiffs and other members of the \nproposed Class and Sub-Class, Defendants’ legal authority to maintain custody of Plaintiffs and \nother members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class ended or will end.  Defendants’ continued \ndetention of Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class constitutes the \nequivalent of a new arrest. \n78.  Because of this, and the fact that immigration detainers are not warrants issued upon \nprobable cause that a crime has been committed, these detainer procedures violate the Fourth \nAmendment’s requirement that an individual arrested without a warrant be brought before a neutral \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-RRM-ARL   Document 37   Filed 05/29/18   Page 20 of 21 PageID #: 648\nmagistrate for a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest, irrespective of weekends or \nholidays. \n79.  Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class were not brought \nbefore a neutral magistrate for a criminal probable cause hearing.  Upon information and belief, \nDefendants  have  no  process  for  bringing  individuals  subject  to  detainers  before  a  neutral \nmagistrate for a criminal probable cause hearing within 48 hours.  Defendants’ detention of \nPlaintiffs  and  other  members  of  the  proposed  Class  and  Sub-Class  therefore  violated  their \nConstitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures and they have been damaged as a result. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed Class and Sub-Class pray \nthat this Court grant the following relief: \n(1)  Issue an injunction ordering Defendants not to detain any individual solely on the \nbasis of an immigration detainer; \n(2)  Enter a judgment declaring that Defendants’ detention of Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the proposed Class and Sub-Class was unauthorized by statute and contrary to law; \n(3)  Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n(4)  Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest at the maximum legal rate; \n(5)  Award reasonable costs and attorney’s fees; and \n(6)  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n \nDated:   New York, New York \nMay 29, 2018       WINSTON & STRAWN LLP \n              Counsel for Plaintiffs \nBy:    /s/ Aldo A.

KUNTZ, II, United States District Judge:    \nNamed Plaintiffs Joaquin Orellana Castaneda (“Plaintiff Orellana”) and German Hernandez \nArgueta (“Plaintiff Hernandez”), bring this class action against the County of Suffolk, the \nSuffolk County Sherriff’s Office, County Executive Steven Bellone in his official capacity, and \nSuffolk County Sheriff Errol Toulon, Jr. in his official capacity (collectively, “Defendants”), \nalleging violations of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution and under the First Article of the New York State Constitution.  \nBefore the Court are the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment.  For the reasons stated \nherein, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED and Defendants’ motion is GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part.    \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), codified as amended at 8 \nU.S.C. 1101 et seq., the Attorney General of the United States “can exercise discretion to issue a \nwarrant for an alien’s arrest and detention ‘pending a decision on whether the alien is to be \nremoved from the United States.’”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 407 (2012) (quoting \n8. U.S.C. § 1226(a)).  While the INA gives federal officers significant discretion to apprehend \nindividuals believed to be removable aliens, “federal law specifies limited circumstances in \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 2 of 34 PageID #:\n4572\nwhich state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.”  Id. at 408.  Section \n287(g) of the INA, codified at 8 U.S.C. 1357(g), empowers the Attorney General to authorize \ncertain state or local officers to “perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the \ninvestigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States” in instances where the \nAttorney General has entered into a written agreement with the relevant state or local entity.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  State or local officers covered by these 287(g) agreements “are subject to \nthe Attorney General’s direction and supervision.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 409.  Section 287(g) \nalso permits local law enforcement “to cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, \napprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States” absent an \nagreement.  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10)(B).  As the Supreme Court has remarked, “[t]here may be \nsome ambiguity as to what constitutes cooperation under the federal law; but no coherent \nunderstanding of the term would incorporate the unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an \nalien for being removable absent any request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal \nGovernment.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 410. \nThe federal regulation governing immigration detainers, promulgated pursuant to the \nINA, details what the delegation process to local law enforcement entails:   \nAny  authorized  immigration  officer  may  at  any  time  issue  a  Form  I–247, \nImmigration Detainer–Notice of Action, to any other Federal, State, or local law \nenforcement agency.  A detainer serves to advise another law enforcement agency \nthat the Department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that \nagency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien.  The detainer is a \nrequest that such agency advise the Department, prior to release of the alien, in \norder for the Department to arrange to assume custody, in situations when gaining \nimmediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible. . . . Upon a \ndetermination by the Department to issue a detainer for an alien not otherwise \ndetained by a criminal justice agency, such agency shall maintain custody of the \nalien for a period not to exceed 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and \nholidays in order to permit assumption of custody by the Department. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 3 of 34 PageID #:\n4573\n8 C.F.R. § 287.7.  As the language suggests, a detainer is merely a request.  Just as state \nand local agencies have the choice to enter into a 287(g) agreement, the regulation governing \ndetainers does not impose mandatory obligations on state and local law enforcement agencies to \nhonor detainer requests issued by federal officers.  See Galarza v. Szalczyk, 745 F.3d 634, 639-\n43 (3d Cir. 2014). \nII.  BACKGROUND \n  Plaintiffs Orellana and Hernandez brought this suit against Defendants on behalf of a \nclass of all persons who, from July 18, 2014 through November 15, 2018, were detained by the \nSuffolk County Sheriff’s Office (“SCSO”) pursuant to an ICE immigration detainer request after \nthe SCSO’s detention authority had expired, alleging violations of their rights under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and under the First Article of the \nNew York State Constitution.  Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), ECF No. 37; Report and \nRecommendation (“R&R”), ECF No. 129, Order Adopting R&R, ECF No. 143.  On July 1, \n2024, following oral argument, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for class certification and \ndirected the parties to refile their cross-motions for summary judgment.  See Order Adopting \nR&R.  Plaintiffs’ renewed motion, which was fully briefed on October 23, 2024, argues \nPlaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment as to liability on their state law and Fourth \nAmendment claims.  See Pls’. Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (“Pls. Mem.”), ECF No. 150-1; Defs.’ \nMem. Opp’n Summ. J. (“Defs. Opp’n”), ECF No. 152; Pls.’ Reply Supp. Summ. J., ECF No. \n150-30.  Defendants’ renewed motion, which was fully briefed on December 6, 2024, argues \nDefendants are entitled to summary judgment on all Plaintiffs’ claims.  See Defs.’ Mem. Supp. \nSumm. J. (“Defs. Mem.”), ECF No. 160-39; Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n Summ. J. (“Pls. Opp’n”), ECF \nNo. 161, Defs.’ Reply Supp. Summ. J. (“Defs.’ Reply”) ECF No. 160-41.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 4 of 34 PageID #:\n4574\nA.  Factual Background \n  Unless otherwise stated, the following facts are undisputed and drawn from the parties’ \nLocal Rule 56.1 Statements, declarations, deposition testimony, and other evidence submitted in \nsupport of the motion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  See generally Pls.’ Local Rule 56.1(a) Stmt. of \nUndisputed Material Facts (“Pls.’ Stmt.”), ECF No. 150-2; Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Local Rule \n56.1(a) Stmt. (“Defs.’ Resp. Stmt.”), ECF No. 152-1; Pls.’ Reply to Defs.’ Resp. Stmt. (“Pls.’ \nReply Stmt.”); ECF No. 150-31; Defs.’ Local Rule 56.1(a) Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts \n(“Defs.’ Stmt.”), ECF No. 160-38; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Local Rule 56.1(a) Stmt. (“Pls.’ Resp. \nStmt.”), ECF No. 161-1; Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Resp. Stmt. (“Defs.’ Reply Stmt.”); ECF No. 160-\n40; see also Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Original Local Rule 56.1 Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts \n(“Defs.’ Original Resp. Stmt.”), ECF No. 34.1   \nDefendant County of Suffolk is a municipal corporation of the State of New York that \nhas direct authority over Defendant Suffolk County Sherriff’s Office (“SCSO”), an entity, \nagency, and/or subdivision of the County.  Pls.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 4-5, 8.  Defendant Steven Bellone \nserved as the County Executive of the County of Suffolk during the relevant period.  Id.  ¶ 6.  \nDefendant Errol Toulon, Jr., who is the Suffolk County Sheriff, has direct authority over the \nSCSO.  Id. ¶ 9. \nFederal regulation 8 C.F.R. § 287.7, which was promulgated pursuant to Section \n103(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, permits the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”), through its division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), to issue \n \n1 On October 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike certain of Defendants’ responses to Plaintiffs’ renewed \nlocal 56.1 statements, arguing those responses differed from their responses to Plaintiffs’ original motion, despite \nthe facts remaining the same.  See ECF No. 151-1.  On December 19, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion.  \nECF No. 165.  As a result, the Court relies on Defendants’ original responses, ECF No. 34, where the renewed \nresponses are inconsistent.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 5 of 34 PageID #:\n4575\nimmigration detainer requests to local law enforcement agencies.  Ex. H. to Badini Decl., ECF \nNo. 150-11.  These detainer requests (Form I-247D or Form I-247X), which are generally \naccompanied by a DHS administrative warrant for the arrest of an alien (Form I-200) or for \nremoval/deportation (Form I-205), which are both civil in nature, communicate to local law \nenforcement that ICE has reason to believe an individual currently in the custody of local law \nenforcement is subject to removal from the United States.  Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 41; Ex. H to Badini \nDecl.; Ex. J. to Badini Decl. at 113:7-13, ECF No. 150-13.  These detainer requests ask local law \nenforcement to detain the subject individual for up to 48 hours after he or she would otherwise \nbe subject to release to allow ICE to assume custody.  Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 41; Ex. H. to Badini Decl.  \nA detainer request requires the local law enforcement agency to serve the detainer request on the \nsubject individual.  Ex. I to Badini Decl. at COS 00000003, ECF No. 150-1 (“The alien must be \nserved with a copy of this form for the detainer to take effect.”); see also Ex. J. to Badini Dec. at \n149-50.   \nIt is undisputed that, between December 2, 2016 and November 15, 2018, the SCSO had \nan official policy of honoring ICE detainer requests and corresponding warrants.  Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ \n19.  On November 15, 2018, Defendant Sheriff Toulon, Jr. issued a memorandum to SCSO \npersonnel explaining that the SCSO’s policy, as of that date, was not to hold individuals on the \nbasis of ICE detainer requests.  Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ 27; Def. Resp. ¶ 23.  While the SCSO continued to \naccept detainer requests and alert ICE of suspected undocumented individuals through at least \nOctober 2021, Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ 28; Defs.’ Original Resp. Stmt. ¶ 24., no individuals were detained \npast November 15, 2018, Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 43.    \nOn April 23, 2017, Plaintiff Orellana was arrested by the Suffolk County Policy \nDepartment (“SCPD”) for traffic violations and remanded to the custody of the SCSO.  Defs.’ \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 6 of 34 PageID #:\n4576\nStmt. ¶¶ 4, 6.  On April 24, 2017, ICE issued a detainer request and accompanying I-200 \nadministrative warrant for Plaintiff Orellana.  Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 9.  The certificate of service on \nPlaintiff Orellana’s detainer request, which was to be filled out by the SCSO after Plaintiff \nOrellana was served, was left blank.  Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ 32.  Also on April 24, 2017, Plaintiff \nOrellana’s bail was posted by his cousin.  Id. ¶33.  However, instead of being released, Plaintiff \nOrellana was detained by the SCSO pursuant to the ICE detainer and corresponding \nadministrative warrant.  Id. ¶¶ 34-35.  The SCSO sent a memorandum to ICE informing the \nagency that Plaintiff Orellana was being held “ON YOUR DETAINER ONLY AND NO \nLONGER HA[S] CHARGES IN SUFFOLK COUNTY.”  Ex. I to Badini Decl. at \nCOS00000009.  Plaintiff Orellana was held by the SCSO until April 26, 2017, at which time ICE \nassumed custody of him.  Pls.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 37-38. \nOn July 2, 2017, Plaintiff Hernandez was arrested by the SCPD on a charge of false \npersonation and subsequently remanded to the custody of the SCSO.  Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ 39-40.  On \nJuly 7, 2017, ICE issued a detainer and accompanying I-200 administrative warrant for Plaintiff \nHernandez.  Id. ¶ 41.  The certificate of service on Plaintiff Hernandez’s detainer request, which \nwas to be filled out by the SCSO after Plaintiff Hernandez was served, was left blank.  Id. ¶ 42.  \nOn August 18, 2017, Plaintiff Hernandez pled guilty to a disorderly conduct violation and was \nsentenced to time served.  Id. ¶ 43.  Despite receiving a sentence of time served, Plaintiff \nHernandez was detained by the SCSO until later that same evening, at which time he was \ntransferred to ICE custody.  Id. ¶ 44.  On January 23, 2018, Plaintiff Hernandez was released on \nbond from ICE custody.  Id. ¶ 45. \nOn March 9, 2018, Plaintiff Hernandez was again arrested by officers of the SCPD on \ncharges of false personation and criminal possession of a weapon.  Id. ¶ 46.  Plaintiff Hernandez \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 7 of 34 PageID #:\n4577\nwas taken into SCSO custody on March 10, 2018.  Id. ¶ 47.  Also on March 10, 2018, ICE issued \na detainer request for Plaintiff Hernandez.  Id. ¶ 48.  Again, the certificate of service was left \nblank.  Id. ¶ 49.  On March 30, 2018, Plaintiff Hernandez took a plea agreement of one day’s \nadjournment in contemplation of dismissal.  Id. ¶ 50.  That same day, the SCSO sent a \nmemorandum to ICE with language identical to that in the memorandum pertaining to Plaintiff \nOrellana, explaining Plaintiff Hernandez no longer had charges in Suffolk County and was \ninstead being held solely pursuant to the ICE detainer.  Id. ¶ 51.  Despite his plea, Plaintiff \nHernandez remained in the custody of the SCSO until April 2, 2018, at which time he was \ntransferred to ICE custody.  Id. ¶ 52.  \nAs previously noted, the certificates of service on the detainers were left blank for both \nPlaintiff Orellana and Plaintiff Hernandez.  Pls. Stmt. ¶¶ 32, 42, 49.  The SCSO did not serve the \nICE detainer requests on Plaintiffs.  Id. ¶ 17; Defs.’ Original Resp. Stmt. ¶ 14.  Further, the \nSCSO did not take any steps to notify Plaintiffs of the detainer requests lodged against them.  \nPls.’ Stmt. ¶ 18.

ECF No. 1.   \nOn August 18, 2017, Plaintiff Orellana filed an amended complaint in which Plaintiff \nHernandez was added as a plaintiff, and the titles and names of certain defendants were altered.  \nECF Nos. 12-13.  Plaintiff Hernandez also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the \namended complaint.  Id.   \nOn January 1, 2018, the action was dismissed with respect to the federal Defendants.  \nECF No. 30. \nOn May 9, 2018, Plaintiff Orellana and Plaintiff Hernandez filed a second amended \ncomplaint, now operative, against (1) County of Suffolk; (2) Steven Bellone, County Executive, \nCounty of Suffolk, in his official capacity; (3) Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office; and (4) Errol \nToulon, Jr., Sheriff, Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, in his official capacity.

ECF No. 84.   \nOn July 30, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a fully briefed motion to certify a class, ECF Nos. 98, \n100, 101, which Defendants opposed, ECF No. 99.   \nOn November 12, 2021, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 113, \nwhich Plaintiffs opposed, ECF No. 115.  That same day, Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for \nsummary judgment, ECF No. 114, which Defendants opposed, ECF No. 116.   \nOn May 9, 2022, the Court denied both motions for summary judgment, without opinion \nand without prejudice, with leave to renew.  ECF No. 123.  The Court reaffirmed its denial on \nMay 12, 2022.  ECF No. 125.   \nOn August 31, 2022, Magistrate Judge Arlene R.

On September 14, 2022, Defendants timely filed objections \nto the R&R.  ECF No. 130.  On September 27, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to \nDefendants’ objections to the R&R.  ECF No. 132.   \nOn July 1, 2024, following oral argument, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for class \ncertification and directed the parties to refile their cross-motions for summary judgment, which \nare currently before the Court.  See Order Adopting R&R.   \nC.  People ex rel. Wells v. DeMarco \nOn November 14, 2018, during the pendency of this litigation, the Second Department \nissued a decision in People ex rel. Wells v. DeMarco, in which they considered the issue of \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 10 of 34 PageID\n#: 4580\n“whether New York law permits New York state and local law enforcement officers to effectuate \ncivil immigration arrests.”  168 A.D.3d 31, 34 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep’t 2018). \nThe Wells case centers on Susai Francis, a citizen of India who entered the United States \non a work visa in 1996 which allowed him to remain in the country for six months.  Id.  Francis \ndid not leave the United States after the term of his visa expired, but rather stayed in Long Island \nfor over two decades with his family.  Id.  On June 14, 2017, Francis was arrested on two \nmisdemeanor counts and was held in Nassau County Correctional Center.  Id.  Upon his arrest by \nlocal law enforcement, ICE provided a detainer and arrest warrant to the Nassau County Policy \nDepartment, requesting “the Police Department notify ICE as soon as practicable before Francis \nwas released from custody, on at least 48 hours’ notice, if possible.”  Id. at 35.  On December 4, \n2017, after being transferred to the custody of Suffolk County for proceedings in his case, \nFrancis pled guilty to one count of disorderly conduct in Suffolk County District Court and was \nsentenced to time served.  Id.  However, Francis was not released and was instead remanded \nfrom the Nassau County Correctional Center to the Suffolk County Correctional Facility in \nRiverhead (the “Riverhead facility”).  Id.  Francis’s paperwork was “‘re-written’ from being an \n‘adult male misdemeanor’ case to be being an ‘adult male warrant’ case based on the ICE \nwarrant, and Francis was regarded by the Sheriff as being in the custody of ICE.  Francis was \nplaced in a jail cell rented by ICE.”  Id. at 36.  This action, the Wells court found, was consistent \nwith policy issued by the SCSO on December 2, 2016, “under which inmates subject to either an \nICE detainer accompanied by a United States Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter \nDHS) Warrant for Arrest of Alien, and/or DHS Warrant of Removal/Deportation, are to be held \nfor up to 48 hours after the time they would otherwise have been released, with ICE to be \nnotified immediately.”  Id. at 35. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 11 of 34 PageID\n#: 4581\nWhile Francis was at the Riverhead facility, Jordan Wells, an attorney with the New York \nCivil Liberties Union Foundation, filed a habeas petition on Francis’s behalf, challenging the \nconstitutionality of Francis’s confinement and detention pursuant to the ICE warrant and \ndetainer.  Id. at 36.   \nTwo days after being remanded to the Riverhead facility, ICE agents retrieved Francis \nand transferred him to a long-term ICE detention facility.  Id.  As of January 5, 2018, Francis \nwas in ICE custody at the Bergen County Jail in Hackensack, New Jersey, pending removal \nproceedings in Immigration Court.  Id.   \nThe Wells court focused primarily on the question of whether detention pursuant to an \nICE detainer and warrant constitutes an arrest, and, if so, whether New York State law \nenforcement officials have authority to make such arrests.  Id. at 39-40.  The Wells court first \ndiscussed the issue of the arrest:  \nNew York state and federal law mirror each other regarding what constitutes an \narrest (see Florida v Royer, 460 US 491, 502 [1983] [a showing of official authority \nsuch that “a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave” \nindicates that an arrest has occurred under the Fourth Amendment of the United \nState Constitution (internal quotation marks omitted)]; People v Yukl, 25 NY2d \n585, 589 [1969] [a suspect is in custody when a reasonable person innocent of any \ncrime would not have believed he or she was free to leave the presence of the \npolice]).  With respect to immigration detainers, the federal courts have held that a \ncontinued detention on that basis after an inmate is entitled to release constitutes a \nnew arrest (see Morales v Chadbourne, 793 F3d 208, 217 [1st Cir 2015] [since an \nindividual was “kept in custody for a new purpose after she was entitled to release, \nshe was subjected to a new seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes—one that must \nbe supported by a new probable cause justification”]; Moreno v Napolitano, 213 F \nSupp 3d 999, 1005 [ND Ill 2016] [federal government conceded that detention of \nan individual pursuant to an ICE detainer constitutes an arrest]). \n \nId.  Because Francis was entitled to release after being sentenced to time served on his state \ncharges but was nonetheless held following that date pursuant to an ICE warrant and detainer, \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 12 of 34 PageID\n#: 4582\nthe Wells court found “he was subjected to a new arrest and seizure under both New York law \nand the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.”  Id. at 40.   \n  Having determined that there was a subsequent arrest pursuant to the ICE detainer, and \nafter noting that the arrest warrant pursuant to which Francis was held was civil, as opposed to \ncriminal, in nature, the Court then turned to the question of whether local law enforcement had \nauthority to effectuate those arrests.  Id. at 40-41. \n  The court first looked to New York Statutory Law for authority for these arrests but \nfound the civil warrants at issue did not fall under one of the “three types of warrants” \nrecognized for bringing a defendant before a court.  Id. at 42 (citing CPL 120.10; CPL 210.10; \nCPL 530.70).  While the court recognized there are some additional situations in which a local \nlaw enforcement officer can make an arrest, all of those situations involve a judicial or quasi-\njudicial determination.  Id.  Further, the Wells court found these officers, while empowered to \nmake warrantless arrests in some circumstances, are not authorized to effectuate warrantless \narrests for civil violations.  Id. at 43.  Therefore, the Wells court concluded the officers had no \nauthority under New York Statutory law to effectuate these arrests.  Id. at 44.  \n  The court also rejected the SCSO and DOJ’s argument that “even if New York state and \nlocal law enforcement officers are not statutorily authorized to execute federal immigration arrest \nwarrants, such arrests are nevertheless permissible under the broad state police powers \nrecognized at common law, there being no New York statute that prohibits such arrests.”  Id.  \nThe court found that, “while it may be acknowledged that New York possesses broad reserved \npolice powers, it does not follow that the existence of such powers supports civil immigration \narrests by state and local law enforcement.”  Id. at 45.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 13 of 34 PageID\n#: 4583\n  The Wells court also declined to find that the fellow officer rule provided authority for \nthese arrests.  Id. at 47.  The fellow officer rule allows a local law enforcement officer to “make a \nlawful arrest even without personal knowledge sufficient to establish probable cause, so long as \nthe officer is acting upon the direction of an officer in possession of information sufficient to \nconstitute probable cause for the arrest.”  Id. (quoting People v Ketcham, 93 NY2d 416, 419 \n(1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Wells court explained:  “even if it is assumed \nthat an ICE officer has probable cause to arrest for an immigration violation, the fellow officer, \nin this case the Sheriff’s officers, must still make a ‘lawful’ arrest.  If there is no authority to \narrest for a civil matter, such arrest cannot be considered ‘lawful.’  To adopt the position \nadvocated by the Sheriff here would permit state and local law enforcement to assume the \nauthority of an ICE officer, though not granted by state law, based upon nothing more than a \nrequest from ICE.”  Id. \n  Finally, the Wells court turned to the question of whether state and local law enforcement \nofficers are authorized by federal law to make civil immigration arrest.  Id.  “Assuming, without \ndeciding,” the Wells court wrote, “that the Congress may constitutionally convey authority to \nstate and local officials to effectuate arrests which state law does not authorize, we conclude that \nthe Congress has not done so with regard to the circumstances presented by this case.”  Id. at 48.   \n  In reaching this conclusion, the court first looked to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure, which governs the execution of federal arrest warrants.  Id.  The court found \n“[w]hile there is no question that New York law enforcement officers may execute federal court \narrest warrants issued for the purpose of bringing to court individuals accused of the commission \nof federal immigration crimes, the ICE warrant at issue here was not issued in the context of a \ncriminal action and was not signed by, or on behalf of, a court and was not returnable in a court.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 14 of 34 PageID\n#: 4584\nThus, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not empower New York state and local law \nenforcement officers to execute ICE administrative arrest warrants.”  Id.   \n  The court then turned to the question of whether the SCSO was authorized under the INA \nto make these arrests.  The court found the SCSO “does not have a 287 (g) agreement with DHS.  \nRather, the Sheriff has long had an agreement with the United States Marshals Service pursuant \nto which federal detainees may be housed at the Riverhead facility.”  Id.   \n  After determining that there was no formal agreement pursuant to Section 287(g), the \nWells court then addressed whether this conduct was authorized under subsection 287(g)(10), \nwhich allows “‘any officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State’ [to] \n‘cooperate with the [Secretary] in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of \naliens not lawfully present in the United States’ without any formal agreement.”  Id. at 50 \n(quoting 8 USC § 1357(g)(10)(B)).  The Wells court found there was no informal agreement \njustifying these arrests: \nIn those instances where the Congress has chosen to permit local officers to enforce \nfederal immigration laws absent a formal 287 (g) agreement, it has explicitly \nallowed that power only in narrowly drawn circumstances.  Given that Tenth \nAmendment concerns may prevent the Congress from mandating that local entities \nenforce immigration law (see City of El Cenizo, Texas v Texas, 890 F3d at 180-\n181), and the resulting circumspection with which the Congress has approached the \nissue of state and local involvement in matters of federal immigration policy, we \ncannot accede to the view that the Congress, through its provision for voluntary \ninformal cooperation, thereby authorized state and local law enforcement officers \nto undertake actions not allowed them by state law. \n \nId. at 52.   \n  In conclusion, the court explained the “narrow issue in this case is whether New York \nlaw permits New York state and local law enforcement officers to effectuate civil immigration \narrests, and not whether federal civil immigration officers have the authority to effectuate such \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 15 of 34 PageID\n#: 4585\narrests.”  Id. at 53.  The Court maintained it was not “decid[ing] any issues under federal law \ndeputizing state and local law enforcement officers to act as federal immigration officers.”  Id.  \n“Determining only the narrow issue before us, we conclude that the Sheriff’s policy, issued on \nDecember 2, 2016, directing the retention of prisoners, who would otherwise be released, \npursuant to ICE detainers and administrative warrants is unlawful, and that Francis’s detention \nby the Sheriff on December 11, 2017, which detention commenced after the termination of \nFrancis’s court proceeding that day, was thus unlawful.”  Id.  Notably, the Wells court said it did \nnot reach the question of whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation:  “In view of our \ndetermination on a narrow issue of New York law, we need not consider the petitioner’s \ncontention that Francis’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated.”  Id. at 54 n. 9.   \nD.  The Parties’ Summary Judgment Motions  \n  In their motion for summary judgment, Defendants first argue Plaintiffs’ claims that the \nCounty violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the federal and New York state constitutions should be \ndismissed as a matter of law.  See generally Defs.’ Mem.  Defendants first contend Plaintiffs do \nnot have standing to sue the County for complying with federal detainer requests.  Id. at 3-5, 7.  \nSecond, Defendants argue Plaintiffs claim that Defendants violated the state constitution should \nbe dismissed as a matter of law because (i) Wells is not determinative of Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaim, because (ii) any rule of liability stemming from Wells would be preempted, and because \n(iii) the Court should decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction.  Id. at 6-11.  Third, Defendants \nargue Plaintiffs’ federal claims must be dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to meet the \nrequirements of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”) and Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of \nN.Y., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  Id. at 11-15.  Fourth, Defendants argue Plaintiffs have failed to show, \nas a matter of law, Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Id. at 15-17.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 16 of 34 PageID\n#: 4586\nFifth and finally, Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Fourth \nAmendment claims because the detainers were based on probable cause and because Plaintiffs \ndid not possess a Fourth Amendment right to be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours.  Id. \nat 17-25.   \n  Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment as to liability on their Fourth Amendment and \nstate law claims.  See generally Pls.’ Mem.  Plaintiffs argue first that Defendants’ failure to serve \ndetainer requests on Plaintiffs rendered those detainers unenforceable, in violation of state and \nfederal law.  Id. at 8-9.  Plaintiffs then argue, under the Framework laid out in Monell, they are \nentitled to summary judgment on their federal claims.  Id. at 10-14.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue \nDefendants are liable as a matter of law with respect to Plaintiffs’ state law claims because Wells \nis binding on Defendants.  Id. at 14-17. \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nSummary judgment is appropriate where “the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law” based \non the materials in the record.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A genuine dispute exists if a reasonable \njury could find in favor of the non-moving party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n248 (1986); see also Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 212 (2d Cir. \n2001).  Courts evaluating motions for summary judgment must “construe the facts in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable \ninferences against the movant.”  Brod v. Omya, Inc., 653 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  Once the moving party offers evidence that there is no \ngenuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party then “must show the presence of a genuine \nissue by coming forward with evidence that would be sufficient, if all reasonable inferences were \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 17 of 34 PageID\n#: 4587\ndrawn in his favor, to establish the existence of that element at trial.”  United States v. Rem, 38 \nF.3d 634, 643 (2d Cir. 1994).  The role of the district court is not to weigh the evidence and to \ndetermine the truth of the matter, but rather to answer “the threshold inquiry” of “whether there \nis the need for a trial.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50.  \nIV.  APPLICABLE LAW \nE.  Federal Claims \na)  Section 1983: \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”) provides a cause of action to individuals challenging \nthe constitutionality of actions taken by state or local government officials.  Section 1983 states, \nin relevant part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \nbe subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction \nthereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in \nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “In order to prevail on a claim against a municipality under section 1983 \nbased on acts of a public official, a plaintiff is required to prove:  (1) actions taken under color of \nlaw; (2) deprivation of a constitutional or statutory right; (3) causation; (4) damages; and (5) that \nan official policy of the municipality caused the constitutional injury.”  Roe v. City of Waterbury, \n542 F.3d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Monell v. Dep’t of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690–91 \n(1978)).  While an “official policy” can be one embodied in a municipal regulation, it is not true \nthat “senior officials must have formally adopted or promulgated a policy before their conduct \nmay be treated as ‘official.’”  Turpin v. Mailet, 619 F.2d 196, 200 (2d Cir. 1980).  Indeed, if a \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 18 of 34 PageID\n#: 4588\nmunicipality “impliedly or tacitly authorized, approved or encouraged” certain conduct, “it \npromulgated an official policy within the meaning of Monell.”  Id. at 201.   \nb)  Fourth Amendment: \nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures:  \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants \nshall  issue,  but  upon  probable  cause,  supported  by  Oath  or  affirmation,  and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \nseized. \n \nU.S. Const. amend. IV.  \n“The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable seizures; it is not a general prohibition \nof all conduct that may be deemed unreasonable, unjustified or outrageous.”  Medeiros v. \nO'Connell, 150 F.3d 164, 167 (2d Cir. 1998).  The “first step in any Fourth Amendment claim \n(or, as in this case, any section 1983 claim predicated on the Fourth Amendment) is to determine \nwhether there has been a constitutionally cognizable seizure.”  Id.  \nOnce it has been determined that a seizure occurred, a court must then determine whether \nthat seizure was reasonable.  Caldarola v. Cnty. of Westchester, 343 F.3d 570, 574 (2d Cir. 2003).  \n“Generally, a seizure amounting to an arrest ‘is not reasonable unless it is accomplished pursuant \nto a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause.’”  Jones v. Cnty. of Suffolk, 936 F.3d 108, 114 \n(2d Cir. 2019) (quoting Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass'n,, 489 U.S. 602, 619, (1989).   \nc)  Fourteenth Amendment:   \nThe constitutional guarantees of procedural and substantive due process are found in the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  “Procedural \ndue process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 19 of 34 PageID\n#: 4589\nor ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth \nAmendment.”  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).  “Freedom from imprisonment—\nfrom government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint—lies at the heart of the \nliberty that Clause protects.”  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001).   \nAs to substantive due process, “[w]hen a right is ‘fundamental,’ governmental regulation \nmust be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.  Rights are fundamental in the \nsubstantive due process framework when they are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, or \ndeeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”  Molinari v. Bloomberg, 596 F. Supp. 2d \n546, 567 (E.D.N.Y.) (Sifton, J.), aff’d, 564 F.3d 587 (2d Cir. 2009). \nF.  State Law Claims  \na)  N.Y. Const. Art. I § 12 \nThe protections against unreasonable searches or seizures guaranteed by the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution are mirrored in Article I, Section 12 of the New \nYork State Constitution, which reads in relevant part:   \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants \nshall  issue,  but  upon  probable  cause,  supported  by  oath  or  affirmation,  and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \nseized. \n \nN.Y. Const. Art. I § 12.  “Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article \nI, § 12 of the New York Constitution prohibit ‘unreasonable searches and seizures’ (U.S. Const \nAmend IV; NY Const, art I, § 12).  Under the Fourth Amendment, ‘a person is seized only when, \nby means of physical force or a show of authority, [their] freedom of movement is restrained’ and, \nto determine this, courts examine ‘all of the circumstances surrounding the incident’ and ask \nwhether ‘a reasonable person would have believed that [they were] not free to leave.’”  People v. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 20 of 34 PageID\n#: 4590\nRodriguez, 229 N.E.3d 1120, 1123–24 (2023) (quoting United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, \n553 [1980]). \n \nV.  ANALYSIS  \nA.  Standing  \n  Article III of the United States Constitution limits federal courts to resolving “Cases” and \n“Controversies.”  Art. III, § 2.  Article III standing contains three elements:  “First, the plaintiff \nmust have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) \nconcrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Second, \nthere must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury \nhas to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the \nindependent action of some third party not before the court.  Third, it must be likely, as opposed \nto merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) \n(cleaned up).   \nDefendants argue the Court should not reach the merits because Plaintiffs “cannot \nestablish even one of the three irreducible elements of standing, let alone all three.”  Defs.’ Mem. \nat 4.  They first cite United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), for the proposition that standing \ncannot be established because “the judiciary’s interference” in the area of immigration policy is \nprohibited.  Id.  However, as Defendants correctly point out, Texas involved a challenge, brought \nby Texas and Louisiana, to DHS immigration enforcement Guidelines on the grounds the “new \nGuidelines violate federal statutes that purportedly require the Department to arrest more \ncriminal noncitizens pending their removal.”  Texas, 599 U.S. at 673-74.  In other words, Texas \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 21 of 34 PageID\n#: 4591\nand Louisiana wanted the federal government to arrest more people than the new Guidelines \npermitted, arguing those Guidelines were inconsistent with the statute pursuant to which they \nwere promulgated.  Id.  The Supreme Court found the states lacked standing for the same reason \n“a citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is \nneither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.”  Id. (quoting Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 \nU. S. 614, 619, (1973)).  Because the federal government’s decision not to prosecute did not \n“infringe upon interests that courts often are called upon to protect,” such as “an individual’s \nliberty or property,” the Court could not entertain the case.  Id. at 678.  Plaintiffs in this case \nclearly do allege their liberty interests were infringed.  As such, the reasoning in Texas does not \napply.   \n  With respect to injury-in-fact, Defendants contend Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a \ncognizable theory of harm because “an arrest pursuant to ICE detainers and warrants based on \nprobable cause” does not constitute a Fourth Amendment violation.  Defs.’ Mem at 5.  However, \nPlaintiffs have alleged and provided evidentiary support for the proposition the detainers were \nineffective, having never been served, as well as for the proposition Defendants lacked the \nstatutory authority required to confer probable cause.  See generally Pls.’ Mem; Exs. to Badini \nDecl.; 8 U.S.C. 1357(g).  The Court finds Plaintiffs, who argue they were detained past the time \nthe SCSO had authority to hold them, have satisfied the injury requirement of Article III \nstanding.  \n  Defendants’ contention that Plaintiffs failed to establish causation fails for similar \nreasons.  Defendants assert it was ICE, not Defendants, who were the cause of Plaintiffs harm.  \nDefs.’ Mem. at 5.  However, Plaintiffs allege it was Defendants who arrested them, without state \nor federal authority to do so, resulting in their loss of liberty.  See generally SAC; Pls.’ Mem.  It \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 22 of 34 PageID\n#: 4592\nis undisputed that the SCSO had a policy of honoring detainer requests absent a Section 287(g) \nagreement.  See supra Part II-A.  Indeed, Defendants assert their actions were “in compliance \nwith N.Y. Const. art. I § 12.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 21.  While that compliance is in dispute, there is \nno question that the SCSO’s arrest authority is generally derived from the state and its police \npower.  This is not to say the alleged harms may not also be traceable to the actions of the federal \ngovernment, but that does not negate the causation element with respect to Defendants.    \n  As for redressability, Defendants argue that, because Plaintiffs are noncitizens seeking \nmoney damages, the alleged harms cannot be redressed because this is not the type of case \nhistorically heard by the Court.  Defs.’ Mem. at 6.  However, as Plaintiffs note, whether a \nperson’s rights can be vindicated in federal court does not turn on whether they are a citizen.  See \nPls.’ Opp’n at 15 (citing Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 122 (2d Cir. 2018); Miranda-\nOlivares v. Clackamas County, 12-CV-02317, 2014 WL 1414305 (D. Or. Apr. 11, 2014); INS v. \nLopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1046 (1984)).  These kinds of harms have been redressed in the \npast and the Court sees no reason why that cannot be the case here.   \n  The Court is satisfied Plaintiffs have established the elements of Article III standing.  \nB.  State Law Claims \nPlaintiffs allege Defendants “deprived Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed \nClass and Sub-Class of liberty without due process of law in contravention of the First Article of \nthe New York Constitution.”  SAC ¶ 63.   \nPlaintiffs argue the Second Department’s decision in Wells is determinative of Plaintiffs’ \nstate law claims in this case and, as a result, they are entitled to summary judgment on those \nclaims.  Pls.’ Mem. at 14-17.  Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment on \nPlaintiffs state law claims because the detention did not violate the constitution, the Supremacy \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 23 of 34 PageID\n#: 4593\nClause preempts state law, and because the Court should decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction.  \nSee Defs.’ Mem. at 6-11; Defs.’ Opp’n at 20-24. \nAs discussed above, the Second Department, in a case with the same Defendants, \ndetermined that civil arrests such as the ones in question are not authorized under New York law.  \nSee generally People ex rel. Wells v. DeMarco, 168 A.D.3d 31, 34 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep’t \n2018); supra Part II-C.  The Second Department’s determination that the SCSO’s policy of \n“directing the retention of prisoners, who would otherwise be released, pursuant to ICE detainers \nand administrative warrants” violates New York law is binding on Defendant’s under the \ndoctrine of collateral estoppel.  Wells, 168 A.D.3d at 53.  “Under New York law, the doctrine of \ncollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, ‘bars a party from relitigating in a subsequent proceeding \nan issue clearly raised in a prior proceeding and decided against that party where the party to be \nprecluded had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination.’”  Johnson v. \nWatkins, 101 F.3d 792, 794 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting Weiss v. Manfredi, 83 N.Y.2d 974, 976 \n(1994)).  The exact issue addressed in Wells is at issue here.  See supra Part II-C.  Further, as \nPlaintiffs point out, the Wells proceeding “included several opportunities for the parties to be \nheard.  Oral argument was held on December 12, 2017, before a panel of the Second \nDepartment.  The Wells court also invited the parties and various amici to file supplemental \npleadings and briefs, which they did.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 5.  Defendants’ contention that the fact \nWells was a habeas proceeding bars collateral estoppel is unavailing, as issues litigated in habeas \ncorpus proceedings have provided the basis for collateral estoppel in this circuit in the past.  See, \ne.g., Kulak v. City of New York, 88 F.3d 63, 71-72 (2d Cir. 1996). \nNonetheless, Defendants argue the Court should reject the analysis of the Wells court, \narguing its reasoning was “unsound.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 8.  Specifically, Defendants argue the \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 24 of 34 PageID\n#: 4594\nWells decision “overlook[s] and disregard[s] the binding nature upon state courts of US Supreme \nCourt determinations that an immigration detention is a civil arrest which may be effectuated \npursuant to an administrative warrant issued by a federal agent in accordance with federal \nstatutes.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 8-9.  However, as explained above, whether a state or local officer has \nauthority to effectuate these arrests turns on whether Section 287(g) applies to those officers.  \nThe Wells court found federal law did not authorize the arrests because there was no Section \n287(g) agreement and the cooperation provision of 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10) did not apply.  \nReading that subsection to allow local officers to effectuate arrests absent a formal agreement \nwould, the Wells court reasoned, be in inconsistent with the purposes of Congress in enacting the \nlegislation and would itself raise Tenth Amendment Concerns.  See Wells, 168 A.D.3d at 52.   \nWe agree that federal law does not authorize these arrests.  It is undisputed that the SCSO \ndid not have a formal Section 287(g) agreement.  Statement of Interest of the United States at 2, \nECF No. 80; Brief Amicus Curiae of State of New York at 6, 11, ECF No. 159-1.  Further, New \nYork itself has stated that the cooperation provision of 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10) does not apply \nhere and would in fact be inconsistent with state law.  Brief Amicus Curiae of State of New York \nat 11-12; see also Wells, 168 A.D.3d at 48-52.  As discussed above, see supra Part I, whether a \nlocal law enforcement agency assists ICE in its apprehension of aliens pursuant to the INA is \nvoluntary.  The statute itself only contemplates such assistance where it is “consistent with State \nand local law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  Where, as here, the law of the state prohibits the conduct \nthat the cooperation subsection contemplates, that subsection cannot reasonably be interpreted as \napplying.   \nIndeed, the suggestion that 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10) renders all detainers issued to local \nlaw enforcement officials enforceable regardless of whether the state itself allows such \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 25 of 34 PageID\n#: 4595\nenforcement would potentially run afoul of the Tenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  See Galarza v. Szalczyk, 745 F.3d 634, 643 (3d Cir. 2014) (“Under the Tenth \nAmendment, immigration officials may not order state and local officials to imprison suspected \naliens subject to removal at the request of the federal government.”); City of El Cenizo, Texas v. \nTexas, 890 F.3d 164, 178 (5th Cir. 2018) (“[T]he Tenth Amendment prevents Congress from \ncompelling Texas municipalities to cooperate in immigration enforcement” (citing Printz v. \nUnited States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997))).  The Court declines to read 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(10) as \nproviding the authority for the SCSO to effectuate civil immigration arrests, without a formal \nagreement, when such arrests would contravene state law.  \nThe cases Defendants cite for the proposition that inconsistency with state law should \nhave no bearing on the applicability of the INA detainer provisions are inapposite.  City of El \nCenizo, Texas v. Texas, 890 F.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2018), involved a Texas law that “specifically \nmandated that Texas law enforcement agencies comply with ICE detainer requests.”  See 168 A.D.3d \nat 52 (citing 890 F.3d at 174).  As such, the Court determined the cooperation provision of 8 U.S.C. § \n1357(g)(10) applied.  While Defendants are correct that the court in Gonzalez v. United States \nImmigr. & Customs Enf’t, 975 F.3d 788 (9th Cir. 2020), stated the “constitutionality of a \nwarrantless arrest under the Fourth Amendment does not depend on whether state law authorizes \nstate or local officers to make the arrest, but on whether there is probable cause,” Defs.’ Mem. at \n22 (quoting Gonzalez, 975 F.3d at 818), Gonzalez involved no discussion of 1357(g) and instead \nwas concerned with another statutory provision.  Defendants have provided no caselaw \nsuggesting an immigration arrest made in violation of state law and undertaken by local law \nenforcement officers who do not fall within the purview of 8 U.S.C. 1357(g) is nonetheless \nproper.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 26 of 34 PageID\n#: 4596\n  Defendants cite Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012), for the proposition that \nPlaintiffs claims are preempted.  Defs.’ Mem. at 21-24.  However, unlike Arizona, this case does \nnot implicate the Supremacy clause.  In Arizona, the state passed a law that “attempt[ed] to \nprovide state officers even greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible removability \nthan Congress has given to trained federal immigration officers.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 408.  By \nentrusting its state officers with authority beyond that envisioned by Congress, Arizona’s statute \n“violate[d] the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal \nGovernment.”  Id. at 409.  No legislation or policy, separate from that provided by Congress in 8 \nU.S.C. § 1357(g) is at issue in this case.  Rather, this case raises the question of whether, in the \nabsence of a voluntary agreement or cooperation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g), local law \nenforcement can nonetheless effectuate civil arrests pursuant to ICE detainers using the process \nlaid out in that statute.  As the Court explained in Arizona, “federal law specifies limited \ncircumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.”  Id. \nat 408.  The question here is whether such a circumstance existed, and, if not, whether Plaintiffs \nrights were violated as a result.   \n  The Court declines to declare the reasoning of the Wells court “unsound.”  Because the \nWells court found the exact practice at issue here to be in violation of New York law, and \nbecause Defendants had a fair opportunity to litigate that issue, the doctrine of collateral estoppel \nprecludes Defendants’ argument.  Further, even addressing the issues on the merits, we agree \nwith the Wells court.  Summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs is warranted as to the state law \nclaims.   \nC.  1983 Claims \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 27 of 34 PageID\n#: 4597\n  Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment \nClaims, arguing Plaintiffs have not satisfied the requirements of Section 1983 and Monell.  \nDefs.’ Mem. at 11-15.  Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to summary on their Fourth Amendment \nclaim.  Pls.’ Mem. at 8-14.  We will analyze each Monell element in turn.  \na)  Official Policy \nDefendants themselves admit they had an official policy of honoring detainer requests \nduring the relevant time period.  See supra Part II-A.  Defendants argue, however, that because \nthe SCSO was simply complying with the federal government’s policy, it is properly understood \nas a federal, as opposed to a municipal, policy.  Defs.’ Mem. at 14.  As a result, Defendants \nargue Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the first requirement of Monell.  However, as discussed above, the \npower did not flow from the federal government.  The County, without a formal agreement and \nin contravention of state law, honored immigration detainer requests and effectuated civil arrests, \noften without properly serving those detainers.  The practice of honoring detainers without the \nauthority of 8 U.S.C. § 1357 is a municipal policy.  \nb)  Causation \nDefendants also argue Plaintiffs have failed to show the policy caused the alleged harm, \nas required for Section 1983 claims, because ICE “was the moving force behind the alleged \ndeprivations.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 14.  However, the policy adopted by the SCSO was distinct from \nICE’s policy—indeed the issue stems from the fact the SCSO was acting without the federal \nstatutory authority to do so.  Additionally, as discussed supra Part V-A, while Defendants are \ncorrect that Plaintiffs’ alleged harm is also traceable to ICE, the actual issuer of the detainers, \nthat is not to say the SCSO’s policy did not cause Plaintiffs’ harm.  The record demonstrates the \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 28 of 34 PageID\n#: 4598\nPlaintiffs’ alleged Fourth Amendment violation was a result of the SCSO’s policy of honoring \ndetainer requests.   \nc)  Deprivation of a Constitutional Right  \nPlaintiffs move for summary judgment only with respect to their Fourth Amendment \nclaim, while Defendants move for summary judgment on both the Fourth Amendment and \nFourteenth Amendment claims.  \n(1)  Fourth Amendment \nPlaintiffs allege their Fourth Amendment rights were violated because they were seized \nby the SCSO after they otherwise would have been released without probable cause.  As \ndiscussed above, where an individual is seized without probable cause to believe he or she \ncommitted a crime, that seizure generally contravenes the Fourth Amendment.  See generally \nBailey v. United States, 568 U.S. 186, 192 (2013).  Because Plaintiffs bring this claim pursuant \nto Section 1983, which was enacted against the backdrop of common-law tort principles, “[t]o \ndetermine the precise contours of a constitutional claim under § 1983 . . . a court should identify \nthe ‘most analogous’ common-law tort to the constitutional harm.”  Chiaverini v. City of \nNapoleon, Ohio, 602 U.S. 556, 561 (2024) (quoting Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.S. 357, 370 (2017)). \n“A § 1983 claim for false arrest, resting on the Fourth Amendment right of an individual \nto be free from unreasonable seizures, including arrest without probable cause is substantially the \nsame as a claim for false arrest under New York law.”  Burden v. Inc. Vill. of Port Jefferson, 664 \nF. Supp. 3d 276, 284–85 (E.D.N.Y. 2023)(Brown, J.) (quoting Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, \n852 (2d Cir. 1996)).  A false arrest claim requires a Plaintiff to demonstrate the following \nelements:  “(1) the defendant intended to confine the plaintiff, (2) the plaintiff was conscious of \nthe confinement, (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement, and (4) the confinement \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 29 of 34 PageID\n#: 4599\nwas not otherwise privileged.”  Id. at 285 (quoting Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 75 \n(2d Cir. 2003)).  \nDefendants argue the confinement was privileged because “an act of confinement is \nprivileged if it stems from a lawful arrest supported by probable cause.”  Defs. Mem. at 19 \n(quoting Hernandez v. United States, 939 F.3d 191, 199 (2d Cir. 2019)).  Defendants assert the \nICE detainers provided probable cause.  Id.  They further contend it is immaterial that the arrests \nwere civil in nature and ran contrary to state law.  Id. at 15, 20-23.   \nDefendants are correct that various courts have held the absence of state authority to \neffectuate an arrest does not automatically mean an arrestee’s Fourth Amendment rights were \nviolated.  In Virginia v. Moore, the Supreme Court addressed the question of “whether a police \nofficer violates the Fourth Amendment by making an arrest based on probable cause but \nprohibited by state law.”  553 U.S. 164, 166 (2008).  In that case, Virginia police officers \narrested Moore for driving with a suspended license.  Id. at 166-67.  Under Virginia law, driving \nwith a suspended license is not an “arrestable” offense, and therefore the issuance of a summons \nwould have been the proper approach under Virginia law.  Id. at 167.  However, the Court found \nthat the unlawfulness of the arrest under state law did not mean the officers had violated Moore’s \nFourth Amendment when the seizure was otherwise reasonable and supported by probable cause:  \n“We conclude that warrantless arrests for crimes committed in the presence of an arresting \nofficer are reasonable under the Constitution, and that while States are free to regulate such \narrests however they desire, state restrictions do not alter the Fourth Amendment’s protections.”  \nId. at 176; see also United States v. Turner, 553 F.3d 1337, 1342 (10th Cir. 2009) (“Fourth \nAmendment search and seizure protections do not turn on local law enforcement policies.”). \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 30 of 34 PageID\n#: 4600\nDefendants are also correct that certain courts have determined a civil immigration \ndetainer, which is supported by the reasonable belief that a person is a removable alien, confers \nsufficient probable cause for an arrest under the Fourth Amendment.  Defs.’ Mem at 20-23; see \nalso 8 U.S.C. § 1357.  Defendants cite Jimenez v. City of Cohoes Police Dep’t, for the \nproposition that circuits are split over the question of whether an ICE detainer and administrative \nwarrant, which are civil in nature, provide probable cause under the Fourth Amendment for local \nlaw enforcement officers to effectuate an arrest.  23-955, 2024 WL 1551149, at *2 n.2 (2d Cir. \nApr. 10, 2024) (describing circuit split).  Defendants argue Jimenez suggests “that the Second \nCircuit would align with the well-reasoned and compelling decisions of circuits which have \nfound that immigration detentions by local officials.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 20.   \nAs a preliminary matter, the Court does not read Jimenez as coming down on one side or \nthe other:  Because the officers in Jimenez had criminal probable cause to arrest the plaintiff, the \nCourt did not reach the issue of whether an arrest based solely on the ICE detainer would be \nimproper.  Jimenez, 2024 WL 1551149, at *2.   \nHowever, of more significance here, the cases cited by the Jimenez court and Defendants \ndiffer in an important respect from the case before the Court today:  The present case raises the \nquestion of whether, in the absence of federal authority, local law enforcement officers can \neffectuate civil immigration arrests that run contrary to state law, not whether the civil probable \ncause conferred by federal immigration officers on local officials is sufficient for Fourth \nAmendment purposes.  Unlike the cited cases, that there is probable cause at all—for a civil \nviolation or otherwise—is not a given here.  If one assumes Section 287(g) is the vehicle which \nconfers probable cause on local law enforcement, a premise which is disputed,3 it follows that \n \n3 8 U.S.C. 1357(g) does not contain any explicit language about probable cause.  Instead, it empowers federal \nagents, and local law enforcement when they have been deputized pursuant to a formal agreement, to make arrests \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 31 of 34 PageID\n#: 4601\nlocal law enforcement agencies not falling under the purview of this section of the INA cannot \nrely on federal immigration officials’ probable cause determinations.  See Abriq v. Hall, 295 F. \nSupp. 3d 874, 880 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) (explaining 8 U.S.C. § 1357 does not “give local agencies \nthe authority to provide that housing without probable cause, especially where, as here, no § 287 \nagreement exists between [the locality] and ICE”).   \nWe do not take a position as to whether local law enforcement officers violate the Fourth \nAmendment when making civil immigration arrests based on the “reasonable belief” conferred to \nlocal officials by federal immigration officers via the Immigration and Nationality Act.  \nHowever, given that the SCSO derived no authority from provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g), as \ndiscussed above, we conclude the SCSO had no “reasonable belief,” much less probable cause, \nfor these arrests as the existence of that belief or probable cause is premised on the applicability \nof the statute.  And because an arrest absent probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment, see \nJones v. Cnty. of Suffolk, 936 F.3d 108, 114 (2d Cir. 2019). we conclude Defendants’ seizures of \nPlaintiffs during the relevant period violated their Fourth Amendment rights.   \n(2)  Fourteenth Amendment \nPlaintiffs assert Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ substantive due process and procedural \ndue process rights, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \nSee SAC ¶¶ 67-73.  Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment due process claims fail \nas a matter of law.   \n \nwhen they have “reason to believe” an alien is in violation of certain laws.  Certain courts do not believe this can \nform the basis of a lawful arrest.  See Orellana v. Nobles Cnty., 230 F. Supp. 3d 934, 945 (D. Minn. 2017) (“having \n‘reason to believe [that Orellana] is an alien subject to removal from the United States’ does not, without more, \nprovide the probable cause needed to make a lawful arrest.” (quoting Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 \n(2012))).  \n \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 32 of 34 PageID\n#: 4602\n“To establish a violation of substantive due process rights, a plaintiff must demonstrate \nthat the state action was ‘so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the \ncontemporary conscience.’”  Okin v. Vill. of Cornwall-On-Hudson Police Dep’t, 577 F.3d 415, \n431 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n. 8, 118 S.Ct. \n1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)).   \nDefendants argue the substantive due process claim is improper because it is duplicative \nof Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim.  Defs.’ Mem. at 16.  Additionally, Defendants argue \ntheir conduct in the instant case does not rise to the level necessary to make out a substantive due \nprocess claim.  Id. at 15-16.   \nWe agree this claim is duplicative.  “In general, where ‘a particular amendment provides \nan explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government \nbehavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process, must be \nthe guide for analyzing these claims.’”  Hawthorne by Hawthorne v. Cnty. of Putnam, 492 F. \nSupp. 3d 281, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (Román, J.), (quoting Singer v. Fulton Cty. Sheriff, 63 F.3d \n110, 115 (2d Cir. 1995)); see also Johnson v.

For these \nreasons, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ substantive due process \nclaim is granted.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 33 of 34 PageID\n#: 4603\n“A procedural due process claim is composed of two elements:  (1) the existence of a \nproperty or liberty interest that was deprived and (2) deprivation of that interest without due \nprocess.”  Radwan v. Manuel, 55 F.4th 101, 123 (2d Cir. 2022) (quoting Bryant v. N.Y. State \nEduc. Dep’t, 692 F.3d 202, 218 (2d Cir. 2012)).  Procedural due process requires that deprivation \nof an individual’s liberty interest must “be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing.”  \nCleveland Bd. of Educ v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985). \nDefendants argue Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim fails as a matter of law because \nPlaintiffs did not “possess a liberty interest which shielded them from being arrested pursuant to \nICE detainer requests and arrest warrants since ‘[o]n a warrant issued by the Attorney General, \nan alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed \nfrom the United States.’”  Defs.’ Mem. at 17 (quoting 8 U.S.C. §1226(a)).  However, as \ndiscussed above, we find Defendants did not derive authority from the relevant federal statutes in \neffectuating these arrests.  The Court finds Plaintiffs have demonstrated a liberty interest, namely \ntheir right to be free from seizures absent probable cause.   \nDefendants then argue Plaintiffs’ due process claim must be dismissed because it is \n“predicated on the alleged unconstitutionality of their detention.”  Id. at 17.  While it is true, as \nwith substantive due process, that a plaintiff’s “procedural due process claim cannot be \npredicated upon the same factual basis as his Fourth Amendment false arrest and false \nimprisonment claims,” Levantino v. Skala, 56 F. Supp. 3d 191, 203 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Spatt, J.) \n(citing Osuna v. City of New York, 08-CV-4759, 2009 WL 2356424, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, \n2009) (Rakoff, J.)), it is less obvious here that the conduct underlying the procedural due process \nclaim is identical to that underlying the Fourth Amendment claim.  While the Court finds \nPlaintiffs have established a Fourth Amendment violation because they were arrested without \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-04267-WFK-ARL     Document 166     Filed 01/02/25     Page 34 of 34 PageID\n#: 4604\nprobable cause or the applicable statutory authority, they also assert facts related to Defendants’ \nfailures to serve detainers and Defendants’ failures to allow Plaintiffs to contest their detentions.  \nSee supra Part II-A; see also SAC ¶ 70 (alleging Plaintiffs had no opportunity to challenge their \ndeprivation).  The parties provide exceptionally little information concerning what opportunities \nPlaintiffs did have to challenge their detention.  See generally Pls.’ Stmt; Defs.’ Stmt.  As such, \nthe Court finds there is a question of material fact as to whether the second prong of the \nprocedural due process test has been met, rendering summary judgment for Defendants improper \non this claim.   \nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to liability is \nGRANTED, and Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED with respect to \nPlaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim and DENIED with respect to \nPlaintiffs’ other claims.   \nSO ORDERED. \ns/ WFK\nHON.
