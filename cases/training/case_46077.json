In so deciding, the Court follows Rule 15, which instructs courts to \"freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Absent reason for denial, including but not limited to \"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,\" the Court must grant a motion to amend. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). Because Defendant has failed to sufficiently demonstrate any such reason for denial, leave must be \"freely given.\" Id. (internal quotation marks removed). The Court further GRANTS Plaintiff's request to treat the pending cross motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 11 and Dkt. 25, as motions for partial summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims regarding the October 2019 fee-waiver actions. The Court further GRANTS Plaintiff leave to file a supplemental memorandum of no more than 15 pages in support of that motion on or before October 6, 2020. Defendant may file a response to that supplemental memorandum of no more than 15 pages on or before October 16, 2020. The Court further ORDERS that the parties appear telephonically for a status conference on September 1, 2020, at 2:00 p.m. to discuss briefing on Plaintiff's anticipated motion for a preliminary injunction. The Courtroom Deputy Clerk will provide the parties with the teleconference number and access code. Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on 08/29/2020. (lcrdm1) Modified on 8/31/2020 to add the word \"Minute\" in front of \"Order\" (no order attached). (kt)."

    "summary": "<p>On October 31, 2019, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (&ldquo;NIRP&rdquo;) filed a complaint against the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (&ldquo;USCIS&rdquo;) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, the complaint took issue with USCIS&rsquo;s decision to amend and heighten the standards by which individuals can qualify for waivers of fees associated with applying for immigration benefits. In adopting these changes to the regulation, the complaint alleged USCIS violated the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;) by failing to follow proper notice-and-comment rulemaking and because the changes themselves were alleged to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. NIRP sought for the court to declare the changes to be unlawful and to set aside the agency action. On November 21, NIRP filed an amended complaint; however, the allegations were not substantively different. The case was assigned to Randolph D. Moss and to Judge Ellen S. Huvelle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>NIRP filed a motion for summary judgment on December 12 on grounds that USCIS&rsquo;s changes to the fee-waiver standard were procedurally and substantively unlawful under the APA. An amicus brief was submitted by organizations serving immigrant survivors of violence in support of NIRP&rsquo;s summary judgment motion on January 22, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for the plaintiff&rsquo;s lack of Article III standing, or in the alternative, summary judgment in their favor. Proceedings were held on the matter in July 2020. However, shortly after, on August 21, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend and supplement the complaint. Notably, the Department of Homeland Security had promulgated a new rule (&ldquo;2020 Fee Rule&rsquo;) that sought to codify many of the changes that USCIS had initially sought to make without rulemaking. The court granted the motion to amend the complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second amended complaint was filed on August 29, 2020. The complaint added plaintiffs Ayuda, Inc. and Casa de Maryland, Inc&mdash;two non-profit organizations advocating for and supporting low-income immigrant communities&mdash;and added defendants as well, including the Department of Homeland Security and the then-Acting Secretary. The complaint continued to take issue with USCIS&rsquo;s attempted rulemaking for violations of the APA, but also took issue with the new 2020 Fee Rule for similar violations to the APA, namely failure to follow notice-and-comment, for being contrary to the statutory text of the Immigration and Nationality Act (&ldquo;INA&rdquo;), and for being arbitrary and capricious.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 3, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the 2020 Fee Rule&rsquo;s effective date be postponed and for a stay of implementation of the Rule pending conclusion of the proceedings. On September 10, the city of New York and 22 other local governments filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 8, 2020, the court granted the preliminary injunction. 496 F.Supp.3d 31. The court first determined the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the issue of standing. On the merits, the court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the APA challenge. The court, thus, ordered to stay the effective date of the Rule in its entirety, with the exception of those fees set by statute. The defendants then appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on December 7, 2020; however, the appeal was dismissed voluntarily. 2021 WL 161666.</p>\r\n<p>Following a joint status report after the inauguration of President Joseph Biden, the court stayed the case to allow the government to undertake a review of the challenged rules. The case continued to be stayed through 2021, 2022, and 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 31, 2024, the government published a final rule titled &ldquo;U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and Changes to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements.&rdquo; The 2024 Final Rule became effective on April 1, 2024, and replaced the 2020 Rule in its entirety. According to a May 2024 status report filed by the plaintiffs, the 2024 Final Rule was being challenged through two other cases: Moody v. Mayorkas, (D. Colo. Mar. 19, 2024), and Civitas Capital Management, LLC v. Mayorkas (N.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2024). The case continued to be stayed through 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2025, the court ordered the parties to either file a further joint status report or a stipulation of dismissal on or before August 13, 2025. The case, thus, remains ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

This suit challenges a decision of the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (USCIS) to  change the standards applicable to  individuals seeking waivers of the \nsubstantial fees that USCIS charges to apply for immigration benefits, including naturalization, \nlawful permanent residence, and humanitarian benefits that provide legal protections for survivors \nof domestic violence, human trafficking, and other crimes.  \n2.  USCIS’s decision, implemented by USCIS through changes to a USCIS form, its \ninstructions, and USCIS manuals, narrows the grounds on which individuals can qualify for fee \nwaivers. The decision also makes it harder for individuals to apply for fee waivers by requiring \nthat they obtain and submit certain specified forms of documentation from the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) or other sources.  \n1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 2 of 26\n3.  USCIS violated the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA) by adopting the new fee-waiver form and its instructions, which limit applicants’ ability to \nreceive fee waivers, without undertaking notice-and-comment rulemaking. USCIS also failed to \ncomply with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the statute under which it \npurported to adopt the new form and instructions. Further, the revisions to the form, instructions, \nand  USCIS  manuals  are  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with the law. USCIS failed to make clear its rationale for the changes, offered shifting \nand illogical justifications, and relied on assertions that lack supporting data, contradict each other, \nor contradict the data before the agency.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n5.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) is a nonprofit legal services \norganization founded in 1984 to defend and advance the rights of immigrants. To further its \nmission, NWIRP provides direct legal assistance in immigration matters to thousands of low-\nincome individuals each year. NWIRP also provides immigration-related advice and information \nthrough  community-based  know-your-rights  presentations  and  trainings  offered  to  service \nproviders and attorneys.  \n7.  Through its direct legal services, NWIRP helps low-income individuals seeking to \napply for a range of immigration benefits, including visas, asylum, employment authorization, \nlawful permanent residence, and naturalization. It prioritizes serving individuals who are in \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 3 of 26\nvulnerable circumstances or who face complex legal issues, including those who have been \nimpacted by the criminal legal system. \n8.  NWIRP’s work includes helping survivors of domestic and sexual violence gain \naccess to humanitarian protections. Principally, NWIRP represents these individuals in filing \napplications and petitions for benefits under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a \nstatutory framework that allows survivors of domestic abuse to apply for lawful permanent \nresidence without having to rely on their abusers; T or U visas, immigration benefits that Congress \ncreated to help survivors of human trafficking or crimes; and employment authorization or lawful \npermanent residence.  \n9.  NWIRP also assists individuals who are seeking naturalization, many of whom \nhave a disability or face other circumstances that may make the naturalization process complicated. \n10.  Further, NWIRP helps children and youth seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile \nStatus (SIJS), an immigration benefit available to those who were abandoned, abused, or neglected \nby their parents; individuals seeking asylum and related protections; and others. \n11.  NWIRP serves the community from four offices spread across Washington State. \nBecause of the high demand for its services, NWIRP maintains waiting lists of individuals seeking \nits services. \n12.  Defendant USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), \nan agency of the federal government. USCIS  adjudicates applications for lawful permanent \nresidence, naturalization, and other immigration benefits, including SIJS, VAWA self-petitions, \nand T and U visas. By regulation, USCIS sets and charges filing fees for a number of immigration-\nbenefit applications but allows waivers of certain such fees. \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 4 of 26\nBACKGROUND \n13.  Each year, millions of individuals apply for immigration benefits that can transform \ntheir lives. These benefits include humanitarian benefits, such as T and U visas, VAWA self-\npetitions, asylum, and SIJS; employment authorization and lawful permanent residence, which \nestablish individuals’ right to live and work in the United States; and naturalization, which enables \nindividuals to become citizens and fully participate in American life, including by voting.  \n14.  USCIS charges significant application fees for some benefits. For example, the \nagency  charges  $1,140  to  apply  to  become  a  lawful  permanent  resident;  $410  to  request \nemployment authorization; up to $455, plus an $85 biometrics fee, to replace a permanent resident \ncard; and up to $640, plus an $85 biometrics fee, to apply for naturalization. The agency also \ncharges $700 for an appeal in a naturalization matter, $675 for an appeal on VAWA self-petitions \nor T or U visas, and $930 for an application for a waiver of inadmissibility, which often \naccompanies a T or U visa application.  \n15.  For low-income individuals, USCIS application fees can be an insurmountable \nobstacle to applying for benefits.  \n16.  Forgoing an immigration-benefit application because the fee is too expensive can \nlead to devastating consequences for individuals. For example, a delay in seeking humanitarian \nbenefits can mean that a survivor of domestic violence or trafficking will suffer longer at the hands \nof an abuser, without access to legal rights and protections. A delay in seeking to naturalize can \nmean missing the right to vote in upcoming elections or losing access to public benefits that depend \non recipients naturalizing by a certain date. And in multiple circumstances, missing a filing \ndeadline can mean that an individual loses the chance to receive the immigration benefit altogether. \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 5 of 26\n17.  As  a  result,  fee  waivers  are  often  essential  to  allow  low-income  immigrants \nreasonable access to vital immigration benefits.  \nUSCIS’s Fee and Fee-Waiver Statute and Regulation \n18.  The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes USCIS to set fees for adjudication \nand naturalization services at levels that ensure full cost-recovery, but also provides for fee waivers \nand exemptions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m). The Act permits the agency to set fees to cover services \n“provided without charge to asylum applicants or other immigrants.” Id. Further, it requires that \nDHS allow individuals seeking certain forms of humanitarian benefits, including T and U visas \nand VAWA benefits, “to apply for a waiver of any fees associated with filing an application for \nrelief through final adjudication of the adjustment of status.” 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7). Additionally, \nthe statute enumerates certain fee exemptions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1439(b)(4). \n19.  By regulation, USCIS has established a fee schedule and provided for fee waivers \nand exemptions.  \n20.  Under the regulation’s principal fee-waiver provision, 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c), USCIS \ncan waive listed fees if the requester is “unable to pay” and a waiver on this basis “is consistent \nwith the status or benefit sought.” 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c)(1). \n21.  Under 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(d), the USCIS director can permit additional fee waivers or \nexemptions. \nUSCIS’s Fee-Waiver Practice, 2011-2019  \n \n22.  In  2011,  USCIS  released  a  memorandum  (2011  Memorandum)  amending  its \nAdjudicator’s Field Manual and titled “Fee Waiver Guidelines as Established by the Final Rule of \nthe USCIS Fee Schedule; Revisions to Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) Chapter 10.9, AFM \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 6 of 26\nUpdate  AD11-26,”  https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2011/\nMarch/FeeWaiverGuidelines_Established_by_the_Final%20Rule_USCISFeeSchedule.pdf.  \n23.  The 2011 Memorandum stated that USCIS would generally review fee waiver \nrequests under 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c) “by considering, in a step-wise fashion,” whether the individual \nfell into one of three categories. 2011 Memorandum at 2. First, USCIS would consider whether \nthe individual was receiving a means-tested benefit: a benefit such as Medicaid or Supplemental \nSecurity Income for which eligibility, the amount, or both “are determined on the basis of the \nperson’s income and resources.” Id. at 5. Second, USCIS would consider whether household \nincome was at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. Id. at 6. Third, USCIS would \nconsider whether the individual was suffering financial hardship “that renders the individual \nunable to pay the fee.” Id. at 7.  \n24.  The three-part framework set forth in the 2011 Memorandum was reflected in form \nI-912, which individuals could use to request fee waivers under 8 C.F.R. § 107.3(c). But, USCIS \ndid not require fee-waiver applicants to submit the I-912 form. Also, USCIS did not require \napplicants seeking fee waivers based on their income or hardship to obtain and submit documents \nfrom the IRS or provide any other specific form of documentation. \n25.  Under this 2011 framework, the first category—receipt of means-tested benefits—\nwas the most common way for individuals to establish their eligibility for USCIS fee waivers. The \nsecond category—the income standard—was also used, but far less frequently. Individuals rarely \nreceived fee waivers with eligibility based on the third category—financial hardship.  \n26.  For instance, a 2017 USCIS study showed that among granted fee-waiver requests, \n71.9 percent relied on means-tested benefits to establish eligibility and 26.9 percent were based on \nincome, leaving less than two percent that established eligibility based on financial hardship.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 7 of 26\n27.  In NWIRP’s experience, submitting a fee-waiver application based on receipt of a \nmeans-tested benefit was the easiest and most reliable way to seek a fee waiver under the 2011 \nMemorandum. Both completion of the application and USCIS’s adjudication of the request tended \nto be quick. Further, USCIS reliably granted fee-waiver applications accompanied by proof of \nmeans-tested benefits.  \n28.  By contrast, in NWIRP’s experience, fee-waiver applications based on individuals’ \nincome or financial hardship often took longer to prepare, required more time for USCIS to \nadjudicate, or involved a higher risk of denial, including because the hardship standard is vague \nand applicants were often left in the position of proving a negative—the absence of financial \nresources to afford the fees.  \n29.  The amount of time it takes for an individual to prepare, and for USCIS to \nadjudicate, a fee-waiver application can be critical for individuals seeking access to immigration \nbenefits because when USCIS denies a fee-waiver request, it returns the applicant’s underlying \npetition or application. Although the individual may resubmit the petition or application, USCIS \nconsiders the filing date to be the date of the resubmission, not the date of the original submission. \nThus, if USCIS rejects an individual’s fee-waiver request, that action can make the applicant miss \nany  filing  deadline  that  arose  while  the  fee-waiver  request—with  the  underlying  benefits \napplication—was pending. Even if the applicant re-submits the benefit request with payment, it \ncould be considered untimely. \nUSCIS’s Process for Changing the Fee Waiver Standard \n30.  In October 2019, USCIS changed the I-912 form and the form’s instructions, set \nthe 2011 Memorandum to expire, and added new sections to its Policy Manual.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 8 of 26\n31.  Collectively, these changes significantly narrow USCIS’s principal fee-waiver \neligibility standard. They restrict eligibility to (1) individuals with household income at or below \n150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or (2) individuals suffering financial hardship. \nFurther, they limit eligibility to those who show their income or hardship with specified types of \ndocuments.  Under  the  new  system,  receipt  of  a  means-tested  benefits  cannot  establish  an \nindividual’s eligibility for a fee waiver; an individual receiving such benefits and earning just over \n150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines may receive a fee-waiver only after establishing \nfinancial hardship using required documentation. \n32.  Rather than promulgating a rule change, USCIS purported to adopt the new I-912 \nform and instructions under the PRA, a statutory scheme that provides for Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB) approval of agency-required collections of information. \nA.  First Paperwork Reduction Act Notice \n33.  On September 28, 2018, USCIS published in the Federal Register its first PRA \ninformation-collection notice indicating that it proposed to change the I-912 form and rescind the \n2011 Memorandum. See 83 Fed. Reg. 49,120 (Sept. 28, 2018). \n34.  The September 2018 notice stated that “[t]he proposed revision would reduce the \nevidence required for Form I-912,” by “no longer requir[ing] proof of whether or not an individual \nreceives a means-tested benefit.” Id. at 49,121. \n35.  The September 2018 notice additionally stated that “USCIS has found that the \nvarious income levels used in states to grant a means-tested benefit result in inconsistent income \nlevels being used to determine eligibility for a fee waiver,” and that “[t]herefore, the revised form \nwill not permit a fee waiver based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, but will retain the poverty-\nguideline threshold and financial hardship criteria.” Id. \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 9 of 26\n36.  The September 2018 notice did not provide any other information to support or \nexplain its assertion about states’ benefits practices, did not discuss any other proposed changes to \nthe I-912 form or its instructions, and did not discuss alternative ways to address the purported \nconcern it raised. \n37.  After publishing the September 2018 notice, USCIS posted materials online that \nshowed specific proposed changes to the I-912 form and its instructions. Those materials made \nclear that USCIS was not proposing to reduce the evidence required to apply for a fee waiver. \nInstead, USCIS sought to make the standard for qualifying for a fee waiver stricter and more \ndemanding. Principally, the proposed changes would: \na.  Eliminate individuals’ ability to qualify for fee waivers based on their receipt of \nmeans-tested benefits.  \nb.  Require that individuals seeking to qualify for fee-waivers based on their income \nor financial hardship submit certain specified documentation, including, in many \ncases, tax transcripts or other documentation that individuals would have to obtain \nfrom the IRS.  \nc.  Require individuals to submit fee waiver requests on the I-912 form and to do so \nindividually, rather than combining family members’ submissions into one. \n38.  USCIS received 1,198 comments in response to its September 2018 notice.  \nB. Second Paperwork Reduction Act Notice \n39.  On  April  5,  2019,  USCIS  published  in  the  Federal  Register  a  second  PRA \ninformation-collection notice regarding its proposal to change the I-912 form and rescind the 2011 \nMemorandum. See 84 Fed. Reg. 13,687 (Apr. 5, 2019). \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 10 of 26\n40.  Similarly to  the September 2018 notice, the April 2019 notice described the \nproposed changes as ones that “would reduce the evidence required for a fee waiver” and stated \nthat the agency “found that the various income levels used in states to grant a means-tested benefit \nresult in inconsistent income levels being used to determine eligibility for a fee waiver.” Id. \n41.  The April 2019 notice did not provide any information to support or explain its \nassertion about states’ benefits practices, did not discuss any other proposed changes to the I-912 \nform or its instructions, and did not discuss alternative ways to address the purported concern it \nraised. \n42.  With the April 2019 notice, USCIS again posted materials online showing the \ndetails of its proposed revisions. The agency’s April 2019 proposal was similar to its September \n2018 proposal, but some aspects were changed. \n43.  USCIS also posted a document styled as a summary of and response to comments \nregarding the September 2018 notice. \n44.  OMB and USCIS received 1,240 comments in response to the April 2019 notice.  \nC. Third Paperwork Reduction Act Notice \n45.  On June 5, 2019, USCIS published in the Federal Register a third PRA information-\ncollection notice indicating it proposed to change the I-912 form, rescind the 2011 Memorandum, \nand issue new guidance. See 84 Fed. Reg. 26,137 (June 5, 2019). \n46.  Unlike the prior notices, the June 2019 notice described the proposed I-912 changes \nas  “removing  the  means-tested  benefit  as  a  criterion  in  [the  agency’s]  fee  waiver  request \ndeterminations, requiring the submission of Form I-912 to request a fee waiver, and clarifying \nwhat the evidentiary [sic] that will be considered for a fee waiver.” Id. at 26,138.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 11 of 26\n47.  The June 2019 notice also provided a new reason for the proposed I-912 changes: \nlimiting the number of fees waived. The notice stated: “USCIS has determined that without \nchanges to fee waiver policy it will continue to forgo increasing amounts of revenue as more fees \nare waived. As a result, USCIS expects that DHS will be required to increase the fees that it charges \nfor benefit requests for which fees are not waived.” Id. It went on to state that: “In addition to \ncurtailing the rising costs of fee waivers, this proposed policy change is intended to introduce more \nconsistent criteria for approving all fee waivers. USCIS has found that the various income levels \nused in states to grant a means-tested benefit result in inconsistent income levels being used to \ndetermine eligibility for a fee waiver.” Id. at 26,139. \n48.  The June 2019 notice did not include any data or analysis to support or explain its \nassertion about USCIS fees and revenues, did not describe any proposed changes to the I-912 form \nother than the elimination of the means-tested benefit application-category, and did not discuss \nalternative ways to address the purported concerns it raised.  \n49.  The agency again posted materials online showing its proposed revisions. Those \nmaterials did not reflect substantive changes from those posted in April 2019. \n50.  OMB and USCIS received 617 comments in response to the April 2019 notice.  \nD. Submission to OMB and OMB Approval \n51.  On October 16, 2019, USCIS submitted proposed changes to its I-912 form and \ninstructions  to  OMB  for  approval  under  the  PRA  as  revisions  to  the  agency’s  fee-waiver \ninformation-collection. \n52.  USCIS’s submission to OMB included documents styled as responses to the public \ncomments received in response to the Federal Register notices and a “Supporting Statement” that \nincluded estimates of the information-collection burden and other OMB-required information. \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 12 of 26\n53.  USCIS’s  submission  to  OMB  also  included  a  certification  that  the  revised \ninformation collection satisfied certain PRA requirements.  \n54.  On October 24, 2019, OMB approved the proposed changes, despite concluding \nthat USCIS had failed to comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, Pub. Law No. \n105-277, div. C, tit. XVII, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-749 (1998). \n55.  On October 25, 2019, USCIS finalized its new fee-waiver standard.  \na.  It adopted and published the new I-912 form and instructions, which are very \nsimilar to those that USCIS published in connection with the June 2019 Federal \nRegister notice. \nb.  It released new sections in volume 1, part B of its online Policy Manual, which had \nnot been submitted to OMB: chapter 3, regarding fees, and chapter 4, regarding fee \nwaivers.  \nc.  It announced that on December 2, 2019, the new Policy Manual chapters would be \neffective and the October 2019 I-912 form would be required; similarly, USCIS \nwould  cease  applying  the  2011  Memorandum  to  fee-waiver  applications \npostmarked on or after that date. \nThe 2019 Fee-Waiver Standard \n56.  As revised in October 2019, the I-912 form and instructions establish a new, stricter \nstandard for individuals to be eligible for fee waivers.  \n57.  First, to establish eligibility, each applicant must show household earnings at or \nbelow 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or financial hardship. Receipt of a means-\ntested benefit cannot establish eligibility, even if such benefit was based on an income standard \nthat  is  consistent  with  the  fee-waiver  standard  and  even  though  receiving  such  a  benefit \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 13 of 26\ndemonstrates that a government agency has already determined that the individual has limited \nfinancial means. \n58.  Second, to establish eligibility based on income or hardship, individuals must \nobtain and submit certain types of required documentation.  \na.  In most circumstances, individuals applying based on their household income must \nobtain  from  the  IRS  and  submit  tax  transcripts  or  other  IRS  documentation \nregarding themselves and their household members. If individuals do not have \nincome or are unable to provide proof of income, they must submit “documentation \nfrom the IRS that indicates no tax transcripts and no W-2s were found,” as well as \na description “in detail” of their situations. If household members paid taxes to \nforeign countries or U.S. territories, individuals may be required to obtain and \nsubmit tax transcripts from the relevant foreign countries or U.S. territories. USCIS, \nRequest for a Fee Waiver, Form I-912 Instructions, at 6 (Oct. 24, 2019). \nb.  Individuals that have or are applying for VAWA benefits or T or U visas can submit \nthe revised I-912 form without certain required documentation, but only if they lack \nincome or proof of income “due to [their] victimization,” substantiate both their \ninability to pay and their inability to obtain documents, and “provide any available \ndocumentation  of  …  income,  such  as  pay  stubs  or  affidavits  from  religious \ninstitutions, non-profits, or other community-based organizations verifying that \n[they] are currently receiving some benefit or support from that entity and attesting \nto [the applicants’] financial situation.” Id. at 8, 9. \nc.  In general, applicants cannot satisfy the revised standards by submitting state or \nfederal agencies’ benefit determinations or copies of filed tax forms.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 14 of 26\n59.  Third, under the revised standard, each applicant must complete the I-912 form, \nindividually, to apply for a fee waiver. \n60.  Fourth, the new standard requires other new information from applicants, including \nanswers to questions about whether they and their family members filed tax returns and if not, why \nnot.  \n61.  The  October  2019  Policy  Manual  revisions  include  additional  material.  For \nexample, they address scenarios, such as applications from children in foster care, that the revised \nI-912 form and instructions do not describe. \n62.  The new Policy Manual chapter 4 states an interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), \nthe provision requiring DHS to permit fee-waiver applications for “any fees associated with filing \nan  application  for  [certain  types  of  humanitarian]  relief  through  final  adjudication  of  the \nadjustment of status.” Without reference to the existing fee-waiver regulation, the chapter states \nthat USCIS interprets this mandate “to mean that, in addition to the primary benefit request, an \napplicant who files any form that may be filed with the primary benefit request or the adjustment \nof status application must be provided the opportunity to file a fee waiver.” USCIS, Policy Manual, \nChapter 4-Fee Waivers (2019), https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-1-part-b-chapter-4. \nUSCIS’s Attempts to Justify Its Narrowed Fee-Waiver Standard \n63.  In  its  Federal  Register  notices,  USCIS  asserted  shifting  and  incomplete \njustifications for changing the I-912 form and its instructions and rescinding the 2011 Policy \nMemorandum.  \n64.  In material submitted to OMB, USCIS asserted other reasons for the changes. For \nexample, USCIS suggested that it should not allow applications based on means-tested benefits \nbecause: \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 15 of 26\na.  Commenters’ strong opposition to the proposed changes, growth in the economy \nand incomes, growth in fee waivers, and a decrease in unemployment together \nindicate that “means tested benefits are too easy to obtain for them to be good \nindicators  of  true  inability  to  pay  a  USCIS  fee.”  USCIS,  All  Comments  & \nResponses,  84FR13687  (at  row  71),  available  at  https://www.reginfo.gov/\npublic/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201910-1615-006. \nb.  The dollar-value of fee waivers granted has increased during an economic growth \ncycle; and in an entirely distinct rulemaking, another federal agency is attempting \nto cut back on states’ flexibility to raise the income or asset limits for applying for \nfood assistance. \nc.  Applicants should not have to pay higher fees in order to help others “with incomes \nconsiderably above the poverty level” and without “financial hardship” apply for \nimmigration benefits without paying filing fees. Id. at row 13. \nd.  Fee waivers have grown more quickly than the number of individuals receiving \nbenefits.  \n65.  Some  or  all  of  the  asserted  justifications  and  explanations  are  illogical, \nunsupported, or inconsistent with the changes that USCIS made to the fee-waiver standard. \n66.  USCIS failed to address or respond meaningfully to relevant and significant issues \nraised in comment letters, such as the potentially severe consequences of delaying or forgoing \napplications for immigration benefits due to filing fees or the challenges of obtaining fee-waiver \ndocumentation on a timely basis; the importance of an easily-applied standard, such as receipt of \nmeans-tested benefits; and the impact of the proposed changes on individuals’ ability to seek and \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 16 of 26\nreceive low-cost legal assistance from organizations that had relied on the 2011 Memorandum in \ndeveloping models to serve clients effectively. \n67.  USCIS rejected, without any supporting data or analysis, commenters’ explanations \nof the extensive burdens the revised I-912 form and its instructions would impose on certain \napplicants. \n68.  USCIS responded to other comments with explanations that ignored or contradicted \ndata; contradicted existing law; were internally inconsistent; lacked supporting data; depended on \nassumptions about areas outside of USCIS’s expertise; or relied on misrepresentations of the \nrevised I-912 form, its instructions, or the 2011 Memorandum. For instance: \na.  USCIS stated that it “disagrees” with a commenter’s assertion that the new standard \n“severely limits fee waiver eligibility,” but elsewhere estimated that the standard \nwill drastically reduce the number of fee waiver applications and asserted that \nchanges are necessary precisely to reduce the number of waivers granted. Id. at \nrow 8. \nb.  USCIS suggested that the required documentation of income is the same as what \nindividuals  would  submit  to  receive  means-tested  benefits,  but  elsewhere \nrecognized that this is not the case. \nc.  USCIS stated that T- and U-visa applicants and VAWA self-petitioners do not have \nto provide otherwise-required documentation if requesting it “would trigger further \nabuse  or  endanger”  the  applicant—an  allowance  that  the  I-912  form  and \ninstructions, as revised, do not state. Id. at row 97. \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 17 of 26\n69.  In its submission to OMB, USCIS responded to some of the points identified \nwithout addressing the stated concerns, without explaining whether circumstances or USCIS’s \nposition had changed, or by rejecting, in conclusory ways, more measured alternatives. \n70.  In its Supporting Statement, USCIS responded to OMB questions in conclusory or \nincomplete fashion and provided burden estimates that lacked supporting analysis and contradicted \nthe record. For example, the Supporting Statement: \na.  Asserted burden-related estimates without supporting data or analysis.  \nb.  Ignored record evidence about the burdens associated with applying for a fee-\nwaiver, including the agency’s own recognition that applicants could incur costs to \nobtain required documentation from the IRS or translate forms into languages they \ncan understand. \nc.  Included only a conclusory statement to show that USCIS had satisfied a PRA \nrequirement  that  certain  characteristics  of  the  collection,  if  present,  meet  a \n“substantial need” or statutory requirement, 5 C.F.R. § 1320.5(d)(2). \n71.  USCIS’s certification that the revised I-912 form and instructions comply with \nPRA requirements was not supported by the record.  \n72.  The certification represented that the fee-waiver information-collection, as revised, \n“[i]s necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including [because] the \ninformation … collected will have practical utility”; “[r]educes to the extent practicable and \nappropriate the burden on persons who shall provide information to or for the agency”; “[i]s written \nusing plain, coherent, and unambiguous terminology and is understandable to those who are to \nrespond”; “[i]s to be implemented in ways consistent and compatible, to the maximum extent \npracticable, with the existing reporting and recordkeeping practices of those who are to respond”; \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 18 of 26\nand satisfies other requirements. 5 C.F.R. § 1320.9; see also 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(3); 5 C.F.R. \n§ 1320.5(a)(1)(iii)(A).  \n73.  The revised I-912 form and instructions do not match the certification. For instance:  \na.  The new form requires information and documentation that OMB did not show is \nnecessary, such as an explanation of why any applicant or any member of an \napplicant’s household did not file taxes the prior year. \nb.  The revisions serve only to increase burden on respondents, and the agency failed \nto consider obvious, less burdensome alternatives. \nc.  The record suggests that the revised form and its instructions could increase the \nagency’s  burden  for  processing  individual  fee-waiver  requests,  and  USCIS’ \nconclusory statements to the contrary were not backed by data. \nd.  The revised form and its instructions use complex and ambiguous terms and \nphrases,  such  as  “hardship”  and  “due  to  [their]  victimization,”  to  describe \nrequirements.  \ne.  The revisions generally eliminate individuals’ ability to apply for fee waivers based \non means-tested benefits documentation or tax documentation they already have, \nand instead require documentation that is not compatible with the types of records \nthat applicants may already have or be required to provide. \n74.  In other ways as well, USCIS’s submission to OMB made clear that USCIS lacked \ndata to support its reasoning or to suggest that the changes would have their desired effect. For \ninstance: \na.  The  submission  showed  that  USCIS  finalized  the  revised  I-912  form  and \ninstructions without evaluating their fiscal impact on USCIS, despite asserting that \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 19 of 26\nthe agency needed to change the fee-waiver standard in order to avoid fee increases, \nand stating that budgetary considerations overrode concerns about the burden \nimposed by the revised form. \nb.  USCIS stated that it is “confident” IRS can handle the increased workload that the \nnew I-912 form and its instructions  will generate, without any apparent data \nregarding the IRS’s capabilities. USCIS, All Comments & Responses, 84FR13687, \n(at row 59), available at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?\nref_nbr=201910-1615-006. Further, USCIS’s external consultations regarding the \nrevisions to its fee-waiver information-collection did not involve consultation with \nthe IRS.  \nc.  USCIS dismissed concerns that the new standard will increase its own workload \nand backlog, but provided no supporting data and did not suggest that the agency \nhad planned for how it will handle applications under the revised standard. \nThe Impact of USCIS’s Revised Fee-Waiver Standard on NWIRP \n75.  Many of NWIRP’s clients seek waivers of USCIS filing fees. When NWIRP helps \nclients  apply  for  USCIS  benefits,  it  also  assists  those  clients  with  associated  fee-waiver \napplications. \n76.  Before  USCIS’s  October  2019  changes  to  the  fee-waiver  standard,  NWIRP \nroutinely prepared fee-waiver applications based on clients’ receipt of means-tested benefits. In \nthese cases, NWIRP would advise a client receiving such benefits to bring documentation to his \nor her appointment. NWIRP staff could use this documentation to prepare a fee-waiver application \nin a matter of minutes. \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 20 of 26\n77.  NWIRP also routinely prepared successful fee-waiver applications without the \ndocumentation required by the October 2019 I-912 form, even for clients who were not receiving \nmeans-tested benefits. \n78.  Further, before USCIS adopted the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and \ninstructions, set a date for the 2011 Memorandum to expire, and revised its Policy Manual, NWIRP \nsubmitted some fee-waiver applications without the I-912 form and in other cases, combined the \nfee-waiver applications for multiple members of the same family into one.  \n79.  By increasing documentation requirements, eliminating the most straightforward \nof the 2011 Memorandum’s application criteria, and creating additional uncertainty about how an \napplicant can successfully establish eligibility for a fee waiver, the October 2019 I-912 form and \nits instructions, the expiration of the 2011 Memorandum, and the new Policy Manual sections will \nmake applying for fee waivers a more time-consuming and uncertain process. \n80.  The October 2019 I-912 form and its instructions, the expiration of the 2011 \nMemorandum, and the new Policy Manual sections thus impair NWIRP’s ability to assist clients \nwith immigration legal  matters and implement other programs, and conflict with NWIRP’s \nmission. In multiple ways, NWIRP will devote scarce resources to counteracting the harmful \neffects of these agency actions.  \n81.  For instance, the October 2019 I-912 form and its instructions, the expiration of the \n2011 Memorandum, and the new Policy Manual sections will cause NWIRP to spend more time, \nper individual, assisting clients with fee waivers.  \na.  NWIRP will have to spend substantially more time working with many of its fee-\nwaiver  clients  to  gather  and  review  additional  documentation.  For  example, \nNWIRP expects that collecting documents from the IRS could be particularly \n20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 21 of 26\nchallenging with its disabled or elderly clients or others who are likely to lack \naccess to the Internet, accounts in their name, or other requirements for obtaining \ndocuments from the IRS online.  \nb.  NWIRP will spend more time assessing fee-waiver clients’ tax situations due to the \nI-912 form’s new questions about tax filing. \nc.  NWIRP will also spend extra time counseling clients about fee waivers because of \nthe additional uncertainty about how to establish eligibility for a fee waiver, \nwhether individuals will need to resubmit fee-waiver applications with additional \ndocuments, and the timeline needed for achieving a favorable result.  \n82.  Increasing the time required to assist clients with fee-waiver applications and \ncounsel clients on fee-waiver issues will mean that NWIRP must divert resources from serving \nother clients. As a result, NWIRP will not able to serve as many clients as it could previously.  \n83.  NWIRP also will divert resources to address the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 \nform and its instructions, the expiration of the 2011 Memorandum, and the new Policy Manual \nsections by advancing the application fees of certain clients who are facing urgent immigration \ndeadlines, who are unable to proceed with their USCIS applications if they must pay application \nfees, and for whom NWIRP is now less certain whether USCIS will grant a fee waiver in time, \ndue to the extra time required to compile an application under the revised fee-waiver standard, the \nuncertainty regarding USCIS’s timeline for processing applications under the new standard, and \nthe lack of clarity about what applicants must do to satisfy the new standard.  \n84.  NWIRP will additionally address the harm caused by the October 2019 revisions \nto the I-912 form and its instructions, the expiration of the 2011 Memorandum, and the new Policy \nManual sections by devoting time to modifying its community-education and training materials. \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 22 of 26\nNWIRP will need to adjust its materials not only describe the new agency actions and their \nimportance, but also, in the future, to address complications that arise in the agency’s application \nof them.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Failure to observe required procedure—Rulemaking) \n85.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency actions \ntaken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n86.  The October 2019 changes to the I-912 form and its instructions constitute a \nsubstantive and legislative rule that was subject to the notice-and-comment requirements of the \nAPA, 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n87.  USCIS did not conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking before changing the I-912 \nform and its instructions. \n88.  By  failing  to  engage  in  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  before  adopting  the \nOctober 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions, USCIS failed to observe procedures \nrequired by law, in contravention of the APA. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nor not in accordance with law—Revisions to I-912 form and instructions)  \n \n89.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n90.  USCIS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the October 2019 revisions to \nthe I-912 form and instructions. It has provided shifting, incomplete, and illogical explanations of \nthe changes; asserted justifications that are unsupported by data, internally inconsistent, or in \ncontradiction of the record or the law; made assertions about matters outside its expertise; provided \n22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 23 of 26\na certification to OMB that is not supported by the record; and failed to rationally connect the \nchoices made to facts found. \n91.  In issuing the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and instructions, USCIS \nrelied on factors unrelated to individuals’ ability to pay required fees, and failed to consider \nimportant aspects of the problem. \n92.  USCIS  did  not  identify  the  facts  and  circumstances  underlying  the  2011 \nMemorandum or explain whether or why it disregarded them. \n93.  USCIS’s I-912 form and its instructions omit directions that USCIS identified \nseparately, in its Policy Manual, and did not explain. \n94.  USCIS failed to consider significant and obvious alternatives to the October 2019 \nrevisions to the I-912 form and instructions. \n95.  The October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion, in contravention of the APA.  \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nor not in accordance with law—Expiration of 2011 Memorandum) \n \n96.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n97.  USCIS provided no reasons for setting the 2011 Memorandum to expire, other than \nthose offered to justify the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions. Those \nreasons are incomplete, unsupported, and otherwise inadequate, as described above. \n98.  USCIS’s  establishment  of  an  expiration  date  for  the  2011  Memorandum  is \narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, in contravention of the APA. \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 24 of 26\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nor not in accordance with law—Policy Manual revisions) \n \n99.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n100.  USCIS provided no reasons to issue new sections of its Policy Manual, other than \nthose offered to justify the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions. Those \nreasons are incomplete, unsupported, and otherwise inadequate, as described above. \n101.  The Policy Manual’s new chapter 4 incorrectly and unreasonably interprets 8 \nU.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), to the extent that such interpretation attempts to narrow individuals’ ability to \nseek fee waivers for filings that are not made with a primary benefit request but that are made \nbefore final adjudication of an individual’s adjustment of status. \n102.  USCIS’s new Policy Manual sections, regarding fees and fee waivers, are arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, in contravention of the \nAPA. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nnot in accordance with the law, or taken without  \nobservance of required procedure—Information collection revisions) \n \n103.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), or taken “without observance of procedure required by law,” id. § 706(2)(D). \n104.  USCIS did not comply with the PRA requirement that, before revising its fee-\nwaiver information collection, it first complete a multi-factor review that included an “objectively \nsupported estimate of burden,” 5 C.F.R. § 1320.8(a)(4); “[a] plan for the efficient and effective \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 25 of 26\nmanagement and use of the information to be collected, including necessary resources,” id. \n§ 1320.8(a)(7); and other elements, id. § 1320.8(a). See generally id. § 1320.5(a)(1)(i).  \n105.  Because  they  were  inaccurate  and  incomplete,  the  agency’s  Federal  Register \nnotices did not satisfy the PRA requirement for USCIS to publish two Federal Register notices \nbefore  revising  its  fee-waiver  information-collection.  See  44  U.S.C.  §§ 3506(c)(2)(A), \n3507(a)(1)(D); 5 C.F.R. §§ 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), 1320.8(d)(1), 1320.10(a). \n106.  USCIS did not comply with the PRA requirement that, to obtain OMB approval for \nthe October 2019 revisions to its fee-waiver information collection, it “demonstrate that it has \ntaken every reasonable step to ensure that the proposed collection of information” “[i]s the least \nburdensome necessary,” “[h]as practical utility,” has not “shift[ed] disproportionate costs or \nburdens onto the public” in “seek[ing] to minimize the cost to [USCIS],” and meets other \nstandards,  id.  § 1320.5(d)(1),  as  well  as  demonstrate  in  its  OMB  submission  that  certain \ncharacteristics of the collection, if present, satisfy a “substantial need” or a statutory requirement, \nid. § 1320.5(d)(2).  \n107.  USCIS  failed  to  satisfy  the  PRA  requirement  that  it  provide  a  certification, \nsupported by the record, that its fee-waiver information-collection, as revised, satisfies certain \nrequirements.  See  5  C.F.R.  §  1320.9;  see  also  44  U.S.C.  § 3506(c)(3);  5  C.F.R. \n§ 1320.5(a)(1)(iii)(A).  \n108.  In adopting the October 2019 revisions to its fee-waiver information-collection, \nUSCIS failed to observe procedures required by law, or took agency action that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the PRA, in contravention of the APA. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court: \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 1   Filed 10/31/19   Page 26 of 26\nA.

This suit challenges a series of actions by the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) that make it significantly more difficult and expensive for immigrants to apply for vital \nimmigration benefits: naturalization, employment authorization, asylum, and others. In October \n2019, DHS component United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) purported to \nnarrow the ways in which individuals can qualify for waivers of USCIS’s substantial application \nfees. Then, in August 2020, DHS issued a new rule that would codify many of the changes that \nUSCIS had sought to make without rulemaking. DHS’s rule also took USCIS’s approach further. \nIt eliminated fee waivers for all but a few narrow categories of immigrants. To make more \nindividuals pay immigration fees, DHS created new charges, including a fee to apply for asylum. \nDHS also raised existing fees, in some cases, by more than 500 percent. Under DHS’s new rule, \nimmigrants seeking humanitarian protections, legal authorization to work and live in the United \nStates, or citizenship will face fees that can be more than $1,000 greater than what they would \nhave to pay under current law.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 3 of 74\n2.  DHS expects that its new rule will force immigrants to pay a combined total of \nabout $1 billion in extra fees to USCIS per year, to fund operations that DHS does not explain and \nto raise money against an outdated estimated budget. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n4.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) is a nonprofit legal services \norganization founded in 1984 to defend and advance the rights of immigrants. To further its \nmission, NWIRP provides direct legal representation and consultations in immigration matters to \nthousands of low-income individuals each year. NWIRP also provides immigration-related advice \nand information through community-based know-your-rights presentations and trainings offered \nto service providers and attorneys.  \n6.  Through its direct legal services, NWIRP helps low-income individuals seeking to \napply for a range of immigration benefits, including visas, asylum, employment authorization, \nlawful permanent residence, and naturalization. It prioritizes serving individuals who are in \nvulnerable circumstances or who face complex legal issues, including those who have been \nimpacted by the criminal legal system. \n7.  NWIRP’s work includes helping survivors of domestic and sexual violence gain \naccess to humanitarian protections. Principally, NWIRP represents these individuals in filing \napplications and petitions for benefits under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a \nstatutory framework that allows survivors of domestic abuse to apply for lawful permanent \nresidence without having to rely on their abusers; T or U visas, immigration benefits that Congress \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 4 of 74\ncreated to help survivors of human trafficking or crimes; and employment authorization or lawful \npermanent residence.  \n8.  NWIRP also assists individuals who are seeking naturalization, many of whom \nhave a disability or face other circumstances that may make the naturalization process complicated. \n9.  Additionally, NWIRP represents individuals who are in immigration detention. \nAmong other things, NWIRP helps these clients apply for immigration benefits and, in removal \nproceedings, seek asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against \nTorture.  \n10.  Further,  NWIRP  helps  other  individuals  seeking  asylum;  children  and  youth \nseeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, an immigration benefit available to those who were \nabandoned, abused, or neglected by their parents; and others.  \n11.  NWIRP serves the community from four offices spread across Washington State. \nBecause of the high demand for its services, NWIRP maintains waiting lists of individuals seeking \nits services. \n12.  Plaintiff Ayuda, Inc. is a nonprofit with offices in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and \nMaryland, whose mission is to advocate for low-income immigrants through direct legal, social, \nand language services, training, and outreach. Ayuda envisions a community where all immigrants \nsucceed and thrive in the United States. Ayuda’s direct legal services include helping individuals \nseek a wide range of immigration benefits, including T visas, U visas, VAWA-related benefits, \nasylum,  adjustment  of  status  to  lawful  permanent  residence,  naturalization,  employment \nauthorizations, and replacements of permanent resident cards. Ayuda also provides clients with \nrepresentation in immigration court removal proceedings. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 5 of 74\n13.  Plaintiff CASA de Maryland, Inc. (CASA)  is  a nonprofit, membership-based \nimmigrant rights organization headquartered in Langley Park, Maryland, with offices in Maryland, \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania. Its mission is to create a more just society by building power and \nimproving the quality of life in low-income immigrant communities. To further this mission, \nCASA offers a wide variety of services to immigrant communities. These services include helping \nmembers  apply  for  citizenship  through  an  integrated  program  that  includes  naturalization \napplication assistance, financial education, civics courses, legal support, and English instruction. \nAcross its programs, a core focus of CASA’s work is helping immigrants gain the right to vote. \n14.  Defendant DHS is an agency of the federal government, whose components include \nUSCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE). DHS has authority to promulgate regulations regarding immigration law and promulgated \nthe August 3, 2020 rule at issue in this case. \n15.  Defendant  USCIS  adjudicates  applications  for  lawful  permanent  residence, \nnaturalization, employment authorization, and other immigration benefits, including asylum, SIJS, \nVAWA self-petitions, and T and U visas. Under regulation, USCIS charges filing fees for a number \nof immigration-benefit applications but allows waivers of certain such fees. \n16.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf holds the title of acting DHS secretary. \n17.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli holds the titles within DHS of senior official \nperforming the duties of the deputy secretary and senior official performing the duties of the \ndirector of USCIS.  \nBACKGROUND \n18.  Each year, immigrants submit millions of applications to USCIS for immigration \nbenefits that can transform their lives. These benefits include humanitarian benefits, such as T and \nU visas, VAWA self-petitions, asylum, and SIJS; employment authorization and lawful permanent \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 6 of 74\nresidence,  which  establish  individuals’  right  to  live  and  work  in  the  United  States;  and \nnaturalization, which enables individuals to become citizens and fully participate in American life, \nincluding by voting.  \n19.  USCIS charges significant application fees for some benefits. For example, under \nthe agency’s 2016 fee schedule, it charges $1,140 to apply to become a lawful permanent resident; \n$410 to request employment authorization; up to $455, plus an $85 biometrics fee, to replace a \npermanent resident card; and up to $640, plus an $85 biometrics fee, to apply for naturalization. \nUnder that schedule, the agency also charges $700 for an appeal in a naturalization matter, $675 \nfor an appeal on a VAWA self-petition or T or U visa, and $930 for an application for a waiver of \ninadmissibility, which often accompanies a T or U visa application.  \n20.  For low-income individuals, USCIS application fees can be an insurmountable \nobstacle to applying for benefits.  \n21.  Forgoing an immigration-benefit application because the fee is too expensive can \nlead to devastating consequences for individuals. For example, a delay in seeking humanitarian \nbenefits can mean that a survivor of domestic violence or trafficking will suffer longer at the hands \nof an abuser, without access to legal rights and protections. A delay in seeking to naturalize can \nmean missing the right to vote in upcoming elections or losing access to public benefits that depend \non recipients naturalizing by a certain date. And in multiple circumstances, missing a filing \ndeadline can mean that an individual loses the chance to receive the immigration benefit altogether. \n22.  As a result, no-fee filings, affordable fees, or fee waivers are often essential to allow \nlow-income immigrants reasonable access to vital immigration benefits.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 7 of 74\nI. IMMIGRATION FEES AND FEE WAIVERS \nA. USCIS funding sources \n23.  DHS sets USCIS application fees under the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m). That provision creates an Immigration Examination Fee Account \n(IEFA), directs that “adjudication fees as are designated by the Attorney General in regulation” be \ndeposited into the IEFA, and allows that “fees for providing adjudication and naturalization \nservices may be set at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such \nservices” and “any additional costs associated with the administration of the fees collected.” \nSection 1356(n) similarly states that IEFA funds are available “to reimburse any appropriation … \nfor expenses in providing immigration adjudication and naturalization services and the collection, \nsafeguarding and accounting for fees deposited in and funds reimbursed from” the account. \n24.  In  addition  to  receiving  standard  USCIS  application  fees,  the  IEFA  receives \npremium processing fees paid by employers, id. § 1356(u), fees paid by immigrants to the \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), and fees paid by \nindividuals seeking genealogy information, id. at § 1356(t)(1).  \n25.  USCIS  also  receives funding  from  sources other  than  IEFA, including  funds \nappropriated by Congress and employer-paid fees that are designated for fraud prevention and \ndetection and other purposes. See id. § 1356(s), (v).  \nB. Fee-Waiver Statutes and Regulation \n26.  DHS is not required to charge the full range of fees that it has set for USCIS. \nThough the INA may permit DHS to charge enough USCIS fees to recover the full cost of \nimmigration adjudication and naturalization services, the INA does not require DHS to set fees at \nthis level. The INA also recognizes that immigration services can be “provided without charge to \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 8 of 74\nasylum applicants or other immigrants,” id. § 1356(m), specifies certain fee exemptions or fee \ncaps, e.g., id. § 1439(b)(4), and requires that DHS “shall permit” individuals seeking or holding \ncertain forms of humanitarian benefits “to apply for a waiver of any fees associated with filing an \napplication for relief through final adjudication of the adjustment of status,” id. § 1255(l)(7).  \n27.  In 2010, as part of a fee-schedule revision, DHS revised its rule on fee waivers. \nUnder the principal fee-waiver provision, 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c), USCIS can waive listed fees if the \nrequester is “unable to pay” and a waiver “is consistent with the status or benefit sought.” Id. \n§ 103.7(c)(1). To apply, an individual must “submit a written request” that “state[s] the person’s \nbelief that he or she is entitled to or deserving of the benefit requested, the reasons for his or her \ninability to pay, and evidence to support the reasons indicated.” Id. § 103.7(c)(2). The regulation \npermits a wide range of applicants to seek fee waivers for a wide range of applications. \n28.  In 2016, DHS adopted another comprehensive revision to its fee schedule through \na rule that took effect on December 23, 2016. See 81 Fed. Reg. 73,292 (Oct. 24, 2016). That rule \ncreated a new, reduced fee for low-income naturalization applicants, and did not change the \nprincipal fee-waiver regulation that had been adopted in 2010.  \n29.  Through fiscal year 2020, DHS’s December 23, 2016 fee schedule remained in \nplace, except for inflation adjustments to premium processing fees and fees added by new rules. \nC. USCIS’s Fee-Waiver Practice, 2011-2019  \n \n30.  Following DHS’s 2010 revision of the fee-waiver regulation, USCIS released a \nmemorandum (2011 Memorandum) amending its Adjudicator’s Field Manual and titled “Fee \nWaiver Guidelines as Established by the Final Rule of the USCIS Fee Schedule; Revisions to \nAdjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) Chapter 10.9, AFM Update AD11-26,” https://www.uscis.gov/\n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 9 of 74\nsites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2011/March/FeeWaiverGuidelines_Established_\nby_the_Final%20Rule_USCISFeeSchedule.pdf.  \n31.  The 2011 Memorandum was binding on USCIS employees. \n32.  The 2011 Memorandum stated that “[a] fee-waiver request may be granted when \nUSCIS has determined that the individual is unable to pay the fee,” id. at 5, and explained that \nUSCIS would generally review fee waiver requests under 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c) “by considering, in \na step-wise fashion,” whether the individual fell into one of three categories. 2011 Memorandum \nat 2. First, USCIS would consider whether the individual was receiving a means-tested benefit: a \nbenefit such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income for which eligibility, the amount, or \nboth “are determined on the basis of the person’s income and resources.” Id. at 5. If so, “the fee \nwaiver [would] normally be approved.” Id. Second, USCIS would consider whether household \nincome was at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. Id. at 6. If so, “the fee waiver \n[would] normally be approved.” Id. at 7. Third, USCIS would consider whether the individual was \nsuffering financial hardship “that renders the individual unable to pay the fee.” Id. at 7.  \n33.  The 2011 Memorandum included other material, including material regarding \nhumanitarian fee waivers under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), and material regarding the processing of \nfee waiver requests. \n34.  The three-part framework set forth in the 2011 Memorandum was reflected in form \nI-912, which individuals could use to request fee waivers under 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c). But the 2011 \nMemorandum stated that “the use of a USCIS-published fee-waiver request form is not mandated \nby regulation,” 2011 Memorandum at 2, and USCIS did not require fee-waiver applicants to use \nthe I-912 form for fee-waiver requests.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 10 of 74\n35.  USCIS also did not require applicants seeking fee waivers based on their income \nor hardship to obtain and submit documents from the IRS or provide any other specific form of \ndocumentation. Additionally, USCIS permitted family members to submit one joint fee-waiver \napplication for immigration applications that included derivative family members. \n36.  Under the 2011 Memorandum’s framework, the first category—receipt of means-\ntested benefits—was the most common way for individuals to establish their eligibility for USCIS \nfee waivers. The second category—the income standard—was also used, but far less frequently. \nIndividuals rarely received fee waivers with eligibility based on the third category—financial \nhardship.  \n37.  For instance, a 2017 USCIS study showed that, among granted fee-waiver requests, \n71.9 percent relied on means-tested benefits to establish eligibility and 26.9 percent were based on \nincome, leaving less than two percent that established eligibility based on financial hardship.  \n38.  Submitting a fee-waiver application based on receipt of a means-tested benefit was \nthe easiest and most reliable way to seek a fee waiver under the 2011 Memorandum. Both \ncompletion of the application and USCIS’s adjudication of the request tended to be quick. Further, \nUSCIS reliably granted fee-waiver applications accompanied by proof of means-tested benefits.  \n39.  By contrast, fee-waiver applications based on individuals’ income or financial \nhardship often took longer to prepare, required more time for USCIS to adjudicate, or involved a \nhigher risk of denial, including because the hardship standard is vague and applicants were often \nleft in the position of proving a negative—the absence of financial resources to afford the fees.  \n40.  The amount of time it takes for an individual to prepare, and for USCIS to \nadjudicate, a fee-waiver application can be critical for individuals seeking access to immigration \nbenefits because when USCIS denies a fee-waiver request, it returns the applicant’s underlying \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 11 of 74\npetition or application. Although the individual may resubmit the petition or application, USCIS \nconsiders the filing date to be the date of the resubmission, not the date of the original submission. \nThus, if USCIS rejects an individual’s fee-waiver request, that action can make the applicant miss \nany  filing  deadline  that  arose  while  the  fee-waiver  request—with  the  underlying  benefits \napplication—was pending. Even if the applicant re-submits the benefit request with payment, it \ncould be considered untimely. \n41.  Under the 2010 fee-waiver regulation and 2011 Memorandum framework, USCIS \nwaived between 400,000 and 600,000 fees during each of the last several years. From 2017 to \n2019, the volume of fee waivers that USCIS granted decreased by about 30 percent.  \nII. 2019 ACTIONS TO NARROW FEE-WAIVER ELIGIBILITY \nA. USCIS’s Process for Changing the Fee Waiver Standard \n42.  In October 2019, USCIS changed the I-912 form and the form’s instructions, set \nthe 2011 Memorandum to expire, and added new sections to its Policy Manual.  \n43.  These  actions  (collectively,  October  2019  fee-waiver  actions)  significantly \nnarrowed  USCIS’s  principal  fee-waiver  eligibility  standard.  They  restricted  eligibility  to \n(1) individuals with documented household income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty \nguidelines or (2) individuals suffering demonstrated financial hardship. Further, they limited \neligibility to those who show their income or hardship with specified types of documents. Under \nthe new system, receipt of a means-tested benefit cannot establish an individual’s eligibility for a \nfee waiver; an individual receiving such benefits and earning just over 150 percent of the federal \npoverty  guidelines  may  receive  a  fee-waiver  only  after  establishing  financial  hardship  in \naccordance with the form I-912 instructions. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 12 of 74\n44.  Rather than promulgating a rule change using notice-and-comment rulemaking, \nUSCIS purported to adopt the new I-912 form and instructions under the Paperwork Reduction \nAct (PRA), a statutory scheme that provides for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \napproval of agency-required collections of information. \n(1) First Paperwork Reduction Act Notice \n45.  On September 28, 2018, USCIS published in the Federal Register its first PRA \ninformation-collection notice indicating that it proposed to change the I-912 form and rescind the \n2011 Memorandum. See 83 Fed. Reg. 49,120 (Sept. 28, 2018). \n46.  The September 2018 notice stated that “[t]he proposed revision would reduce the \nevidence required for Form I-912,” by “no longer requir[ing] proof of whether or not an individual \nreceives a means-tested benefit.” Id. at 49,121. \n47.  The September 2018 notice additionally stated that “USCIS has found that the \nvarious income levels used in states to grant a means-tested benefit result in inconsistent income \nlevels being used to determine eligibility for a fee waiver,” and that “[t]herefore, the revised form \nwill not permit a fee waiver based on receipt of a means-tested benefit, but will retain the poverty-\nguideline threshold and financial hardship criteria.” Id. \n48.  The September 2018 notice did not provide any other information to support or \nexplain its assertion about states’ benefits practices, did not discuss any other proposed changes to \nthe I-912 form or its instructions, and did not discuss alternative ways to address the purported \nconcern it raised. \n49.  After publishing the September 2018 notice, USCIS posted materials online that \nshowed specific proposed changes to the I-912 form and its instructions. Those materials made \nclear that USCIS was not proposing to reduce the evidence required to apply for a fee waiver. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 13 of 74\nInstead, USCIS sought to make the standard for qualifying for a fee waiver stricter and more \ndemanding. Principally, the proposed changes would: \na.  Eliminate individuals’ ability to qualify for fee waivers based on their receipt of \nmeans-tested benefits.  \nb.  Require that individuals seeking to qualify for fee-waivers based on their income \nor financial hardship submit certain specified documentation, including, in many \ncases, tax transcripts or other documentation that individuals would have to obtain \nfrom the IRS.  \nc.  Require individuals to submit fee waiver requests on the I-912 form and to do so \nindividually, rather than combining family members’ submissions into one. \n50.  USCIS received 1,198 comments in response to its September 2018 notice.  \n(2) Second Paperwork Reduction Act Notice \n51.  On  April  5,  2019,  USCIS  published  in  the  Federal  Register  a  second  PRA \ninformation-collection notice regarding its proposal to change the I-912 form and rescind the 2011 \nMemorandum. See 84 Fed. Reg. 13,687 (Apr. 5, 2019). \n52.  Similarly to the September 2018 notice, the April 2019 notice described the \nproposed changes as ones that “would reduce the evidence required for a fee waiver” and stated \nthat the agency “found that the various income levels used in states to grant a means-tested benefit \nresult in inconsistent income levels being used to determine eligibility for a fee waiver.” Id. \n53.  The April 2019 notice did not provide any information to support or explain its \nassertion about states’ benefits practices, did not discuss any other proposed changes to the I-912 \nform or its instructions, and did not discuss alternative ways to address the purported concern it \nraised. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 14 of 74\n54.  With the April 2019 notice, USCIS again posted materials online showing the \ndetails of its proposed revisions. The agency’s April 2019 proposal was similar to its September \n2018 proposal, but some aspects were changed. \n55.  USCIS also posted a document styled as a summary of and response to comments \nregarding the September 2018 notice. \n56.  OMB and USCIS received 1,240 comments in response to the April 2019 notice.  \n(3) Third Paperwork Reduction Act Notice \n57.  On June 5, 2019, USCIS published in the Federal Register a third PRA information-\ncollection  notice  indicating  that  it  proposed  to  change  the  I-912  form,  rescind  the  2011 \nMemorandum, and issue new guidance. See 84 Fed. Reg. 26,137 (June 5, 2019). \n58.  Unlike the prior notices, the June 2019 notice described the proposed I-912 changes \nas  “removing  the  means-tested  benefit  as  a  criterion  in  [the  agency’s]  fee  waiver  request \ndeterminations, requiring the submission of Form I-912 to request a fee waiver, and clarifying \nwhat the evidentiary [sic] that will be considered for a fee waiver.” Id. at 26,138.  \n59.  The June 2019 notice also provided a new reason for the proposed I-912 changes: \nlimiting the number of fees waived. The notice stated: “USCIS has determined that without \nchanges to fee waiver policy it will continue to forgo increasing amounts of revenue as more fees \nare waived. As a result, USCIS expects that DHS will be required to increase the fees that it charges \nfor benefit requests for which fees are not waived.” Id. It went on to state that: “In addition to \ncurtailing the rising costs of fee waivers, this proposed policy change is intended to introduce more \nconsistent criteria for approving all fee waivers. USCIS has found that the various income levels \nused in states to grant a means-tested benefit result in inconsistent income levels being used to \ndetermine eligibility for a fee waiver.” Id. at 26,139. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 15 of 74\n60.  The June 2019 notice did not include any data or analysis to support or explain its \nassertion about USCIS fees and revenues, did not describe any proposed changes to the I-912 form \nother than the elimination of the means-tested benefit application-category, and did not discuss \nalternative ways to address the purported concerns it raised.  \n61.  The agency again posted materials online showing its proposed revisions. Those \nmaterials did not reflect substantive changes from those posted in April 2019. \n62.  OMB and USCIS received 617 comments in response to the April 2019 notice.  \n(4) Submission to OMB and OMB Approval \n63.  On October 16, 2019, USCIS submitted to OMB the proposed changes to USCIS’s \nI-912 form and the form’s instructions, for approval under the PRA as revisions to the agency’s \nfee-waiver information-collection. \n64.  USCIS’s submission to OMB included documents styled as responses to the public \ncomments received in response to the Federal Register notices and a “Supporting Statement” that \nincluded estimates of the information-collection burden and other OMB-required information. \n65.  USCIS’s  submission  to  OMB  also  included  a  certification  that  the  revised \ninformation collection satisfied certain PRA requirements.  \n66.  On October 24, 2019, OMB approved the proposed changes, despite concluding \nthat USCIS had failed to comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, Pub. Law No. \n105-277, div. C, tit. XVII, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-749 (1998). \n67.  On October 24, 2019, USCIS adopted the new I-912 form and instructions, which \nare very similar to those that USCIS published in connection with the June 2019 Federal Register \nnotice. \n68.  On or about October 25, 2019, USCIS:  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 16 of 74\na.  Published the new I-912 form and instructions online. \nb.  Released new sections in volume 1, part B of its online Policy Manual, which had \nnot been submitted to OMB: chapter 3, regarding fees, and chapter 4, regarding fee \nwaivers, to supersede sections 10.9 and 10.10 in the Adjudicator’s Field Manual \nand related material. \nc.  Announced that on December 2, 2019, the new Policy Manual chapters would be \neffective and the October 2019 I-912 form would be required; similarly, USCIS \nwould  cease  applying  the  2011  Memorandum  to  fee-waiver  applications \npostmarked on or after that date. \nB. The 2019 Fee-Waiver Standard \n69.  As revised in October 2019, the I-912 form and instructions establish a new, stricter \nstandard for individuals to be eligible for fee waivers.  \n70.  USCIS intended the new standard to conclusively determine eligibility for fee \nwaivers under 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c). \n71.  First, to establish eligibility, each applicant must show household earnings at or \nbelow 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or financial hardship. Receipt of a means-\ntested benefit cannot establish eligibility, even if such benefit was based on an income standard \nthat  is  consistent  with  the  fee-waiver  standard  and  even  though  receiving  such  a  benefit \ndemonstrates that a government agency has already determined that the individual has limited \nfinancial means. \n72.  Second, to establish eligibility based on income or hardship, individuals must \nobtain and submit certain types of required documentation. For example: \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 17 of 74\na.  In most circumstances, individuals applying based on their household income must \nobtain  from  the  IRS  and  submit  tax  transcripts  or  other  IRS  documentation \nregarding themselves and their household members. If individuals do not have \nincome or are unable to provide proof of income, they must submit “documentation \nfrom the IRS that indicates no tax transcripts and no W-2s were found,” as well as \na description “in detail” of their situations. If household members paid taxes to \nforeign countries or U.S. territories, individuals may be required to obtain and \nsubmit tax transcripts from the relevant foreign countries or U.S. territories. USCIS, \nRequest for a Fee Waiver, Form I-912 Instructions, at 6 (Oct. 24, 2019). \nb.  Individuals that have or are applying for VAWA benefits or T or U visas can submit \nthe revised I-912 form without certain required documentation, but only if they lack \nincome or proof of income “due to [their] victimization,” substantiate both their \ninability to pay and their inability to obtain documents, and “provide any available \ndocumentation  of  …  income,  such  as  pay  stubs  or  affidavits  from  religious \ninstitutions, non-profits, or other community-based organizations verifying that \n[the applicant is] currently receiving some benefit or support from that entity and \nattesting to [the applicant’s] financial situation.” Id. at 8, 9. \nc.  In general, applicants cannot satisfy the revised standards by submitting state or \nfederal agencies’ benefit determinations or copies of filed tax forms.  \n73.  Third, under the revised standard, each applicant must complete the I-912 form, \nindividually, to apply for a fee waiver. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 18 of 74\n74.  Fourth, the new standard requires other new information from applicants, including \nanswers to questions about whether they and their family members filed tax returns and if not, why \nnot.  \n75.  Some otherwise-eligible individuals will  not be able to  apply  under the new \nstandard established by the October 2019 form because the required documentation is unavailable. \nFor example, in some circumstances, the IRS does not provide required documents, including \n“documentation … that indicates no tax transcripts or W-2s were found,” as quickly as necessary \nto meet short USCIS filing deadlines. \n76.  The October 2019 Policy Manual revisions include material in addition to the \nrequirements of the revised fee-waiver form and instructions. For example, they address scenarios, \nsuch as applications from children in foster care, that the revised I-912 form and instructions do \nnot describe. \n77.  Chapter  4  of  the  new  Policy  Manual  states  an  interpretation  of  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1255(l)(7), which requires DHS to permit fee-waiver applications for “any fees associated with \nfiling an application for relief through final adjudication of the adjustment of status for a VAWA \nself-petitioner  and  for  relief  under”  certain  enumerated  statutory  provisions.  Without  any \nexplanation, reference to the existing fee-waiver regulation, or discussion of the agency’s earlier \ninterpretation of the statute, the chapter states that USCIS interprets this mandate “to mean that, in \naddition to the primary benefit request, an applicant who files any form that may be filed with the \nprimary benefit request or the adjustment of status application must be provided the opportunity \nto file a fee waiver.” USCIS, Policy Manual, Chapter 4-Fee Waivers (2019). \n78.  USCIS’s Policy Manual is binding on USCIS officers. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 19 of 74\nC. USCIS’s Attempts to Justify Its Narrowed Fee-Waiver Standard \n79.  In  its  Federal  Register  notices,  USCIS  asserted  shifting  and  incomplete \njustifications for changing the I-912 form and its instructions and rescinding the 2011 Policy \nMemorandum.  \n80.  In material submitted to OMB, USCIS asserted other reasons for the changes. For \nexample, USCIS suggested that it should not allow applications based on means-tested benefits \nbecause: \na.  Commenters’ strong opposition to the proposed changes, growth in the economy \nand incomes, growth in fee waivers, and a decrease in unemployment together \nindicate that “means tested benefits are too easy to obtain for them to be good \nindicators  of  true  inability  to  pay  a  USCIS  fee.”  USCIS,  All  Comments  & \nResponses,  84FR13687  (at  row  71),  available  at  https://www.reginfo.gov/\npublic/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201910-1615-006. \nb.  The dollar-value of fee waivers granted has increased during an economic growth \ncycle; and in a different rulemaking, another federal agency is attempting to cut \nback on states’ flexibility to raise the income or asset limits for applying for food \nassistance. \nc.  Applicants should not have to pay higher fees in order to help others “with incomes \nconsiderably above the poverty level” and without “financial hardship” apply for \nimmigration benefits without paying filing fees. Id. at row 13. \nd.  Fee waivers have grown more quickly than the number of individuals receiving \nbenefits.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 20 of 74\n81.  USCIS did not provide data or analysis to support its justifications for the October \n2019 changes to the I-912 form and instructions. \n82.  USCIS did not consider individuals’ ability to pay USCIS application fees. \n83.  USCIS did not consider the relationship between its October 2019 fee-waiver \nactions and other regulatory initiatives, including rulemakings regarding USCIS fees and the \npublic charge determination in immigration law, as well as U.S. Department of Agriculture \nrulemakings on the standards for a means-tested benefit program. \n84.  Some or all of USCIS’s asserted justifications and explanations are illogical, \nunsupported, conclusory, or inconsistent with the changes that USCIS made to the fee-waiver \nstandard. \n85.  USCIS failed to address or respond meaningfully to relevant and significant issues \nraised in comment letters, such as the burden that the new standard will impose on applicants, \nUSCIS, and the IRS; the potentially severe consequences of delaying or forgoing applications for \nimmigration benefits due to filing fees or the challenges of obtaining fee-waiver documentation \non a timely basis; the importance of an easily-applied standard, such as receipt of means-tested \nbenefits; and the impact of the proposed changes on individuals’ ability to seek and receive low-\ncost legal assistance from organizations that had relied on the 2011 Memorandum in developing \nmodels to serve clients effectively. \n86.  USCIS ignored, rejected, or addressed only in conclusory fashion, without any \nsupporting data or analysis, commenters’ explanations of the extensive burdens and harms the \nrevised I-912 form and its instructions would impose on certain applicants. \n87.  USCIS responded to some comments with explanations that ignored or contradicted \ndata; contradicted existing law; were internally inconsistent; lacked supporting data; depended on \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 21 of 74\nassumptions about areas outside of USCIS’s expertise; or relied on misrepresentations of the \nrevised I-912 form, its instructions, or the 2011 Memorandum. For instance: \na.  USCIS stated that it “disagrees” with a commenter’s assertion that the new standard \n“severely limits fee waiver eligibility,” All Comments & Responses, 84FR13687 (at \nrow 8), but elsewhere estimated that the standard will drastically reduce the number \nof fee waiver applications and asserted that changes are necessary precisely to \nreduce the number of waivers granted.  \nb.  USCIS suggested that the required documentation of income is the same as what \nindividuals would submit to receive means-tested benefits, but ignored evidence to \nthe contrary and elsewhere stated that USCIS and other agencies’ determinations \nare “distinct.” Id. at row 12. \nc.  USCIS stated that T- and U-visa applicants and VAWA self-petitioners do not have \nto provide otherwise-required documentation if requesting it “would trigger further \nabuse or endanger” the applicant—an allowance that the October 2019 I-912 form \nand instructions do not state. Id. at row 97. \n88.  In its submission to OMB, USCIS responded to some of the points identified \nwithout addressing the stated concerns, without explaining whether circumstances or USCIS’s \nposition had changed, or by rejecting, in conclusory ways, more measured alternatives. \n89.  In its Supporting Statement, USCIS responded to OMB questions in conclusory or \nincomplete fashion and provided burden estimates that lacked supporting analysis and contradicted \nthe record. For example, the Supporting Statement: \na.  Asserted burden-related estimates without supporting data or analysis.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 22 of 74\nb.  Ignored record evidence about the burdens associated with applying for a fee-\nwaiver, including the agency’s own recognition that applicants could incur costs to \nobtain required documentation from the IRS or translate forms into languages they \ncan understand. \nc.  Included only a conclusory statement to show that USCIS had satisfied a PRA \nrequirement  that  certain  characteristics  of  the  collection,  if  present,  meet  a \n“substantial need” or statutory requirement, 5 C.F.R. § 1320.5(d)(2). \n90.  USCIS’s certification that the revised I-912 form and instructions comply with \nPRA requirements was not supported by the record.  \n91.  The certification represented that the fee-waiver information-collection, as revised, \n“[i]s necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including [because] the \ninformation … collected will have practical utility”; “[r]educes to the extent practicable and \nappropriate the burden on persons who shall provide information to or for the agency”; “[i]s written \nusing plain, coherent, and unambiguous terminology and is understandable to those who are to \nrespond”; “[i]s to be implemented in ways consistent and compatible, to the maximum extent \npracticable, with the existing reporting and recordkeeping practices of those who are to respond”; \nand satisfies other requirements. 5 C.F.R. § 1320.9; see also 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(3); 5 C.F.R. \n§ 1320.5(a)(1)(iii)(A).  \n92.  The revised I-912 form and instructions do not match the certification. For instance:  \na.  The new form requires information and documentation that USCIS did not show is \nnecessary, such as an explanation of why any applicant or any member of an \napplicant’s household did not file taxes the prior year. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 23 of 74\nb.  The revisions serve only to increase burden on fee-waiver applicants, and the \nagency failed to consider obvious, less burdensome alternatives. \nc.  The record suggests that the revised form and its instructions could increase the \nagency’s  burden  for  processing  individual  fee-waiver  requests,  and  USCIS’s \nconclusory statements to the contrary were not backed by data. \nd.  The revised form and its instructions use complex and ambiguous terms and \nphrases,  such  as  “hardship”  and  “due  to  [their]  victimization,”  to  describe \nrequirements.  \ne.  The revisions generally eliminate individuals’ ability to apply for fee waivers based \non means-tested benefits documentation or tax documentation they already have, \nand instead require documentation that is not compatible with the types of records \nthat applicants may already have or be required to provide. \n93.  In other ways as well, USCIS’s submission to OMB made clear that USCIS lacked \ndata to support its reasoning or to suggest that the changes would have their desired effect. For \ninstance: \na.  The  submission  showed  that  USCIS  finalized  the  revised  I-912  form  and \ninstructions without evaluating their fiscal impact on USCIS, despite asserting that \nthe agency needed to change the fee-waiver standard in order to avoid fee increases, \nand stating that budgetary considerations overrode concerns about the burden \nimposed by the revised form. \nb.  USCIS stated that it is “confident” the IRS can handle the increased workload that \nthe new I-912 form and its instructions will generate, without any apparent data \nregarding the IRS’s capabilities. USCIS, All Comments & Responses, 84FR13687, \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 24 of 74\n(at row 59), available at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?\nref_nbr=201910-1615-006. Further, USCIS’s external consultations regarding the \nrevisions to its fee-waiver information-collection did not involve consultation with \nthe IRS.  \nc.  USCIS dismissed concerns that the new standard will increase its own workload \nand backlog, but provided no supporting data and did not suggest that the agency \nhad planned for how it will handle applications under the revised standard. \nIII. 2020 FEE-WAIVER CUTS AND FEE INCREASES  \nA. Proposal to Restrict Fee Waivers and Raise Fees \n94.  Shortly before USCIS submitted its October 2019 revisions to the fee-waiver form \nand instructions for OMB review, DHS submitted a rulemaking proposal to OMB that also aimed \nto reduce fee-waiver eligibility. On November 14, 2019, DHS published that proposed rule in the \nFederal Register, allowing commenters until December 16 to comment on the proposal generally, \nbut 60 days to comment on proposed forms. 84 Fed. Reg. 62,280, 62,280, 62,349-56 (Nov. 14, \n2019) (Fee Proposal). \n95.  The Fee Proposal included key aspects of the October 2019 fee-waiver actions, in \nsome cases offering no explanation other than that it “would update the language in the regulation \nto codify” what was “provided in the previous I-912 notice.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,299. For instance, \nit narrowed the fee-waiver eligibility standard, including by eliminating means-tested benefits-\nbased  applications;  and  mandated  that  applicants  use  USCIS’s  form  and  submit  specified \ndocumentation of income, generally including a tax transcript. See id. at 62,363 (proposed 8 C.F.R. \n§ 106.3). The Fee Proposal also addressed other topics covered in the October 2019 updates to the \nUSCIS Policy Manual. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 25 of 74\n96.  The Fee Proposal additionally extended the approach of the October 2019 fee-\nwaiver actions, by eliminating hardship-based fee-waiver applications, as well as benefits-based \nones, and setting a single, lower income standard for fee-waiver applications: 125 percent of the \nfederal poverty guidelines. Further, DHS proposed to restrict fee-waiver applications to the narrow \ncategories of immigrants covered by 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), and to impose other new eligibility \nrestrictions. Its documentation requirements were stricter than the October 2019 fee-waiver form’s, \nin ways that the Fee Proposal did not acknowledge in its preamble or explain. See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n62,363 (proposed 8 C.F.R. § 106.3).  \n97.  Like the October 2019 fee-waiver actions, the Fee Proposal linked fee waivers to \nfees. The Fee Proposal sought to increase many USCIS and CBP fees, often significantly, stating \nthat without the fee-waiver changes, fees would go up  even more. The Fee Proposal  also \nintroduced new fees, seeking to shift more costs to certain types of applications or groups of \napplicants that, under existing law, had no fees, exemptions from otherwise applicable fees, or fees \nwhose increases has been capped in prior rulemakings. The Fee Proposal additionally limited the \npayment devices that USCIS would accept. \n98.  The Fee Proposal was tied to stated budget amounts for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 \nand a related review of IEFA fees. The stated budgets excluded the fees for and costs of premium \nprocessing, and included $207.6 million that DHS planned to raise from immigrants seeking \nUSCIS benefits and then transfer to ICE, DHS’s immigration enforcement component. The IEFA \nfee review was conducted pursuant to a statutory requirement for biennial reviews of an agency’s \nuser fees, see 31 U.S.C. § 902(a)(8), and was based on the stated budget figures and multiple \nassumptions, including assumptions about the number of applications that immigrants would \nsubmit, the percent of applications that would be fee-paying, and the costs associated with different \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 26 of 74\ntypes of USCIS activities. DHS stated that if fee and fee-waiver law did not change, DHS’s \nforecasted non-premium revenue would be less than the stated budgets. DHS thus used the IEFA \nfee review to calculate new, proposed fees at amounts that it estimated would cover the stated \nbudget amounts.  \n99.  DHS failed to provide notice of key assumptions, calculations, estimates, models, \nor rationales on which the Fee Proposal and the IEFA fee review rested.  \n100.  Although DHS stated that the proposed changes were needed for budget reasons, \nthe Fee Proposal did not discuss USCIS budget needs for fiscal year 2021 or beyond, when any \nnew fee rule would be in effect. \n101.  DHS did not otherwise explain its asserted 2019 and 2020 budgets. For instance: \na.  DHS did not identify all the operations, policies, and practices that it sought to fund \nor explain how they all fell within the scope of DHS’s fee-funding authority under \n8 U.S.C. § 1356(m).  \nb.  DHS used unclear, incomplete, and vague terms to describe the composition of the \nstated budgets and new costs.  \nc.  The Fee Proposal  stated that DHS sought to  “maintain an adequate level  of \noperations,” 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,286, but did not explain what such a level entails or \nwhy the stated budget amounts were necessary to maintain it.  \nd.  DHS did not provide other key budgeting assumptions. It referenced its “staffing \nallocation model,” id., but did not provide that model or any other model used to \ncreate the budget or relevant inputs.  \ne.  DHS’s description of its estimates and methodologies were unclear and incomplete. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 27 of 74\nf.  DHS did not describe the relationship between the figures on which the proposal \nrelied and recent DHS forecasts, results, and data. \ng.  DHS did not explain the extent to which the stated budgets took into account recent \nor upcoming changes in law, policy, or operations. Though DHS acknowledged \nthat the budgets failed to take into account certain cost savings, DHS did not explain \nor estimate the impact of that omission. \nh.  DHS did not explain the relationship between its stated budget figures (and the \noperations those budgets would fund) and other sources of money available to fund \nUSCIS or CBP (and the operations those sources would fund). \n102.  DHS did not explain or justify the composition of its revenue estimates. DHS did \nnot provide all of the data, assumptions, or models from which it derived its revenue forecasts, \nincluding assumptions about the use of other available funds or the assumptions underlying its \nworkload forecasts. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,288-89. DHS identified certain periods it had used for \ndata collection, but did not explain why those periods were chosen. DHS did not explain the extent \nto which it had taken into account pertinent trends or upcoming changes in law, policy, or \noperations. \n103.  DHS did not identify or explain all of the key data, assumptions, or models that it \nused to  calculate proposed fees, by dividing  the assumed budget  figures across fee-paying \napplications. For example, DHS broke the relevant budget figures into buckets of costs, e.g., \n“management and oversight” and “fraud detection and prevention,” and spread those costs across \ndifferent types of immigration applications. Its vague discussion of how the costs were divided \nacross application types did not explain the tables of figures provided. Further, DHS provided little \ndetail about what fell into these buckets of costs and did not provide the models and staffing \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 28 of 74\nprojections it used to generate the total amounts for each bucket (or such totals themselves). DHS \nchanged its model to reflect costs that had not been incorporated into past models and did not \nexplain why. \n104.  The Fee Proposal and IEFA fee review reflected different estimates of key figures. \nDHS did not explain the difference. \n105.  The Fee Proposal inaccurately summarized some of the changes it proposed, and \nreferenced, but failed to include, figures that DHS stated would support its assertions about fee-\nwaiver trends. DHS also failed to provide relevant context for its figures. For instance, it compared \nits current estimates to 2016 estimates, rather than actual and current figures. \n106.  After publishing the Fee Proposal, DHS changed the docket, the comment period, \nand the substance of its proposal. Through November 22, 2019, DHS posted dozens of documents \nin the online docket for the Fee Proposal at regulations.gov, including proposed changes to forms; \na “small entity analysis”; analysis regarding the IEFA account; and an economic analysis. Then, \non  December  9,  2019,  after  earlier  rejecting  calls  for  a  longer  comment  period  with  the \nunsupported representation that its financial situation was dire, DHS changed the content of its \nproposal and the deadlines to comment. 84 Fed Reg. 67,243 (Dec. 9, 2019) (Supplemental \nProposal). The Supplemental Proposal revised DHS’s calculation of the money that it would \ntransfer to ICE, included new descriptions of the ICE costs DHS intended to fund, and stated that \nthe change would affect calculated USCIS fees, but did not provide a new set of proposed fees. \nThe Supplemental Proposal set a new deadline of December 30, 2019 to comment on the Fee \nProposal, the Supplemental Proposal, and the proposed forms, shortening the period to comment \non the proposed forms. Then, on January 24, 2020, DHS reopened the comment period until \nFebruary 10, 2020. See 85 Fed. Reg. 4243 (Jan. 24, 2020). On February 3, 2020, but not before, \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 29 of 74\nDHS hosted a meeting with some members of the public to discuss its fee-modeling software and \nmethodology. \n107.  Multiple commenters informed DHS that the Fee Proposal and Supplemental \nProposal failed to provide enough information to enable thorough responses. Commenters also \ninformed DHS that the periods to comment on the Fee Proposal, Supplemental Proposal, and \nsupporting materials were insufficient.  \nB. The 2020 Fee Rule \n108.  On August 3, 2020, DHS published its final rule in the Federal Register and set an \neffective date of October 2, 2020. 85 Fed. Reg. 46,788 (2020 Fee Rule). The rule adopted nearly \nall of the changes that DHS had proposed and stated that it “relies on all the justifications \narticulated in the [Fee Proposal] except as articulated” in the Federal Register notice. Id. at 46,790. \n109.  The 2020 Fee Rule eliminates fee waivers for nearly all immigrants and USCIS \nfilings. It makes fee waivers generally available only to requesters seeking or holding specialized \ntypes of humanitarian protections: (1) those covered by 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), (2) some children \nseeking or holding Special Immigration Juvenile Status (SIJS) and (3) certain Afghan or Iraqi \n“Special Immigrants.” Further, for these groups of immigrants, the 2020 Fee Rule replaces the \n“unable to pay” standard in current law, 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c)(1)(i), with a single income standard: \neligible immigrants can only request fee waivers if their household income is at or below 125 \npercent  of  the  federal  poverty  guidelines.  85  Fed.  Reg.  at  46,920  (to  be  codified  at  8 \nC.F.R. § 106.3(c)). Thus, for example, a single person earns too much to qualify if his or her \nincome is over $15,950 per year. Additionally, the 2020 Fee Rule only permits fee-waiver \napplications using USCIS’s prescribed form and supported by certain specified documents. In \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 30 of 74\nmany circumstances, the rule requires applicants to obtain and submit a tax transcript or other IRS \ndocument. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,920 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 106.3(d), (f)). \n110.  With these new restrictions, eligible requestors can seek waivers of any fees for \nimmigration benefits and “any associated filing,” “up to and including adjustment of status,” as \nwell as certain citizenship-related forms. 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,920 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 106.3(a)(1)-(3)).  \n111.  The 2020 Fee Rule eliminates fee waiver applications for all other immigrants. \n112.  The 2020 Fee Rule permits, but narrows, the USCIS director’s discretion to make \nexceptions to the revised fee-waiver rule. While the current regulation enables the director to waive \nany fee when “in the public interest and the action is consistent with other applicable law,” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 103.7(d), under the 2020 Fee Rule, the director may only consider exemptions for certain \npopulations or in certain listed circumstances, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,920 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 106.3(b), (e)). \n113.  DHS characterized the near elimination of fee waivers as necessary to limit fee \nincreases, increase the number of immigrants paying for USCIS applications, and reduce the dollar \namount of fees waived. The fee-waiver restrictions are part of a package of changes that DHS \nasserted were necessary for such purposes. Like the Fee Proposal, the 2020 Fee Rule creates new \nUSCIS fees, eliminates prior fee exemptions and caps on fee waivers, and raises a number of fees.  \n114.  For instance, the rule eliminates a reduced fee for low-income individuals seeking \nnaturalization, and without allowing any fee waivers, imposes new fees on individuals seeking \nasylum, before they have even had the chance to gain authorization to work. Under the 2020 Fee \nRule, applying for asylum will cost $50; a first employment authorization application will cost \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 31 of 74\n$550, plus $30 for biometrics. Naturalization fees will nearly double, to $1,170, and other fees will \nincrease as much as 546 percent. \n115.  The 2020 Fee Rule also raises fees charged by other agencies. It increases the cost \nof certain applications made to CBP, another DHS component. Further, the $50 asylum fee means \nthat individuals who are placed in removal proceedings before the Department of Justice’s EOIR \nprior to filing for asylum will also face a new $50 fee when they seek asylum, withholding of \nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture as a defense. Other USCIS fees \nalso apply in removal proceedings. DHS dismissed concerns about such fees by stating it “did not \ncollaborate with DOJ” in its fee modeling and that the matter was within the other agency’s \njurisdiction. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,793. \n116.  Other measures in the 2020 Fee Rule include restrictions on DHS’s acceptance of \nchecks, an allowance for USCIS to impose other restrictions on the methods that immigrants can \nuse to pay USCIS fees, and restrictions on how immigrants can receive documents from USCIS. \nSee Fed. Reg. at 46,914, 46,916 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 103.2(a)(7)(ii)(D), (b)(19)(iii), \n106.1(b))). DHS additionally submitted changes to dozens of forms to OMB for approval. \n117.  The 2020 Fee Rule includes provisions, rationales, and data that were not discussed \nin the Fee Proposal and that commenters could not have anticipated. These include: \na.  A  distinction  among  categories  of  SIJS:  abused,  abandoned,  and  neglected \njuveniles who are eligible for benefits under immigration law. The 2020 Fee Rule \nallows some SIJS to continue to seek fee waivers, but not others. 85 Fed. Reg. at \n46,920 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 106.3(a)(2)(i)),  \nb.  A distinction among naturalization-related forms. The 2020 Fee Rule allows that \nfee-waiver eligible immigrants can seek waivers of some citizenship-related fees, \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 32 of 74\nbut not the fee for appealing an adverse naturalization decision. See id. (to be \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. § 106.3(a)(3)). \nc.  A surcharge for applicants who file paper, rather than online, applications. See 85 \nFed. Reg. at 46,919 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 106.2(d)). \nd.  A $30 biometrics fee for asylum seekers and certain residents of the Northern \nMariana  Islands.  See  85  Fed.  Reg.  at  46,918  (to  be  codified  at  8  C.F.R. \n§ 106.2(a)(32)(i)). \ne.  Data and rationales not in the 2020 Fee Proposal, including data regarding fee \nwaivers,  justifications  for  fee-waiver  restrictions,  and  information  about  the \ncomposition of the asserted budgets.  \n(1) Violations of INA \n118.  Under the INA, DHS can only set fees to recover “costs of providing” “adjudication \nand naturalization services” or “additional costs associated with the administration of the fees \ncollected.” 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m).  \n119.  When DHS set new fees, it sought to cover costs that do not fall within the scope \nof section § 1356(m). Those include costs of national security and intelligence work, salaries of \nUSCIS staff assigned to work for other components of DHS, and the cost of a program to provide \ninformation to other government entities. \n120.  DHS did not explain how it sought to comply with section 1356(m). In the Fee \nProposal, DHS stated a vague and confusing description of how it was applying the statutory limits \non IEFA spending. In the final rule, DHS referenced its authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m) only \nin  conclusory  terms,  did  not  identify  all  of  the  USCIS  operations  it  sought  to  fund,  used \nunexplained and vague terms to describe those it did identify, and did not explain how all such \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 33 of 74\noperations fall within the limits of 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m). DHS also raised CBP fees without stating \na budget or funding need to justify the increase, and without providing any explanation of how the \nnew CBP funds will be used in accordance with statute. Further, DHS’s rule increased fees charged \nby DOJ, without any discussion of that agency’s funding needs or uses. \n121.  The  INA  requires  that  the  DHS  secretary  “shall  permit”  certain  groups  of \nimmigrants to apply for fee waivers. 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7).  \n122.  Under the 2020 Fee Rule, some immigrants whose applications are covered by 8 \nU.S.C. § 1255(l)(7) will not be able to seek fee waivers because the required documentation is \nunavailable. For instance, in some circumstances, the IRS does not provide required documents as \nquickly as needed to meet short USCIS filing deadlines. Further, while the rule lists certain types \nof documentation an income-earning applicant without a tax return can submit, some immigrants \nwill earn income that does not generate any of the listed documentation (e.g., W-2 or certain \nstatements of government payments). Such documents are not legally required for all types of work \nindividuals perform. The 2020 Fee Rule provides an exception to documentation requirements for \nsome, but not all, individuals covered by 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7). \n123.  DHS did not acknowledge or explain the effect of the 2020 Fee Rule in preventing \napplicants from applying based on what type of work they perform, whether they filed taxes, or \nthe restrictions of IRS’s system. DHS also did not discuss the availability of W-2 forms and the \nlimitations on the availability of tax transcript or other documents from the IRS, explain why it \nchose to require W-2 forms from individuals without tax returns, or explain why it had changed \nposition since the October 2019 fee-waiver form change. DHS failed to respond to comments \ndescribing the challenges immigrants will face in obtaining required documentation. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 34 of 74\n124.  The INA requires that individuals receive certain immigration benefits if they \nsatisfy listed criteria, which do not include any measure of an applicant’s financial circumstances. \nSee,  e.g.,  id.  §§ 1186a(c)(3)  (removal  on  conditions  for  residence),  1452(a)  (certificate  of \ncitizenship). For such benefits, the 2020 Fee Rule means that applicants who cannot receive fee \nwaivers also cannot apply for the benefit if they are unable to pay the requisite fee. \n(2) DHS’s Use of Unreasonable and Unexplained Financial Estimates \n125.  In support of the 2020 Fee Rule, DHS produced a revised IEFA analysis, dated May \n2020. The 2020 Fee Rule and the revised IEFA analysis use the 2019 and 2020 budgets stated in \nthe Fee Proposal, adjusted to eliminate two sets of expenses that had been included at the proposal \nstage: funds intended for transfer to ICE and expenses associated with Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program. As in the proposal, DHS estimated revenue that it would \nearn under the current fee schedule, and then set fees to recover the entirety of the stated budget \namounts. Though DHS made adjustments to reflect changes to the final rule’s determinations about \nwho should pay fees, key inputs to the IEFA analysis, such as estimates of staffing needs and filing \nvolume, remained the same. \n126.  DHS failed to support its conclusion that it could not continue to use the 2016 fee \nschedule. With reasoning relied on in the final rule, the Fee Proposal stated that maintaining the \ncurrent fee schedule “would risk degrading USCIS operations.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,288. The 2020 \nFee Rule also states that “new fees will help reduce backlogs,” 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,861, and that \nmaintaining the current fee schedule “could result” in other reductions in service, id. at 46,904 \n(emphasis added). But DHS did not explain the extent to which any particular operations were at \nrisk under the 2016 fee schedule or the extent of new operations it intended to fund, explain how \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 35 of 74\nits budget enables the reduction of backlogs or the accomplishment of any other operational goal, \nor otherwise support its assertions. \n127.  In setting fees to match the stated budgets for 2019 and 2020, DHS relied on \nestimates that were not reasonable or supported.  \na.  Most of the analysis underlying the 2020 Fee Rule was conducted in 2017, and \nDHS’s budget predictions were for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. The 2020 Fee Rule \ntakes effect after the start of fiscal year 2021.  \nb.  DHS did not suggest that its stated figures represent predictions about fiscal year \n2021 or beyond. \nc.  DHS’s operations have not matched its 2017 predictions. As DHS recognized, \n“filing trends have changed” since its IEFA fee review, and DHS’s projections \nregarding  the  numbers  of  applications  that  immigrants  would  file  “did  not \nmaterialize” even in fiscal year 2019. See id. at 46,870. \nd.  Since 2017, and even since the publication of the Fee Proposal, DHS has made, \nproposed, or attempted to make multiple changes in immigration policy that could \nsignificantly affect USCIS budget and revenue. Other aspects of the immigration \napplication, policy, and funding environments have also changed, and were in flux \nwhen DHS adopted the 2020 Fee Rule. DHS’s figures did not account for any of \nthese changes. \ne.  Some of DHS’s estimates relied on data from 2016 and 2017. Data from that period \nwas likely to be anomalous, for reasons including the December 2016 fee-schedule \nchange, the November 2016 election, and a spike in naturalization applications \nduring 2016 and 2017.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 36 of 74\nf.  The 2019 and 2020 budget figures did not reflect the impact of cost savings that \nhad already materialized. \ng.  The 2019 and 2020 budget figures reflected costs that, in adopting the 2020 Fee \nRule, DHS identified as unnecessary for their original purpose but retained in the \nbudget. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,790. \nh.  When DHS adopted the rule, it was projecting ending the current fiscal year with a \nsurplus, not a deficit. \n128.  When DHS adopted the 2020 Fee Rule, it had, but did not use, more recent data \nand budget estimates, including budget figures submitted to Congress, actual fiscal year 2019 \nresults, and  an operating plan USCIS completed in  April 2020.  DHS  did  not  provide  any \nexplanation of how its figures relate to the agency’s more recent results and predictions. Further, \nDHS rejected the option of using more accurate or recent estimates without a reasoned explanation. \nThe agency stated it was concerned that using new figures would constitute a failure to provide \nproper notice. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,874. But DHS did not explain why that adjustment of figures \n(as opposed to others it did make) would constitute a lack of notice under law, or why it could not \nuse  more  recent  figures  to  reconsider  the  proposal  altogether.  Additionally,  DHS  cited  the \n“constantly evolving immigration policy environment,” id., without considering that DHS itself \ncould slow down the pace of policy change. Although DHS cited its obligations under certain \nstatutes, see id., no law required DHS to change USCIS fees in 2020. \n129.  The 2020 Fee Rule’s calculations reflect other errors. For instance, they are based \non the assumption that immigrants will apply for benefits at the same rate and pace, under the 2020 \nFee Rule, as they would without it. But data before the agency shows that increased fees can deter \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 37 of 74\napplicants, and in parts of the 2020 Fee Rule, DHS acknowledged such effects. DHS failed to \nexplain why it could not incorporate an estimate of such effects in its modeling. \n130.  DHS also overestimated the number of fee waivers that USCIS will continue to \nissue under the 2020 Fee Rule. In calculating the extra fees that will be paid by immigrants no \nlonger able to seek fee waivers, DHS assumed that all immigration benefits requests that are \neligible for waivers under current law will remain eligible. It failed to factor in the rule’s \nrestrictions on eligible immigrants and forms. \n131.  DHS failed to explain many other aspects of its calculations. The 2020 Fee Rule \ngenerally adopted the Fee Proposal’s calculations, which themselves lacked explanation, with little \nadditional  explanation.  DHS  did  not  provide  key  data,  models,  or  assumptions  needed  to \nunderstand its budget, revenue, and other figures. DHS also did not explain the extent to which its \nbudget took into account savings DHS suggested the 2020 Fee Rule will generate. DHS calculated \nsome fees without using the IEFA fee review model and without explaining the need for or use of \nthe fee revenue. \n132.  Other aspects of the calculations in the 2020 Fee Rule are unsupported by data or \nreasoning or conflict with data before the agency. \n(3) DHS’s Unexplained and Improper Policy Goals  \n133.  In adopting the 2020 Fee Rule, DHS sought to pursue objectives in addition to \nraising revenue. These other objectives were unexplained, unsupported, and/or improper. \n134.  For instance, DHS sought to deter or exclude individuals who are not “self-\nsufficient” from seeking immigration benefits. In its original Fee Proposal materials, DHS stated \nit was “concerned” that maintaining a reduced naturalization fee “may result in the naturalization \nof more individuals who will be reliant upon public benefits rather than embodying the principle \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 38 of 74\nof self-sufficiency that is central to U.S. immigration laws.” Regulatory Impact Analysis, USCIS \nFee Schedule and Changes to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements 119 (Sept. \n2019) (posted by DHS and later withdrawn from docket). In the same document, DHS stated that \nfee waivers “suggest[] an inability to be self-sufficient,” and concluded that elimination of many \nfee waivers would be consistent “with congressional intent in noncitizens maintaining self-\nsufficiency.” Id. at 27. Similarly, the 2020 Fee Rule states that maintaining fee-waivers and \nreduced-fee naturalization applications would not be “in accordance with the principle of self-\nsufficiency that Congress has frequently emphasized,” 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,858, and concludes that \ncertain fee-waiver authority should be restricted due to a concern about individuals becoming \n“public charges,” id. at 46,828. \n135.  DHS did not explain or support its assumptions about self-sufficiency, the receipt \nof public benefits, or immigrants being “public charges.” DHS also did not reconcile its concerns \nabout which types of individuals will naturalize or seek other immigration benefits with its \nrepeated suggestion that new fees will not reduce the number of people seeking immigration \nbenefits. See, e.g., 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,797, 46,858. Additionally, no law establishes encouraging \n“self-sufficiency” or deterring naturalization of immigrants receiving public benefits as a general \ngoal of immigration law or a factor that DHS should consider in setting fees. To the contrary, \nCongress, through the INA, has made immigrants’ likelihood of becoming a “public charge” or \ntheir ability to satisfy minimum  financial requirements a consideration  in  only  limited and \nspecified circumstances, which do not include naturalization and fee waivers. \n136.  DHS also sought to deter certain immigrants from seeking asylum. Asylum law \nreflects an intent to enable individuals to apply for and receive protections from the threat of danger \nabroad, not to deter individuals through fees. But the Fee Proposal stated that a fee for asylum \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 39 of 74\napplications would “discourage frivolous filings.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,320. The final rule adopted \nthis reasoning, and also asserted that DHS did “not intend to deter legitimate asylum seekers,” 85 \nFed. Reg. at 46,850, or “meritorious asylum claims,” id. at 46,844. DHS did not explain or support \nits suggestion that it faces a problem of frivolous filings, or its assumption that an asylum \napplication fee will deter frivolous filers and not legitimate ones. DHS also did not recognize or \nexplain the agency’s change in approach, compared to past fee rules, in which DHS stated that \nfees were “not designed to function as tariffs, to generate general revenue to support broader policy \ndecisions, or to deter certain behavior.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 73,312 n.69; see also 75 Fed. Reg. 58,962, \n58,970 (Sept. 24, 2010) (similar, 2010 fee rule).  \n137.  DHS repeatedly stated that it sought to restrict fee waivers and raise fees in order \nto pursue a “beneficiary pays” system. DHS stated in its proposal that a “beneficiary pays” \nprinciple means that “beneficiaries of a service pay for the cost of providing that service.” 84 Fed. \nReg. at 62,298. The final rule adopted this reasoning and equated the principle with removing fee \nwaivers, exemptions, and caps, such that immigrants pay all the costs in DHS’s asserted budget. \n138.  DHS did not reconcile its discussion and application of the beneficiary pays \nprinciple with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) document that the 2020 Fee Rule \ncites. That document recognizes that a “beneficiary pays” system can incorporate reduced or \nwaived fees. It also recognizes that other systems may be more equitable or efficient. Further, in \ncontrast to DHS’s rule, it suggests that under a “beneficiary pays” system, costs for public benefits \nshould be borne by the public, not by individual users. See GAO, Federal User Fees: A Design \nGuide 7-11 (May 2008) (GAO-08-386SP).  \n139.  DHS’s use of the “beneficiary pays” principle is internally inconsistent. The 2020 \nFee Rule exempts some immigrants from otherwise applicable fees, caps some fees increases, and \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 40 of 74\nallows some fee waivers. Thus, although DHS repeatedly referred to the beneficiary pays principle \nas a reason to increase or create some fees and restrict fee waivers, its references to this principle \ndo not explain why DHS decided to make such changes in some instances but not others.  \n140.  In adopting the 2020 Fee Rule, DHS asserted that “different immigration services \nprovide varying levels of societal net benefits” and suggested that holding fees below their costs \nhas been a way to “account” for these differences. 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,890. DHS did not explain \nthis statement or whether it applied this principle in the 2020 Fee Rule in deciding which fee limits \nto preserve and which not.  \n141.  DHS is pursuing other measures aimed at addressing its non-revenue policy goals. \nDHS did not explain why the 2020 Fee Rule was necessary, in addition to other measures, to \nachieve its policy goals.  \n(4) DHS’s Other Attempts to Justify Making More Immigrants Pay More  \n \n142.  In multiple other ways, DHS failed to support aspects of the 2020 Fee Rule. For \ninstance,  the  2020  Fee  Rule’s  elimination  of  hardship-based  fee  waivers  relies  on  a \nmisinterpretation of DHS data and fails to take into account the importance of such fee waivers. \nDHS’s assertion that the 2020 Fee Rule does not “make immigrant benefits inaccessible to low \nincome applicants who have financial hardships” contradicts other statements in the 2020 Fee Rule \nand  is  unsupported.  85  Fed.  Reg.  at  46,822.  The  rule  eliminates  benefits-based  fee-waiver \napplications for reasons of equity but cites no data regarding means-tested benefits standards, fails \nto consider alternatives, and fails to consider the equitable principles reflected in USCIS’s current \npractice, under the 2011 Memorandum. \n143.  DHS established an income ceiling for fee waivers based on a figure that is used \nelsewhere in immigration law. But DHS did not explain why such consistency was relevant or take \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 41 of 74\ninto account the differences between fee waivers and the contexts in which the 125-percent \nstandard is used elsewhere. Its decision is also inconsistent with other aspects of DHS’s reasoning \nand the October 2019 fee-waiver actions, in which USCIS asserted that two other criteria—\nhardship and earning below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines—were appropriate to \nmeasure an individual’s ability to pay an immigration fee. \n144.  The 2020 Fee Rule restricts fee waivers to only certain populations of immigrants. \nDHS failed to support its distinctions between the populations who will be able to seek fee waivers \nunder the 2020 Fee Rule and the other groups of immigrants who will not. \n145.  The 2020 Fee Rule offers no explanation for aspects of its fee-waiver form and \ndocumentation requirements. For other aspects, DHS provided justifications that are not supported \nby data, fail to take into account the impact of the new rule on individual applicants, fail to match \nsolutions to actual problems, and fail to consider the range of types of documentation DHS could \naccept. For instance, although DHS expressed a concern about receiving unsigned tax forms, it did \nnot support its assertion that the rule will decrease administrative burden, show that USCIS \ncurrently experiences a problem with receiving incomplete tax forms, or consider the alternatives \nof clarifying existing form instructions or requiring documentation that is more accessible than a \ntax transcript or other required documentation. While the 2020 Fee Rule permits some applicants \nto submit alternative documentation, DHS did not explain why others applicants should not receive \na similar allowance or justify its choice of allowable alternative documentation. DHS did not \nconsider the full range of challenges that fee-waiver eligible immigrants would face in obtaining \nthe required documentation. DHS did not consider the effect of its rule on individuals unable to \nobtain required documents. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 42 of 74\n146.  DHS made unsupported distinctions between the people or types of forms eligible \nfor fee waivers and those not. For instance, DHS decided to allow fee waivers for some SIJS \nbecause it concluded they are “particularly vulnerable, id. at 46,815, but did not explain how it \nconcluded that other SIJS are not also vulnerable enough to benefit from fee waivers. The final \nrule allows fee waivers for some citizenship-related forms, but not others, and failed to explain the \ndistinction. In the preamble of the rule, DHS published a list of forms eligible for fee waivers that \nwas in conflict with its own new rule, as it omitted at least one eligible form, a 290B form. \n147.  DHS stated that it restricted the USCIS director’s discretion to issue additional fee \nwaivers or fee exemptions due to a concern that the director might otherwise expand waivers or \nexemptions “beyond what may be fiscally sound” and “shift[] the burden to just a few payers.” 85 \nFed. Reg. at 46,828. These and other assertions about the effect of the current exemption authority \nare unsupported and illogical. DHS did not explain all of the distinctions it drew between \npopulations potentially eligible for director-issued exemptions and those not. \n148.  In other ways as well, DHS failed to provide reasoned analysis to support the 2020 \nFee Rule’s fee-waiver provisions. For instance, DHS relied on assertions about fee-waiver trends \nand the impact of fee waivers that are unexplained and do not match the data before the agency or \nreflect the relevant context. \n149.  DHS failed to provide a reasoned justification for adopting multiple new fees for \nasylum-seekers: a $50 fee for applying for asylum, a new $550 fee for a first employment \nauthorization, and a new $30 biometrics fee for seeking or renewing employment authorization. \nThough DHS suggested that it was mitigating the harm to asylum seekers by allowing that some \nindividuals, in effect, receive a refund of the $50 fee, DHS’s solution does not match the problem, \nas the $50 discount only applies once an individual is granted asylum and later applies for lawful \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 43 of 74\npermanent resident status. Additionally, especially in light of this effective refund, DHS failed to \nexplain how the $50 application fee will support asserted goals, including raising revenue or \nmitigating the increases of other fees. DHS’s assertions about the need for fee revenue also conflict \nwith other aspects of the 2020 Fee Rule and its reasoning, including DHS’s goal of deterring some \napplicants and its acknowledgment that some will not be able to afford the fee. \n150.  DHS failed to consider the effect of its rule on individuals in removal proceedings. \nIn that context, the new $50 fee will operate to bar indigent individuals from seeking mandatory \nforms of relief from removal; many of these individuals are initially detained by the government \nand have no meaningful form of income. Although removal proceedings are governed by DOJ and \nits own fee regulation, that regulation incorporates this USCIS fee. DHS failed to consider \nalternatives within its authority to avoid hurting individuals in removal proceedings. In contrast, \nDHS elsewhere distinguished between fees charged in USCIS proceedings and those charged in \nDOJ proceedings, and kept DOJ fees the same, even while changing the USCIS fee. \n151.  With reasoning adopted in the final rule, DHS exempted certain unaccompanied \nminors in removal proceedings from the $50 asylum fee due to concerns about “undue delay.” 84 \nFed. Reg. at 62,319. DHS failed to explain why this same concern does not apply to other asylum \nseekers. For instance, DHS’s decision not to exempt other unaccompanied minors was inconsistent \nwith the purpose of the statute it cited, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457. Further, DHS failed to take into account the \nvariety of circumstances in which other asylum-seekers will have an urgent need to apply, \nincluding because they face a one-year bar to apply. It ignored or offered only conclusory and \nunsupported responses to comments explaining such needs. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 44 of 74\n152.  DHS recognized that its predecessor agency earlier declined to adopt a fee for \nseeking asylum. DHS did not describe the reasoning of earlier decisions not to adopt an asylum \nfee or explain the extent to which (or why) DHS’s position has changed. \n153.  DHS failed to reconcile the new asylum-seeker fees, which it acknowledged would \ndeter applicants, with the goals and purposes of asylum law, to enable individuals to seek and \nreceive protections from the threat of danger abroad. \n154.  DHS ignored data in the record about the impact of the new fees on asylum seekers, \nfailed to consider the impact of new fees on asylum seekers’ families and their communities, and \nfailed to provide a reasoned justification for rejecting alternatives, such as installment payments, \nthat would have lessened the harm of new fees. Though in some parts of the 2020 Fee Rule DHS \nacknowledged that the $50 asylum application fee would cause some immigrants to not apply, \nelsewhere it assumed that all asylum seekers (or all non-frivolous ones) can afford to pay a $50 \nfee before the end of the statutory one-year period to apply. That assumption is unsupported and \nunreasoned. \n155.  DHS stated that it would not allow fee waivers for asylum seekers because the cost \nof processing fee waiver requests would be enough to eliminate the revenue earned. DHS did not \nreconcile this statement with its assertion that the fee was affordable to asylum seekers.  \n156.  DHS asserted in its proposal that without a new employment authorization fee for \nasylum seekers, others would have to pay $10 more. In the final rule, DHS cited the beneficiary \npays principle, but failed to explain why new fees for asylum seekers were necessary to save a \nsmall amount of money for other applicants, when DHS continued to allow other fee waivers or \ncaps. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 45 of 74\n157.  DHS failed to consider the combined effects of all the new asylum-related fees on \nasylum seekers, the interaction between the new fees and its other efforts to change asylum \nregulations, and asylum seekers’ financial circumstances. In imposing new fees on asylum seekers, \nDHS also rested on unsupported assertions about filing trends and assumptions about asylum \nseekers’ budgets, as well as unreasonable interpretations of or comparisons to international law \nand other countries’ practices. DHS also failed to consider the option of providing biometrics to \nasylum seekers without an additional fee, and did not reconcile its addition of this new fee, without \nprior notice or inclusion in its modeling, with its conclusion that it could not update other aspects \nof its fee modeling to reflect recent changes. \n158.  Other provisions of the 2020 Fee Rule eliminate prior measures that limited fee \nincreases: a reduced naturalization fee for low-income immigrants, certain fee exemptions, and \npreviously-imposed caps on the increases of naturalization and other fees. At the same time, the \n2020 Fee Rule imposes a cap on the fee increase applicable to certain adoption-related fees. DHS \nstated, with reasoning adopted in the final rule, that the adoption-related fee cap was due to “public \nand humanitarian interests.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,3113. DHS did not explain why the forms for \nwhich it lifted fee exemptions, fee caps, or a reduced fee, or imposed new fees, do not involve \n“public and humanitarian interests” that would support maintaining the agency’s prior practices. \nDHS did not recognize why it adopted certain fee exemptions or limits in the first place, or explain \nwhether or why it changed its view on the relevant factors in some cases but not others. \n159.  In  other  ways,  DHS  failed  to  provide  reasoned  justifications  for  eliminating \nexemptions or fee caps. For example, DHS failed to meaningfully address comments about \napplicants’  needs  for  affordable  applications  and  made  assertions  about  fee  dynamics  and \nimmigrants’ circumstances that were unsupported and conflicted with other statements in the rule.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 46 of 74\n160.  DHS  attempted  to  justify  its  measures  to  increase  naturalization  fees  with \nunsupported assertions. It referenced an increase in naturalization filings, though applications have \ndropped for the last two years. It mischaracterized congressional intent. It cited data on reduced-\nfee filings without putting that data in the relevant context and failed to support its suggestion that \nthe  new  naturalization  fee  would  not  hinder  applications.  It  cited  high-level  figures  about \nnaturalization that do not show the factors that affect whether people naturalize. \n161.  DHS stated that it agrees with international law dictating that no one shall be \n“denied the right to change nationality,” but did not explain how its change in approach to \nnaturalization fees can be reconciled with this concern or a recommendation, cited by a commenter, \nthat high-demand benefits be affordable. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,856. \n162.  Without a reasoned justification, the 2020 Fee Rule changes DHS’s approach to \ninterim benefits: employment authorizations or other benefits that immigrants seek with their \napplications for lawful permanent residence or while such applications are pending. In 2007, DHS \ndecided to make these interim benefits free, to ensure immigrants would not have to pay for \nrenewals they needed only because of a processing delay and to avoid a perception that DHS would \nprofit  from  delaying  processing  adjustment-of-status  applications  (which  would  lead  to \nimmigrants needing to seek more interim benefit renewals). See 72 Fed. Reg. 4888, 4894 (Feb. 1, \n2007). With the 2020 Fee Rule, DHS reversed this position. It created significant new fees for \nindividuals who apply for lawful permanent residence and are waiting for DHS to finish processing \ntheir applications. DHS mischaracterized its 2007 decision and failed to explain whether or why \nthe concerns that motivated DHS in 2007 are no longer true. DHS relied on assertions about the \nbenefit of the change that are unsupported and do not take into account the impact of the new fees \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 47 of 74\non the individuals who must pay them. DHS also failed to explain the calculations behind its \nassertions or consider alternatives that would lessen the financial burden on applicants.  \n163.  The 2020 Fee Rule reverses the agency’s prior position of charging less to children \nseeking adjustment of their status to lawful permanent residence than it charges to adults. DHS’s \nattempt to justify this change is unsupported. \n164.  The 2020 Fee Rule increases the fee that immigrants will pay to be able to return \nto the United States, after travel abroad, following the loss of a green card or other documentation. \nDHS  calculated  the  fee  increase  without  accounting  for  the  impact  of  DHS’s  closure  of \ninternational offices and using a figure for expenses paid to the Department of State that is higher \nthan what DHS was actually paying at the time the proposal was published. \n165.  DHS failed to justify the 2020 Fee Rule’s surcharge for paper-filed applications. \nAlthough DHS connected the surcharge to commenters’ concerns about inefficiencies in DHS \nprocesses, DHS did not explain how the surcharge would solve those or other problems. DHS did \nnot consider the variety of circumstances that might cause someone to use a paper application, \nrather than an online one. The surcharge is also inconsistent with DHS’s calculations, which \nassume that there will be no cost savings and that individuals are not price sensitive.  \n166.  DHS raised the USCIS and CBP fees for certain forms that both agencies use. The \nnew fees are based on a change in approach: considering some aspect of CBP expenses along with \nUSCIS’s stated budget figures. DHS stated that for, at least one form, most of the costs come from \nCBP, not USCIS. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,840. DHS failed to support this change in approach and \nthe resulting fee increases. For instance, DHS did not support the proposal’s suggestion, adopted \nthrough the final rule, that the prior approach was causing confusion; make clear how it calculated \nor used CBP figures; explain how it would use the new CBP revenue; or explain why it could not \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 48 of 74\nset CBP fees to equal USCIS fees without changing its fee-calculation method. DHS also did not \naddress the impact on, and potential savings for, immigrants of continuing to calculate USCIS fees \nusing only USCIS costs.  \n167.  DHS increased a fee for individuals seeking protection from being removed from \nthe country under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), Pub. \nL. No. 105-100, tit. II, § 203, 111 Stat. 2160, 2916 (1997). Previously, the USCIS fee was $285 \nper individual and up to $580 for families. The 2020 Fee Rule sets the USCIS fee at $1,810 per \nindividual, more than six times the current fee. DHS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for \nthis increase. DHS recognized that, in prior years, DHS treated the program similarly to other \ntemporary programs, for which it excluded cost and revenue figures from IEFA calculations. DHS \nfailed to explain why it did not continue treating the program in a like manner, and relied on \ninternally contradictory reasoning. DHS also failed to consider the hardship the new fee will cause \nfor affected individuals, compared to the small amount of revenue it will raise.  \n168.  The 2020 Fee Rule requires that, if USCIS sends certain documents to applicants’ \nattorneys or other agents, the agency will require signature confirmation. See 85 Fed. Reg. at \n46,914 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(19)(iii)(A)). DHS stated that USCIS would use the \nU.S. Postal Service Signature Confirmation Restricted Delivery service. See id. at 46,868. DHS \nfailed to consider or respond meaningfully to concerns that the system would be unworkable. DHS \nalso failed to explain why it rejected the alternative of sending documents to be held for pickup at \na post office. \n(5) DHS’s Failure to Consider the Harm Caused by the 2020 Fee Rule \n \n169.  As commenters explained, DHS’s fee-waiver restrictions and new and increased \nfees will cause a variety of harms to immigrants, their families, and their communities, by forcing \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 49 of 74\nsome immigrants to delay or forgo applications for critical benefits or to pay fees they cannot \nafford. \n170.  DHS ignored or responded to concerns about such harm with conclusory, internally \ncontradictory, or unreasoned responses.  \n171.  For example, in some parts of the 2020 Fee Rule and its supporting material, DHS \nrecognized that the rule will mean some immigrants cannot apply, will cause financial hardship, \nor will mean that immigrants must put off other expenses. Elsewhere, DHS stated it does not know \nhow sensitive immigrants seeking benefits are to the fees USCIS charge. Still elsewhere, DHS \nmade unsupported assertions that the rule will not affect individuals’ ability to apply or cause other \nharm.  \n172.  DHS did not consider the circumstances that limit immigrants’ ability to pay fees. \nFor instance, DHS made unsupported and illogical assertions about immigrants’ budgets, their \nability to increase their savings, their ability to access or afford credit, and the relative significance \nto immigrants of a particular cost. DHS failed to consider the particular challenges faced by \nimmigrants applying for employment authorization without yet having permission to earn money \nin the United States. It also failed to assess the range of financial circumstances faced by \nimmigrants, to consider how short filing deadlines affect individuals’ ability to pay fees, to address \nthe cumulative effects of this rule with other rulemakings and initiatives, or to consider the \ncombined effect of multiple fees on the same immigrant or multiple members of the same family.  \n173.  In responding to comments, DHS made unsupported statements about its beliefs or \ndisagreements with commenters’ evidence and dismissed studies on unreasonable grounds.  \n174.  Instead  of  engaging  with  commenters’  concerns,  DHS  repeatedly  relied  on \nconclusory references to its budget needs, the beneficiary pays principle, the existence of fee \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 50 of 74\nwaivers for some applicants, and its lack of intent to harm or prohibit applications. For instance, \nDHS responded to commenters’ concerns about the harm caused by the I-929 fee, set to increase \nby more than 500 percent, with only conclusory references to the availability of fee waivers and \nno consideration of the fee’s impact on individuals ineligible for such waivers. DHS stated that it \nexpected that many applicants would seek fee waivers, and failed to explain why it should not thus \nwaive the fee entirely, as DHS has done with other fees for which many applicants seek fee \nwaivers. See 85 Fed. Reg. 46,855; see also 84 Fed. Reg. at 62,302. \n175.  DHS unreasonably downplayed the importance of immigration benefits, such as \nemployment authorization, a certificate of citizenship, and a provisional unlawful presence waiver, \nto immigrants and their families.  \n176.  DHS evaluated the 2020 Fee Rule pursuant to a statutory requirement that agencies \nassess rules that may affect family well-being. See 5 U.S.C. § 601 note (regarding “Assessment of \nFederal Regulations and Policies on Families”). DHS’s assessment and its conclusion that “the \nbenefits of the new fees justify the financial impact on the family,” 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,906, are \nconclusory  and  unsupported;  fail  to  account  for  the  relevant  factors; and  ignore  comments \nexplaining the multiple ways in which the 2020 Fee Rule will harm families, by making it difficult \nfor immigrants to afford the benefits that enable immediate family members to stay together.  \n177.  DHS’s evaluation of the impacts of the 2020 Fee Rule under various executive \norders is misleading, inaccurate, and incomplete. For instance, with only a few exceptions, the \nanalysis does not address the costs that the rule will impose on individual applicants or society at \nlarge, other than the payment of funds. And DHS’s analysis does not recognize the significant cost \nor other effects of fee increases alone. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 51 of 74\n178.  DHS failed to consider or offer a reasoned explanation for rejecting alternatives \nthat would have lessened the harm caused by the 2020 Fee Rule. For instance, DHS failed to \nconsider, or offer a reasoned explanation for rejecting, other mechanisms for reducing any \nprojected budget shortfall. Such alternatives include reducing costs, increasing revenue by making \nfee-generating applications more accessible to potential filers, and funding  USCIS’s budget \nthrough other sources (such as by raising more premium processing revenue, using existing \npremium processing revenue in additional ways, seeking additional appropriations, or spending \nmore carryover funds). Among other things, DHS did not provide a reasoned justification for its \nfailure to use this rule to expand its premium-processing revenue stream. \nIV. DHS DECISIONMAKING \n179.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345-3349, and the \nHomeland Security Act (HSA), 6 U.S.C. § 113, limit which individuals may serve as acting \nofficials within DHS and USCIS and the amount of time for which they may do so.  \n180.  The FVRA specifies that when a position requiring presidential appointment and \nSenate confirmation is vacant, only certain individuals can serve as acting officials. See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 3345. With exceptions inapplicable here, such acting officials can serve for no longer than 210 \ndays after the relevant position became vacant. See id. at § 3346.  \n181.  The FVRA is the “exclusive means” for appointing acting officials, unless an \nalternative statutory provision “expressly” authorizes certain other mechanisms to fill positions in \nan acting capacity or the President makes an appointment during a Senate recess. See id. at \n§ 3347(a).  \n182.  The FVRA directs that an action taken by a person “in the performance of any \nfunction or duty of a vacant office” covered by FVRA provisions “shall have no force or effect” if \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 52 of 74\nthe action is taken by a person who is “not acting under” FVRA provisions, including section 3347, \npermitting appointment pursuant to other express statutory provisions. Id. § 3348(d)(1).  \n183.  The HSA addresses the order of succession to serve as acting DHS secretary. 6 \nU.S.C. § 113(g)(1), (2). \n184.  Then-acting USCIS director Kenneth T. Cuccinelli adopted the October 2019 fee-\nwaiver actions. The Fee Proposal was signed on November 8, 2019 by Kevin K. McAleenan, as \nacting DHS secretary. The Supplemental Proposal, as well as the January 2020 notice reopening \nthe comment period, were signed by Chad F. Wolf, as acting DHS secretary. In July 2020, the \n2020 Fee Rule was approved by Chad F. Wolf, as acting DHS secretary. The 2020 Fee Rule states, \nin one part, that Wolf signed the document and, in another part, that Wolf delegated authority to \nelectronically sign the document to Chad R. Mizelle, described as “Senior Official Performing the \nDuties of the General Counsel for DHS.” See 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,804, 46,913. \n185.  The offices of USCIS director, DHS secretary, and DHS general counsel are ones \nthat must be filled by presidential appointment, with the advice and consent of the Senate. See \n6 U.S.C. §§ 112(a)(1), 113(a)(1)(E), (J). \n186.  In their acting positions, Cuccinnelli, McAleenan, and Wolf performed functions \nor duties of such positions, as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 3348. The USCIS director’s “[f]unctions” \ninclude  establishing  policies  and  overseeing  the  administration  of  such  policies.  6  U.S.C. \n§ 271(a)(3)(A), (B), (D). The DHS secretary’s functions or duties include issuing regulations and \ndelegating the secretary’s functions to others. See 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(1), (e); 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3).  \n187.  When he adopted the October 2019 fee-waiver actions, Cuccinelli was performing \nthe role of acting USCIS director in violation of the FVRA. See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F. \nSupp. 3d 1, 29 (D.D.C. 2020).  \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 53 of 74\n188.  When he signed the 2020 Fee Proposal, McAleenan was performing the role of \nacting DHS secretary in violation of the HSA and the FVRA. At the time, the order of succession \napplicable under the HSA was reflected in Executive Order No. 13,753, 81 Fed. Reg. 90,677 (Dec. \n9, 2016), and McAleenan, the CBP commissioner, was not the next in line under that order. See \nGAO,  Homeland  Security,  File  B-331650,  at  4-9  (Aug.  14,  2020), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf. Also, by the time McAleenan signed the 2020 Fee \nProposal, the vacancy had been open for more than 210 days. The DHS secretary position had \nbecome vacant by April 10, 2019. \n189.  When he signed the Supplemental Proposal and the January 2020 comment-period \nextension, approved the 2020 Fee Rule, and made any delegation of signature authority to Mizelle, \nWolf was performing the role of acting DHS secretary in violation of the HSA and the FVRA. On \nNovember 8, 2019, McAleenan issued a document that purported to change the DHS secretary \norder of succession in a way that could have made Wolf the next in line to be the acting secretary. \nBut that change was invalid because McAleenan was not validly serving as acting secretary. See \nid. at 9-11. Also, when Wolf assumed the title of acting secretary, the vacancy had been open for \nmore than 210 days.  \n190.  When he signed the 2020 Fee Rule, Mizelle did not have authority to serve as acting \ngeneral counsel under the FVRA. The position had been vacant for more than 210 days.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 54 of 74\nV. IMPACT OF 2019 FEE-WAIVER ACTIONS AND 2020 FEE RULE ON PLAINTIFFS \nA. Harm to NWIRP \n(1) Harm Caused by October 2019 Fee-Waiver Actions \n191.  When NWIRP helps its direct-representation clients apply for USCIS benefits, it \nalso assists those clients with associated fee-waiver applications. In recent years, many NWIRP \ndirect-representation clients have sought waivers of USCIS filing fees. \n192.  Before USCIS’s October 2019 fee-waiver actions, NWIRP routinely prepared fee-\nwaiver applications based on clients’ receipt of means-tested benefits. In these cases, NWIRP \nwould advise a client receiving such benefits to bring documentation to his or her appointment. \nNWIRP staff could use this documentation to prepare a fee-waiver application in a matter of \nminutes. \n193.  NWIRP also routinely prepared successful fee-waiver applications without the \ndocumentation required by the October 2019 I-912 form, even for clients who were not receiving \nmeans-tested benefits. \n194.  Further, before USCIS adopted the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and \ninstructions, set a date for the 2011 Memorandum to expire, and revised its Policy Manual, NWIRP \nsubmitted some fee-waiver applications without the I-912 form. Also, in some cases, NWIRP \ncombined the fee-waiver applications for multiple members of the same family into one.  \n195.  By creating new documentation requirements, eliminating the most straightforward \nof the 2011 Memorandum’s application criteria, and creating additional uncertainty about how an \napplicant can successfully establish eligibility for a fee waiver, the October 2019 fee-waiver \nactions would make applying for fee waivers a more burdensome, time-consuming, and lengthy \nprocess, with a higher risk of denial, for individual applicants and for NWIRP, in serving its clients. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 55 of 74\n196.  The October 2019 I-912 form and its instructions, the expiration of the 2011 \nMemorandum, and the new Policy Manual sections thus impair NWIRP’s ability to assist clients \nwith immigration legal matters and implement other programs, and conflict with NWIRP’s \nmission. In multiple ways, NWIRP will devote scarce resources to counteracting the harmful \neffects of these agency actions.  \n197.  For instance, the October 2019 I-912 form and its instructions, the expiration of the \n2011 Memorandum, and the new Policy Manual sections will cause NWIRP to spend more time, \nper individual, assisting clients with fee waivers, if they go into effect.  \na.  NWIRP will have to spend substantially more time working with many of its fee-\nwaiver clients to gather, compile, or review additional documentation, and to re-\nsubmit applications if USCIS deems clients’ initial fee-waiver applications to be \ninsufficient. For example, NWIRP expects that, for the first time, it will routinely \nhave to assist clients in seeking and obtaining tax transcripts from the IRS. NWIRP \nexpects that helping clients obtain documents from the IRS could be particularly \ntime-consuming with its disabled or elderly clients or others who are likely to lack \naccess to the Internet, accounts in their name, or other requirements for obtaining \ndocuments from the IRS online.  \nb.  NWIRP will spend more time assessing fee-waiver clients’ tax situations due to the \nI-912 form’s new questions about tax filing. \nc.  NWIRP will also spend extra time counseling clients about fee waivers because of \nthe additional uncertainty about how to establish eligibility for a fee waiver, \nwhether individuals will need to resubmit fee-waiver applications with additional \ndocuments, and the timeline needed for achieving a favorable result.  \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 56 of 74\n198.  Increasing the time required to assist clients with fee-waiver applications and \ncounsel clients on fee-waiver issues will mean that NWIRP must divert resources from serving \nother clients. As a result, NWIRP will not able to serve as many clients as it could previously.  \n199.  If the October 2019 fee-waiver actions go into effect, NWIRP will also divert \nresources to address the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions, the \nexpiration of the 2011 Memorandum, and the new Policy Manual sections by advancing the \napplication fees of certain clients who are facing urgent immigration deadlines, who are unable to \nproceed with their USCIS applications if they must pay application fees, and for whom NWIRP is \nnow less certain whether USCIS will grant a fee waiver in time, due to the extra time required to \ncompile an application under the revised fee-waiver standard, the uncertainty regarding USCIS’s \ntimeline for processing applications under the new standard, and the lack of clarity about what \napplicants must do to satisfy the new standard.  \n200.  NWIRP will additionally address the harm caused by the October 2019 fee-waiver \nactions by devoting time to modifying its community-education and training materials. Though \nNWIRP’s training and outreach efforts are currently limited by the coronavirus pandemic, as \nNWIRP prepares for more limited trainings during the pandemic and further training and outreach \nas the pandemic subsides, NWIRP will need to adjust its materials not only to describe the new \nagency actions and their importance, but also, in the future, to address complications that arise in \nthe agency’s application of them. \n(2) Harm Caused by 2020 Fee Rule \n201.  The 2020 Fee Rule will make it more difficult to NWIRP to serve its clients, and \nthus advance its mission, in several ways.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 57 of 74\n202.  The 2020 Fee Rule will make understanding and assisting clients in applying for \nfee waivers a more burdensome, time-consuming, and lengthy process for NWIRP. To help clients \napply for fee waivers under the new rule, NWIRP will have to spend more time working with \nmany of those clients to gather, compile, or review the required documentation and forms. For \ninstance, helping clients obtain and review a tax transcript, or similar IRS documents, can alone \ntake more time than submitting an application under the 2011 Memorandum and related USCIS \npractice. Many NWIRP clients will only be able to obtain and interpret these documents with \nNWIRP’s help. NWIRP will have to spend more time completing individual forms for every \napplicant, instead of combining family members’ related forms into one. Additionally, when \nclients seek to use the 2020 Fee Rule’s alternative documentation requirements, NWIRP will have \nto spend more time documenting clients’ circumstances and helping clients obtain any alternative \ndocumentation.  Because  of  the  risk  that  USCIS  might  apply  the  alternative  documentation \nrequirements in unexpected ways, these requirements may also mean that NWIRP has to spend \ntime re-submitting applications after initial denials.  \n203.  The 2020 Fee Rule will make it harder for NWIRP to serve clients who are not \neligible for fee waivers. Because of new restrictions on fee waiver availability and increased fees, \nNWIRP expects that more of its potential clients will face fees that they cannot afford to pay at the \ntime they seek assistance. The 2020 Fee Rule will thus make it more difficult for NWIRP to \nidentify clients that NWIRP is able serve and then help such clients apply for immigration benefits. \nFor instance: \na.  In order to proceed with their applications, more clients than before will need \nNWIRP’s help in identifying options for gathering the funds to pay the necessary \nfees. NWIRP will spend more time providing such assistance.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 58 of 74\nb.  More clients will need more time to obtain the necessary funds. When a client needs \nmore time to come up with the necessary funds, NWIRP puts the client’s case file \non hold until the client has the funds to apply. This process, of putting a case on \nhold and restarting, can increase the amount of work required for NWIRP to serve \na client. \nc.  Among the potential clients who seek NWIRP’s assistance, a greater portion will \nhave no foreseeable way to pay the required fee. NWIRP will have to devote more \ntime to assessing the circumstances of potential clients whom NWIRP ultimately is \nunable to help, and then identifying other individuals whom NWIRP can help \ninstead.  \nd.  Because the 2020 Fee Rule imposes a surcharge for filing paper-based applications, \nwhen online options are available, NWIRP will spend additional effort to help \nclients file applications online when they might otherwise have used paper forms. \nFor clients who do not have access to technology or are facing other life challenges \nthat limit their ability to use online forms, NWIRP will have to spend more time \nhelping clients create email accounts or keep track of such accounts. \ne.  NWIRP will use available resources to advance certain clients’ application fees. \nThe 2020 Fee Rule’s fee increases mean that when NWIRP assists clients in this \nway, NWIRP will often have to pay more, per client. Thus, available NWIRP funds \nwill help fewer individuals. \n204.  The 2020 Fee Rule will require NWIRP to spend additional time with clients and \npotential clients and spend more money for individual fees that it advances.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 59 of 74\n205.  NWIRP will additionally address the harm caused by the 2020 Fee Rule by \ndevoting time to modifying its community-education and training materials. Though NWIRP’s \ntraining and outreach efforts are currently limited by the coronavirus pandemic, as NWIRP \nprepares for more limited trainings during the pandemic and further training and outreach as the \npandemic subsides, NWIRP will need to adjust its materials not only to describe the new rule and \nits  importance,  but  also,  in  the  future,  to  address  complications  that  arise  in  the  agency’s \napplication of it. \n206.  The uses of NWIRP resources described above mean that NWIRP will divert time \nand money from helping other clients. NWIRP will not be able to advance the fees of as many \nclients as it could previously and will not be able to serve as many clients as it could previously. \nB. Harm to Ayuda \n207.  Many Ayuda clients cannot afford to pay immigration filing fees. Ayuda often helps \neligible clients apply for USCIS fee waivers. Also, since 2019, Ayuda has sought and received \ngrant funds that it uses to pay the USCIS fees of certain clients who would face legal prejudice or \nother harm if they sought a fee waiver and were denied. \n208.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions will hamper Ayuda’s ability to serve its \nclients, and thus advance its mission, in multiple ways. First, these actions will make it more time-\nconsuming for Ayuda to help clients seeking fee waivers. Under current law and USCIS practice, \nAyuda generally helps clients apply for fee waivers based on a single document: proof of receipt \nmeans-tested benefits, a copy of a tax return, or a declaration. In many cases, clients are able to \nlocate the required documents easily and bring them to Ayuda during a meeting that is early in the \npreparation of the case. If the October 2019 fee-waiver actions go into effect, many fee-waiver \nclients  will  need  more  help  from  Ayuda  in  identifying,  obtaining,  and  reviewing  required \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 60 of 74\ndocuments. The documents required by the new standard are not generally familiar to Ayuda \nclients and can vary based on the circumstances of the client and the client’s household members. \nAyuda will need to spend more time assessing which documents are required and helping clients \ngather the required IRS and other documents. Additionally, because the October 2019 fee-waiver \nactions will make the fee-waiver application process lengthier and increase the risk of unexpected \ndenials, a greater portion of Ayuda’s fee waiver clients will need help from Ayuda in assessing \ntheir options, and re-applying, if their fee-waiver applications are denied, or receiving grant funds \nto pay their USCIS fees. \n209.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions will require Ayuda to spend more time and \nmoney helping individual fee-waiver clients. Ayuda’s time will be diverted from helping other \nclients, and its grant funds will be diverted from other uses, including other clients’ litigation \nexpenses. \n210.  The 2020 Fee Rule will also hamper Ayuda’s ability to serve its clients and thus \nadvance its mission.  \n211.  For Ayuda clients eligible for fee waivers under the 2020 Fee Rule, the rule’s \ndocumentation requirements will make Ayuda’s work more difficult and resource-consuming in \nways similar to the October 2019 fee-waiver actions. \n212.  The 2020 Fee Rule will also make it harder for Ayuda to serve clients who are \nineligible for fee waivers. Ayuda will continue paying some clients’ fees, but that assistance will \noften cost more, due to the fee increases in the 2020 Fee Rule. As a result, Ayuda’s existing grant \nfunds will not help as many clients as they could before. Additionally, when Ayuda cannot provide \ngrant funds to help clients, Ayuda will more frequently need to wait to proceed with filing clients’ \napplications until they have the funds to pay the applicable fees. Waiting for clients to find the \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 61 of 74\nfunds to pay immigration fees can require more work from Ayuda. For instance, Ayuda staff may \nhave to help clients re-do documentation when the client is ready to file. Additionally, among the \npotential clients who seek Ayuda’s assistance, a greater portion will have no foreseeable way to \npay the required immigration fee. Because Ayuda will not be able to provide grant funds to all \nsuch clients, Ayuda will have to devote more time to assessing the circumstances of potential \nclients whom Ayuda ultimately is unable to help, and then identifying other individuals whom \nAyuda can help instead. \n213.  The 2020 Fee Rule’s surcharge for filing paper-based applications will also make \nit harder for Ayuda to serve its clients. In order to enable clients to avoid the surcharge, Ayuda \nwill spend additional effort helping clients file applications online when they might otherwise have \nused paper forms. Because not all Ayuda clients have access to or are comfortable with technology, \nAyuda will have to spend more time helping clients create email accounts or keep track of those \naccounts. \n214.  As a result of the 2020 Fee Rule, Ayuda will have to spend additional time and \nmoney helping individual clients and, therefore, divert its time and resources from other clients. \nAyuda will be prevented from helping as many new clients as it would otherwise be able to help.  \n215.  Because of the  harm  caused by the  2020  Fee Rule,  Ayuda  will also  devote \nadditional time to seeking—and monitoring the use of—grant funds that it can use to pay Ayuda \nclients’ immigration fees. This work will divert Ayuda resources from other efforts.  \n216.  The 2020 Fee Rule will additionally cause Ayuda to lose revenue, while increasing \nthe costs of serving individual clients. Ayuda charges below-cost fees to some clients, but does not \nturn away clients unable to pay Ayuda’s fee. Because of the 2020 Fee Rule’s fee increases and \nfee-waiver restrictions, fewer clients will be able to pay any Ayuda fee. At the same time, the costs \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 62 of 74\nof representing clients under Ayuda’s low bono fee model will increase, due to the increased work \nthat the 2020 Fee Rule will cause.  \nC. Harm to CASA \n217.  CASA’s members will face increased fees due to the 2020 Fee Rule. \n218.   The October 2019 fee-waiver actions and 2020 Fee Rule will also make it more \ndifficult for CASA to help members through its naturalization program.  \n219.  Through its naturalization program, CASA mostly serves low-wage workers who \nstruggle to pay for basic necessities and have limited English proficiency. Under current law, many \nare eligible for a fee waiver or a reduced naturalization fee. CASA helps eligible individuals \nunderstand the requirements for seeking a fee waiver or reduced fee. Most frequently, eligible \nCASA members are able to support their fee waiver or reduced-fee applications with proof that \nthey receive means-tested benefits or copies of their tax returns, not tax transcripts. \n220.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions will require more CASA members to support \ntheir fee-waiver applications with tax transcripts or other documents from the IRS, for themselves \nand their household members. These documents are not ones that CASA members tend to have at \ntheir homes; in seeking CASA’s assistance, members will expect and need CASA’s help obtaining \nthem. Helping clients identify and gather the required documentation will require more effort from \nCASA. For instance, CASA staff will spend additional time guiding individuals through the IRS’s \nonline system for seeking tax transcripts or helping them seek such forms at an IRS office. The \ntime required to help individuals in this way will take away from CASA’s ability to serve other \nclients and mean that, with existing staff, it cannot serve as many individuals as it would otherwise. \n221.  The 2020 Fee Rule will also make it more difficult for CASA to serve members \nand accomplish its mission. To the extent that individuals in CASA’s naturalization program are \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 63 of 74\nstill eligible for fee-waivers under the new rule, the 2020 Fee Rule will require CASA to spend \nmore time helping members obtain required documents, such as tax transcripts or other required \ndocuments from the IRS. \n222.  The 2020 Fee Rule will also require CASA to spend more time helping individuals \nwho are not eligible for fee waivers. \n223.  Currently, when members are ineligible for fee waivers and reduced fees, CASA \nhelps those individuals identify other strategies for funding their naturalization applications. \nMembers who live in a certain county may be eligible for scholarship funds. If members are \nineligible for those funds, CASA informs them about an available credit union loan, counsels them \non the consequences of taking out a loan, and, if they are interested, helps them apply and provides \ncontinuing support. When individuals are unable to afford USCIS naturalization fees and are \nineligible for, or not interested in, the scholarship or the loan, CASA provides additional one-on-\none financial counseling to help the members identify ways to afford the USCIS fees.  \n224.  The  2020  Fee  Rule  means  that  a  smaller  fraction  of  members  in  CASA’s \nnaturalization program will be eligible for fee waivers. As a result, more members will require \nCASA’s help obtaining and using a credit union loan or identifying other options through financial \ncounseling. This type of assistance generally requires more of CASA’s time than helping people \napply for fee waivers. Because the 2020 Fee Rule means that CASA will spend more time on this \ntype of assistance, CASA will divert  resources from serving other members or from other \nactivities. Absent more resources, CASA will not be able to help as many people naturalize (and \ntherefore be eligible to vote), as it could before. \n225.  The 2020 Fee Rule will also cause CASA to lose revenue. CASA charges a small \nfee for its naturalization program, which it waives for individuals who demonstrate significant \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 64 of 74\nfinancial hardship. Due to the 2020 Fee Rule, CASA will not be able to serve as many members \nthrough its naturalization program as it could before. Additionally, because the 2020 Fee Rule \nimposes substantial new financial burdens on already low-income members, CASA anticipates \nthat a greater portion of the members in its naturalization program will need the CASA fee waived. \nAs a result of these circumstances, CASA will lose revenue. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Failure to observe required procedure—Revisions to I-912 form and instructions) \n \n226.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency actions \ntaken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n227.  The October 2019 changes to the I-912 form and its instructions constitute a \nsubstantive and legislative rule that was subject to the notice-and-comment requirements of the \nAPA, id. § 553. \n228.  USCIS did not conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking before changing the I-912 \nform and its instructions. \n229.  By  failing  to  engage  in  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  before  adopting  the \nOctober 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions, USCIS failed to observe procedures \nrequired by law, in contravention of the APA. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nor not in accordance with law—Revisions to I-912 form and instructions)  \n \n230.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n231.  USCIS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the October 2019 revisions to \nthe I-912 form and instructions. It has provided shifting, incomplete, and illogical explanations of \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 65 of 74\nthe  changes;  asserted  justifications  that  are  unsupported  by  data,  internally  inconsistent, \nconclusory, or in contradiction of the record or the law; made assertions about matters outside its \nexpertise; provided a certification to OMB that is not supported by the record; and failed to \nrationally connect the choices made to facts found. \n232.  In issuing the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and instructions, USCIS \nrelied on inappropriate and irrelevant factors, including factors unrelated to individuals’ ability to \npay required fees. \n233.  In issuing the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and instructions, USCIS \nfailed to engage with the information and arguments in the record and failed to consider important \naspects of the problem. \n234.  USCIS  did  not  identify  the  facts  and  circumstances  underlying  the  2011 \nMemorandum or explain whether or why it disregarded them. \n235.  USCIS’s October 2019 I-912 form and its instructions omit directions that USCIS \nidentified separately, in its Policy Manual, and did not explain. \n236.  USCIS failed to consider significant and obvious alternatives to the October 2019 \nrevisions to the I-912 form and instructions.  \n237.  The October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion, in contravention of the APA.  \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nor not in accordance with law—Expiration of 2011 Memorandum) \n \n238.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 66 of 74\n239.  USCIS provided no reasons for setting the 2011 Memorandum to expire, other than \nthose offered to justify the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions. Those \nreasons are incomplete, unsupported, and otherwise inadequate, as described above. \n240.  USCIS’s  establishment  of  an  expiration  date  for  the  2011  Memorandum  is \narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, in contravention of the APA. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nor not in accordance with law—Policy Manual revisions) \n \n241.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n242.  USCIS provided no reasons for issuing new sections of its Policy Manual, to \nsupersede sections in the Adjudicator’s Field Manual and related material, other than those offered \nto justify the October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions. Those reasons are \nincomplete, unsupported, and otherwise inadequate, as described above. \n243.  The Policy Manual’s new chapter 4 incorrectly and unreasonably interprets 8 \nU.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), to the extent that such interpretation attempts to narrow individuals’ ability to \nseek fee waivers for certain filings. \n244.  USCIS’s new Policy Manual sections, regarding fees and fee waivers, are arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, in contravention of the \nAPA. \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 67 of 74\nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,  \nnot in accordance with the law, or taken without  \nobservance of required procedure—Information collection revisions) \n \n245.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), or taken “without observance of procedure required by law,” id. § 706(2)(D). \n246.  USCIS did not comply with the PRA requirement that, before revising its fee-\nwaiver information-collection, it first complete a multi-factor review that included an “objectively \nsupported estimate of burden,” 5 C.F.R. § 1320.8(a)(4); “[a] plan for the efficient and effective \nmanagement and use of the information to be collected, including necessary resources,” id. \n§ 1320.8(a)(7); and other elements, id. § 1320.8(a). See generally id. § 1320.5(a)(1)(i).  \n247.  Because  they  were  inaccurate  and  incomplete,  the  agency’s  Federal  Register \nnotices did not satisfy the PRA requirement for USCIS to publish two Federal Register notices \nbefore  revising  its  fee-waiver  information-collection.  See  44  U.S.C.  §§ 3506(c)(2)(A), \n3507(a)(1)(D); 5 C.F.R. §§ 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), 1320.8(d)(1), 1320.10(a). \n248.  USCIS did not comply with the PRA requirement that, to obtain OMB approval for \nthe October 2019 revisions to its fee-waiver information-collection, it “demonstrate that it has \ntaken every reasonable step to ensure that the proposed collection of information” “[i]s the least \nburdensome necessary,” “[h]as practical utility,” has not “shift[ed] disproportionate costs or \nburdens onto the public” in “seek[ing] to minimize the cost to [USCIS],” and meets other \nstandards, 5 C.F.R. § 1320.5(d)(1), as well as demonstrate in its OMB submission that certain \ncharacteristics of the collection, if present, satisfy a “substantial need” or a statutory requirement, \nid. § 1320.5(d)(2).  \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 68 of 74\n249.  USCIS  failed  to  satisfy  the  PRA  requirement  that  it  provide  a  certification, \nsupported by the record, that its fee-waiver information-collection, as revised, satisfies certain \nrequirements. See id. § 1320.9; see also 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(3); 5 C.F.R. § 1320.5(a)(1)(iii)(A).  \n250.  In adopting the October 2019 revisions to its fee-waiver information-collection, \nUSCIS failed to observe procedures required by law, or took agency action that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the PRA, in contravention of the APA. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is not in accordance with the INA and regulation  \n— Revisions to I-912 form and instructions)  \n \n251.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \nthat is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n252.  The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), requires DHS to “permit” immigrants “to apply” \nfor the waiver of “any fees” associated with certain applications related to humanitarian forms of \nprotection.  \n253.  Under DHS regulation, an individual “unable to pay” a USCIS fee is eligible for a \nwaiver if the waiver is consistent with the benefit sought and the applicant submits a written request \n“stat[ing] the person’s belief that he or she is entitled to or deserving of the benefit requested, the \nreasons for his or her inability to pay, and evidence to support the reasons indicated.” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 103.7(c)(1), (2). \n254.  The  October  2019  revisions  to  the  fee-waiver  form  and  instructions  require \napplicants, including those applying under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), to submit specified types of \ndocumentation that are not available to some otherwise-eligible immigrants. \n255.  The October 2019 revisions to the I-912 form and its instructions violate the INA, \n8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), and DHS regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c), in contravention of the APA. \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 69 of 74\nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Failure to observe required procedure—2020 Fee Rule) \n256.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency actions \ntaken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n257.  Under the APA’s requirements for notice-and-comment rulemaking, an agency \nmust provide notice of the proposed rule, including the “legal authority under which the rule is \nproposed” and “the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and \nissues  involved.”  Id.  § 553(b)(2),  (3).  The  agency  also  must  “give  interested  persons  an \nopportunity to participate through submission of written data, views, or arguments.” Id. § 553(c). \n258.  DHS did not explain or make available many aspects of the reasoning, data, \nassumptions, models, studies, or other material on which the Fee Proposal relied. The preamble to \nthe Fee Proposal did not accurately describe all of the proposed regulatory text. \n259.  Interested  parties  could  not  comment  meaningfully  on  the  Fee  Proposal, \nSupplemental Proposal, and supporting material. \n260.  The 2020 Fee Rule included new provisions, data, and rationales that were not \ndiscussed in the Fee Proposal and that interested parties could not have anticipated. \n261.  By  failing  to  comply  with  the  APA’s  notice-and-comment  rulemaking \nrequirements in adopting the 2020 Fee Rule, DHS failed to observe procedures required by law, \nin contravention of the APA.  \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is not in accordance with the INA—2020 Fee Rule)  \n \n262.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \nthat is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 70 of 74\n263.  Under the INA, “fees for providing adjudication and naturalization services may be \nset at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such services, including the \ncosts of similar services provided without charge to asylum applicants or other immigrants,” as \nwell as “any additional costs associated with the administration of the fees collected.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1356(m).  \n264.  The 2020 Fee Rule is not in accordance with the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m), because \nit sets fees at a level intended to recover costs other than those of “providing adjudication and \nnaturalization services” or “the administration of the fees collected.”  \n265.  The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7), requires DHS to “permit” immigrants “to apply \nfor a waiver of any fees associated with” certain applications related to humanitarian forms of \nprotection.  \n266.  The 2020 Fee Rule requires that immigrants applying for waivers of the fees \ncovered by section 1255(l)(7) submit specified types of documentation that are not available to \nsome otherwise-eligible immigrants. By thus prohibiting certain applicants from applying, the \n2020 Fee Rule violates 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7).  \n267.  The INA states that individuals must receive certain immigration benefits if they \nsatisfy certain listed criteria, which do not include any  measure of an applicant’s financial \ncircumstances. These provisions include: 8 U.S.C. §§ 1186a(c)(3) (removal on conditions for \nresidence) and 1452(a) (certificate of citizenship).  \n268.  The 2020 Fee Rule violates the INA by barring applicants who are unable to pay \nrequired fees from applying for mandatory benefits whose criteria do not include any measure of \napplicants’ financial circumstances.  \n269.  The 2020 Fee Rule is not in accordance with the INA, in contravention of the APA. \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 71 of 74\nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is arbitrary and capricious—2020 Fee Rule)  \n \n270.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n271.  DHS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the 2020 Fee Rule. For instance, \nDHS based the rule on unreasonable, inaccurate, and unexplained estimates of its budget needs, \nfiling volumes, USCIS revenue, and other key figures. It did not describe all the operations whose \ncosts it sought to cover or why they fell within the scope of DHS’s authority to charge fees. DHS \nconsidered inappropriate factors; failed to engage with information and arguments in the record; \nrelied  on  internally  inconsistent,  illogical,  unsupported,  or  conclusory  justifications;  made \nassertions that were contradicted by data in the record; and failed to explain changes in position. \nIt also failed to consider the harm its rule will cause and other important aspects of the problem; \nand failed to consider alternatives or explain its rejection of them. \n272.  To the extent DHS’s preamble sought to interpret the scope of the new fee-waiver \nregulation by listing all forms that could be eligible for such waivers, that interpretation excluded \nat least one eligible form and is contrary to the regulation. \n273.  The 2020 Fee Rule is arbitrary and capricious, in contravention of the APA.  \nTENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Agency action that is in excess of authority under  \nthe FVRA and HSA, or without observance of procedure required by law \n—2020 Fee Rule and October 2019 fee-waiver actions)  \n \n274.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), “in excess of statutory … authority,” id. \n706(2)(C), or “without observance of procedure required by law,” id. 706(2)(D).  \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 72 of 74\n275.  The FVRA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345-3349, and the HSA, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g), limit which \nindividuals may serve as acting officials within DHS and USCIS and the amount of time for which \nthey may do so. \n276.  The FVRA directs that an action taken by a person “in the performance of any \nfunction or duty of a vacant office” covered by FVRA provisions “shall have no force or effect” if \nthe action is taken by a person who is “not acting under” FVRA provisions. Id. § 3348(d)(1). \n277.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions were adopted by Cuccinelli while he was \npurporting to serve as acting USCIS director, in violation of the FVRA. These actions constitute \n“function[s] or dut[ies]” of the applicable “vacant office,” under the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1). \n278.  The 2020 Fee Rule was adopted through a series of actions, including issuance of \nthe Fee Proposal and approval of the final rule, that were taken by individuals while they were \npurporting to serve as acting DHS officials, in violation of the FVRA and the HSA. These actions \nconstitute “function[s] or dut[ies]” of the applicable “vacant office,” under the FVRA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 3348(d)(1). \n279.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions and the 2020 Fee Rule have no force or effect, \nunder the FVRA, and  were  adopted in  violation of the law, without  observance of proper \nprocedure, and in excess of USCIS’s and DHS’s statutory authority, in contravention of the APA.  \nELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Non-statutory review of ultra vires action—2020 Fee Rule and \nOctober 2019 fee-waiver actions) \n \n280.  Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official \naction that is ultra vires. \n281.  The FVRA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345-3349, and the HSA, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g), limit which \nindividuals may serve as acting officials within DHS and USCIS and the amount of time for which \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 45   Filed 08/29/20   Page 73 of 74\nthey may do so. \n282.  The FVRA directs that an action taken by a person “in the performance of any \nfunction or duty of a vacant office” covered by FVRA provisions “shall have no force or effect” if \nthe action is taken by a person who is “not acting under” FVRA provisions. Id. § 3348(d)(1). \n283.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions were adopted by Cuccinelli while he was \npurporting to serve as acting USCIS director, in violation of the FVRA. These actions constitute \n“function[s] or dut[ies]” of the applicable “vacant office” under the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1). \n284.  The 2020 Fee Rule was adopted through a series of actions, including issuance of \nthe Fee Proposal and approval of the final rule, that were taken by individuals while they were \npurporting to serve as acting officials, in violation of the FVRA and the HSA. These actions \nconstitute “function[s] or dut[ies]” of the applicable “vacant office” under the FVRA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 3348(d)(1). \n285.  The October 2019 fee-waiver actions and the 2020 Fee Rule were ultra vires. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs requests that this Court: \nA.

Dkt. 50 at 14–15.  Many of these \nbenefits are of no small consequence to applicants; they include “naturalization, lawful \npermanent residence, employment authorization, humanitarian benefits, and other forms of legal \nstatus.”  Id. at 15.   \nThese benefits must be funded somehow, and DHS generally does so by charging fees for \nits services.  In recent years, however, its costs have outstripped the fees it collects.  See Dkt. 69-\n1 at 2; U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and Changes to Certain Other \nImmigration Benefit Request Requirements, 84 Fed. Reg. 62,280, 62,288 (Nov. 14, 2019) \n(“Proposed Rule”).  To address this shortfall and to make various policy changes, DHS proposed \na rule in November 2019 altering the fees it charges, shifting from an “ability-to-pay” to a \n“beneficiary-pays” model, charging a fee to apply for asylum for the first time, and reducing the \navailability of fee waivers for those of limited means.  Id. at 62,280, 62,298.  On August 3, 2020, \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 2 of 75\nthe Department finalized that rule.  See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule \nand Changes to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements, 85 Fed. Reg. 46,788 \n(Aug. 3, 2020) (“Final Rule” or “Rule”).  The rule was set to take effect on October 2, 2020, id., \nbut was recently enjoined by the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia, Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr. v. Wolf, No. 20-cv-05883-JSW, 2020 WL 5798269 (Sept. \n29, 2020). \nPlaintiffs Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (“NWIRP”), Ayuda, Inc. (“Ayuda”), and \nCASA de Maryland, Inc. (“CASA”) seek a stay of implementation or enforcement of the Rule \npursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 705, or in the alternative, a \npreliminary injunction against implementation and enforcement of the Rule.  Dkt. 50 at 1.  \nDefendants USCIS, DHS, Chad F. Wolf in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli in his official capacity as Senior Official Performing the \nDuties of the USCIS Director and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security oppose Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.  Dkt. 69 at 12, 16.  The Court heard oral argument on September 24, 2020, and received \nsupplemental briefing on September 28, 29 and 30, 2020.  Dkts. 78–82. \nUpon consideration of the parties’ arguments and submissions, and for the reasons \nexplained below, the Court will GRANT Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory and Factual Background  \nDHS promulgated the Rule pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), \nwhich establishes the “Immigration Examinations Fee Account” (“IEFA”) for the receipt of fees \nthe Department charges.  8 U.S.C. § 1356(m).  The INA allows DHS to set “fees for providing \nadjudication and naturalization services . . . at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 3 of 75\nproviding all such services, including the costs of similar services provided without charge to \nasylum applicants or other immigrants.”  Id.  The INA further provides that “[s]uch fees may \nalso be set at a level that will recover any additional costs associated with the administration of \nthe fees collected.”  Id.    \nIn 2010, DHS conducted a comprehensive review of and revision to its fee structure.  See \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule, 75 Fed. Reg. 58,962 (Sept. 24, 2010) \n(“2010 Rule”); Dkt. 50 at 16.  The revised fee-schedule exempted “a range of humanitarian and \nprotective services, such as refugee and asylum processing,” from fees, explaining that “a large \npercentage of applicants would clearly be unable to pay” any fees.  2010 Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at \n58,973; Dkt. 50 at 16.  For other services to which fees did apply, DHS allowed waivers for \nindividuals “unable to pay the prescribed fee” if such a waiver would be “consistent with the \nstatus or benefit sought.”  8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c)(1); Dkt. 69 at 13–14.  \nTo determine what constitutes an inability to pay, USCIS issued a memorandum in 2011 \n(“2011 Memorandum”) that established a three-part test.  AR 43–50.  First, if the applicant \nreceived a “government ‘means-tested’ benefit, such as Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program benefits,” the applicant would be deemed ineligible to pay and the fee \nwaived.  AR 47; Dkt. 50 at 16–17.  Second, if the applicant received no means-tested benefit, \nUSCIS would consider whether the applicant’s income was less than or equal to 150% of the \nFederal Poverty Guidelines (“FPG”).  AR 48–49; Dkt. 50 at 17.  If so, the applicant was deemed \nunable to pay and the fee was waived.  Finally, if neither of the first two prongs applied, USCIS \nwould consider whether the individual was otherwise “suffering financial hardship” and, if so, \nwaive the fee.  AR 49.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 4 of 75\nThe 2011 Memorandum also addressed how applicants could show that they satisfied \nthese tests.  The approach was a flexible one.  Although USCIS created an official form for \napplicants to request fee waivers, it explained that use of the form was not mandatory.  AR 46–\n47.  Although the form identified certain types of documentation accepted as proof of inability to \npay, the Memorandum recognized that other forms of documentation could accompany the \nwaiver request, including pay statements, statements from employers, and tax returns.  AR 48. \nIn 2016, DHS issued another comprehensive revision to its fees, retaining the 2010 fee \nwaivers and exemptions and capping increases to naturalization, employment authorization, and \nother fees, which the Department deemed “overly burdensome on applicants, petitioners, and \nrequestors if set at the recommended [financial] model output levels.”  U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services Fee Schedule, 81 Fed. Reg. 73,292, 73,297, 73,307–08 (Oct. 24, 2016) \n(“2016 Rule”).  DHS also “created a reduced fee for low-income naturalization applicants” with \nfamily incomes greater than 150%, but less than 200%, of the FPG.  Id. at 73,326; Dkt. 50 at 17.  \nThe Department created this reduced fee to “ensure that those who have worked hard to become \neligible for naturalization are not limited by their economic means.”  2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at \n73,326. \nIn October 2019, USCIS revised the form and instructions governing fee waivers (as well \nas a related policy manual) in a manner that abandoned the 2011 Memorandum, narrowed \neligibility for fee waivers, and imposed new hurdles to obtaining waivers.  Dkt. 11-2; AR 484.  \nThe agency restricted fee waivers to those who can demonstrate that their “documented annual \nhousehold income” was at or below 150% of the FPG or can establish “financial hardship \nincluding, but not limited to, medical expenses of family members, unemployment, eviction, \nvictimization, and homelessness.”  Dkt. 11-2 at 14.  The new standards also eliminated an \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 5 of 75\napplicant’s option of demonstrating inability to pay based on the receipt of means-tested benefits, \nmandated use of the USCIS form, and imposed new evidentiary requirements.  AR 484.  Before \nthe new standards took effect, however, the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof California preliminarily enjoined the changes on the ground that the Department failed to \nconduct notice-and-comment rulemaking.  City of Seattle v. DHS, No. 3:19-cv-7151-MMC (N.D. \nCal. Dec. 11, 2019); Dkt. 69 at 14; Dkt. 50 at 19 n.5.   \nMeanwhile, DHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in November 2019, proposing \na new fee schedule and further limiting the availability of free waivers.  See Proposed Rule, 84 \nFed. Reg. 62,280.  In response to the Proposed Rule, DHS received 43,108 comments, which the \nDepartment reviewed before issuing the Final Rule.  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,794.  The \n“vast majority of commenters opposed all or part of” the Rule, raising concerns, among other \nthings, about the effect the Rule would have on the availability of immigration benefits for low-\nincome immigrants and the demand for those benefits.  Id. at 46,795. \nThe Rule is designed to serve two purposes: (1) it makes “[f]ee schedule adjustments . . . \nnecessary to recover the full operating costs associated with administering the nation’s lawful \nimmigration system,” id. at 46,789; and (2) it shifts from an “ability-to-pay” model to a \n“beneficiary-pays” model, which “ensure[s] that those who benefit from immigration benefits \npay their fair share of costs,” id. at 46,795.  To serve these purposes, the Rule curtails the \navailability of fee waivers.  Id. at 46,806.  The Rule does not permit fee waivers unless “[t]here is \na statutory or regulatory provision allowing for fee waivers” or the applicant belongs to specific \nprotected groups.  Id. at 46,920 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 106.3).  Even with respect to this \nlimited class, moreover, the Rule permits fee waivers only if (a) the applicant’s annual gross \nhousehold income is less than or equal to 125% of FPG (amounting to $15,950 annually for a \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 6 of 75\nsingle person) and (b) the applicant submits the required USCIS form and accompanying \ndocuments.  Id. at 46,920; Dkt. 50 at 19; Dkt. 69 at 14–15.  Although the USCIS Director \nreserves discretion to waive fees “in whole or in part” in “an emergent circumstance, or if a \nmajor natural disaster has been declared,” he may not waive the 125% requirement or the \nrequirement that the applicant satisfactorily complete the USCIS fee-waiver-application form.  \nFinal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,920; Dkt. 69 at 15.  These regulations displace the 2011 \nMemorandum’s test for ability to pay, including the “means-tested” approach to fee-waivers, \nwhich Plaintiffs characterize as “the easiest, most reliable, and most common method for seeking \nfee waivers.”  Dkt. 50 at 18. \nRestricting fee waivers is not the only way in which the Rule seeks to raise additional \nrevenue and to shift to a beneficiary-pays model.  The Rule also increases some fees and imposes \nsome new fees.  Notably, the Rule almost doubles the fee for filing an application for \nnaturalization and eliminates the pre-existing reduced fee option for low-income applicants.  \nFinal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,792, 46,792 n.8.  For the first time, moreover, asylum seekers \nmust pay a non-waivable $50 application fee, and if they seek employment, they must pay a \n$550 application fee and $30 biometrics fee.  Id. at 46,808, 46,833, 46,851–52; Dkt. 50 at 20.  \nSurvivors of crime will now have to pay $1,485 to seek permission for their children or spouses \nto join or to stay with them in the United States, more than six times the current fee.  Dkt. 50 at \n20.  This is the most dramatic increase, but the Rule also increases an array of other fees.  See \nFinal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,791–92.  At the same time, as part of the shift to a beneficiary-\npays model, the Rule reduces some fees that previously set off revenue shortfalls resulting from \nfee waivers and from fees that did not reflect the full cost of the service provided.  See, e.g., id. at \n46,791, 46,838 (discussing decreases to fees for replacing lawful permanent residence cards). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 7 of 75\nB.  Procedural Background  \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project filed this action on October 31, 2019 to challenge a \nrange of DHS policy changes relating to fees and fee waivers.  Dkt. 1 (Complaint); Dkt. 9 (First \nAmended Complaint).  NWIRP moved for summary judgment in December 2019, Dkt. 11, and \nDefendants moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, cross-moved for summary judgment, Dkt. 25.   \nOn August 29, 2020, NWIRP, together with new parties Ayuda and CASA de Maryland, \nfiled a second amended and supplemental complaint.  Dkt. 45.  Approximately a month after the \nDepartment promulgated the Final Rule, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction or to stay \nimplementation of the Rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705.  Dkt. 50.  Defendants oppose both \nrequests.  Dkt. 69.   \nII.  ANALYSIS \nTo prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show [1] \n“‘that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and [4] that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.’”  Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. 863, 876 (2015) (quoting Winter \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  “The last two factors merge \nwhen the government is the opposing party.”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \nand Explosives, 920 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).   \nFor many years, the D.C. Circuit evaluated these factors on a “sliding scale.”  E.g., \nDavenport v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, AFL–CIO, 166 F.3d 356, 360–61 (D.C. Cir.1999).  It has \nread the Supreme Court's decision in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. at 20-24, however, “at least to suggest if not to hold” that plaintiffs face “a more demanding \nburden” under which “a likelihood of success is an independent, freestanding requirement for a \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 8 of 75\npreliminary injunction,” Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392–93 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quotation \nmarks omitted).  This issue remains the subject of some uncertainty in this Circuit.  See \nArchdiocese of Wash. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 897 F.3d 314, 334 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(“This court has not yet decided whether Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council . . . is \nproperly read to suggest a sliding scale approach to weighing the four factors is abandoned.” \n(cleaned up));  Am. Meat Inst. v. USDA, 746 F.3d 1065, 1074 (D.C. Cir. 2014), reinstated in \nrelevant part by 760 F.3d 18 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (en banc) (“[t]his circuit has repeatedly declined to \ntake sides ... on the question of whether likelihood of success on the merits is a freestanding \nthreshold requirement to issuance of a preliminary injunction”).  Nonetheless, it is clear that the \nplaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits is a “key issue [and] often the dispositive one” at \nthe preliminary injunction stage, Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dep't of \nHous. & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d 1078, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2011), and that, even if the sliding-scale \napproach survived Winter, “a plaintiff with a weak showing on the” likelihood-of-success factor \n“would have to show that all three of the other factors so much favor the [movants] that they \nneed only have raised a serious legal question on the merits.”  Am. Meat Inst., 746 F.3d at 1074 \n(quotation marks omitted). \n“On such conditions as may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable \ninjury,” the APA allows a reviewing court to “issue all necessary and appropriate process to \npostpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion \nof the review proceedings.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The standard of review for relief under 5 \nU.S.C. § 705 is the same as the standard of review for preliminary injunctions: “[E]ach is \ngoverned by the four-part preliminary injunction test applied in this Circuit.”  Sierra Club v. \nJackson, 833 F. Supp. 2d 11, 30 (D.D.C. 2012). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 9 of 75\nA.  Standing \nThe Court starts, as it must, with standing.  A plaintiff that is unlikely to prevail on the \nquestion of standing is unlikely to prevail on the merits and, accordingly, “is not entitled to a \npreliminary injunction.”  Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. \n2015); see also U.S. House of Representatives v. Mnuchin, No. 19-5176, 2020 WL 5739026, at \n*3 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 25, 2020).   \nArticle III of the Constitution limits “[t]he judicial power of the United States” to “Cases” \nand “Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, §§ 1–2.  “To state a case or controversy under Article \nIII, a plaintiff must establish standing,” Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, \n133 (2011), “the ‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of” which requires “‘the plaintiff [to] have \nsuffered an injury in fact’” that has a “‘causal connection’” to “the challenged conduct,” and that \ncan be “be ‘redressed by a favorable decision,’” Env’t Integrity Project v. McCarthy, 139 F. \nSupp. 3d 25, 36 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 \n(1992)).  When, as here, the plaintiff is an organization, it may assert standing on its own behalf \n(“organizational standing”) “or on behalf of [its] members (‘associational standing’).”  \nMcCarthy, 139 F. Supp. 3d at 36; see also O.A. v. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d 109, 142 (D.D.C. \n2019).   \n  “A plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating its standing at every stage of the \nlitigation,” California v. Trump, No. 19-960 (RDM), 2020 WL 1643858, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 2, \n2020), and must do so “with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages \nof the litigation,”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  As a result, to establish \nstanding at the preliminary injunction stage, a plaintiff “must show a ‘substantial likelihood’ of \nstanding.”  Food & Water Watch, 808 F.3d at 913.  When multiple plaintiffs pursue the same \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 10 of 75\nclaim, as long as one plaintiff has standing, the Court ‘“need not consider the standing of the \nother plaintiffs to raise that claim.’”  Bauer v. DeVos, 325 F. Supp. 3d 74, 88 (D.D.C. 2018) \n(quoting Mountain States Legal Found. v. Glickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 1996)); see \nalso Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017) (“At least one \nplaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.”). \n  Plaintiffs offer two theories of standing.  First, they assert that “they have established \nharm to their organizations” “on multiple grounds.”  Dkt. 77 at 47.  And second, they contend \nthat “CASA is likely to be able to assert membership [i.e., associational] standing” because it has \nsubmitted a declaration “describ[ing] a circumstance of one member who is facing a \nnaturalization fee that will now be much higher than it would be otherwise.”  Id. at 46:19–20; see \nalso Dkt. 50-3 at 9 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 30). \n1.  Organizational Standing   \nTo establish organizational standing, Plaintiffs “must make the same showing required of \nindividuals: an actual or threatened injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s \nallegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.”  Am. Soc. \nfor Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Feld Ent., Inc. (“ASPCA”), 659 F.3d 13, 24 (D.C. Cir. \n2011).  “It is not enough for the organization to show that its ‘mission has been compromised,’ \nFood & Water Watch, 808 F.3d at 919, or that it has experienced a ‘setback to its abstract social \ninterests,’ Equal Rights Ctr. [v. Post Props., Inc.], 633 F.3d [1136, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 2011)].”  \nPub. Citizen v. Trump, 297 F. Supp. 3d 6, 36 (D.D.C. 2018).  Rather, “[t]o establish \norganizational standing a party must show that it suffers” or will imminently suffer “a concrete \nand demonstrable injury to its activities, distinct from a mere setback to the organization’s \nabstract social interests . . . [and] the presence of a direct conflict between the defendant’s \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 11 of 75\nconduct and the organization’s mission.”  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. FAA, 892 F.3d 1249, 1255 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (internal citations, brackets, quotation marks, and emphasis omitted).   \nPlaintiffs contend that they have organizational “standing because [the] [R]ule makes the \noverall task of their work more difficult.”  Dkt. 77 at 44:4–6 (Tr. of Oral Arg.).  In Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, the Supreme Court held that a “concrete and demonstrable injury to [an] \norganization’s activities”—there, providing “counseling and referral services”—can support \nArticle III standing if the organization can show a “consequent drain on [its] resources” and \n“more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.”  455 U.S. 363, 379 \n(1982).  D.C. Circuit “case law, however, establishes two important limitations on the scope of \nstanding under Havens.”  ASPCA, 659 F.3d at 25.  First, the plaintiff “must show a ‘direct \nconflict between the defendant’s conduct and the organization’s mission.’”  Id. (quoting Nat’l \nTreasury Emps. Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1430 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  Second, the \nplaintiff must show that it has “used its resources to counteract [the asserted] harm.”  People for \nthe Ethical Treatment of Animals v. USDA, 797 F.3d 1087, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quotation \nmarks omitted).  That harm, moreover, cannot be “self-inflicted” by, for example, diverting \nresources to the “very suit” challenging the defendant’s conduct, ASPCA, 659 F.3d at 25, and \ncannot result from “expend[ing] resources to educate [the organization’s] members and others \nunless doing so subjects the organization to operational costs beyond those normally expended,” \nFood & Water Watch, 808 F.3d at 920 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  All three \nPlaintiffs have shown that they are likely to meet this burden. \nFirst, NWIRP has offered unrebutted evidence that the Rule directly conflicts with its \nmission of providing a broad array of legal services to low-income immigrants and will impose \nnew burdens and costs on the organization.  See generally Dkt. 50-1 (Barón 2d Decl.).  The \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 12 of 75\norganization’s Executive Director attests that the Rule will (1) “cause NWIRP clients to need \nmore help from NWIRP than they would otherwise [need] to prepare and submit fee waiver \napplications,” Dkt. 50-1 at 12 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 29); (2) cause NWIRP “to spend more time than \n[it] previously [spent] helping fee-waiver eligible clients seek and obtain IRS documents,” id. at \n13 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 32); (3) increase the risk that NWIRP must “spend additional time re-\nsubmitting fee-waiver applications,” id. at 14 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 33); (4) “cause NWIRP to spend \nadditional time preparing individual fee-waiver requests . . . for each client seeking a fee waiver, \nrather than combining family members’ related applications into one,” id. (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 34); \n(5) “hamper NWIRP’s work by restricting NWIRP’s ability to help clients seek fee waivers at all \n. . . [because] fewer than half of the NWIRP clients who would be eligible for fee waivers under \ncurrent law will be eligible for fee waivers of the [Final Rule],” id. at 15 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 36); \nand (6) “make it harder for NWIRP to help immigrants find other assistance, when NWIRP is \nunable to help . . . [because] the significant increase in fees that many immigrants will face [will \nmake] . . . referrals to fee-charging attorneys . . . far more difficult,” id. at 17 (Barón 2d \nDecl. ¶ 40).  These “additional demands,” NWIRP contends, “will divert NWIRP’s resources \nfrom other work and mean that NWIRP cannot serve as many clients as it would otherwise,” id. \nat 18 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 42); will increase the per-client cost that NWIRP incurs for providing \nmany types of assistance, id. (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 44); and will require that it both “triage client \nneeds even more so than normal” and “spend its emergency funds to advance fees for clients \nfacing urgent needs,” id. at 20 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 47).   \nPlaintiffs make a similar showing with respect to Ayuda’s standing.  Like NWIRP, \nAyuda provides legal services “to low-income immigrants seeking a wide range of immigration \nbenefits.”  Dkt. 50-2 at 2 (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 3–5).  According to the organization’s Legal Director, \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 13 of 75\n“[t]he [Final Rule] will make it more difficult for Ayuda to serve its clients in several ways.”  Id. \nat 6 (Cooper Decl. ¶ 20).  Ayuda staff will, for example, have to spend more time and resources \nhelping clients (1) “obtain the required documents [to] complete fee-waiver requests,” id. at 7 \n(Cooper Decl. ¶ 21); (2) complete fee-waiver applications, some of which will require “at least \ntwo meetings with the client . . . when, earlier, a single meeting might have sufficed,” id. at 8 \n(Cooper Decl. ¶ 21); and (3) “apply for immigration benefits[] when Ayuda grant funds are \nunavailable” because “during the period when a client is searching for funds, USCIS may change \nthe necessary forms or certain documentation may expire,” thereby requiring Ayuda to “re-do \n[clients’] applications or collect new documentation,” id. at 10 (Cooper Decl. ¶ 24).  Ayuda will \nalso have to “devote more time to assessing the circumstances of potential clients” to ensure that \nthey are able to pay the increased fees, thus lessening the time that Ayuda can spend helping \nclients obtain the immigration benefits they seek.  Id. at 11 (Cooper Decl. ¶ 25); see also id. at 12 \n(Cooper Decl. ¶ 28) (“[Ayuda] will also spend more time screening potential clients, whom it \nmay ultimately be unable to serve due to those individuals’ lack of funds . . . .”).  Finally, Ayuda \nasserts that it will lose revenue because its clients will need to “devote their limited resources to \npaying newly required or higher USCIS fees,” resulting in “fewer clients . . . able to pay any \nAyuda fee.”  Id. at 14 (Cooper Decl. ¶ 32); see also id. at 15 (Cooper Decl. ¶ 34) (“[B]ecause of \nthe new demands that the [Final Rule] puts on Ayuda’s staff’s time, Ayuda will have to turn \naway many other potential clients.”).   \nAlthough CASA is differently situated, Plaintiffs have shown that the Rule directly \nconflicts with its mission as well and is likely to impose new burdens and costs on the \norganization.  “CASA is a nonprofit, membership-based immigrant rights organization,” Dkt. 50-\n3 at 2 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 3), with “over 100,000 all-time members,” id. at 3 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 9), \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 14 of 75\nincluding “noncitizens, from countries around the world, with low incomes and limited financial \nmeans,” id. (Escobar Decl. ¶ 12), who will need assistance in seeking an array of USCIS \n“benefits in coming years,” id. 3 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 13).  According to the organization’s Chief of \nPrograms and Services, the Rule will make it more difficult, for example, for CASA “to help \nlawful permanent residents apply for naturalization” because (1) those seeking fee waivers will \nneed to “submit certain specified income documentation,” which will require CASA personnel to \noffer additional assistance to its members, and (2) others will no longer qualify for fee waivers, \nwhich will require CASA personnel to assist those members in “understanding and applying for” \nloans or in exploring other options.  Id. at 9–10 (Escobar Decl. ¶¶ 31–35).  “To respond to . . . \nthe [Final Rule], CASA personnel will provide more assistance to fee-waiver applicants and \nmore in-depth financial education services to many of [its] members participating in its \nnaturalization program.”  Id. at 12 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 38).  This increased strain on CASA’s \nresources will, in the estimation of its Chief of Programs and Services, limit CASA “to help[ing] \nabout 900 members complete the naturalization application process, compared to the 1,500 \nindividuals whom CASA helped seek naturalization last year.”  Id.  CASA’s Chief of Programs \nand Services further attests that the Rule “will cause CASA to lose revenue” because the \norganization “charges [its members] a program fee of $50, and slightly more if a legal \nconsultation is involved,” for “its naturalization program,” and it charges those “who are not yet \nCASA members” “a $35 membership fee.”  Id. at 13 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 41).  “CASA waives its \nfees when members demonstrate significant financial hardship.”  Id.  Consequently, the Rule will \n(1) require that it waive its membership fee in more cases and (2) reduce the number of \nindividuals the organization can assist, resulting in lost revenue that “could” amount to “tens of \nthousands of dollars per year.”  Id. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 15 of 75\n The injuries that Plaintiffs have identified are the type of “substantial, tangible costs” \nthat are cognizable for purposes of organizational standing.  O.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 142.  This \nis not a case in which an organization simply diverted “resources to litigation or to investigation \nin anticipation of litigation”—a “self-inflicted budgetary choice that cannot qualify as an injury \nin fact for purposes of standing.”  ASPCA, 659 F.3d at 25 (quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs \nhave not “manufacture[d] the injury necessary to maintain a suit from its expenditure of \nresources on that very suit.”  Nat’l Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. United States, 68 F.3d 1428, 1434 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (quotation marks omitted).  And, their injuries do not “arise[] from the effect of \nthe regulations on [their] lobbying activities” or any “pure issue-advocacy” on their part.  Ctr. for \nLaw & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Rather, as in Havens, \nDefendants’ actions “have perceptibly impaired [Plaintiffs’] ability to provide counseling and \n[application] services for low-and moderate-income [immigrants].”  Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at \n379.  “[T]here can be no question that the organization[s]” have shown that they are likely to \n“suffer[] injury in fact,” id., and that the Rule, if permitted to take effect, will directly conflict \nwith their missions, see Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 892 F.3d at 1255.   \nThe Court is also persuaded that, if the Rule is allowed to take effect, Plaintiffs will \n“use[] [their] resources to counteract th[eir] injuries.”  ASPCA, 659 F.3d at 25.  Plaintiffs have \nexplained in detail why they will need to spend greater time helping clients meet the Rule’s \ndemands, see, e.g., Dkt. 50-1 at 12–15, 17–18 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶¶ 28, 29, 32–34, 36, 42–43); \nDkt. 50-2 at 7–12 (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 21–28); Dkt. 50-3 at 9–11 (Escobar Decl. ¶¶ 31–33, 35), and \nhow it will affect their funding and costs, see, e.g., Dkt. 50-1 at 18–20 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶¶ 42–\n47); Dkt. 50-2 at 12–14 (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 28–32); Dkt. 50-3 at 13–14 (Escobar Decl. ¶¶ 40–41).  \nThese uncontested declarations establish that the Rule will require Plaintiffs “to use substantial \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 16 of 75\n‘resources to counteract th[eir] injur[ies].’”  O.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 143 (quoting ASPCA, 659 \nF.3d at 25).  “No more is required to establish standing under Havens.”  Id. \nAlthough Defendants do not address standing in their opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for \na preliminary injunction, they did raise standing in their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ first \namendment complaint, which challenged USCIS’s 2019 revisions to Form I-912 and the \naccompanying instructions.  Dkt. 25-1.  Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is \npremised exclusively on their challenge to the 2020 Final Rule, Dkt. 50, which Plaintiffs did not \nraise until they filed their second amended complaint, Dkt. 45.  But giving Defendants the \nbenefit of the doubt, and because the Court must, in any event, satisfy itself that Plaintiffs have \nstanding to seek a preliminary injunction, the Court will treat Defendants’ arguments respecting \nthe first amended complaint as though they were also raised in Defendants’ opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and as though they applied with equal force to the \ndistinct claims asserted in the second amended complaint. \nFramed in this manner, Defendants raise two challenges to Plaintiffs’ organizational \nstanding.  First, they contend that Plaintiffs’ allegations of organizational harm “are speculative \nand rely on the decisions of independent third parties.”  Dkt. 25-1 at 23 (capitalization altered).  \nDefendants note that (1) “while NWIRP may desire that its staff and volunteers spend more time \non some applicants because of the revised Form, nothing about the revisions requires they do \nso,” id. at 24; (2) “there are several steps [NWIRP] can, and presumably already does, use to \nreduce the time spent on an applicant,” id. at 26; and (3) the revisions to Form I-912 and the \naccompanying instructions (and, presumably, the 2020 Final Rule) will either negligibly impact \nor actually benefit Plaintiffs’ practices, id. at 26–27.  Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ \n“diversion-of-resources allegations relate only to expenditures on ordinary program costs, which \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 17 of 75\ncannot constitute an injury in fact.”  Id. at 28 (capitalization altered and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The Court is unpersuaded.  \nTo start, the Court is unconvinced that Plaintiffs’ harms are speculative.  It is true that \n“nothing about [USCIS’s actions] requires” Plaintiffs to spend more time on their clients’ \napplications.  Id. at 24 (emphasis added).  But the challenged laws need not themselves compel \nPlaintiffs into action; it is enough that they “perceptibl[y] impair[]” the organizations’ missions \nin a manner that makes their “overall task more difficult.”  Nat’l Treasury, 101 F.3d at 1429; see \nalso Equal Rights Ctr., 633 F.3d at 1140 (“[O]ur standing analysis [does not] depend on the \nvoluntariness or involuntariness of the plaintiffs’ expenditures.  Instead, we focus[] on whether \n[the plaintiffs] undertook the expenditures in response to, and to counteract, the effects of the \ndefendants’ alleged [unlawful acts] rather than in anticipation of litigation.”).  Defendants’ \ncontention that Plaintiffs can preemptively reduce the time spent on applications also misses the \nmark.  Dkt. 25-1 at 26–27.  They fail to offer any evidence controverting Plaintiffs’ declarations, \nnor do Defendants dispute that the Rule will require Plaintiffs to increase their efforts in at least \nsome respects.  Id.  Finally, Defendants’ contention that the new Form I-912 (and, presumably \nthe Rule) may benefit Plaintiffs because it will “reduce the number of rejected applications,” id. \nat 27, and “increase the agency’s efficiency and speed processing applications” is unsupported \nby any evidence that directly or convincingly controverts Plaintiffs’ declarations.  Plaintiffs have \nexplained in detail how the Rule will increase their workload in numerous respects.  Any \naspiration that the Rule might improve the efficiency of the administrative process for all \ninvolved fails to negate the Plaintiffs’ showing that their workloads will still increase because of \nthe greater difficulty of completing applications in the first instance under the new standards.  \nDkt. 11-1 at 9–10 (Barón Decl. ¶ 39); Dkt. 50-1 at 12–15, 17–18 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶¶ 28, 29, 32–\n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 18 of 75\n34, 36, 42–43); Dkt. 50-2 at 7–12 (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 21–28); Dkt. 50-3 at 9–11 (Escobar Decl. \n¶¶ 31–33, 35).   \nThe Court is also unpersuaded that Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries merely constitute \n“ordinary program costs, which cannot constitute an injury in fact.”  Dkt. 25-1 at 28 \n(capitalization altered and quotation marks omitted).  The principal decision on which \nDefendants rely in their motion to dismiss the first amended complaint, National Taxpayers \nUnion v. United States, held that “a nonprofit organization formed to promote fair, responsible, \nand legal revenue-raising practices by the United States government” did not have standing to \nchallenge a provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 setting tax rates.  68 \nF.3d 1428, 1430, 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  The court reached that conclusion because the \nprovision did not “perceptibly impair[]” the organization “from pursuing its true purpose of \nmonitoring the government’s revenue practices” and, instead, merely required that it expend \n“operational costs . . . normally [associated with] review[ing], challeng[ing], and educat[ing] the \npublic about revenue-related legislation.”  68 F.3d at 1434.  Those “ordinary program costs,” the \ncourt concluded, could not be “convert[ed] . . . into an injury in fact.”  Id.  Here, unlike in \nNational Taxpayers Union, Plaintiffs have identified “perceptible” burdens that will “impair” \ntheir ability to “pursue” their “purpose[s]” if the Rule takes effect.  These burdens are of the type \nnecessary to establish Havens standing.  \nThat leaves causation and redressability.  Having concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed in establishing a cognizable injury, the two remaining Lujan factors are easily satisfied.  \nAs to causation, Plaintiffs have established that their injuries are fairly traceable to the Rule; it is \nthe Rule that will increase the costs of seeking the immigration benefits at issue and that will \nmake it more difficult for low-income individuals (including Plaintiffs’ clients and members) to \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 19 of 75\nqualify for those benefits, and Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries are the product of those changes.  As to \nredressability, the relief Plaintiffs seek would eliminate (or postpone) the Rule and the \ncorresponding injuries that Plaintiffs assert.  Dkt. 45 at 73–74.   \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiff have shown that they are likely to \nestablish that they have organizational standing. \n2.  Associational Standing \nPlaintiffs also assert that CASA has associational standing.  CASA has submitted a \ndeclaration “describ[ing] a circumstance of one member who is facing a naturalization fee that \nwill now be much higher than it would be otherwise.”  Dkt. 77 at 46; see also Dkt. 50-3 at 9 \n(Escobar Decl. ¶ 30).  “To establish associational standing, an organization must demonstrate \nthat (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it \nseeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor \nthe relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  McCarthy, \n139 F. Supp. 3d at 38 (quotation marks omitted); see also Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, \n667 F.3d 6, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2011).   \nCASA asserts associational standing based on the following averment from its Chief of \nPrograms and Services: \n[O]ne member has informed CASA that she had been intending to apply for \nnaturalization  in  December  2020,  when  she  believes  she  will  become \neligible to naturalize, with an exemption from the English test requirements.  \nThe English test is not required of individuals who are above a certain age \nand have held lawful permanent residence for a certain period of time.  That \nmember will face a fee of $1,170 for a paper application or $1,160 for an \nonline application, which is higher than what she would have to pay under \ncurrent law.  Given her financial circumstances, the member does not know \nwhether she will be able to afford the fee at that time, and may have to delay \nher application further. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 20 of 75\nDkt. 50-3 at 9 (Escobar Decl. ¶ 30).  The Court is unpersuaded that this isolated averment is \nsufficient to establish associational standing.   \nThe D.C. Circuit has repeatedly opined that “it is not enough” for a plaintiff asserting \nassociational standing “to aver that unidentified members have been injured.”  Chamber of \nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 \nU.S. 488, 496–500 (2009)).  “Rather, the [plaintiff] must specifically ‘identify members who \nhave suffered the requisite harm.’”  Id. at 200–01 (quoting Am. Chemistry Council v. Dep’t of \nTransp., 468 F.3d 810, 815, 820 (D.C. Cir. 2006)); see also Pub. Citizen, 297 F. Supp. 3d at 18.  \nHere, Plaintiffs refer to a specific member who, they assert, will suffer a cognizable injury—the \nincreased cost of applying for naturalization—but they do not identify that individual.  That \nomission has deprived Defendants of the ability to dispute Plaintiffs’ claim of associational \nstanding; Defendants cannot, for example, argue that the unidentified member is ineligible for \nnaturalization.  Moreover, even if the Court might under certain circumstances permit a member \nof an association to proceed anonymously, see Nat’l Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 226 & n.10 (D.D.C. 2018) (subsequent history omitted), \nPlaintiffs have failed to lay a proper foundation for making such a request.  Beyond that \nthreshold difficultly, Plaintiffs have at most shown that a member of CASA might be adversely \naffected by one of the many fee changes that Plaintiffs challenge.  That is problematic because \n“standing is not dispensed in gross,” Laroe Estates, 137 S. Ct. at 1650, and thus a plaintiff must \n“demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press,” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 \nU.S. 332, 335 (2006), and “for each form of relief sought,” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw \nEnv’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000).   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 21 of 75\nAccordingly, it is unlikely that Plaintiffs’ limited showing, even if accepted for present \npurposes, would suffice to establish CASA’s associational standing to challenge the entirety of \nthe Rule.   \n3.  Prudential Standing  \n  Defendants make a passing reference to Plaintiffs’ prudential standing to seek a \npreliminary injunction in a single sentence in a footnote in their opposition brief.  Dkt. 69 at 50 \nn.42; see also Dkt. 26 at 30 (motion to dismiss first amended complaint) (“Even if Plaintiff could \nestablish standing, its claims would still fail because they are outside the zone of interests served \nby the fee statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m), and fee waiver regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(c)(3).”).  \nCiting Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014), the \nsentence asserts:  “Nor is it clear that the agency must take into account the purported ‘burden[s]’ \nimposed on attorneys, rather than on applicants themselves, since immigration attorneys do not \nfall within the zone of interests served by the USCIS fee statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m).”  Dkt. 69 at \n50 n.42.  To the extent Defendants intend to raise a prudential standing defense, their effort fails. \nAs an initial matter, the Court is unpersuaded that this brief, conditional assertion in a \nfootnote is sufficient to preserve the issue.  The-zone-of-interests test “is not a jurisdictional \ndoctrine but, rather[,] . . . a tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action created in \nthe statute at issue.”  O.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 144 (quotation marks omitted).  In opposing \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, Defendants never assert that Plaintiffs fail the \nzone-of-interest test; they merely assert that it is unclear that DHS was required to consider the \ninterests of attorneys, as opposed to “applicants themselves.”  Dkt. 69 at 50 n.42.  That passing \nreference—without even taking a definitive view on the issue—fails to preserve what is a \nforfeitable argument. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 22 of 75\nBut, even if Defendants had raised the defense in opposing Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction, the Court would be unpersuaded.  As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \n“in keeping with Congress’s evident intent when enacting the APA “to make agency action \npresumptively reviewable,” the zone-of-interests test “is not meant to be especially demanding.”  \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) \n(quotation marks omitted).  “[T]he benefit of any doubt” as to the APA’s zone-of-interests test \n“goes to the plaintiff,” and the test therefore “forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  \n  The undemanding zone-of-interests test is satisfied here.  Plaintiffs’ daily work is \ngoverned by the INA and the fee provisions at issue here.  Provision 8 U.S.C. § 1255(l)(7) \nrequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to permit individuals seeking certain humanitarian \nbenefits to apply for fee waivers, Dkt. 27 at 28, and, as discussed, a non-trivial portion of each \norganization’s work is helping individuals apply for those waivers.  Similarly, the INA requires \nthe government to give T- and U-visa holders—two major client groups of NWIRP, Dkt. 11-1 at \n2 (Barón Decl. ¶ 6)—“referrals to nongovernmental organizations [like NWIRP] to advise [T- \nand U-visa holders of] their options,” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(3) (U visas); id. § 1101(i)(1) (T visas).  \nFinally, the INA requires the government to “seek the assistance of . . . private voluntary \nagencies” distributing information about naturalization.  Id. § 1443(h).  On its own terms, then, \nthe INA contemplates an important role for organizations like Plaintiffs.  It “cannot reasonably \nbe assumed that Congress intended to” prevent suit from those entities.  Patchak, 567 U.S. at 225 \n(quotation marks omitted).   \n*     *     * \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 23 of 75\n  The Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to \nprevail with respect to organizational and prudential standing.   \nB.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  The Court also concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits in two respects: \n(1) whether Chad Wolf had authority to act as the DHS Secretary when he approved (or ratified) \nthe Rule, and (2) whether the Rule was adopted in conformity with the APA.  Because Plaintiffs \nare likely to succeed on these claims, the Court does not consider other claims brought by \nPlaintiffs. \n  1.  Appointments Issues \n  Plaintiffs raise a host of challenges to the authority of Kevin McAleenan, who approved \nthe 2019 Proposed Rule, and Chad Wolf, who approved the 2020 Final Rule, to serve as Acting \nSecretary of DHS.  Dkt. 50 at 25–33.  Plaintiffs argue that both officials were appointed in \ncontravention of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., and the \nHomeland Security Act (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.  Id.  Plaintiffs further contend that \nbecause the officials were serving without lawful authority, the Final Rule is void.  Id. at 32–33. \n  Assessing Plaintiffs’ claims, which depend on the interplay between the FVRA and the \nHSA, requires consideration of both of these statutory provisions and the series of orders that \nhave purported to govern the line of succession at DHS in recent years.  Figuring out who, if \nanyone, was the rightful Acting Secretary at any given time is like divining the true heir to the \nIron Throne at the end of the Game of Thrones, Season 8, Episode 6, Game of Thrones (HBO \n2019).  Neither is an easy task. \n  The FVRA, enacted in 1998, provides a framework for temporarily filling vacancies in \noffices for which presidential appointment and Senate confirmation (“PAS”) is required.  5 \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 24 of 75\nU.S.C. § 3345 et seq.  The operative provision of the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3345, sets a default that \nif a PAS official “dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the \noffice,” then “the first assistant to the office of such officer shall perform the functions and duties \nof the office temporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section 3346.”  \nId. § 3345(a)(1).  Otherwise, “the President (and only the President)” may fill vacant PAS offices \non a temporary, acting basis with certain other federal officers.  Id. § 3345(a)(2)–(a)(3).  With \ncertain exceptions not relevant here, the next provision of the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3346, then \nlimits an acting officer to service of “no longer than 210 days,” id. § 3346(a)(1), or, if a \nnomination for the office has been submitted to the Senate, “for the period that the nomination is \npending in the Senate,” id. § 3346(a)(2).  The FVRA is the “exclusive means for temporarily \nauthorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any” PAS officer, unless \nanother statute “expressly” creates an alternative mechanism for filling vacancies in a given \nagency.  Id. § 3347.  And violations of the FVRA have consequences: “An action taken by any \nperson who is not acting” in compliance with the FVRA “in the performance of any function or \nduty of a vacant office to which” the FVRA applies “shall have no force and effect,” \nid. § 3348(d)(1), and any such action “may not be ratified,” id. § 3348(d)(2). \n  On December 9, 2016, President Obama issued an Executive Order in which he exercised \nhis authority under the FVRA to set a line of succession that would govern “during any period in \nwhich the [DHS] Secretary has died, resigned, or otherwise become unable to perform the \nfunctions and duties of the office of Secretary.”  Exec. Order No. 13753, 81 Fed. Reg. 90,667, \n90,667 (Dec. 9, 2016) (“E.O. 13753”).  The order set out which DHS officials would “in the \norder listed . . . act as, and perform the functions and duties of the office of, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security . . . if they are eligible to act as Secretary under the provisions of the Federal \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 25 of 75\nVacancies Reform Act.”  Id.  Several days later, on December 15, 2016, then-Secretary Jeh \nJohnson implemented the Executive Order by issuing Revision 8 to the “DHS Orders of \nSuccession and Delegations of Authorities for Named Positions.”  Dkt. 69-3 at 7.  Within the \nlimits of the FVRA, that document created a bifurcated structure for which Department officials \nwould act as Secretary in different situations.  Id.  In Section II.A., Johnson dealt with succession \ngenerally by providing that, “[i]n case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to \nperform the functions of the Office, the orderly succession of officials is governed by Executive \nOrder 13753.”  Id.  In Section II.B., Johnson delegated to a separate list of officials, attached as \n“Annex A,” his authority “to exercise the powers and perform the functions and duties of [the \nSecretary’s] office, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by law, in the event [the Secretary is] \nunavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.”  Id. \n  Just a few days later, Congress amended the HSA to exempt DHS from the FVRA in \ncertain respects and to give the Secretary greater authority to designate the order of succession \nfor Acting Secretaries.  See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Pub. L. \nNo. 114-328, 130 Stat. 2000 (Dec. 23, 2016).  The statute designates the Deputy Secretary of \nHomeland Security as “the Secretary’s first assistant for purposes of [the FVRA].”  6 \nU.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A).  As noted above, the FVRA sets a default rule that if an officer “dies, \nresigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office,” then “the first \nassistant to the office of” that officer is vested with authority to “perform the functions and duties \nof the office temporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations” set forth elsewhere \nin the FVRA.  5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1).   \nThe amendment further provides that, notwithstanding the FVRA, “if by reason of \nabsence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 26 of 75\nto exercise the duties of the Office of the Secretary,” then in that case “the Under Secretary for \nManagement shall serve as the Acting Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1).  The default line of \nsuccession thus passes from the Secretary to the Deputy Secretary to the Under Secretary for \nManagement.  Beyond those three officers, the amended statute also empowers the Secretary to \ndesignate a “further order of succession.”  Id. § 113(g)(2).  That subsection provides: \n“Notwithstanding [the FVRA], the Secretary may designate such other officers of the \nDepartment in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”  Id.  It is this final open-\nended succession provision on which the dispute in this case turns.  \n  The last presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security \nwas Kirstjen Nielsen.  She resigned on April 10, 2019, creating a vacancy in the Office of the \nSecretary that persists to this day.  Dkt. 50 at 26.  Just before resigning, Secretary Nielsen \n“approved” a document that, according to Defendants, amended the order of succession \nestablished by Secretary Johnson.  Dkt, 50-4 at 127–28.  As relevant here, Nielsen purported to \nmove the position of Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) from \nfourteenth to third on the list of officials who could assume the position of Acting Secretary.  Id; \nE.O. 13753, 81 Fed. Reg. at 90,667.   \n  Because McAleenan was serving as the CBP commissioner at the time—and because the \noffices of Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary for Management were both vacant—\nMcAleenan purportedly became Acting Secretary upon Secretary Nielsen’s resignation, pursuant \nto her amendment to the order of succession.  Dkt. 69 at 18.  After only a few months on the job, \nMcAleenan announced his resignation.  On November 8, 2019, on his way out of office, \nMcAleenan again amended the order of succession to move the Under Secretary for Strategy, \nPolicy, and Plans up to fourth on the list, behind only the Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary for \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 27 of 75\nManagement, and the Commissioner of CBP.  Dkt. 50-4 at 129.  Three days later, on November \n13, 2019, the Senate confirmed Wolf as the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, and \nbecause all of the positions ahead of his in McAleenan’s succession order were vacant, Wolf \nimmediately assumed the role of Acting Secretary.  Dkt. 50 at 28. \n  Plaintiffs challenge the appointments of the two Acting Secretaries on several grounds.  \nId. at 25–33.  For the purposes of assessing Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, the \nCourt focuses on their two strongest arguments: First, Plaintiffs contend that Secretary Nielsen’s \neffort to amend the order of succession failed because she amended only Annex A to the Johnson \norder, which dealt exclusively with temporary vacancies occurring when the Secretary is \n“unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.”  Id.  According to Plaintiffs, \nthat left McAleenan without authority to issue the proposed Rule and, more importantly, without \nauthority to re-amend the order of succession to place Wolf in line to serve as Acting Secretary.  \nId.  Second, Plaintiffs argue that under 6 U.S.C. § 113, only a presidentially appointed, Senate-\nconfirmed Secretary—and not an Acting Secretary—can designate an order of succession.  Id. at \n29–31.  Thus, even if McAleenan’s appointment as Acting Secretary was proper, neither he nor \nany other Acting Secretary had the authority under the statute to handpick his successor, and \nWolf’s appointment was therefore unlawful.  Id.   \nIn recent weeks, two other district courts have accepted versions of the first argument, \nholding that Wolf’s appointment was invalid and that actions he has taken as Acting Secretary \nare void.  See Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr., 2020 WL 5798269; Casa de Maryland v. Wolf, No. \n8:20-cv-02118-PX, 2020 WL 5500165 (D. Md. Sept. 11, 2020).  This Court reaches a different \nconclusion with respect to Plaintiffs’ first argument but, nonetheless, arrives at the same bottom \nline because it is persuaded that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their second argument.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 28 of 75\na.  Error in McAleenan’s Appointment \n  Plaintiffs first claim that Secretary Nielsen’s attempt to amend the Department’s order of \nsuccession was ineffective, following the reasoning that the Government Accountability Office \n(“GAO”) applied in reaching a similar conclusion.  See GAO, Homeland Security, File B-\n331650 (Aug. 14, 2020), https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf.   \nAs explained above, the Johnson order created a bifurcated order of succession by \nordering that Executive Order 13753 governs “[i]n case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or \ninability to perform the functions of the Office,” but that Annex A, listing sixteen DHS officials, \ngoverns if the Secretary is “unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.”  Dkt. \n50-4 at 61, 65.  Secretary Nielsen, in turn, approved a memorandum to “designate [her] desired \norder of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security in accordance with [her] authority \npursuant to Section 113(g)(2) of title 6, United States Code.”  Id. at 127.  The attached document, \nhowever, amended only Annex A, not the broader agency policy governing succession.  Id. at \n128.   \nPlaintiffs argue that by amending Annex A, Secretary Nielsen changed the order of \ndelegation to serve as Acting Secretary only “in event of disaster or catastrophic emergency.”  \nDkt. 50 at 28; Dkt. 50-4 at 61.  But, on Plaintiffs’ reading of the administrative record, she did \nnot amend § II.A of the Johnson order, which incorporated the order of succession specified by \nthe President in Executive Order 13753 in all circumstances other than the unavailability of the \nSecretary during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.  Dkt. 50 at 27.  And because the \nExecutive Order puts the CBP Commissioner fourteenth in line—behind the Director of the \nDepartment’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Administrator of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), among others, see E.O. 13753, 81 Fed. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 29 of 75\nReg. at 90,668—Commissioner McAleenan was never properly designated to serve as Acting \nSecretary.  Dkt. 50 at 27–28.  Thus, so the argument goes, because Secretary Nielsen amended \nonly Annex A, her resignation left the Director of the Department’s Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Security Agency, which was the highest position on the Executive Order’s list that \nwas filled at the time, in line to serve as Acting Secretary.  Id. \n  Following Plaintiffs’ reasoning, the flaw in Secretary Nielsen’s effort to designate \nMcAleenan to serve as Acting Secretary carried over to infect Wolf’s appointment to serve as \nActing Secretary as well.  As noted above, before his resignation, McAleenan amended the order \nof succession again.  Dkt. 50-4 at 129.  This time, McAleenan explicitly changed not only the \norder of succession for emergencies but also adopted a new order of succession applicable in \ncases “of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office.”  \nId.  He accomplished this by amending § II.A. of the Johnson order, which covers vacancies \nbecause of death, resignation, or inability to perform, so that it cross-referenced the list of \nofficials in Annex A, rather than cross-referencing the Executive Order.  Id.  This eliminated any \nbifurcation in the order of succession at the Department because, after McAleenan’s amendment, \n§§ II.A. and II.B. both cross-referenced Annex A.  McAleenan’s order further amended Annex A \nto move up the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans in the line of succession and \neffectively selected Wolf (who was days away from confirmation to serve as the Under \nSecretary) as McAleenan’s successor as Acting Secretary.  That effort, however, once again \nfailed, according the Plaintiffs.  This time, DHS got the language right, but because McAleenan \nwas not properly serving as Acting Secretary, his effort to amend the order of succession was a \nnullity—and, in Plaintiffs’ view, Wolf’s appointment was unlawful as well.  Dkt. 50 at 29. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 30 of 75\n  As mentioned above, two other district courts have found this reasoning compelling.  See \nImmigrant Legal Res. Ctr., 2020 WL 5798269; Casa de Maryland, 2020 WL 5500165.  The \nCourt may assume, without deciding, that Plaintiffs’ reasoning is correct to this point, because a \nlittle further down the tortuous road of DHS succession, the Court parts ways with these other \ncourts and holds that Plaintiffs’ claims related to Nielsen’s efforts to amend the Johnson order \nhave finally hit a dead end.   \nOn September 10, 2020, a week after Plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary \ninjunction, President Trump nominated Wolf to serve as the Secretary of Homeland Security.  \nDkt. 69 at 30.  That same day, in response to both the ongoing litigation and the GAO opinion, \nFEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor, who would have been Acting Secretary according to the \norder of succession designated by Executive Order 13753, issued a new order of succession that \nlisted the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans—that is, Wolf—as the Acting \nSecretary, in line of succession behind the vacant offices of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under \nSecretary for Management, and CBP Commissioner.  Dkt. 69-3 at 47; Dkt. 69 at 30.  A week \nlater, Wolf issued an order “ratifying each of [his] delegable prior actions as Acting Secretary,” \nincluding his prior approval of the Final Rule at issue in this litigation.  Dkt. 69-3 at 50–52. \n  Gaynor’s order was (at least arguably) enough to make Wolf the legitimate Acting \nSecretary, based on the following chain of inferences.  If Nielsen’s order technically failed to \nchange the order of succession in the event of a resignation, then McAleenan did not lawfully \nbecome Acting Secretary.  And if McAleenan did not lawfully become Acting Secretary, then his \nown attempts to alter the order of succession in the event of a resignation also failed.  That would \nmean that as of September 10, 2020, the operative document dictating the order of succession in \nthe event of a resignation was still the Executive Order, as specified in Johnson’s original order, \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 31 of 75\nwhich both Nielsen and McAleenan had failed effectively to amend.1  Under the Executive \nOrder, moreover, the FEMA Director is fourth in line to serve as Acting Secretary.  Thus, when \nGaynor was confirmed by the Senate to serve as FEMA Director—with all the offices above his \nin the Executive Order’s line of succession remaining vacant—he became Acting Secretary on \nJanuary 14, 2020.  As such, so Defendant’s theory goes, Gaynor had the power as Acting \nSecretary to name a further order of succession under 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) and properly \ndesignated Wolf to replace him. \n  One potential snag for this theory is that the Executive Order designated its order of \nsuccession pursuant to the FVRA, which includes a 210-day time limit for acting officials \n“beginning on the date the vacancy occurs.”  5 U.S.C. § 3346(a)(1).  Here, Nielsen resigned on \nApril 10, 2019, and far more than 210 days passed before Gaynor purported to amend the order \nof succession, potentially rendering that action void.  But a separate provision of the FVRA \npermits an acting official to serve “from the date of” a first nomination for the vacant office and \n“for the period that the nomination is pending in the Senate.”  Id. § 3346(a)(2).  Because \n                                                           \n1  Nor does the DHS Secretary (much less the Acting Secretary) have authority to amend or to \nsupersede an executive order.  The existence of two, conflicting orders of succession—one \nestablished pursuant to the FVRA and the other pursuant to § 113—does, however, raise a series \nof questions about the interaction of the two regimes and about how conflicts between the two \nare best resolved.  Under one of those regimes, the President has directed that the Administrator \nof FEMA, when the positions ahead of his in the order of succession are vacant, “shall act as, \nand perform the functions and duties of the office of, the Secretary of Homeland Security.”  E.O. \n13753, 81 Fed. Reg. at 90,667.  But under the other, the Acting Secretary—serving pursuant to a \ndesignation under the Executive Order—has directed that the Under Secretary for Strategy, \nPolicy, and Plans serve as Acting Secretary.  Dkt. 69-3 at 47.  Because Plaintiffs have not \nchallenged Wolf’s designation on this ground, and because neither party has briefed the issue, \nthe Court simply notes the oddity of an order from an Acting Secretary purporting to supplant a \npresidential designation.  Of course, Gaynor as Acting Secretary made his purported designation \nunder a different (and non-exclusive) legal regime, one that vests the Secretary with discretion to \ndesignate a line of succession “[n]otwithstanding” the FVRA.  But, even with that statutory \ndiscretion, the approach advocated here would seem to turn the normal executive branch \nhierarchy on its head. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 32 of 75\nPresident Trump nominated Wolf the same day that Gaynor purported to amend the order of \nsuccession, Gaynor was lawfully serving as Acting Secretary under the Executive Order and the \nFVRA at the time he amended the order of succession.2 \n  This leaves the question whether Wolf successfully ratified McAleenan’s prior approval \nof the Proposed Rule and his own prior approval of the Final Rule, purging those actions of any \nillegitimacy.  The answer to that question is complicated and turns on the interplay between the \nFVRA, the HSA, and the APA, as well as the byzantine path leading to Wolf’s re-designation to \nserve as Acting Secretary.  Assuming, as the Court does, that McAleenan and Wolf were not \nproperly serving as Acting Secretary when they initially issued the Proposed Rule and the Final \nRule because of the flaws in Nielsen’s and McAleenan’s attempted amendments to the order of \nsuccession, the line of lawful authority starts with Gaynor, who was serving as Acting Secretary \npursuant to Executive Order 13753 and the FVRA.  Gaynor then purported to amend the order of \nsuccession to name Wolf as Acting Secretary pursuant to the HSA, see 6 U.S.C. § 113(g).  \nBelow, in Section II.B.1.b, the Court considers whether the HSA gives one Acting Secretary the \npower to designate another Acting Secretary.  But for the purpose of assessing Plaintiffs’ claims \nbased on harms flowing from Nielsen’s unlawful appointment of McAleenan, the Court will \nassume that Gaynor, as Acting Secretary, had the statutory authority under the HSA to alter the \norder of succession, effectively designating Wolf to serve as Acting Secretary.  When Gaynor \ndid so, Wolf became the Acting Secretary, not pursuant to the FVRA, but pursuant to the HSA.  \n                                                           \n2  The President could not have directly designated Wolf to serve as the Acting Secretary \npursuant to the FVRA because the FVRA bars a nominee to a vacant office from filling that \nvacancy in an acting capacity unless he or she served as the first assistant to that office before the \nvacancy arose for at least 90 days, see 5 U.S.C. § 3345(b)(1); NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 137 S. \nCt. 929 (2017), aff’d, 137 S. Ct. 929 (2017), and Wolf never served as the Deputy Secretary.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 33 of 75\nThe question, then, is whether an official serving as Acting Secretary pursuant to the HSA may \nratify a proposed and final rule issued by an official who was acting without authority. \n  The answer depends on the antecedent question of whether the errors in McAleenan’s \nand Wolf’s appointments rendered the Proposed and Final Rules void in the first place.  Plaintiffs \nargue that the issuance of the Proposed and Final Rules was unlawful under both the FVRA and \nthe APA.  Dkt. 50 at 32–33.  The FVRA provides that “[a]n action taken by any person who is \nnot acting” in compliance with the FVRA, “in the performance of any function or duty of a \nvacant office to which” the FVRA applies, “shall have no force or effect” and “may not be \nratified.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(d).  Even though McAleenan at the time of the Proposed Rule and \nWolf at the time of the Final Rule were purportedly serving under the HSA, the Court is not \npersuaded that this renders § 3348(d) of the FVRA inapplicable, at least based on the limited \nbriefing to date.  That provision does not by its terms apply only to acting officials designated to \nserve pursuant to the FVRA, but, rather, applies to “a vacant office to which” the FVRA applies.  \nId.  There is no doubt that the FVRA applies to the Office of the Secretary, and thus its provision \ngiving “no force or effect” to the actions of acting officials serving unlawfully applies to \nMcAleenan and Wolf.  Of course, had McAleenan and Wolf been properly designated under the \nHSA, Defendants would have avoided this problem, because the FVRA provides the “exclusive \nmeans for temporarily authorizing acting officials to perform the functions and duties of any \noffice of an Executive Branch agency, . . . unless . . . a statutory provision expressly . . . \nauthorize[d] . . . the head of an Executive department[] to designate” the official to serve “in an \nacting capacity.”  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)(1)(A).  But, if McAleenan and Wolf (in the first instance) \nwere not designated in conformity with the HSA, then they failed to qualify for the exception, \nand their unauthorized acting service was subject to the strictures of the FVRA.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 34 of 75\nDespite this difficulty, Defendants have a persuasive response: the vacant office \nprovision of the FVRA does not void all actions taken by those serving without authority—it \nnullifies only actions taken “in the performance of any function or duty of a vacant office” that is \nsubject to the FVRA, id. § 3348(d).  Significantly, the term “function or duty” is narrowly \ndefined to include only those functions or duties that are (1) “established by statute” and \n“required by statute to be performed by the applicable officer (and only that officer)” or (2) \n“established by regulation” during the “180-day period preceding the date on which the vacancy \noccurred” and “required by such regulation to be performed by the applicable officer (and only \nthat officer).”  Id. § 3348(a)(2).  It is here that Plaintiffs’ first line of argument hits a dead end.  \nDefendants point to a 2003 delegation from the Secretary that authorizes the Deputy Secretary to \nact for the Secretary “to sign, approve, or disapprove any proposed or final rule, regulation or \nrelated document.”  Dkt. 69-3 at 54–55; Dkt. 69 at 32–33.  The Court has previously interpreted \nthe FVRA’s definition of “function or duty” to encompass delegable duties that were not \ndelegated during the 180-day window proceeding the vacancy.  See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F. \nSupp. 3d 1, 34 (D.D.C. 2020).  But here, because the Secretary delegated the authority to issue \nDepartment rules in 2003, that power is not vested exclusively in the Secretary and is therefore \nnot the type of action that is voided under the FVRA.  5 U.S.C. § 3348.   \n  Plaintiffs offer three responses.  First, they assert that “DHS does not state that the 2003 \ndocument is still operative,” and “[i]ts text suggests that it is not, since it addresses what happens \nwhen the Secretary resigns or is absent, a topic now addressed by the Johnson order and 6 \nU.S.C. § 113.”  Dkt. 74 at 16.  It is Plaintiffs, however, who carry the burden of demonstrating \nthat they are likely to succeed on the merits, and the Court has no reason to question Defendants’ \ngood faith in proffering the 2003 document as a preexisting (and, the Court can only assume, still \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 35 of 75\nexisting) delegation.3  Second, Plaintiffs argue that the 2003 document makes the Deputy \nSecretary the agent of the Secretary only for “a portion of the rulemaking process” such that “the \nrulemaking function . . . remains exclusive to the Secretary.”  Id.  That argument, however, \nignores that the 2003 document introduces all of the listed responsibilities as “a delegation to the \nDeputy Secretary to fulfill responsibilities . . . on behalf of the Secretary.”  Dkt. 69-3 at 54.  This \nlanguage indicates that all of the listed delegations are similar in kind, and the language Plaintiffs \nhighlight to distinguish the delegated power to sign regulations is not so clear as to overcome the \nstated purpose of the document.  Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary’s authority to issue \nfinal rules is established by statute and required by statute to be performed by the Secretary and \nonly the Secretary.  Dkt. 74 at 16–17.  But, in making that argument, Plaintiffs cite to 6 \nU.S.C. § 112, and that provision authorizes the Secretary to delegate any of her statutorily \nassigned functions, “except as otherwise provided by this chapter.”  Plaintiffs fail to cite to any \nprovision that precludes delegation of authority to approve a final rule.  The Court, accordingly, \nconcludes that the power to sign, approve, or disapprove proposed or final rules is not a \n“function or duty” of the Secretary within the meaning of the vacant office provision of the \nFVRA, and therefore the FVRA does not mandate that the Proposed Rule and Final Rule have \n“no force or effect.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348. \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the Court should vacate the Final Rule because McAleenan and \nWolf acted without statutory authority, and their actions, therefore, were not in accordance with \nlaw for purposes of the APA, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 796 F.3d 67, \nprovides a helpful starting point for considering this argument.  In that case, the D.C. Circuit held \n                                                           \n3  If that assumption is mistaken, the Court expects (and directs) that Defendants promptly \ncorrect the record.   \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 36 of 75\nthat the Acting General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) violated the \nFVRA provision that prohibits an official from continuing to serve in an acting capacity after the \nPresident has nominated the official to fill the office in which they are acting.  Id. at 78; see also \n5 U.S.C. § 3345(b)(1).  But because the FVRA exempts the General Counsel of the NLRB from \nthe vacant office provision, 5 U.S.C. § 3348(e)(1), the court was required to decide whether the \nAPA provides a remedy apart from the remedy found in the FVRA, SW Gen., 796 F.3d at 79.  \nBecause the NLRB merely argued that the APA’s harmless error rule and the de facto officer \ndoctrine prevented vacatur of the NLRB order at issue in that case, the court assumed, without \ndeciding, that § 3348 did not affirmatively “insulate” the actions of the Acting General Counsel \nfrom attack.  Id.  The Court then held that neither the “rule of prejudicial error” under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706 nor the de facto officer doctrine saved the challenged NLRB order from vacatur.  \nId. at 79–83.  Applying that same framework here, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have yet to \ndemonstrate that they are likely to prevail on the merits of this claim.  \nUnder the APA’s “rule of prejudicial error,” 5 U.S.C. § 706, reviewing courts must \nconsider whether the agency’s error affected the outcome.  See Jicarilla Apache Nation v. U.S. \nDep’t of Interior, 613 F.3d 1112, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  “The burden to demonstrate prejudicial \nerror is on the party challenging agency action,” but it “is ‘not . . . a particularly onerous \nrequirement.’”  Id. (quoting Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 410 (2009)).  Ratification, \nhowever, can render harmless an error in an official’s appointment.  As the D.C. Circuit has \nrecognized, “any statutory defect in [an] acting director’s authority [is] cured [if] a subsequent, \nproperly appointed director ratified [the] action[].”  SW Gen., 796 F.3d at 79 (citing Doolin, 139 \nF.3d at 213 (D.C. Cir. 1998)); see also Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co. v. NLRB, 857 F.3d 364, 371 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017); Intercollegiate Broad. Sys. Inc. v. Copyright Royalty Bd., 796 F.3d 111, 119 \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 37 of 75\nn.3 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Many of those cases arose in the context of administrative adjudication, \nand their reasoning is difficult to adapt to the rulemaking context.  But in one recent case, the \nD.C. Circuit held that plaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the merits of an \nappointments-based challenge to a rulemaking because of “a properly appointed official’s \nratification of an allegedly improper official’s prior action.”  Guedes, 920 F.3d at 13.  Guedes \nrelied in part on the plaintiffs’ concession that the ratification was valid, id. at 12, so that portion \nof the D.C. Circuit’s analysis does not establish a binding rule.  It is nonetheless notable that the \nGuedes court applied the ratification doctrine to the rulemaking context without pause.  Id. at 13.   \n  Here, the Court concludes that, assuming Gaynor properly appointed Wolf to serve as \nActing Secretary—a question that the Court takes up below—it is likely that Wolf’s ratification \nrendered the errors in the initial promulgation of the Proposed Rule and the Final Rule harmless.  \nBecause Wolf was ratifying his own action in adopting the Final Rule, and because McAleenan \nwas not acting as a “statutorily independent” official with a distinct perspective when he issued \nthe Proposed Rule, SW Gen., 797 F.3d at 80, there is no reason to doubt that the Rule would have \ncome out the same way if he had been serving properly in the first instance.  Nor is there any \nindication in the record that either the Proposed Rule or the Final Rule would have come out any \ndifferently had they been approved instead by the Director of the Department’s Cybersecurity \nand Infrastructure Security Agency, whom Plaintiffs argue should have rightfully become Acting \nSecretary pursuant to the Executive Order, following Nielsen’s resignation.  Dkt. 50 at 27–28.  In \nlight of the precedent from the court of appeals holding that ratifications can cure appointments-\nrelated issues, and because Plaintiffs have failed to make any substantial argument to the \ncontrary, the Court concludes that Wolf’s ratification was likely effective, at least to the extent \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 38 of 75\nthat he was serving lawfully after Gaynor purported to amend the order of succession, which is \nthe question to which the Court turns next. \n  The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir claim that Nielsen’s flawed appointment of McAleenan rendered the Final Rule invalid. \nb.  Acting Secretary’s Power to Name an Order of Succession Under the HSA \n  Underlying the foregoing analysis was the assumption that Gaynor, as Acting Secretary, \nhad the power under 6 U.S.C. § 113(g) to amend the Department’s order of succession.  But \nPlaintiffs raise a separate argument that calls that premise into question.  They contend that “the \nHSA’s succession-order provision [6 U.S.C. § 113(g)] does not give an acting secretary authority \nto change the order of succession.”  Dkt. 50 at 29 (emphasis in original).  This argument relies on \na literal reading of the statute, which provides that, “[n]otwithstanding [the FVRA], the Secretary \nmay designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as \nActing Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  Because the provision “distinguishes the role of \n‘Secretary’ from that of ‘Acting Secretary,’” Plaintiffs maintain that “[t]he Court should ‘respect \nCongress’[s] decision to use different terms to describe different categories of people’ in this \ncontext.”  Dkt. 50 at 29–30 (quoting Mohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 456 (2012)). \n  Plaintiffs find support for their reading of the statute in the FVRA, which by its terms \nconstitutes the “exclusive means” for appointing acting officials unless another statute “expressly \nauthorizes . . . the President, a court, or the head of an Executive department, to designate an \nofficer or employee to perform the functions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an \nacting capacity.”  5 U.S.C. §3347(a)(1).  Plaintiffs argue that the HSA, by stating that the \n“Secretary” may designate an order of succession, does not “expressly” vest that power in an \n“Acting Secretary.”  Dkt. 50 at 30.  And Plaintiffs further contend that even if the HSA might be \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 39 of 75\nread to vest the Acting Secretary with authority to designate other acting secretaries, the FVRA \ndoes not permit such a result, because it “does not indicate that an acting ‘head of an Executive \ndepartment’ can designate acting officials.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Defendants counter that \nacting officials are generally understood to possess all the powers of the vacant office they are \noccupying, and it would be inconsistent to read the word “Secretary” as including an Acting \nSecretary when delineating the Secretary’s powers in other parts of the HSA but not in 6 U.S.C. \n§ 113(g)(2).  Dkt. 69 at 25–26. \n  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the FVRA provides support for their reading \nof § 113(g)(2), for the reasons given and others.  As always when interpreting a statute, the Court \nbegins with the text.  See BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Burton, 549 U.S. 84, 91 (2006).  Here, it is \nimportant to place the text of the HSA in context, including its textual relationship and interplay \nwith the FVRA.  The relevant provision of the HSA, 6 U.S.C. § 113, starts by providing that the \nDeputy Secretary “shall be the Secretary’s first assistant for purposes of” the FVRA, which \nexpressly ties 6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A) to the FVRA’s default rule, 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a).  In \ncircumstances in which neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available to exercise the \nduties of the Secretary, “by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office,” § 113 first \nprovides that “[n]otwithstanding [the FVRA], the Under Secretary for Management shall serve \nas the Acting Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1).  This fits into the FVRA provision recognizing \nexceptions in which another statute “expressly . . . designates” a specific “officer or employee to \nperform the functions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 3347(a)(1)(B).  Finally, § 113(g) provides, again “[n]otwithstanding” the FVRA, that \n“the Secretary may designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession \nto serve as Acting Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  As Plaintiffs point out, this language \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 40 of 75\ncorresponds to the FVRA provision allowing for exceptions that “expressly . . . authorize[] the \nPresident, a court, or the head of an Executive department[] to designate” acting officials.  5 \nU.S.C. § 3347(a)(1)(A). \n  It is thus clear that Congress wrote the HSA to operate alongside the FVRA, but the \n“notwithstanding” clauses make equally clear that the HSA establishes an exception to the \nFVRA framework.  In interpreting the meaning of the word “Secretary” in § 113(g)(2), the Court \nmust decide how big an exception to the FVRA Congress created.  The FVRA vests the power to \nset an order of succession beyond a vacant office’s first assistant in “the President (and only the \nPresident).”  Id. §§ 3345(a)(2); 3345(a)(3).  The HSA creates an exception to this rule that allows \nthe Secretary (and not “only the President”) to establish an order of succession as well.  If the \nprovision refers only to a PAS Secretary, then it is a narrow exception.  If, however, the word \n“Secretary” in § 113(g)(2) is read to include an Acting Secretary, that would make the exception \nmuch more capacious.  Under the broad reading of the exception that Defendants endorse, the \nSecretary could designate the lowest-ranking “officer” in any office or agency within the \nDepartment to serve as Acting Secretary, and once in office, that Acting Secretary could amend \nthe Department’s order of succession to name other low-ranking “officers” to succeed him.  \nNothing in the text of the HSA would limit Defendants’ reading of § 113(g)(2) to PAS or even \npresidentially appointed officers.  As a result, an exception to the FVRA’s requirement that the \n“President (and only the President)” designate acting officers would permit any “officer” in the \nDepartment, who is designated by the Secretary to serve in her absence, to fill the role ordinarily \nreserved to the “President (and only the President)” to designate such an acting official. \n  As the Supreme Court has explained, a canon of statutory interpretation instructs that \n“[a]n exception to a ‘general statement of policy’ is ‘usually read . . . narrowly in order to \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 41 of 75\npreserve the primary operation of the provision.’”  Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 60 (2013) \n(quoting Commissioner v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (1989)).  “[E]xceptions ought not operate to \nthe farthest reach of their linguistic possibilities if that result would contravene the statutory \ndesign.”  Id.  As the Court explained in L.M.-M., “Congress enacted the FVRA, in large part, to \n‘recla[im]’ its ‘Appointments Clause power.’”  L.M.-M., 442 F. Supp. 3d at 29 (citing SW Gen., \n796 F.3d at 70).  “Congress was concerned, most notably, that the Attorney General and other \ndepartment heads had made frequent use of organic vesting and delegation statutes to assign the \nduties of PAS offices to officers and employees, with little or no check from Congress.”  Id.  To \nbe sure, the FVRA left open the possibility that other statutes could carve out agency-specific \nexceptions, and, by amending the HSA in 2016, Congress created such an exception.  But in the \nface of statutory ambiguity, the Court may not read the exception in a way that “decimate[s the \nFVRA’s] carefully crafted framework.”  Id. at 28.  Under Defendants’ broad reading of \n“Secretary” in § 113(g)(2), “[t]he President would be relieved of responsibility and \naccountability for selecting acting officials,” id., and that power could pass not only to a PAS \nSecretary but to lower-level “officers” whom the President did not appoint and, perhaps, whom \nthe President has never even heard of.  The exception to the FVRA’s “exclusive means” \nprovision, 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a), and the provision vesting “the President (and only the President)” \nwith authority to designate acting officials beyond the first assistant, id. § 3345(a), would thereby \nopen the door to the Secretary and any officer the Secretary might designate to serve in her stead \nto determine who will lead the Department.  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that such a reading \nwould undermine the structure and purpose of the FVRA and that such a reading should \ntherefore be avoided.   \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 42 of 75\nDefendants’ broad reading of § 113(g) is also at odds with the plain meaning of the word \n“expressly.”  The exception to the exclusive-means provision of the FVRA applies only if “a \nstatutory provision expressly . . . [1] authorizes the President, a court, or the head of an Executive \ndepartment to designate an officer or employee to perform the functions and duties of a specified \nofficer temporarily in an acting capacity” or “[2] designates an officer or employee to perform \nthe functions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity.”  5 U.S.C. § \n3347(a)(1) (emphasis added).  This language distinguishes between the vacant office and the \nofficer designated temporarily to perform the duties of that office.  The acting official does not \nfill the vacant office but, rather, is authorized to “perform the functions and duties” of that office; \nthat is, an Acting Secretary does not become the Secretary but, instead, is merely authorized to \nperform the functions and duties of the vacant office.  That understanding of what it means to \nserve in an acting capacity, moreover, is far from novel.  See Boyle v. United States, 1857 WL \n4155, at *3 (Ct. Cl. Jan. 19, 1857) (“We do not consider that the mere fact that the duties of both \noffices are the same makes the offices themselves identical. . . . [T]he [Acting Secretary] can \nperform all the duties of Secretary, and yet is not Secretary.”). \nThe word “expressly,” in turn, means “explicitly,” “particularly,” or “specifically.”  \nExpressly, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/expressly?src=search-dict-hed (last accessed Oct. 8, 2020).  Against this \nbackdrop, Defendants fail to explain how a provision that vests the “Secretary” with authority to \ndesignate an order of succession can be understood to expressly—or explicitly—authorize an \n“Acting Secretary” to perform that same function.  To be sure, acting officials are typically \n“vested with the same authority that could be exercised by the officer for whom he acts,” In re \nGrand Jury Investigation, 916 F.3d 1047, 1055 (D.C. Cir. 2019), but an acting official must take \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 43 of 75\non that authority either by implication or by virtue of statutory language that expressly vests the \nacting official with that authority, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 508 (vesting Deputy Attorney General with \nauthority to “exercise all the duties of” the office of Attorney General is case of a vacancy).  \nOnly the latter is sufficient to create an exception to the FVRA, and no such express statutory \nlanguage is present here.  Because the FVRA demands an “express” statutory authorization, the \nCourt reads “Secretary” in § 113(g)(2) to mean the Secretary, and not an Acting Secretary. \n  The Constitution’s Appointments Clause provides substantial support for this reading.  \nThe Appointments Clause has two prongs.  Under the first, the President is empowered to \n“nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, [to] appoint Ambassadors, \nother public Ministers and Counsels, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the \nUnited States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, \ncl. 2.  Under the second prong, known as the “Excepting Clause,” “Congress may by Law vest \nthe Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the \nCourts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.”  Id.  Reading 6 U.S.C. § 113(g) to permit any \nDepartment official who is serving as Acting Secretary to appoint successors to the office of \nActing Secretary would raise the question whether such an official is the “Head of Department” \nfor purposes of the Appointments Clause.  In addressing that point, the Court begins with \nDefendants’ well-taken concession that anyone other than the Deputy Secretary (or perhaps the \nUnder Secretary for Management who is serving as the Acting Secretary) is an inferior officer \nfor purposes of the Appointments Clause.  Dkt. 69 at 26.  That concession follows from settled \nprecedent.  See Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 661–63 (1997); Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 675 (1988); United States v. Eaton, 169 U.S. 331, 343 (1898).  Logic also necessitates \nthat result: Any Acting Secretary who was not appointed to that position (or to a germane \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 44 of 75\nposition) by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate is by definition not a \nprincipal officer, see U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and the Acting Secretary of the Department \nundoubtedly exercises significant governmental authority, meaning he or she is not simply an \nemployee of the Department, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 125–26 (1976).   \n  The difficult constitutional question can thus be rephrased as whether the Heads of \nDepartments for purposes of the Excepting Clause can include inferior officers of the United \nStates.  If an inferior officer lacks the constitutional authority to appoint another inferior officer, \nthen it seems improbable—or at least discordant—that an inferior officer may alter the order of \nsuccession in a manner that, in effect, chooses which of the many officers serving at the \nDepartment will become the Acting Secretary.  No existing precedent, however, answers this \nquestion.  “As Justice Souter . . . noted” in his concurring opinion in Weiss v. United States, 510 \nU.S. 163, 192–93 (1994), “it remains unresolved whether ‘the Appointments Clause envisions \nappointment of some inferior officers by other inferior officers.’”  The Constitutional Separation \nof Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124, 1996 WL 876050, at *17 \nn.82 (May 7, 1996).  Various authorities point in different directions. \n  Non-textual evidence of what the Framers intended is scarce.  As the Supreme Court has \nobserved, the Excepting Clause was added to the Constitution on the final day of debate, with \nlittle discussion.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 660.  What evidence that does exist, however, suggests \nthat the Framers intended to limit “Heads of Department” for purposes of the Appointments \nClause to principal officers—or at least never conceived that an inferior officer might serve as a \n“Head of Department.”  After Gouverneur Morris proposed the Excepting Clause, James \nMadison objected on the ground that the exemption “does not go far enough if it be necessary at \nall.”  2 Max Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 627 (1911).  Madison \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 45 of 75\nfurther explained that, in his opinion, “Superior Officers below Heads of Departments ought in \nsome cases to have the appointment of the lesser offices.”  Id.  The matter was then put to a vote, \nand Morris’s motion to add the Excepting Clause failed by an evenly divided vote.  It was then \nurged that the motion be put to a second vote, and this time it carried unanimously.  Id. at 627–\n28.  This episode shows that Madison and others present considered allowing principal officers \nbelow the rank of Head of Department to appoint some inferior officers, but the convention \nunanimously decided not to accept that loosening of the appointments authority under the \nExcepting Clause.  The Framers never even considered authorizing inferior officers to appoint \nother inferior officers.  And it is evident that they took for granted that Heads of Department \nwould be principal officers—in Madison’s words, there were other “Superior” or principal \nofficers “below” the rank of Head of Department. \n  A handful of judicial statements support an understanding of the Excepting Clause that \nwould preclude inferior officers from appointing other inferior officers.  Numerous decisions \nstress that the Framers sought to prevent “the diffusion of the appointment power.”  Freytag v. \nComm’r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 878 (1991).  In Freytag, the Supreme Court further \nobserved that the Framers confined the term “Heads of Department” to ensure that those with the \nappointment power “are subject to the exercise of political oversight and share the President’s \naccountability to the people.”  Id. at 886.  Justice Scalia’s concurring opinion is to the same \neffect.  He wrote: “Like the President,” heads of departments “possess a reputational stake in the \nquality of the individuals they appoint; and though they are not themselves able to resist \ncongressional encroachment, they are directly answerable to the President, who is responsible to \nhis constituency for their appointments and has the motive and means to assure faithful actions \nby his direct lieutenants.”  Id. at 907 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Although acting department heads \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 46 of 75\nremain direct lieutenants of the President, and are within the President’s removal power (at least \nfrom the acting post), accountability is nevertheless diminished as the power to determine who \nwill run a department is passed on to inferior officers, including those who were not themselves \nappointed by the President. \n  Similarly, the Supreme Court observed in Printz v. United States that “[t]he Constitution \ndoes not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the President, it \nsays ‘shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,’ Art. II, § 3, personally and through \nofficers whom he appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress may authorize to be \nappointed by the ‘Courts of Law’ or by ‘Heads of Departments’ who are themselves Presidential \nappointees.”  521 U.S. 898, 922 (1997).  Yet, under the broad reading of 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) \nthat Defendants press, any DHS officer who became Acting Secretary under that provision \nwould then be able to determine who would run one of the most important Departments in the \ngovernment. \n  Defendants counter that their broader reading of § 113(g)(2) raises no constitutional \nconcerns at all.  Dkt. 69 at 26.  For support, they rely almost exclusively on the D.C. Circuit’s \nrecent decision in In re Grand Jury Investigation, 916 F.3d at 1055–56.  That case concerned \nwhether the Deputy Attorney General had authority to appoint a Special Counsel when acting in \nplace of the Attorney General, who was recused from the matter at hand.  Id. at 1051.  In holding \nthat the Deputy Attorney General possessed that power, the D.C. Circuit explained that the \nAttorney General is the Head of the Department for purposes of the Appointments Clause, but \nwhen the Deputy Attorney General acts as the Attorney General, he “becomes the head of the \nDepartment . . . because an acting officer is vested with the same authority that could be \nexercised by the officer for whom he acts.”  Id. at 1055.  The appellant countered by arguing that \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 47 of 75\n28 U.S.C. § 508, which governs vacancies in the Office of Attorney General, “does not make the \nDeputy Attorney General an ‘acting’ officer but only authorizes the Deputy Attorney General to \nperform the duties of the Attorney General’s office and the Attorney General remains the ‘Head \nof Department’ for Appointments Clause purposes.”  Id. at 1056.  But the D.C. Circuit was \nunconvinced, holding that “Congress has authorized the Deputy Attorney General to perform ‘all \nthe duties of th[e] office’ in case of vacancy, . . . such that the Deputy becomes the ‘Acting’ \nAttorney General.”  Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 508(a)).  “[T]he Acting Attorney General,” in turn, \n“has authority to appoint inferior officers because that is part of the authority that could be \nexercised by the Attorney General.”  Id. \n  In re Grand Jury Investigation does not answer the question whether inferior officers can \nappoint other inferior officers because, when the Deputy Attorney General serves as the Acting \nAttorney General or exercises the authorities of that office, he almost certainly serves as a \nprincipal officer.  This is because the Deputy Attorney General is appointed by the President \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate and, more importantly, the same statute that establishes \nthe office of Deputy Attorney General entrusts the Deputy Attorney General to perform the \nduties of the office of the Attorney General in case of a vacancy—even a “vacancy” arising by \nreason of a “disability.”  28 U.S.C. § 508(a).  In other words, heading the Department of Justice \nin the Attorney General’s absence is part of the duties of the office of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and when an individual is nominated and confirmed to serve as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, he has been selected for an office that, at least at times, constitutes the senior position in \nthe Department of Justice for which the individual holding that office is answerable to the \nPresident alone.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662–63.  When serving in that capacity, the Deputy \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 48 of 75\nAttorney General is a principal officer and is, at least arguably, the “Head of the Department” in \nthe constitutional sense. \n  An analogous inquiry applies when Congress assigns new duties to an existing office, \nwhich in some instances threatens to circumvent the Appointments Clause.  As the Supreme \nCourt held in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U.S. 282, 300–01 (1893), two requirements must \nbe satisfied for Congress to assign additional duties to an existing office.  First, the duties must \nbe assigned to the office and not the officer.  See Olympic Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Dir., Office \nof Thrift Supervision, 732 F. Supp. 1183, 1192 (D.D.C. 1990).  Second, the new duties must be \n“germane to the offices already held” by the officer at issue.  Shoemaker, 147 U.S. at 301; see \ngenerally Weiss, 510 U.S. 163 (unanimously holding that PAS military officers may be assigned \nto serve as military judges).  Justice Scalia’s concurring opinion in Weiss is particularly helpful \nin considering the question raised here.  Justice Scalia wrote: \nGermaneness analysis must be conducted, it seems to me, whenever that is \nnecessary to assure that the conferring of new duties does not violate the \nAppointments Clause. Violation of the Appointments Clause occurs not only \nwhen (as in Shoemaker) Congress may be aggrandizing itself (by effectively \nappropriating the appointment power over the officer exercising the new duties), \nbut  also  when  Congress,  without  aggrandizing  itself,  effectively  lodges \nappointment power in any person other than those whom the Constitution \nspecifies. Thus, “germaneness” is relevant whenever Congress gives power to \nconfer new duties to anyone other than the few potential recipients of the \nappointment power specified in the Appointments Clause—i.e., the President, \nthe Courts of Law, and Heads of Departments.   \n \nId. at 196 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  That reasoning extends \nto the present context.4 \n                                                           \n4  Rejecting Justice Scalia’s view, the Weiss majority concluded that military judges were \nconstitutionally authorized to serve by virtue of their appointment as commissioned officers of \nthe Armed Forces.  510 U.S. at 172–76.  That conclusion is inapposite here, however, because \nthe Supreme Court relied on the unique nature of the military, including the court’s conclusion \nthat the military “remains a ‘specialized society separate from civilian society,’” in which “all \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 49 of 75\n  To start, the Department is an exceptionally large and diverse federal agency that \ncomprises USCIS, the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Cybersecurity \nand Infrastructure Security Agency, FEMA, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, and multiple directorates and offices, which combined employ more than \n240,000 people.  See About DHS (last updated July 5, 2019), https://www.dhs.gov/about-dhs; \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security, \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_1205_dhs-organizational-chart.pdf.  \nThese varied agencies have different missions, subject areas, and jurisdictions; it is likely that \nmany “officers” serving in the Department were not presidentially appointed and Senate \nconfirmed; and it borders on the inconceivable that Congress envisioned that the duties of each \nof these diverse offices would include serving as the “Head of Department,” even on a temporary \nbasis.  Most importantly, if each “officer” serving in any of those offices and agencies were \nsubject to designation as the Acting Secretary—and, if each of those individuals could then, in \nturn, set a new order of succession, effectively designating the next Acting Secretary—the “few \npotential recipients of the appointment power specified in the Appointments Clause” would \narguably expand beyond constitutional limits.  Weiss, 510 U.S. at 196 (Scalia, J., concurring).  \nThe reason Congress can vest authority to make appointments of inferior officers in the Deputy \nAttorney General or, by the same reasoning, the Deputy Secretary, is that the authority to assume \nthe role as “Head of Department” is inherent in the job for which they were constitutionally \n                                                           \nmilitary officers, consistent with a long tradition, play a role in the operation of the military \njustice system.”  520 U.S. at 174–75 (quoting Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 743 (1974)).  Nor \ndid the Supreme Court face the question in that case of whether the Appointments Clause \npermits inferior officers to act as “Heads of Department” in filling the most senior positions in \ngovernment, even on a temporary basis.   \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 50 of 75\nappointed.  That theory, however, would (at least arguably) stretch to the breaking point if \nextended, as Defendants urge, to any of the dozens of individuals serving as “officers” at DHS. \n  The D.C. Circuit’s reasoning in In re Grand Jury Investigation thus does not dictate the \nresult here; the Deputy Attorney General is differently situated than the many inferior officers \nDefendants would permit to appoint not just inferior officers but the individual charged with \nheading the Department.  Nor do the other cases cited by the Court in In re Grand Jury \nInvestigation and by Defendants in their briefs stand for the proposition that inferior officers may \nappoint other inferior officers.  To be sure, in the two Supreme Court cases cited in In re Grand \nJury Investigation, both from 1890—Ryan v. United States, 136 U.S. 68, 81 (1890), and Keyser \nv. Hitz, 133 U.S. 138, 145–46 (1890)—the Court observed that acting officials may exercise all \nthe powers of the office in which they are serving.  But both cases dealt with statutes that \npermitted only an officer’s first assistant to act in his place, and the governing statutes in both \ncases expressly empowered the acting official to “perform the duties” of the office.  Thus, in In \nre Grand Jury, Ryan, and Keyser, Congress expressly vested the first assistants at issue with the \nauthority to exercise the duties and functions of the vacant office, just as Congress has done for \nthose acting officers, including the DHS Deputy Secretary, who are serving pursuant to the \nFVRA.  That is a much different statutory context than a provision that allows the DHS \n“Secretary” to “designate such other officers of the Department” as she deems appropriate “to \nserve as Acting Secretary”—without any elaboration about what duties come with that \ndesignation or whether any statutory distinction exists between the “Secretary” and the “Acting \nSecretary.” \n  The fact that McAleenan, Wolf, and Gaynor all ascended to the post of Acting Secretary \nfrom their own PAS positions is irrelevant.  In interpreting the statute, the Court must consider \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 51 of 75\nwhether any application of the provision as interpreted by Defendants would raise constitutional \nconcern, not whether a different statute whose scope was limited to only the facts of this case \nwould raise the same concerns.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 380–81 (2005) (“[W]hen \ndeciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must consider the \nnecessary consequences of its choice.  If one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional \nproblems, the other should prevail—whether or not those constitutional problems pertain to the \nparticular litigant before the Court.”).  The fact that McAleenan, Wolf, and Gaynor were all \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate (to posts below that of Secretary or \nDeputy Secretary), is happenstance for purposes of Defendants’ reading of § 113(g)(2). \n  That said, a simple textual argument supports Defendants’ position that inferior officers \nwho are serving as the head of their department may appoint other inferior officers.  In the most \nliteral of terms, one can argue that such an official is, for all intents and purposes, the “Head of \nDepartment.”  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 513 \n(2010) (quoting the Classification Act of 1923, which provides that “the head of the department” \nmeans “the officer or group of officers . . . who are not subordinate or responsible to any other \nofficer of the department”).  But it seems implausible that the Framers understood the term \n“Heads of Department” to include inferior officers, as Madison’s failed argument in opposition \nto the Excepting Clause suggests. \n  For present purposes, however, the Court need not resolve this difficult constitutional \nquestion.  As explained above, based on the text, structure, and purpose of the statute, the Court \nreads § 113(g)(2) as vesting in only the PAS Secretary the authority to “designate such other \nofficers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”  6 \nU.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  And that reading has the additional benefit of avoiding any constitutional \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 52 of 75\nconcerns.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019); Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. \n830, 842 (2018); Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857–58 (2014); Nw. Austin Mun. Util. \nDist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 197 (2009).  The Court does not employ the \nconstitutional avoidance canon lightly.  A court may not manufacture an ambiguity merely for \nthe purposes of invoking the canon, nor may it avoid what is, upon thorough scrutiny, anything \nless than a serious and previously unanswered constitutional quandary.  But here, where avoiding \na serious, unaddressed constitutional problem merely confirms the Court’s reading of the \nstatutory text, the canon fits.  The Court therefore concludes that “Secretary” in § 113(g)(2) does \nnot include an Acting Secretary, but instead means the PAS Secretary and only the PAS \nSecretary.  Id. \n  This conclusion has an important implication for Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success in their \nchallenge to the validity of the Proposed and Final Rules.  In Section II.B.1.a above, the Court \nconcluded that Wolf’s ratification of those rules was likely effective.  But Wolf (or, more \nprecisely, the office that he held) was initially designated to serve as Acting Secretary by \nMcAleenan and was later redesignated as Acting Secretary by Gaynor.  Both McAleenan and \nGaynor were serving in an acting capacity when they made those designations.  Because the \nCourt holds that an Acting Secretary may not amend the Department’s order of succession \nunder § 113(g)(2), neither appointment of Wolf was effective.  Moreover, because Gaynor could \nnot amend the order of succession to put Wolf next in line, Wolf acted without authority when he \napproved the Final Rule and when he attempted to ratify the Proposed Rule and the Final Rule.  \nAs such, in the absence of valid ratification, both actions were “not in accordance with law” and \n“in excess of . . . authority” under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claim that the Rule was adopted without lawful authority. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 53 of 75\n2.   APA Claims   \nPlaintiffs also raise a host of claims under the APA.  Some of these claims assert that the \nRule is arbitrary and capricious, Dkt. 50 at 38–49, while others assert that DHS failed to provide \nadequate notice and comment, id. at 33–37.  Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are \nlikely to prevail on the first set of these APA claims, the Court will address only those claims \nand will leave Plaintiffs’ remaining APA claims for another day. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious for a multitude of reasons, \nmost of which turn, at least in part, on DHS’s alleged failure to consider adequately and to \nexplain how, if at all, the fee increases and reduced fee waivers will affect demand for important \nimmigration benefits.  That failure, in Plaintiffs’ view, prevented DHS from making meaningful \nestimates about how much revenue the new fees would likely raise (i.e., the Department \nconsidered price but not demand) and prevented it from grappling with the significant \nconsequences that the Rule will have on the provision of immigration benefits (i.e., the \nDepartment failed to consider the human consequences of raising the price for important \nbenefits, like asylum, naturalization, suspension of removal, and work authorization).  To make \nmatters worse, Plaintiffs continue, DHS failed to address its prior conclusions regarding the \nlikely effect that large fee increases would have on the ability of the Department to serve low-\nincome populations, failed to consider studies submitted by commenters, and made a series of \nconflicting pronouncements about the elasticity of demand for immigration benefits.  Overall, \nPlaintiffs contend that the Rule offered nothing more than conclusory and conflicting assertions \nin response to comments challenging the core assumptions and consequences of the Rule.   \nDefendants disagree with each of these contentions.  They argue that DHS reasonably \nconcluded that the fee increases were necessary to cover the costs incurred by USCIS in \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 54 of 75\nproviding immigration benefits; reasonably concluded that a “beneficiary-pays” model is more \nequitable than an “ability-to-pay” model; and reasonably determined that even low-income \nbeneficiaries who do not qualify for a fee waiver will find a way to pay for the uniquely \nattractive benefits accorded to qualified immigrants.  For the reasons explained below, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have the better of the arguments. \nThe APA “requires agencies to engage in reasoned decisionmaking.”  DHS v. Regents of \nthe Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1905 (2020) (quotation omitted).  “Not only must an agency’s \ndecreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority, but the process by which it reaches that \nresult must be logical and rational.”  Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, \n374 (1998).  An agency must also “reasonably reflect upon the information contained in the \nrecord and grapple with contrary evidence,” Fred Meyer Stores, Inc. v. NLRB, 865 F.3d 630, 638 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017), and, if the rule departs from the agency’s previous position, the agency must \nexplain why it does so, FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009).  The \nagency need not demonstrate that the new rule is “better,” but it must offer “a reasoned \nexplanation . . . for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the \nprior policy.”  Id.  To be sure, the “scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard \nis narrow[,] and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency,” Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 30 (1983), but the \nagency must reach its judgment—whatever it may be—by considering the relevant material and \nmaking a reasoned decision. \n“[R]easonable regulation,” according to the Supreme Court, “ordinarily requires paying \nattention to the advantages and the disadvantages of agency decisions.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 \nU.S. 743, 753 (2015).  This consideration goes beyond analyzing costs of compliance or revenue \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 55 of 75\ndirectly generated by a regulation and extends to “any disadvantage” associated with an agency \nrule.  Id. at 752.  Plaintiffs and Defendants seem to agree that one such “cost” or “disadvantage” \nof the Final Rule that DHS was required to consider was whether—and, if so, to what extent—\nthe Rule would interfere with the ability of low-income applicants to obtain the covered benefits.  \nAnd, relatedly, all seem to agree that DHS could only rationally assess the fee generating \ncapacity of the Rule by making informed judgments about the likely effect of the rule on demand \nfor the covered benefits.  The parties disagree, however, about whether DHS adequately \nconsidered whether and how the Rule would affect the accessibility and demand for immigration \nbenefits among low-income individuals.   \nAlthough Plaintiffs contend that their criticisms of the Rule “cut across the entire rule,” \nDkt. 77 at 18, they focus on the most substantial fee increases for some of the most important \nimmigration benefits.  To start, Plaintiffs note that the Rule “nearly doubles the naturalization fee \n(to $1,170 for a paper filing) and eliminates the reduced fee option.”  Dkt. 50 at 20.  The Rule \nalso “imposes non-waivable charges on asylum seekers for applications that never previously \nhad a fee: a $50 application fee, plus a $550 application and a $30 biometrics fee for a first \nemployment authorization application.”  Id.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 56 of 75\nThe following table reflects the changes for each of these services over the past several \nfee revisions:   \nApplication description  Oct. 2005  July 2007  Nov. 2010  Dec. 2016  Aug. 2020 \nN-400 Application for  $330  $595  $595  $640;  $1,170 \nNaturalization Paper  reduced fee \nFiling  of $320 \navailable \nI-589 Application for  0  0  0  0  $50 \nasylum and for \nwithholding of removal \nI-765 Application for  $180  $340  $380  $410; 0 for  $550 \nEmployment  asylum \nAuthorization   seekers \nBiometric Services  $70  $80  $85  $85; 0 for  $30 \n(Non-DACA)  asylum \nseekers \n \nFinal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,791–92; Dkt. 74-1 at 53–55.  For present purposes, the Court \nfocuses on the first four of these fees. \na.  Naturalization Fees   \nAs the table reflects, the Final Rule almost doubles the fee to apply for naturalization for \nthose who previously paid full price and almost triples the cost for applicants who previously \nqualified for a reduced fee.  “In crafting prior fee rules, DHS reasoned that setting the Form N-\n400 fee at an amount less than its estimated costs and shifting those costs to other fee payers was \nappropriate in order to promote naturalization and immigrant integration.”  Proposed Rule, 84 \nFed. Reg. at 62,316.  Finding that this cost shifting was “not equitable,” DHS adjusted \nnaturalization fees to “recover the full cost” of naturalization adjudication “as well as a \nproportion of costs not recovered by other forms for which fees are limited or must be offered a \nwaiver by statute.”  Id. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 57 of 75\nDHS received numerous comments on this issue.  See, e.g., Dkt. 78-1.  Commenters \npointed to data showing that naturalization fees discourage immigrants from applying and \nposited that the substantial increase in the Form N-400 fee would “act as a barrier to immigrants \nwith middle or lower class income,” causing hardships to immigrants and potentially frustrating \nthe Rule’s stated goal of improving USCIS’s finances.  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,857.  \nBecause lawful residents can opt to renew their green cards at a lower cost than applying for \nnaturalization, commenters explained, immigrants are especially price sensitive to naturalization \nfees.  Dkt. 78-1 at 57.  Those immigrants who choose to renew their green cards retain some \nbenefits, like “the right to work legally, but forego the full privileges associated with becoming \ncitizens.”  Id.  Several commenters, moreover, backed up their concerns with empirics.   \nThe comments offered by Project Citizenship reflect the type of detailed evidence \npresented to DHS regarding the elasticity of demand among low-income applicants for \nnaturalization.  Project Citizenship first explained that the Proposed Rule would “increase the \napplication fee for the N-400 naturalization form by about 83% from $640 to $1,170” and that, \n“[t]o add insult to injury, the Proposed Rule [would] completely eliminate fee waivers and \nreduced fees for citizenship applications.”  Dkt. 78-1 at 55.  This “fee hike” and the “elimination \nof fee waiver and reduced fee programs” would, in Project Citizenship’s view, “price many \nindividuals out of citizenship and [would] create a de facto wealth requirement.”  Id.  To back \nthis up, Project Citizenship pointed to the following evidence: \n[I]n one survey, about 18% of Latino lawful permanent residents cited financial \nand administrative barriers as one of the main reasons they had not naturalized.  \nSee Ana Gonzalez-Barrera et al., The Path Not Taken: Two-Thirds of Legal \nMexican Immigrants Are Not U.S. Citizens, Pew Research Center, 6 (Feb. 4, \n2013),  http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/02/04/the-path-not-taken/.    The \nsurvey further showed that “Hispanic immigrants who have not yet naturalized \nsay they ‘would’ naturalize if they could.”  Id.  Research has also shown that \nincreases in application fees for naturalization have significantly impacted the \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 58 of 75\ncomposition of the population that naturalizes.  For instance, an analysis of \nnaturalization data demonstrated that “the price increases for naturalization in \n2004 and 2007 are a significant barrier to citizenship for less educated and lower \nincome immigrants” and that “the decision by an immigrant to naturalize is price \nsensitive, especially in relation to the less risky and less expensive alternative—\nrenewing one’s Green Card.”  Pastor et al., Nurturing Naturalization: Could \nLowering the Fee Help?[,] The National Partnership for New Americans, 17 \n(February  2013), \nhttp://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/731/docs/Nuturing_Naturalization_final_we\nb.pdf (“Pastor”). \n \n. . . .  \n \nA recent Stanford study found that higher application fees prevent a substantial \nportion of low-income immigrants who wish to naturalize from applying for \ncitizenship.  See Hainmueller et al., A Randomized Controlled Design Reveals \nBarriers to Citizenship for Low-Income Immigrants, 115(5) PNAS USA 939 \n(2018).  The study tested two programmatic interventions among low-income \nimmigrants eligible for citizenship: (i) vouchers that cover the cost of the \napplication fee; and (ii) a set of behavior nudges, similar to existing interventions \nused by immigrant service providers.  The results showed that “offering the fee \nvoucher increased naturalization application rates by about 41%, suggesting that \napplication fees act as a barrier for low-income immigrants who want to become \nUS citizens” and that “the financial barrier is a real and binding constraint.”  Id. \nat 939, 941. \n \nAnother recent study assessing policy interventions to increase naturalization \nrates found that the introduction and standardization of a fee waiver form by \nUSCIS (Form I-912) had the highest positive effect on naturalization by lawful \npermanent residents (“LPRs”) with lower incomes, lower English-language \nskills, and lower education levels.  See Yasenov et al., Standardizing the Fee-\nWaiver Application Increased Naturalization Rates of Low-Income Immigrants, \n116(534) PNAS USA 16768 (2019) (“Yasenov”).  The results thus demonstrated \nthat “difficulties accessing the fee waiver are barriers to citizenship for low-\nincome LPRs.”  Id. at 16772. \n \n. . . . \n \nStudies have shown that changes in naturalization rates correlate with changes \nin naturalization application fees.  For example, in 1970, 64% of legal foreign-\nborn residents had become citizens while in 2011, only 56% had become \ncitizens.  The application fee has increased from $35 (or $80.25 in 2017 dollars) \nin 1985 to $725 in 2017. . . .  Another report showed that although the across-\nthe-board 1999 fee increases did not cause significant change in other USCIS \napplications, there was a significant drop in N-400 applications.  See Pastor at \n6-7.  Furthermore in 2007, when the N-400 fee increased from $330 to $595, a \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 59 of 75\nsurge to about 1.4 million naturalization applications preceded the fee hike, \nfollowed by a sharp decline to about 500,000 applications in 2008.  Id. at 7.   \n \nDkt. 78-1 at 56–58. \nDHS’s response to this and similar comments, see, e.g., id. at 70–71, 133–37, 159, is both \ninconsistent and inadequate.  The Department asserts, for example, that it “does not know the \nprice elasticity of demand for immigration benefits, nor does [it] know the level at which the fee \nincreases become too high for applicants/petitioners to apply.”  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n46,797.  But, notwithstanding the Department’s admitted dearth of knowledge, it goes on to \nassert that it “disagrees that the fees will result in the negative effects the commenters suggested” \nbecause it “believes that immigration to the United States remains attractive to millions of \nindividuals around the world and that its benefits continue to outweigh the costs noted by the \ncommenters.”  Id.  And, again, with no analysis or response to the cited studies, the Department \nasserts that it “believes” that “the price elasticity for immigration services is inelastic and \nincreases in price will have no impact on the demand for these services” and that “[t]his is true \nfor all immigration services impacted by this rule.”  Id. (emphasis added).  In addition, despite \nstudies referenced in the administrative record showing that “fee increases have a disparate racial \nimpact,” Dkt. 78-1 at 70, and without any meaningful analysis, DHS rejected the contention that \nthe Proposed Rule would have “any . . . discriminatory . . . effect.”  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n46,797.  Finally, without acknowledging its prior assertion that the price increases (and reduced \nwaivers) will have “no impact on the demand” for any of the “immigration services” at issue, id., \nDHS acknowledges in a later passage of the Final Rule that “the increase[d price] for the \nnaturalization application may affect those applying,” only to then return to the premise that \n“most individuals will continue to value American citizenship, even if it is more expensive to \nnaturalize,” id. at 46,857–58. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 60 of 75\nThe only empirical response DHS offers pales in comparison to the studies cited in the \npublic comments.  It asserts: “DHS saw no or limited decreases in the number of benefit requests \nsubmitted after its fee adjustments in 2007, 2010, and 2016 (e.g., N-400 filings volumes grew \nfrom less than 600,000 in FY 2009 to approximately 750,000 in FY 2011; similarly, N-400 filing \nvolumes grew from less than 800,000 in FY 2015 to nearly 1 million FY 2017).”  Id. at 46,799– \n800.  It is difficult to know what to make of this assertion, however, because the Department \noffers data only with respect to N-400 filings, and that data fails to address any period of time \nwhen a significant across-the-board increase in the cost of applying for naturalization occurred—\nmuch less an increase approaching the magnitude of the increase at issue here.  Commenters \nreferenced a study finding that naturalization applications decreased after the substantial N-400 \nfee hike in 2007, Dkt. 78-1 at 58, but the Department does not compare pre-2007 and post-2007 \nN-400 filing rates.  Instead, it points to the increase in applications from FY 2009 to FY 2011, \nbut, as shown in the table above, it appears that the fee remained stable during this time period; it \nwas $595 in July 2007 and remained at that rate when prices were adjusted in November 2010.  \nAnd, although the fee for applying for naturalization increased between 2015 and 2017, the price \nincrease was only $45 and, more importantly, USCIS simultaneously introduced the reduced fee \nof $320 for certain low-income applicants.  But, even beyond these unexplained shortcomings, \nthe Department’s single sentence comparing application rates fails to control for any other \nvariables and, in the face of the studies offered by the commenters, falls far short of DHS’s \nobligation to “grapple with contrary evidence.”  Fred Meyer Stores, 865 F.3d at 638.   \nBeyond the Department’s anemic reliance on historical application rates, it offers nothing \nof substance to rebut or to “grapple with” the evidence that an 83% price hike, accompanied with \nthe abandonment of fee waivers and reduced fees for low-income applicants, will dissuade a \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 61 of 75\nsignificant number of low-income applicants from applying to naturalize.  The Department \nrepeatedly acknowledges the concern but remains unconvinced that it is likely to materialize.  \nCourts, however, “do not defer to [an] agency’s conclusory or unsupported suppositions.” \nNetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 539 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. \nDep’t of the Air Force, 375 F.3d 1182, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 2004)), superseded by statute, Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 \n(2010); United Techs. Corp. v. DOD, 601 F.3d 557, 562 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (same).  To be sure, \nagencies need not accept uncritically any evidence submitted in comments during rulemaking, \nbut they must provide reasons for disregarding the evidence, especially when the contrary \nevidence is substantial. See Genuine Parts Co. v. EPA, 890 F.3d 304, 312 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(“Conclusory explanations for matters involving a central factual dispute where there is \nconsiderable evidence in conflict do not suffice to meet the deferential standards of our review.” \n(citation omitted)); Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Mine Safety and Health Admin., \n626 F.3d 84, 87, 93–94 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (An agency’s unexplained reliance on its own \n“knowledge and expertise” is “inadequate when expert evidence in the rulemaking record” runs \ncontrary to the agency’s decision). \nThe Final Rule also fails to address the Department’s prior, conflicting conclusions \nregarding the potential impact of large fees on low-income applicants.  In 2010, for example, \nDHS declined to raise the fee for naturalization based on “the importance of immigrant \nintegration” and the interest in “promot[ing] citizenship.”  2010 Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 58,975.  \nSimilarly, in 2016, DHS limited the increase in the Form N-400 fee to 8% and provided a \nreduced fee of $320 for applicants with family incomes greater than 150% of the FPG (those \nwith incomes below that level were entitled to a fee waiver) but no more than 200% of the FPG \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 62 of 75\n“to help ensure that those who have worked hard to become eligible for naturalization are not \nlimited by their economic means.”  2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 73,296–97.  On both occasions, \nDHS acted based on the premise that large fee increases would pose an obstacle to naturalization \nfor low-income families.  Yet, in the 2020 Final Rule, DHS adopted the opposite premise and \nposited that “increases in price will have no impact on the demand for these services.”  Final \nRule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,797.  Agencies are, of course, allowed to change their views over time.  \nBut when doing so they must offer a “reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and \ncircumstances that underlay or were engendered by prior policy.”  Fox, 556 U.S. at 515–16.  \nHere, however, DHS shifted from its prior “aware[ness] of the potential impact of fee increases \non low-income individuals,” 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 73,297, to a belief that “increases in \nprice will have no impact on the demand for . . . services,” Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,797, \nwithout explanation.  Such an unexplained change is unlikely to withstand APA scrutiny. \nFinally, even if DHS had recognized that an 83% fee increase, along with unavailability \nof fee waivers or reduced fees, might prevent certain low-income immigrants from applying for \nnaturalization, the Rule would still fail APA requirements because DHS never considered the \nhardship that the Rule might impose on those individuals.  See Michigan, 576 U.S. at 753.  \nAlthough DHS did recite several of the hardships outlined by commenters, see, e.g., Final Rule, \n85 Fed. Reg. at 46,859–60, it dismissed these concerns by merely repeating the unsupported \n“belie[f]” that the price increase would not deter applicants.  A mere recitation of significant \ncomments followed by a conclusory statement “is not a hallmark of reasoned decisionmaking.”  \nGresham v. Azar, 950 F.3d 93, 103 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  Confronted with calls to “account for the \nharm posed by increased naturalization fees such as reduced wages, broken families, and \nincreased vulnerability to domestic violence,” Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,881, DHS did \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 63 of 75\n“acknowledge that some individuals will need to save, borrow, or use a credit card in order to \npay fees,” id. at 46,797, but it failed to consider that burden in weighing the costs and benefits of \nthe Rule and failed to consider the impact the Rule would have on those unable to borrow the \nnecessary funds.  Instead, without analysis or support, it merely “disagree[d] that the fees will \nresult in the negative effects” suggested by comments.  Id. at 46,881.   \nb.  Asylum Fees \nThe Final Rule also makes significant changes with respect to those seeking asylum.  For \nthe first time, asylum seekers must pay to apply.  When filing an application for asylum and \nwithholding of removal, asylum seekers must now pay a non-waivable $50 fee, an amount that \ndoes not recover costs but will “generate some revenue to offset costs.”  Id. at 46,844.  In \naddition, the Final Rule requires asylum seekers to pay a $550 employment authorization fee and \na $30 biometrics fee.  Id. at 46,833, 46,852.  \nIn proposing the $50 fee, DHS explained that it chose the amount because it would “not \nbe so high as to be unaffordable to even an indigent alien.”  Proposed Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n62,320.   Commenters, however, offered reasons to doubt that assumption.  Among other things, \nthe comments noted that “[a]sylum seekers in detention . . . earn at most $1 a day;” some asylum \nseekers “need to quickly flee situations of peril” and might not have the opportunity to save; and \n“[a]sylum seekers are often minors with no means to support themselves and therefore cannot \nafford an asylum fee.”  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,845.  In response, the Department \nobserved that the Rule exempts “unaccompanied alien children in removal proceedings” from the \n$50 fee, but otherwise simply stated that “DHS considered the effect of the fees on asylum \nseekers and believe[d] the fees would not impose an unreasonable burden on applicants or \nprevent asylum seekers from seeking protection.”  Id.; see also id. at 46,850 (“DHS believes the \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 64 of 75\nminimal fee of $50 is not unreasonably burdensome and does not prevent legitimate asylum \nseekers from submitting asylum applications.”).  In response to a comment that the Department \ndid not consider the cost to families and communities that must help cover asylum seekers’ fees, \nDHS acknowledged that it “did not consider [these] costs” and “recognize[d] that these families \nand communities will have to find a way to pay, whether through their communities, friends, \nloans, or credit cards,” but moved on without further discussion.  Id. at 46,881–82.  The agency \nthen stated that it could not “accurately or reliably predict how many applicants would no longer \napply for asylum as [a] result of the $50 fee,” seemingly contradicting its assertions elsewhere in \nthe Final Rule that the fee would have no deterring effect.  Id. at 46,882.  None of these \nresponses deal in a meaningful way with the comments regarding the very limited means of \ncertain asylum seekers and possible effect of even a $50 fee on the availability of an important \nimmigration benefit.  To be sure, DHS also stresses the role the $50 fee will play in “generating \nsome revenue to offset [the] costs” of the Department’s “growing affirmative asylum workload” \nand the strain that those costs are placing “on the administration of other immigration benefit \nrequests.”  Id. at 46,850.  But that rationale stands apart from the Department’s assurances that \nthe increased fee will be “affordable” for even indigent asylum seekers and that it will not \n“prevent legitimate asylum seekers from submitting asylum applications.”  Id.  To the extent \nDHS premised its decision on that empirical judgment, as the Final Rule asserts, the Department \nwas required to explain why the conflicting comments were wrong. \nCommenters also criticized “the change to charge asylum applicants [a $550 fee] for their \nfirst Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.”  Id. at 46,851.  As those \ncommenters explained, “[a]sylum seekers have historically not been charged for their initial \nEAD [employment authorization document] because their flight from their country of origin \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 65 of 75\nleaves them in dire financial situations, and they often lack family support in the United States to \nassist them.”  Id.  According to commenters, this creates a conflict for asylum seekers, who \n“cannot work to pay their asylum fees,” leading some “people to work illegally.”  Id. at 46,852.  \nIn response, DHS noted that asylum applicants are not permitted to receive work “authorization \nbefore 180 days have passed since the filing of his or her asylum application” and that, as a \nresult, they are “unlikely to come to the United States expecting to be authorized to work \nimmediately” and must, instead, “rely on their own means, as well as family or community \nsupport to economically sustain themselves in the United States during the period of time that \nthey are not employment authorized.”  Id.  Presumably based on this assessment, the Department \nfurther concluded that it “does not believe the . . . fee is unduly burdensome.”  Id.; see also id. at \n46,853.  Again, the Department’s consideration of the issue is based on speculation regarding \napplicants’ ability to pay. \nCommenters also raised concerns that the $550 fee would put asylum seekers (and \nparticularly women) at risk of “hunger, abuse, homelessness, trafficking, and other coercive \nemployment practices.”  Id.  The Court does not doubt that DHS had the discretion to adopt the \n$550 fee despite these risks.  But that is not what the Department claimed to do; rather, it said \nthat “DHS does not believe that this final rule hinders or prevents asylum seekers from applying \nfor employment authorization.”  Id. And that assertion is, once again, unsupported by any data or \nmeaningful analysis. \n DHS also added a $30 biometric services fee for asylum seekers applying for \nemployment authorization.  Id. at 46,833; Dkt. 50 at 37; Dkt. 69 at 37.  Although the parties spar \nover whether Plaintiffs had adequate notice with respect to this particular fee, which was not \ntreated as a standalone fee until the Final Rule was promulgated, the Court need not decide this \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 66 of 75\nissue because, in any event, the comments provided with respect to the $50 and $550 fees for \nasylum seekers alerted DHS to the risk that an additional $30 fee for employment authorization \ncould further burden applicants or drive them to work illegally.  For the reasons discussed above, \nDHS failed to grapple with the burden this and the other fees will impose on asylum seekers, \nrelying instead on the unsupported assumption that the fees would not “hinder[] or prevent[] \nasylum seekers from applying for employment authorization.”  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg.. at \n46,853.  \n*     *     * \nDefendants make several cross-cutting arguments, none of which undercuts Plaintiffs’ \nshowing that DHS failed to grapple with the effect these fee increases would have on demand for \nthe covered services, how decreased demand would affect the Department’s fiscal analysis, or \nthe extent to which the fee increases would impose barriers to obtaining the benefits at issue or \nwould impose other hardships on the applicants and their families. \nFirst, Defendants maintain that DHS’s thoroughly explained philosophical shift from an \n“ability-to-pay” to a “beneficiary-pays” model was a rough proxy for the policy considerations \nthat Plaintiffs contend the Department ignored.  They reiterate that DHS found “requiring fee-\npaying applicants to subsidize other immigrants’ fees” to be inequitable, that this finding \nconstituted “consider[ation of] the equities of its fee system,” and that therefore DHS adequately \nconsidered harms to applicants unable to pay for fees.  Dkt. 69 at 49.  Had DHS said as much in \nthe rulemaking, that might have sufficed.  But although the Department trumpeted the fairness of \nthe “beneficiary-pays” model, Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,795, it never wrestled with the \ndownsides of that model and, indeed, acted on the unsupported assumption that the “increases in \nprice will have no impact on the demand for the[] services” at issue, id. at 46,797 (emphasis \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 67 of 75\nadded).  To be sure, DHS does, at times, “acknowledge[] that the changes in the fee waiver \nprovisions may impose a burden on applicants,” id. at 46,807, but, when it does so, the \nDepartment fails to go beyond that bare acknowledgement, offers a conclusory response with \nlittle or no analysis, see, e.g., id. (noting that USCIS “accepts credit cards” while recognizing \n“that the use of a credit card may add interest expenses to the fee payment”), or maintains that \nthe price increases, although burdensome, will not affect availability of the services at issue, id. \nat 46,799.  Most notably, Defendants do not point to any instance in the record in which the \nDepartment meaningfully addressed the hardships that applicants would face from the significant \nprice increases.  In each instance, DHS “[n]od[s] to concerns raised . . . only to dismiss them in a \nconclusory manner.”5  Gresham, 950 F.3d at 103.   \nNor is the Court persuaded that DHS adequately addressed the issues Plaintiffs raise by \nnoting that it reviews its fees biennially and, accordingly, “can readjust the fees in its next fee \n                                                           \n5  Defendants identify a handful of places in the Final Rule where DHS ostensibly considered \nwhether increased fees would deter applicants.  Dkt. 69 at 40.  None changes this result.  One \nreference, for example, merely reflects the Department’s conclusion that certain vulnerable \ngroups would still apply for benefits because they would fall into the narrow fee waiver \nexception preserved in the Final Rule.  See Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,815 (stating that “DHS \nbelieves that . . . the final rule will not unduly burden” certain vulnerable populations because \nthey can still apply for a narrower set of fee waivers).  Several other references speak to DHS’s \nintent—specifically, that DHS does not intend the Final Rule to decrease application volume—\nbut says nothing about the potential burdens placed on applicants by new fees.  See id. at 46,795 \n(stating that the agency is increasing fees to meet costs and has no “intent to deter requests from \nlow-income immigrants”); 46,803 (“In adjusting the fees, DHS is not imposing a ‘wealth test.’”); \n46,860 (“DHS wants every person eligible to apply for naturalization to submit an application.”); \n46,884  (“This rule in no way is intended to reduce, limit, or preclude any specific immigration \nbenefit request . . .. While studies indicate that some lawful immigrants who have not naturalized \ncite administrative and financial barriers as a reason for not naturalizing, this alone does not \nestablish that previous fee levels were prohibitive.”); 46,886 (disclaiming deterrence of low-\nincome immigrants as the Rule’s purpose, but acknowledging that immigrants will consider \nearnings and cost when deciding whether to apply for benefits).  The fact that the Department \ndoes not intend to affect application volume, however, if anything, casts a further cloud over its \nfailure to consider whether the Rule will, in fact, do so. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 68 of 75\nrulemaking . . . if necessary.”  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,885.  Although biennial review \nmight justify some judicial leeway when an agency acts in the midst of uncertainty, it does not \npermit the Court to turn a blind eye to flaws in a rule not promulgated in response to an \nemergency or unforeseen circumstances, nor does it permit the Court to accept an agency’s \nunsupported assertions regarding the impact the rule will have on interested parties.  That is \nparticularly true, moreover, where, as here, the Department is not merely increasing fees to \nensure that it can continue to provide necessary services but is, instead, fundamentally altering \nthe model used for over a decade to allocate costs, charging fees to apply for asylum for the first \ntime, and dramatically curtailing the availability of fee waivers and fee reductions for those \napplicants the Department has previously deemed too poor to pay full freight.   \nFinally, even if DHS lacked data to make the judgments that the commenters asked of it, \nthis does not inoculate the Rule against challenge.  See id. at 46,807 (citing a lack of data as \nsupport for assuming individuals will be able to pay heightened fees, despite an admitted burden \nposed by fees); 46,870 (emphasizing the agency’s lack of data by stressing that DHS “simply \ncannot predict all filing changes that will affect actual receipt volumes”).  A lack of data makes \nDHS’s conclusions regarding price insensitivity—including the Department’s belief that “price \nelasticity for immigration services is inelastic and [that] increases in price will have no impact on \nthe demand for these services,” id. at 46,797—more baffling, not less.  “[T]he mere fact that the \nmagnitude of [an effect] is uncertain is no justification for disregarding the effect entirely,” Pub. \nCitizen v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 374 F.3d 1209, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (emphasis in \noriginal), and the Department’s uncertainty provided good reason for it to consider carefully the \nstudies proffered by the commenters, not to ignore or to reject them. \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 69 of 75\nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs have carried their burden of showing \nthat they are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA challenge.  \nC.   Irreparable Injury \nHaving (twice) cleared the first hurdle for issuance of a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs \nmust show that they will suffer an irreparable injury if the Rule is allowed to take effect.  To \nmeet this burden, “the harm must be certain and great . . . and so imminent that there is a clear \nand present need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.”  League of Women Voters v. \nNewby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule will \ninterfere with their ability to provide essential services to their clients and/or members—in some \ncases irretrievably so.  Dkt. 50 at 51–52.  Plaintiffs have offered evidence that, if the Rule takes \neffect, CASA, for example, will “be able to help [only] about 900 members complete the \nnaturalization application process,” as “compared to the 1,500 individuals” the organization \n“helped seek naturalization last year, ” and, as a result, many of its members will be unable to \nvote in time for elections occurring in 2021 and 2022.  Dkt. 50-3 at 12 (Escobar Decl. ¶¶ 38–39).  \nThe Rule will have a similar, immediate effect on NWIRP and Ayuda’s ability to serve their \nclients, Dkt. 50-1 at 4–11 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶¶ 14–27); Dkt. 50-2 at 7–14 (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 21–\n33), including clients who are facing, or will soon face, firm deadlines under the immigration \nlaws, Dkt. 50-1 at 9 (Barón 2d Decl. ¶ 23); Dkt. 50-2 at 12–14 (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 28, 33) \nDefendants do not dispute Plaintiffs’ factual showing of irreparable injury and, indeed, do \nnot even address the irreparable injury requirement.  See Dkt. 69 at 53 (moving from arguments \nagainst Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success directly to the balance of equities).  When asked about \nthis at oral argument, counsel observed that, “in the remedies section of [their] brief, \n[Defendants] note that Plaintiffs have not purported to demonstrate irreparable harm as to certain \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 70 of 75\naspects of the Rule, and that must be taken into consideration.”  Dkt. 77 at 81–82.  To the extent \nthat Defendants urge the Court to tailor a preliminary injunction as narrowly as reasonably \npossible, their proposition is well taken.  But, for purposes of the irreparable injury prong of the \npreliminary injunction standard, Defendants have forfeited any objection they might have.  See \nElec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Presidential Advisory Comm’n on Election Integrity, 878 F.3d 371, \n374 n.1, 379 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (noting that when parties fail to include an argument in \nbriefing and only raise it in oral argument, the argument is forfeit).  And, in any event, the Court \nmust accept Plaintiffs’ unanswered averments as true.  See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 \n(plurality op.) (“[A]ll . . . uncontroverted affidavits filed in support of [a] motion for a \npreliminary injunction are taken as true”). \nAfter briefing and oral argument, Defendants filed a notice highlighting the intervening \norder from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California preliminarily \nenjoining the Rule, arguing that Plaintiffs will not suffer any irreparable injury “unless and until \na stay of” that order “is entered or the agency prevails on any potential appeal.”  Dkt. 81 at 2.  \nPlaintiffs respond that “[o]verlapping injunctions are ‘a common outcome of parallel litigation,’” \nand the “‘existence of another injunction—particularly one in a different circuit that could be \noverturned or limited at any time—does not negate’ plaintiffs’ irreparable harm.”  Dkt. 82 at 1 \n(quoting California v. HHS, 390 F. Supp. 3d 1061, 1065 (N.D. Cal. 2019)). \nTo support their argument, Defendants cite Washington v. Trump, No. CI7-0141JLR, \n2017 WL 4857088, at *7 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 27, 2017), in which the United States District Court \nfor the Western District of Washington postponed its consideration of a temporary restraining \norder after the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii—a court in the same \ncircuit—preliminarily enjoined implementation of the regulation at issue, see Hawaii v. Trump, \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 71 of 75\n265 F. Supp. 3d 1140 (D. Haw. 2017).  Because “the Hawaii federal district court’s injunction \nalready provide[d] Plaintiff[s] . . . with virtually all the relief they” sought, Washington, 2017 \nWL 4857088, at *6, the Western District of Washington determined that “hardship or inequity \nmay result to both parties if the court does not pause to consider issues that will be on appeal in \nthe Ninth Circuit because of the potential for inconsistent rulings and resulting confusion.”  Id. at \n*7 (cleaned up).  In other words, the court exercised its discretion to wait for the input of its own \ngoverning circuit.  By contrast, in California v. HHS, the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of California considered whether to stay preliminary injunction proceedings in \nlight of a nationwide injunction from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania.  390 F. Supp. 3d at 1064.  The Northern District of California distinguished \nWashington v. Trump on the ground that, unlike in that case, it was dealing with a preexisting \npreliminary injunction that was from “a different circuit that could be overturned or limited at \nany time” and thus did “not negate [the Plaintiff’s] claim to irreparable harm.”  Id. at 1066.  The \ncourt added: “[O]verlapping injunctions appear to be a common outcome of parallel litigation, \nrather than a reason for the Court to pass on exercising its duty to determine whether litigants are \nentitled to relief.”  Id. at 1065. \nThe Court is persuaded that the parallel injunction entered in the present dispute does not \nremove the risk that Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury absent action by this Court.  At least \nto date, Defendants have not committed to stand down in the parallel litigation, leaving the \nprospect that the injunction in that case could be stayed or set aside by the Ninth Circuit (or the \nSupreme Court).  And, because this Court’s reasoning does not track that of the Northern District \nof California in all respects, and because this Court is governed by the law of a different circuit, \nthe Court cannot conclude that a stay or decision on the merits from the Ninth Circuit (or the \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 72 of 75\nSupreme Court) would resolve this case.  This conclusion, moreover, has a side benefit relating \nto nationwide injunctions.  If courts were to conclude, as Defendants suggest, that an order \ngranting a nationwide, preliminary injunction in one district was sufficient to shut down all other, \nsimilar litigation, the resolution of important questions would be left to a single district court and \nto a single circuit, losing the benefit of the “airing of competing views” on difficult issues of \nnational importance.  DHS v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in \nthe grant of stay). \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs have carried their burden of \ndemonstrating that they will suffer an irreparable injury in the absence of preliminary injunction. \nD.  Balance of Equities \nPlaintiffs present a compelling list of ways that the Final Rule could cause irreparable \nharm to low-income immigrants.  “When immigrants are unable to afford immigration fees . . . \n[a]n immigrant may have his or her legal status terminated and may become subject to \nremoval[;] . . . asylum [seekers] may be forced back to countries where they risk persecution;” an \nimmigrant may be unable to work legally; and an immigrant may lose access to critical benefits \nonly available to citizens, like Supplemental Security Income, to name a few of the impacts.  \nDkt. 50 at 55.  Defendants respond that “[p]reserving the status quo would require USCIS to \ncontinue to forgo millions of dollars of revenue each day, forcing funding cuts, operational \ncutbacks, personnel furloughs, and further delays adjudicating the very applications Plaintiffs \nclaim the Final Rule will deter.”  Dkt. 69 at 53–54.   \nThe Court must consider the balance of harms against the backdrop of its conclusion that \nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits.  Here, having concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to \nprevail on their claims that the Rule was issued by officials acting without lawful authority and \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 73 of 75\nwas issued in violation of the APA, the Court is persuaded that the public interest weighs in \nfavor of preliminary relief.  As the D.C. Circuit has opined, “[t]here is generally no public \ninterest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at \n12.  “To the contrary, there is a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.’”  Id. (quoting Washington \nv. Reo, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).   \nThe fact that some immigrants might forego important benefits, some irretrievably, while \nothers might postpone naturalization and citizenship, also weighs strongly in favor of granting a \npreliminary injunction.  At the same time, is it far from clear that Defendants would benefit from \na decision that would permit the Rule to take effect, only to be set aside months from now.  That \ntype of on-and-off administration of the immigration laws would do little to address the fiscal \nconcerns and need for fiscal planning that Defendants invoke, while it would engender \nuncertainty, confusion, and unfairness for those subject to the Rule.   \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that the balance of equities tips in favor of interim \nrelief. \n*     *     * \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a \nsubstantial likelihood that they will succeed on the merits; that they will suffer irreparable harm \nif the Final Rule is allowed to take effect; and that the balance of equities weighs in favor of an \ninjunction.  The Court will, accordingly, grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nThat, however, leaves the question of the proper scope of the injunction.   \n“Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often \ndependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 74 of 75\npresents.”  Trump v. Internat’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017).  “The \npurpose of such interim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties, . \n. . but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward” along with “‘the overall public \ninterest.’”  Id. (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 26).   \nApplied in this unique context, the Court concludes that it should stay the effective date \nof the Rule in its entirety, as authorized by the APA, see 5 U.S.C. § 705 (authorizing courts “to \npostpone the effective date of an agency action” to prevent “irreparable injury”), with the \nexception of those fees set by statute.  As the Rule acknowledges, even with the shift from the \n“ability-to-pay” to the “beneficiary-pays” model, the Rule continues to reflect a comprehensive \nbalance, with some fees set at less than full cost balanced against others set at above full costs.  \nSee, e.g., Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,833, 46,856, 46,858.  The Court thus agrees with \nPlaintiffs that the Rule’s provisions are “‘intertwined’” and that enjoining some but not all of the \nRule’s provisions would “‘severely distort’ DHS’s fiscal program.”  Dkt. 74 at 32 (quoting \nCarlson v. Postal Regulatory Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, 351 (D.C. Cir. 2019); MD/DC/DE \nBroadcasters Ass’n v. FCC, 236 F.3d 13, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).  Similarly, even if the Court \ncould discern a way to apply the stay to some but not all applicants—and neither Plaintiffs nor \nDefendants suggest a way to do so—staying the effective date for only some applicants would \nfrustrate the Department’s goal of more equitably allocating costs.  That premise—that all \nsimilarly situated applicants should be treated alike—moreover, is consistent with the interest in \nuniformity in immigration laws.  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394–95 (2012) (quoting \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 4); see also Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. \n99-603, § 115, 100 Stat 3359, 3384 (1986) (“[T]he immigration laws of the United States should \nbe enforced vigorously and uniformly.”).  Finally, because the Court concludes that Wolf acted \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 85   Filed 10/08/20   Page 75 of 75\nwithout authority when he approved the Final Rule and later attempted to ratify that action and \nMcAleenan’s issuance of the Proposed Rule, the legal infirmity at issue reaches all portions of \nthe Rule.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court, accordingly, will GRANT Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and \nwill stay the effective date of the Final Rule (except for those fees set by statute) pending \nresolution of this matter or further order of the Court. \nA separate order will issue. \n \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

Amici curiae—twenty-three cities, counties, and \nelected officials comprising both metropolises like New York City and smaller municipalities \nlike Skokie, Illinois—have a powerful interest in ensuring that their foreign-born residents who \nare eligible to become citizens are provided with fair and reasonable access to the naturalization \nprocess. Nine million people nationwide—hundreds of thousands each in large cities like New \nYork and Los Angeles—meet the criteria for obtaining citizenship.  \nThe challenged rule of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will do lasting and \nirreparable harm not just to the millions of immigrants who are eligible to naturalize, but to the \nmunicipalities they call home. The challenged rule radically increases fees for naturalization \napplications, while at the same time sharply curtailing opportunities for low-income applicants to \nseek waiver or reduction of fees. The impact will be broadly felt: naturalization not only provides \n“a license to a dream,” in the words of  Former Secretary of State and naturalized citizen \nMadeleine Albright,1 but also yields tangible economic benefits for naturalized individuals and \nfor their communities. Immigrants who naturalize have higher earnings, higher employment \nrates, and higher homeownership rates than comparable non-citizens. And municipalities directly \nbenefit from those gains through increased tax income, decreased public benefit expenditures, \nand more stable and engaged communities. \n                                                 \n1 Serena Marshall, Madeleine Albright Welcomes New Citizens, Says America Needs Vitality \nThey Bring (May 24, 2012) ABC NEWS, https://perma.cc/CN55-85E3.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 52   Filed 09/10/20   Page 6 of 17\nAnyone  can  see  that  the  challenged  rule  is  a  deliberate  attempt  to  limit  access  to \ncitizenship, part of a larger nativist campaign by this federal administration. But setting intent to \none  side,  the  rule  will,  as  a  matter  of  simple  economics,  result  in  fewer  naturalization \napplications and fewer citizens. Despite this, at no point during the rulemaking process did DHS \nmeaningfully  grapple  with  how  these  roadblocks  will  cause  profound  harm  not  just  to \nimmigrants, but to their broader communities. The rule is deeply flawed—procedurally and \nsubstantively—and this Court should enjoin its implementation.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Exorbitantly raising fees—while eliminating fee waivers and reductions for most \napplicants—will significantly decrease access to citizenship. \nAlready, cost is a barrier to citizenship for many immigrants. Nearly one-fifth of eligible \nimmigrants who do not naturalize cite cost as the main reason.2 This is a large number of people: \nwhile  almost  nine  million  immigrants  in  the  United  States  meet  the  criteria  for  obtaining \ncitizenship, only about 700,000 naturalize each year.3 The number of eligible individuals whose \nnaturalization is blocked by costs will skyrocket if the DHS rule nearly doubling the application \nfee (from $640 to $1,170) takes effect.  \nCompounding the impact, in addition to sharply increasing the fee, the challenged rule \nalso eliminates the possibility of fee waivers and fee reductions for many eligible applicants. \nCurrently, individuals whose income is less than 150% of the federal poverty level qualify for a \nfull fee waiver and those whose income is between 150% and 200% of the federal poverty level \nqualify for a fee reduction. 8 C.F.R. § 103.7(b)(1)(BBB)(1), (c)(3)(xiii) (2012). These cost-\n                                                 \n2 Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, Mexican Lawful Immigrants Among the Least Likely to Become U.S. \nCitizens, PEW RESEARCH CENTER (June 29, 2017), https://perma.cc/87AF-RQB3.  \n3 MARIA E. ENCHAUTEGUI & LINDA GIANNARELLI, THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF NATURALIZATION \nON IMMIGRANTS AND CITIES 1 (2015), https://perma.cc/W5SP-H2T2.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 52   Filed 09/10/20   Page 7 of 17\nalleviating measures provide critical aid to low-income applicants. Even under the existing, more \nmodest  fee  structure,  a  large  portion  of  applicants  rely  on  these  measures  to  begin  the \nnaturalization process. In 2017, for instance, 40% of naturalization applicants requested a fee \nwaiver nationwide, and many more qualified for the fee reduction.4 But despite this documented \nreliance on fee waivers and reductions, the challenged rule deters naturalization and incentivizes \nnon-citizens to remain so by imposing cost-prohibitive fees on naturalization, while cutting fees \nfor maintaining lawful permanent resident status despite the rule’s ostensible revenue-generating \nrationale. 85 Fed. Reg. 46791 (Aug. 3, 2020).  \n Raising naturalization application fees and eliminating fee waivers and reductions will \nchill naturalization rates across the country. In New York City alone, there are over 620,000 \nlawful permanent residents who are eligible to obtain citizenship, nearly half of whom currently \nqualify for a fee waiver or reduction.5 Similarly, in Los Angeles County, the median income of \nthe nearly 770,000 immigrants eligible to naturalize is under $29,000, meaning that the proposed \napplication fee of $1,170 exceeds two weeks’ gross pay for at least half of potential applicants.6 \nAnd the application fee is just one of the many costs associated with the naturalization process—\nmany immigrants must also pay for English and civics courses, as well as legal and other \nprofessional  assistance.  In  light  of  available  data,  far  more  immigrant  families  eligible  for \ncitizenship  will  forgo  their  right  to  seek  naturalization  solely  because  of  cost  under  the \nchallenged DHS rule.

Ass’n v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \nII.  The rule will impair economic mobility and community engagement for immigrants \neligible to naturalize. \nWhen  immigrants  eligible  to  naturalize  are  not  curtailed  in  their  ability  to  obtain \ncitizenship, they have the opportunity to create stronger ties with their community through the \nright to vote, the ability to serve on a jury, and a deeper sense of belonging. What may be less \nobvious  is  that  naturalization  also  provides  immigrants  with  significant  and  empirically \nobservable economic benefits. In particular, naturalized citizens see positive impacts in both \nincome and rate of employment, in the ability to own a home, and in their resilience to economic \ndownturns such as our current one. These benefits are at grave risk due to the challenged rule’s \nimposition of cost-prohibitive fees, and the inevitable decline in naturalization that would follow \nif the rule were implemented. \nHarm to income and employment. The challenged rule will suppress gains in income and \nemployment through naturalization. A recent study shows that naturalized citizens earn nearly \n9%, or roughly $3,200, more annually than if they remained non-citizens. Naturalized citizens \nalso see over a 2% increase in the employment rate after their access to employers broadens due \nto a change in status.7 These profound differences between naturalized citizens and non-citizens \nprevail even when other characteristics, like occupation, industry, language ability, country of \norigin, and duration of U.S. residence, are held constant.8 Incomes increase within just two years \n                                                 \n7 ENCHAUTEGUI & GIANNARELLI, supra note 3, at 2.  \n8 Id. at 8; MADELEINE SUMPTION & SARAH FLAMM, THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF CITIZENSHIP FOR \nIMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES 12 (2012), https://perma.cc/7CDN-LGN7.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 52   Filed 09/10/20   Page 9 of 17\nof obtaining citizenship, with accelerated earnings growth accruing in later years.9 A significant \nportion of those eligible to naturalize, however, may be less likely to access these employment \nopportunities if they cannot naturalize because of the high cost.  \nHarm to homeownership rates. The challenged rule will also hold down yet another \neconomic  benefit:  increased  rates  of  homeownership.  The  significant  increase  in  income \nresulting from naturalization is closely tied to greater  rates of homeownership. Naturalized \ncitizens are not only more likely to be able to afford down payments and mortgage payments, but \nthey also are empowered by a greater sense of belonging and permanency to make long term \nplans.  Thus,  naturalized  citizens  see  a  more  than  6%  rise  in  their  homeownership  rate  as \ncompared with similarly situated non-citizens who are eligible to naturalize.10 In cities, the jump \ncan be even more dramatic: in Boston, those who naturalize are 33% more likely to own homes \nthan comparable non-citizens, while in Seattle, rates for naturalized citizens are almost 20% \nhigher than for non-citizens.11 With decreased access to the naturalization process under the \nchallenged rule, the homeownership rate of immigrants would likewise suffer.  \nGreater risk from economic downturns. The challenged rule would also impair the gains \nthat the naturalization process yields for immigrants’ economic resiliency. Overall, the poverty \nrate  of  naturalized  citizens  is  7%  lower  than  that  of  lawful  permanent  residents.12  And \nnaturalized citizens are also better equipped to weather economic downturns than are non-\ncitizens. Between 2006 and 2010, for instance, non-citizen incomes fell by nearly four times the \n                                                 \n9 SUMPTION & FLAMM, supra note 8, at 12. \n10 ENCHAUTEGUI & GIANNARELLI, supra note 3, at 3, 17. \n11 Id. at 20. \n12 New York City Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, State of Our Immigrant City, 31 (2019), \nhttps://perma.cc/2ZUT-ERNK.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 52   Filed 09/10/20   Page 10 of 17\ndrop for naturalized citizens.13 The greater stability provided by naturalization is especially \nsignificant  now,  as  local  economies  recover  from  the  unprecedented  and  sudden  recession \nbrought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the unemployment rate hovering around 20% in \nNew York City and 16% in Chicago, increased resiliency would be a lifeline for many.14 \nAs noted above, the benefits of obtaining citizenship go beyond increasing individual \npurchasing power and economic stability—citizenship contributes substantially to immigrants’ \nability to integrate and engage with their communities. Participation in civic organizations and \nvolunteer  activities  dramatically  increase  as  income  and  homeownership  increase.15  This \ncountry’s historical recognition of these benefits is reflected in “Congress’ determination to \nmake it relatively easy for immigrants to become naturalized citizens.” Foley v. Connelie, 435 \nU.S. 291, 294 n.2 (1978). And only last year, when explaining its appropriations bill, Congress \nreaffirmed its commitment to these values in explicitly noting that fee waivers are expected to \ncontinue for those unable to pay the naturalization fee. H.R. Rep. 115-948, at 61 (2019). But \nDHS ignored that observation, and the wealth of data that reflects the abundant benefits of \ncitizenship,  and  instead  chose  a  path  destined  to  do  lasting  harm  to  immigrants  and  their \ncommunities.  \n                                                 \n13 SUMPTION & FLAMM, supra note 8, at 11.  \n14 New York State Department of Labor, NYS Economy Added 244,200 Private Sector Jobs in \nJuly 2020, https://perma.cc/P6H9-MEM8; Abdel Jimenez, Illinois unemployment rate hit 16.4% \nin April, a 44-year high, as coronavirus-related job losses multiplied, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, (May \n21, 2020),  https://tinyurl.com/yy7sp4tz.  \n15 Oren M.

By restricting access to citizenship, the final rule will not only impair municipalities’ \ncommunities, but also shrink their revenue streams in the midst of fiscal crisis.                                                                    \nRestricted access to naturalization will significantly affect not only individuals, but also \nthe  cities  they  call  home.  Cities  have  long  recognized  the  importance  of  access  to  the \nnaturalization  process,  and  many  have  invested  significant  resources  to  assist  low-income \nimmigrants  with  the  application  process.  Municipalities  have  a  particular  interest  in  the \neconomic mobility and personal growth of their foreign-born residents, not only because cities \nare  home  to  a  disproportionate  number  of  foreign-born  individuals,  or  because  fair  and \nreasonable access to naturalization strengthens our communities, but also because the individual \neconomic benefits of naturalization in the aggregate translate into significant increased revenue \nstreams through income taxes and a decrease in dependency on public benefits.16 For instance, if \na quarter of New York City residents eligible to naturalize did, in fact, do so, government bodies \nwould see an increase in revenue and decrease in public benefits payments exceeding $200 \nmillion. Those funds would be essential to state and municipal treasuries in any climate, but are \ncritical now as we face a once-in-a-generation fiscal crisis.  \nSince naturalized citizens fare better in the labor market—both as a result of higher \nemployment rates and higher income levels than non-citizens—they also contribute more in \nincome taxes.  Increased naturalization will, as a result,  generate more income-tax revenue. \nIllinois, for example, would have the opportunity to tax an additional nearly $130 million of \nearnings if just a quarter of Chicago’s eligible-to-naturalize population obtained citizenship.17 \nThe challenged rule will suppress access to those funds, curtailing naturalization by erecting a \n                                                 \n16 A study of 21 of some of the largest cities in the nation revealed that 29% of their populations \nwere foreign-born compared to just 13% of the nation’s population overall.

Governments at each level—but especially cities and states—will be \ndeprived of an important source of new revenue. For example, if only those New York City \nresidents who rely on fee waivers and fee reductions each year declined to naturalize, the City \nwould lose more than $3 million in annual city income tax alone going forward.18 The annual \nloss of income tax would be even greater at the state level—approaching $6 million.  \nAs naturalization rates fall, municipalities will also have to forgo the budgetary savings \nthey would otherwise realize from reduced dependency on public benefits. Because naturalized \ncitizens have higher incomes and higher employment rates, increased naturalization leads to a \ndecrease in government spending on public benefits.19 If just a quarter of New York City’s \nlawful permanent residents naturalized, the city would save close to $12 million on the city’s \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program alone. But if naturalization instead declines and the \ncity’s low-income immigrants no longer apply for naturalization—as is bound to occur under the \nnew fee scheme—dependency on these benefits will increase.  \nCities  have  long  recognized  the  significant  and  clearly  documented  benefits  of  its \nimmigrant residents’ obtaining citizenship and have invested resources to assist their low-income \nimmigrant populations with the naturalization process. Boston hosts an annual Citizenship Day \nduring which volunteers help with naturalization applications. Last year, this one-day effort \nalone resulted in 400 individuals filing such applications, with more than half qualifying for fee \nwaivers.20 New York City has funded programs like NYCitizenship and ActionNYC, which \n                                                 \n18 Id. at 24; New York City Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, Fact Sheet: Eligible to \nNaturalize New Yorkers, supra note 5, at 5. \n19 ENCHAUTEGUI & GIANNARELLI, supra note 3, at 24. \n20  City  of  Boston,  Comment  Letter  on  Proposed  Rule  to  Increase  U.S.  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services Fees (Dec. 30, 2019), available at https://perma.cc/XLT6-4ZAN. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03283-RDM   Document 52   Filed 09/10/20   Page 13 of 17\ncoordinate outreach activities and guide applicants throughout the naturalization process.

If this rule takes effect, millions across the country will \nlose access to an essential path to economic security and mobility—not due to any question \nabout their entitlement to citizenship, but simply because they cannot afford it. And the cities \nwhere they live will also be irreparably harmed in multiple ways, not least by losing the benefit \nof future revenue streams and fiscal savings stemming from immigrants’ economic rise—at a \ntime when municipal budgets are more strapped than ever.
