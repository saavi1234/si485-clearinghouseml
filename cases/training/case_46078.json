    "summary": "<p>On December 14, 2020, a group of agents and surety companies who post immigration bonds filed a complaint against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, the suit challenged a Final Rule which mandated exhaustion of administrative remedies by a Treasury-approved surety or its agent when challenging the breach of an immigration bond. In filing an administrative appeal, sureties and their agents were required to include all defenses to the government&rsquo;s bond breach declarations, but without the government being required to produce relevant documents and without sufficient time for the surety or agent to discuss the circumstances of the bond breach with the noncitizen. This, the complaint alleged, amounted to a violation of the due process clause. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Final Rule created an unequal application of the law as cash bond obligors are not required to exhaust their administrative remedies, thereby constituting an equal protection violation. The plaintiffs further claimed that the Rule was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;), both because it was arbitrary and capricious and because it was issued under Acting Secretary Wolf who was not validly appointed. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel, and the case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Kandis A. Westmore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss alleging the plaintiffs did not have Article III standing as no adverse action had been taken against them under the Final Rule they sought to challenge. The court granted the motion to dismiss on July 13, 2021. In doing so, the court found that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently allege an injury-in-fact that satisfied Article III&rsquo;s standing requirement. 2021 WL 5002220.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the court&rsquo;s order, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 3, 2021. The complaint realleged the same claims, but noted that since the Final Rule was promulgated the plaintiffs had filed over a thousand immigration bonds, and DHS had wrongfully declared breaches of a significant number of those bonds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, the defendants again filed a motion to dismiss for still lacking standing. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were still not ripe because they had suffered no injury under the Final Rule and because a ruling in their favor cannot redress their speculative future injury. On October 19, 2021, the court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs did sufficiently allege an injury and ripeness of their claims this time around. 2021 WL 5002221.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the filing of the administrative record, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on May 12, 2022. The plaintiffs did so on grounds that the rule was unlawfully promulgated, specifically because Acting Secretary Wolf lacked authority to issue it. After briefings on the matter, the government also notified the court of a Third Circuit opinion in the case Kajmowicz v. Whitaker (3rd Cir. 2022), which held that where a new and properly appointed agency official ratifies a Rule, the fact that an Acting official may have lacked the authority to initially issue it will not impact a rule&rsquo;s ultimate lawfulness. Plaintiffs then noted that subsequent ratification in this case cannot cure the issuance of a final rule promulgated by an unauthorized official.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 10, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. 2022 WL 4596611. The defendants then appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (22-16552) in October.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On appeal, the parties began with mediation conferences and filed briefs on the issue. Oral arguments were ultimately scheduled for October 19, 2023. The Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s final ruling then came down on July 18, 2024 wherein the court reversed the district court&rsquo;s decision. The court held that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (&ldquo;FVRA&rdquo;) did not bar Secretary Mayorkas from ratifying the Final Rule, and that ratification cured any defects in the Rule&rsquo;s initial promulgation, including Acting Secretary Wolf&rsquo;s issuance of the Rule. The court, thus, found that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. 107 F.4th 1064.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s mandate, the parties submitted a case management statement in January 2025 regarding next steps, noting that trial would not be expected. The plaintiffs noted that they were evaluating whether or not to file a Petition for Certiorari. The defendants noted that partial summary judgment ought to be granted in their favor considering the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In a February 2025 case management statement, the plaintiffs stated they would not be filing a Petition for Certiorari. The plaintiffs also noted that they intended to challenge the completeness of the administrative record previously submitted and to seek further discovery on this issue. On March 3, 2025, the court then set a case management conference for June 3, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the administrative record issues, and ordered the defendants to produce a privilege log. On March 6, the defendants filed a motion requesting leave to file a motion seeking reconsideration of the court&rsquo;s March 4 order to produce the privilege log.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case, thus, remains ongoing on remand.&nbsp;</p>",

This case challenges a final rule that (1) mandates administrative exhaustion for \n3  a Treasury-approved surety or its agent to challenge the government’s breach of an immigration \n4  bond without providing due process safeguards to allow for fair and impartial administrative \n5  review, (2) drastically increases the cost for administrative review, and (3) creates arbitrary \n6  criteria to determine whether a Treasury-approved surety can continue to post immigration \n7  bonds.  85 Fed. Reg. 45,968 (July 31, 2020) (“Final Rule”).   \n8  2.  The Final Rule requires that a Treasury-approved surety or its agent file an \n9  appeal of a bond breach claim by the government, and to include all defenses to the bond \n10  breach, without the government (1) producing documents supporting its breach determination, \n11  (2) producing documents to allow the surety and its agent to identify available defenses under \n12  the terms of the bond or mitigate damages claimed by DHS, and (3) allowing sufficient time for \n13  the surety or agent to discuss the circumstances of the bond breach with the alien or indemnitor.   \n14  3.  This violates the due process rights of the sureties and their agents because any \n15  defense not raised in the administrative appeal is prohibited from being raised in subsequent \n16  litigation in federal court.  Further, if the surety or its agent do not file an administrative appeal \n17  within 30 days of receiving of a breach notice, they are precluded from challenging the bond \n18  breach in federal court.   \n19  4.   With administrative exhaustion now required, the Final Rule increases the cost \n20  for a Treasury-approved surety to dispute the government’s breach of an immigration bond \n21  from $0 to $675, making it more expensive to challenge an immigration bond breach than it is \n22  to file a petition with the United States Supreme Court.  With the penal amount of certain \n23  immigration bonds set at $500, it now costs more to dispute the breach of certain bonds than it \n24  does to pay the bond.    \n25  5.  The Final Rule also creates such a low threshold for debarment of a surety that \n26  sureties will have no choice but to pay any breached immigration bond, even if the government \n27  is wrong in declaring the breach.   \n28  6.  By making these changes, the Final Rule effectively deprives sureties and their \n \n1 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 3 of 18\n \n1  agents from challenging the government’s breaches of immigration bonds. \n2  7.  The Final Rule also creates an unequal application of the law.  A cash bond \n3  obligor is not required to exhaust his or her administrative remedies.  Accordingly, their rights \n4  are reserved to challenge a bond breach in federal court based on any available defenses, \n5  regardless of whether the cash bond obligor filed an administrative appeal or not.  In addition, \n6  and as noted above, the government does not provide any documents related to the bond breach \n7  determination prior to the time an appeal must be filed, and all defenses must be raised with the \n8  appeal or they are prohibited from being raised in a subsequent federal civil suit.    The surety or \n9  its agent is therefore required to file an incomplete appeal, and is then precluded from raising \n10  any additional defenses in civil court if the appeal is denied and the breach determination \n11  upheld.      \n12  8.  DHS is also applying the Final Rule retroactively in violation of Supreme Court \n13  precedent prohibiting retroactivity in the enforcement of regulations unless clearly prescribed.   \n14  9.  The Final Rule is not authorized by statute, is contrary to law, and is arbitrary \n15  and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).    \n16  10.  The Final Rule is also unlawful because it was issued under Chad Wolf, who \n17  assumed the title of Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security without \n18  constitutional or statutory authority. \n19  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20  11.  Defendants’ promulgation of the Final Rule in the Federal Register on July 31, \n21  2020 constitutes final agency action and is therefore subject to judicial review.  5 U.S.C. §§ \n22  704, 706. \n23  12.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and 28 U.S.C. § \n24  1331. \n25  13.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 702 because \n26  they have been and will be injured by the Final Rule’s operation. \n27  14.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) \n28  because immigration bonds affected by the Final Rule are posted in this judicial district. \n \n2 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 4 of 18\n \n1  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n2  15.  The San Francisco or Oakland divisions are the proper divisions for the \n3  assignment of this case because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to \n4  the action occurred and occur in these divisions.   \n5  PARTIES \n6  16.   Plaintiff Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc. (“G&G”) is a \n7  California corporation that is primarily engaged in the business of posting immigration bonds \n8  on behalf of federally approved surety companies with DHS for, among other things, the release \n9  of aliens from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status.  \n10  17.  Plaintiff Topper Brokerage, Inc. (“Topper”) is a New York corporation that is \n11  primarily engaged in the business of posting immigration bonds on behalf of federally approved \n12  surety companies with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens from detention \n13  pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n14  18.  Plaintiff Allegheny Casualty Company (“Allegheny”) is a New Jersey \n15  corporation and a federally approved surety company engaged in, among other things, the \n16  business of posting immigration bonds with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens \n17  from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n18  19.  Plaintiff Lexington National Insurance Corporation (“Lexington”) is a Florida \n19  corporation and a federally approved surety company engaged in, among other things, the \n20  business of posting immigration bonds with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens \n21  from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n22  20.  Plaintiff American Surety Company (“American Surety”) is an Indiana \n23  corporation and a federally approved surety company engaged in, among other things, the \n24  business of posting immigration bonds with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens \n25  from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n26  21.  G&G, Topper, Allegheny, Lexington, and American Surety are collectively \n27  referred to as “Plaintiffs.” \n28  22.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet-level  \n \n3 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 5 of 18\n \n1  department of the United States federal government.  DHS issued the Final Rule. \n2  23.  Defendant Chad Wolf has held the title of Acting Secretary of Homeland \n3  Security since November 13, 2019.  He is sued in that capacity, and the Final Rule was issued \n4  under his purported authority.  \n5  24.  Defendant Kenneth Cuccinelli currently holds the role of Senior Official \n6  Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. \n7  25.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is a sub-agency of DHS \n8  and is responsible for the administration of immigration bonds.   \n9  THE FINAL RULE IS UNLAWFUL \n10  A.  The Administrative Review Process Is Fatally Flawed  \n11  26.  The Final Rule requires administrative exhaustion through $675 appeals of \n12  immigration bond breaches to the Administrative Appeals Office (“AAO”).  If a bond breach is \n13  not formally appealed to the AAO, the bond obligor and surety forfeit any challenge to the bond \n14  breach determination in federal court.   \n15  27.  The AAO is not equipped to handle immigration bond breach appeals.   \n16  28.  There is no appeal process other than the submission of an initial appeal through \n17  submission of a government form.  While the surety or its agent may include arguments in \n18  support of their defenses with the appeal form, there is no briefing on the issues.  Nor is there \n19  any exchange of documents, and DHS does not provide any documents to the surety or its \n20  agent related to the breach determination.  There is no hearing.  A DHS officer simply makes a \n21  decision based on review of the appeal form. \n22  29.  In addition, the AAO rarely issues precedential decisions, and none have \n23  addressed immigration bond breaches.  Further, the AAO has not issued any precedential \n24  decisions adopting the legal findings of the court in United States of America v. Gonzales & \n25  Gonzales Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc., et al. (Case No. C 09-4029 EMC).  Those \n26  findings address the propriety of immigration bond breaches by DHS.   \n27  30.  The AAO’s standard of review is not codified in any statute or regulation.    \n28  31.  The AAO does not state how it determines which cases become precedent  \n \n4 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 6 of 18\n \n1  decisions.  Nor does the AAO interact with local service centers and district offices to ensure \n2  that like cases are adjudicated in like manner. \n3  32.  The AAO has not published its appellate rules and statistics on decision making \n4  standards and data.   \n5  33.  The vast majority of all immigration bond breach appeals to the AAO are \n6  denied.   \n7  34.  Resorting to the AAO is futile, expensive, time-consuming, and without any due \n8  process safeguards.  The substantial expenses, coupled with the futility of an AAO appeal, has \n9  resulted in many sureties choosing an informal written dispute methodology for challenging \n10  bond breaches, rather than pursuing relief through the AAO.  \n11  B.  Whether Through the AAO or a Written Dispute, DHS Refuses to Produce \n12  A-files for Bonds Where it Has Declared an Obligor or Surety to Be in \n13  Breach  \n14  35.  The A-file contains many documents that are relevant to disputed bond breach \n15  claims.  These documents assist the surety in (1) identifying available defenses under the terms \n16  of the bond, (2) locating and producing the alien to DHS, and (3) mitigating damages claimed \n17  by DHS.   \n18  36.  DHS produces little, if any, documents when declaring an immigration bond \n19  breach.  DHS thereby prevents the sureties from being able to properly challenge DHS’s bond \n20  breach declarations.  The Final Rule authorizes DHS to continue this pattern of non-production \n21  while also demanding payment.    \n22  37.  This violates a decision in U.S. v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Ins. Agency, \n23  Inc. (N.D. Cal., Sept. 25, 2012, No. C-09-4029 EMC).  There, the court ordered DHS to apply \n24  certain standards for review of disputes over its bond breach determinations.  DHS was ordered \n25  to produce the entirety of the A-files, and to “consider each defense for each bond and provide a \n26  decision for each bond breach determination, with an explanation of its reasons for accepting or \n27  rejecting each defense as to each bond found to be breached.  Such reasoned decisions will \n28  permit this Court to correctly apply an arbitrary and capricious standard of review in keeping  \n \n5 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 7 of 18\n \n1  with 8 C.F.R. § 103.6(e).”   \n2  38.  DHS was further ordered to “evaluate these positions in a fair and neutral \n3  manner, upon the entirety of the administrative record before it. DHS shall then issue a reasoned \n4  decision and certify the administrative record, stating which parts of the record it believes \n5  deserves weight, and the reasons why.”  U.S. v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Ins. Agency, \n6  Inc. (N.D. Cal., Sept. 25, 2012, No. C-09-4029 EMC) 2012 WL 4462915, at 9.   \n7  39.  None of these requirements are mentioned in the Final Rule.    \n8  40.  The requirement that an immigration bond agent or surety pursue a $675  \n9  administrative appeal of an immigration bond breach declaration made by DHS fails to follow \n10  DHS’s own procedure for reviewing disputes over its bond breach determinations.  Reference in \n11  the Final Rule is made to both an appeal to the AAO or, alternatively, the submission of a \n12  written dispute to DHS.  It remains unclear whether DHS is requiring an appeal to the AAO in \n13  order to seek judicial review, or whether a surety may also challenge a bond breach \n14  determination by written dispute.  With the written dispute process still authorized in the Final \n15  Rule, it is inconsistent to require AAO exhaustion when this written dispute remedy exists to \n16  challenge a bond breach determination.  \n17  41.  Further, for at least the past eight years, DHS has used a procedure whereby a \n18  bond agent or surety may submit a written dispute to DHS for review and a determination \n19  whether to uphold the breach or cancel the bond.  While this process continues to have its flaws, \n20  it provides a better alternative to the AAO for review of disputed bond breach determinations.   \n21  42.  It remains unclear how AAO review would function within this established \n22  written dispute process.  The Final Rule requires an AAO appeal within 30 days of a breach \n23  determination, but a surety is already permitted 30 days to submit a written dispute.  If it \n24  chooses to submit a written dispute, it will effectively be time-barred from submitting an appeal \n25  to the AAO.    \n26  43.  The 30-day deadline for appealing to the AAO also fails to allow enough time \n27  for a surety to discuss the circumstances of a bond breach with the alien or indemnitor.   DHS \n28  only sends a notice of a bond breach.  DHS does not send any documents supporting the breach \n \n6 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 8 of 18\n \n1  determination.  It takes at least an additional 60 days for a surety or its agent to receive a \n2  “Record of Proceedings” from DHS.  The Record of Proceedings is what DHS claims are the \n3  documents relevant to support its breach determination.  By the time the surety or its agent \n4  receives these documents, they were already required to file an appeal of the breach  \n5  determination and raise all their defenses.  \n6  44.  In addition, the Record of Proceedings is insufficient and does not include all \n7  documents necessary for a surety or its agent to prepare and file their appeal.  It only includes a \n8  limited number of documents selected by DHS that only purport to support DHS’s bond breach \n9  claim.   \n10  45.   Sureties or their agents are not provided the A-File, which is required by court \n11  decisions addressing immigration bond breach appeals.  And documents requested through a \n12  Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request and that are related to the bond breach \n13  determination take even longer to be produced.  Yet, the Final Rule requires the surety or its \n14  agent to have already appealed the breach decision and raised all arguments in support of its \n15  position within 30 days of receipt of the breach notice.  This time constraint makes it  \n16  impossible to prepare a proper and timely appeal.    \n17  46.  In contrast, those who post cash immigration bonds are not required to exhaust \n18  administrative remedies through an appeal to the AAO.  If an individual posts a cash bond, he \n19  or she may challenge DHS’s breach determination in federal court without the requirement of \n20  filing an AAO appeal.    \n21  47.  DHS is also applying the Final Rule retroactively in violation of U.S. Supreme \n22  Court precedent.  In Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., supra, 488 U.S. 204, 208, the Court \n23  held that “[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law ... [and] congressional enactments and \n24  administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language \n25  requires this result.”  A law or regulation operates retroactively if it “impair[s] rights a party \n26  possessed when he acted, increase[s] a party's liability for past conduct, or impose[s] new duties \n27  with respect to transactions already completed.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, \n28  280 (1994). \n \n7 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 9 of 18\n \n1  48.  DHS is applying the requirement of an AAO appeal to bonds posted prior to \n2  adoption of the Final Rule.  The sureties and their agents entered into contracts with aliens and \n3  indemnitors based on the mutual understanding and agreement between all the parties, \n4  including DHS, that there was no requirement of administrative exhaustion to challenge a bond \n5  breach.  DHS has now altered this understanding and effectively changed the terms of the \n6  posted bonds to implement this requirement.  As such, the Final Rule is unlawful as it is being \n7  applied retroactively.   \n8  C.  No Statute Authorizes DHS to Decertify Sureties \n9  49.  Congress has not delegated to the DHS the authority to establish its own \n10  standards for the declination of a surety’s bonds. \n11  50.  The Final Rule conflicts with 31 U.S.C. §§ 9304-9308 and impermissibly alters \n12  these code sections without Congressional approval or authority.  It allows DHS to usurp the \n13  authority of the Treasury as the sole Government agency authorized by Congress to approve and \n14  revoke the authority of a surety to provide surety bonds.   \n15  51.  The Final Rule allows DHS to decline to accept any and all bonds underwritten \n16  by a Treasury-certified surety whenever DHS claims (1) ten or more invoices issued to the \n17  surety on “administratively final breach determinations” are “past due”, or (2) the surety “owes” \n18  a cumulative total of $50,000 or more on “past due” invoices issued to the surety on \n19  “administratively final breach determinations,”1 or (3) the surety has a “breach” rate of 35 \n20  percent or greater based on a comparison of “administratively final breach determinations” and \n21  bond cancellations.   \n22  52.  No code section authorizes such arbitrary power.  The only code section that \n23  addresses the ability of a surety to do business is 31 U.S.C. 9305, and that section clearly and \n24  unambiguously provides that only Treasury may revoke the authority of a surety corporation to \n25  do new business, and it may do so only if (1) the Secretary decides the corporation is insolvent, \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n1 With the increasingly high penal sum of bonds being written, this cumulative \n28 \nmaximum could very well involve one disputed bond breach determination.  \n \n8 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 10 of 18\n \n1  or (2) is in violation of sections 9304, 9305 or 9306.  None of these three sections authorize \n2  revocation if there is an outstanding unpaid bond obligation.  Nor are these regulatory \n3  “changes,” as claimed by DHS.  Rather, they are entirely new regulations.  And there is no \n4  reference in these regulations to any recently passed legislation authorizing them.   \n5  53.  These regulations effectively grant DHS the authority to revoke a surety’s \n6  certification by bypassing the one and only statutory scheme governing revocation of a surety’s \n7  certification.     \n8  D.  Only Treasury Has Limited Authority to Prevent a Surety from Conducting \n9  Business  \n10  54.  By providing agencies such as DHS with the authority to refuse bonds from \n11  certain sureties, the Final Rule conflicts with 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308, which specifically authorize \n12  Treasury to certify and decertify sureties posting federal bonds.  The “background” section of \n13  the Final Rule confirms that Treasury is responsible for administering the corporate Federal \n14  surety bond program under the authority of 31 U.S.C. §§ 9304-9308.  Treasury does not have \n15  the right to delegate, by regulation or otherwise, its exclusive authority to administer federal \n16  surety bonds. \n17  55.  31 U.S.C. 9305 clearly and unambiguously provides that Treasury may revoke \n18  the authority of a surety corporation to do new business only if (1) the Secretary decides the \n19  corporation is insolvent, or (2) is in violation of sections 9304, 9305 or 9306.  None of these \n20  three sections authorize DHS to reject a bond issued by a surety who has an outstanding unpaid \n21  bond obligation that DHS contends is due and owing.  \n22  56.  31 U.S.C. 9305(e) precludes the writing of an additional bond only if the surety \n23  has not paid a final judgment that has not been appealed.  The Final Rules allows DHS to \n24  replace this “final judgment” provision of 31 U.S.C. 9305(e) with DHS’s claim that there are \n25  “past due” invoices on “administratively final breach determinations.”  A final judgment is no \n26  longer required even though Congress specified this requirement.  DHS’s utilization of a \n27  standard that is far more stringent than the standard Congress has provided to Treasury violates \n28  due process and runs afoul of specific Congressional intent on the subject. \n \n9 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 11 of 18\n \n1  57.  There is no authority for these changes to the code section.  The regulations \n2  impermissibly alter statutory mandates and create new law by allowing DHS to administer the \n3  Federal surety bond program.  The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected such regulations.  In Bowen \n4  v. Georgetown University Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988), the Court held that it is axiomatic \n5  that an administrative agency’s power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the \n6  authority delegated by Congress. \n7  58.  In Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 297 \n8  U.S. 129, 134-135 (1936), emphasis added, the Court held that: \n9  “[t]he power of an administrative officer or board to administer a federal \n10  statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is not the power \n11  to make law, for no such power can be delegated by Congress, but the \n12  power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as \n13  expressed by the statute.  A regulation which does not do this, but \n14  operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity \n15  . . . And not only must a regulation, in order to be valid, be consistent \n16  with the statute, but it must be reasonable.”  \n17  59.  Further, where a Treasury statute is unambiguous, and its directions specific, \n18  there is no power to amend it by regulation.  Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U.S. 441, 446-447, 56 \n19  S.Ct. 767, 769 - 770 (1936).  See also Goodson-Todman Enterprises, Ltd. v. Commissioner, 784 \n20  F.2d 66, 74 (2d Cir.1986) (“A Treasury regulation may therefore be declared invalid . . . if it is \n21  unreasonable or clearly contrary to the language or spirit of the statute it purports to \n22  implement”).   \n23  60.  Congress delegated to Treasury (rather than DHS) the sole authority to decertify \n24  sureties because Treasury has expertise in financial matters and the financial surveillance of \n25  sureties authorized to write federal bonds.  DHS does not have the expertise to conduct due \n26  process hearings regarding the value of a security, and more importantly, DHS has a conflict of \n27  interest in conducting such proceedings because its goal in refusing to accept immigration \n28  bonds is to force the surety to pay invoiced bonds, even though the underlying breaches may be \n \n10 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 12 of 18\n \n1  disputed.  This creates an incentive for DHS, whose AAO unit is ostensibly reviewing bond \n2  breaches impartially, to uphold its breaches.   \n3  61.  The current federal statutes provide a vehicle to address a recalcitrant surety.  \n4  Treasury has hearings providing substantial rights to the surety to contest the allegations of a  \n5  disgruntled agency. \n6  E.  The Regulations Alter the Existing Standard of Review in Decertification \n7  Proceedings  \n8  62.  The regulations allow DHS to refuse all immigration bonds by a surety if DHS \n9  determines that “administratively final breach determinations” are “past due.”  This is no \n10  different than decertification.  Such a harsh, drastic decision is limited, and only permitted \n11  under 31 U.S.C. 9305(e)(1), which precludes the writing of an additional bond only if the surety \n12  has not paid a final judgment that has not been appealed.    \n13  63.  The Final Rule would result in unprecedented deference to DHS to make the law, \n14  to produce only those records it deems necessary to produce (even if the records in DHS’s \n15  possession would refute DHS’s claim on the bond), and to adopt without challenge only those \n16  interpretations most advantageous to the agency.   \n17  64.  DHS’s interpretation of the law is not the law.  The law and the interpretation of \n18  statutes are decided by the courts, not by a governmental agency attempting to collect debt to \n19  pay for its programs.  Many of the issues that the sureties rely upon in refusing payment have \n20  been adjudicated against DHS.  To allow DHS to refuse bonds, i.e. decertify a company, based \n21  on erroneous interpretations of law that are subject to judicial challenge is a deprivation of due \n22  process.  \n23  F.  The For Cause Standards are Flawed and Anticompetitive  \n24  65.  DHS identifies three metrics that it will use to determine whether it will continue \n25  to accept immigration bonds from a surety.  If the surety does not meet any one of these \n26  “standards”, DHS can decline all future immigration bonds from that surety.  These “for cause” \n27  measurements are arbitrary, fail to reflect a surety’s performance in paying legally valid bond  \n28  breach determinations, and penalize sureties and their agents in favor of cash bond obligors. \n \n11 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 13 of 18\n \n1  66.  First, DHS treats a single, $50,000 immigration bond invoice the same as ten \n2  invoices which may total far less than $50,000.  Treating a single bond breach as equivalent to \n3  ten bond breaches is arbitrary and makes little sense.  There must be consistency in any standard \n4  used by the government to determine whether it will prevent a surety from conducting business.             \n5  67.  Another “for cause” standard uses a breach rate calculation.  DHS proposes to \n6  take the number of bond breaches from October 1 to September 30 of the preceding year and \n7  divide that by the number of bond breaches and number of cancelled bonds during that same \n8  year.  This is flawed and unfair for several reasons.  DHS makes clear in its preamble to the \n9  Final Rule that it has had a problem with the failure to pay breaches by sureties and their agents.  \n10  This is the sole purpose identified by DHS for the Final Rule.  By trying to monitor \n11  performance of a surety, the 35% breach rate calculation as a “for cause” reason to refuse \n12  certain bonds is not in furtherance of DHS’s stated purpose in enacting the Final Rule.   \n13  68.  It is also arbitrary to set a snapshot time frame to make a breach rate calculation.  \n14  A surety may have several cancellations a few days or weeks before the start of a fiscal year or \n15  shortly after the fiscal year concludes.  A surety could be slightly over the 35% threshold during \n16  one fiscal year, and under it the previous and subsequent fiscal years.  Being above or below the \n17  35% number could thus become a function of luck more than anything else.  Further, by \n18  creating calculation periods, a surety or agent would be incentivized to seek cancellations or \n19  challenge breaches, and time them so that a breach or cancellation would fall prior to or after a \n20  fiscal year begins.    \n21  69.  Moreover, DHS’s failure to include all outstanding bonds issued by the surety in \n22  determining a breach rate calculation is unfair.  A surety can have 5 breaches and 8 \n23  cancellations during a fiscal year, for a 38% “breach rate.”  But it may have an additional 87 \n24  bonds outstanding during that fiscal year.  The number of breaches in comparison to the number \n25  of outstanding bonds plus cancelled bonds would be 5%.  Rather than use this number to \n26  calculate a breach rate, DHS ignores bonds that have not been breached or cancelled.  Those \n27  bonds can most certainly end up being cancelled as the years proceed, thereby substantially \n28  lowering the breach rate that was calculated as of a certain date based on a very small statistical \n \n12 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 14 of 18\n \n1  sampling.  But that would count for nothing during that particular breach rate calculation.  DHS \n2  instead will extrapolate a breach rate by arguing that the breach rate will remain consistent as \n3  the outstanding bonds are either breached or cancelled over a very long period of time.  There is \n4  no basis for such a methodology, no statistical analysis for calculating a breach rate in this \n5  fashion, and DHS offers no explanation in support of its arbitrary standard. In short, DHS relies \n6  on speculation of future breaches and cancellations to justify its refusal to allow the posting of  \n7  bonds from a surety.  This is another example of a due process violation.  Under DHS’s \n8  standard, there would be nothing to challenge before DHS simply refused to accept any further \n9  immigration bonds from a Treasury approved surety company. DHS seeks to deny the ability of \n10  a surety or agent to post a bond by using an untested and unapproved extrapolation model.              \n11  70.  The “for cause” standards are also anticompetitive.  They create unfair \n12  measurements for surety bonds, while failing to impose the same standards for cash bonds.  The \n13  government contends that it can simply take the cash posted for a cash bond and therefore does \n14  not need to set any requirements for cash bond obligors.  But this is a tacit acknowledgement \n15  that DHS has no problem with bond breaches, as long as they are paid.  Yet, DHS’s breach rate \n16  calculation punishes surety bond obligors by counting paid bond breaches against them.  \n17  Payment by cash bond obligors has absolved them of any repercussions as they are not subject \n18  to the Final Rule.  On the other hand, payment by surety bond obligors does not absolve them \n19  from being punished as paid bond breaches will count against them.  This favors cash bond \n20  obligors and, in turn, manipulates the immigration bond market by punishing all surety bond \n21  companies and their agents, regardless of whether they pay breaches or not.  \n22  71.  As with other attempts to manipulate a market arbitrarily and without sufficient \n23  research, there will be unintended consequences.  It will become more difficult for those \n24  seeking release from DHS detention pending review of their immigration status to be released.  \n25  Surety bonds will become less available and fewer individuals will be released as cash bonds \n26  will not be affordable to many.  Detention will increase, costing the government even more \n27  money to fund and administer newly needed detention space.     \n28  72.  The Final Rule is irrational, arbitrary, contrary to law, and an unjustified reversal  \n \n13 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 15 of 18\n \n1  of past practice.  It must be set aside under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D) (rules \n2  issued “without observance of procedure required by law,” “not in accordance with law,” or “in \n3  excess of statutory authority” must be set aside). \n4  G.  DHS’s Review Has Proven Futile  \n5  73.  The Final Rule authorizes DHS to administer the Federal surety bond program \n6  even though DHS has been found in court decisions to not abide by its agreements and \n7  established law regarding immigration bonds and breach determinations.  DHS’s \n8  “administratively final” determinations that an immigration bond has been breached have been \n9  made in error, as determined by the federal court in United States of America v. Gonzales & \n10  Gonzales Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc., et al. (Case No. C 09-4029 EMC).   \n11  74.  In United States of America v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Insurance \n12  Agency, Inc., et al. (Case No. C 09-4029 EMC), the court ruled that the obligations set forth in \n13  statutes, regulations, case law, and the terms specified in the immigration bonds themselves \n14  must all be considered when the agency declares a bond breach.  The court also held that a \n15  surety is entitled to review of the entire A-file, with the exception of privileged documents, to \n16  determine if DHS’s administratively final breach declaration is proper.  This exacting judicial \n17  review is a far cry from the Final Rule, which simply allow DHS to reject sureties and seek their \n18  decertification by claiming that it has declared an immigration bond breach to be \n19  administratively final.  \n20  75.  In Gonzales & Gonzales, the surety initially asserted 17 bonds in a counterclaim \n21  where it claimed that DHS’s administratively final breach determination was in error.  DHS \n22  then sought to remand 11 of the 17 bonds where it too felt its initial breach determination was in \n23  error.  That amounts to an admitted 65% error rate by DHS.  If the Final Rule had been in effect \n24  at that time, DHS could have simply declared that 11 bonds were due and owing from the \n25  surety, and it would therefore no longer allow immigration bonds to be posted by that surety.   \n26  76.  As the case proceeded, the court ruled that DHS abused its discretion in making \n27  bond breach determinations in a majority of bonds presented for summary judgment by the \n28  parties.  The rulings were then applied to all the disputed immigration bond breach \n \n14 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 16 of 18\n \n1  determinations made by DHS on bonds posted by the surety. The result was that hundreds of \n2  bonds DHS declared as breached and “past due” were erroneously declared breached and were \n3  not, therefore, past due.   \n4  77.  The Final Rule eviscerates this necessary judicial review and allows DHS to \n5  threaten to cut off their business unless sureties pay up, regardless of whether DHS is wrong on \n6  the law.   \n7  COUNT I \n8  (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n9  78.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n10  79.  Under the APA, a court must set “aside agency action” that is “not in accordance \n11  with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n12  80.  The APA states that a court must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \n13  that is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \n14  law; … (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \n15  right;… (D) without observance of procedure required by law …” or “(E) unsupported by \n16  substantial evidence.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Courts will invalidate agency determinations that fail \n17  to “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \n18  ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”’ Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n \n19  v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (citation omitted). \n20  81.  Furthermore, when an agency substantially alters a position, it must “supply a \n21  reasoned analysis for the change,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42, and may not “depart from a prior \n22  policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.” FCC v. Fox TV \n23  Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (citing United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 696 \n24  (1974)). \n25  82.  The Final Rule is unlawful under the APA for several independent reasons \n26  mentioned above, each of which is sufficient to require that the Final Rule be set aside. \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n15 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 17 of 18\n \n1  COUNT II \n2  (Violation of the Fifth Amendment – Equal Protection, U.S. Const. amend.

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits Defendants from \n5  denying any person the equal protection of the laws.  \n6  85.  The Final Rule favors cash bond obligors over Treasury-approved sureties who \n7  post immigration bonds.  It creates a dual legal system whereby cash bond obligors need not \n8  exhaust administrative remedies while reserving their rights to challenge a bond breach in \n9  federal court.  On the other hand, in order to reserve their rights to challenge a bond breach in \n10  federal court, sureties must quickly appeal a bond breach and pursue administrative relief \n11  without being provided necessary due process safeguards  \n12  86.  On this basis, DHS has violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \n13  Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n14  COUNT III \n15  (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n16  87.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n17  88.   Under the APA, a court must set “aside agency action” that is “not in \n18  accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n19  89.  The issuance of the Final Rule was an agency action. \n20  90.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is a principal officer of the United States \n21  whose appointment requires presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. 6 U.S.C. § \n22  112(a)(1). \n23  91.  Defendant Wolf issued the Final Rule purportedly in the performance of the \n24  function or duty of Acting Secretary.  Defendant Wolf was not validly appointed and lacked \n25  authority to issue the Final Rule. \n26  92.  The Final Rule should be set aside under the APA for contravening the APA. \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n16 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW     Document 1     Filed 12/14/20     Page 18 of 18\n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n3  1.

This case challenges a final rule that was unlawfully promulgated by a DHS \n3  official that several courts have now held was not lawfully serving in his role.  It was issued \n4  under Chad Wolf, who assumed the title of Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland \n5  Security without constitutional or statutory authority. \n6  2.  The final rule (1) mandates administrative exhaustion for a Treasury-approved \n7  surety or its agent to challenge the government’s breach of an immigration bond without \n8  providing due process safeguards to allow for fair and impartial administrative review, (2) \n9  drastically increases the cost for administrative review, and (3) creates arbitrary criteria to \n10  determine whether a Treasury-approved surety can continue to post immigration bonds.  85 Fed. \n11  Reg. 45,968 (July 31, 2020) (“Final Rule”).   \n12  3.  The Final Rule requires that a Treasury-approved surety or its agent file an \n13  appeal of a bond breach claim by the government, and to include all defenses to the bond \n14  breach, without the government (1) producing documents supporting its breach determination, \n15  (2) producing documents to allow the surety and its agent to identify available defenses under \n16  the terms of the bond or mitigate damages claimed by DHS, and (3) allowing sufficient time for \n17  the surety or agent to discuss the circumstances of the bond breach with the alien or indemnitor.   \n18  4.  This violates the due process rights of the sureties and their agents because any \n19  defense not raised in the administrative appeal is prohibited from being raised in subsequent \n20  litigation in federal court.  Further, if the surety or its agent do not file an administrative appeal \n21  within 30 days of receiving of a breach notice, they are precluded from challenging the bond \n22  breach in federal court.   \n23  5.   With administrative exhaustion now required, the Final Rule increases the cost \n24  for a Treasury-approved surety to dispute the government’s breach of an immigration bond \n25  from $0 to $675, making it more expensive to challenge an immigration bond breach than it is \n26  to file a petition with the United States Supreme Court.  With the penal amount of certain \n27  immigration bonds set at $500, it now costs more to dispute the breach of certain bonds than it \n28  does to pay the bond.    \n \n1 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 3 of 22\n \n1  6.  The Final Rule also creates such a low threshold for debarment of a surety that \n2  sureties will have no choice but to pay any breached immigration bond, even if the government \n3  is wrong in declaring the breach.   \n4  7.  By making these changes, the Final Rule effectively deprives sureties and their \n5  agents from challenging the government’s breaches of immigration bonds. \n6  8.  The Final Rule also creates an unequal application of the law.  A cash bond \n7  obligor is not required to exhaust his or her administrative remedies.  Accordingly, their rights \n8  are reserved to challenge a bond breach in federal court based on any available defenses, \n9  regardless of whether the cash bond obligor filed an administrative appeal or not.  In addition, \n10  and as noted above, the government does not provide any documents related to the bond breach \n11  determination prior to the time an appeal must be filed, and all defenses must be raised with the \n12  appeal or they are prohibited from being raised in a subsequent federal civil suit.    The surety or \n13  its agent is therefore required to file an incomplete appeal, and is then precluded from raising \n14  any additional defenses in civil court if the appeal is denied and the breach determination \n15  upheld.      \n16  9.  DHS is also applying the Final Rule retroactively in violation of Supreme Court \n17  precedent prohibiting retroactivity in the enforcement of regulations unless clearly prescribed.   \n18  10.  The Final Rule is not authorized by statute, is contrary to law, and is arbitrary \n19  and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).    \n20  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21  11.  Defendants’ promulgation of the Final Rule in the Federal Register on July 31, \n22  2020 constitutes final agency action and is therefore subject to judicial review.  5 U.S.C. §§ \n23  704, 706. \n24  12.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and 28 U.S.C. § \n25  1331. \n26  13.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 702 because \n27  they have been and will be injured by the Final Rule’s operation. \n28  14.  Since the July 31, 2020 issuance of the Final Rule, plaintiffs have posted over a  \n \n2 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 4 of 22\n \n1  thousand immigration bonds.  Since that date, DHS has declared breaches of over 70 \n2  immigration bonds posted by plaintiffs.  DHS wrongfully declared breaches of a significant \n3  number of these immigration bonds.  The plaintiff posting the bond had a valid ground for \n4  challenging DHS’s breach declaration, but did not do so because of the expense, futility, the \n5  severely compacted time period required to file an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Office \n6  (“AAO”), and due process concerns relating to an appeal.   \n7  15.  As discussed in more detail below, the AAO does not provide the surety with \n8  due process, and almost universally upholds a DHS breach determination regardless of the \n9  merits of the defense to the breach declaration.  Given this, it makes no sense to spend $675 for \n10  the AAO to rubber stamp DHS’s breach declaration.  As a result, plaintiffs are currently \n11  suffering harm by being placed in the untenable position of losing any meaningful opportunity \n12  to challenge a breach declaration.  If forced to the AAO process, the plaintiffs are saddled with \n13  an outrageous filing fee, and forced to file an appeal before they have received DHS’s file on \n14  the particular breach to either substantiate the surety’s defenses to the bond breach, or to \n15  establish new and additional defenses.  If the plaintiffs do not file an administrative appeal to \n16  the AAO, then the Final Rule provides that the surety has failed to exhaust its administrative \n17  remedies and is therefore precluded form challenging the breach determination in Federal \n18  District Court.     \n19  16.  The plaintiffs are also currently being harmed because DHS’s breach \n20  declarations are now counting against plaintiffs’ “performance statistics” regardless of the \n21  merits of the defenses to the breaches.  Given the expense and futility of appealing a breach to \n22  the AAO, plaintiffs have been forced to pay DHS in response to DHS’s breach declarations, \n23  even if the breaches are improper or lacking in merit.  Further, since July 31, 2020, plaintiffs \n24  have timely paid a substantial number of bonds declared breached by DHS.  However, under the \n25  Final Rule, the timely payments of these bonds to DHS make no difference to the criteria DHS \n26  now uses under the Final Rule to determine whether to debar a surety from posting immigration \n27  bonds.  Plaintiffs have been effectively forced to pay improperly declared bond breaches, but \n28  even the timely payment of those bonds does nothing to change the breach rates that the Final  \n \n3 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 5 of 22\n \n1  Rule now mandates DHS use to support a debarment.     \n2  17.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) \n3  because a significant number of immigration bonds affected by the Final Rule are posted in this \n4  judicial district, are currently in open status, and are subject to a potential declaration of breach \n5  by DHS’s officers in this judicial district. \n6  18.  In addition, DHS previously filed suit against Plaintiffs Gonzales & Gonzales \n7  Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc. and American Surety Company in this judicial district.  In \n8  Case No. 3:09-cv-04029-EMC, DHS stated in its complaint that “[v]enue is proper in the \n9  Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) because G&G/ASC \n10  conducts business in California and failed to perform the conditions of the immigration bonds in \n11  San Francisco, California.”  (United States of America v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and. \n12  Insurance Agency, Inc., and American Surety Company, Inc., Case No. 3:09-cv-04029-EMC, \n13  Complaint, Document 1, Filed 08/28/09). \n14  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n15  19.  The San Francisco or Oakland divisions are the proper divisions for the  \n16  assignment of this case because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to \n17  the action occurred and occur in these divisions.   \n18  PARTIES \n19  20.   Plaintiff Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc. (“G&G”) is a \n20  California corporation that is primarily engaged in the business of posting immigration bonds \n21  on behalf of federally approved surety companies with DHS for, among other things, the release \n22  of aliens from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status.  \n23  21.  Plaintiff Topper Brokerage, Inc. (“Topper”) is a New York corporation that is \n24  primarily engaged in the business of posting immigration bonds on behalf of federally approved \n25  surety companies with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens from detention \n26  pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n27  22.  Plaintiff Allegheny Casualty Company (“Allegheny”) is a New Jersey \n28  corporation and a federally approved surety company engaged in, among other things, the  \n \n4 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 6 of 22\n \n1  business of posting immigration bonds with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens  \n2  from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n3  23.  Plaintiff Lexington National Insurance Corporation (“Lexington”) is a Florida \n4  corporation and a federally approved surety company engaged in, among other things, the \n5  business of posting immigration bonds with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens \n6  from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n7  24.  Plaintiff American Surety Company (“American Surety”) is an Indiana \n8  corporation and a federally approved surety company engaged in, among other things, the \n9  business of posting immigration bonds with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens \n10  from detention pending a determination of the alien’s immigration status. \n11  25.  G&G, Topper, Allegheny, Lexington, and American Surety are collectively \n12  referred to as “plaintiffs.” \n13  26.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet-level  \n14  department of the United States federal government.  DHS issued the Final Rule. \n15  27.  Defendant Chad Wolf held the title of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \n16  from November 13, 2019 to January 11, 2021.  He is sued in that capacity, and the Final Rule \n17  was issued under his purported authority.  \n18  28.  Defendant Kenneth Cuccinelli held the role of Senior Official Performing the \n19  Duties of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security from November 13, 2019 to January 20, \n20  2021.  He is sued in that capacity, and the Final Rule was issued during this period.  \n21  29.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is a sub-agency of DHS \n22  and is responsible for the administration of immigration bonds.   \n23  THE FINAL RULE IS UNLAWFUL \n24  A.  The Final Rule Was Promulgated Unlawfully    \n25  30.  Defendant Chad Wolf was not validly appointed and lacked authority to issue the \n26  Final Rule.   \n27  31.  On June 22, 2021, the Court in Behring Regional Center LLC v. Wolf, 2021 WL \n28  2554051 (N.D. Cal., June 22, 2021, No. 20-CV-09263-JSC) granted summary judgment against \n \n5 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 7 of 22\n \n1  DHS for its improper and unlawful promulgation of a Final Rule by a DHS official who was not \n2  lawfully serving as an official when he promulgated the Final Rule.   \n3  32.  The Behring decision addressed Former Acting Homeland Security Secretary \n4  Kevin McAleenan and determined that he was not properly serving in his position when he \n5  promulgated the disputed regulation in that case in July 2019.  Id. at 1.  The court set aside and \n6  vacated the Final Rule, effectively invalidating it.  Id. at 10. \n7  33.  While the Final Rule in this case was issued when Chad Wolf was purportedly \n8  serving as the Acting Homeland Security Secretary, the Behring decision is clear that neither \n9  Mr. McAleenan nor Mr. Wolf were lawfully serving in their roles.  Id. at 4. \n10  34.  The Behring court followed several other decisions invalidating DHS regulations \n11  promulgated at the time that either Mr. McAleenan or Mr. Wolf were purportedly serving in \n12  their official roles.  The court noted that it:  \n13  “joins the numerous other courts which have held that because Secretary \n14  Nielsen amended the wrong Order of Succession when she purported to \n15  place the Customs and Border Protection Commissioner—Mr. \n16  McAleenan—third in line after the Deputy Secretary of Homeland \n17  Security and the Under Secretary of Management for succession to the \n18  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security position, Mr. McAleenan's \n19  appointment was invalid. See, e.g., La Clinica de la Raza v. Trump, No. \n20  19-CV-04980-PJH, 2020 WL 7053313, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 2020) \n21  (“former Secretary Nielsen's April 9th order did not alter the \n22  Department’s order of succession in cases of resignation and that \n23  Executive Order 13753 continued to govern the order of succession at the \n24  time of Secretary Nielsen’s resignation.”).” \n25  35.  The court also cited to no less than three cases holding that Mr. Wolf’s \n26  appointment was invalid.  In Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, 501 F. Supp. 3d 117, 132 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), \n27  the court held that “[b]ased on the plain text of the operative order of succession, neither Mr. \n28  McAleenan nor, in turn, Mr. Wolf, possessed statutory authority to serve as Acting Secretary.”  \n \n6 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 8 of 22\n \n1  In Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Wolf, 486 F. Supp. 3d 928, 960 (D. Md. 2020), appeal dismissed \n2  sub nom. Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Mayorkas, No. 20-2217 (L), 2021 WL 1923045 (4th Cir. \n3  Mar. 23, 2021), the court similarly found that “McAleenan's appointment was invalid under the \n4  agency’s applicable order of succession, and so he lacked the authority to amend the order of \n5  succession to ensure Wolf’s installation as Acting Secretary.”  In Pangea Legal Servs. v. U.S. \n6  Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 20-CV-09253-JD, 2021 WL 75756, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2021), \n7  the court ruled that “[b]ecause the passing of the torch from Nielsen to McAleenan was \n8  ineffective, the attempt by McAleenan to pass it in turn to Wolf had no legal effect whatsoever.  \n9  The entire succession argument under the [Homeland Security Act] consequently falls apart.”  \n10  36.  As observed by the Behring court, even the U.S. Government’s own Government \n11  Accountability Office (“GAO”) reached a similar conclusion.  See GAO, Homeland Security, \n12  File B-331650, (Aug. 14, 2020), https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf.  In that August \n13  2020 decision, the GAO concluded that although “Mr. McAleenan assumed the title of Acting \n14  Secretary upon the resignation of Secretary Nielsen, [ ] the express terms of the existing \n15  designation required another official to assume that title.  As such, Mr. McAleenan did not have \n16  the authority to amend the Secretary’s existing designation.”  See also Behring, 2021 WL \n17  2554051 at 5. \n18  37.  The Behring court also considered and rejected DHS’s attempt to have Secretary \n19  of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas ratify a Final Rule previously promulgated by an \n20  unauthorized official.  The Behring court addressed the case cited by Secretary Mayorkas in his \n21  ratification of the Final Rule in this case – Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & \n22  Explosives, 920 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2019), judgment entered, 762 F. App'x 7 (D.C. Cir. \n23  2019), and cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 789 (2020).  The Behring court found DHS’s reliance on \n24  Guedes misplaced.  The court ruled that DHS had violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of \n25  1998 (“FVRA”), and the Final Rule could therefore not be saved by Secretary Mayorkas’s after-\n26  the-fact ratification nor the de-facto officer doctrine.  Id. at 1, 9. \n27  38.  The Final Rule is therefore invalid, has no force or effect, and must be set aside \n28  and vacated.   \n \n7 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 9 of 22\n \n1  B.  The Administrative Review Process Is Fatally Flawed  \n2  39.  The Final Rule requires administrative exhaustion through $675 appeals of \n3  immigration bond breaches to the AAO.  If a bond breach is not formally appealed to the AAO, \n4  the bond obligor and surety forfeit any challenge to the bond breach determination in federal \n5  court.   \n6  40.  The AAO is not equipped to handle immigration bond breach appeals.   \n7  41.  There is no appeal process other than the submission of an initial appeal through \n8  submission of a government form.  While the surety or its agent may include arguments in \n9  support of their defenses with the appeal form, there is no briefing on the issues.  Nor is there \n10  any exchange of documents, and DHS does not provide any documents to the surety or its \n11  agent related to the breach determination.  There is no hearing.  A DHS officer simply makes a \n12  decision based on review of the appeal form. \n13  42.  In addition, the AAO rarely issues precedential decisions, and none have \n14  addressed immigration bond breaches.  Further, the AAO has not issued any precedential \n15  decisions adopting the legal findings of the court in United States of America v. Gonzales & \n16  Gonzales Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc., et al. (Case No. C 09-4029 EMC).  Those \n17  findings address the propriety of immigration bond breaches by DHS.   \n18  43.  The AAO’s standard of review is not codified in any statute or regulation.    \n19  44.  The AAO does not state how it determines which cases become precedent  \n20  decisions.  Nor does the AAO interact with local service centers and district offices to ensure \n21  that like cases are adjudicated in like manner. \n22  45.  The AAO has not published its appellate rules and statistics on decision making \n23  standards and data.   \n24  46.  The vast majority of all immigration bond breach appeals to the AAO are \n25  denied.   \n26  47.  Resorting to the AAO is futile, expensive, time-consuming, and without any due \n27  process safeguards.  The substantial expenses, coupled with the futility of an AAO appeal, has \n28  resulted in many sureties choosing an informal written dispute methodology for challenging  \n \n8 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 10 of 22\n \n1  bond breaches, rather than pursuing relief through the AAO.  \n2  C.  Whether Through the AAO or a Written Dispute, DHS Refuses to Produce \n3  A-files for Bonds Where it Has Declared an Obligor or Surety to Be in \n4  Breach  \n5  48.  The A-file contains many documents that are relevant to disputed bond breach \n6  claims.  These documents assist the surety in (1) identifying available defenses under the terms \n7  of the bond, (2) locating and producing the alien to DHS, and (3) mitigating damages claimed \n8  by DHS.   \n9  49.  DHS produces little, if any, documents when declaring an immigration bond \n10  breach.  DHS thereby prevents the sureties from being able to properly challenge DHS’s bond \n11  breach declarations.  The Final Rule authorizes DHS to continue this pattern of non-production \n12  while also demanding payment.    \n13  50.  This violates a decision in U.S. v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Ins. Agency, \n14  Inc. (N.D. Cal., Sept. 25, 2012, No. C-09-4029 EMC).  There, the court ordered DHS to apply \n15  certain standards for review of disputes over its bond breach determinations.  DHS was ordered \n16  to produce the entirety of the A-files, and to “consider each defense for each bond and provide a \n17  decision for each bond breach determination, with an explanation of its reasons for accepting or \n18  rejecting each defense as to each bond found to be breached.  Such reasoned decisions will \n19  permit this Court to correctly apply an arbitrary and capricious standard of review in keeping  \n20  with 8 C.F.R. § 103.6(e).”   \n21  51.  DHS was further ordered to “evaluate these positions in a fair and neutral \n22  manner, upon the entirety of the administrative record before it. DHS shall then issue a reasoned \n23  decision and certify the administrative record, stating which parts of the record it believes \n24  deserves weight, and the reasons why.”  U.S. v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Ins. Agency, \n25  Inc., 2012 WL 4462915, at 9 (N.D. Cal., Sept. 25, 2012, No. C-09-4029 EMC).   \n26  52.  None of these requirements are mentioned in the Final Rule.    \n27  53.  The requirement that an immigration bond agent or surety pursue a $675  \n28  administrative appeal of an immigration bond breach declaration made by DHS fails to follow  \n \n9 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 11 of 22\n \n1  DHS’s own procedure for reviewing disputes over its bond breach determinations.  Reference in \n2  the Final Rule is made to both an appeal to the AAO or, alternatively, the submission of a \n3  written dispute to DHS.  It remains unclear whether DHS is requiring an appeal to the AAO in \n4  order to seek judicial review, or whether a surety may also challenge a bond breach \n5  determination by written dispute.  With the written dispute process still authorized in the Final \n6  Rule, it is inconsistent to require AAO exhaustion when this written dispute remedy exists to \n7  challenge a bond breach determination.  \n8  54.  Further, for at least the past eight years, DHS has used a procedure whereby a \n9  bond agent or surety may submit a written dispute to DHS for review and a determination \n10  whether to uphold the breach or cancel the bond.  While this process continues to have its flaws, \n11  it provides a better alternative to the AAO for review of disputed bond breach determinations.   \n12  55.  It remains unclear how AAO review would function within this established \n13  written dispute process.  The Final Rule requires an AAO appeal within 30 days of a breach \n14  determination, but a surety is already permitted 30 days to submit a written dispute.  If it \n15  chooses to submit a written dispute, it will effectively be time-barred from submitting an appeal \n16  to the AAO.    \n17  56.  The 30-day deadline for appealing to the AAO also fails to allow enough time \n18  for a surety to discuss the circumstances of a bond breach with the alien or indemnitor.   DHS \n19  only sends a notice of a bond breach.  DHS does not send any documents supporting the breach \n20  determination.  It takes at least an additional 60 days for a surety or its agent to receive a \n21  “Record of Proceedings” from DHS.  The Record of Proceedings is what DHS claims are the \n22  documents relevant to support its breach determination.  By the time the surety or its agent \n23  receives these documents, they were already required to file an appeal of the breach  \n24  determination and raise all their defenses.  \n25  57.  In addition, the Record of Proceedings is insufficient and does not include all \n26  documents necessary for a surety or its agent to prepare and file their appeal.  It only includes a \n27  limited number of documents selected by DHS that only purport to support DHS’s bond breach \n28  claim.   \n \n10 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 12 of 22\n \n1  58.   Sureties or their agents are not provided the A-File, which is required by court \n2  decisions addressing immigration bond breach appeals.  And documents requested through a \n3  Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request and that are related to the bond breach \n4  determination take even longer to be produced.  Yet, the Final Rule requires the surety or its \n5  agent to have already appealed the breach decision and raised all arguments in support of its \n6  position within 30 days of receipt of the breach notice.  This time constraint makes it  \n7  impossible to prepare a proper and timely appeal.    \n8  59.  In contrast, those who post cash immigration bonds are not required to exhaust \n9  administrative remedies through an appeal to the AAO.  If an individual posts a cash bond, he \n10  or she may challenge DHS’s breach determination in federal court without the requirement of \n11  filing an AAO appeal.    \n12  60.  DHS is also applying the Final Rule retroactively in violation of U.S. Supreme \n13  Court precedent.  In Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., supra, 488 U.S. 204, 208, the Court \n14  held that “[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law ... [and] congressional enactments and \n15  administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language \n16  requires this result.”  A law or regulation operates retroactively if it “impair[s] rights a party \n17  possessed when he acted, increase[s] a party's liability for past conduct, or impose[s] new duties \n18  with respect to transactions already completed.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, \n19  280 (1994). \n20  61.  DHS is applying the requirement of an AAO appeal to bonds posted prior to \n21  adoption of the Final Rule.  The sureties and their agents entered into contracts with aliens and \n22  indemnitors based on the mutual understanding and agreement between all the parties, \n23  including DHS, that there was no requirement of administrative exhaustion to challenge a bond \n24  breach.  DHS has now altered this understanding and effectively changed the terms of the \n25  posted bonds to implement this requirement.  As such, the Final Rule is unlawful as it is being \n26  applied retroactively.   \n27  D.  No Statute Authorizes DHS to Decertify Sureties \n28  62.  Congress has not delegated to DHS the authority to establish its own  \n \n11 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 13 of 22\n \n1  standards for the declination of a surety’s bonds. \n2  63.  The Final Rule conflicts with 31 U.S.C. §§ 9304-9308 and impermissibly alters \n3  these code sections without Congressional approval or authority.  It allows DHS to usurp the \n4  authority of the Treasury as the sole Government agency authorized by Congress to approve and \n5  revoke the authority of a surety to provide surety bonds.   \n6  64.  The Final Rule allows DHS to decline to accept any and all bonds underwritten \n7  by a Treasury-certified surety whenever DHS claims (1) ten or more invoices issued to the \n8  surety on “administratively final breach determinations” are “past due”, or (2) the surety “owes” \n9  a cumulative total of $50,000 or more on “past due” invoices issued to the surety on \n10  “administratively final breach determinations,”1 or (3) the surety has a “breach” rate of 35 \n11  percent or greater based on a comparison of “administratively final breach determinations” and \n12  bond cancellations.   \n13  65.  No code section authorizes such arbitrary power.  The only code section that \n14  addresses the ability of a surety to do business is 31 U.S.C. 9305, and that section clearly and \n15  unambiguously provides that only Treasury may revoke the authority of a surety corporation to \n16  do new business, and it may do so only if (1) the Secretary decides the corporation is insolvent, \n17  or (2) is in violation of sections 9304, 9305 or 9306.  None of these three sections authorize \n18  revocation if there is an outstanding unpaid bond obligation.  Nor are these regulatory \n19  “changes,” as claimed by DHS.  Rather, they are entirely new regulations.  And there is no \n20  reference in these regulations to any recently passed legislation authorizing them.   \n21  66.  These regulations effectively grant DHS the authority to revoke a surety’s \n22  certification by bypassing the one and only statutory scheme governing revocation of a surety’s \n23  certification.     \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n1 With the increasingly high penal sum of bonds being written, this cumulative \n28 \nmaximum could very well involve one disputed bond breach determination.  \n \n12 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 14 of 22\n \n1  E.  Only Treasury Has Limited Authority to Prevent a Surety from Conducting \n2  Business  \n3  67.  By providing agencies such as DHS with the authority to refuse bonds from \n4  certain sureties, the Final Rule conflicts with 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308, which specifically authorize \n5  Treasury to certify and decertify sureties posting federal bonds.  The “background” section of \n6  the Final Rule confirms that Treasury is responsible for administering the corporate Federal \n7  surety bond program under the authority of 31 U.S.C. §§ 9304-9308.  Treasury does not have \n8  the right to delegate, by regulation or otherwise, its exclusive authority to administer federal \n9  surety bonds. \n10  68.  31 U.S.C. 9305 clearly and unambiguously provides that Treasury may revoke \n11  the authority of a surety corporation to do new business only if (1) the Secretary decides the \n12  corporation is insolvent, or (2) is in violation of sections 9304, 9305 or 9306.  None of these \n13  three sections authorize DHS to reject a bond issued by a surety who has an outstanding unpaid \n14  bond obligation that DHS contends is due and owing.  \n15  69.  31 U.S.C. 9305(e) precludes the writing of an additional bond only if the surety \n16  has not paid a final judgment that has not been appealed.  The Final Rules allows DHS to \n17  replace this “final judgment” provision of 31 U.S.C. 9305(e) with DHS’s claim that there are \n18  “past due” invoices on “administratively final breach determinations.”  A final judgment is no \n19  longer required even though Congress specified this requirement.  DHS’s utilization of a \n20  standard that is far more stringent than the standard Congress has provided to Treasury violates \n21  due process and runs afoul of specific Congressional intent on the subject. \n22  70.  There is no authority for these changes to the code section.  The regulations \n23  impermissibly alter statutory mandates and create new law by allowing DHS to administer the \n24  Federal surety bond program.  The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected such regulations.  In Bowen \n25  v. Georgetown University Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988), the Court held that it is axiomatic \n26  that an administrative agency’s power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the \n27  authority delegated by Congress. \n28  71.  In Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 297  \n \n13 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 15 of 22\n \n1  U.S. 129, 134-135 (1936), emphasis added, the Court held that: \n2  “[t]he power of an administrative officer or board to administer a federal \n3  statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is not the power \n4  to make law, for no such power can be delegated by Congress, but the \n5  power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as \n6  expressed by the statute.  A regulation which does not do this, but \n7  operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity \n8  . . . And not only must a regulation, in order to be valid, be consistent \n9  with the statute, but it must be reasonable.”  \n10  72.  Further, where a Treasury statute is unambiguous, and its directions specific, \n11  there is no power to amend it by regulation.  Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U.S. 441, 446-447, 56 \n12  S.Ct. 767, 769 - 770 (1936).  See also Goodson-Todman Enterprises, Ltd. v. Commissioner, 784 \n13  F.2d 66, 74 (2d Cir.1986) (“A Treasury regulation may therefore be declared invalid . . . if it is \n14  unreasonable or clearly contrary to the language or spirit of the statute it purports to \n15  implement”).   \n16  73.  Congress delegated to Treasury (rather than DHS) the sole authority to decertify \n17  sureties because Treasury has expertise in financial matters and the financial surveillance of \n18  sureties authorized to write federal bonds.  DHS does not have the expertise to conduct due \n19  process hearings regarding the value of a security, and more importantly, DHS has a conflict of \n20  interest in conducting such proceedings because its goal in refusing to accept immigration \n21  bonds is to force the surety to pay invoiced bonds, even though the underlying breaches may be \n22  disputed.  This creates an incentive for DHS, whose AAO unit is ostensibly reviewing bond \n23  breaches impartially, to uphold its breaches.   \n24  74.  The current federal statutes provide a vehicle to address a recalcitrant surety.  \n25  Treasury has hearings providing substantial rights to the surety to contest the allegations of a  \n26  disgruntled agency. \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n14 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 16 of 22\n \n1  F.  The Regulations Alter the Existing Standard of Review in Decertification \n2  Proceedings  \n3  75.  The regulations allow DHS to refuse all immigration bonds by a surety if DHS \n4  determines that “administratively final breach determinations” are “past due.”  This is no \n5  different than decertification.  Such a harsh, drastic decision is limited, and only permitted \n6  under 31 U.S.C. 9305(e)(1), which precludes the writing of an additional bond only if the surety \n7  has not paid a final judgment that has not been appealed.    \n8  76.  The Final Rule would result in unprecedented deference to DHS to make the law, \n9  to produce only those records it deems necessary to produce (even if the records in DHS’s \n10  possession would refute DHS’s claim on the bond), and to adopt without challenge only those \n11  interpretations most advantageous to the agency.   \n12  77.  DHS’s interpretation of the law is not the law.  The law and the interpretation of \n13  statutes are decided by the courts, not by a governmental agency attempting to collect debt to \n14  pay for its programs.  Many of the issues that the sureties rely upon in refusing payment have \n15  been adjudicated against DHS.  To allow DHS to refuse bonds, i.e. decertify a company, based \n16  on erroneous interpretations of law that are subject to judicial challenge is a deprivation of due \n17  process.  \n18  G.  The For Cause Standards are Flawed and Anticompetitive  \n19  78.  DHS identifies three metrics that it will use to determine whether it will continue \n20  to accept immigration bonds from a surety.  If the surety does not meet any one of these \n21  “standards”, DHS can decline all future immigration bonds from that surety.  These “for cause” \n22  measurements are arbitrary, fail to reflect a surety’s performance in paying legally valid bond  \n23  breach determinations, and penalize sureties and their agents in favor of cash bond obligors. \n24  79.  First, DHS treats a single, $50,000 immigration bond invoice the same as ten \n25  invoices which may total far less than $50,000.  Treating a single bond breach as equivalent to \n26  ten bond breaches is arbitrary and makes little sense.  There must be consistency in any standard \n27  used by the government to determine whether it will prevent a surety from conducting business.             \n28  80.  Another “for cause” standard uses a breach rate calculation.  DHS proposes to  \n \n15 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 17 of 22\n \n1  take the number of bond breaches from October 1 to September 30 of the preceding year and \n2  divide that by the number of bond breaches and number of cancelled bonds during that same \n3  year.  This is flawed and unfair for several reasons.  DHS makes clear in its preamble to the \n4  Final Rule that it has had a problem with the failure to pay breaches by sureties and their agents.  \n5  This is the sole purpose identified by DHS for the Final Rule.  By trying to monitor \n6  performance of a surety, the 35% breach rate calculation as a “for cause” reason to refuse \n7  certain bonds is not in furtherance of DHS’s stated purpose in enacting the Final Rule.   \n8  81.  It is also arbitrary to set a snapshot time frame to make a breach rate calculation.  \n9  A surety may have several cancellations a few days or weeks before the start of a fiscal year or \n10  shortly after the fiscal year concludes.  A surety could be slightly over the 35% threshold during \n11  one fiscal year, and under it the previous and subsequent fiscal years.  Being above or below the \n12  35% number could thus become a function of luck more than anything else.  Further, by \n13  creating calculation periods, a surety or agent would be incentivized to seek cancellations or \n14  challenge breaches, and time them so that a breach or cancellation would fall prior to or after a \n15  fiscal year begins.    \n16  82.  Moreover, DHS’s failure to include all outstanding bonds issued by the surety in \n17  determining a breach rate calculation is unfair.  A surety can have 5 breaches and 8 \n18  cancellations during a fiscal year, for a 38% “breach rate.”  But it may have an additional 87 \n19  bonds outstanding during that fiscal year.  The number of breaches in comparison to the number \n20  of outstanding bonds plus cancelled bonds would be 5%.  Rather than use this number to \n21  calculate a breach rate, DHS ignores bonds that have not been breached or cancelled.  Those \n22  bonds can most certainly end up being cancelled as the years proceed, thereby substantially \n23  lowering the breach rate that was calculated as of a certain date based on a very small statistical \n24  sampling.  But that would count for nothing during that particular breach rate calculation.  DHS \n25  instead will extrapolate a breach rate by arguing that the breach rate will remain consistent as \n26  the outstanding bonds are either breached or cancelled over a very long period of time.  There is \n27  no basis for such a methodology, no statistical analysis for calculating a breach rate in this \n28  fashion, and DHS offers no explanation in support of its arbitrary standard.  In short, DHS relies \n \n16 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 18 of 22\n \n1  on speculation of future breaches and cancellations to justify its refusal to allow the posting of  \n2  bonds from a surety.  This is another example of a due process violation.  Under DHS’s \n3  standard, there would be nothing to challenge before DHS simply refused to accept any further \n4  immigration bonds from a Treasury approved surety company. DHS seeks to deny the ability of \n5  a surety or agent to post a bond by using an untested and unapproved extrapolation model.              \n6  83.  The “for cause” standards are also anticompetitive.  They create unfair \n7  measurements for surety bonds, while failing to impose the same standards for cash bonds.  The \n8  government contends that it can simply take the cash posted for a cash bond and therefore does \n9  not need to set any requirements for cash bond obligors.  But this is a tacit acknowledgement \n10  that DHS has no problem with bond breaches, as long as they are paid.  Yet, DHS’s breach rate \n11  calculation punishes surety bond obligors by counting paid bond breaches against them.  \n12  Payment by cash bond obligors has absolved them of any repercussions as they are not subject \n13  to the Final Rule.  On the other hand, payment by surety bond obligors does not absolve them \n14  from being punished as paid bond breaches count against them.  This favors cash bond obligors \n15  and, in turn, manipulates the immigration bond market by punishing all surety bond companies \n16  and their agents, regardless of whether they pay breaches or not.  \n17  84.  As with other attempts to manipulate a market arbitrarily and without sufficient \n18  research, there will be unintended consequences.  It will become more difficult for those \n19  seeking release from DHS detention pending review of their immigration status to be released.  \n20  Surety bonds will become less available and fewer individuals will be released as cash bonds \n21  will not be affordable to many.  Detention will increase, costing the government even more \n22  money to fund and administer newly needed detention space.     \n23  85.  The Final Rule is irrational, arbitrary, contrary to law, and an unjustified reversal  \n24  of past practice.  It must be set aside under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D) (rules \n25  issued “without observance of procedure required by law,” “not in accordance with law,” or “in \n26  excess of statutory authority” must be set aside). \n27  H.  DHS’s Review Has Proven Futile  \n28  86.  The Final Rule authorizes DHS to administer the Federal surety bond program  \n \n17 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 19 of 22\n \n1  even though DHS has been found in court decisions to not abide by its agreements and \n2  established law regarding immigration bonds and breach determinations.  DHS’s \n3  “administratively final” determinations that an immigration bond has been breached have been \n4  made in error, as determined by the federal court in United States of America v. Gonzales & \n5  Gonzales Bonds and Insurance Agency, Inc., et al. (Case No. C 09-4029 EMC).   \n6  87.  In United States of America v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds and Insurance \n7  Agency, Inc., et al. (Case No. C 09-4029 EMC), the court ruled that the obligations set forth in \n8  statutes, regulations, case law, and the terms specified in the immigration bonds themselves \n9  must all be considered when the agency declares a bond breach.  The court also held that a \n10  surety is entitled to review of the entire A-file, with the exception of privileged documents, to \n11  determine if DHS’s administratively final breach declaration is proper.  This exacting judicial \n12  review is a far cry from the Final Rule, which simply allows DHS to reject sureties and seek \n13  their decertification by claiming that it has declared an immigration bond breach to be \n14  administratively final.  \n15  88.  In Gonzales & Gonzales, the surety initially asserted 17 bonds in a counterclaim \n16  where it claimed that DHS’s administratively final breach determination was in error.  DHS \n17  then sought to remand 11 of the 17 bonds where it too felt its initial breach determination was in \n18  error.  That amounts to an admitted 65% error rate by DHS.  If the Final Rule had been in effect \n19  at that time, DHS could have simply declared that 11 bonds were due and owing from the \n20  surety, and it would therefore no longer allow immigration bonds to be posted by that surety.   \n21  89.  As the case proceeded, the court ruled that DHS abused its discretion in making \n22  bond breach determinations in a majority of bonds presented for summary judgment by the \n23  parties.  The rulings were then applied to all the disputed immigration bond breach \n24  determinations made by DHS on bonds posted by the surety. The result was that hundreds of \n25  bonds DHS declared as breached and “past due” were erroneously declared breached and were \n26  not, therefore, past due.   \n27  90.  The Final Rule eviscerates this necessary judicial review and allows DHS to \n28  threaten to cut off their business unless sureties pay up, regardless of whether DHS is wrong on  \n \n18 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 36   Filed 08/03/21   Page 20 of 22\n \n1  the law.   \n2  COUNT I \n3  (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n4  91.

Under the APA, a court must set “aside agency action” that is “not in \n6  accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n7  93.  The issuance of the Final Rule was an agency action. \n8  94.

Under the APA, a court must set “aside agency action” that is “not in accordance \n19  with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n20  99.  The APA states that a court must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \n21  that is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \n22  law; … (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \n23  right;… (D) without observance of procedure required by law …” or “(E) unsupported by \n24  substantial evidence.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits Defendants from \n11  denying any person the equal protection of the laws.  \n12  104.  The Final Rule favors cash bond obligors over Treasury-approved sureties who \n13  post immigration bonds.  It creates a dual legal system whereby cash bond obligors need not \n14  exhaust administrative remedies while reserving their rights to challenge a bond breach in \n15  federal court.  On the other hand, in order to reserve their rights to challenge a bond breach in \n16  federal court, sureties must quickly appeal a bond breach and pursue administrative relief \n17  without being provided necessary due process safeguards  \n18  105.  On this basis, DHS has violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \n19  Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n20  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n21  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n22  1.

USDHS  3 \nSecretary Chad Wolf promulgated a rule permitting DHS to \nrefuse business from certain surety firms (the “Rule”).  But, \nas the panel explained, Wolf was not duly appointed under \nthe applicable law and thus lacked authority to promulgate \nthe  Rule.   In  2021,  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security \nAlejandro Mayorkas, who was duly appointed, ratified the \nRule.   \nThe panel held that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of \n1998 (“FVRA”) did not bar Mayorkas from ratifying the \nRule, and that ratification cured any defects in the Rule’s \npromulgation.  The panel explained that the Ratification Bar, \n5  U.S.C.  § 3348(d)(2),  prohibits  ratification  of  certain \nactions taken by a purported officer serving in violation of \nthe FVRA.  The panel concluded that the Ratification Bar \napplies  only  to  “functions  or  duties”  that  are \n“nondelegable.”   By  the  statute’s  own  definition,  the \nRatification Bar applies only to nondelegable functions or \nduties because only nondelegable functions or duties are \n“required by statute [or regulation] to be performed by the \napplicable  officer  (and  only  that  officer).”   5  U.S.C. \n§3348(a)(2).\nJudge Johnstone concurred in the lead opinion except for\nits conclusion that the meaning of the phrase “the applicable \nofficer (and only that officer)” is plain.  Looking to extrinsic \nevidence from the court’s co-equal branches to resolve this \nambiguity,  Judge  Johnstone  nonetheless  concluded  that \n“function or duty” includes only the officer’s nondelegable \nduties.  \nDissenting, Judge Christen wrote that the text, structure, \nand purpose of the FVRA make clear that application of the \nratification  bar  does  not  turn  on  whether  a  duty  is \ndelegable.  Rather, the ratification bar applies to all functions \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 4 of 64\n4  GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nand duties that Congress assigns to a single officer (and \nexcludes functions and duties that Congress authorizes more \nthan one officer to perform).  Judge Christen wrote that the \nmajority’s decision renders the FVRA a near-dead letter by \ndeciding that the FVRA does not apply to the vast majority \nof  actions  taken  by  officials  serving  in  violation  of  the \nFVRA. \nCOUNSEL \nJoseph C.

AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS  5 \nOPINION \nBEA, Circuit Judge: \nIn  certain  immigration  cases,  the  Department  of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”) requires a bond—similar to a \nbail bond in criminal cases—to avoid detention of the alien \npending deportation.  The bond secures a promise that the \nalien will appear for immigration proceedings, which will \ndetermine whether the alien can remain in the United States. \nCommercial firms, known as sureties, provide such bonds. \nIn 2020, the “Acting Secretary” of the DHS promulgated a \nrule that permitted the agency to refuse business from certain \nsurety  firms  that  were  serially  delinquent  in  making \npayments  for  absconding  aliens  or  that  had  garnered  a \nreputation for posting bonds for frequent absconders.  See \nProcedures and Standards for Declining Surety Immigration \nBonds  and  Administrative  Appeal  Requirement  for \nBreaches, 85 Fed. Reg. 45968, 45968–69 (July 31, 2020) \n(the “Rule”). \nBut some of those sureties that were not too fond of this \nnew Rule, which cut into their business, realized that the \n“Acting Secretary” who promulgated the Rule may not have \nbeen duly appointed.  Hence, the Rule might be invalid and \nthe sureties might have been improperly banned from doing \nbusiness with the DHS. \nUnfortunately  for  the  sureties’  pretensions,  in  2021 \nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, who \nwas duly appointed, ratified the Rule.  But that leaves the \nquestion—does the exercise of ratification cure the alleged \ndefect in the Rule’s promulgation?  We hold that it does. \nUnder  principles  of  agency  law  and  Circuit  precedent, \nSecretary Mayorkas had the authority to ratify an action \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 6 of 64\n6  GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \ntaken by an improperly appointed Acting Secretary, who \nwould not otherwise have been authorized to take that action. \nSee Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Gordon, 819 F.3d 1179, \n1190–92 (9th Cir. 2016).  But there was a possible hurdle to \nthe exercise of ratification.  Under the so-called “Ratification \nBar,” Secretary Mayorkas could not ratify promulgation of \nthe Rule if such promulgation could be performed only by \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security himself.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§3348(a)(2), (d)(2).\nWe conclude that the Secretary had the authority to\ndelegate promulgation of the Rule; it was not a function or \nduty singularly entrusted to the Secretary.  See 6 U.S.C. \n§112(b)(1).  Because the Secretary could have delegated\npromulgation of the Rule, Secretary Mayorkas could ratify\nthe 2020 promulgation of the Rule, regardless whether the\nRule’s promulgation had been actually delegated.  Thus,\nratification of the Rule by Secretary Mayorkas cured any\ndefect in the Rule’s promulgation.\nThe  question  in  this  case  is  whether  5  U.S.C. \n§3348(d)(2),  the  Ratification  Bar,  which  prohibits\nratification of certain actions taken by a purported officer\nserving in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of\n1998 (“FVRA”), applies only to “functions or duties” that\nare  singularly  entrusted  by  statute  or  regulation  to  that\nofficer, and in other words are “nondelegable.”  We hold that\nit  does.    By  the  statute’s  own  definition,1  § 3348(d)’s\nRatification Bar applies only to nondelegable functions or\nduties because only nondelegable functions or duties are\n“required by statute [or regulation] to be performed by the\napplicable  officer  (and  only  that  officer).”    5  U.S.C.\n1 Judge Johnstone concurs in this opinion, except for its conclusion that \nthe meaning of the statute is plain and unambiguous.  Con. Op. 33–34. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 7 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS  7 \n§3348(a)(2).  Thus, we hold that the district court erred in\ngranting Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment because\nthe FVRA did not bar Secretary Mayorkas from ratifying the\nRule, and that ratification cured any defects in the Rule’s\n2020 promulgation.\nI. BACKGROUND\nArticle II of the Constitution gives the President the\nauthority to appoint “Officers of the United States,” but \nrequires the President to obtain the “Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate” to make those appointments effective.  U.S. \nCONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  To avoid negative repercussions of \nvacancies in those positions, “Congress has long accounted \nfor th[e] reality” of vacancies “by authorizing the President \nto direct certain officials to temporarily carry out the duties \nof a vacant . . . office in an acting capacity, without Senate \nconfirmation.”  NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., 580 U.S. 288, 293 \n(2017).  The current version of that authorization is the \nFVRA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345–49e. \nUnder the FVRA, when an Executive agency officer \n“whose appointment to office is required to be made by the \nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, \ndies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions \nand duties of the office[,] the first assistant to the office of \nsuch officer shall perform the functions and duties of the \noffice  temporarily  in  an  acting  capacity,”  5  U.S.C. \n§3345(a)(1),  unless  the  President  selects  either  another\nofficer who was previously Presidentially appointed and\nSenate-confirmed or an officer or employee of the same\nagency who has served a specified time in that agency, id.\n§3345(a)(2)–(3).\nThe  FVRA  is  the  “exclusive  means  for  temporarily\nauthorizing an acting official to perform the functions and \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 8 of 64\n8  GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

Id. \n§3347(a).\nIn  December  2016,  President  Obama  exercised  his\nauthority under § 3345(a) to establish an order of succession \nfor the Office of Secretary of Homeland Security in case of \nan office vacancy.  Exec. Order No. 13753, 81 Fed. Reg. \n90667 (Dec. 9, 2016) (“Executive Order 13753”).  Later that \nmonth, Congress amended the Homeland Security Act to \ngive  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  independent \nauthority to create an order of succession, but did not change \nthe order of succession established by President Obama’s \nExecutive Order 13753.  National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2017, Pub. L. No. 114-328, § 1903, 130 \nStat. 2000, 2672 (2016) (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)).  \nPresident Obama signed the Act, and it became law. \nA. Chad Wolf’s Ascension to “Acting Secretary” of\nthe DHS\nIn April 2019, Kirsjten Nielsen, on her last day of service \nas Secretary of Homeland Security, modified an order titled \n“DHS Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authority \nfor Named Positions,” also known as Delegation 00106. \nDelegation 00106, both before and as amended, provided in \nsubparts II.A–B: \nA.

In a document titled “Amending the \nOrder  of  Succession  in  the  Department  of  Homeland \nSecurity,” Secretary Nielsen invoked her authority under 6 \nU.S.C.  § 113(g)(2),  and  “designate[d]  the  order  of \nsuccession  for  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  as \nfollow[ed].”    What  followed  were  instructions  to  strike \nAnnex A and replace it with a new list, still titled “Annex A. \nOrder for Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.”  Notably,  Secretary \nNielsen  did  not  change  the  text  of  Delegation  00106, \nsubpart II.A; so, Annex A, both before and after Secretary \nNielsen’s  order,  applied  only  to  delegations  occurring \n“during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.”  As a result, \nabsent  a  delegation  during  a  disaster  or  catastrophic \nemergency,  subpart  II.A,  “the  orderly  succession  of \nofficials” to the Secretary’s office, was still “governed by \nExecutive Order 13753.” \nAs of Secretary Nielsen’s last day in office, the list of \nnames in Secretary Nielsen’s Annex A and Executive Order \n13753 differed.

USDHS \nHomeland  Security,  (2) the  Under  Secretary  for \nManagement, (3) the Commissioner of Customs and Border \nProtection (“CBP”), and (4) the Administrator of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), in that order.  \nIn contrast, Executive Order 13753’s order of succession \nbegan with the same first two positions as Annex A, (1) the \nDeputy Secretary of Homeland Security and (2) the Under \nSecretary  for  Management,  but  then  it  listed  (3) the \nAdministrator of FEMA (rather than the Commissioner of \nCBP)  followed  by  (4) the  Under  Secretary  for  National \nProtection and Programs (“NPP”), renamed the Director of \nthe  Cybersecurity  and  Infrastructure  Security  Agency \n(“CISA”) (rather than the Administrator of FEMA).2  81 \nFed.

No one disputes that there was no \napplicable “disaster or catastrophic emergency” on that day. \nSo, under the operative orders—Delegation 00106, subpart \nII.A, and Executive Order 13753—and because the FEMA\nAdministrator office was also vacant, the Director of the\nCISA, Christopher Krebs, should have assumed the role of\nActing Secretary, rather than McAleenan.

AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 11 \ndid not do so; instead, McAleenan assumed the role.  Thus, \nMcAleenan was not a duly appointed Acting Secretary. \nNonetheless, in November 2019, McAleenan amended \nDelegation 00106, changing subpart II.A to reference Annex \nA  instead  of  Executive  Order  13753.    McAleenan  also \namended Annex A, replacing the fourth position with the \nUnder  Secretary  for  Strategy,  Policy,  and  Plans.    Soon \nthereafter, McAleenan resigned, and because the first three \npositions of Annex A were vacant, the Under Secretary for \nStrategy, Policy, and Plans—Chad Wolf—became “Acting \nSecretary”  pursuant  to  McAleenan’s  purported  order  of \nsuccession, rather than the Director of the CISA, Christopher \nKrebs, as would have ensued under Executive Order 13753.  \nNo one disputes that there was no applicable “disaster or \ncatastrophic emergency” on that day either.  Hence, Wolf \nwas no more duly appointed than had been McAleenan. \nB. “Acting Secretary” Wolf’s Promulgation of the\nRule\nAs noted, the DHS has a policy of releasing aliens from \ncustody while removal proceedings are pending if they post \nan immigration bond, a guarantee that the alien will appear \nupon  government  request  for  future  proceedings  or \notherwise  cooperate  with  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) officials.

USDHS \nasserts this has deprived the DHS of millions of dollars.  See \nid. at 45970.  \nTo address this concern, Wolf promulgated the Rule in \nJuly 2020 while purportedly serving as “Acting Secretary.” \nSee id. at 45968.  The Rule delegated to ICE the discretion \nto reject surety bonds from companies with outstanding \nbalances owed and unpaid to the DHS or with high breach \nrates, and further required administrative exhaustion, filings \nand procedures within DHS by sureties wishing to challenge \nDHS bond-breach decisions, prior to the sureties seeking \nrelief by filing actions in court.  See id. at 45971–73. \nC. Procedural History and Ratification of the Rule\nIn  December  2020,  five  companies  engaged  in  the \nbusiness of posting immigration surety bonds with the DHS \n(“Plaintiffs”)  sued  the  DHS,  ICE,  Wolf,  and  Kenneth \nCuccinelli, under the title of Senior Official Performing the \nDuties  of  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security \n(collectively, “the government”) in the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of California, claiming that \nthe  Rule  should  be  set  aside  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06.3  Plaintiffs \nargued the Rule had not been properly promulgated because \nWolf was not properly serving as Acting Secretary of DHS \nwhen he purported to promulgate the Rule.   \nHowever, in April 2021, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \nwho no one disputes was properly appointed by President \nBiden and confirmed by the Senate, ratified the Rule, stating \nthat  he  had  “full  knowledge”  of  the  Rule  and  believed \nratification  was  “consistent  with  the  Department’s \n3 The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a United States Magistrate \nJudge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 13 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

USDHS 13 \nauthorities.”    In  August  2021,  Plaintiffs  amended  their \ncomplaint to state that Secretary Mayorkas did not have the \nauthority to ratify Wolf’s promulgation of the Rule, but the \ngovernment  nonetheless  moved  to  dismiss  the  amended \ncomplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  \nIn denying the government’s motion to dismiss the amended \ncomplaint,  the  district  court  held  that  Wolf  had  never \nlawfully  held  the  title  of  “Acting  Secretary”  and  that \nSecretary Mayorkas’s ratification of the Rule was barred by \n“the  FVRA’s  plain  and  unambiguous  language,”  the \nRatification Bar. \nIn May 2022, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment \non the issue whether the “Rule was lawfully promulgated.” \nThe district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion predominantly \nfor the same reasons it had earlier denied the government’s \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the amended complaint.  On the \nquestion whether  Wolf  was validly appointed as Acting \nSecretary, the district court found that Secretary Nielsen \nfailed properly to amend the order of succession, rendering \nMcAleenan’s  and  Wolf’s  purported  ascension  to  Acting \nSecretary  invalid  and  their  service  improper.    On  the \nquestion whether Secretary Mayorkas’s ratification cured \nthe defect, the district court echoed its previous order and \nheld that the FVRA barred ratification of the improperly \npromulgated Rule.  The district court granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for summary judgment and vacated the Rule.  The \nPlaintiff sureties were back in business.  But the government \ntimely appealed. \nII.

DHS Order of Succession\nOn Secretary Nielsen’s last day serving as Secretary of \nHomeland Security, she failed to amend Delegation 00106, \nsubpart II.A—the order of succession to her office “[i]n case \nof the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform \nthe functions of the Office.”  Instead, she amended Annex \nA—the order of delegation in the event she was “unavailable \nto act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency” pursuant \nto Delegation 00106, subpart II.B.  Hence, her amended \norder of delegation could be effective only during a “disaster \nor catastrophic emergency.”  The parties do not dispute that \nneither  McAleenan’s  nor  Wolf’s  succession  to  the \nsecretaryship of DHS occurred during such events.  Despite \nthe plain language of the order, the government has argued—\nand at least seven times failed to persuade district courts—\nthat  Secretary  Nielsen’s  error  should  be  excused.    See \nAsylumworks  v.  Mayorkas,  590  F.  Supp.  3d  11,  20–21 \n(D.D.C. 2022); Behring Reg’l Ctr. LLC v. Wolf, 544 F. Supp. \n3d 937, 943–44 (N.D. Cal. 2021); Chamber of Com. of U.S. \nv.

Md. 2020).\nAt this point, the government’s position that Secretary \nNielsen’s error should be excused seems, at best, untenable, \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 15 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 15 \nand at worst, frivolous.  And though the government assured \nus at oral argument that the government’s intentions were \nnot “nefarious,” Secretary Nielsen’s best intentions did not \ntransform the modification of Annex A into a modification \nof Delegation 00106, subpart II.A.  As a result, McAleenan \nimproperly assumed the role of “Acting Secretary” over \nChristopher Krebs, who was next in line under Executive \nOrder 13753.  Therefore, McAleenan was without authority \nin November 2019 to amend Delegation 00106, though his \nattempt demonstrated awareness that his predecessor should \nhave amended subpart II.A to reference Annex A instead of \nExecutive Order 13753.  When McAleenan resigned, Wolf \nimproperly assumed the role of “Acting Secretary” pursuant \nto McAleenan’s version of Annex A instead of Executive \nOrder 13753.  Therefore, “Acting Secretary” Wolf lacked \nauthority to promulgate the Rule.  Undeterred, Wolf went on \nto promulgate the contested Rule. \nB. Ratification and the FVRA’s Ratification Bar\nThis  raises  the  question  whether,  despite  Wolf’s \nimproper service as “Acting Secretary,” any defect in the \n2020  promulgation  of  the  Rule  was  cured  by  Secretary \nMayorkas’s 2021 ratification of the Rule, or whether any \nsuch ratification was barred by the FVRA. \n1. Secretary  Mayorkas’s  authority  to  ratify  the\nRule\nThe Supreme Court has instructed that when one officer \nacts without authority, the validity of an “‘after-the-fact’ \nauthorization” by another officer with authority to take the \naction “is at least presumptively governed by principles of \nagency law, and in particular the doctrine of ratification.” \nFEC v. NRA Pol. Victory Fund, 513 U.S. 88, 98 (1994); see \nGordon, 819 F.3d at 1191–92 (following this guidance and \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 16 of 64\n16 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \ndiscussing the Second and Third Restatements of Agency). \n“[T]he  party  [or  principal]  ratifying  should  be  able  not \nmerely to do the act ratified at the time the act was done, but \nalso at the time the ratification was made.”  Cook v. Tullis, \n85 U.S. 332, 338 (1874); see also RESTATEMENT (SECOND)\nOF AGENCY § 84(1) (AM. L. INST. 1958).  If properly ratified, \nthen the original act is normally treated as if it had been \nproperly  performed.    See  RESTATEMENT  (SECOND)  OF\nAGENCY § 100 cmt. a. \nWhere an invalidly appointed person takes an action on \nbehalf of an agency, a subsequent, valid ratification cures \nany deficiencies in the original appointment.  Gordon, 819 \nF.3d  at  1190–91.    In  Gordon,  the  Consumer  Financial\nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”) brought a civil enforcement\naction  against  a  lawyer  for  violations  of  the  Consumer\nFinancial  Protection  Act  based  on  unfair  and  deceptive\npractices.    Id.  at  1186.    The  lawyer  challenged  the\nprosecution on the grounds that the CFPB brought the action\nwhile being led by an improperly appointed Director.  Id.\nThe lawyer claimed the President had unconstitutionally\nappointed the Director.  Id.

But after the Supreme\nCourt rejected other similar appointments in NLRB v. Noel\nCanning, 573 U.S. 513, 518–19 (2014), President Obama\n“renominated” Cordray, and he was later confirmed by the\nSenate.  Gordon, 819 F.3d at 1185.  Cordray then ratified his\nprevious actions, including the enforcement action against\nthe lawyer.  Id. at 1186.  Analyzing the Second and Third\nRestatements of  Agency, this Court held that  Cordray’s\nproper appointment and his ratification of prior acts cured\nany claimed appointment defects under Article II of the\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 17 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 17 \nConstitution.    Id.  at  1191–92  (citing  RESTATEMENT\n(SECOND) OF AGENCY § 93(3)).  \nHere, we similarly find that Secretary Mayorkas, who \nwas appointed by President Biden and confirmed by the \nSenate in February 2021, had the authority under agency law \nto ratify the Rule in April 2021.  Like in Gordon, Secretary \nMayorkas ratified Wolf’s promulgation of the Rule.  At all \ntimes relevant here, it is undisputed that the principal—the \nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security—had  the  authority  to \n“establish such regulations; prescribe such forms of bond, \nreports, entries, and other papers; issue such instructions; \nand perform such other acts as he deems necessary for \ncarrying  out  his  authority.”    8  U.S.C.  § 1103(a)(3);  see \nGordon, 819 F.3d at 1191 (“[I]f the principal (here, CFPB) \nhad  authority  to  bring  the  action  in  question,  then  the \nsubsequent . . . ratification . . . is sufficient.”).  Because the \nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security  had  the  authority  to \npromulgate the Rule “at the time the act was done, [and] also \nat the time the ratification was made,” Secretary Mayorkas \nhad authority under agency law to ratify the Rule.  See \nGordon, 819 F.3d at 1191 (quoting NRA Pol. Victory Fund, \n513 U.S. at 98) (emphasis removed); see also Kajmowicz v. \nWhitaker, 42 F.4th 138, 147 (3d Cir. 2022) (“If a lawfully \nappointed official ratifies his predecessor’s action and does \nso in accordance with the law, that ratification may ‘remedy \na  defect  arising  from  the  decision  of  an  improperly \nappointed’ predecessor.” (quoting Jooce v. FDA, 981 F.3d \n26, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2020))). \n2. The FVRA’s Ratification Bar\nBut not so fast.  The authority to ratify is not unlimited. \nOne limit on the ability to ratify the unauthorized actions of \na purported Acting Secretary is the FVRA’s Ratification \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 18 of 64\n18 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nBar—the very crux of this case.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(2).  \nThe parties dispute the applicability of the Ratification Bar.  \nThe subsection that contains the Ratification Bar provides \nthat actions “taken by any person who is not acting under” \nthe FVRA “in the performance of any function or duty of a \nvacant office . . . shall have no force or effect” and “may not \nbe ratified.”  Id. § 3348(d) (emphasis added).  Unfortunately, \nthe district court failed to grapple with § 3348’s definition of \n“function or duty,” thus ignoring a key aspect of the statute \nbeing interpreted.  See id. § 3348(a)(2).  Because this Court \nhas never interpreted the Ratification Bar provision of the \nFVRA, we do so now and join the other circuit courts in \nholding that the Ratification Bar embodied in § 3348(d) \napplies  only  to  those  duties  of  an  officer  that  are \nnondelegable.  See Kajmowicz, 42 F.4th at 148; Arthrex, Inc. \nv. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 35 F.4th 1328, 1336 (Fed. Cir.\n2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 2493 (2023).\nWe  hold  that  promulgation  of  the  Rule  was  not  a \nnondelegable duty of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nSince promulgation of the Rule could have been delegated \nby the Secretary to another person, and was not an action \nwhich only the Secretary could take, the Ratification Bar \ndoes  not  invalidate  Secretary  Mayorkas’s  ratification  of \nWolf’s promulgation of the Rule. \nAs  always,  we  “begin  by  analyzing  the  statutory \nlanguage, ‘assum[ing] that the ordinary meaning of that \nlanguage  accurately  expresses  the  legislative  purpose.’” \nHardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 \n(2010) (alteration in original) (quoting Gross v. FBL Fin. \nServs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009)).  And where statutory \nlanguage is plain and unambiguous, it must be enforced \n“according to its terms.”  Id. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 19 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 19 \nIn prescribing the penalties for failure to comply with the \nFVRA, § 3348(d) provides: \n(1) An action taken by any person who is not\nacting under [the FVRA] in the performance of\nany function or duty of a vacant office to which\n[the FVRA applies] shall have no force or effect.\n(2) An action that has no force or effect under\nparagraph (1) may not be ratified.\nId. (emphasis added).  Notably, “function or duty” is a term \ndefined in the same statute: \n(a)In this section--\n. . .\n(2)the term “function or duty” means any function\nor duty of the applicable office that--\n(A)(i) is established by statute; and\n(ii)is required by statute to be performed by the\napplicable officer (and only that officer); or\n(B)(i)(I) is established by regulation; and\n(II) is  required  by  such  regulation  to  be\nperformed by the applicable officer (and only\nthat officer); and\n(ii) includes a function or duty to which clause\n(i)(I)  and  (II)  applies,  and  the  applicable\nregulation is in effect at any time during the 180-\nday  period  preceding  the  date  on  which  the\nvacancy occurs.\nId. § 3348(a) (emphasis added). \nThe plain and unambiguous language of § 3348(d)(1), \nand subsection (d)(2)’s Ratification Bar, applies only to “any \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 20 of 64\n20 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nfunction or duty of a vacant office.”  § 3348(d)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  As “function or duty” is defined within § 3348 as \none that is “required by statute to be performed by the \napplicable officer (and only that officer),” the plain language \nof that definition is determinative.  See Stenberg v. Carhart, \n530 U.S. 914, 942 (2000) (“When a statute includes an \nexplicit definition, we must follow that definition . . . .”).  \nFurther, it is “a cardinal principle of statutory construction \nthat we must ‘“give effect, if possible, to every clause and \nword of a statute.”’”  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404 \n(2000) (quoting United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, \n538–39 (1955)); see ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER,\nREADING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 174–\n79 (2012) (discussing the surplusage canon). \nEquipped with these guiding principles, the plain and \nunambiguous  text  and  the  FVRA’s  structure  support  an \ninterpretation  of  “function  or  duty”  that  includes  a \nRatification Bar only to exclusive, or nondelegable, duties of \nthe Secretary.  We explain below why the promulgation of \nthe Rule is not a “function or duty” which a statute or \nregulation requires only the Secretary to perform, but a duty \nwhich  the  Secretary  can  lawfully  delegate.    Thus,  the \nRatification Bar does not apply here. \na. Text\nA “function or duty” under § 3348 must be exclusive to \nthe  officer,  or  nondelegable,  based  on  the  plain  and \nunambiguous meaning of the parenthetical modifier “and \nonly that officer.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(2).  Though Plaintiffs \ncorrectly note that the word nondelegable “appears nowhere \nin the statute,” to assign the parenthetical modifier any other \ninterpretation would strain the plain meaning of the phrase \n“and only that officer.”  In 1998, when the FVRA was \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 21 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 21 \npassed, the pertinent definition of the adverb “only” meant \nwhat  it  means  today:  “solely,  exclusively.”    MERRIAM-\nWEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 812 (10th ed. 1998). \nThe plain meaning of “only that officer” means the “function \nor duty” must be entrusted to and performed exclusively by \nthat officer and no one other than that officer.  It does not, \nas the dissent suggests, merely “exclude[] instances in which \nCongress has directed more than one officer to perform a \nfunction or duty,” each by himself or together with another \nofficer.  Diss. Op. 51–52.  If a statute required a duty to be \nperformed  by  “the  Secretary  and/or  anyone  of  the \nSecretary’s  choosing,”  despite  no  other  officer  being \nassigned that duty, surely that duty would not constitute a \n“function or duty” under § 3348(a)(2), because that duty \nwould not be “required by statute” to be performed by “only \nthat  officer.”    See  5  U.S.C.  § 3348(a)(2)(A)(ii).    The \ndissent’s interpretation would negate the plain meaning of \nthe parenthetical “and only that officer.” \nThe plain meaning of the parenthetical “and only that \nofficer” is further clarified by the definition’s introductory \nlanguage.  The definition of “function or duty” refers to “the \napplicable office” and then “the applicable officer,” but the \nparenthetical “only that officer” refers to the officer, not the \noffice.  Id. § 3348(a)(2).  By “officer” Congress means “an \nindividual  who  is . . .  engaged  in  the  performance  of  a \nFederal function under authority of law or an Executive act.” \nId. § 2104(a)(2).  By “office” Congress means a particular \nset  of  functions  or  duties  established  by  law.    See  id. \n§2104(a)(3) (an officer is “subject to the supervision of an\nauthority . . . while engaged in the performance of the duties\nof his office”).  Functions and duties are established, or\nvested, in an office. See id. § 3348(a)(2)(A)(i).  They are\nperformed, and with proper authority may be delegated, by\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 22 of 64\n22 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V.

Thus, the “only that \nofficer” parenthetical applies to who performs or delegates \nthe  function  or  duty  (the  officer)  instead  of  where  the \nfunction  or  duty  is  established  or  vested  (the  office). \nCongress chose to define “function or duty” in terms of \nwhich specific officer is required to perform that duty.  That \nchoice  supports  an  interpretation  that  incorporates  a \nrequirement of nondelegation for the Ratification Bar to \napply. \nAn interpretation of “function or duty” narrower than \nthat  proposed  by  the  dissent,  and  in  keeping  with  this \nopinion, has been endorsed by every other circuit to decide \nthe issue, and for sound reasons.  See Kajmowicz, 42 F.4th \nat 148; Arthrex, 35 F.4th at 1336 (“This statutory language \n[of  § 3348]  is  unambiguous:  the  FVRA  applies  only  to \nfunctions and duties that a [Presidentially appointed and \nSenate-confirmed] officer alone is permitted by statute or \nregulation  to  perform.    It  does  not  apply  to  delegable \nfunctions and duties.”). \nIn  Kajmowicz,  the  Third  Circuit  affirmed  a  district \ncourt’s dismissal of a suit challenging the promulgation of a \nrule by a purported “Acting Attorney General.”  Kajmowicz, \n42 F.4th at 144.  The court held that Attorney General \nWilliam Barr’s later ratification of the rule was not barred by \nthe FVRA and foreclosed Kajmowicz’s challenge.  Id. at \n144, 154.  The court wrote that the statutory language was \nunambiguous and that the definition of “function or duty” \ndoes not include delegable functions and duties.  Id. at 148–\n49. The court was unpersuaded by the fact that § 3348 does\nnot  contain  the  words  “nondelegable”  or  “exclusive”\nbecause “Congress need not have included these terms when\nit already included the parenthetical qualifier ‘and only that\nofficer.’”  Id. at 148 (quoting § 3348(a)(2)(A)(ii)).  The court\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 23 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 23 \nalso explicitly rejected the argument that “if a statute assigns \na duty to a single office rather than multiple offices, then it \ndoes  so  exclusively.”    Id.  at  149.    Referencing  the \npresumption  that  delegation  is  “permissible  absent \naffirmative evidence of a contrary congressional intent,” the \ncourt  gave  “effect  to  Congress’s  decision  to  define  a \n‘function or duty’ in terms of what the statute requires, not \nwhat it permits.”  Id. at 149–50 (quoting La. Forestry Ass’n \nv. Sec’y U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 745 F.3d 653, 671 (3d Cir.\n2014)).  Applying this interpretation, and acknowledging\nthat  “most  statutes  that  confer  authority  will  permit\nsubdelegation,”  and  thus  permit  ratification  under  the\nFVRA,4 the court determined that Attorney General Barr’s\nratification of the promulgated rule was not prohibited by the\nFVRA and cured any defects.  Id. at 151–52.\nHere, applying the plain text of the statute, the relevant \nquestion  is  whether  promulgation  of  immigration  surety \nbond rules was a “function or duty” “established by statute” \nand “required by statute to be performed by” the Secretary \nof Homeland Security (and only the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity).  See 5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(2)(A).  Under 8 U.S.C. \n4  Judge  Fisher’s  concurring  opinion  in  Kajmowicz  articulated  an \nadditional requirement to conclude an action is not a “function or duty” \nunder § 3348: that the authority for that action not just be delegable but \nhave been previously delegated.  Kajmowicz, 42 F.4th at 154.  This idea \nrests on the misconception that if the officer “has not actually delegated \nthe authority to undertake a particular action, the statutory authority \nrequires the action to be performed by only the [officer].”  Id.  As the \nmajority opinion in Kajmowicz explained, § 3348(a)(2) is framed in \nterms of what a statute requires, not what it permits.  Id. at 150.  The \nabsence of an officer exercising his authority to delegate a duty has no \neffect on whether a duty is “required by statute to be performed by the \napplicable  officer  (and  only  that  officer).”    See  5  U.S.C. \n§3348(a)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 24 of 64\n24 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

HTH Corp., 650 F.3d 1334, 1350 (9th\nCir. 2011) (alteration in original) (quoting Loma Linda Univ.\nv.Schweiker, 705 F.2d 1123, 1128 (9th Cir. 1983)).  We are\nnot aware of any law that limits the Secretary’s ability to\ndelegate promulgation of immigration surety bond rules.\nBecause no statute required the Secretary, and only the\nSecretary,  to  promulgate  immigration  surety  bond  rules,\npromulgation of the Rule was delegable—and therefore not\na “function or duty” within the meaning of § 3348.  Hence,\nratification of the Rule Wolf promulgated was not barred by\nthe FVRA.\nb. Structure\nA textual interpretation of the statute that incorporates \nthe “nondelegable” requirement as a necessary element to \nbar ratification is supported by the structure of the FVRA \nand will not, as Plaintiffs insist, “eviscerate the FVRA’s \nremedial scheme.”  Nor does a textual reading require us to \nview  this  provision  in  isolation  or  disrupt  the  statute’s \nstructure. \nTo begin, our interpretation of “function or duty” will not \nallow agencies to skirt the FVRA’s requirements.  Amicus \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 25 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 25 \nConstitutional Accountability Center (“Center”) posits that \na requirement of nondelegation to invoke the Ratification \nBar would allow agencies to “rely on their vesting-and-\ndelegation authority to circumvent [the FVRA], knowing \nthat their unlawful actions could not be held void under \n§3348(d)(1) and, if necessary, could be ratified.”  Not so.\nFirst, actions of officers who are exempt from § 3348,5\nincluding its Ratification Bar, can still be found without legal\nforce based on other provisions of the FVRA.  See SW Gen.,\n580  U.S.  at  298–305,  309  (affirming  the  lower  court’s\ndecision to vacate an NLRB order where the officer served\nin violation of § 3345, even though his office was exempt\nfrom § 3348, including the Ratification Bar).  Second, the\nFVRA is not the only limit on agency action, and a court\ncould “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” taken by\nsomeone without authority to act on behalf of the agency as\n“not  in  accordance  with  law . . .  [or]  in  excess  of\nstatutory . . . authority.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Third,\nsubsequent ratification of an action taken by an improperly\nappointed  Acting  Secretary  is  not  inevitable.    The\nsubsequent  Secretary  would  have  to  exercise  his  lawful\nauthority  to  ratify  the  action,  an  action  he  could  take\nindependently  in  his  capacity  as  Secretary,  and  only  if\nCongress had not made that earlier action nondelegable.\nThus, agencies hypothetically could rely on their vesting-\nand-delegation authority, even if knowingly violating the\nFVRA,  but  that  would  neither  make  their  actions\nimmediately lawful nor ensure their ratification.\n5 Section 3348(e) provides a list of officers to whom that section, \nincluding  the  Ratification  Bar,  does  not  apply.    The  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security is not among those officers. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 26 of 64\n26 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nAs we have explained, not “every violation of the FVRA \nwill  result  in  the  invalidation  of  the  challenged  agency \naction.”  Hooks v. Kitsap Tenant Support Servs., Inc., 816 \nF.3d  550,  564  (9th  Cir.  2016)  (dismissing  the  NLRB’s\npetition “for lack of proper authorization” by Acting General\nCounsel, even though he was exempt from § 3348).  And yet,\neven where functions and duties performed in violation of\nthe FVRA fall outside of the scope of § 3348, those actions\nare “voidable, not void.”  Id. (quoting SW Gen., Inc. v.\nNLRB, 796 F.3d 67, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  “Voidable” means\nthe action may be challenged, but that the agency may raise\n“defenses based on harmless error or the de facto officer\ndoctrine . . .  to  overcome  the  consequences  of  particular\nFVRA violations.”  Id.  Or, as in this case, the agency may\nraise a ratification defense.  See Gordon, 819 F.3d at 1191–\n92. Violations  of  the  FVRA  that  are  not  void  under\n§3348(d)  remain  voidable  on  other  grounds,  subject  to\napplicable defenses.  See, e.g., L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F.\nSupp. 3d 1, 35 (D.D.C. 2020) (rejecting prejudicial error and\nde  facto  officer  defenses  to  invalidation).    Properly\nconstrued in this context, our interpretation of § 3348, which\nlimits  the  Ratification Bar’s  application  to  nondelegable\nduties, does not leave the FVRA toothless.\nFurther, interpreting the parenthetical modifier “and only \nthat officer” to denote duties exclusive to that officer is \nconsistent  with  a  similar  use  of  the  same  parenthetical \nmodifier  in  § 3345(a).    That  section  provides  that  “the \nPresident  (and  only  the  President)  may  direct”  eligible \npeople  to  serve  as  acting  officers.    See  5  U.S.C. \n§3345(a)(2)–(3).  Though § 3345 is framed in terms of what\nthe President “may” do, and § 3348 in terms of what a statute\nor regulation “require[s],” in both instances the modifier\n“only” emphasizes the singularity or exclusivity of the action\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 27 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 27 \nto the person discussed, be it “only the President” or “only \nthat officer.”  See Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 568 \n(1995) (“[W]e adopt the premise that the term should be \nconstrued,  if  possible,  to  give  it  a  consistent  meaning \nthroughout the Act.  That principle follows from our duty to \nconstrue  statutes,  not  isolated  provisions.”);  SCALIA  &\nGARNER, supra, 170–73 (“The presumption of consistent \nusage applies also when different sections of an act or code \nare at issue.”). \nMoreover,  applying  the  plain  meaning  of  “only  that \nofficer,” which narrows the scope of the Ratification Bar, \nwill  not  render  subsection  (e)  of  § 3348  superfluous.  \nSubsection (e) lists officers who are exempt from § 3348, \nincluding its Ratification Bar.  But Congress’s choice not to \nexempt an officer from § 3348 while also narrowly defining \nwhich  “functions  and  duties”  are  unratifiable  is  not \nirrational, even if Plaintiffs thought the distinction more \nsignificant.    After  all,  the  Ratification  Bar  is  a  severe \nrestriction.  Similarly, whether an action is a “function or \nduty” under § 3348, the only section this definition applies \nto, is a question a court need not address if the officer is listed \nin § 3348(e).  An officer’s absence from § 3348(e), however, \ndoes not mean that any action taken in violation of the FVRA \nis necessarily subject to § 3348(d).  The inquiry whether an \naction  constitutes  a  “function  or  duty”  under  § 3348  is \ndistinct,  meaning  our  interpretation  in  no  way  renders \n§3348(e) surplusage.\nNext, interpreting “function or duty” in § 3348 to include\nonly nondelegable duties does not alter § 3347(b)’s dictate \nregarding  general  vesting-and-delegation  statutes.  \nSubsection 3347(a)(1)  provides  that  the  FVRA  is  the \nexclusive means for appointing Acting officials “unless a \nstatutory  provision  expressly  authorizes  the  President,  a \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 28 of 64\n28 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \ncourt, or the head of an Executive department” to designate \nthe acting officer, or a separate statute designates the acting \nofficer.  Section 3347(b) provides, “Any statutory provision \nproviding general authority to the head of an Executive \nagency . . .  to  delegate  duties  statutorily  vested  in  that \nagency head to, or to reassign duties among, officers or \nemployees  of  such  Executive  agency,  is  not  a  statutory \nprovision to which subsection (a)(1) applies.”  Therefore, \n§3347(b)  clarifies  that  general  vesting-and-delegation\nstatutes are not sufficient to authorize the department to\nchoose the acting officer under the FVRA, but this does not\nimpact the meaning of “function or duty” in § 3348.6  See\nArthrex, 35 F.4th at 1338.  That a department head cannot\nrely on a general vesting-and-delegation statute to designate\nthe acting officer in the event of a vacancy,  § 3347(b),\nanswers a question wholly distinct from the consequences of\nviolations of the FVRA under § 3348.7  Our interpretation\n6 The distinction between § 3347 and § 3348 is further supported by the \nphrase “In this section,” which introduces the definition of “function or \nduty” in § 3348(a)(2).  As we have recognized, “‘[t]hroughout the \nFVRA, the Congress was precise in its use of internal cross-references,’ \nusing the term ‘subsection’ or ‘paragraph’ when it meant to refer to \nsomething less than a whole section.”  Hooks, 816 F.3d at 559 (alteration \nin original) (quoting SW Gen., 796 F.3d at 74 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  Though \n§3347 provides context as to the FVRA’s structure, it is less instructive\nthan the dissent posits for interpreting the definition of “function or duty” \napplicable in § 3348, the section to which the definition applies.\n7 In fact, § 3347(b) addresses a specific past practice of the executive \nbranch.  Until Congress enacted the FVRA, the Department of Justice \nmaintained  that  its  general  “vesting-and-delegation  authority . . . \npermit[ted] the Attorney General to reassign the duties of such Senate-\nconfirmed positions to other officials of the Department, outside the \nlimits of the Vacancies Act.”  The Vacancies Act, 22 Op. O.L.C. 44, 45 \n(1998).  The general delegation exclusion in § 3347(b) addresses this \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 29 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 29 \ndoes not “place[] §§ 3347(b) and 3348(d) at odds.”  Diss. \nOp. 55.  Rather, it recognizes that who is authorized to act \nand the various consequences of an unauthorized person’s \nactions are not necessarily congruent, and that Congress was \naware of this when it drafted the FVRA.8 \nLastly, the Center incorrectly argues that “[m]any duties \nthat are established by regulation are delegations,” so the \ndefinition of “function or duty” under § 3348(a)(2)(A) must \ninclude  delegable  duties.    This  conclusion  is  wrong.  \nSection 3348(a)(2)(B)  uses  similar  language  as \n§3348(a)(2)(A) but defines “function or duty” in terms of\nthose “required by . . . regulation to be performed by the\napplicable  officer  (and  only  that  officer).”    5  U.S.C.\n§3348(a)(2)(B)(i)(II)  (emphasis  added).    What  logically\nfollows from the structure of § 3348(a)(2) is that even if a\nstatute does not make a duty nondelegable, an agency can tie\nits own hands by doing so in a regulation.  See Stand Up for\nCal.! v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 994 F.3d 616, 622 (D.C.\nCir. 2021) (“Appellants do not argue that any statute vests\nexclusive  authority  with  the  Secretary  or  the  [Assistant\nSecretary], and we are unaware of any such statute.

Diss. Op. \n52, 57.  Though the dissent argues that “[w]hether other statutes [such as \nthe APA] may provide means of redress” to enforce the FVRA “says \nnothing about the correct interpretation of the FVRA,” we disagree. \nDiss.

AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \ntherefore  determine  whether  the  Department  itself  has \ncabined this authority.”).  The Center reasons that if some \nduties established by regulation are “functions and duties” \nunder § 3348, and “many” duties established by regulation \nare delegations, then some “functions and duties” under \n§3348(a)(2)(A) must be delegable.  But this is a faulty\nsyllogism, as an action that is delegable under the statutory\nscheme,  and  therefore  not  a  “function  or  duty”  under\n§3348(a)(2)(A), could be made nondelegable by regulation,\nand  satisfy  and  give  independent  meaning  to\n§3348(a)(2)(B).    The  practice  of  delegating  duties  by\nregulation  does  not  justify  interpreting  “and  only  that\nofficer” out of the statute Congress enacted.\nIf  a  statute’s  provision  “has  a  plain  meaning  or  is \nunambiguous,  the  statutory  interpretation  inquiry  ends \nthere.”  CVS Health Corp. v. Vividus, LLC, 878 F.3d 703, \n706 (9th Cir. 2017).  Plaintiffs and the Center rely on SW \nGeneral  and  the  Supreme  Court’s  explanation  of  the \nFVRA’s  development  and  statutory  scheme  for  the \nproposition that, because Congress passed the FVRA in \nresponse  to  a  perceived  threat  to  the  Senate’s  power, \n§3348’s  enforcement  mechanism  must  have  broad\napplicability.  See SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 293–96.  To be sure,\nthe Court in SW General said that “[t]he FVRA ensures\ncompliance by providing that, in general, ‘any function or\nduty of a vacant office’ performed by a person not properly\nserving under the statute ‘shall have no force or effect.’”  SW\nGen., 580 U.S. at 296 (quoting § 3348(d)).  But the Court did\nnot  go  on  to  interpret  “function  or  duty”  under  § 3348\nbecause the Court’s analysis focused on § 3345 in holding\nthat § 3345(b)(1) applies not only to first assistants who\nassume  their  acting  duties  under  § 3345(a)(1),  but  to\n“anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.”  See\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 31 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 31 \nid. at 299–308.  Thus, the Court’s explanation of § 3348(d)’s \nenforcement  mechanism  in  general  does  not  require  the \nbroader interpretation of “function or duty” Plaintiffs seek. \nEven had the Court in SW General reached the issue of \ninterpreting  “function  or  duty”  under  § 3348,  the \ninterpretation would not have been determinative because \nthe officer at issue was the General Counsel of the NLRB, \nwho is exempt from § 3348.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3348(e); SW \nGen., 580 U.S. at 297–98.  And the Court’s affirmance of the \nlower court’s decision to vacate an NLRB order because the \nGeneral Counsel served in violation of § 3345(b)(1) further \nillustrates how our interpretation of § 3348 does not leave \nthe FVRA without force.9  See SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 297–\n99, 309. \nLastly, even assuming various department heads can \ndelegate virtually all of their functions or duties, this does \nnot change Congress’s authority under the current statutory \nscheme to alter the scope of those delegations, as it has done \nbefore.  See 6 U.S.C. § 624(c)(2) (“The Secretary may not \ndelegate the authority under paragraph (1) [regarding certain \nemergency orders] to any official other than the Director of \nthe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.”); 31 \nU.S.C.  § 1344(d)(3)  (“The  authority  to  make \n9 We recognize the Supreme Court did not reach the issue whether \n§3348(e)(1) renders the actions of an improperly serving Acting NLRB\nGeneral Counsel voidable because the NLRB did not seek certiorari on\nthat issue.

Circuit’s decision vacating an NLRB order because\nthe  acting  general  counsel  of  the  NLRB  violated  § 3345(b)(1)  by\ncontinuing to serve in that role after being nominated to fill the position\nin a permanent capacity.  Id. at 309.  Thus, the Acting General Counsel’s\norder was vacated for violating the FVRA without reliance on § 3348.\nOur interpretation in no way misreads SW General.  See Diss. Op. 57.\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 32 of 64\n32 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V.

To be sure, the Secretary’s authority to delegate \nunder 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(1) is broad, and other department \nheads have similarly broad authority to delegate.  See L.M.-\nM., 442 F. Supp. 3d at 31 n.11 (listing other cabinet-level \ndepartments  with  similar  vesting-and-delegation  statutes, \nincluding the Departments of Defense, Education, State, \nJustice,  Treasury,  Veterans  Affairs,  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Commerce, \nLabor, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services).  But \nconcerns regarding the current ability of department heads \nto delegate authority do not sound in statutory interpretation; \nrather,  they  are  concerns  of  “undesirable  policy \nconsequences.”  Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 680 \n(2020).    We  cannot  concern  ourselves  with  policy \nconsequences.    “The  place  to  make  new  legislation,  or \naddress unwanted consequences of old legislation, lies in \nCongress.”  Id. at 680–81. \nRegardless, our interpretation does not leave the FVRA \nwithout force.  Instead, our interpretation complies with the \ntext of the statute Congress crafted to limit the scope of one \nof the statute’s most severe restrictions.  Because the plain \ntext of the FVRA unambiguously requires an interpretation \nof  “function  or  duty”  encompassing  only  nondelegable \nduties, and promulgation of the contested Rule was a task \ndelegable by the Secretary, the FVRA did not bar Secretary \nMayorkas’s ratification of the Rule. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 33 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 33 \nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the district\ncourt’s order, which granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgment and which vacated the Rule, and we remand for \nfurther proceedings. \nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\nJohnstone, J., concurring: \nWhen a purported acting officer serves in violation of the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an action taken by \nthat officer in the performance of “any function or duty” of \nthe vacant office may be challenged. 5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(2). \nSubsection  3348(d)(2)  provides  one  especially  potent \nremedy: it voids, and prohibits ratification of, the action. But \nCongress limited the application of this ratification bar to the \nperformance of a “function or duty” that “is required . . . to \nbe  performed  by  the  applicable  officer  (and  only  that \nofficer).” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i)(II). \nI agree with the lead opinion’s analysis of the FVRA’s \ntext  and  structure.  But  our  analysis  cannot  stop  there \nbecause, even after considering text and structure, the phrase \n“the applicable officer (and only that officer)” is ambiguous. \nSo we must look to extrinsic evidence from our co-equal \nbranches to determine its meaning. The best evidence of the \nFVRA’s history and practice resolves this ambiguity: the \ndefined  “function  or  duty”  includes  only  the  officer’s \nnondelegable  duties.  Therefore,  § 3348(d)(2)  did  not \nprohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security’s ratification of \nthe surety bonds rule. Accordingly, except for its conclusion \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 34 of 64\n34 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nthat the meaning of the statute is plain, I concur in the lead \nopinion. \nI. The  FVRA’s  definition  of  “function  or  duty”  is\nambiguous.\nTo determine the scope of the ratification bar we must\nask: what is a function or duty “required by statute to be \nperformed by the applicable officer (and only that officer)”? \n5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(2)(A)(ii). One answer: a function or duty \n“is required . . . to be performed by the applicable officer \n(and  only  that  officer)”  when  it  cannot  be  delegated  to \nanyone else. Few functions and duties of federal offices are \nnondelegable, so this reading gives a narrow scope to the \nactions subject to § 3348(d). The lead opinion concludes that \nthe  FVRA’s  text  unambiguously  requires  this  narrower \ninterpretation. At least two other courts agree. Kajmowicz v. \nWhitaker, 42 F.4th 138, 148–50 (3d Cir. 2022); Arthrex, Inc. \nv. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 35 F.4th 1328, 1335–38 (Fed. Cir.\n2022).\nOther courts that find the same language unambiguous, \nhowever, come up with a different answer: a function or duty \n“is required . . . to be performed by the applicable officer \n(and only that officer)” when only a single officer is vested \nwith the function or duty. Asylumworks v. Mayorkas, 590 F. \nSupp. 3d 11, 22–25 (D.D.C. 2022); Behring Reg’l Ctr. v. \nWolf, 544 F. Supp. 3d 937, 945–47 (N.D. Cal. 2021). Most \nfunctions and duties of federal offices are vested in single \nofficers, so this reading gives a broad scope to the actions \nsubject to § 3348(d). The dissent concludes that the FVRA’s \npurpose requires this broader interpretation. \nWhether this language is ambiguous matters because \nwhen the text is clear, we do not look to outside evidence to \ninterpret it. See NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., 580 U.S. 288, 305 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 35 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 35 \n(2017); United States ex rel. Hartpence v. Kinetic Concepts, \nInc., 792 F.3d 1121, 1128 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc). But \nwhether a statute is ambiguous can be a difficult question. \nReasonable people, including judges, often disagree about a \ntext’s ambiguity. See Ward Farnsworth et al., Ambiguity \nAbout  Ambiguity:  An  Empirical  Inquiry  into  Legal \nInterpretation, 2 J. Legal Analysis 257, 276 (2010); see also \nBrett M. Kavanaugh, Fixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 \nHarv. L. Rev. 2118, 2134–44 (2016) (reviewing Robert A. \nKatzmann, Judging Statutes (2014)). “[T]here is no errorless \ntest for identifying or recognizing ‘plain’ or ‘unambiguous’ \nlanguage.” United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580 \n(1981). \nWherever the line between plain meaning and ambiguity \nlies,  in  my  view  the  text  at  issue  falls  on  the  side  of \nambiguity. The linguistic meaning of the phrase “and only \nthat  officer”  does  not  resolve  that  proposition’s  legal \nmeaning in the context of the FVRA. Despite the invocation \nof competing definitions by the lead opinion and dissent, \ndictionaries fortify neither interpretation from doubt. Cf. \nCabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1945) (L. \nHand,  J.)  (warning  “not  to  make  a  fortress  out  of  the \ndictionary”), aff’d, 326 U.S. 404 (1945). And the phrase \n“and  only  that  officer”  appears  to  be  unprecedented  in \nfederal law, so there are no established usages to draw upon \nelsewhere in the United States Code. Cf. Antonin Scalia & \nBrian A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts  167–68  (2012)  (explaining  the  whole-text  canon). \nThose terms do not obviously describe nondelegable duties. \nCongress could have simply referred to delegation by name \nin  § 3348,  but  it  did  not.  Elsewhere,  Congress  used \ndelegation only to broaden, not narrow, the FVRA’s reach. \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 3347(b). It is no surprise that our fellow \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 36 of 64\n36 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nfederal courts have diverged in their interpretations of this \nstatute. So while I agree that the lead opinion’s narrower \nreading of the statute’s text and structure is more likely than \nthe alternative, it is not sufficiently clear to dismiss the \ndissent’s broader reading of the FVRA’s purpose.  \nII.Legislative history supports the narrower reading.\nWhen a statute’s meaning is not plain, we may consider\nits legislative history. See Silvers v. Sony Pictures Ent., Inc., \n402  F.3d  881,  885–86  (9th  Cir.  2005)  (en  banc);  e.g., \nDelaware v. Pennsylvania, 598 U.S. 115, 138–39 (2023) \n(relying in part on a Senate Report to construe the limiting \nparenthetical “(other than a third party bank check)” in 12 \nU.S.C.  § 2503).  When  we  use  legislative  history  to \nunderstand linguistic usage of words in a statute, rather than \nthe drafters’ intent or the law’s purpose, it is just as probative \nas any dictionary. See Scalia & Garner, supra, at 388. Thus, \nin our search for a statute’s meaning, legislative history may \n“supply[] a well-informed, contemporaneous account of the \nrelevant background to the enactment.” John F. Manning, \nTextualism as a Nondelegation Doctrine, 97 Colum. L. Rev. \n673,  732  (1997).  This  is  because  “[c]larity  depends  on \ncontext, which legislative history may illuminate,” bearing \nin mind that “the search is not for the contents of the authors’ \nheads but for the rules of language they used.” In re Sinclair, \n870 F.2d 1340, 1342 (7th Cir. 1989) (Easterbrook, J.). We \nalso  must  not  misuse  legislative  history  to  establish \noverriding  legislative  purposes  that  were  not  enacted  in \nstatutory text. “Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory \ninterpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on \nthe  enacting  Legislature’s  understanding  of  otherwise \nambiguous terms.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., \nInc., 545 U.S. 546, 568 (2005). \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 37 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 37 \nThe  FVRA’s  primary  legislative  history  is  a  Senate \nReport on an earlier version of the bill. See generally S. Rep. \nNo.  105-250  (1998)  (discussing  the  materially  identical \nFVRA bill later enacted as part of an omnibus appropriations \nact).  Committee  reports,  “which  presumably  are  well \nconsidered  and  carefully  prepared,”  are  generally  more \nreliable  than  other  Congressional  materials  that  trouble \nskeptics of legislative history. Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert \nCorp., 341 U.S. 384, 395 (1951) (Jackson, J., concurring) \n(“Resort to legislative history is only justified where the face \nof the Act is inescapably ambiguous, and then I think we \nshould  not  go  beyond  Committee  reports.”).  And  while \n“legislative history is itself often murky, ambiguous, and \ncontradictory,” Exxon Mobil Corp., 545 U.S. at 568, this \nSenate Report speaks clearly and consistently to § 3348 and \nthe text at issue. \nThe FVRA’s legislative history is particularly probative \nof its meaning because members of Congress are more than \nthe authors of the statute; in the case of the Senate they are \nalso a central audience for it. This confluence narrows any \ngap between linguistic conventions of the regulators and the \nregulated, lessening any potential notice concerns. See Amy \nConey Barrett, Congressional Insiders and Outsiders, 84 U. \nChi. L. Rev. 2193, 2202 (2017). Especially where the text is \ntechnical  and  arises  from  a  lengthy  course  of  dealing \nbetween the branches, evidence of legislative usage may be \na more reliable guide to the words Congress chose than \ndueling dictionary definitions. See Abbe R. Gluck & Lisa \nSchultz  Bressman,  Statutory  Interpretation  from  the \nInside—An  Empirical  Study  of  Congressional  Drafting, \nDelegation, and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, \n939 (2013) (Congressional drafters “emphasized the utility \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 38 of 64\n38 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nof legislative history far more than dictionaries in resolving \nstatutory ambiguities”).  \nThe  Senate  Report’s  discussion  of  § 3348  maps  the \nconcept of nondelegable duties onto the phrase “function or \nduty required to be performed by the applicable officer (and \nonly  that  officer),”  and  therefore  supports  the  narrower \nreading. It shows that the FVRA’s remedy applies only to \nfunctions and duties the law requires “only that officer” to \nperform, meaning they are nondelegable to other officers. \nWhile the dissent is correct that the term “nondelegable” \ndoes not appear in the statute, it appears throughout the \nSenate  Report’s  discussion  of  the  functions  and  duties \ndefined in § 3348. This statutory definition of “function or \nduty”  discussed  in  the  report  applies  equally  to  all \nsubsections “[i]n this section,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(a), including \nthe ratification bar of § 3348(d)(2). \nThe report summarizes the “function or duty” definition \nat issue “as those functions or duties that . . . are established \nby statute and are required to be performed only by the \napplicable officer.” S.  Rep. No. 105-250, at 17. It then \ndiscusses this definition in the context of the subsection \nproviding that only the head of the agency in which the \nvacant office occurs “may perform any function or duty of \nsuch office.” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(2). The report explains that \nthe “function or duty” defined in § 3348(a) refers to “the \nnon-delegable functions or duties of the officer . . . .” S. Rep. \nNo. 105-250, at 18; see also id. (“Delegable functions of the \noffice  could  still  be  performed  by  other  officers  or \nemployees, but the functions and duties to be performed only \nby the [Presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed (“PAS”)] \nofficer . . . could be performed solely by the head of the \nexecutive  agency.”).  According  to  the  Senate  Report, \ntherefore, the phrase “functions or duties” of an office means \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 39 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 39 \nnondelegable duties of the office, which the drafters then \ndescribed as “required . . . to be performed by the applicable \nofficer (and only that officer).” Id. at 27 (text of § 3348(a)).  \nThis  definition  of  functions  or  duties  was  also \nconsistently  used  by  Senators  providing  additional  or \ndissenting views. A group of five Senators worried about “an \nunintended shutdown of the Federal agency within which the \nvacancy  exists  due  to  administrative  paralysis,”  and \nrequested that the legislation clarify “that the non-delegable \nduties we intend to have performed only by the agency head \nare  only  those  expressly  vested  by  law  or  regulation \nexclusively in the vacant position.” Id. at 31 (views of Sens. \nGlenn, Levin, Lieberman, Cleland, & Torricelli). And the \nminority urged: “It is imperative that the bill unequivocally \nensure that the affected functions and duties of the office are \nonly those that are expressly deemed nondelegable by statute \nor regulation.” Id. at 36 (minority views of Sens. Durbin & \nAkaka).1 \nTaken as evidence of linguistic usage, the legislative \nhistory of the FVRA shows that the Senators who supported \nthe  bill  used  “and  only  that  officer”  to  express  the \n1 The Committee reported the bill by a vote of 9-1, with Senators \nCleland, Glenn, Levin, and Lieberman joining the majority in voting \nYea. Senator Durbin was the only member voting Nay. S. Rep. No. 105-\n250, at 11. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the original version of \nthe Act by a vote of 53-38, with Senators Akaka, Cleland, Durbin, Glenn, \nLevin, and Lieberman voting Nay after several of them objected to their \ninability to make amendments unrelated to the nondelegable duty issue. \n105 Cong. Rec. 22526 (1998). A month later a Conference Committee \nreported the Act in an omnibus appropriations bill. H.R. Rep. 108-825, \nat 633–38 (1998). The House agreed to the conference report by a vote \nof 333-95, and the Senate agreed to it by a vote of 65-29. 105 Cong. Rec. \n22347–48, 27483 (1998). \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 40 of 64\n40 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nnondelegable function or duty meaning that we apply today. \nThe  Senators  who  expressed  concerns  about  the  FVRA \nagreed, but worried that the text did not express that reading \nunambiguously, an observation the dissent and I share.  \nThe plaintiffs and amicus the Center for Constitutional \nAccountability  make  general  claims  about  the  FVRA’s \npurpose, rooted in part in the Senate Report’s summary of \nthe bill, to support their broader reading of § 3348. Yet \nassertions that the purpose of the FVRA is to limit the \nPresident’s power under the Appointments Clause do not \nprove how, exactly, its text does so. Legislative history is \nmost reliable to prove what statutory text may mean, not \nwhat the statute should do. The dissent discerns a similar \nlegislative intent in the report’s criticism of Doolin Sec. Sav. \nBank, F.S.B. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 139 F.3d 203 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998). But we cannot “give[] authoritative weight \nto a single passage of legislative history that is in no way \nanchored in the text of the statute.” Shannon v. United States, \n512 U.S. 573, 583 (1994). Unlike these general discussions \nof the purposes or other provisions of the FVRA, the Senate \nReport’s  section-by-section  analysis  of  the  § 3348(a)(2) \ndefinition of “function or duty” specifically refers to it as \n“the non-delegable functions or duties of the officer.” S. \nRep. No. 105-250, at 18. Nowhere does the Senate Report \nuse the definition of “function or duty” to mean what the \nplaintiffs, amicus, and dissent interpret it to say: vested by \nstatute in a single officer and not multiple officers. \nIII. Legislative  and  executive  practice  supports  the\nnarrower reading.\nA quarter-century of practice under the FVRA by both \nCongress  and  the  Administration  confirms  the  narrower \nreading. As James Madison observed: “All new laws, though \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 41 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 41 \npenned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the \nfullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more \nor  less  obscure  and  equivocal,  until  their  meaning  be \nliquidated  and  ascertained  by  a  series  of  particular \ndiscussions and adjudications.” The Federalist No. 37, at \n236 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). Thus, in \nseparation of powers disputes generally, and appointments \ndisputes specifically, we may look to the “liquidation” of \nambiguous terms through government practice. See NLRB v. \nNoel  Canning,  573  U.S.  513,  525  (2014);  see  also \nM’Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 401 (1819) (“[A] \ndoubtful question” of separation of powers, “if not put at rest \nby  the  practice  of  the  government,  ought  to  receive  a \nconsiderable  impression  from  that  practice.”);  SEC  v. \nJarkesy, 603 U.S. ___, 2024 WL 3187811, at *12 n.2 (June \n27, 2024) (“Practice may be probative when it reflects the \nsettled institutional understandings of the branches.”). We \nshould not overread post-enactment practice to interpret the \nFVRA when evidence is too sparse to represent the positions \nof the respective branches. SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 308. But as \nto the specific definition of “function or duty” in § 3348, \nboth branches have converged on the narrower reading.  \nCongress charged the Comptroller General of the United \nStates, the head of the Government Accountability Office in \nthe legislative branch, with monitoring executive branch \ncompliance  with  the  FVRA.  See  5  U.S.C.  § 3349;  see \nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 731–32 (1986) (holding \nthat the Comptroller General is an officer of the legislative \nbranch). That office is thus uniquely situated to interpret the \nstatute. Despite its position in the legislative branch it has \ngiven § 3348 the narrower reading. In a legal opinion for \nSenators, the General Counsel for the Comptroller General \nexplained  that  the  functions  and  duties  set  forth  in \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 42 of 64\n42 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

June 13,\n2008). “[T]he Vacancies Act[’s] focus is on specified duties\nand functions which under statutory or regulatory language\nmust be performed exclusively by the incumbent of the\noffice,” which “requires language that clearly signals duties\nor functions that cannot be delegated.” Id. at *11–12.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the executive branch agrees with \nthis  narrower  reading.  Still,  it  has  taken  the  position \ndeliberately  and  consistently.  Shortly  after  the  FVRA’s \nenactment,  the  Department  of  Justice  issued  an  opinion \nexplaining  that  “a  ‘function  or  duty’  is  defined  as  any \nfunction or duty of the PAS office that is required by statute \nor regulation to be performed exclusively by the holder of \nthat office.” Guidance on Application of Fed.

Thus,  “the  Act  permits  non-\nexclusive  responsibilities  to  be  delegated  to  other \nappropriate officers and employees in the agency.” Id. at 72. \nThe Department has maintained that view. See, e.g., Fed. \nVacancies  Reform  Act’s  Application  to  a  Vacancy  for \nWhich Prior Presidents Submitted Multiple Nominations, 46 \nOp. O.L.C. __, 2022 WL 16694120, at *6 (O.L.C.

Kitsap  Tenant \nSupport Servs., 816 F.3d 550, 564 (9th Cir. 2016), and no \nparty suggests a deference canon applies here. Still, the \nlegislative and executive branches’ thorough, reasoned, and \nconsistent  guidance  on  this  question  provides  additional \npersuasive evidence of the statute’s probable, if not plain, \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 43 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

The FVRA arose from disagreements \nbetween  our  co-equal  branches  about  the  scope  of  the \nPresident’s  power  to  fill  vacancies  without  the  Senate’s \nadvice and consent. So it is significant that, here, agencies in \neach  branch  agree  upon  the  same,  narrower  reading  of \n§3348. The dissent’s broader reading would unsettle this\nmutual understanding.\n* * *\nA leading commentator observes, “[f]or all the detail \ngiven to permissible types of acting officials, their tenures, \nand the severe consequences of violations, the Vacancies \nAct now appears to provide an easy workaround in many \ncases: delegate the tasks of the vacant office.” Anne Joseph \nO’Connell, Actings, 120 Colum. L. Rev. 613, 633 (2020). \n“[T]hese  delegation  practices  are  pervasive.”  Id.  at  633 \nn.105. The dissent is correct that under our reading the\nFVRA’s voidness and ratification provision does not apply\nto “the vast majority of actions taken by officials serving in\nviolation of the act.” But it is not our reading of the FVRA\nitself that does that limiting work.\nWe  have  recognized  that  Congress  can  authorize \ndelegations implicitly: “as far as delegation to subordinates \nis concerned, ‘[e]xpress statutory authority for delegation is \nnot required.’” Frankl v.

The plaintiffs do not meaningfully challenge \nthe delegability of the duties here. See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3) \n(vesting  forms  of  bond  in  the  Secretary);  6  U.S.C. \n§112(b)(1)  (authorizing  delegation  of  “any  of  the\nSecretary’s functions”). Nor do they question the broader\ndoctrine of implied delegation. And practically speaking, it\nis this presumption that duties are delegable that narrows the\nscope of the FVRA’s statutory remedy.\nThe cumulative evidence of the text, structure, history, \nand practice of the FVRA establishes that the “function or \nduty”  definition  of  § 3348(a)(2)  applies  only  to  the \nnondelegable functions or duties of the applicable office. \nTherefore, § 3348(d)(2) did not prohibit ratification of the \nsurety bonds rule. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 45 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

USDHS 45 \nChristen, J., dissenting: \nThis case requires us to decide when consequences result \nfor violations of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 \n(FVRA), the statute that limits the time temporary officials \nmay  serve  in  Executive  Branch  positions  that  require \npresidential appointment and Senate confirmation.   \nCongress  crafted  a  stiff  enforcement  mechanism  for \nviolations of the FVRA: actions taken by officials serving in \nviolation of the Act have no force or effect, and the Act bars \nlater  ratification  of  those  actions.    See  5 U.S.C. \n§3348(d)(1)–(2).  Unfortunately, today’s decision renders\nthe FVRA a near-dead letter because the court decides that\nthe FVRA does not apply to the vast majority of actions\ntaken by officials serving in violation of the Act.  The\nmajority  reaches  this  conclusion  by  reasoning  that  the\nFVRA’s integrated scheme applies only to those functions\nand duties that Congress expressly forbids an officer from\ndelegating to a subordinate.  In my view, this conclusion is\ninconsistent  with  the  text,  structure,  and  purpose  of  the\nFVRA, all of which make clear that the Act applies to\nfunctions and duties that Congress requires a single officer\nto perform and excludes functions and duties that Congress\nauthorizes more than one officer to perform.\nTurning to the subject appeal, I agree with the majority \nthat Chad Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) when he \npromulgated the surety bonds rule at the heart of the parties’ \ndispute.

U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. \n2. An  officer  of  the  United  States  is  an  official  who\n“exercis[es] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the\nUnited States.”  Freytag v. Comm’r, 501 U.S. 868, 881\n(1991) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976)).\nVacancies in Executive offices arise frequently, and the\nnomination and confirmation of a successor is rarely a swift\nprocess.  As a practical—and often politically expedient—\nworkaround, the Executive Branch frequently turns to the\nuse  of  temporary,  or  “acting,”  officers  to  fill  vacant\npositions.  The Legislative Branch has allowed this practice,\nbut it has also placed limits on it to ensure that reliance on\ntemporary officers does not usurp the Senate’s advice-and-\nconsent role.  See NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., 580 U.S. 288, 294–\n95 (2017).\nThe FVRA is Congress’s latest attempt to reign in the \nExecutive Branch’s use of acting officers.  The FVRA’s \npredecessor, the Vacancies Act, dated to 1868.  See Act of \nJuly 23, 1868, ch. 227, 15 Stat. 168.  The Vacancies Act \ninitially allowed temporary officers to serve for just 10 days \nin  most  circumstances,  a  grace  period  that  was  later \nlengthened to 30 days and then 120 days.  SW Gen., 580 U.S. \nat  294–95.    The  Vacancies  Act  did  not  impose  any \nconsequences for the Executive Branch failing to comply \nwith these limits, however.  See 15 Stat. 168.  For more than \na century, the Vacancies Act was understood to be the sole \nmeans of temporarily filling vacancies in Executive offices. \nSee Morton Rosenberg, Cong. Rsch. Serv., RL 98-892, The \nNew Vacancies Act: Congress Acts to Protect the Senate’s \nConfirmation Prerogative 2 (1998) (Rosenberg).   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 47 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 47 \nIn 1973, the Department of Justice took the position that \nthe Vacancies Act was just one way of filling vacancies.  Id. \nat 2–3; see also SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 294.  A second way, \naccording to DOJ, was for an agency head to delegate all her \nfunctions  and  duties  to  a  subordinate  officer  or  agency \nemployee before leaving office, pursuant to the agency’s \nvesting-and-delegation statute.  Rosenberg at 2–3.  Vesting-\nand-delegation statutes are general provisions that vest all \nfunctions  of  an  agency  in  the  agency  head  and  allow \ndelegation of those functions to subordinates.  For example, \nDHS’s vesting-and-delegation statute provides that “[a]ll \nfunctions of all officers, employees, and organizational units \nof  the  Department  are  vested  in  the  Secretary”  and  the \nSecretary “may delegate any of the Secretary’s functions to \nany  officer,  employee,  or  organizational  unit  of  the \nDepartment.”  6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(3), (b)(1).  Taken to the \nextreme, DOJ’s position could allow an office subject to \nSenate  confirmation  to  go  unfilled  indefinitely  while  a \nsubordinate officer or agency employee performs the duties \nof the vacant office. \nAs the Supreme Court explained in SW General, the \n“interbranch conflict . . . over the Vacancies Act” came to a \nhead in the late-1990s.  580 U.S. at 294–95.  In 1998, about \n20%  of  Executive  offices  requiring  Senate  confirmation \nwere filled by acting officials, “most of whom had served \nbeyond the 120–day limitation period” in the Vacancies Act. \nId. at 295 (quoting Rosenberg at 1).  “Perceiving a threat to \nthe  Senate’s  advice  and  consent  power,  Congress  . . . \nreplaced the Vacancies Act with the FVRA.”  Id. (citing \nRosenberg at 6).   \nThe FVRA spans 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345 to 3349.  Section \n3345 identifies who may serve in an acting capacity when a \nSenate-confirmed member of the Executive Branch dies, \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 48 of 64\n48 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS.

USDHS \nresigns,  or  is  otherwise  unable  to  perform  her  duties. \nPursuant to the Act, the default replacement is the officer’s \nfirst assistant, who “shall perform the functions and duties of \nthe office” in an acting capacity.  5 U.S.C § 3345(a)(1).  \nAlternatively,  Congress  provided  that  the President  may \ndirect another Senate-confirmed officer, or an officer or \nemployee who has served in their position for at least 90 \ndays during the year preceding the vacancy and has a rate of \npay of at least GS-15, to perform the functions and duties of \nthe vacant office in an acting capacity.  Id. § 3345(a)(2)–(3).  \nSection 3346 limits the period an acting officer appointed \npursuant to § 3345 may serve to 210 days from the date of \nthe vacancy.  Id. § 3346(a)(1).  The 210-day period restarts \nif the Senate rejects a nominee.  Id. § 3346(b)(1). \nSection 3347(a) confirms that §§ 3345 and 3346 “are the \nexclusive  means”  for  the  appointment  of  officers  to \ntemporarily fill positions that require Senate confirmation, \nunless Congress expressly enacts an alternative order of \nsuccession  for  a  given  office  or  expressly  gives  the \nPresident,  a  court,  or  a  department  head  the  power  to \ndesignate a different order of succession.  Id. § 3347(a)–\n(a)(1).  Of critical importance to this appeal, § 3347(b) states \nthat  the  alternative  order  of  succession  referred  to  in \n§3347(a)(1)  does  not  include  general  vesting-and-\ndelegation statutes.  Id. § 3347(b) (“Any statutory provision\nproviding general authority to the head of an Executive\nagency . . . to delegate duties statutorily vested in that agency\nhead to, or to reassign duties among, officers or employees\nof such Executive agency, is not a statutory provision to\nwhich [§ 3347(a)(1)] applies.” (emphasis added)).

USDHS 49 \ndelegation statutes offer another way for a subordinate to \nperform the duties of an agency head.  \nUnlike the Vacancies Act, § 3348 of the FVRA sets out \ntwo  consequences  for  the  Executive  Branch’s  failure  to \ncomply with §§ 3345, 3346, and 3347.  When an officer \nserves without valid acting authority, or continues to serve \nbeyond the time in which she has valid acting authority, \n§3348(d) unequivocally requires that any action taken by\nthat officer in the performance of any function or duty of that\noffice “shall have no force or effect.”  Id. § 3348(d)(1).\nSecond, the Act states that an action that has no force or\neffect  under  § 3348(d)(1)  “may  not  be  ratified.”    Id.\n§3348(d)(2).\nSection 3348(a)  goes  on  to  define  the  functions  and\nduties that are subject to the ratification bar: \n(2) the term “function or duty” means any function\nor duty of the applicable office that—\n(A)(i) is established by statute; and \n(ii) is required by statute to be performed by\nthe applicable officer (and only that officer);\n. . . . \nId. § 3348(a).1  Finally, § 3349 requires the head of each \nExecutive agency to report to the Comptroller General and \nto Congress all vacancies, acting officers, and nominees.  Id. \n§3349(a).\n1 I focus primarily on the ratification bar at § 3348(d)(2) because that is \nthe  dispositive  provision  in  this  case.    However,  the  majority’s \ninterpretation  of  “function  or  duty”  equally  limits  § 3348(d)(1)’s \nrequirement that actions taken in violation of the FVRA have “no force \nor effect,” i.e., they “are void ab initio.”  SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 298 n.2.   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 50 of 64\n50 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nAt issue in this case is a rule regulating immigration \nsurety  bonds  promulgated  in  2020  by  then-Acting  DHS \nSecretary Chad Wolf.  In 2021, Wolf’s successor, Senate-\nconfirmed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, issued a \ndirective purporting to ratify the surety bonds rule.  I agree \nwith the majority that Wolf was not properly appointed as \nActing DHS Secretary when he issued the surety bonds rule. \nThe dispositive question is whether the FVRA’s ratification \nbar rendered Mayorkas’s ratification of the rule ineffective.  \nThe answer to that question turns on whether issuing rules \nfor surety bonds is a “function or duty” of the DHS Secretary \nwithin the meaning of § 3348(a)(2) of the FVRA.   \nCongress  directed  the  DHS  Secretary  to  promulgate \nbond rules.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1), (3) (“The Secretary \nof Homeland Security . . . shall establish such regulations; \nprescribe such forms of bond, reports, entries, and other \npaper; issue such instructions; and perform such other acts \nas he deems necessary for carrying out his authority . . . .”).  \nCongress did not direct any other officer to perform this \nduty.  Because this duty was one that Congress required only \nthe DHS Secretary to perform, the 2020 surety bonds rule \nwas without force or effect and could not be ratified.  The \nmajority nevertheless concludes that Secretary Mayorkas \nsuccessfully  ratified the rule,  reasoning that the duty to \npromulgate surety bonds rules was not a “function or duty” \nof the DHS Secretary because the Secretary was free to \ndelegate virtually all his duties to subordinates.   \nII \nMy colleagues adopt a definition of “function or duty” \nthat turns what the Supreme Court has described as the Act’s \n“general rule” into an exception.  SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 298 \nn.2.    In  my  view,  the  majority’s  conclusion  cannot  be\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 51 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 51 \nsquared with the plainest reading of the statutory text, the \nstatutory design, or the Act’s purpose.  I would hold that the \nFVRA  bars  ratification  of  actions  taken  by  improperly \nserving acting officials in the performance of functions or \nduties that Congress required to be performed by that officer \nand not by more than one officer.   \nA \nAs a majority of this panel recognizes, the FVRA’s \ndefinition of “function or duty” is susceptible to at least two \npermissible readings.  The statute provides that functions \nand  duties  of  officers  requiring  Senate  confirmation  are \nthose that are “required by statute to be performed by the \napplicable  officer  (and  only  that  officer).” \n§3348(a)(2)(A)(ii).  The plainest reading of this text is that\nwhere Congress directs an officer to perform a duty, and\ndoes not also direct one or more other officers to perform it,\nCongress has required that officer—and only that officer—\nto perform the duty.  See Require, Black’s Law Dictionary\n(6th ed. 1990) (defining “[r]equire” as “[t]o direct, order,\ndemand, instruct, command, claim, compel, request, need,\nexact”).  Several federal district courts have adopted this\nreading.  See, e.g., Behring Reg’l Ctr. LLC v. Wolf, 544 F.\nSupp.  3d  937,  948  (N.D.  Cal.  2021);  Asylumworks  v.\nMayorkas, 590 F. Supp. 3d 11, 25 (D.D.C. 2022).\nUnder this interpretation of the Act, the parenthetical \n“(and  only  that  officer)”  excludes  instances  in  which \nCongress has directed more than one officer to perform a \nfunction or duty.  For example, 18 U.S.C. § 2332(d) provides \nthat  “[n]o  prosecution  for  [certain  crimes  against  U.S. \nnationals that occur outside the U.S.] shall be undertaken by \nthe  United  States  except  on  written  certification  of  the \nAttorney General or the highest ranking subordinate of the \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 52 of 64\n52 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nAttorney  General  with  responsibility  for  criminal \nprosecutions”  that  the  prosecution  meets  certain \nrequirements.    Because  this  statute  directs  either  the \nAttorney  General  or  her  highest-ranking  subordinate  to \nauthorize certain prosecutions, this duty is not required to be \nperformed by the Attorney General and only the Attorney \nGeneral, and it is therefore not a “function or duty” within \nthe meaning of the FVRA.   \nAnother  plausible  reading  of  the  “function  or  duty” \nprovision, at least when the text is considered in isolation, is \nthe one adopted by the majority and two of our sister circuits. \nSee Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 35 F.4th 1328, \n1336–38 (Fed. Cir. 2022); Kajmowicz v. Whitaker, 42 F.4th \n138, 148 (3d Cir. 2022).  Under this interpretation, the \nparenthetical “(and only that officer)” implicitly excludes \nstatutory functions and duties that an officer is permitted to \ndelegate to a subordinate, because if a duty is delegable, the \nstatute does not require only that officer to perform it.  To \nappreciate the breadth of the hole this interpretation blasts \nthrough the FVRA, it is important to understand that there \nare several ways for Executive officers to delegate their \nstatutory duties to subordinates.   \nFirst, a specific duty may be made expressly delegable \nby statute.  Alternatively, general vesting-and-delegation \nstatutes allow agency heads to delegate any of their duties, \nso long as another statutory provision does not forbid them \nfrom doing so.  Finally, we have recognized a “general \npresumption that delegations to subordinates are permissible \nin cases of statutory silence.”  Frankl v. HTH Corp., 650 \nF.3d 1334, 1350 (9th Cir. 2011).  Because there are several\nways for duties to be delegable, my colleagues’ read of the\nFVRA—as  barring  ratification  of  actions  taken  in  the\nperformance of functions or duties only where Congress has\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 53 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 53 \nexpressly  forbidden  delegation—excludes  nearly  every \nstatutory function or duty in the United States Code.  This \ninterpretation is strained, but I agree that if we were limited \nto consulting the text of § 3348(a)(2) alone, the statutory \nlanguage could conceivably sustain it.  The problem is that \nthe structure and purpose of the FVRA confirm that the \nmajority’s interpretation is an inferior reading of the text. \nThe author of the majority reads the text of § 3348(a)(2) \nin isolation and concludes that it unambiguously refers to \nfunctions or duties that are expressly nondelegable.  But for \nthe reasons explained, the provision is susceptible to more \nthan one reading even when divorced from the statutory \ncontext.2  The majority author’s conclusion also does not \naccount for the bedrock principle that the “plainness or \nambiguity” of a provision must be “determined by reference \nto the language itself, the specific context in which the \nlanguage is used, and the broader context of the statute as a \nwhole.”  Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 \n(1997).   \nB \nBecause  the  meaning  of  “function  or  duty”  is \n“ambiguous, we must turn to the broader structure of the Act \nto determine the [provision’s] meaning.”  King v. Burwell, \n576 U.S. 473, 492 (2015).  “It is a fundamental canon of \nstatutory construction that the words of a statute must be read \nin their context and with a view to their place in the overall \nstatutory scheme.”  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  \n2 The third member of our panel agrees that § 3348(a)(2) is ambiguous. \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 54 of 64\n54 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nThe FVRA’s provisions work together to restrict the \nExecutive Branch’s discretion to allow officials to serve in \nSenate-confirmed  positions  without  actually  receiving \nSenate confirmation.  The Act allows limited use of acting \nofficers,  but  the  consequences  Congress  imposed  for \nviolating the FVRA incentivize the nomination of permanent \nofficials  who  are  subjected  to  the  Senate  confirmation \nprocess.  Three separate aspects of the FVRA’s statutory \ndesign support the conclusion that “function or duty” of a \nvacant office refers to duties that Congress directs a single \nofficer to perform, and excludes duties that Congress directs \nmore  than  one  officer  to  perform.    Of  the  permissible \nreadings of “function or duty” in § 3348(a)(2), only this one \n“produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the \nrest of the law.”  United Sav. Ass’n of Tex. v. Timbers of \nInwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988). \n1 \nFirst, Congress’s inclusion of § 3347(b) strongly favors \nreading  § 3348(d)(2)’s  ratification  bar  to  apply  to  all \nfunctions and duties that Congress has assigned to a single \nofficer, without regard to whether a duty is delegable.  In \n§3347(b),  Congress  acknowledged  general  vesting-and-\ndelegation statutes and expressly rejected the practice of\nrelying on them to bypass the FVRA’s rules of succession.\nSection 3348(d) ensures that there are consequences if the\nrules of succession are not followed.  Sections 3347(b) and\n3348(d) therefore work in tandem to cabin the discretion of\nthe Executive Branch to use acting officers.\nMy colleagues conclude that § 3347(b) “does not impact \nthe meaning of ‘function or duty’ in § 3348.”  I disagree. \nBoth sections are necessary parts of the exclusive scheme \nCongress adopted for the Executive Branch to temporarily \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 55 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 55 \nfill vacancies.  In § 3347(b), Congress took the unusual step \nof  anticipating  that  the  Executive  Branch  might  invoke \ngeneral delegation authority as a loophole to circumvent the \nAct’s  rules  of  succession,  and  expressly  foreclosed  the \nExecutive Branch from doing so.  The majority nevertheless \nconcludes  the  very  same  general  delegation  authority \nenables  the  Executive  Branch  to  avoid  the  Act’s \nconsequences.    Rather  than  working  in  tandem,  the \nmajority’s interpretation places §§ 3347(b) and 3348(d) at \nodds.  \n2 \nContext provides a second clue as to which reading of \n“function  or  duty”  is  most  consistent  with  the  FVRA’s \nstatutory design.  The majority holds that Congress defined \n“function or duty” to include only those duties that are made \nexpressly nondelegable by statute, even though the terms \n“delegate” or “nondelegable” do not appear anywhere in the \ndefinition of “function or duty.”  Such a glaring omission is \ncause enough to second-guess the majority’s conclusion. \nBut the significance of the omission of “nondelegable” from \n§3348(a)(2) is magnified by the FVRA’s use of the word\n“delegate”  in  the  immediately  preceding  subsection,\n§3347(b), because we must give meaning to the variation in\nword choice between the two provisions.  If a statute “has\nused one term in one place, and a materially different term\nin another, the presumption is that the different term denotes\na different idea.”  Sw. Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450,\n457–58 (2022) (quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 170 (2012)).\nIn  § 3347(b),  Congress  explicitly  used  the  word \n“delegate”;  accordingly,  we  presume  that  the  words  in \n§3348(a)(2)(A)(ii)—that a function or duty is one “required\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 56 of 64\n56 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nby statute to be performed by the applicable officer (and only \nthat officer)”—do not mean that the functions and duties that \nmay not be ratified are limited to those that Congress has \naffirmatively  deemed  nondelegable.    Congress’s  use  of \n“delegate”  in  § 3347(b)  “shows  that  when  Congress \nintended to” refer to delegable duties, “it knew how to do \nso.”  Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 492 (1994).  The \nmajority’s  failure  to  account  for  the  variation  between \n§§3347(b) and 3348(a)(2) further confirms that it adopts a\nstrained reading of the statutory text.\n3 \nA  third  rule  that  counsels  against  my  colleagues’ \ninterpretation is that we must not adopt a reading that renders \nan ambiguous provision “almost a nullity.”  Hernandez v. \nWilliams, Zinman & Parham PC, 829 F.3d 1068, 1077 (9th \nCir. 2016); see also Henderson v. United States, 568 U.S. \n266, 281 (2013) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“A rudimentary \nprinciple  of  textual  interpretation  .  .  .  is  that  if  one \ninterpretation of an ambiguous provision causes it to serve a \npurpose  consistent  with  the  entire  text,  and  the  other \ninterpretation renders it pointless, the former prevails.”). \nThe majority recognizes that its conclusion “limit[s] the \nscope” of the ratification bar.  But this concession buries the \nlede.  The majority actually renders the ratification bar all \nbut  inoperative  by  making  it  applicable  only  to  a \n“vanishingly  small”  number  of  functions  and  duties. \nArthrex, 35 F.4th at 1337 (citation omitted). \nUndeterred, the majority insists it “does not leave the \nFVRA  toothless”  because  actions  not  subject  to  the \nratification  bar  under  the  majority’s  interpretation  of \n“function or duty” “can still be found without legal force \nbased  on  other  provisions  of  the  FVRA”  and  “remain \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 57 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 57 \nvoidable on other grounds.”  But the majority fails to identify \nwhat other statutory basis exists in the FVRA that allows \ncourts to find actions “voidable.”  The cases the majority \ncites  do  not  support  its  position  because  each  of  them \nexpressly  states  that  whether  the  agency’s  action  was \nvoidable was not at issue.  See SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 298 n.2 \n(declining  to  reach  whether  NLRB  action  was  voidable \nunder the FVRA because the NLRB “did not seek certiorari \non this issue”); SW Gen., Inc. v. NLRB, 796 F.3d 67, 79 (D.C. \nCir. 2015) (assuming without deciding that NLRB action \nwas voidable under the FVRA), aff’d, 580 U.S. 288 (2017); \nHooks v. Kitsap Tenant Support Servs., Inc., 816 F.3d 550, \n564 (9th Cir. 2016) (deeming NLRB action voidable under \nthe FVRA because the NLRB did not contest that remedy).3  \nMy  colleagues  speculate  that  their  interpretation  of \n“function or duty” might not wind up frustrating the FVRA’s \nremedial scheme because, depending on the circumstances, \nthe Administrative Procedure Act might invalidate agency \nactions taken by improperly serving officers.  This sidesteps \nour task, which is to interpret the statute before us and to \nadopt a permissible reading that allows it to be understood \nas a harmonious whole.  Whether other statutes may provide \nmeans  of  redress  says  nothing  about  the  correct \ninterpretation of the FVRA. \nThe concurrence relies on legislative history contained \nin a Senate committee report addressing a prior version of \nthe bill that became the FVRA, and concludes that the report \nsupports the majority’s reading of “function or duty.”  See S. \n3 These courts did not consider the meaning of the ratification bar \nbecause the General Counsel of the NLRB is one of several offices the \nFVRA  exempts  from  the  penalty  provisions  of  § 3348(d).

Although the Senate report refers \nto nondelegable functions and duties, it does so in reference \nto a different subsection of the bill, § 3348(b), that addresses \na scenario not raised by the present case.4  See id. at 17–18.  \nThe reference the concurrence calls out demonstrates \nthat Congress knew precisely how to refer to nondelegable \nduties,  and  yet  it  did  not  use  those  words  in  the  text \n§3348(a)(2).    When  the  Federal  Circuit  considered  the\nmeaning of “function or duty” in the FVRA, it noted the\nsame language in the Senate report.  See Arthrex, 35 F.4th at\n1336–37.  Far from conclusive, the Federal Circuit found\nthat the references to nondelegable duties in the Senate\n4 Section 3348(b) requires that a Senate-confirmed agency head take on \nall functions and duties of a vacant subordinate office unless an acting \nofficer fills  the  vacant  subordinate  office pursuant  to  the  FVRA’s \nsuccession rules.  5 U.S.C. § 3348(b).

No. 105-250, at 18.  The report reflects the concerns of \ncommittee members who worried that “administrative paralysis” would \nresult if an agency head were forced to perform the numerous delegable \nfunctions and duties of vacant subordinate offices.  S. Rep. No. 105-250, \nat 31.  When addressing the duties subject to the ratification bar, the \nSenate report makes clear that the committee was treating the situation \nin  the  present  case—where  the  agency  head  lacks  valid  acting \nauthority—differently from a situation where a subordinate officer lacks \nvalid acting authority pursuant to § 3348(b).  The Senate report states \nthat  when  one  who,  “not  being  the  agency  head”  “perform[s] \nnondelegable  duties  of”  a  subordinate  office—in  violation  of \n§3348(b)—the ratification bar applies.  Id. at 19.  But it also provides,\nwithout limitation, that “the successor in the office by virtue of his\nappointment by the President by and with the advice and the consent of\nthe Senate may not ratify the actions of a person who filled the office in\nviolation of the legislation’s provisions.”  Id.\n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 59 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 59 \nreport  merely  revealed  the  “competing  narratives  in  the \nlegislative history.”  Id. at 1337.   \nThe concurrence nevertheless sees unequivocal support \nfor  the  majority’s  interpretation  in  the  Senate  report, \noverlooking that the report leaves no doubt that the Senate \ncommittee’s unambiguous aim was to avoid the very result \nthat the majority urges here.  Specifically, the report explains \nthat  the  FVRA  was  intended  “[t]o  ensure  an  effective \nenforcement mechanism and to overturn the recent decision \nof the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit in Doolin Security Savings Bank v. Office \nof Thrift Supervision, 139 F.3d 203 (D.C. Cir. 1998).”  S. \nRep.  No.  105-250,  at  11.    In  Doolin,  the  D.C.  Circuit \naddressed a challenge to an order issued by the now-defunct \nOffice of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  139 F.3d at 204.  An \nacting director of OTS initiated administrative enforcement \nproceedings against a bank and resigned two and a half years \nlater,  before  adopting  an  administrative  law  judge’s \nrecommended decision.  Id.  The President invoked the \nVacancies Act to name a new acting director,  and that \ndirector issued a final opinion and cease and desist order \nagainst the bank.  Id.  The bank appealed and argued that the \ncease and desist order was void because the first acting \ndirector—who initiated the enforcement action—was not \nappointed pursuant to the Vacancies Act and because the \nsecond acting director—who signed the final order—was \nappointed after the President’s authority under the Vacancies \nAct had expired.  Id. at 207, 211.  The D.C. Circuit held that \nthe second acting director was validly appointed pursuant to \nthe Vacancies Act.  Id. at 211.  The court further held that \nany violation of the Vacancies Act with respect to the first \nacting  director  was  harmless  because  the  second  acting \ndirector  ratified  his  predecessor’s  initiation  of  the \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 60 of 64\n60 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nenforcement action when he issued the final cease and desist \norder.  Id. at 211, 214.  \nThe Senate report makes plain the committee’s reaction \nto Doolin’s ratification holding: “if any subsequent acting \nofficial or anyone else can ratify the actions of a person who \nserved beyond the length of time provided by the Vacancies \nAct, then no consequence will derive from an illegal acting \ndesignation.”  S. Rep. No. 105-250, at 8.  The Senate report \nexplains that the committee included the ratification bar in \nthe FVRA because it was “concerned that the ratification \napproach  taken  by  the  court  in  Doolin  would  render \nenforcement of the [FVRA] a nullity in many instances.”  Id. \nat 20.  Thus, if the legislative history in the Senate report is \nconsidered, it does not support the majority’s conclusion that \nthe Act permits end runs around the ratification bar.  To the \ncontrary, because the function at issue in Doolin was one the \nOTS director could have delegated to a subordinate, the \ncommittee’s intent to overrule Doolin makes clear that it \ncould not have intended the ratification bar to be limited to \nonly those actions taken in the performance of nondelegable \nduties.5   \n5 OTS’s authorizing statutes vested in the director the “power to enforce” \nthe agency’s statutes and regulations, 12 U.S.C. § 1464(d)(1)(A) (1994), \nand to “issue such orders” as necessary, 12 U.S.C. § 1462a(b)(2) (1994). \nJust as with DHS in this case, Congress permitted the OTS director to \n“delegate to any employee, representative, or agent any” of the director’s \npowers.  Id. § 1462a(h)(4)(A)(ii).  Indeed, the first acting director \nobtained his purported authority when the outgoing director “delegated \nto him ‘all the powers of the Director’” pursuant to § 1462a(h)(4)(A)(ii).  \nDoolin, 139 F.3d at 211.  Thus, the acting director who initiated the \nenforcement action in Doolin was exercising a delegable function.  Yet, \nunder the majority’s view, the FVRA’s ratification bar still would not \nprevent ratification of that acting director’s actions.   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 61 of 64\nGONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 61 \nOur analysis should be grounded in the Act’s text and \nstructure.  The permissible reading of “function or duty” that \nallows the FVRA’s provisions to work together is also the \nplainest reading of the words Congress used: when officials \nimproperly  serve  in  positions  that  require  presidential \nappointment  and  Senate  confirmation,  the  FVRA  bars \nratification of actions those officials take in performing any \nfunction or duty that Congress required a single officer to \nperform.   \nC \nThis reading of the ratification bar is further confirmed \nby “the context in which [the FVRA] was enacted and the \npurposes it was designed to accomplish.”  Jones v. R.R. \nDonnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 377 (2004) (turning to \ncontext  and  purpose  after  deeming  statutory  text \nambiguous).    As  the  Supreme  Court  has  explained,  the \nFVRA was Congress’s response to the Executive Branch \nallowing acting officers to serve well past the deadlines in \nthe Vacancies Act and using vesting-and-delegation statutes \nto entirely circumvent the Vacancies Act’s grace period.  See \nSW Gen., 580 U.S. at 294–95; see also Rosenberg at 1–3.  \nIndeed,  the  Vacancies  Act  lacked  any  enforcement \nmechanism, see 15 Stat. 168, and the remedial provision in \n§3348(d) was the key innovation of the FVRA.\nWith this context, the clear purpose of the FVRA is to\nallow  for  the  limited  use  of  acting  officers  while \nstrengthening protection of the Senate’s advice-and-consent \nrole, in part by encouraging the advancement of nominees \nby  adding  consequences  for  the  Executive  Branch’s \nnoncompliance.  See SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 295–96.  To \nfurther this purpose, the ratification bar must extend to the \nduties Congress grants to a single officer—and not to those \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 62 of 64\n62 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nfunctions  and  duties  granted  to  multiple  officers.    The \nmajority’s limitation of the ratification bar to only those \nduties that Congress expressly deems nondelegable guts the \nFVRA.  See N.Y. State Dep’t of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 \nU.S.  405,  419–20  (1973)  (“We  cannot  interpret  federal \nstatutes to negate their own stated purposes.”). \nAt  least  some  agencies  have  applied  the  majority’s \ninterpretation of the FVRA to continue operating as if the \nstatute had never been enacted.  For example, when there \nhave  been  vacancies  in  both  the  Director  and  Deputy \nDirector positions in the United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice (USPTO), the agency has used the Commissioner of \nPatents to perform the duties of the Director and explained \nthat the Commissioner “has not been, and need not be, \nappointed  ‘Acting  Director’  of  the  USPTO  under  the \n[FVRA].”6  Though Congress required only the Director to \nperform these duties, see, e.g., 35 U.S.C. § 3(a)(2)(A), the \nUSPTO asserted that it need not comply with the FVRA \nbecause compliance with the Act “is only needed” when \nthere are duties “that are exclusive to that particular [Senate-\nconfirmed] Officer” and “[a]ll of the Director[’s] duties . . . \nare delegable (i.e., non-exclusive) duties.”7  Other agencies \nhave adopted a similar practice.  See, e.g., Bullock v. U.S. \nBureau of Land Mgmt., 489 F. Supp. 3d 1112, 1128–29 (D. \nMont. 2020) (finding that a deputy director of the Bureau of \nLand Management violated the FVRA when he used general \n6 See Notice of Delegation of Functions and Duties at the USPTO, U.S. \nPat.  &  Trademark  Off.

AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS 63 \ndelegation authority to perform the duties of the vacant \nDirector’s office).  This is the precise end-run that § 3347(b) \nwas enacted to prevent.8   \nI  recognize  that  the  ratification  bar  is  a  harsh \nconsequence and that the interpretation I advance has the \npotential to imperil many agency actions if an official has \nserved in violation of the Act.  I also recognize that the \nlengthy  confirmation  process,  and  the  large  number  of \nExecutive  positions  requiring  Senate  confirmation, \nnecessitates reliance on acting officers to keep the wheels of \nour federal government turning.  But the ratification bar only \nkicks in if an agency does not follow the FVRA’s chain of \nsuccession or if an acting officer serves for longer than 210 \ndays.  The Act also accounts for the uncertainties of the \nconfirmation process: if an initial nominee is rejected or \nreturned by the Senate, or withdraws from consideration, the \n210-day limit starts anew.  See § 3346(b)(1).  Once a second\nnominee is submitted to the Senate, the acting officer may\ncontinue to serve until the nominee is confirmed or for 210\ndays  after  the  second  nominee  is  rejected,  returned,  or\nwithdrawn.  § 3346(b)(2).  The FVRA’s design thus prevents\nthe President from simply failing to nominate a permanent\nofficer for the Senate’s consideration.  There have been a\n8 The concurrence notes that Professor Anne Joseph O’Connell has \nwritten that broad delegations of authority “appear[] to provide an easy \nworkaround” to the FVRA.  Anne Joseph O’Connell, Actings, 120 \nColum. L. Rev. 613, 633 (2020).  But Professor O’Connell explained \nthat she only “treats [agencies’ delegation practices] as permissible \n(though not necessarily desirable) under the” FVRA because they “are \npervasive and have largely been upheld by the limited courts to consider \nthem.”  Id. at 633 n.105.  Professor O’Connell’s careful observation \nabout Executive Branch practice and the nascent state of the relevant \ncaselaw did not endorse of agencies’ circumvention of the FVRA nor \nanalyze the Act’s definition of “function or duty.”  \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 71   Filed 07/18/24   Page 64 of 64\n64 GONZALES & GONZALES BONDS & INS. AGENCY, INC. V. USDHS \nfew notable exceptions, but officials serving in violation of \nthe Act have not been common.   \nD \nWith the meaning of “function or duty” in hand, the \noutcome of this appeal is straightforward.  Chad Wolf was \nwithout authority to issue the surety bonds rule because he \nwas not properly acting as DHS Secretary under the FVRA. \nCongress directed only the DHS Secretary to promulgate \nsurety bond rules.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3).  The issuance \nof surety bonds rules is a “function or duty” of the DHS \nSecretary within the meaning of § 3348(a)(2), so it follows \nunder  § 3348(d)  that  Wolf’s  promulgation  of  the  surety \nbonds rule was without force or effect and could not be \nratified by Wolf’s successor.   \nIII \nI  would  affirm  the  district  court’s  order  granting \nPlaintiff-Appellees’  motion  for  summary  judgment. \nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.

BACKGROUND \n21  Plaintiffs are companies who post immigration bonds either as federally approved surety \n22  companies or on behalf of federally approved surety companies.  (First Am. Compl., “FAC,” Dkt. \n23  No. 36 ¶¶ 2, 20-24.)  Surety bonds may be posted with Defendant Department of Homeland \n24  Security (“DHS”) to guarantee that an individual will appear during their immigration removal \n25  proceedings.  (FAC ¶ 2.)  When an individual fails to appear, the surety owes a fixed amount of \n26  money to Defendant DHS as a result of the “breach” of the bond.  (See Defs.’ Mot., Dkt. No. 39 at \n27  2.) \n28  On July 31, 2020, Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf issued a Final Rule, which: (1) \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 2 of 9\n \n1  requires sureties challenging a bond breach determination to administratively exhaust their claims \n2  by appealing to the Administrative Appeals Office (“AAO”), (2) imposes a $675 fee to appeal \n3  bond breach determinations, and (3) created new criteria for Defendant DHS to determine whether \n4  it will continue to accept immigration bonds from a particular surety.  (FAC ¶¶ 1, 2, 11, 39.)  \n5  These criteria include whenever: (1) DHS claims ten or more invoices issued to the surety on \n6  administratively final breach determinations are past due, (2) the surety owes at least $50,000 on \n7  past due invoices, or (3) the surety has a breach rate of at least 35% based on administratively final \n8  breach determinations and bond cancellations.  (FAC ¶ 64.)  Plaintiffs allege that the \n9  administrative process does not provide the surety with due process, because breach \n10  determinations are almost universally upheld, thereby depriving Plaintiffs of a meaningful \n11  opportunity to challenge a breach declaration. (FAC ¶ 15.)  Since July 31, 2020, Plaintiffs have \n12  posted more than one thousand immigration bonds, and DHS has declared breaches in over 70 of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  those bonds. (FAC ¶ 14.)  Of those 70 breaches, Plaintiffs allege that a significant number were \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  wrongfully declared. Id.  Plaintiffs, however, have not challenged the breach declarations, and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  have instead paid a substantial number of bonds declared breached, even when they believe the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  breach declaration lacks merit, because of the expense and futility of appealing a breach to the \nS d nr\nee 17  AAO. (FAC ¶ 16.)   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  On April 15, 2021, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ratified the Final Rule. (Dkt. No. \n19  31-1.)  Plaintiffs allege that after-the-fact ratification cannot cure the issuance of a final rule \n20  promulgated by an unauthorized official. (FAC ¶¶ 37-38.) \n21  On December 14, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit, asserting that the Final Rule \n22  violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection \n23  guarantee.  (Compl., Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 78-92.)  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 3, \n24  2021. (FAC, Dkt. No. 36.) \n25  On August 24, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  (Defs.’ Mot.. Dkt. No. 39.)  On \n26  September 14, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opposition.  (Pls.’ Opp’n, Dkt. No. 41.)  On September \n27  24, 2021, Defendants filed their reply.  (Defs.’ Reply, Dkt. No. 42.) \n28  // \n2 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 3 of 9\n \n1  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n2  A.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n3  A defendant may move to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant \n4  to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).  A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \n5  jurisdiction will be granted if the complaint on its face fails to allege facts sufficient to establish \n6  subject matter jurisdiction.  See Savage v. Glendale Union High Sch., 343 F.3d 1036, 1039 n.2 \n7  (9th Cir. 2003).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the Court “is not restricted to the face of \n8  the pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and testimony, to resolve factual \n9  disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction.”  McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 \n10  (9th Cir. 1988).  Once a party has moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \n11  Rule 12(b)(1), the opposing party bears the burden of establishing the court’s jurisdiction.  See \n12  Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2010). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  B.  Rule 12(b)(3) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  A defendant may challenge venue under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).  Upon \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  such a challenge, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that venue is proper. Piedmont \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Label Co. v. Sun Garden Packing Co., 598 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1979).  When considering a \nS d nr\nee 17  Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss, the pleadings need not be accepted as true, and the court “may \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  consider facts outside of the pleadings.” Richardson v. Lloyd's of London, 135 F.3d 1289, 1292 \n19  (9th Cir. 1998).  If the court determines that venue is improper, it may dismiss the case, or, if it is \n20  in the interest of justice, transfer it to any district in which it properly could have been brought. 28 \n21  U.S.C. § 1406(a); Dist. No. 1, Pac. Coast Dist. v. Alaska, 682 F.2d 797, 799 (9th Cir. 1982). \n22  C.  Rule 12(b)(6) \n23  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a party may file a motion to dismiss based \n24  on the failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. A motion to dismiss under Rule \n25  12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. Navarro v. Block, 250 \n26  F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n27  In considering such a motion, a court must “accept as true all of the factual allegations \n28  contained in the complaint,” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam) (citation \n3 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 4 of 9\n \n1  omitted), and may dismiss the case or a claim “only where there is no cognizable legal theory” or \n2  there is an absence of “sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief.” \n3  Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing \n4  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-78 (2009); Navarro, 250 F.3d at 732) (internal quotation \n5  marks omitted).  \n6  A claim is plausible on its face when a plaintiff “pleads factual content that allows the \n7  court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” \n8  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citation omitted). In other words, the facts alleged must demonstrate “more \n9  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not \n10  do.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). “Threadbare recitals of the elements of \n11  a cause of action” and “conclusory statements” are inadequate. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; see also \n12  Epstein v. Wash. Energy Co., 83 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 1996) (“[C]onclusory allegations of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  claim.”). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully . . . When a complaint pleads facts \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility \nS d nr\nee 17  and plausibility of entitlement to relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  557) (internal citations omitted).  \n19  Generally, if the court grants a motion to dismiss, it should grant leave to amend even if no \n20  request to amend is made “unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by \n21  the allegation of other facts.” Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations \n22  omitted). \n23  III.  DISCUSSION \n24  Defendants move to dismiss on four separate grounds: lack of standing, ripeness, improper \n25  venue, and failure to state a claim. (Defs.’ Mot. at 2.) \n26  A.  Whether Plaintiffs Lack Standing \n27  Article III standing requires the demonstration of three elements: (1) the plaintiff suffered \n28  an “injury in fact” that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or \n4 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 5 of 9\n \n1  hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is \n2  likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  \n3  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  Absent this showing, the action \n4  must be dismissed.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 109-10 (1998). \n5  “[T]he Constitution mandates that prior to [a court’s] exercise of jurisdiction there exist a \n6  constitutional ‘case or controversy,’ that the issues presented are ‘definite and concrete, not \n7  hypothetical or abstract.’”  Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th \n8  Cir. 2000) (quoting Railway Mail Ass’n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 93 (1945)).  To determine if \n9  jurisdiction is satisfied, the court “consider[s] whether the plaintiffs face a realistic danger of \n10  sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s operation or enforcement,’ or whether the \n11  alleged injury is too ‘imaginary’ or ‘speculative’ to support jurisdiction.”  Id. (quoting Babbit v. \n12  United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979).  “[N]either the mere existence of a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution,” however, “satisfies the ‘case or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  controversy’ requirement.”  Id.  To determine there is a genuine threat of prosecution, the courts \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “look to whether the plaintiffs have articulated a ‘concrete plan’ to violate the law in question, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate \nS d nr\nee 17  proceedings, and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.”  Id.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  It is not enough to simply allege the provisions of the Final Rule; “the mere existence of a statute, \n19  which may or may not ever be applied to plaintiffs, is not sufficient to create a case or controversy \n20  within the meaning of Article III.”  San Diego Cty. Gun Rights Comm. v. Reno, 98 F.3d 1121, \n21  1126 (9th Cir. 1996).  \n22  Here, Plaintiffs allege that the debarment provisions are based on breach determinations, \n23  which Plaintiffs are not appealing because they believe that the administrative process is \n24  expensive and futile because they will ultimately have to pay for the breach regardless of the \n25  merits. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 5; FAC ¶¶ 14-16.)  To the extent that Defendants argue that Plaintiffs \n26  have to allege that one of them has appealed a breached bond, the Court finds that deterrence is \n27  enough to satisfy the injury in fact requirement.  The Court is similarly unpersuaded that Plaintiffs \n28  have failed to show redressability, because deterrence is sufficient. (See Defs.’ Mot. at 14.) \n5 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 6 of 9\n \n1  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have established standing because they have adequately alleged an \n2  injury in fact. \n3  B.  Ripeness \n4  Defendants also move to dismiss the operative complaint on the grounds that it is not ripe. \n5  (Defs.’ Mot. at 15.)  “Standing and ripeness under Article III are closely related.” Colwell v. Dep't \n6  of Health & Human Servs., 558 F.3d 1112, 1123 (9th Cir. 2009). “For a suit to be ripe within the \n7  meaning of Article III, it must present concrete legal issues, presented in actual cases, not \n8  abstractions.” Id. (quoting United Pub. Workers v. Mitchell, 300 U.S. 75, 89 (1947)). “But \n9  whereas ‘standing is primarily concerned with who is a proper party to litigate a particular matter, \n10  ripeness addressees when that litigation may occur.’” Id. (quoting Lee v. Oregon, 107 F.3d 1382, \n11  1387 (9th Cir. 1997)). The constitutional ripeness inquiry generally “coincides squarely with \n12  standing's injury in fact prong.” Sacks v. Off. of Foreign Assets Control, 466 F.3d 764, 773 (9th \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Cir. 2006) (quoting Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rts. Comm'n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2000) (en banc)). Thus, where the court determines that the plaintiff's “stake in the legal issues is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  concrete rather than abstract,” constitutional ripeness is satisfied. Colwell, 558 F.3d at 1123. As \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  discussed above, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged an injury in fact, such that the constitutional \nS d nr\nee 17  ripeness requirement is satisfied. See id.; see also discussion, supra, PART III.A. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants, however, argue that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the prudential ripeness \n19  requirement, because none of the plaintiffs have filed an administrative appeal under the Final \n20  Rule of any breach determination. (Defs.’ Mot. at 15.)  The Court disagrees.  \n21  In evaluating the prudential aspects of ripeness, courts must be “guided by two overarching \n22  considerations: ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of \n23  withholding court consideration.’” Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1141 (citing Abbott Laboratories v. \n24  Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967); Hodgers–Durgin v. De La Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040–41 (9th \n25  Cir.1999) (en banc); San Diego Cty. Gun Rts. Comm. v. Reno, 98 F.3d 1121, 1132 (9th Cir. \n26  1996)).  Here, there is a concrete factual situation, because there is a designated administrative \n27  appeals process once a bond is deemed breached by DHS.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs clearly allege \n28  that the appeals process is rigged and that they will suffer harm by the debarment provisions, \n6 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 7 of 9\n \n1  which are based on the number of breach determinations. (See FAC ¶ 16.)  Thus, prudential \n2  ripeness is also satisfied.  \n3  Accordingly, the claims are ripe for adjudication. \n4  C.  Whether Venue is Proper \n5  Alternatively, Defendants argue that venue is improper in this district. (Defs.’ Mot. at 16-\n6  17.)  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), a civil action brought against the United States or its agencies \n7  and employees may be brought in any judicial district in which: “(A) a defendant in the action \n8  resides, (B) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred . . . , or \n9  (C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.”  \n10  In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that they have posted bonds in this district that were \n11  breached, which renders venue proper even if material events, including the actual breach, \n12  occurred elsewhere. (Pls.’ Opp’n at 10 (citing Richmond Techs., Inc. v. Aumtech Bus. Solutions, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  No. 11-cv-02460-LHK, 2011 WL 2607158, at *10 (N.D. Cal., July 1, 2011) (venue proper if \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “substantial part” of the underlying events took place in the district)).  In the operative complaint, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs allege that, since July 31, 2020, they have posted over a thousand immigration bonds. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (FAC ¶ 14.)  Of those bonds, over 70 were declared to be breached by DHS, and a “significant \nS d nr\nee 17  number of those immigration bonds were wrongfully declared breaches. Id.  Surely the posting of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the bond is a “substantial part” of the underlying events, because posting of the bond is a \n19  prerequisite to a declaration of breach.  Simply put, no breach could occur absent posting of the \n20  immigration bond. \n21  Thus, the Court finds that venue is proper, and denies the motion to dismiss pursuant to \n22  Rule 12(b)(3). \n23  D.  Whether Count I fails to state a claim \n24  Finally, Defendant move to dismiss the first cause of action to set aside the Final Rule on \n25  the grounds that Chad Wolf was not validly appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and \n26  lacked authority to issue the Final Rule. (FAC ¶¶ 91-96.)  Defendants argue that Secretary \n27  Mayorkas’s ratification of the Final Rule cures any alleged defects in the rule arising from Chad \n28  Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of DHS. (Defs.’ Mot. at 20.)  The Court disagrees. \n7 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 8 of 9\n \n1  Defendants cite to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Gordon, 819 F.3d 1179, \n2  1190-92 (9th Cir. 2016), in support of their argument. (Defs.’ Mot. at 20.)  That case is readily \n3  distinguishable, because it did not involve the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), and, \n4  therefore, did not address the FVRA’s “unequivocal langua[g]e prohibiting ratification.” Behring \n5  Reg'l Ctr. LLC v. Wolf, No. 20-CV-09263-JSC, 2021 WL 2554051, at *8 (N.D. Cal. June 22, \n6  2021).  The Court also notes that Consumer Financial Protection involves the issuance of a final \n7  rule from an individual who was later validly appointed to the position. Consumer Fin. Prot. \n8  Bureau, 819 F.3d at 1191. Mr. Wolf was never confirmed by the Senate, and so was never \n9  lawfully DHS Secretary. \n10  The Court is persuaded by Behring, in which the district court found that the invalid \n11  appointment of Kevin McAleenan invalidated the final rule issued, and that the after-the-fact \n12  ratification by Secretary Mayorkas could not cure the defect. Behring, 2021 WL 2554051, at *8.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The court explained that “[t]he government's argument is foreclosed by the FVRA's plain and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  unambiguous language: ‘An action that has no force or effect under paragraph (1) may not be \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  ratified.’” Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(2); also citing 5 U.S.C. § 551(5) (“actions” include \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “rule making”)).  Secretary Kirstjen Nielson’s failure to properly amend the order of succession1, \nS d nr\nee 17  rendered the succession of Mr. McAleenan, and later Mr. Wolf, to Acting Secretary invalid. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Behring, 2021 WL 2554051, at *7.  Thus, Mr. Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary \n19  at the time the Final Order was issued, and the later ratification of Secretary Mayorkas does not \n20  cure the defect in issuing the Final Rule, because the ratification itself violates the FVRA. 5 \n21  U.S.C. § 3348(d)(2). \n22  To the extent that Defendants argue that the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) \n23  provides the Secretary with the authority to promulgate and issue final rules independent of the \n24  FVRA, that argument is unavailing. (See Defs.’ Mot. at 23.)  Indeed, Behring concerned a \n25 \n \n1 Secretary Nielson was the last Senate-confirmed DHS Secretary prior to Mr. Wolf. Behring, \n26 \n2021 WL 2554051, at *2. Prior to her resignation, she amended the Order of Succession for \nHomeland Security Secretary, but she made a mistake and amended the wrong order of \n27 \nsuccession. Id. In sum, rather than amending the order of succession following the Secretary’s \ndeath, resignation, or inability to perform, she amended the order concerning who is temporarily in \n28 \ncharge when the Secretary is unavailable during a disaster or catastrophic emergency. Id.  \n8 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 44   Filed 10/19/21   Page 9 of 9\n \n1  program established by the INA. Behring, 2021 WL 2554051, at *3.  Thus, Plaintiffs adequately \n2  plead a cause of action for violation of the APA. \n3  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss the first cause of action is denied. \n4  IV.  CONCLUSION \n5  For the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED.  Defendants \n6  shall file an answer within 14 days of this order. \n7  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n8  Dated: October 19, 2021 \n__________________________________ \n9 \nKANDIS A.

No. 24 \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \n11  HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n12  Defendants. \na \ntr in  \nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  On December 14, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the instant suit, challenging a final rule imposing \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  additional requirements on immigration bond sureties (“Final Rule”).  (Compl. ¶ 1, Dkt. No. 1.)  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Pending before the Court is Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing and improper \nS d nr\nee 17  venue.  (Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 24.)  The Court previously deemed the matter suitable \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  for disposition without a hearing and vacated the hearing.  (Dkt. No. 32.)  Having considered the \n19  parties’ filings and the relevant legal authorities, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to \n20  dismiss. \n21  I.  BACKGROUND \n22  Plaintiffs are companies who post immigration bonds either as federally approved surety \n23  companies or on behalf of federally approved surety companies.  (Compl. ¶¶ 2, 16-20.)  Surety \n24  bonds may be posted with Defendant Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to guarantee \n25  that an individual will appear during their immigration removal proceedings.  (Compl. ¶ 2.)  When \n26  an individual fails to appear, the surety owes a fixed amount of money to Defendant DHS as a \n27  result of the “breach” of the bond.  (See Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 2.) \n28  On July 31, 2020, Defendant DHS issued a Final Rule, which: (1) requires sureties \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 33   Filed 07/13/21   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  challenging a bond breach determination to administratively exhaust their claims by appealing to \n2  the Administrative Appeals Office (“AAO”), (2) imposes a $675 fee to appeal bond breach \n3  determinations, and (3) created new criteria for Defendant DHS to determine whether it will \n4  continue to accept immigration bonds from a particular surety.  (Compl. ¶¶ 2, 4, 26, 51.)  These \n5  criteria include whenever: (1) DHS claims ten or more invoices issued to the surety on \n6  administratively final breach determinations are past due, (2) the surety owes at least $50,000 on \n7  past due invoices, or (3) the surety has a breach rate of at least 35% based on administratively final \n8  breach determinations and bond cancellations.  (Compl. ¶ 51.) \n9  On December 14, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the instant suit, asserting that the Final Rule \n10  violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection \n11  guarantee.  (Comp. ¶¶ 78-92.)  On March 30, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the \n12  grounds that Plaintiffs lack standing, that the case is not ripe, and that venue is improper.  (Defs.’ \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Mot. to Dismiss at 3.)  On April 26, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opposition.  (Pls.’ Opp’n, Dkt. No. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  29.)  On May 6, 2021, Defendants filed their reply.  (Defs.’ Reply, Dkt. No. 31.) \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  A defendant may move to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant \nS d nr\nee 17  to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).  A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  jurisdiction will be granted if the complaint on its face fails to allege facts sufficient to establish \n19  subject matter jurisdiction.  See Savage v. Glendale Union High Sch., 343 F.3d 1036, 1039 n.2 \n20  (9th Cir. 2003).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the Court “is not restricted to the face of \n21  the pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and testimony, to resolve factual \n22  disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction.”  McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 \n23  (9th Cir. 1988).  Once a party has moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \n24  Rule 12(b)(1), the opposing party bears the burden of establishing the court’s jurisdiction.  See \n25  Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2010). \n26  III.  DISCUSSION \n27  A.  Standing \n28  Article III standing requires the demonstration of three elements: (1) the plaintiff suffered \n2 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 33   Filed 07/13/21   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  an “injury in fact” that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or \n2  hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is \n3  likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  \n4  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  Absent this showing, the action \n5  must be dismissed.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 109-10 (1998). \n6  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not established standing because Plaintiffs have not \n7  adequately alleged an injury in fact.  “[T]he Constitution mandates that prior to [a court’s] exercise \n8  of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional ‘case or controversy,’ that the issues presented are \n9  ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.’”  Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights \n10  Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Railway Mail Ass’n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, \n11  93 (1945)).  To determine if jurisdiction is satisfied, the court “consider[s] whether the plaintiffs \n12  face a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s operation or \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  enforcement,’ or whether the alleged injury is too ‘imaginary’ or ‘speculative’ to support \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  jurisdiction.”  Id. (quoting Babbit v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979).  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “[N]either the mere existence of a proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution,” \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  however, “satisfies the ‘case or controversy’ requirement.”  Id.  To determine there is a genuine \nS d nr\nee 17  threat of prosecution, the courts “look to whether the plaintiffs have articulated a ‘concrete plan’ to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  violate the law in question, whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific \n19  warning or threat to initiate proceedings, and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under \n20  the challenged statute.”  Id.  It is not enough to simply allege the provisions of the Final Rule; “the \n21  mere existence of a statute, which may or may not ever be applied to plaintiffs, is not sufficient to \n22  create a case or controversy within the meaning of Article III.”  San Diego Cty. Gun Rights Comm. \n23  v. Reno, 98 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir. 1996).  \n24  Here, Plaintiffs’ only allegations regarding their potential injury are that they are “engaged \n25  in the business of posting immigration bonds on behalf of federally approved surety companies \n26  with DHS for, among other things, the release of aliens from detention pending a determination of \n27  the alien’s immigration status,” and that “they have been and will be injured by the Final Rule’s \n28  operation.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 13, 16-20.)  In their opposition, Plaintiffs assert that they will be required \n3 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 33   Filed 07/13/21   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  to file a $675 administrative appeal for every immigration bond that Defendant DHS determines to \n2  be breached.  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 10.)  In their complaint, however, Plaintiffs do not make any specific \n3  allegations that their bonds have ever been found to be breached, or that the breaches were \n4  wrongfully determined.  Without such information, it is not clear that Plaintiffs would ever have \n5  the opportunity or grounds to appeal a breach determination, and thus incur the injury of paying \n6  the $675 fee to appeal.  While it is possible that Plaintiffs may be injured by the Final Rule, a \n7  “possible future injury” is not enough; the threatened injury “must be certainly impending to \n8  constitute injury in fact.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) (original \n9  emphasis).  \n10  Likewise, Plaintiffs argue that the debarment provisions of the Final Rule are based on the \n11  breach determinations, which cannot be properly appealed under the Final Rule.  (Pls.’ Opp’n at \n12  5.)  As Plaintiffs’ injury due to the debarment provisions are based on their alleged inability to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  appeal breach determinations, specific allegations demonstrating that Plaintiffs will need to appeal \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  a breach determination are necessary.  Absent such allegations, Plaintiffs’ injury is speculative.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege an injury that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  satisfies Article III’s standing requirement.  Because Plaintiffs have failed to allege injury in fact, \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs have also failed to allege ripeness.  (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 7 (“Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the same reasons they have standing.”); Coons v. Lew, 762 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir. 2014) (“The \n19  constitutional component of the ripeness inquiry is often treated under the rubric of standing and, \n20  in many cases, ripeness coincides squarely with standing’s injury in fact prong.”).) \n21  B.  Venue \n22  In the alternative, Defendants argue that venue is improper in this district.  Under 28 \n23  U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), a civil action brought against the United States or its agencies and employees \n24  may be brought in any judicial district in which: “(A) a defendant in the action resides, (B) a \n25  substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred . . . , or (C) the \n26  plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.”  \n27  Because the Court finds that there is no constitutional standing, and thus no jurisdiction \n28  over the case, the Court need not determine if venue was proper.  The Court observes, however, \n4 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 33   Filed 07/13/21   Page 5 of 5\n \n1  that it appears Plaintiff Gonzales & Gonzales (“G&G”) is a California corporation located in \n2  California, and that Defendant DHS previously filed suit against Plaintiff G&G in this district in \n3  August 2009.  (See Compl. ¶ 16; United States v. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds & Ins. Agency, Inc., \n4  Case No. 09-cv-4029-EMC (asserting venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) (“a judicial district in \n5  which any defendant resides”).)  Thus, it is not clear to the Court that venue is improper. \n6  IV.  CONCLUSION \n7  For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged \n8  standing or ripeness, and that the Court therefore lacks jurisdiction over the case.  Amendment, \n9  however, does not appear to be futile, as Plaintiffs state that they can amend the complaint to \n10  include the number of bonds posted and deemed breached since the Final Rule was issued.  (Pls.’ \n11  Opp’n at 5.)  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to dismiss without prejudice.  \n12  Plaintiffs shall file an amended complaint within 21 days of the date of this order. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Dated: July 13, 2021 \ni\nrts fo __________________________________ \niD tc 15 \n sir KANDIS A.

No. 59 \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \n11  HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n12  Defendants. \na \ntr in  \nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  On May 12, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on the limited issue of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  whether the Final Rule was lawfully promulgated. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Upon review of the moving papers, the Court finds this matter suitable for resolution \nS d nr\nee 17  without oral argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), and, for the reasons set forth below, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. \n19  I.  BACKGROUND \n20  Plaintiffs are companies who post immigration bonds either as federally approved surety \n21  companies or on behalf of federally approved surety companies.  While removal proceedings are \n22  pending, Defendant Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) often takes noncitizens into \n23  custody; however, once identified and processed, DHS may release noncitizens conditioned on \n24  posting a bond to guarantee that an individual appear upon request at either a DHS office or future \n25  hearing. See Procedures and Standards for Declining Surety Immigration Bonds and \n26  Administrative Appeal Requirement for Breaches, 85 Fed. Reg. 45,968-69 (July 31, 2020) (“the \n27  Final Rule”).  One way to post bond is by using a “surety bond,” which are guaranteed by \n28  companies certified to underwrite Federal bonds, who serve as co-obligors. See id. at 45,969.  As a \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 67   Filed 08/10/22   Page 2 of 6\n \n1  result, if the noncitizen fails to appear and DHS determines the bond to be breached, then the \n2  surety must pay a fixed sum to DHS as a result of the breach. Id. \n3  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”) generally serves as the “exclusive means for \n4  temporarily authorizing an acting official” during a vacancy in a Senate-confirmed office, unless, \n5  in relevant part, a “statutory provision expressly . . . authorizes” the President, a court, or the head \n6  of a Department to designate an acting official or “designate[s] an officer or employee” to serve as \n7  the acting official. See 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)(1).  The Homeland Security Act (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § \n8  113(g), is one such statute.  It provides that “[n]otwithstanding” the FVRA, the Under Secretary \n9  for Management shall serve as Acting Secretary in the event of vacancies in the offices of the \n10  Secretary and Deputy Secretary and that “the Secretary may designate such other officers of the \n11  Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.” Id. § 113(g)(1)-(2). \n12  On April 10, 2019, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen resigned.  On April 9, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  she purportedly exercised her authority under § 113(g)(2) to issue an order titled “Amending the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Order of Succession in the Department of Homeland Security” (“April 2019 Order”). (Decl. of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Juliana Blackwell, “Blackwell Decl.,” Dkt. No. 61-1 ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)  That order placed the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) as the third office in the line of \nS d nr\nee 17  succession for the office of the Secretary after the Deputy Secretary and the Under Secretary for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Management. Id. When Ms. Nielsen resigned, Kevin McAleenan, the Senate-confirmed \n19  Commissioner of CBP, was the next most senior officer in that line of succession and assumed the \n20  role of Acting Secretary.  \n21  On November 8, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan exercised his authority under § \n22  113(g)(2) to further amend the same order of succession. (November 2019 Order, Blackwell Decl. \n23  ¶ 3, Ex. 2.)  When McAleenan resigned on November 13, 2019, Chad Wolf, the Senate-confirmed \n24  Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, was next-in-line under the November 2019 Order \n25  and assumed the role of Acting Secretary. \n26  On July 31, 2020, Acting Secretary Wolf issued the Final Rule, which requires sureties \n27  challenging a bond breach determination to administratively exhaust their claims by appealing to \n28  an administrative tribunal, imposes a $675 fee to appeal bond breach determinations, and created \n2 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 67   Filed 08/10/22   Page 3 of 6\n \n1  new criteria for DHS to determine whether it will continue to accept immigration bonds from a \n2  particular surety.  85 Fed. Reg. 45,968, 45,974.  On April 15, 2021, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \n3  purportedly ratified the Final Rule. See Ratification of the Final Rule Regarding Surety Bonds, 86 \n4  Fed. Reg. 40,919–20 (July 30, 2021).   \n5  On December 14, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit, asserting that the Final Rule \n6  violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection \n7  guarantee.  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 3, 2021. (First Am. Compl., “FAC,” \n8  Dkt. No. 36.)  Therein, and as a threshold matter, Plaintiffs allege that the subsequent ratification \n9  cannot cure the issuance of a final rule promulgated by an unauthorized official. (FAC ¶¶ 37-38.) \n10  On May 12, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on the limited issue as \n11  to whether promulgation of the Final Rule was lawful. (Pls.’ Mot., Dkt. No. 59.)  On June 13, \n12  2022, Defendants filed an opposition. (Defs.’ Opp’n, Dkt. No. 61.)  On June 27, 2022, Plaintiffs \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  filed a reply. (Pls.’ Reply, Dkt. No. 62.) \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \nrts fo\niD tc 15  A party may move for summary judgment on a “claim or defense” or “part of... a claim or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  defense.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  In the context of the APA, the Court does not follow the \nS d nr\nee 17  traditional summary judgment analysis set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. That is \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  because “there are no disputed facts that the district court must resolve.” Occidental Eng'g Co. v. \n19  INS, 753 F.2d 766, 769 (9th Cir. 1985).  Instead, the Court “determines whether or not as a matter \n20  of law the evidence in the administrative record permitted the agency to make the decision it did.” \n21  Id. The APA permits a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and \n22  conclusions found to be - arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n23  accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n24  III.  DISCUSSION \n25  A.  Jurisdictional requirements  \n26  As an initial matter, Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs have not satisfied the jurisdictional \n27  requirements of standing and ripeness….” (Defs.’ Opp’n at 1, 9-13.)  The undersigned, however, \n28  already found that Plaintiffs have satisfied these jurisdictional requirements, and nothing in \n3 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 67   Filed 08/10/22   Page 4 of 6\n \n1  Defendants’ opposition changes that analysis, so the Court incorporates its prior ruling and finds \n2  that Plaintiffs satisfy these requirements. (See Dkt. No. 44 at 4-7.) \n3  B.  Whether the Final Rule was lawfully promulgated. \n4    In moving for summary judgment, Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule was improperly \n5  issued because Mr. Wolf was not validly appointed as Acting Secretary and the subsequent \n6  ratification by Secretary Mayorkas cannot revive the Final Rule. (Pls.’ Mot. at 1.) \n7  On October 19, 2021, the Court, in denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss, explained that \n8  it was persuaded by Behring Regional Center LLC v. Wolf, 544 F. Supp. 3d 937, 948 (N.D. Cal. \n9  2021), which “found that the invalid appointment of Kevin McAleenan invalidated the final rule \n10  issued, and that the after-the-fact ratification by Secretary Mayorkas could not cure the defect.” \n11  (Dkt. No. 44 at 8.)  The expanded briefing has not changed the Court’s analysis of this matter.  \n12  Even so, the undersigned will briefly address the Government’s arguments, which have been \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  repeatedly rejected by other district courts.  \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  i.  Wolf was not validly appointed as Acting Secretary. \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Secretary Kirstjen Nielson was the last Senate-confirmed DHS Secretary prior to Mr. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Wolf. Behring, 2021 WL 2554051, at *2.  Prior to her resignation, she amended the Order of \nS d nr\nee 17  Succession for Homeland Security Secretary, but she made a mistake and amended the wrong \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  order of succession. Id.  In sum, rather than amending the order of succession following the \n19  Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform, she amended the order concerning who is \n20  temporarily in charge when the Secretary is unavailable during a disaster or catastrophic \n21  emergency. Id.; see also La Clinica de la Raza v. Trump, No. 19-CV-04980-PJH, 2020 WL \n22  6940934, at *13-14 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 2020) (discussing the orders of succession and delegation \n23  in detail).  To the extent that Defendants contend that Secretary Nielson properly amended the \n24  order of succession based on the documents provided, the undersigned disagrees for the reasons \n25  set forth in these cases. See ids. \n26  Secretary Nielson’s failure to properly amend the order of succession, rendered the \n27  succession of Mr. McAleenan, and later Mr. Wolf, to Acting Secretary invalid. Behring, 2021 WL \n28  2554051, at *7.  The undersigned notes that several district courts, including some in this district, \n4 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 67   Filed 08/10/22   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  have concluded that Mr. Wolf’s unlawful ascension to Acting Secretary rendered the promulgation \n2  of DHS rules void. See, e.g., Behring, 2021 WL 2554051, at *8; Chamber of Com. of United State \n3  v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 20-CV-07331-JSW, 2021 WL 4198518, at *5 (N.D. \n4  Cal. Sept. 15, 2021), appeal dismissed sub nom. Chamber of Com. of United States v. U.S. Dep't of \n5  Homeland Sec., No. 21-16912, 2021 WL 8444310 (9th Cir. Dec. 2, 2021).  Notably, in Pangea \n6  Legal Services, the district court characterized the Government’s strategy of repeatedly relitigating \n7  this issue as “troubling,” and noted that, after having its arguments rejected in five different cases, \n8  “[a] good argument might be made that, at this point in time, the government’s arguments lack a \n9  good-faith basis in law or fact.” Pangea Legal Servs. v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 512 F. Supp. \n10  3d 966, 973 (N.D. Cal. 2021). \n11  In opposition, Defendants argue that no appellate court has yet addressed the issue of \n12  whether Mr. Wolf was validly serving as Acting Secretary. (Defs.’ Opp’n at 21.)  This argument is \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  disingenuous, because, as Plaintiffs argue, while the Government is not required to pursue appeal, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  it has affirmatively chosen not to appeal these adverse rulings, or has abandoned its appeals, and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  instead continues to litigate the same issue before different district courts hoping for a different \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  result. (Pls.’ Reply at 10-11.)  Regardless of the reasoning behind it, this litigation strategy has \nS d nr\nee 17  resulted in a tremendous waste of the judiciary’s limited resources. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    The undersigned joins the other district courts in finding that Mr. Wolf was not validly \n19  appointed Acting Secretary and that the promulgation of the Final Rule was invalid.  \n20  ii.  Ratification Cannot Revive the Final Rule. \n21  Here, Defendants again argue that Secretary Mayorkas’s ratification of the Final Rule \n22  cures any alleged defects in the rule arising from Chad Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary. (Def.’s \n23  Opp’n at 13.)  Specifically, Defendants argue that the Secretary delegated the authority to \n24  prescribe the Final Rule at issue here. Id. at 14-15.  In so arguing, the Government relies on a 2003 \n25  Delegation to Deputy Secretary by then Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. (2003 \n26  Delegation, Decl. of Juliana Blackwell ISO Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 39-2 ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)  In the \n27  2003 Delegation, Secretary Ridge delegated certain delineated responsibilities including “[a]cting \n28  for the Secretary to sign, approve, or disapprove any proposed or final rule, regulation or related \n5 \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08897-KAW   Document 67   Filed 08/10/22   Page 6 of 6\n \n1  document” to the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. (2003 Delegation at § II.G.)  This \n2  delegation, however, is inapplicable, because, by virtue of a vacancy, there was no Deputy \n3  Secretary of Homeland Security for which the authority to sign the Final Rule could be delegated. \n4  Indeed, it was this vacancy that led to Mr. McAllenan, as Senate-confirmed CBP Commissioner, \n5  to be named Acting Secretary. See Behring, 544 F. Supp. 3d at 947.  Thus, the Government’s \n6  arguments that there was delegation to the Deputy Secretary, of which there was not one, are \n7  unavailing. (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 14-17.) \n8  Since there was no delegation, the Court finds that the FVRA precludes ratification for the \n9  same reasons set forth in the October 19, 2021 order denying the motion to dismiss.  In sum, the \n10  FVRA explicitly provides that “[a]n action that has no force or effect under paragraph (1) may not \n11  be ratified.’” Behring, 2021 WL 2554051, at *8 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(2); also citing 5 \n12  U.S.C. § 551(5) (“actions” include “rule making”)).  Thus, as is the case here, Mr. Wolf was not \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  lawfully serving as Acting Secretary at the time the Final Order was issued, and the later \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ratification by Secretary Mayorkas does not cure the defect in promulgation.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  IV.  CONCLUSION \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for summary \nS d nr\nee 17  judgment and orders that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, the Final Rule promulgated on July 31, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2020, and entitled “Procedures and Standards for Declining Surety Immigration Bonds and \n19  Administrative Appeal Requirement for Breaches”, 85 Fed. Reg. 45,968 (July 31, 2020), be \n20  VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED to the Agency for further action. \n21  As vacating the Final Rule moots Plaintiffs’ remaining causes of action, they are dismissed \n22  without prejudice. A separate judgment will be entered in Plaintiffs’ favor. \n23  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n24  Dated: August 10, 2022 \n__________________________________ \n25 \nKANDIS A.
