          "description": "MINUTE ORDER denying 59 Motion to Intervene. Movant has not made a showing that she satisfies the requirements to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(a) because: (1) she is not given an unconditional right to intervene by any federal statute, and (2) she does not claim an interest relating to any property of transaction that is the subject of the action and is not so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede her ability to protect that interest. Movant has also not shown that the Court should exercise its discretion to grant permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1), since: (A) she is not given a conditional right to intervene by any federal statute, and (B) she does not have a claim or defense that shares a common question of law or fact with the main action. Also, movant's wide-ranging complaints about the actions of multiple federal and state agencies and judges, as well as numerous private actors, do not bear on this action. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 3/5/2025. (DMK)"

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER granting 116 plaintiffs' motion to clarify 113 the April 18, 2025 order. Given the preliminary showing made by plaintiffs that they are likely to establish that the defendants have not conducted a particularized assessment that the more than 1400 employees subject to the RIF are unnecessary to the agency's performance of its statutory duties; that, with the RIF, the agency will be unable to operate the Office of Consumer Response as required by statute and the preliminary injunction order; and that the planned RIF is in violation of this Court's order as stayed in part; and in light of the findings embodied in the preliminary injunction order that dismantling the agency would be contrary to law and would cause the plaintiffs irreparable harm, the Court temporarily enjoined the RIF pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and its inherent authority to enforce its own orders. This is a non-final, interim order to enable the Court to determine -- on the schedule requested by the parties and based on sworn testimony and contemporaneous records -- whether the RIF is compliant with the existing injunction or not. The order -- to which defendants raised no objection at the hearing -- will remain in place for no more than 14 days, \"unless before that time the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension.\" Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(b)(2). It is further clarified that the April 18 order prohibits defendants from discontinuing an employee's access to work systems as part of the enjoined RIF, but the provisions in the March preliminary injunction order that enable the agency to make individual employment decisions in the ordinary course of business remain unchanged. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 4/19/2025. (DMK)"

The Court notes that to the extent the request for a continuance is based upon the availability of the witnesses, the parties should have sought this relief well before Saturday night. Since there are matters on the Court's schedule that cannot be moved, the hearing will begin at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 29, and it will continue at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, April 30. Given the central role that Adam Martinez and Mark Paoletta played in the events at issue and the defendants' heavy, if not sole, reliance on Mark Paoletta's declaration to oppose the motion, Martinez and Paoletta must each be present on at least one of those dates, as previously ordered. Both sides must file their second sets of exhibits by 10:00 a.m. on Monday, April 28, and they may be supplemented by 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 29. The parties are advised that the Court has no other availability during the week of April 28, and that there are limited dates and times available the following week. SO ORDERED.

According to its terms, the consent order 19 agreed to by the parties on February 14, 2025 remains in effect until the motion for a preliminary injunction is decided. The parties advised the Court that they reached a separate agreement that expires on the date of the hearing concerning the cancellation of CFPB contracts. The parties are ordered to confer and advise the Court today whether they can agree to extend this agreement or an agreed narrowed version until the Court rules on the preliminary injunction motion, and if they can agree, the parties must file by Friday, March 7 at 5:00 PM a proposed consent agreement on that subject. If they cannot agree, the parties must provide the Court today with a copy of the existing agreement. Since the agreement was supposed to extend through the preliminary injunction hearing, if the defendants do not agree that by its terms it extends through the continuation of the hearing on March 10, they must explain why not, and the plaintiffs must provide the Court with the language of any order they would be seeking to cover that period of time.

    "state": "District of Columbia",
    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration's endeavor to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On February 7, 2025, Elon Musk posted, &ldquo;CFPB RIP&rdquo; on social media. The next day, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed CFPB staff to &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; stop all work and informed the Federal Reserve that the CFPB would not take any additional funding for its operations in the next quarter. This action happened in the larger context of the Trump Administration&rsquo;s effort to dismantle several federal agencies and shrink others.</p>\r\n<p>On February 9, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), as the representative of CFPB employees, filed a short complaint (later supplemented), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Acting Director of the CFPB. The plaintiff sought both declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged that the Administration violated the separation of powers by beginning to dismantle the CFPB, an agency created by Congress through its established authority to define and fund agencies. This case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff asserted that Congress had specifically established the CFPB to safeguard American consumers. It claimed that the government's actions to effectively halt the CFPB's mandated work--by ordering the workforce to &ldquo;cease&rdquo; all activity, engagement, and enforcement actions and to close the agency&rsquo;s headquarters--were a direct violation of the separation of powers, citing the Constitution. The complaint emphasized Congress's comprehensive authority over the creation, operational mission, and financial resourcing of Executive Agencies. Plaintiff sought judgment declaring that the CFPB directive was unlawful and enjoining the government from further attempts to halt the CFPB&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 13, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding as plaintiffs the National Consumer Law Center, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Virginia Poverty Law Center, a Pastor, and the CFPB Employee Association; they also added CFPB as a defendant. The amended complaint further alleged violations of constitutional tenets and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). It asserted that the CFPB was planning mass firings and its acting director's actions were unlawful he lacked Senate confirmation.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a limited administrative stay and a temporary restraining order, aiming to prevent the imminent firing of CFPB employees and to mandate the agency's return to its statutorily defined operations. Plaintiffs contended that the challenged actions would precipitate immediate and irreparable harm to the affected employees, consumers, and the broader public interest.</p>\r\n<p>In response, on February 14, 2025, the Court issued an administrative stay order to maintain the status quo, ordering, pending resolution of the motion for preliminary injunction, that the defendants were prohibited from deleting or impairing any CFPB data, terminating employees without just cause, or transferring funds from the CFPB&rsquo;s reserve. The Court stated it would consider the motion for a temporary restraining order as a motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, 2025, a group of 13 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After hearing the issues in this case, the Court <strong>granted a preliminary injunction to preserve the CFPB</strong> on March 28, 2025. 774 F. Supp.3d 1. The order mandated that the defendants maintain all CFPB data, reinstate terminated probationary and term employees, and refrain from further terminations or reduction-in-force notices. The stop-work order cannot be enforced, and the defendants must facilitate employees' ability to perform statutory functions, including remote work access. Further, all contract termination notices issued after February 11th must be rescinded, and while specific contracts can be halted based on necessity for statutory functions, no terminations can be finalized.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Court granted the preliminary injunction due to a strong showing that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and would suffer irreparable harm without it. Regarding the likelihood of success, the Court found that &ldquo;the defendants were in fact engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely when the motion for injunctive relief was filed.&rdquo; The Court reasoned that &ldquo;the defendants are not free to eliminate an agency created by statute on their own, and certainly not before the Court has had an opportunity to rule on the merits,&rdquo; indicating a likely overreach of executive authority. Additionally, the Court viewed the stop-work order as a discrete and final agency action taken &ldquo;in violation of law and without a rational basis to support it,&rdquo; as it halted all work, including legally required duties.</p>\r\n<p>The Court also concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction. The opinion noted that &ldquo;the elimination of the agency was interrupted only because plaintiffs sought and obtained the Court&rsquo;s intervention on the day the overwhelming majority of the employees were going to be fired,&rdquo; highlighting the disruption of the CFPB's crucial functions in protecting the borrowing public. The potential loss of agency data and the harm to the missions of consumer advocacy organizations, which rely on the CFPB's work, also contributed to the finding of likely irreparable harm. The court emphasized that &ldquo;if the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants&rsquo; own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable.&rdquo; 2025 WL 942772.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In response to this court order, the defendants filed a notice of appeal and a request for a stay of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on March 29, 2025. [Case No. 25-5091] The DC Circuit granted a partial stay on April 11, permitting the government to conduct Reductions in Force (RIFs) of employees &ldquo;whom defendants have determined, after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants&rsquo; statutory duties.&rdquo; 2025 WL 1721068.</p>\r\n<p>The government proceeded to announce an intended RIF of over 1400 employees--over 90% of the agency's employees--prompting the plaintiffs to file an emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction; they argued that this large and broad RIF, was not covered by the stay, and therefore violated the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 18, 2025, in the District Court, Judge Jackson issued an order suspending the RIF. 778 F.Supp.3d 144. The court expressed concern that the defendants were not complying with the injunction, citing the scope and speed of the RIF, the apparent lack of consultation with heads of statutorily mandated offices, and troubling accounts of RIF meetings suggesting that the focus was on numbers rather than a particularized assessment. The court scheduled further briefing and an evidentiary hearing to determine compliance but deemed it necessary to preserve the status quo by suspending the RIF and maintaining system access in the interim. The court emphasized its power to enforce its unstayed judgments.</p>\r\n<p>The government filed a second appeal, challenging Judge Jackson's suspension of the RIF, on April 19, 2025. [Case No. 25-5132]&nbsp; The two appeals were consolidated in the appellate court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, 2025, the Court of Appeals panel revisited the stay issue. 2025 WL 1721136. Noting the ongoing dispute as to whether its prior stay language permitted judicial review of announced RIFs, the court (with one judge dissenting) said,</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">we think it best to restore the interim protection of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction, which ensures that plaintiffs can receive meaningful final relief should the defendants not prevail in this appeal, rather than continue collateral litigation over the meaning and reviewability of the &ldquo;particularized assessment&rdquo; requirement imposed by this court&rsquo;s stay order.</p>\r\n<p>To accommodate the government's concerns about the separation of powers, the court scheduled expedited resolution of the appeal, with oral argument three weeks later. The same day, April 28th, the trial court denied without prejudice as moot the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the preliminary injunction in light of the order issued by the D.C. Circuit. The court also held in abeyance the motion to compel records and deferred the defendants' obligation to respond to the complaint until the court of appeals had ruled on the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to voluntarily dismiss the government's second appeal (No. 25-5132, challenging the suspension of the RIF), noting that the order appealed from had expired by its own terms and the appeal was therefore moot.&nbsp; The appellate court granted the motion and dismissed that appeal on May 12, 2025. 2025 WL 1385557.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court of appeals held oral argument in the remaining appeal (No. 25-5091, challenging the preliminary injunction) on May 16, 2025. On August 15, 2025, it issued its ruling, vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding the case for further proceedings in the district court. 2025 WL 2371608. It first held that the court lacked jurisdiction over the claims of the organizational plaintiffs, NTEU and the CFPB Employees Association, pertaining to their members' loss of employment, which must be brought under the specialized-review scheme established in the Civil Service Reform Act. As to the remaining plaintiffs, it concluded that their claims were not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act. It reasoned: \"The plaintiffs seek to set aside an abstract decision, inferred from a constellation of discrete actions, to prophylactically ensure that the Bureau can fulfill its statutory mandate. This theory contravenes all the APA limits discussed above&mdash;agency action, finality, ripeness, and discreteness alike. If the plaintiffs&rsquo; theory were viable, it would become the task of the judiciary, rather than the Executive Branch, to determine what resources an agency needs to perform its broad statutory functions.\" Finding no express cause of action under the APA, the court considered whether the claims were reviewable in equity; finding no implied equitable claim, it held that the claims failed as a matter of law. Judge Pillard, in dissent, rejected the majority's \"constricted view of our statutory and equitable power,\" cautioning that \"[t]he notion that courts are powerless to prevent the President from abolishing the agencies of the federal government that he was elected to lead cannot be reconciled with either the constitutional separation of powers or our nation&rsquo;s commitment to a government of laws.\"</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc in the DC Circuit. Writing that \"[t]he decision empowers the Executive to shut down any agency without congressional authority and shield that decision from judicial review until it&rsquo;s too late,\" they argued that the panel majority had erred by holding that the actions dissolving the agency were not reviewable and that the decision would have negative consequences for the ability to maintain separation of powers and check executive overreach.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "NTEU brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Feb. 9, 2025, to challenge the Trump Administration's \"ongoing effort to dismantle\" the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),\" which it alleged violates separation of powers. It sought immediate injunctive relief, filing a motion for a temporary restraining order on Feb. 13.  On February 14, 2025, apparently based on the parties' agreement at a scheduling conference related to that motion, the Court entered an order that \"defendants shall not: delete, destroy, remove, or impair any data, database or other CFPB records; terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the specific employee's performance or conduct; issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee; or transfer, relinquish, or return any money from the CFPB's reserve funds.\" The motion for TRO was converted to a motion for a preliminary injunction, and a hearing on it was set for March 3, 2025.",

The \nWhite House, Regulatory Freeze Pending Review, 90 Fed. Reg. 8249 (Jan. 20, 2025). \nIn line with these principles, on February 8, 2025, Russell Vought, Acting Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), e-mailed all CFPB staff to direct that, unless \n“required  by  law”  or  “expressly  approved  by  the Acting  Director,”  staff  were  not  to  take \nsubstantive actions that might reflect policy decisions inconsistent with new leadership’s views on \nthe best way to meet the agency’s statutory responsibilities.  ECF No. 23-2.  As Acting Director \nVought explained, he was “committed to implementing the President’s policies, consistent with \nthe law, and acting as a faithful steward of the Bureau’s resources.”  Id. \nAfter  this  directive,  Plaintiffs—two  CFPB  employee  organizations,  three  consumer \nadvocacy organizations, and an individual who has a meeting scheduled with CFPB staff regarding \na program administered by the Department of Education—filed the present motion.  They seek \ninjunctive relief that is breathtaking in scope.  That relief would essentially place the CFPB in a \njudicially managed receivership, with its day-to-day decision-making across a universe of issues \nsuperintended by the Court, rather than by the officer designated by the President. \n \n1  E.g.,  Office  of  Management  &  Budget  (“OMB”),  Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of \nExecutive Departments & Agencies, 86 Fed. Reg. 7424 (Jan. 28, 2021) (memorandum from \nPresident Biden’s Chief of Staff); OMB, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & \nAgencies,; Regulatory Freeze Pending Review, 82 Fed. Reg. 8346 (Jan. 24, 2017) (memorandum \nfrom President Trump’s Chief of Staff); The White House Office, Memorandum for the Heads of \nExecutive Departments & Agencies,74 Fed. Reg. 4435 (Jan. 26, 2009) (memorandum from \nPresident Obama’s Chief of Staff); 66 Fed. Reg. 7,702 (Jan. 24, 2001) (memorandum from \nPresident Bush’s Chief of Staff); OMB, Regulatory Review, 58 Fed. Reg. 6074 (Jan. 25, 1993) \n(memorandum from Director of OMB). \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 14 of 53\n \nIn addition to petitioning this Court, CFPB employees have taken to the streets to protest \nany change in CFPB policy priorities.  Declaration of Adam Martinez (“Martinez Decl.”) ¶¶ 7-16, \nattached as Exhibit (“Ex.”) 1.  Those protests involve large and disruptive gatherings outside of \nthe CFPB Headquarters building, even though the overwhelming majority of CFPB employees \nprimarily telework rather than work in the office.  Id. ¶¶ 8, 15, 17.  Given these disruptive protests \ninvolving the CFPB’s own staff, CFPB leadership has closed the CFPB Headquarters Building and \ntightened staff supervision, making sure that they are focused only on aspects of the mission that \nare, in fact, urgently required by law, as determined by the Chief Legal Officer.  Martinez Decl. \nExs. E, F.  Under this internal procedure, work requests have been approved to allow the CFPB to \nmaintain its statutory obligations.  Martinez Decl. ¶ 21. \nRemarkably, the CFPB employee groups and other Plaintiffs now spin these actions and \nothers as being part of a “coordinated campaign by the new administration to eliminate the” CFPB.  \nMem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Limited Administrative Stay & TRO, (“PI Mot.”) at 1, ECF No. \n14.  But President Trump has nominated Jonathan McKernan—currently a Board Member of the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation—to be the new CFPB Director, and the Senate Banking \nCommittee will hold a hearing on his nomination this week2—actions that are inconsistent with \nPlaintiffs’ view of current events.  Similarly, as Acting Director Vought noted in a letter to the \nFederal Reserve, the “Bureau’s new leadership will run a substantially more streamlined and \nefficient bureau[.]”  Martinez Decl. Ex. G.  The predicate to running a “more streamlined and \nefficient bureau” is that there will continue to be a CFPB.  See id. \nIn all events, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy any of the criteria for a preliminary injunction.  First, \nthey fail to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.  Because Plaintiff \nNational Treasury Employees Union (“NTEU”) has filed a separate lawsuit against Acting Director \nVought seeking to preclude essentially the same adverse employment actions that it seeks to \npreclude here, it is improperly claim-splitting.  Indeed, Judge Cooper has denied NTEU’s motion \n \n2 Nomination Hearing, Before the Comm. on Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs, 119th \nCong. (Feb. 27, 2025), https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/02/20/2025/nomination-hearing \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 15 of 53\n \nto preliminarily enjoin Acting Director Vought from taking adverse employment actions because \nits claims must be brought before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (“FLRA”).  NTEU v. \nTrump, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 561080 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025).  That same reasoning applies \nto all the employment-related claims in this suit.  But this case provides no basis for this Court to \nreconsider Judge Cooper’s analysis.  Issue preclusion and comity principles preclude NTEU from \ntaking a mulligan and seeking an inappropriate do-over before a new judge. \nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed because the claims they frame in their memorandum \nand their Amended Complaint are for precisely the type of wholesale supervision of agency \nmanagement by court decree, as opposed to judicial review of a circumscribed and discrete agency \naction, that the Supreme Court has held the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) does not \nallow—even in the face of allegations of “rampant” violations of law.  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife \nFed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 891 (1990).  And Plaintiffs cannot sidestep the traditional case-by-case \napproach involving review of discrete agency actions by invoking equitable causes of action. \nEven putting aside these threshold flaws, Plaintiffs’ claims still fail.  Their claims that the \nagency is flouting statutory obligations—whether as framed in Count One or Three of the \nAmended Complaint—are baseless.  Acting Director Vought’s pause does not apply to agency \nactivities “required by law[.]”  Martinez Decl. Ex. D.  And CPFB leadership remains committed \nto having CFPB perform its statutory obligations.  Id. ¶ 19-23.  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ claims, \nVought’s designation as Acting Director is consistent with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.  And \nthe Court should not substitute Plaintiffs’ judgment for that of CFPB’s properly designated officers \nregarding agency management.  Nor are Defendants proceeding outside the zone of reasonableness \npermitted by the APA.  Again, their actions are consistent with a longstanding tradition in which \nagencies reevaluate policies upon the commencement of a new administration.  And agency \ndecisions reflecting the ordering of its priorities are committed to agency discretion by law. \nFinally, any finding of irreparable harm justifying an injunction would be misplaced.  \nAlthough Plaintiffs argue that they will suffer irreparable harm if Defendants fail to carry out their \nstatutory obligations, those fears are belied by the record.  And because the public has an interest \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 16 of 53\n \nin ensuring that an agency can carry out its statutory duties in line with the policy priorities of the \ndemocratically elected administration,  the public interest  and balance  of the  equities tip in \nDefendants’ favor.  As such, Plaintiffs have not established the criteria necessary for this Court to \nenter the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction—especially this one. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background \nThe Bureau was established as part of the Federal Reserve System by the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFPA”), Pub. L. No. 111-203, Tit. X, 124 Stat. 1376, 1955.  \nThe Bureau is charged with implementing the federal consumer financial laws, principally for \npurposes  of ensuring “consumers are  protected from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and \npractices[.]”  12 U.S.C. § 5511. \nII.  Factual Background \nAfter a brief period when Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent served as Acting Director \nof the CFPB, on February 7, 2025, President Trump designated Russell Vought to be the agency’s \nActing Director.  Martinez Decl. ¶¶ 2, 10.  Consistent with the Trump Administration’s goals of \nreducing wasteful spending and streamlining efficiencies in the  federal government, Acting \nDirector Vought reviewed the sums available to the Bureau and sent a letter to the Federal Reserve \non February 8, 2025, stating that CFPB would be requesting $0 for the Third Quarter of Fiscal \nYear 2025, having determined that the hundreds of millions of dollars in existing funds are \nsufficient to support the agency’s operations and indeed that the current balance of funds are “more \nthan sufficient—and are, in fact, excessive—to carry out” CFPB’s duties.  Martinez Decl. Ex. G.  \nIn the final paragraph of the Letter, Acting Director Vought stated that “[t]he Bureau’s new \nleadership will run a substantially more streamlined and efficient bureau[.]”  Id. \n  Later that evening, Acting Director Vought sent an e-mail to CFPB staff.  Id. Ex. D.  The \ne-mail directed that employees, contractors, and other personnel of the Bureau temporarily pause \ncertain activities “unless expressly approved by the Acting Director or required by law[.]”  Id.  As \nreflected in that email, Acting Director Vought and others in agency leadership were, and continue \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 17 of 53\n \nto be, engaged in ongoing decision-making to assess how to make the Bureau more efficient and \naccountable.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 19. \n  Acting Director Vought’s arrival at CFPB coincided with a series of episodes of an \nextraordinary and disruptive nature.  First, on Friday, February 7, 2025, a CFPB employee \ndisrupted a meeting between CFPB management and United States DOGE Service (“USDS”) \npersonnel.  Id. ¶ 7.  Later that day, CFPB employees began a protest outside of CFPB Headquarters.  \nId. ¶ 8.  Several protestors followed and questioned other CFPB staff members, making them feel \nharassed.  Id. \n  After the events of Friday, February 7, 2025, CFPB leadership decided to close the CFPB \nHeadquarters Building for the week of February 10, 2025.  Id. ¶ 12.  Employees and contractors \nwere expected to work remotely unless instructed otherwise by agency leadership.  Id.  And on the \nmorning of Monday, February 10, 2025, Acting Director Vought sent another e-mail to CFPB staff.  \nId. ¶ 14.  The e-mail instructed CFPB staff focus only on “urgent matters” as approved by the \nagency’s Chief Legal Officer.  Id. Ex. F. \n  Meanwhile, the protests continued on February 9, growing to a protest of hundreds of \npeople outside CFPB headquarters by the afternoon of February 10.  Id. ¶¶ 13, 15.  \nDespite these challenges, CFPB leadership has worked to ensure that the agency complies \nwith statutorily required functions.  Id. ¶¶ 19-23.  The building’s closure, which has continued to \nthe present day,3 has not prevented the CFPB from performing statutorily required functions given \nCFPB’s capacity to perform its functions remotely.  Id.  ¶ 17. \nNor has Acting Director Vought’s e-mail dated February 10, 2025, which requires staff to \nfocus only on “urgent matters” as approved by the agency’s Chief Legal Officer, prevented the \n \n3 As part of this Administration’s focus on a more streamlined CFPB, the Bureau has \ndetermined that it does not need its footprint associated with its current office space and has \ndecided to cancel the lease for its headquarters building.  Martinez Decl. ¶ 18.  As of this date, \nhowever, the cancelation of the lease has not been fully executed.  Id.  After the cancelation of the \nlease, CFPB will have thirty days to move out.  Id.  The Bureau, in consultation with USDS, will \nevaluate options for alternative office space once the Bureau has ascertained the amount of office \nspace it will need to carry out its more streamlined operations, such as those required by statute \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 18 of 53\n \nagency from performing its statutory functions.  Id. ¶¶ 14, 21.  For example, the agency has \nmaintained operation of CFPB’s call centers and the agency has continued to process payments \nthrough the Civil Penalty Fund.  Id. ¶ 21.  Operations related to the Consumer Complaint Database \nare continuing.  Id. ¶ 22.  Contracts for work related to the Consumer Complaint Database have \nremained intact and operational.  Id.  The Bureau is providing information technology and \ntechnical assistance to enable filers to submit data as required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAct.  Id. ¶ 23.  Indeed, the agency’s Chief Operating Officer attests that he has never had a work \nrequest denied.  Id. ¶ 22. \nIII.  Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on February 9, 2025.  ECF No. 1.  On February 13, 2025, \nPlaintiffs  filed  an  Amended  Complaint  seeking  declaratory  relief  at  the  broadest  level  of \ngenerality; namely, that the “suspension of CFPB’s statutorily mandated activities [is] unlawful[.]”  \nAm. Compl.; Prayer for Relief ¶ A, ECF No. 7.  They ask the Court to declare unlawful and set \naside actions “including,” and presumably not limited to, “issuance of stop-work instructions, \ncancellation of contracts, declining and returning funding, reductions in force, firing of employees, \nand termination of the lease for its headquarters[.]”  Id.  ¶ B. \n  The Amended Complaint includes four counts.  In Count One, Plaintiffs seek equitable \nnon-statutory ultra vires review of Defendants alleged “actions to eliminate the CFPB[.]”  Id. ¶ 80.  \nSee id. ¶¶ 75-80.  In Count Two, Plaintiffs claim that Acting Director Vought’s designation \nviolates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and seek review under a non-statutory equitable cause \nof action.  Id. ¶¶ 81-89.  Counts Three and Four invoke the APA.  Id. ¶¶ 90-96.  In Count Three, \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants lack “statutory authority to require CFPB to cease work on the \nactivities it is statutorily required to perform” and have thus violated 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  Id. \n¶ 92.  In Count Four, Plaintiffs claim that “Defendants’ actions and intended further action to \n \nand those for which physical office space is necessary.  Id.  In the meantime, and due to the unique \ncircumstances involved, CFPB employees performing necessary operations will be permitted to \ntelecommute, to the extent feasible if office space is not available.  Id. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 19 of 53\n \nsuspend or terminate CFPB’s statutorily mandated activities and to return the funding that the \nCFPB needs to sustain its operations” violate 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Id. ¶ 94. \n  Later  on  February  13,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  motion  for  temporary  restraining  order  and \nadministrative stay.  ECF No. 10.  On February 14, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in support of \nthat motion.  ECF No. 14.  Upon agreement of the parties and following a scheduling conference, \nthe Court issued an order converting Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order into a \nmotion  for  a  preliminary  injunction.    ECF  No.  19.    The  Court’s  order  also  memorialized \nDefendants’ agreement that, until the Court rules on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, \nCFPB will not destroy certain records, will not terminate CFPB employees except for cause, and \nwill not transfer CFPB’s reserve funds.  See id.  A preliminary injunction hearing is set for March \n3, 2025.  Id. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.” Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Plaintiffs must “by a clear showing” establish \nthat (1) they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) they will suffer irreparable \nharm without an injunction; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) preliminary relief \nserves the public interest. Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997); Abdullah v. Obama, \n753 F.3d 193, 197 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nARGUMENT  \nI.  Plaintiffs are Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims. \nPlaintiffs cannot show they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, which have \nboth threshold and substantive flaws. \nA.  The Union’s Claims are Unlikely to Succeed Because It is Improperly Claim \nSplitting and Its Members Have Already Been Denied a Preliminary Injunction. \nNTEU has no likelihood of success on its claims because it has already sued Acting \nDirector Vought, in his capacity as Acting CFPB director, in another case that it brought “to protect \nthe workers [it] represent[s] from the Executive Branch’s . . . firings of hundreds of thousands of \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 20 of 53\n \nemployees,” Am. Compl., NTEU v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00420-CRC (D.D.C. Feb. 17, 2025), ECF \nNo. 13, and where it has already been denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on the same \ngrounds that apply here, NTEU v. Trump, 2025 WL 561080.  The claim-splitting doctrine ensures \nthat a plaintiff may not “split up his demand and prosecute it by piecemeal, or present only a \nportion of the grounds upon which special relief is sought, and leave the rest to be presented in a \nsecond suit, if the first fail[s].”  Stark v. Starr, 94 U.S. (4 Otto) 477, 485 (1876).  See Vanover v. \nNCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 857 F.3d 833 (11th Cir. 2017); Katz v. Gerardi, 655 F.3d 1212, 1218-19 \n(10th Cir. 2011); Hudson v. Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., 308 F. Supp. 3d 388, 394 (D.D.C. 2018).  \nThat is exactly what NTEU has done here.  Claim-splitting requires an analysis of “(1) whether \nthe case involves the same parties and their privies, and (2) whether separate cases arise from the \nsame transaction or series of transactions.”  Vanover, 857 F.3d at 841-42.  The claim-splitting \nfactors are readily met. \nFirst, overlapping parties are involved in both cases.  See id.  NTEU is proceeding on behalf \nof the same CFPB workers in both this case and in NTEU v. Trump.  Compare, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, \n64, with, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 47, 52, NTEU v. Trump.  Both cases name Russell Vought in his \nofficial capacity as Acting Director of the CFPB as a Defendant.  Compare, Am. Compl., with, \nAm. Compl., NTEU v. Trump. \nTurning to the second prong, the claims in both actions are for essentially the same \nprospective labor-related relief.  Here, NTEU seeks declaratory and equitable relief to preclude \nActing Director Vought from issuing “stop work instructions, . . . reductions in force, [and] firing \nof employees.”  Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief.  In NTEU v. Trump, NTEU seeks declaratory or \ninjunctive relief to preclude Acting Director Vought from “mass firing of . . . employees[;]” from \nimplementing  a  “directive  to  terminate  probationary  employees;”  and  from  violating  “the \n[Reduction in Force] statute and regulations[.]”  Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief, NTEU v. Trump.  \nAnd it bases its claims for relief on alleged facts at CFPB that are also at issue here.  Id. ¶¶ 52, 60.  \n“It is irrelevant if [NTEU] ‘seeks relief on different legal theories in the two cases[.]’”  Hudson, \n308 F. Supp. 3d at 394 (citation omitted).  But the legal theories are, nonetheless, substantially \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 21 of 53\n \noverlapping.  Compare Am. Compl. ¶¶ 75-80, 90-92 (vaguely alleging that Acting Director \nVought’s actions are ultra vires and that they violate the APA), and PI Mot. at 21-23, 29 (arguing \nthat Acting Director Vought has violated separation of powers principles and that “the agency has \nnot followed applicable regulations” addressing reductions-in-force when making employment \ndecisions), with Am. Compl. ¶¶ 87-99, NTEU v. Trump (pleading two counts: a “separation of \npowers principles” claim and an APA claim challenging employment termination decisions as \ncontrary to reduction-in-force regulations). \nEven if the claim-splitting doctrine does not apply, the Court should not render Judge \nCooper’s adjudication of NTEU’s request for preliminary injunction against Acting Director \nVought meaningless by re-adjudicating the same issues that he has already decided.  Whether as a \nmatter of issue preclusion, see Canonsburg Gen. Hosp. v. Burwell, 807 F.3d 295, 301 (D.C. Cir. \n2015), or, at the least, “as a matter of ‘good sense and wise judicial practice,’” the Court should \nnot condone “inappropriate ‘do-overs’ with a new judge,” Bongiovanni v. Austin, Case No. 3:22-\ncv-237, 2022 WL 1642158, at *14 (M.D. Fla. May 24, 2022) (citation omitted).  At a minimum, \nJudge Cooper’s opinion precludes the Court from preliminarily enjoining Defendants from taking \nessentially the same actions against NTEU members that were in the scope of the preliminary \ninjunction that NTEU had requested against Acting Director Vought in NTEU v. Trump, No. 1:25-\ncv-00420 (CRC) (D.D.C.). \nB.  CFPB Employee Association Has Not Established Standing and Otherwise Fails \nto Show Any Likelihood of Success in this Proceeding.  \nPlaintiff CFPB Employee Association (“CEA”) has not demonstrated Article III standing \nto enjoin Defendants from making employment-related decisions.  “A plaintiff has standing only \nif he can ‘allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and \nlikely to be redressed by the requested relief.’”  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 668-89 (2021) \n(quoting DaimlerChrysler v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 (2006)).  “[S]tanding is not dispensed in \ngross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they seek to press[.]”  \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021).  To succeed on CEA’s motion for a \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 22 of 53\n \npreliminary injunction, it must demonstrate standing “under the heightened standard for evaluating \na motion for summary judgment.” Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. Presidential Advisory Comm’n on \nElection Integrity, 878 F.3d 371, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  But beyond mere allegations, the record is \n“completely silent on what injury, if any, [CEA] suffers” due to the challenged conduct, much less \nwhether any such injury is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  See Alaska v. USDA, 17 \nF.4th 1224, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2021). \nEven if CEA had standing to pursue its claims, it fails to show a likelihood of success on \nthe merits in this case because its employment-related claims should be severed, marked as related \nto NTEU’s claims against Acting Director Vought in NTEU v. Trump, and assigned to the same \njudge.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 21, this Court may “drop a party.”  And it “may also sever any claim \nagainst a party.”4  CEA’s employment-related claims against Acting Director Vought, once severed, \nshould be “deemed related” to NTEU’s claims in NTEU v. Trump under Local Civil Rule 40.5 \nbecause they involve common issues of fact and grow out of the same event or transaction.  See \nsupra at 7-9.  Consider the practical consequences of failure to sever and then relate these claims.  \nIt is far from clear whether CEA has members and, if so, the extent to which those members overlap \nwith NTEU’s members.  But even if some CEA members are not NTEU members, “[s]everance \nand transfer will advance the goals of judicial economy and the orderly and efficient resolution of \ndisputes.”  M.M.M., 319 F. Supp. 3d at 297.  Apart from obvious judicial economy considerations, \nit would be the antithesis of “orderly and efficient[,]” id. at 295, to contemplate preliminarily \nenjoining Defendants from taking the same employment actions against CEA members that, under \nJudge Cooper’s ruling, Defendants may take against NTEU members.  Granting CEA members an \nimmediate injunction would result an irrational dichotomy among CFPB workers—those who are \nnon-NTEU CEA members protected by this Court’s injunction and NTEU members whose request \n \n4 “District courts have broad discretion in determining whether severance of particular \nclaims is warranted.”  M.M.M. on behalf of J.M.A. v. Sessions, 319 F. Supp. 3d 290, 295 (D.D.C. \n2018).  “In making this determination, courts consider multiple factors, including . . . concerns \nrelated to judicial economy, multiplicity of litigation, and orderly and efficient resolution of \ndisputes” as well as “potential for confusion[.]”  Id.  All of those concerns are implicated here. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 23 of 53\n \nfor a preliminary injunction was adjudicated and denied by Judge Cooper. \nC.  Plaintiffs  Must  Address  Their  Employment-Related  Interests  Through  the \nStatutory Scheme Congress Established. \n  This case primarily involves a challenge to policy decisions governing federal employees.  \nSee, e.g., PI Mot. at 32-34.  The Court lacks jurisdiction over these claims because Congress has \nestablished a detailed statutory scheme for adjudicating disputes related to federal employment \nunder the Federal Service Labor–Management Relations Statute (“FSL-MRS”) and the Civil \nService  Reform  Act  (“CSRA”),  and  Plaintiffs’  claims  must  be  adjudicated  through  this \nadministrative process. “Within constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal \ncourts have jurisdiction to consider.”  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 212 (2007).  Although \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction over civil actions arising under federal law, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n“Congress may preclude district court jurisdiction by establishing an alternative statutory scheme \nfor administrative and judicial review.”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump (“AFGE”), \n929 F.3d 748, 754 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Here, as detailed below, Congress has precluded district court \njurisdiction for the claims brought by Plaintiffs on behalf of CFPB employees. \n  Congress has established a detailed statutory scheme for adjudicating disputes that arise in \nthe sphere of federal employment for civil servants.  The FSL-MRS and the CSRA, of which the \nFSL-MRS is a part, together provide a comprehensive “scheme of administrative and judicial \nreview” for resolving both disputes between employees and their federal employers and disputes \nbetween unions representing those employees and their federal employers.  AFGE, 929 F.3d 748, \n752 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (regarding FSL-MRS); see Graham v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 931, 933 (D.C. Cir. \n2004) (regarding CSRA more broadly).  In these statutes, Congress provided that most federal \nlabor and employment disputes must first be administratively exhausted before the employing \nagency and the applicable administrative review board—either the Merit Systems Protection Board \n(“MSPB”) for employment disputes or the FLRA for labor disputes.  Judicial review, if any, is \ngenerally available only following the exhaustion of administrative review.  See AFGE, 929 F.3d \nat 752 (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7123(a), (c)); Graham, 358 F.3d at 934 (citing United States v. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 24 of 53\n \nFausto, 484 U.S. 439, 448–50 (1988)); see also 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b) (providing for judicial review \nin the Federal Circuit or other court of appeals). \n  Statutory schemes like these largely preclude jurisdiction in the district courts, either \naltogether or prior to the completion of jurisdictional administrative exhaustion requirements.  \nAFGE, 929 F.3d at 754. In AFGE, the D.C. Circuit applied the “two-step framework set forth in \nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994),” to conclude that the union plaintiffs in \nthat case could not challenge in district court three executive orders related to federal employment.  \nAFGE, 929 F.3d at 754.  Under that framework, district courts lack jurisdiction over suits like this \none when the intent for exclusive review in the court of appeals is “fairly discernible in the \nstatutory scheme,” and “the litigant’s claims are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed \nwithin [the] statutory structure.”  See AFGE, 929 F.3d at 754 (citations omitted). \n   Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the CSRA provides the exclusive \nmeans of redressing employment disputes involving federal employees, see Fausto, 484 U.S. at \n455, even when those disputes involve constitutional claims.  See Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, 567 \nU.S. 1, 10-15 (2012).  Likewise, the D.C. Circuit has repeatedly recognized that the FSL-MRS and \nthe CSRA readily satisfy the first prong of the Thunder Basin framework.  See AFGE, 929 F.3d at \n755 (concluding that union plaintiffs could not challenge in district court three executive orders \nrelated to federal employment); Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  In other \nwords, Congress intended to make the FSL-MRS and CSRA the exclusive scheme, and they satisfy \nthe first step of the two-step Thunder Basin framework. \n   Plaintiffs’ claims are also the type to be challenged through this statutory structure. In fact, \n“[c]laims ‘will be found to fall outside of the scope of a special statutory scheme in only limited \ncircumstances, when (1) a finding of preclusion might foreclose all meaningful judicial review; \n(2) the claim[s] [are] wholly collateral to the statutory review provisions; and (3) the claims are \nbeyond the expertise of the agency.’”  AFGE, 929 F.3d at 755 (quoting Arch Coal, Inc. v. Acosta, \n888 F.3d 493, 500 (D.C. Cir. 2018)). \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 25 of 53\n \n  Here, all three factors point toward preclusion of Plaintiffs’ claims.  First, a finding of \npreclusion will not thwart meaningful judicial review.  In essence, Plaintiffs are challenging the \nlack of work assigned to some CFPB employees and the dismissal or potential dismissal of others, \nand perceived consequences or incidental effects that will flow from those employment decisions, \nwhether  related  to  financial  benefits  to  the  employees  and  third  parties  or  to  continued \nemployment.  But such employment disputes can be challenged under the CSRA or FSL-MRS.  \nCf. Ghaly v. USDA, 228 F. Supp. 2d 283 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (plaintiff challenging his transfer to \npaid-administrative leave needed to exhaust administrative remedies).  In particular, the negotiated \nCollective  Bargaining  Agreement  between  NTEU’s  CFPB  workers  and  the  agency  has  an \nestablished grievance procedure for determining whether the Agency violated, misinterpreted, or \nmisapplied laws, rules, or regulations in setting conditions of employment.  See Collective \nBargaining Agreement Between CFPB and NTEU Chapter 335, Art. 21, Art. 43, Nov. 8, 2024, \nattached as Ex. 2.  If dissatisfied with the decision by the employing agency and the applicable \nadministrative review board, CFPB employees still have the opportunity for judicial review in a \ncourt of appeals.  See AFGE, 929 F.3d at 752 (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7123(a), (c)); Graham, 358 \nF.3d at 934 (citing Fausto, 484 U.S. at 448–50); see also 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b) (providing for judicial \nreview in the Federal Circuit or other court of appeals). \n  For similar reasons, Plaintiffs’ challenges are also not “wholly collateral” to the statutory \nreview provisions.  Rather, their claims may arise in the context of a specific labor dispute, as set \nforth  above.    See  AFGE,  929  F.3d  at  759–60  (“This  consideration  is  ‘related’  to  whether \n‘meaningful judicial review’ is available, and the two considerations are sometimes analyzed \ntogether.” (quoting Jarkesy v. SEC, 803 F.3d 9, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2015)). \nFinally, Plaintiff’s claims are precisely within the FLRA’s expertise.  The FLRA is—\ntogether with the MSPB—the federal authority on matters of federal employment and labor \nrelations.  E.g., Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms v. FLRA, 464 U.S. 89, 97 (1983).  Even \nif clothed in constitutional and APA garb, Plaintiffs’ claims are nonetheless subject to the CSRA \nand FSL-MRS.  On this point, AFGE v. Trump is instructive.  The district court characterized the \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 26 of 53\n \nclaims there as involving “separation-of-powers issues” and “whether a statute or the Constitution \nhas authorized the President to act in a particular way,” 929 F.3d at 760, much as Plaintiffs have \nframed their claims in this case.  But the D.C. Circuit nonetheless concluded that the AFGE \nplaintiffs had to follow the statutory scheme, observing that, like here, the claims at issue could be \nadjudicated by resorting to the provisions of the relevant congressional legislation.  Id. at 760–61.  \nAnd even assuming the FLRA and MSPB have lesser expertise on questions of constitutional \ndimension, they may well be able to “offer an interpretation of the [statutes] in the course of the \nproceeding that might alleviate or shed light on the constitutional concerns.”  Id. at 761 (quotation \nomitted).  Plaintiffs’ claims are not subject to judicial review unless and until they have been \npursued through the comprehensive statutory scheme Congress devised.5 \nD.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claims Fail Because They Do Not Seek Judicial Review of a \nDiscrete Final Agency Action. \nPlaintiffs fail to satisfy the essential elements of their APA claims in Counts Three and Four \nbecause they are not petitioning for judicial review of a circumscribed and discrete agency action. \n“Under the terms of the APA, [Plaintiffs] must direct [their] attack against some particular ‘agency \naction’ that causes [them] harm.” Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891.  And that agency action must be \n“circumscribed” and “discrete[.]”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All. (“SUWA”), 542 U.S. 55, 62 \n(2004).  Consistent with these principles, the APA does not permit Plaintiffs to “seek wholesale \n \n5 Plaintiffs may contend that they are subject to an immediate injury that cannot justify \nawaiting the administrative process called for by Thunder Basin and its progeny.  But the only \n“‘here-and-now’ injury” that the Supreme Court has suggested permits bypassing a dedicated \nstatutory scheme is an alleged “subjection to an unconstitutionally structured decisionmaking \nprocess,” for example by an allegedly unaccountable Administrative Law Judge.  Axon Enter., Inc. \nv. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 192 (2023).  Here, however, there is no adjudicatory process yet underway, \nlet alone a claim that such a process has been “unconstitutionally structured.”  And in any event, \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  “made  clear . . . that  ‘the  expense  and  disruption’  of  ‘protracted \nadjudicatory proceedings’ on a claim do not justify immediate review.”  Id. (quoting FTC v. \nStandard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 244 (1980)).  The D.C. Circuit more recently explained \nthe Axon Court’s holding in a way that, if it has any bearing here at all, cuts sharply against \npreliminary relief: “Axon at most says that, as a matter of statutory jurisdiction, a federal-court \nchallenge to an unconstitutional appointment can begin before the agency acts.  It does not say that \nevery agency proceeding already underway must immediately be halted because of an asserted \nconstitutional flaw.”  Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 F.4th 1314, 1336 (D.C. Cir. \n2024), filing Supreme Court application, 24-A808 (U.S. Feb. 20, 2025) (emphasis added). \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 27 of 53\n \nimprovement” of agency management “by court decree”—even in the face of allegations of \n“rampant” violations of law.  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891.  “Because ‘an on-going program or policy is \nnot, in itself, a final agency action under the APA,’ [a court’s] jurisdiction does not extend to \nreviewing generalized complaints about agency behavior.” Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 301, \n307 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).  “Consequently, as each case only presents the court with \na narrow question to resolve, [the court] can have no occasion to order wholesale reform of an \nagency program.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs’ claims and requested injunction present exactly the type of wholesale challenge \nthat the APA forbids.  They do not seek judicial review of a discrete agency action.  Rather, they \nseek wholesale judicial review of Defendants’ management of the CFPB.  For example, they argue \nin their memorandum that they are seeking judicial review of actions “including” and presumably \nnot  limited  to  “issuing  stop-work  instructions,  cancelling  contracts,  declining  and  returning \nfunding, firing employees, and terminating the lease for its headquarters[.]”  PI Mot. at 26.  See \nAm. Compl. ¶ 91.  In Lujan, the Supreme Court dispelled any notion that such a programmatic \nchallenge can proceed under the APA: \n \n[I]t is at least entirely certain that the flaws in the entire “program”—consisting \nprincipally  of  the  many  individual  actions  referenced  in  the  complaint,  and \npresumably actions yet to be taken as well—cannot be laid before the courts for \nwholesale correction under the APA, simply because one of them is ripe for review \nand adversely affects [a plaintiff]. \n497 U.S. at 892-93 (footnote omitted) \nJust as in Lujan, Plaintiffs’ APA counts seek to bring a collective, programmatic, challenge \nto all of these individual actions, including actions yet to be taken when the Amended Complaint \nwas filed. \nThe wholesale nature of the challenge is confirmed by Plaintiffs’ pleading.  Both APA \ncounts involve claimed statutory violations, but neither bothers to mention a specific statute that \nforms the basis of the challenge.  Rather, Plaintiffs vaguely allege at the highest level of generality \nthat Defendants lack “statutory authority to require CFPB to cease work on activities it is \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 28 of 53\n \nstatutorily required to perform.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 92.  But addressing that type of claim would \nrequire the Court to supervise all of the agency’s activities and decide what is or is not statutorily \nrequired—an even more extreme kind of supervisory claim than what was at issue in Lujan itself.  \nBut as the Court explained in SUWA, the purpose of the APA’s discrete agency action requirement \nis: \n \nto protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion, \nand to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts \nlack both expertise and information to resolve.  If courts were empowered to enter \ngeneral orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates, they would \nnecessarily  be  empowered,  as  well,  to  determine  whether  compliance  was \nachieved—which would mean that it would ultimately become the task of the \nsupervising court, rather than the agency, to work out compliance with the broad \nstatutory mandate, injecting the judge into day-to-day agency management. . . . The \nprospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of \nagency compliance with such congressional directives is not contemplated by the \nAPA. \n542 U.S. at 66-67.  With those principles in mind, the wholesale nature of Plaintiffs’ challenge is \nalso confirmed by the requested injunction, which is breathtaking in scope in that it would require: \n-  this Court’s supervision over seemingly any claim that the CFPB has violated the \nFederal Records Act; \n-  this Court’s supervision of whether any termination of any CFPB employee satisfied a \n“for cause” standard established by the injunction; \n-  precluding the agency from even considering a reduction-in-force; \n-  reinstatement of a class of employees whose employment agency leadership does not \nview as being in the government’s interest; \n-  this Court’s supervision over claims that CFPB financial management decisions are not \nsatisfying “the ordinary operating obligations of the CFPB”—making this Court the \nday-to-day manager of CFPB financing (even though Congress vested the Director with \nthat discretion, 12 U.S.C. § 5497(a)); \n-  CFPB staff to carry out policies not required by statute and inconsistent with the policy \npositions of a democratically-elected administration; \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 29 of 53\n \n-  the Court to oversee whether any employees decided to take administrative leave this \nmonth and, if so, to ensure that their leave balance is restored; \n-  the CFPB to enter into contracts with vendors that agency leadership does not view as \nbeing in the government’s interest; \n-  mechanizing this Court’s supervision via reporting requirements. \n[Proposed] Order, ECF No. 20-1.  Plaintiffs may argue that this case is nothing like Lujan v. Nat’l \nWildlife Fed’n.  497 U.S. at 891.  If they do, they are correct in one respect:  This case is many \ntimes more intrusive than anything at issue in Lujan. \nEven more practically, a wholesale challenge like Plaintiffs’ is impossible to litigate under \nthe mechanics of judicial review that the APA contemplates.  “[W]hen a party seeks review of \nagency action under the APA, the district judge sits as an appellate tribunal.”  Am. Bioscience, Inc. \nv. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Accordingly, “APA review typically takes \nplace on the basis of a record compiled by the agency” consisting of the materials considered “in \nmaking the challenged decision.”  Cousins v. Sec’y of the U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 880 F.2d 603, 610 \n(1st Cir. 1989).  Wholesale challenges to programmatic decision-making make it impossible for \nthe agency to “compil[e] and organiz[e] the complete administrative record” for the agency action, \nsee Preserve Endangered Areas of Cobb’s History, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 87 F.3d 1242, \n1246 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996), because there is no discrete agency action, as necessary for the parties \nto proceed to summary judgment.  Nor is it possible for the Court to apply the applicable standard \nof review, see 5 U.S.C. § 706, to the agency action.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their APA \nclaims because they are sweeping programmatic challenges unavailable under the APA. \nBecause the Amended Complaint raises a wholesale challenge, Plaintiffs are not likely to \nsucceed on the merits in this case.  But out of an abundance of caution, Defendants address \nPlaintiffs’ “final agency action” argument.  See PI Mot. at 26-27.  “Final agency action” has two \ncomponents.  First, the action must “mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess[.]”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (citation omitted).  It may not be a \n“preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 704.  Second, the action \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 30 of 53\n \nmust “be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ or from which ‘legal \nconsequences will flow.’”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178 (citation omitted).   Confusingly, Plaintiffs’ \nbrief refers to two different purported actions when it attempts to show it is challenging “final \nagency action.”  First, it claims that a purported “decision to eliminate the CFPB” satisfies Bennett \nprong one.  Then it claims that Vought’s “stop-work” e-mail satisfies Bennett prong two.  Because \nPlaintiffs have made no argument that any single agency action satisfies both Bennett prongs, they \nhave forfeited any claim that they are challenging final agency action at the preliminary injunction \nstage.   \nIn any event, Defendants have made no “decision to eliminate the CFPB[.]”  PI Mot. at 26.  \nPlaintiffs’ Bennett prong one analysis essentially confirms the programmatic nature of their \nchallenge by referring to five different alleged actions rather than analyzing how the abstract \n“decision to eliminate the CFPB” satisfies prong one.  Id.  Moreover, the APA does not permit \nreview of an “abstract decision” like this one, even if it is circumscribed and discrete.  See Biden \nv. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 809 (2022).  Rather, only “specific agency action, as defined in the APA” \nis subject to review.  Id.  Because Plaintiffs identify no nonabstract “agency action” to eliminate \nthe agency, it cannot be subject to judicial review.  See EPA v. Brown, 431 U.S. 99, 104 (1977) \n(“For [courts] to review [agency actions] not yet promulgated, the final form of which has only \nbeen hinted at, would be wholly novel.”); Appalachian Energy Grp. v. EPA, 33 F.3d 319, 322 (4th \nCir. 1994) (no final agency action where agency “has not taken any action at this point triggering \n[the court’s] power to review its position”). \n  Plaintiffs fare even worse with the Vought “stop work” e-mail in that it satisfies neither \nBennett prong.  First, the e-mail marks the initiation, not the consummation, of the agency’s \ndecision-making process.  As described in more detail infra at 28-33, the Vought e-mail’s directive \nto pause some agency activities reflects a decision by CFPB leadership that agency personnel \nshould not advance the prior administration’s policies until new leadership has an opportunity to \nreevaluate agency priorities.  That decision is thus “preliminary” in nature and “not directly \nreviewable[.]”  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  “It may be a step, which if erroneous will mature into a \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 31 of 53\n \nprejudicial result[.]” Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 112 (1948). \nBut that does not make the Vought e-mail itself the “consummation of the administrative process” \nreevaluating the agency’s priorities.  Id. at 113. \n  Nor does the Vought e-mail satisfy the second Bennett prong.  Prong two’s language \nincludes terms of art reflecting “a ‘pragmatic’ inquiry that requires courts to examine the ‘concrete \nconsequences’ of an agency action.”  Racing Enthusiasts & Suppliers Coal. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 353, \n358 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted).  The court must consider the “concrete impact the [agency \naction] had on [the Plaintiffs].” Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass’n v. EPA, 372 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. Cir. \n2004); see also FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 239 (1980) (considering whether \nagency action had a “‘direct and immediate . . . effect on the day-to-day business’ of the \ncomplaining parties” (citation omitted)); City of New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 913 F.3d 423, 431 \n(4th Cir. 2019) (“This limitation ensures that judicial review does not reach into the internal \nworkings of the government, and is instead properly directed at the effect that agency conduct has \non private parties”).  And Plaintiffs here do not allege any concrete harm due to the Vought e-mail \nalone.  The D.C. Circuit looks to, for example, whether a plaintiff faces any “risk of significant \ncriminal and civil penalties” for failing to comply with a challenged agency action. Cal. Cmtys. \nAgainst Toxics v. EPA, 934 F.3d 627, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  The Vought e-mail results in nothing \nlike that type of consequence for Plaintiffs. \n  Moreover, in making prong two determinations, courts consider pragmatic issues that \nwould arise from considering the agency action to be reviewable.  Standard Oil, 449 U.S. at 242- \n43  (considering  that  reviewing  particular  agency  action  would  “interfere[]  with  the  proper \nfunctioning of the agency” and turn “prosecutor into defendant before adjudication concludes”); \nCity of New York, 913 F.3d at 432 (considering “incursion into internal agency management”).  \nInterfering with the ability of new leadership—brought about after a national election by the people \ncasting their votes—to briefly pause agency activities pending reconsideration of agency priorities \nis precisely the type of incursion into internal agency management that prong two precludes. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 32 of 53\n \nE.  No Equitable Cause of Action is Available to Undermine the Strictures of the APA.  \nThe fact that Plaintiffs do not invoke the APA to seek wholesale judicial supervision of the \nCFPB based on the “Separation of Powers” and Federal Vacancies Reform Act theories pleaded in \nCounts One and Two does not render their wholesale challenge any more permissible.  Plaintiffs \ninvoke an equitable cause of action to raise these claims.  Am. Compl. ¶ 75-89.  But the D.C. \nCircuit has explained that the Court’s “equitable powers” are just as “limited” as they are under \nAPA review “by the court’s inability to order broad, programmatic reform[.]”  Cobell, 455 F.3d at \n307.  Plaintiffs are thus unlikely to succeed on the merits of these claims for the same relief as \nwell. \nPlaintiffs lack an extraordinary equitable cause of action to address the claims pleaded in \nCounts One and Two because the APA provides an adequate alternative means of vindicating their \npurported rights via review of discrete final agency actions (if those actions take place).  “In the \ncontext of agency action, parties occasionally invoke the principles of ‘nonstatutory review.’”  \nPuerto Rico v. United States, 490 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir. 2007).  This review involves the residuum \nof power that remains with the district court to review agency action that is ultra vires, stemming \nfrom “courts’ use of their equitable jurisdiction to enjoin illegal agency action.”  33 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Judicial Review § 8307 (2d ed. 2024 update).  A \ncourt’s power to enforce the Constitution in the absence of a statutory cause of action does not rest \nupon an implied right of action contained in the Constitution.  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr. \nInc., 575 U.S. 320, 324-27 (2015).  Rather, “[t]he ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions \nby state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity[.]” Id. at 327. \nGiven the equitable basis of a nonstatutory cause of action, Plaintiffs may not invoke it \nunless they satisfy “the traditional requirement for equitable relief that a plaintiff lack an adequate \nremedy at law.”  33 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Judicial Review, supra, § 8307.  See Federal Express Corp. \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (there must be “no alternative \nprocedure for review” (quoting Nyunt v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 449 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009))).  “Thus, if the APA or a special statutory review proceeding can provide adequate \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 33 of 53\n \nrelief, an equitable remedy via nonstatutory review ought not be available.” 33 Fed. Prac. & Proc. \nJudicial Review, supra, § 8307; see also Puerto Rico, 490 F.3d at 59 (“[S]uch review may occur \nonly if its absence would ‘wholly deprive the party of a meaningful and adequate means of \nvindicating its . . . rights.’”) (quoting Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserv. Sys. v. MCorp. Fin., Inc., \n502 U.S. 32, 43 (1991)).  In this way, “[t]he power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful \nexecutive action is subject to . . . implied statutory limitations.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327. \nPlaintiffs do “have a means of vindicating [their] rights without nonstatutory review: the \nAPA” (or, as relevant, the special statutory review scheme under the FSL-MRS or the CSRA \naddressed supra at 11-14).  Puerto Rico, 490 F.3d at 59-60.  Within these judicial review \nframeworks, Plaintiffs may assert their Separation of Powers and Federal Vacancies Reform Act \nclaims as part of this Court’s review of a discrete final agency action.  Indeed, the APA explicitly \nprovides for judicial review of final agency action that is contrary to constitutional power or in \nexcess of statutory limitations.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)-(C). \nThe APA’s framers legislated against background principles from courts of equity and \nunderstood that, by creating an adequate statutory cause of action for judicial review, they were \nlimiting the circumstances in which extraordinary equitable jurisdiction—available when there is \nno adequate alternative—could be invoked.  To override that understanding and permit a plaintiff \nto bypass the APA’s procedural requirements for judicial review would render those procedural \nlimits surplusage.  The APA’s “consideration and hearing, especially of agency interests, was \npainstaking.”  Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 40 (1950).  It “represents a long period \nof study and strife; it settles long-continued and hard-fought contentions, and enacts a formula \nupon which opposing social and political forces have come to rest[,]” and “contains many \ncompromises[.]”  Id.  For example, those compromises require Plaintiffs to “direct [their] attack \nagainst some particular ‘agency action’ that causes [them] harm.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891.  “[T]he \nexistence  of  the APA  as  a  means  for  reviewing  [Defendants’]  actions  at  least  implies  that \nnonstatutory review is inappropriate.”  Puerto Rico, 490 F.3d at 60; see also Coal. for Competitive \nElec., Dynegy, Inc. v. Zibelman, 272 F. Supp. 3d 554, 566 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (“The limited private \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 34 of 53\n \nright of action provided by [a statute] is by itself sufficient to establish that Congress intended to \nforeclose [an] equitable” cause of action). \nNor does the fact that Plaintiffs are seeking wholesale judicial supervision of Defendants’ \nmanagement of the CFPB, not judicial review of a discrete “agency action,” see supra at 17-18, \nindicate that Plaintiffs have no adequate means of vindicating their claims under the APA.  The \ncase-by-case approach required by the APA “is the traditional, and remains the normal, mode of \noperation of the courts.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 894.  Even if that approach is “frustrating” to Plaintiffs \nwho  seek  “across-the-board”  relief,  see  id.,  that  does  not  make  case-by-case APA  review \ninadequate.  See Council of & for the Blind of Del. Cnty. Valley, Inc. v. Regan, 709 F.2d 1521, 1532 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983) (“Even if we agreed that one nationwide suit would be more effective that several \n[discrete] suits, tha[t] does not mean that the remedy provided by Congress is inadequate”); see \nalso Women’s Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d 742, 752 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that \na “generalized action . . . against federal executive agencies lacks the requisite green light from the \nlegislative branch” and that courts “may not on their own initiative create the claim for relief”). \nF.  NTEU, CEA, and Pastor Steege’s Interests Fall Outside the Zone of Interests of \nthe CFPA. \nInsofar  as  NTEU  and  CEA  are  seeking  an  order  to  enforce  Defendants’  statutory \nobligations to administer provisions of the CFPA, or contend that Defendants are acting arbitrarily \nor capriciously in administering provisions of the CFPA, their claims necessarily fail because their \ninterests fall outside the zone of interests protected by the statute.  The CFPA was enacted to protect \nconsumers, not to protect the workers at the agency.  5 U.S.C. § 5511(a).  It is well settled that \nagency workers lack zone of interest standing to challenge whether the agency is devoting \nsufficient resources to carrying out its statutory obligations.  See Air Courier Conf.  of Am. v. Am. \nPostal Workers Union AFL-CIO, 498 U.S. 517, 523-30 (1992); Am. Fed. of Gov’t Emps. TSA Local \n1 v. Hawley, 481 F. Supp. 2d 72, 93-95 (D.D.C. 2006). \nPastor Steege’s interests also fall outside the zone of interests of the relevant provisions of \nthe CFPA.  Pastor Steege alleges that she is entitled to have her loans discharged under the Public \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 35 of 53\n \nService Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program and she had hoped that the CFPB Ombudsman’s \nOffice6 would assist her.  PI Mot. at 17.  But the PSLF program “allows qualifying federal student \nloans,”  not  private  loans,  “to  be  forgiven”  in  certain  circumstances.    CFPB,  Student  loan \nforgiveness,  https://www.consumerfinance.gov/paying-for-college/student-loan-\nforgiveness/#public-service-loan-forgiveness-(pslf) (emphasis added); see also Fed. Student Aid, \nAn Office of the U.S. Dep’t of Educ.: Help, https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/are-\nprivate-education-loans-eligible-for-pslf  (Question:  “Are  private  education  loans  eligible  for \nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)?” Answer: “No. Private education loans aren’t eligible \nfor PSLF[.]”).  Congress, however, explicitly limited the Ombudsman’s role to assisting student \nloan “borrowers of private education loans,” not federal loans.  12 U.S.C. § 5535(a) (emphasis \nadded).  Pastor Steege should contact the Department of Education, which administers the PSLF \nprogram, for assistance; not CFPB, which regulates private companies. \nG. Plaintiffs’ “Separation of Powers” Claim is Unlikely to Succeed. \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional separation of powers claim is barred at the outset because it is \npurely statutory.  In Count One, Plaintiffs cite the Take Care Clause, alleging that Defendants have \nviolated the separation of powers doctrine because they have “exceed[ed] executive authority [and] \nusurp[ed]  legislative  authority  conferred  upon  Congress[.]”  Am.  Compl.  ¶¶  75-80.  This \n“constitutional”  claim  is  nothing  more  than  Plaintiffs’  statutory  objections  dressed  up  in \nconstitutional garb.  But Plaintiffs cannot turn what is otherwise an amorphous statutory claim into \na constitutional issue merely by alleging that Defendants’ failure to act within the confines of the \nCFPA encroaches on Congress’s Article I powers or amounts to a violation of the President’s \nconstitutional  responsibilities  under Article  II,  Section  3.  See  PI  Mot.  at  22  (arguing  that \n“defendants [sic] actions are directly contrary to those statutory commands”).  As the Supreme \nCourt explained in Dalton v. Specter, permitting a party to assert a separation-of-powers claim like \n \n6 Plaintiffs’ brief refers generally to the “Ombudsman’s office[.]”  PI Mot. at 16.  While the \nStudent Loan Ombudsman position is currently vacant, consumers have other options to receive \nsupport from the CFPB, including utilizing the CFPB Consumer Complaint Cetner and/or the \nCFPB Ombudsman Office, which houses five employees.  Martinez Decl. ¶ 21. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 36 of 53\n \nPlaintiffs’ would “eviscerat[e]” the well-established “distinction between claims that an official \nexceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the \nConstitution.”  511 U.S. 462, 474 (1994).  The Court in Dalton thus squarely rejected the \nproposition “that whenever the President acts in excess of his statutory authority, he also violates \nthe constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine.”  Id. at 471.  Plaintiffs therefore cannot prevail \non the merits of Count I by alleging a constitutional violation.   \nAt any rate, because the CFPA does not foreclose Defendants’ decision-making, infra 28-\n30, Plaintiffs’ separation of powers claim would lack merit even if properly pled.  The Court should \nfind Plaintiffs’ claim unlikely to succeed on this ground alone. See N.Y.C. Transit Auth. v. Beazer, \n440 U.S. 568, 582 (1979) (“Before deciding [a] constitutional question,” a court must consider \nwhether other “grounds might be dispositive.”).  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ decision to invoke a non-\nstatutory cause of action to raise this “ultra vires” claim, Am. Comp. ¶ 75, means they must meet \na heightened standard “confined to ‘extreme’” errors.  See Fed. Express Corp., 39 F.4th at 763-64.  \nIn this way, this claim, and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act claim pleaded in Count Two, are \n“Hail Mary pass[es]—and in court as in football, the attempt rarely succeeds.”  Nyunt, 589 F.3d at \n449.  In any event, the Supreme Court has long recognized that agencies can permissibly decide \nwhat enforcement and supervision actions to take, if any, consistent with the statutory duties \nimposed on the agency by Congress.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985) (agency \nenforcement discretion generally not subject to judicial review).  Judicial deference to Defendant’s \ndecision-making about the priorities of the CFPB is especially warranted here, as “the Executive \nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.”  \nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974). See also Heckler, 470 U.S. at 832 (“[W]e \nrecognize that an agency’s refusal to institute proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics \nof the decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch not to indict—a decision which has long \nbeen regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is the Executive \nwho is charged by the Constitution to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” (quoting \nU.S. Const. art. II, § 3)). \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 37 of 53\n \nAs the Court explained in Heckler, agencies are “far better equipped” to evaluate “the many \nvariables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities” than are the courts.  470 U.S. at 831-32.  \nPlaintiffs’ subjective views about how to best implement the CFPA and administer CFPB do not \nserve as a basis for the Court to reorder those priorities itself.  The Government Accountability \nOffice (GAO), itself an entity within the Legislative Branch, has similarly approved of agencies \n“taking the steps it reasonably believes are necessary to implement a program efficiently and \nequitably, even if the result is that funds temporarily go unobligated.”  In re James R. Jones, House \nof Representatives, B-203057 L/M, 1981 WL 23385 (Comp. Gen. Sept. 15, 1981).  Defendants’ \ndecision-making fits comfortably within this Executive Branch practice of short-term pauses in \norder  to  determine  how  best  to  implement  programs  consistent  with  the  President’s  policy \nobjectives and underlying law, and therefore is not violative of separation of powers principles.  \nAs Acting Director Vought stated in his letter to the Federal Reserve, “[t]he Bureau’s new \nleadership will run a substantially more streamlined and efficient bureau . . . and do its part to \nreduce the federal deficit.”  Martinez Decl. Ex. G.  The implementation of such policy priorities is \nplainly within the purview of Defendants, acting on behalf of the President.  In cases where the \nPresident must “exercise . . . Executive discretion,” the duty “imposed on the President is in no \njust sense ministerial. It is purely executive and political.”  Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 \nWall.) 475, 498–99 (1867).  Thus, “[a]n attempt on the part of the judicial department of the \ngovernment  to  enforce  the  performance  of  such  duties  by  the  President  might  be  justly \ncharacterized . . . as ‘an absurd and excessive extravagance.”’ Id. (citation omitted); see also Lujan \nv. Def. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 577 (1992) (finding it improper for courts “to assume a position \nof authority over” the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” (citations \nomitted)). To hold otherwise would itself upset the separation of powers by allowing judicial \nsuperintendence over the exercise of Executive power that the Clause commits to the President \nalone.  See Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474–75 (judicial review of discretionary Presidential decisions “is \nnot available”); Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 170 (1803) (“The province of the \ncourt is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to enquire how the executive, or executive \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 38 of 53\n \nofficers, perform duties in which they have a discretion. Questions, in their nature political, or \nwhich are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the executive, can never be made in this \ncourt.”); Chi. & S. Air Lines, 333 U.S. at 114 (refusing to review President’s decision that \n“embod[ied] Presidential discretion as to political matters beyond the competence of the courts to \nadjudicate”).  While Defendants’ policy priorities and enforcement decisions may differ from those \npreferred by Plaintiffs,  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in demonstrating that Defendants’ \ndecision-making amounts to a violation of the separation of powers. \nH. Plaintiffs’ Federal Vacancies Reform Act Claim is Unlikely to Succeed. \nPlaintiffs’ Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”) claim challenges an unextraordinary \nseries of events: (1) a new President is elected; (2) the President removes an agency head; (3) and \nthe President designates a temporary acting director to perform the duties of the office until a \npermanent replacement is nominated and confirmed by the Senate.  Because that fact pattern—\nand the series of events challenged in this case—are authorized by the Constitution and the FVRA, \nPlaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim. \nThe FVRA allows the President to temporarily fill a role for which Senate confirmation is \nrequired when the prior office holder “dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions \nand duties of the office.”  5 U.S.C. § 3345(a).  Here, the facts are not complicated: (1) President \nTrump was elected; (2) President Trump removed former Director Rohit Chopra from office; and \n(3) President Trump ultimately7 designated Russell Vought as the Acting Director because former \nDirector Chopra was “unable to perform the functions and duties of the office” after his removal.  \nPlaintiffs do not challenge former Director Chopra’s removal.  See generally Seila L. LLC v. CFPB, \n591 U.S. 197 (2020).  Plaintiffs do not dispute Acting Director Vought’s qualifications as a \ndesignee.  He was confirmed by the Senate as the Director of the United States Office of \nManagement and Budget (“OMB”) on February 6, 2025, and appointed as Acting Director to the \n \n7 Again, Treasury Secretary Bessent briefly served as Acting Director.  Martinez Decl. ¶ 2. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 39 of 53\n \nCFPB on February 7, 2025.8  See 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(2) (permitting the President to direct another \npresidential appointee, who is already Senate confirmed, to perform the functions and duties of the \nvacant office).  Plaintiffs contend only that the FVRA does not apply because former Director \nChopra did not die, resign, or become “unable to perform the functions and duties of the office” \nby virtue of his removal.  But Plaintiff’s argument is difficult to square with the FVRA.  \nThe Government’s position is simple: Removal is an event that would render an officer \n“unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.”9  If an officer is no longer holding an \noffice, then the officer is unable to perform the duties and functions of that office.  The statute \nincludes no causal conditions on this catchall provision.  Inability to perform thus means inability \nto perform, whether because of sickness, some mental or physical infirmity, or removal.  The \nstatutory text is indifferent as to the reason why.  Indeed, rather than raising a question of fact as \nto whether an officer is unable to perform the duties and functions of an office, removal may be \nthe easiest case: the officer clearly cannot.   \nFar from an end run around the statute, as Plaintiffs contend, an interpretation to the \ncontrary  would  have  sweeping  and  adverse  consequences.    Accepting  Plaintiffs’  atextual \ninterpretation would leave a troubling gap in the ability to name acting officers.  Designating an \nActing Att’y Gen., 42 Op. O.L.C. 182, 185 n.1 (2018).  For most Senate-confirmed offices, the \nFVRA is “the exclusive means” for naming an acting officer.  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a).  If the FVRA \n \n8 Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, Media/Majority News (Thursday, Feb. 6, \n2025),  https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/reps/dr-paul-releases-statement-on-senate-\nconfirmation-of-russell-vought-to-be-director-of-the-office-of-management-and-budget/ \nhttps://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/reps/dr-paul-releases-statement-on-senate-confirmation-of-\nrussell-vought-to-be-director-of-the-office-of-management-and-budget/  \n \n9The Government’s position precedes this litigation.  See Designating an Acting Director \nof the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 41 Op. O.L.C. 99, 102 (2017) (explaining that \n“an officer is ‘unable to perform the functions and duties of the office’ during both short periods \nof unavailability, such as a period of sickness, and potentially longer ones, such as one resulting \nfrom the officer’s removal”); Guidance on Application of Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, \n23 Op. O.L.C. 60, 61 (1999) (“In floor debate, Senators said, by way of example, that an officer \nwould be ‘otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office’ if he or she were \nfired, imprisoned, or sick.”).  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 40 of 53\n \ndid not apply in cases of removal, then it could mean that no acting officer could take the place of \na removed officer, even where the President had been urgently required to remove the officer, for \ninstance,  by  concerns  over  national  security,  corruption,  or  other  workplace  misconduct.  \nDesignating an Acting Att’y Gen., 42 Op. O.L.C. at 185 n.1.  Plaintiffs are essentially asking this \nCourt to require the FVRA to specify “removal” as a separate basis for designating a temporary \nofficer and to somehow read the catchall provision as specifically not covering removal.  Because \nremoval falls into one of the bases already provided for under the FVRA, the Court should reject \nPlaintiffs’ atextual request. \nI.  The CFPA Does Not Foreclose the Vought E-Mail Given That It Directs Staff to \nContinue All Actions Required by All Law, Including the CFPA. \nEven if Plaintiffs could overcome the threshold defects of their claims, they are unlikely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claim that the CFPA foreclosed the Vought e-mail.  See PI Mot. at \n28-29. Insofar as they are challenging the Vought e-mail, see Martinez Decl. Ex. D, their claims \nfail because they rely on characterizations of that e-mail that are inconsistent with its terms.  The \nVought e-mail does not “require CFPB to cease the activities that Congress mandated it to \nperform.”  PI Mot. at 28.  See also id. at 29 (arguing that Defendants’ actions “are contrary to the \nCFPB’s specific statutory mandates”).  Rather, the Vought e-mail instructs CFPB staff to pause \npolicy-related decision-making to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Specifically, the Vought \ne-mail provides that employees, contractors, and other personnel of the Bureau temporarily pause \ncertain activities “unless expressly approved by the Acting Director or required by law.”  Martinez \nDecl. Ex. D (emphasis added).   \nDefinitionally, directing staff to pause actions unless required by law cannot be interpreted \nto violate the law.  It is plainly lawful for the Acting Director to instruct staff to act within the \nagency’s  discretion  to  pause  policy-related  decision-making  consistent  with  applicable  law, \nincluding the CFPA.  See, e.g., Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[A]s an \nagency under the direction of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s policy \ndirectives to the extent permitted by law.”); Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 406 (D.C. Cir. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 41 of 53\n \n1981).  Plaintiffs argue that “[n]o statute or delegation of authority purports to give the Acting \nDirector or CFPB the power to dissolve CFPB.”  PI Mot. at 28.  But that argument attacks a straw \nman, since there is no challenged agency action to do any such thing.  Again, the notion that the \nagency is being dissolved is wholly inconsistent with Acting Director Vought’s statement that the \n“Bureau’s new leadership will run a substantially more streamlined and efficient bureau[.]”  See \nMartinez Decl. Ex. G. \nThe initial Vought E-mail dated February 8, 2025, had paused certain activities “unless \nexpressly approved by the Acting Director or required by law[.]”  Id. Ex. D.  After extraordinary \nevents, id. ¶¶ 7-14, on February 10, 2025, Acting Director Vought sent an additional e-mail to \nCFPB staff, id. Ex. F.  That e-mail clarified that all work tasks should be cleared by the agency’s \nChief Legal Officer to ensure that those tasks are, in fact, urgently required by law.  See id.  But \nthat administrative decision in no way reflects a determination that the agency should not perform \nor is not performing activities that a statute or other law requires it take now.  See id.  Indeed, the \nagency is committed to performing its statutory obligations.  Id. ¶¶ 19-23. \nPlaintiffs also raise APA claims that Defendants have acted contrary to regulations in taking \ncertain employment actions.  PI Mot. at 29.  Again, these claims face fatal threshold flaws.  Supra \nat 7-14.  But they also fail on their terms.  Plaintiffs first claim that Defendants have violated a rule \nrequiring “60-days notice before . . . a reduction in force.”  PI Mot. at 29.  But they are not \npetitioning for judicial review of any agency action making a reduction in force.  See Brown, 431 \nU.S. at 104 (“For [the Court] to review [agency action] not yet promulgated, the final form of \nwhich has only been hinted at, would be wholly novel”).  They also claim that the Vought e-mail \ndoes not “permit[] putting the entire Bureau on administrative leave[.]”  PI Mot. at 29.  But they \nsuggest elsewhere that the Vought e-mail did not instruct employees to take any administrative \nleave within the meaning of the cited regulations.  Id. at 27.  And insofar as Plaintiffs are \ncomplaining about a cap on administrative leave referenced in Title 5 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations, see id. at 27-28, Plaintiffs fail to grapple with the CFPB Director’s statutory authority, \nindependent  of  Office  of  Personnel  Management  policy  and  regulations,  to  provide  CFPB \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 42 of 53\n \nemployees administrative leave derived from its compensation authority, see 12 U.S.C. 5493(a)(2).  \nIn any event, the Vought e-mails dated both February 8, 2025, and February 10, 2025, contemplate \nthat agency staff will continue to perform work tasks as “expressly approved by the Acting Director \nor required by law[.]”  Martinez Decl. Ex. D.  See id. ¶¶ 19-23. \nJ.  As Part of Defendants’ Ongoing Decision-Making, Defendants Have Made and \nAre Making Reasonable Judgments that are, In Any Event, Committed to Agency \nDiscretion by Law. \nPlaintiffs are likewise unlikely to succeed on the merits of their arbitrary and capricious \nclaim, which, as briefed, involves actions committed to agency discretion by law.  “Judicial review \nunder [the arbitrary and capricious] standard is deferential, and a court may not substitute its own \npolicy judgment for that of the agency.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 \n(2021).    Rather,  the  Court  must  ensure  “that  the  agency  has  acted  within  a  zone  of \nreasonableness[.]”  Id.  “[R]eview under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ tag line . . . encompasses a \nrange of levels of deference to the agency,” Am. Horse Prot. Ass’n v. Lyng, 812 F.2d 1, 4-5 (D.C. \nCir. 1987), and agency action regarding reallocation of resources and reorganizing of enforcement \npriorities after a change in presidential administrations, if reviewable at all, must be afforded highly \ndeferential rational basis review, cf. Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 191, 193 (1993) (noting that, absent \na statutory directive to the contrary, an agency has unreviewable “capacity to adapt to changing \ncircumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or \ndesirable way.”). \nAgain, incoming Presidents of both parties have routinely issued directives that pause \npolicy-related  decision-making,  to  allow  the  reevaluation  of  those  policies  that  were  under \nconsideration or under development but not finalized by the prior administration.  E.g., 86 Fed. \nReg. 7424 (Jan. 28, 2021) (memorandum by President Biden’s Chief of Staff); 82 Fed. Reg. 8346 \n(Jan. 24, 2017) (memorandum from President Trump’s Chief of Staff); 74 Fed. Reg. 4435 (Jan. 26, \n2009); 66 Fed. Reg. 7702 (Jan. 24, 2001); 58 Fed. Reg. 6074 (Jan. 25, 1993).  Consistent with this \npractice, President Trump issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2025, freezing regulatory \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 43 of 53\n \nactions so that new agency leadership may reevaluate the agency’s policies.  90 Fed. Reg. 8249 \n(Jan. 20, 2025). \nIn line with these principles, on February 8, 2025, Acting Director Vought messaged all \nCFPB staff, directing that, “unless required by law,” CFPB personnel were not to take regulatory \nactions, open new instigations into regulatory entities, enter into settlements, or take other actions \nthat could represent policy decisions inconsistent with new leadership’s views on the most \ndesirable way for CFPB to meet its statutory responsibilities.  Martinez Decl. Ex. D.  As Acting \nDirector Vought explained, he was “committed to implementing the President’s policies, consistent \nwith the law, and acting as a faithful steward of the Bureau’s resources.”  Id.  The directed pause \npermits new leadership to “evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration[.]”  \nNat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, 682 F.3d 1032, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  The \npause in no way authorized CFPB personnel to abandon the agency’s statutory obligations.  See \nMartinez Decl. Ex. D (“unless expressly approved by the Acting Director or required by law”). \nPlaintiffs bear the burden of showing that the Vought e-mail is arbitrary and capricious.  \nCity of Olmsted Falls v. FAA, 292 F.3d 261, 271 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  But they come nowhere close \nto meeting that burden.  Their argument that “the CFPB has provided no reasoned explanation . . . . \nfor its decision to stop all work and deprive the public of the services that Congress mandated,” PI \nMot. at 30, reflects a fundamental “lack of understanding” of “the nature” of the Vought e-mail, \nVt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).  Again, \nthe Vought e-mail does not direct the stoppage of all work.  Rather, it temporarily pauses only \ndecision-making that is not “approved by the Acting Director or required by law.”  Martinez Decl. \nEx. D.  A separate e-mail issued on February 10, 2025—after the events described in the Martinez \nDeclaration—clarified that all work tasks should be cleared by the agency’s Chief Legal Officer \nto ensure that those tasks are, in fact, urgently required by law. See Id. Ex. F.  But this internal \noversight check in no way “deprive[s] the public of the services that Congress mandated.”  See PI \nMot. at 30.  Rather, it merely requires staff to clear their work with the Chief Legal Officer to make \nsure that it is, in fact, work that Congress mandated continue to occur now.  Martinez Decl. Ex. F.  \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 44 of 53\n \nIndeed, the CFPB is committed to performing its statutory obligations and work requests have \nbeen approved to allow the CFPB to maintain its operations required by statute.  Id. ¶ 21.  This \ntype of internal check on agency staff is traditionally left to an agency’s unreviewable discretion.  \nSee Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 524 (explaining that the Supreme “Court has for more than four decades \nemphasized that” even outward facing “procedures [are] basically to be left within the discretion \nof the agencies to which Congress had confided the responsibility for substantive judgments”).  \nCourts lack the power to “dictat[e] to the agency the methods [and] procedures” the agency must \nuse to complete its statutory obligations.  Id. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 \n(1947)).  To override these principles and enjoin agency leadership from exercising procedural \ncontrol over its own staff to ensure that staff is carrying out statutory obligations or otherwise \nexercising agency leadership’s policies would be an extraordinary violation of the separation of \npowers. \nAt bottom, the e-mails from February 8, 2025, and from February 10, 2025, incorporate \nthe type of actions that are “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  “In \ndetermining whether a matter has been committed solely to agency discretion, [courts] consider \nboth the nature of the administration action at issue and the language and the structure of the statute \nthat supplies the applicable legal standards for reviewing that action.”  Drake v. FAA, 291 F.3d 59, \n70 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Here, each factor shows that Defendants’ managerial decisions reflected in \nthe aforementioned e-mails are committed to agency discretion.   \nFirst, these decisions fit neatly among those “categories of administrative decisions that \ncourts traditionally have regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191-\n92 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701).  A temporary pause on policy-related decision-making to permit new \nagency leadership an opportunity to evaluate agency priorities in light of the philosophy of the \nnew administration is in the nature of other actions that courts have traditionally found committed \nto agency discretion by law.  After all, the very point of the pause is to give new agency leadership \nan opportunity to reorient any ongoing agency decision-making so that the CFPB “meet[s] its \nstatutory responsibilities in what [the new administration] sees as the most effective or desirable \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 45 of 53\n \nway.”  Id. at 192.  “[A]n agency’s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or \ncriminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Heckler, \n470 U.S. at 831.  The Vought e-mail reflects new agency leadership’s effort to determine whether \nongoing agency actions “best first the agency’s overall policies” under new leadership and \n“whether agency resources are best spent on” current projects or whether they would be better \nspent differently.  Id. at 831.  “The agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the \nmany variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.”  Id. at 831-32. \nSecond, Plaintiffs can point to no particular statute limiting the agency’s inherent discretion \nto pause policy-related decision-making while the agency reorients its priorities or precluding the \nagency from requiring projects to be cleared by the Chief Legal Officer.  Again, agencies generally \nhave broad discretion to fashion internal procedures for formulating policies and implementing a \nstatute.  See Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 543.  \nThe aforementioned e-mails include only a cursory explanation—unsurprising given the \ntraditionally unreviewable nature of the decisions they reflect.  But even if this Court were to \nconclude that the explanation provided is insufficient for judicial review, that would in no way \njustify a preliminary injunction precluding new agency leadership from continuing the brief pause \nand instead authorizing CFPB staff to expend agency resources pursuing violations that may not \n“fit[] the agency’s overall policies[.]”  Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831.  Rather, “the proper course” would \nbe “to remand to the agency for additional . . . explanation,” not any type of injunction.  Fla. Power \n& Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). \nII.  Plaintiffs Do Not Face Irreparable Harm Justifying Extraordinary Relief. \nThe D.C. Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  The moving party must demonstrate \nan injury “both certain and great” and “of such imminence that there is a ‘clear and present’ need \nfor equitable relief in order to prevent irreparable harm.”  Id. (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. Regul. \nComm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The injury must also “be beyond remediation,” \nmeaning that the possibility of corrective relief “at a later date . . . weighs heavily against a claim \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 46 of 53\n \nof irreparable harm.”  Id. at 297–98.  The mere fact that a complaint alleges a violation of a \nconstitutional right does not automatically demonstrate an irreparable injury.  Ayele v. Dist. of \nColumbia, 704 F. Supp. 3d 231, 239 (D.D.C. 2023) (“[T]here is no per se rule that the violation of \nany constitutional right is inherently irreparable.”). \nPlaintiffs’ alleged harm does not satisfy the D.C. Circuit’s requirement that the harm be \nboth certain and great, as well as beyond remediation.  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297.  Plaintiffs \nfirst claim that the stop work directive and dismissal of some CFPB employees constitutes an \nirreparable injury “to employees and the organizations that represent them.”  PI Mot. at 32.  But \ntypically, employment decisions, even up to a loss of employment, are only irreparable in \n“genuinely extraordinary situation[s].”  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 & n.68 (1974).  Loss \nof income or reputation are not such extraordinary situations.  See id. at 89–92; see also id. at 92 \nn.68 (declining “to define in advance of their occurrence” what might constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, but ruling out “insufficiency of savings or difficulties in immediately obtaining \nother employment . . . however severely they may affect a particular individual”).  And this case \ndoes not present such a situation; the employees at issue here have merely been told to stop work \non their current assignments, or in some cases dismissed from their roles.  See, e.g., Farris v. Rice, \n453 F. Supp. 2d 76, 79–80 (D.D.C. 2006) (“[C]ases are legion holding that loss of employment \ndoes not constitute irreparable injury”).  Their “fear” that they may be dismissed at some point in \nthe future or that their personal information will be leaked to the public, PI Mot. at 33, falls short \nof alleging a fairly traceable concrete and particularized injury for purposes of Article III standing, \nlet alone an imminent irreparable harm that is both “certain and great,” as required to meet the \n“high standard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297 \n(quoting Wis. Gas Co. 758 F.2d at 674).  See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 416 \n(2013) (plaintiffs “cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on \ntheir fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending”).  And a stop work directive \nitself cannot present irreparable injury, especially where any incidental harms employees and their \nunions face from this action can be redressed through the CSRA.  See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 47 of 53\n \nn.68; supra 11-14. \nThe consumer-orientated Plaintiffs’ allegations of irreparable harm, based on the alleged \n“halt to the Bureau’s performance of its statutory functions,” fare no better. PI Mot. at 32.  First, \nand again, there mere fact that agency leadership must review and approve work to make sure that \nit is consistent with the agency’s statutory obligations does not mean that CFPB is not performing \nstatutory functions.  The Bureau is committed to performing its statutory obligations.  Martinez \nDecl. ¶¶ 19-23.  “[E]xpenditure[s] based on a nonparanoid fear” to the contrary are insufficient.  \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 416. \nIn any event, consistent with the “characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary \nremedy,” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22, “[a] prospective injury that is sufficient to establish standing . . . \ndoes not necessarily satisfy the more demanding burden of demonstrating irreparable injury.”  Cal. \nAss’n of Priv. Postsecondary Schs. v. Devos, 344 F. Supp. 3d 158, 170 (D.D.C. 2018).  Rather, the \ninjury must be “great” in magnitude.  Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, \n674 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  See, e.g., Standard Oil, 449 U.S. at 244.10 \nThe consumer-orientated Plaintiffs’ declarations are insufficient to show that, while this \nlitigation is pending, they will experience the type of great injury necessary to justify extraordinary \nrelief.  For example, James Speer attests that if the CFPB complaint system and hotline were \nunavailable, that would make fulfilling the Virginia Poverty Law Center (VPLC)’s mission “much \nharder” and would “strain [its] already limited resources.”  Decl. of James Speer, ECF No. 14-5, \n¶¶ 15-16 (“Speer Decl.”).  In particular, Speer speculates that VPLC might “hire additional staff” \nor “divert another staff member’s time.”  Id. ¶ 24.  The CFPB complaint system and hotline are \navailable.  Martinez Decl. ¶¶ 20-22.  But in any event, VPLC fails to provide any evidence placing \nthose diverted resources “in the context of [its] overall finances.”  Nat’l Council of Agric. Emps. \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., Civ. Action No. 22-2569, 2023 WL 2043149, at *7 (D.D.C. Feb. 16, 2023).  \nAnd in the absence of evidence showing that the “expense is disproportionate” to those finances, \n \n10 For this reason, League of Women Voters of the United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1 (D.C. \nCir. 2016), cannot be understood to equate the standard for irreparable harm and the standard for \norganizational standing derived from Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 48 of 53\n \nmore resource-intensive activities would “not justify [an] injunction[.]”  Petroleum Expl. v. Pub. \nServ. Comm’n of Ky., 304 U.S. 209, 220-21 (1938). \nWhat is more, the Supreme Court has held that expenses associated with addressing a \ndispute are precisely the type of costs that do not qualify as irreparable harm. See, e.g., Standard \nOil, 449 U.S. at 244 (“Mere litigation expense, even substantial and unrecoupable cost, does not \nconstitute irreparable injury” (citation omitted)); see also I.A.M. Nat’l Pension Fund Benefit Plan \nA v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 789 F.2d 21, 25 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“Formidable as it is, the cost and delay \nassociated  with  modern-day  litigation  simply  does  not  establish  irreparable  harm.”).    And \nPlaintiffs’  characterizations  aside,  VPLC  complains  of  increased  expenses  associated  with \naddressing  consumers’  disputes  with  financial  companies—not  meaningfully  different  from \nlitigation expenses insufficient to show irreparable injury. See id.; see also Petroleum Expl., 304 \nU.S. at 220 (considering “expense in preparing for and carrying out an investigation”).  Indeed, \nSpeer concedes that “going to litigation” is one of several “other options”—adequate alternative \nremedies at law other than utilizing CFPB resources—that exist for addressing disputes between \nVPLC clients and financial services companies.  ECF No. 14-5, Speer Decl. ¶ 11.  Given those \noptions, it is far from clear that any harms here are truly beyond remediation, let alone great in \nmagnitude.  See id.  Indeed, Plaintiffs provide evidence that any harm will be addressed via \nadequate remedies at law assisted by “the private bar and legal services community.” Decl. of \nRichard Dubois ¶ 15,  ECF No. 14-6 (“Dubois Decl.”). \nNAACP,  for  its  part,  does  not  provide  evidence  to  demonstrate  standing,  let  alone \nirreparable harm.  It alleges that it is proceeding in this action on behalf of its members.  Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 15, 68.  Membership organizations may assert standing on behalf of its members, but \nin order to do so they must show that at least one member “would otherwise have standing to sue \nin [its] own right.”  Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343–44 (1977); see \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494–96 (2009).  Associational standing doctrine thus \nrequires that NAACP “identify members who have suffered the requisite harm.”  Summers, 555 \nU.S. at 499 (emphasis added); see Am. Chemistry Council v. Dep’t of Transp., 468 F.3d 810, 815, \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 49 of 53\n \n820 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that “an organization bringing a claim based on associational \nstanding must show that at least one specifically-identified member has suffered an injury-in-\nfact”).  NAACP fails to do so here.11  And insofar as it is alleging organizational standing, it fails \nto provide even conclusory evidence (which itself would be insufficient evidence at this stage) of \nany drained resources at all.  See Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379; Equal Rights Ctr. v. Post \nProperties, Inc., 633 F.3d 1136, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  In any event NAACP certainly has not \nshown the type of disproportionate and great injury necessary for extraordinary emergency relief \noverseeing a federal agency. \nThe same is true for the National Consumer Law Center (“NCLC”).  That organization has \nbeen serving American consumers since 1969, more than forty years before the CFPB was created.  \nDubois Decl. ¶ 3.  The notion that Acting Director Vought’s directive to CFPB staff pausing \npolicy-related decision-making to the extent permitted by applicable law will cause NCLC harm \nthat is beyond remediation finds no support in the Dubois Declaration, which is focused on \nequating that action with “permanently shutter[ing]” CFPB.  Id. ¶ 14.  And NCLC’s claim to great \nharm sufficient in magnitude to justify an injunction faces similar flaws to that of VPLC.  NCLC \nfails to place any purported “detrimental[] impact[]” on its ability to educate the public, id. ¶ 14, \n“in the context of [its] overall finances.”  Nat’l Council of Agric. Emps., 2023 WL 2043149, at *7.  \nAnd insofar as NCLC is complaining about CFPB’s cancellation of its subscription to NCLC’s \npublications, Dubois Decl. ¶ 7, those type of disputes are handled by the Court of Federal Claims; \nthat forum certainly provides an adequate legal remedy, foreclosing a finding of irreparable harm.   \nMoreover, NCLC’s interests in this case are insufficient for Article III standing, let alone \nirreparable harm.  Again, based on a case that the Supreme “Court has been careful not to extend \n \n11 While courts in this district “disagree about whether a plaintiff-association is required to \nname a specific member at the pleading stage,” Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United \nStockgrowers of Am. v. USDA, 573 F. Supp. 3d 324, 334 (D.D.C. 2021),“[i]n the context of a \npreliminary injunction motion,” a plaintiff must “‘show a substantial likelihood of standing’ ‘under \nthe heightened standard for evaluating a motion for summary judgment,’” Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., \n878 F.3d at 377 (citation omitted), and, at that stage, courts agree that a plaintiff-association must \ndemonstrate that a specific member has standing, see Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, 573 \nF. Supp. 3d at 335.   \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 50 of 53\n \n. . . beyond its context,” FDA v. All. for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 396 (2024), an \norganization may sometimes establish standing by demonstrating that a defendant’s challenged \nconduct  has  “perceptibly  impaired”  its  efforts  to  provide  services  and  it  is  experiencing  a \n“consequent drain on [its] resources.” Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 378–79.  But on the other \nhand, “a mere ‘interest in a problem,’” is insufficient.  Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 739 \n(1972).  This vital difference—between an obstacle to the provision of services to individuals and \nan interest in an issue—is why courts have been resistant to the notion that advocacy organizations \nsuffer an injury when they allege only that their advocacy has been curtailed by government action.  \nSee Equal Means Equal v. Ferriero, 3 F.4th 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2021); Keep Chi. Livable v. City of \nChi., 913 F.3d 618, 625 (7th Cir. 2019); Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 919 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015); Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  \nBased on the totality of its evidence, NCLC’s activities fall on the Sierra Club side on the divide.  \nSee, e.g. Dubois Decl. ¶ 15 (“NCLC will have to engage in dramatically increased advocacy in the \nstates to fill the gaps left . . .”). \nPastor Steege faces no harm, let alone irreparable harm, from allegedly not being able to \nimmediately meet with CFPB staff to address her application for the PSLF program.  Again, the \nPSLF program is administered by the Department of Education, not the CFPB.  Supra at 22-23.  \nPaster Steege provides no evidence that the Department of Education will not assist her with a \nPSLF application.  And even if she did, that grievance would be between Pastor Steege and the \nDepartment of Education, not CFPB, which has no statutory role to play administering or assisting \nconsumers with public loans.  See id.  Indeed, the Department of Education has its own statutory \nstudent loan ombudsman.  20 U.S.C. § 1018(f). \nIII.  The Equities and the Public Interest Weigh Against a Preliminary Injunction. \nThe third and fourth requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction—the balance of \nharms and whether the requested injunction will disserve the public interest—“merge when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). These factors tilt \ndecisively against granting a preliminary injunction here. See Kim v. FINRA, 698 F. Supp. 3d 147, \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 51 of 53\n \n172 (D.D.C. 2023) (“[A] court can deny preliminary injunctive relief solely on the balance of \nequities and public interest factors even in cases, like this, involving constitutional claims.”), \nappeal dismissed by No 23-7136, 2025 WL 313965 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 27, 2025). \nThe public has an interest in permitting the President to take decisive action when it comes \nto setting his policy priorities for the CFPB.  A preliminary injunction would displace and frustrate \nthe President’s decision about how to best address those issues.  Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831-32. \nMoreover, an injunction restricting the Acting Director of CFPB from exercising his \nstatutorily-authorized discretion to determine the amount “reasonably necessary to carry out the \nauthorities of the Bureau” for purposes of his funding request to the Federal Reserve, 12 U.S.C. \n§ 5497(a)(1), would frustrate Congress’s objectives by preventing him from “effectuating statutes \nenacted by representatives of [the] people,” and causing the United States to “suffer[] a form of \nirreparable injury” as a result. Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers)  (citation  omitted).  Because  the  public  has  an  interest  in  the  executive  branch \neffectuating its policies, this final factor tips in favor of Defendant.  The Court should deny \nPlaintiff’s requested preliminary injunctive relief.  See Kim, 698 F. Supp. 3d at 172. \nIV.  Any Injunction Should Be Narrowly Tailored and Stayed. \nFor all the foregoing reasons, it would be inappropriate for the Court to issue relief in any \nform.  However, should the Court choose to do so, “an injunction must be narrowly tailored to \nremedy the harm shown.”  Gulf Oil Corp. v. Brock, 778 F.2d 834, 842 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Here, \nPlaintiff’s requested order goes far beyond that principle.  Not only does such a request fail to \n“describe in reasonable detail . . . the act or acts restrained or required,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C), \nsee Proposed Order at 2, ECF No. 20-1, it also is not tailored to remedying the particular harms \nshown.  And several components of the requested injunction bear no relationship to any of the \narguments in Plaintiffs’ briefing.  For example, Plaintiffs request relief requiring this Court’s \nsupervision of Federal Records Act violations.  Id.  But there is no Federal Records Act claim \nargued in Plaintiffs’ briefing or pleaded in the Amended Complaint.  See generally PI Mot.; Am. \nCompl. \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 31     Filed 02/24/25     Page 52 of 53\n \nAt most, Plaintiffs have attempted to show that they would be injured by the dismissal of \nvirtually all CFPB employees en masse, and by the termination of CFPB’s complaint collection \nsystems.  As such, any relief should apply no more broadly than a prohibition on the termination \nof virtually the entire CFPB workforce and complaint collection systems at once.  An injunction \nthat reaches more broadly would be overbroad if applied for any duration, as such an order would \ninterfere with the day-to-day operations of an executive branch agency were it to prevent CFPB \nfrom assigning or un-assigning work to an employee for any reason whatsoever.  It is a bedrock \nprinciple of equity that “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \n(1979). Thus, the Court should limit any relief to a prohibition on the termination of virtually the \nentire CFPB workforce and complaint collection systems at once. \nParticularly in light of the extraordinary breadth of Plaintiff’s motion, to the extent the \nCourt issues injunctive relief, the United States also respectfully requests that such relief be stayed \npending the disposition of any appeal that is authorized, or at a minimum that such relief be \nadministratively stayed for a period of seven days to allow the United States to seek an emergency, \nexpedited stay from the Court of Appeals if an appeal is authorized. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  \nDATED: February 24, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n \n            ERIC J.

This must end.” \nRussell Vought – February 8, 2025 \n \n“That was a very important thing to get rid of.” \nPresident Donald Trump – February 10, 2025 \n \nThe motion for preliminary injunction to be decided boils down to one question:  should \nthe Court take action to preserve the the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now, before the \ncase concerning its fate has been resolved?  That is an extraordinary step, and before it can step in, \nthe Court must conclude that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims, that they would \nsuffer irreparable harm in the meantime if the Court lets the lawsuit run its course, and that an \ninjunction would be in the public interest. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 2 of 112\nThe Court has made those findings, and the answer is an overwhelming yes:  the Court can \nand must act. \n  The evidence presented in connection with the motion – the testimony of the agency’s \nChief Operating Officer and other witnesses, and the agency’s own documents, produced by both \nsides – showed that Russell Vought, the Acting Director of the CFPB, ordered all employees to \nstop work on February 10, 2025.  As of that date, the defendants were fully engaged in a hurried \neffort to dismantle and disable the agency entirely – firing all probationary and term-limited \nemployees without cause, cutting off funding, terminating contracts, closing all of the offices, and \nimplementing a reduction in force (“RIF”) that would cover everyone else.  These actions were \ntaken in complete disregard for the decision Congress made 15 years ago, which was spurred by \nthe devastating financial crisis of 2008 and embodied in the United States Code, that the agency \nmust exist and that it must perform specific functions to protect the borrowing public. The \nelimination of the agency was interrupted only because plaintiffs sought and obtained the Court’s \nintervention on the day the overwhelming majority of the employees were going to be fired.  \nThat slowed, but did not deter, the defendants. The shut down activities continued for the \nnext two weeks, and it wasn’t until the Sunday afternoon before the Monday when the Court was \nscheduled to hold a hearing that agency officials turned around and announced to the surprised \nstaff that they were supposed to have been performing their statutorily mandated duties all along.   \nThe  testimony  and  the  contemporaneous  documents  suggest  that  those  last  minute \ncommunications were nothing more than window dressing, and that nothing has changed.  The \ndefendants are still engaged in an effort to implement a Presidential plan to shut the agency down \nentirely and to do it fast.  Absent an injunction freezing the status quo – preserving the agency’s \ndata, its operational capacity, and its workforce – there is a substantial risk that the defendants will \ncomplete the destruction of the agency completely in violation of law well before the Court can \nrule on the merits, and it will be impossible to rebuild.  \nIt may be that defendants decided to authorize the resumption of some work and the \nreactivation of some contracts in light of a belated, but genuine recognition that there were certain \nduties that had to be performed to comply with the law while the agency was still open.  The \nmaterial in the record and the chronology suggest, though, that the change of heart was more likely \na charade for the Court’s benefit.  Either way, it’s purely temporary; the Court’s oversight is the \nonly thing holding the defendants back.  If the Court denies the motion for interim relief, the RIF \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 3 of 112\nnotices that have already been prepared will go out before the ink is dry on the Court’s signature, \nthe employees will be back on administrative leave for just thirty days before they are gone, and \nthe defendants will pull the plug on the CFPB. \nThis is precisely the sort of situation preliminary injunctions were designed to address. If \nthe defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity \nto decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants’ own witness warned, the \nharm will be irreparable. \n*  *  * \nOn February 9, 2025, Plaintiffs National Treasury Employees Union (“NTEU”), National \nConsumer Law Center (“NCLC”), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n(“NAACP”), Virginia Poverty Law Center, Rev.

For the reasons set out in detail below, plaintiff’s \nmotion will be granted, and the Court will enter an order to preserve the status quo while the case \nmoves forward on the merits. \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND  \nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in response to a severe economic \ncrisis that gripped the nation.  In 2008, “the subprime mortgage market collapsed, precipitating a \nfinancial crisis that wiped out over $10 trillion in American household wealth and cost millions of \nAmericans their jobs, their retirements, and their homes.  In the aftermath, . . . [t]hrough the \nTreasury Department, the administration encouraged Congress to establish an agency with a \nmandate to ensure that ‘consumer protection regulations’ in the financial sector ‘are written fairly \nand enforced vigorously.’”  Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 205 (2020), \nquoting Dept. of Treasury, Financial Regulatory Reform:  A New Foundation 55 (2009).  Congress \nacted on these proposals, and as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \ncommonly referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (July 21, 2010), it \nestablished the CFPB to serve as “an independent financial regulator within the Federal Reserve \nSystem.”  Seila L., 591 U.S. at 206.   \nThe statute provides that the agency “shall regulate the offering and provision of consumer \nfinancial products or services under the Federal consumer financial laws.”  12 U.S.C. §5491(a); \nsee generally, Title X, Dodd-Frank Act, also known as the Consumer Financial Protection Act of \n2010, 12 U.S.C. § 5491 et. seq.   \nCongress tasked the CFPB with “implement[ing]” and “enforc[ing]” a large \nbody of financial consumer protection laws to “ensur[e] that all consumers \nhave access to markets for consumer financial products and services and \nthat  markets  for  consumer  financial  products  and  services  are  fair, \ntransparent, and competitive.” . . .  Congress transferred the administration \nof 18 existing federal statutes to the CFPB, including the Fair Credit \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 5 of 112\nReporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Truth in \nLending Act. . . . In addition, Congress enacted a new prohibition on “any \nunfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice” by certain participants in the \nconsumer-finance sector.  \n \nSeila L., at 206, citing 12 U.S.C. §§ 5511(a), 5481(12), (14); see also id. § 5581.1   \nAs a result of the consolidation of functions accomplished by the statute, the CFPB is now \n“the only federal agency authorized to supervise the nation’s largest banks for their compliance \nwith consumer financial protection laws.  It also supervises nonbanks of all sizes in certain market \nsegments, like mortgage companies and payday lenders, as well as larger nonbank participants in \nother consumer financial market segments, like credit reporting agencies, digital payment apps, \nand debt collectors.”  Members’ Br. at 13.  “To date, the CFPB has returned more than $21 billion \nimproperly taken from at least 205 million consumers, in addition to at least $5 billion in civil \npenalties made available to compensate consumers in cases where the business that took their \nmoney is insolvent.”  Id. at 12.  \nThe statute mandates that the CFPB maintain specific subject matter offices and units, \nproduce specific periodic reports, and provide testimony and reports to Congress.   \n \n1   See Members’ Br. at 2.  “The CFPB was born out of the most severe economic and financial \ncrisis since the Great Depression.  Congress thoroughly investigated the root causes of the 2008 \ncrisis and determined that regulatory failures were largely to blame.  Because responsibility for \nconsumer financial protection was dispersed across federal agencies, consumers were, at best, a \nsecondary consideration for regulators.  After an exhaustive legislative process, Congress passed \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 . . .. One of the greatest \nachievements of that bipartisan effort was to consolidate consumer financial protection in a single \nagency, the CFPB, that would be a watchdog for consumers, armed with the legal authority \nnecessary to prevent another financial meltdown.”  Id. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 6 of 112\nI.  Required Offices and Positions   \nThe CFPB is statutorily required to maintain: \n  a Consumer Advisory Board to “advise and consult with the Bureau in the exercise \nof its functions . . . and to provide information on emerging practices in the \nconsumer financial products or services industry,” 12 U.S.C. § 5494(a);  \n  a unit that has “a single, toll-free telephone number, a website, and a database” to \ncentralize  the  collection  and  monitoring  of  and  the  responses  to  consumer \ncomplaints  about  consumer  financial  products  or  services,  12 U.S.C. \n§ 5493(b)(3)(A); \n  “a  unit  whose  functions  shall  include  providing  information,  guidance,  and \ntechnical assistance regarding the offering and provision of consumer financial \nproducts or services to traditionally underserved consumers and communities,” \n12 U.S.C. § 5493(b)(2); \n  “a unit whose functions shall include researching, analyzing, and reporting on” a \nnumber  of  specific  issues,  including  “developments  in  markets  for  consumer \nfinancial products or services,” “areas of risk to consumers,” and “access to fair and \naffordable  credit  for  traditionally  underserved  communities,”  12 U.S.C. \n§ 5493(b)(1); \n  “the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity” which “shall . . .  provid[e] \noversight and enforcement of Federal laws intended to ensure the fair, equitable, \nand nondiscriminatory access to credit for both individuals and communities that \nare enforced by the Bureau;” coordinate fair lending efforts with other agencies and \nregulators; and work with private industry, fair lending, civil rights, consumer and \ncommunity advocates on the promotion of fair lending compliance and education, \n12 U.S.C. § 5493(c)(1); \n  an “Office of Financial Education, which shall be responsible for developing and \nimplementing initiatives intended to educate and empower consumers to make \nbetter informed financial decisions,” 12 U.S.C. § 5493(d);  \n  an “Office of Service Member Affairs, which shall be responsible for developing \nand  implementing  initiatives  for  service  members  and  their  families,” \n12 U.S.C. § 5493(e); and  \n  an “Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans . . . to facilitate the financial \nliteracy  of  individuals”  62-years-old  and  older  “on  protection  from  unfair, \ndeceptive, and abusive practices and on current and future financial choices,” \n12 U.S.C. § 5493(g)(1). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 7 of 112\nThe statute also requires the CFPB to have “a Private Education Loan Ombudsman . . . to \nprovide timely assistance to borrowers of private education loans.”  12 U.S.C. § 5535(a).  The \nOmbudsman must “receive, review, and attempt to resolve informally complaints from borrowers \nof loans . . . including, as appropriate attempt[ing] to resolve such complaints in collaboration with \nthe Department of Education and with institutions of higher education, lenders, guaranty agencies, \nloan servicers, and other participants in private education loan programs.”  Id. § 5535(c)(1).   \nII.  Required Research and Reports   \nThe statute requires the Bureau to produce research, reports, and information on specific \ntopics, including credit rates and credit cards, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 1646(a), (b); id. § 1632(d)(3); \nmarket developments for consumer financial products or services and consumer access to those \nproducts, 12 U.S.C. § 5493(b)(1); depository institutions and aggregate lending patterns, id. \n§ 2809(a); and emerging risks to consumers, id. § 5512(c)(3).  And it must make “[a]ll public data \nassets published by the Bureau” publicly available and freely available for download.  Id. § 5499.   \nThe CFPB Director and offices within the Bureau are also required to report to Congress.  \nSee 12 U.S.C. § 5493(b)(3)(C) (requiring the Director to report annually to Congress on the \ncomplaints received by the Bureau in the prior year regarding consumer financial products and \nservices, including information and analysis about complaint numbers, complaint types, and, as \napplicable, information about resolution of complaints); id. § 5493(c)(2) (D) (requiring an annual \nreport from the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity); id. § 5493(d)(4) (requiring an \nannual report from the Director on financial literacy activities and strategy to improve financial \nliteracy of consumers); id. § 5535(d) (requiring an annual report from the Private Education Loan \nOmbudsman).    And  the  Director  must  report  to  the  President  and  testify  before  Congress \nsemi-annually.  Id. § 5496.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 8 of 112\nIII.  Rulemaking, Enforcement, and Supervision \nIn addition to these statutorily mandated activities, Congress gave the CFPB specific \nrulemaking, enforcement, and supervisory authority.  Congress granted the Bureau rulemaking \nauthority, see 12 U.S.C. § 5512, specifically permitting it to promulgate regulations that identify \n“unfair, deceptive, or abusive” practices and establish disclosure requirements to aid consumers’ \nunderstanding of financial products and services.  See id. § 5531(b); id. §§ 5532, 5533.  Congress \nalso granted the Bureau enforcement authority, authorizing it to conduct investigations, hearings, \nand adjudication proceedings, and to initiate civil litigation and refer criminal matters to the U.S. \nAttorney General.  Id. §§ 5561–67.  And Congress granted the CFPB supervisory powers, id. \n§§ 5514–16, authorizing it to examine and require periodic reports from financial institutions, id. \n§§ 5514,  5515,  including  payday  lenders,  private  education  lenders,  insured  depository \ninstitutions, and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets.  Id. § 5514(a)(1)(B), (D)–(E), \n(b)(1); id. § 5515(b)(1).   \nIn addition, the Bureau is required by the statute to report on these authorized activities.  \nSee, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 5496(c) (requiring the Director’s semi-annual report to Congress to include \n“(4) an analysis of complaints about consumer financial products or services that the Bureau has \nreceived and collected in its central database on complaints during the preceding year; (5) a list, \nwith a brief statement of the issues, of the public supervisory and enforcement actions to which \nthe Bureau was a party during the preceding year; (6) the actions taken regarding rules, (7) ) an \nassessment of significant actions by State attorneys general or State regulators relating to Federal \nconsumer financial law;” and “(8) an analysis of the efforts of the Bureau to fulfill the fair lending \nmission of the Bureau”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 9 of 112\nIV.  The CFPB’s Funding \nThe CFPB does not rely on annual appropriations for its funding.  Seila L., 591 U.S. at 207.  \nRather, it “receives funding directly from the Federal Reserve, which is itself funded outside the \nappropriations process through bank assessments.”  Id. at 207–08, citing 12 U.S.C. §§ 5497(a)(1), \n(2)(A)(iii), 2(B) (“Each year, the CFPB requests an amount that the Director deems ‘reasonably \nnecessary to carry out’ the agency’s duties, and the Federal Reserve grants that request so long as \nit  does  not  exceed  12%  of  the  total  operating  expenses  of  the  Federal  Reserve  (inflation \nadjusted).”).  This arrangement was approved by the Supreme Court in CFPB v. Community \nFinancial Services Association of America, Ltd., 601 U.S. 416 (2024).2   \nThe Bureau’s annual budget in recent years has exceeded 500 million dollars, Seila L., \n591 U.S. at 208, citing CFPB, Fiscal Year 2019:  Ann. Performance Plan and Rep., p. 7, and in its \nfirst five years alone, it “obtained over $11 billion in relief for over 25 million consumers, \nincluding a $1 billion penalty against a single bank in 2018.”  Id. at 206, citing CFPB, Financial \nReport of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Fiscal Year 2015, p. 3.  The brief filed by \nMembers of Congress reports that the total is now more than $21 billion.  Members’ Br. at 3, 12. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nFriday, January 31   President Trump fires CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.  See Email \nfrom CFPB Office of the Director (Feb. 3, 2025) [Dkt. # 23-1] \n(“Feb. 3 Email”).   \n \n2   Given that circumstance, it is not clear that the February 26, 2025 guidance from Russell \nVought,  in  his  capacity  as  Director  of  OMB  (“tax  dollars  are  being  siphoned  off  to  fund \nunproductive  and  unnecessary  programs  that  benefit  radical  interest  groups  while  hurting \nhard-working citizens”), has much bearing on the CFPB.  See Mem. from Russell T. Vought, \nDirector, Off. of Mgmt. and Budget, and Charles Ezell, Acting Director, Off. of Pers. Mgmt., to \nHeads of Exec. Dep’ts and Agencies (Feb. 26, 2025) [Dkt. # 70-2] at Page 1–7 of 7.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 10 of 112\n  Effective  date  of  appointment  of  Secretary  of  Treasury  Scott \nBessent as CFPB Acting Director.

THE  COURT  MAY  EXERCISE  SUBJECT  MATTER  JURISDICTION  OVER \nTHIS CASE. \n“[E]very federal court has a ‘special obligation to satisfy itself’ of its own jurisdiction \nbefore addressing the merits of any dispute.”  Dominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1362 \n(D.C. Cir. 2012), quoting Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986).  As \nan Article III court, this Court’s judicial power is limited to adjudicating actual “cases” and \n“controversies.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984). \nA.  The Court has jurisdiction to decide Counts One, Three, and Four. \nIn Count One, plaintiffs have alleged both statutory and constitutional violations, and it is \na fundamental proposition of constitutional law that “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of \nthe judicial department to say what the law is.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 \n(1803).  Counts Three and Four are predicated on the APA.  These are the claims that will underlie \nthis ruling,6 and the Court has jurisdiction to hear them and to impose injunctive relief.   \nWhile the decisions in this case implemented Presidential directives, the President is not \nthe defendant in this action:  plaintiffs sued Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting \nDirector of the CFPB, and the agency itself.  In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579 (1952), the Supreme Court remedied the President’s wrongful seizure of the nation’s \n \n6   Given that finding, and the fact that the relief to be granted will be predicated on those \ncounts, the Court need not address the merits of Count Two, which asserts that the firing of the \nCFPB Director did not create a “vacancy” that could be filled under Federal Vacancies Reform \nAct, 5 U.S.C. §3345, and that therefore, the appointment of defendant Vought as Acting Director \nof the CFPB violated the Appointments Clause.  U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 34 of 112\nsteel mills through an injunction to his subordinates, and that case continues to be cited for the \nproposition that “courts have power to compel subordinate executive officials to disobey illegal \nPresidential commands.”  Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067, 1072, n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1971). \n   In Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the D.C. Circuit reiterated the \n“bedrock principle that our system of government is founded on the rule of law.”  And it explained \nthat therefore:  \nit is sometimes a necessary function of the judiciary to determine if \nthe  executive  branch  is  abiding  by  the  terms  of  legislative \nenactments.  In most cases, any conflict between the desire to avoid \nconfronting the elected head of a coequal branch of government and \nto ensure the rule of law can be successfully bypassed, because the \ninjury  at  issue  can  be  rectified  by  injunctive  relief  against \nsubordinate officials.  \n \nId. at 978 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \nThese  principles  apply  to  cases  raising  constitutional  questions  as  well  as  statutory \nquestions; “the court’s power to enjoin unconstitutional acts by the government . . . is inherent in \nthe Constitution itself.”  Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 190, n.22 (D.C. Cir. 2006), quoting \nHubbard v. EPA, 809 F.2d, 1 at 11, n.15 (1986).

Cir. 1996).7  \n \n7    See also Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491, n.2 (2010), \nin which the Supreme Court recognized its power to hear challenges to the constitutionality of \ngovernmental action on separation of powers principles, citing Correctional Servs. Corp. v. \nMalesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001) (equitable relief “has long been recognized as the proper means \nfor preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally”); Bell v.

Compl. ¶ 79. \n This claim is likely to succeed as there is no mystery about what is going on as the \nPresident and his delegees, Elon Musk and Russell Vought, have made their actions and intentions \nclear. \nOn February 6, officials representing the Department of the Treasury notified the CFPB \nthat individuals from United States DOGE Service would need access to the building that evening. \nFirst Martinez Decl. ¶ 6.  A follow-up meeting was held on February 7.  Id. ¶ 7.  On that date, the \nPresident designated Russell Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to serve \nas the Acting Director of the CFPB, id. ¶ 10; Feb. 8 Email, and by that evening, Musk had already \nposted “CFPB RIP” and a tombstone emoji on his social media site X.

By February 10, the day Vought ordered all employees to stop all work, President Trump \nacknowledged that his goal was to have the agency “totally eliminated,” and he added that “we did \nthe right thing.  The CFPB was a very important thing to get rid of, and it was also a waste.  I \nmean, number one, it was a bad group of people running it, but it was also a waste.”  See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 2, 47, n.14, citing @factpostnews, X  (Feb. 10, 2025), https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/ \n18891320239 33022283?Mx=2. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 36 of 112\n1.  The constitutional claims are not barred by Dalton v. Spector. \nDefendants argue that this Court has no power to hear the constitutional claim that \nunderlies Count One, as it is nothing more than a statutory claim, and they cite Dalton v. Specter, \n511 U.S. 462, 472 (1994), for that principle.  But the holding in that case arose in a situation that \nis not at all analogous to the situation here.  In Dalton, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the Secretary \nof Defense from closing the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.  The President had made the decision \nto do so pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. § 2687.  \nAs the opinion explains in detail, the Act established an “elaborate selection process” that \nconcludes  with  a  set  of  recommendations  on  the  President’s  desk:    the  Secretary  issues \nrecommendations for closure or realignment after he has given notice and an opportunity for public \ncomment; the Secretary submits the recommendations to Congress and to the Defense Base \nClosure and Realignment Commission, an independent body whose members are appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate; and the Commission conducts hearings, resulting in the \ntransmittal of a report and recommendations to the President, who has the decision-making \nauthority.  Id. at 464–65.  The Act then sets out a timetable for the President’s approval or \ndisapproval of the recommendations and the submission of any certification of approval to \nCongress.  Id.  \nThe Court made quick work of the plaintiffs’ claims challenging the actions of the \nSecretary and the Commission, finding that they could not be reviewed under the APA because \nthey were not “final agency actions;” they were simply recommendations to the President, who \nhad the ultimate decision-making authority.  Id. at 476.  The actions of the President could not be \nreviewed under the APA because the President is not an “agency” under that Act.  Id.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 37 of 112\n Thus, the question of jurisdiction in Dalton boiled down to the issue of whether the \nPresident exceeded his authority under the Act, and that, according to the Court, could not be \ncharacterized as a constitutional question.  First, it observed: \nOur cases do not support the proposition that every action by the President, \nor by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is ipso \nfacto in violation of the Constitution.  On the contrary, we have often \ndistinguished between claims of constitutional violations and claims that an \nofficial has acted in excess of his statutory authority. \n \nId. at 472, citing, inter alia, Harmon v. Brucker, 355 U.S. 579, 581 (1958) (“In keeping with our \nduty to avoid deciding constitutional questions presented unless essential to proper disposition of \na case, we look first to petitioners’ non-constitutional claim that respondent [Secretary of the \nArmy] acted in excess of powers granted him by Congress ”).8  The Court then distinguished the \nsituation before it from what had been at issue in Youngstown: \nIn Youngstown, the Government disclaimed any statutory authority for the \nPresident’s seizure of steel mills.  The only basis of authority asserted was \nthe President’s inherent constitutional power as the Executive and the \nCommander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  Because no statutory authority \nwas  claimed,  the  case  necessarily  turned  on  whether  the  Constitution \nauthorized the President’s actions.  Youngstown thus involved the conceded \nabsence of any statutory authority, not a claim that the President acted in \nexcess of such authority.  The case cannot be read for the proposition that \nan  action  taken  by  the  President  in  excess  of  his  statutory  authority \nnecessarily violates the Constitution. \n \n \n8   The Court also cited Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 691, \nn.11, (1949), which stated that sovereign immunity would not shield an executive officer from suit \nif the officer acted either unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers.  It commented that \nthere was a difference:  “[i]f all executive actions in excess of statutory authority were ipso facto \nunconstitutional . . . there would have been little need in Larson for our specifying unconstitutional \nand ultra vires conduct as separate categories.”  Id.  Count One alleges that the decision to close \nthe agency is contrary to statute and the constitution; if the defendants do not defend on the grounds \nthat the President was exercising his constitutional authority, the Court may not need to reach the \nconstitutional question. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 38 of 112\nId. at 473 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).  Applying that reasoning, the Court found that \nthe respondents’ claim that the Secretary’s action was inconsistent with the Act was at bottom a \nstatutory claim.  It held that “[w]here a statute, such as the 1990 Act, commits decisionmaking to \nthe discretion of the President, judicial review of the President’s decision is not available.”  Id. at \n477.   \n              That ruling does not serve as any sort of impediment here.  While the government disputes \nwhether it is engaged in the elimination of the agency as a matter of fact, it is not suggesting that \ndoing so would have been an exercise of discretion authorized by the statute in question as the \nSecretary’s actions were in Dalton.  See Defs.’ Opp. at 28–29.  Nor are plaintiffs solely alleging \nthat defendants in this case exceeded any statutory authority accorded to the agency under the \nDodd-Frank Act; their argument is that Acting Director Vought’s actions to close the agency on \nbehalf of the President violated both the separation of powers inherent in the Constitution and the \nstatute that created the CPPB and assigned it mandatory duties.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 9, 10, 76–\n80, and 92.  \nThere are significant differences between the abrupt closure of a federal agency by the \nexecutive  and  the  implementation  of  the  multi-layered  administrative,  executive,  and \nCongressional process that led to the closure of a shipyard.  Therefore, it is telling here that the \nDalton Court took pains to emphasize that it was not repudiating Marbury v. Madison or the \n“nearly two centuries of constitutional adjudication” that followed; the “conclusion that judicial \nreview is not available for respondents’ claim follows from our interpretation of an Act of \nCongress, by which we and all federal courts are bound.”  511 U.S. at 477.  Since there is no act \nof Congress that empowers the President to shut down the CFPB in his discretion, Dalton does not \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 39 of 112\napply, and the Court has jurisdiction to perform its traditional duty and consider both the statutory \nand constitutional claims. \n2.  The APA claims are properly predicated on discrete, final agency \naction. \nDefendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the APA claims because, as \nthey characterize the complaint, plaintiffs are simply voicing a generalized grievance about agency \npolicy or management, and such claims are not cognizable under Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife \nFederation, 504 U.S. 555 (1992) and Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55 (2004) \n(“SUWA”).  See Defs.’ Opp. at 14–15 (“Plaintiffs’ claims and requested injunction present exactly \nthe type of wholesale challenge that the APA forbids.  They do not seek judicial review of a \ndiscrete agency action.  Rather, they seek wholesale judicial review of Defendants’ management \nof the CFPB.”); id. at 17 (“Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their APA claims because they are \nsweeping programmatic challenges unavailable under the APA.”).  Defendants also pluck one \nsentence from Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 809 (2022), and repeat that “the APA does not permit \nreview of an ‘abstract decision.’”  Defs.’ Opp. at 18, citing 597 U.S. at 809.  But they do not \nsuggest that the holding of that case bears on this dispute in any other way.  See Defs.’ Opp. at 18. \nDefendants’ repeated incantation of the words “programmatic” and “abstract” cannot \nchange the character of what is actually going on, and there is at least one discrete order before the \nCourt that is ripe for review. \nPlaintiffs’ claims under the Administrative Procedure Act are predicated on sections \n706(2)(C) and 706(2)(A).  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 90, 93.  Section 706(2)(C) provides that “the reviewing \ncourt shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority or limitations,” and (2)(A) directs the reviewing court to hold unlawful and \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 40 of 112\nset aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(C), (2)(A). \nCongress specified what it meant by these terms.  According to the definitions section of \nthe statute, “agency action” includes “the whole or part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, \nrelief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  5 U.S.C. §551(13).  The word “order” \nin that series is defined to mean “the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, \nnegative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than rule making.” Id. \n§ 551(6).  There is no question that on February 10, 2025, Acting Director Vought ordered CFPB \nemployees to stop work.  But was that order “final” such that it would be a reviewable agency \naction?  The statute further explains that when undertaking this review, “the reviewing court shall \ndecide  all  relevant  questions  of  law,  interpret  constitutional  and  statutory  provisions,  and \ndetermine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.  Id. § 706 (“Scope of \nReview”). \nThe test to be applied when a court is ensuring itself of its jurisdiction to review agency \naction was set out in Bennet v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997).  “As a general matter, two conditions \nmust be satisfied for agency action to be ‘final’:  First the action must mark the ‘consummation of \nthe agency’s decision-making process, . . . it must not be of a merely tentative of interlocutory \nnature.  And second, the action must be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,” \nor from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Id. at 177–78 (citations omitted). \nThe thrust of defendants’ opposition to the pending motion is that Acting Director Vought’s \nFebruary 8 email was nothing more than the typical pause in regulatory and enforcement activities \nthat would mark the arrival of any new administration.   \nIncoming Presidents of both parties have routinely issued directives that \npause policy-related decision-making to allow the reevaluation of those \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 41 of 112\npolicies  that  were  under  consideration  or  under  development  but  not \nfinalized by the prior administration.  Consistent with this practice, on \nJanuary 20, 2025, President Trump ordered agencies across the government \nto freeze regulatory actions so that new agency leadership may reevaluate \npolicies and enforcement priorities.  \n \nIn line with these principles, on February 8, 2025, Russell Vought, Acting \nDirector of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau e-mailed all CFPB \nstaff to direct that, unless “required by law” or “expressly approved by the \nActing Director,” staff were not to take substantive actions that might reflect \npolicy decisions inconsistent with new leadership’s views on the best way \nto meet the agency’s statutory responsibilities.  \n \nAfter this directive, Plaintiffs . . . filed the present motion. \n \nDefs.’ Opp. at 1; see also Defs.’ Opp. at 28–29.    \nThe problem for the defendants is that this explanation is largely irrelevant, and it is \nfactually incorrect.  It is true that plaintiffs filed their initial complaint the day after the February 8 \ndirective.  See Compl. [Dkt. #1].  But the February 13 motion for a temporary restraining order \nwas not filed at that time; it came after the February 10 stop work order and the actions that \nfollowed in its wake.  See Mot. for TRO [Dkt. #10].  And the February 8 email is not the basis for \nplaintiffs’ request for interim relief, nor will it be the subject of this order.  The Court’s concern is \nFebruary 10. \n Defendants do posit that the February 10 “Vought ‘stop work’ email” does not satisfy the \nBennett test either, but they do that by trying – unsuccessfully – to blur the obvious distinction \nbetween what happened on Vought’s first day at the agency and what he did two days later, relying \non the arguments advanced concerning the February 8 email in their brief.  See Defs.’ Opp. at 18 \n(“[T]he e-mail marks the initiation, not the consummation, of the agency’s decision-making \nprocess.  As described in more detail infra at 28–33, the Vought e-mail’s directive to pause some \nagency activities reflects a decision by CFPB leadership that agency personnel should not advance \nthe prior administration’s policies until new leadership has an opportunity to reevaluate agency \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 42 of 112\npriorities.  That decision is thus ‘preliminary’ in nature and ‘not directly reviewable.’”) (internal \ncitation omitted).     \nThe record shows that the February 10 stop work order marked the end of whatever \ndecision-making process the Acting Director found to be necessary, and that it had immediate, \nconcrete legal consequences.  While the February 8 “Directive on Bureau Activities” carved out \nactivities “expressly approved by the Acting Director or required by law,” the “Additional \nDirectives”  issued  on  February  10  superseded  those  instructions  with  a  straightforward, \nunqualified statement:  “[p]lease do not perform any work tasks.”  The order did include the \ninformation that if there were “urgent matters,” employees could “alert” the Acting Director \n“through Mark Paoletta, Chief Legal Officer, to get approval in writing before performing any \nwork task.”  Feb. 10 Email.9  The email concluded by reiterating, “[o]therwise, employees should \nstand down from performing any work task.”  Id. \nThe consequences were swift.  As of February 10, agency employees understood that no \nwork meant no work.10 See Martinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 206.  On February 11 and 12, all \neighty-five probationary employees were terminated.  See, e.g., Alex Doe Testimony, Mar. 11 Tr. \nat 45.  On what grounds?  The Notification of Personnel Action issued by the Office of Personnel \nManagement, headed by the very same Director, Russell Vought, cited only two sources of \n \n9   As will be set out in more detail below, there were some requests for approval that were \ngranted, but those generally involved operational needs – keeping the lights on and the computers \nrunning, or doing the work needed to effectuate the RIFs and contract terminations. \n10   As of the day before, February 9, employees were informed that the CFPB headquarters \nbuilding would be closed, and the President had already announced on January 20, 2025 that \nagencies in the executive branch “shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate \nremote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective \nduty stations on a full-time basis.”  Return to In-Person Work, https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \npresidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 43 of 112\nauthority:  the Executive Order 14210 of February 11 and “the stop work email from Russ Vought \nEntitled ‘Additional directives on Bureau Activities’” dated February 10.  See Notices of Personnel \nAction, Pls.’ Ex. BB [Dkt. # 60-1] at Page 86 of 107; Pls.’ Ex. CC [Dkt. # 60-1] at Page 90 of 107.  \nIn  short,  the  February  10  work  stoppage  order  had  an  immediate  impact  on  probationary \nemployees’ legal rights and obligations.  See id. at Pages 87, 91 of 107 (second page of Notices \nexplaining the contents of the first page and the employee’s rights).  \nAlso, on February 11, agency staff received direction to terminate contracts with outside \nvendors, affecting the contractors’ rights and obligations, and a template for accomplishing this \ntask was circulated.  Pls.’ Ex. B [Dkt. # 60-1] at 5 of 107; Template of Notification of Termination \nDuring Probationary Period, Pls.’ Ex. C [Dkt. # 60-1] at Page 7 of 107. \nOn February 12, with the probationary and term employees out of the way, the CFBP \nentered into an agreement with OPM to receive “RIF Assistance.”  Pls.’ Ex. II [Dkt. # 66-1] at \nPage 3 of 60.  The objective was to fire approximately 1175 employees as soon as possible, leaving \nonly a skeleton crew to oversee the functions associated with the RIF.  Pls.’ Ex. JJ [Dkt. # 66-1] \nat Page 10 of 60.  \nTo do that, it was necessary to ask OPM to exempt the CFPB from the ninety-day notice \nperiod ordinarily required when an agency implements a RIF, which is supposed to give the \ndischarged employees an opportunity to compete for the positions that remain.  Since it had already \nbeen determined that there would be no open positions to fill, because the agency was shutting \ndown completely, the agency submitted a request for an exception to the ninety-day period on \nFebruary 13.  Pls.’ Ex. JJ [Dkt. # 66-1] at Pages 9–11 of 60.   \nWhat did the CFBP identify as the “circumstances” that would warrant giving notice less \nthan 90 days before a proposed reduction?  It wrote:  “[t]he CFPB is responding to Executive Order \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 44 of 112\nImplementing The President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization \nInitiative . . . dated February 11, 2025 and the CFPB Acting Director’s work stoppage order dated \nFebruary 10, 2025.”  Id. at 11. \nUnsurprisingly, the Office of Personnel Management approved the request the next day, \nagain citing only two reasons:  the Executive Order of February 11, and “the CFPB Acting \nDirector’s work stoppage order dated February 10, 2025.”  Pls.’ Ex. OO [Dkt. # 66-1] at Page 28 \nof 60.  \nGiven this set of exchanges between the two departments operating under Russell Vought’s \ndirect control, the defendants’ suggestion that the document that both agencies referred to as a \n“work stoppage order” was merely interlocutory, and not a “final order” from which legal \nconsequences flowed, is entirely unsustainable. \nAnd the consequences kept on coming.  On February 13, “term” employees, who were \nhired under a temporary/excepted appointment were terminated, and again, the Executive Order \nand “the stop work email from Russ Vought” were identified as the justifications.  See Pls.’ Ex. \nQQ [Dkt. # 66-1] at Page 32–33 of 60. \nOn February 14, the CFPB’s Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez was informed by \nOPM that employees typically work during the notice period, even if it has been truncated to thirty \ndays, so he asked Mark Paoletta, Director Vought’s legal advisor at both OPM and the CFPB, for \n“clarification and expectations.”  Pls.’ Ex. KK [Dkt. # 66-1] at Page 13 of 60.   After that \nconversation, Martinez communicated that all staff would be placed on administrative leave for \nthe thirty-day notice period.  See id.  The Operations Manager of the CFPB Office of Human \nCapital then disseminated instructions that “employees should exercise administrative leave until \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 45 of 112\notherwise  instructed”  –  why?  –  “[i]n  accordance  with  the  Acting  Director’s  guidance”  of \nFebruary 10.  Pls.’ Ex. J [Dkt. # 60-1] at Page 27 of 107. \nCount Three specifically includes the issuance of the stop work directive as one of \ndefendants’ orders that constitutes final action under the APA.  Given the facts set forth above, the \nCourt finds that the amended complaint presents at least one final, discrete agency action for the \nCourt’s review under the APA.    \nHowever, that is not the only focus of the complaint.  Defendants point to plaintiffs’ \niteration of the series of steps taken by agency leadership, including the February 10 work stoppage \norder, and plaintiffs’ description of those circumstances as an unlawful effort “to dismantle an \nagency that Congress established,” Am. Compl. ¶ 9, see also, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 4, 10, 80, 91, \n92, 94, as an indication that the complaint amounts to nothing more than a “programmatic” \nchallenge that does not pass muster under the APA given the Supreme Court’s pronouncements in \nLujan and SUWA.  Defs.’ Opp. at 15–16. \n  But this lawsuit is not a challenge of any agency “program.”  It does not challenge any \nexercise of the agency’s discretionary authority to regulate activities within its purview or to \nenforce particular statutory provisions.  It is a challenge to the wholesale cessation of activities –\nthe decision to shut down the agency completely – which is not within the executive’s authority. \nDefendants can hardly complain that the focus of the action is too broad; it was the Acting Director \nwho chose to paint with a broad brush, not plaintiffs.   \nDefendants quote SUWA for the proposition that “the purpose of the APA’s discrete agency \naction requirement is: ‘to protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful \ndiscretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 46 of 112\nboth expertise and information to resolve.”  Defs.’ Opp. at 16, quoting SUWA, 542 U.S. at 66–\n67.11   \nNone of those principles is at risk here. The decision to close an agency is not a theoretical \nor hypothetical concept – it’s real.  The agency is either open or it’s not.  It is either responding to \ncalls from consumers or it’s not.  There is nothing abstract about firing employees, cutting off the \nfunding stream, terminating contracts, or stopping all work; plaintiffs are not engaged in a “policy” \ndisagreement with the agency, but a battle for its existence.  Therefore, in the Court’s view, even \nif the February 10 work stoppage order does not satisfy the requirements of a “final order,” the \n \n11   By introducing and editing the quoted language from the SUWA opinion in this manner, \ndefendants leave out the circumstances that were being discussed in that case, which are easily \ndistinguished from the case at hand. In SUWA, the petitioners were challenging an agency’s \n“failure to act” under section 706(1) of the APA.  542 U.S. at 61–62.  And while the Supreme \nCourt made it clear that like the actions that can be set aside under section 706(2), an agency action \nthat can be compelled under section 706(1) must be a discrete one, 542 U.S. at 63, it also went to \nsome lengths to liken section 706(1) to a writ of mandamus and explain that “a claim under 706(1) \ncan proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete action that it is \nrequired to take.”  Id. at 64 (emphasis in original).  See also id. at 65 (“The limitation to required \nagency action rules out judicial direction of even discrete agency action that is not mandated by \nlaw. . . .”) (emphasis in original). \n“With these principles in mind,” the Court then turned to one of the claims before it and \nfound that the statute the petitioners were seeking to enforce in that claim left the agency with a \ngreat deal of discretion as to how to achieve the broad statutory objectives.  Id. at 65–66.  It was \nin that context that the Court made the quoted remarks about “[t]he principal purpose of the APA \nlimitations we have discussed – and of the traditional limitations upon mandamus from with they \nwere derived,” and went on to express concern about the situation that would arise “if courts were \nempowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates[,]” and \nfind that  “the prospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency \ncompliance with such congressional directives is not contemplated by the APA.”  Id. at 66–67 \n(emphasis added).  \n \nHere, plaintiffs are not invoking the APA to compel compliance with any statutory \nprovision under section 706(1); while it will be prudent to ensure than any interim relief ordered \nis enforceable without the Court’s taking on the problematic role of managing the agency’s \nday-to-day operations, the cited section of SUWA does not bear on this Court’s subject matter \njurisdiction or the merits of plaintiff’s APA claims. \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 47 of 112\nAPA claims in Counts Three and Four can be construed as challenging a final, concrete decision \nto shut down the agency entirely.12   \nThe fact that the effort was temporarily stymied or slowed down by the Court’s intervention \nand entry of a consent order to freeze the situation does not mean that the decision is not yet \nfinalized or that it was ever abandoned.  As will be explained in more detail below, notwithstanding \ndefendants’ considerable efforts to paper over what they were assiduously trying to accomplish in \none stroke before the Court ruled at the TRO hearing on February 14, their subsequent attempts to \ndeny what was afoot are at odds with the undisputed facts in the record and the documents \nproduced by both sides.  Indeed, only two days after the agency’s Legal Officer – who like the \npolice chief in Casablanca who was “shocked, shocked” to find gambling going on – professed to \nbe surprised that some employees were not working, the White House posted a message on its \n“Work for You Again” webpage boasting:  “President Trump ordered the Consumer Financial \nProtection  Bureau  –  the  brainchild  of  Elizabeth  Warren,  which  funneled  cash  to  left-wing \nadvocacy groups – to halt operations.”  Pls.’ Ex HH [Dkt. # 60-1] (underlining in original).  In \n \n12   Count One could also be construed as being brought under section 706(2)(B) of the APA, \nwhich authorizes the reviewing court to set aside agency action “contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).   \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 48 of 112\nsum, the impending closure of the agency is also an action that can be a subject of review under \nthe APA.13   \nB.  There are plaintiffs with standing to bring this action. \n“[T]o give meaning to  Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement, the courts have \ndeveloped  a  series  of  principles  termed  ‘justiciability  doctrines,’”  which  include  standing, \nripeness, mootness, and the political question doctrine.  Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. United \nStates, 101 F.3d 1423,  1427 (D.C. Cir. 1996), citing Allen, 468 U.S.  at 750;  Fla. Audubon \nSoc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (standing is a necessary “predicate \nto any exercise of our jurisdiction”).  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that \nit has “suffered an injury in fact” that “is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,” \nand it must be “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.”  Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000), \n \n13   Defendants have directed the Court to the memorandum opinion and order issued in Mayor \nand City Council of Baltimore v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Civ. No. MJM-25-458, \n2025 WL 814500 (D. Md. Mar. 14, 2025).  See Defs.’ Notice of Suppl. Auth. [Dkt. # 78] (pointing \nout that “the court emphasized and explained that ‘[t]he distinction between discrete acts, which \nare reviewable, and programmatic challenges, which are not, is vital to’ the APA’s ‘conception of \nthe separation of powers;’” and that “the Baltimore court rejected plaintiffs’ assertion that they \ncould ‘challenge a disembodied and unrealized [purported] decision to drain the CFPB of its \noperating funds and reserves’”).   \nThe district court’s thoughtful analysis in that case does not bear on the resolution of this \none. The Baltimore lawsuit dealt solely with the funding of the agency, and in particular, Vought’s \nFebruary 8 letter to Jerome Powell and the fact that the CFO was communicating with the Federal \nReserve later that week about the possibility of transferring funds back to the Federal Reserve.  \n2025 WL 814500 at *12–14.  Whether those circumstances were sufficiently final to be amenable \nto judicial review does not aid in answering the questions addressed here:  was the February 10 \nstop work order final, and has there been a reviewable decision to close the agency entirely? \nMoreover, the court in Baltimore based its factual conclusions on what was taking place on the \ndeclarations and documents before it; it did not have the benefit of the full evidentiary hearing held \nin this case, which cast some of those declarations and documents in a distinctly different light. \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 49 of 112\nquoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Banner Health v. \nPrice, 867 F.3d 1323, 1333–34 (D.C. Cir. 2017).   \nA plaintiff must show a personal interest in the dispute at all stages of litigation, Davis v. \nFed. Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724, 733 (2008), demonstrating standing “with the manner and \ndegree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nWhen  seeking  a  preliminary  injunction,  a  plaintiff  must  show  standing  with  specific  facts \nsupported by affidavit or other evidence.  See Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. United States Dep’t of Com., \n928 F.3d 95, 104 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (holding that in the context of a preliminary injunction, courts \nconsider “whether the plaintiff has a substantial likelihood of standing – that is, whether the \nplaintiff is likely to be able to demonstrate standing at the summary judgment stage”), quoting \nFood & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015).   \nWhile “plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press,” TransUnion \nLLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021), it is not necessary that each plaintiff in a case show \nstanding for each claim; a showing that one plaintiff has standing is sufficient.  UAW-Lab. Emp. \n& Training Corp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 362 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“[UAW] clearly has standing, and \nwe need not consider whether the other plaintiffs do.”), citing Mountain States Legal Found. v. \nGlickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  And plaintiffs need not await the harm to occur \nbefore they can sue or obtain relief:  “a person exposed to a risk of future harm may pursue forward \nlooking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm.”  TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 436, citing Clapper \nv. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 414, n.5 (2013); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 \n(1983). \nThe six plaintiffs in this case include three member organizations – a union and an \nassociation that both represent CFPB employees, and a membership-based advocacy group; two \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 50 of 112\nconsumer advocacy groups; and the estate of an individual consumer who passed away during the \npendency of this case.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13–18.  The Court finds that some of them have \npresented specific facts supported by affidavit or other evidence to demonstrate that they have \nstanding, and therefore, it need not address them all at this stage. \n1.  Injury in fact  \nAn injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is both (a) concrete and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, as opposed to merely conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 560.  An injury is particularized if it affects the plaintiff in a personal and individual \nmanner.  Id. at 560 n.1. \n(a)  Member Organizations  \nThe National Treasury Employees Union is a union that represents CFPB employees, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 13; see Kaspar Decl. ¶ 2, and the CFPB Employee Association is an association of current \nand former CFPB employees, including probationary employees who have already been fired.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 18; Decl. of Christina Coll [Dkt. # 38-15] (“Coll Decl.”) ¶¶ 2–3.  Defendants \ncontend that plaintiff CFPB Employee Association has not established standing.  Defs.’ Opp. at \n9–10.   \nA union or other member organization can assert organizational standing on its own behalf, \nassociational standing on behalf of its members, or both.  Equal Rts. Ctr. v. Post Properties, Inc., \n633 F.3d 1136, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 2011), citing Abigail All. For Better Access to Developmental \nDrugs v. Eschenbach, 469 F.3d 129, 132 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  An organization has standing on its \nown behalf if it satisfies the same standing test that applies to individuals:  an actual or threatened \ninjury in fact that is fairly traceable to the alleged illegal action and likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable court decision.  Spann v. Colonial Vill., Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  An \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 51 of 112\norganization has associational standing if it can show that “(a) its members would otherwise have \nstanding  to  sue  in  their  own  right;  (b) the  interests  it  seeks  to  protect  are  germane  to  the \norganization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the \nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. Transp. Sec. \nAdmin., 429 F.3d 1130, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2005), quoting United Food & Comm. Workers Union \nLoc. 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 553 (1996) (internal quotation omitted).  \nActions by a defendant that “make it more difficult for” an organization “to accomplish \n[its] primary mission . . . provide injury for purposes both of standing and irreparable harm.”  \nLeague of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016); see also People for the \nEthical Treatment of Animals v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 797 F.3d 1087, 1093 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“The \nUnited States Supreme Court has made plain that a ‘concrete and demonstrable injury to [an] \norganization’s activities – with the consequent drain on the organization’s resources – constitutes \nfar more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests’ and thus suffices for \nstanding.”), quoting Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (holding that generalized \ngrievances or an abstract concern with a subject that could be affected by the case does not confer \nstanding, but a showing that alleged illegal action will increase the resources the group must devote \nto programs independent of the lawsuit challenging the action does).  \nThe  CFPB  Employee  Association  has  shown  both  organizational  and  associational \nstanding.  The association’s membership is made up entirely of CFPB employees, “dedicated \npublic servants,” including probationary and term employees, and its purpose to advance CFPB \nemployees and the mission of the agency.  Coll Decl. [Dkt. # 38-15] ¶¶ 2–3.  Given that the \nassociation’s existence depends on the existence of an agency workforce, the actions by defendants \nto eliminate the CFPB would undoubtedly “make it more difficult for” the association “to \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 52 of 112\naccomplish [its] primary mission.”  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 9.  This is enough to \ndemonstrate an injury in fact to support organizational standing.  See id.  \nMoreover, the CFPB Employee Association has demonstrated associational standing.  \nDefendants terminated probationary and term CFPB employees en masse and without cause during \nthe week of February 10 and is poised to fire the remaining employees.  Alex Doe Testimony, \nMar. 11 Tr. at 45; Alex Doe Decl. [Dkt. # 38-2] at 4.14  Association members who have serious \nhealth issues or have family members with serious health issues face the risk of concrete and actual \nor immanent harm if they lose the health care coverage that comes with their jobs.

But it does not find that the decision in a different case and a \ndifferent district, challenging a much broader set of executive actions, on grounds different than \nthose advanced here, being brought by the states as opposed to the organizations and individuals \nfound to have standing here, should control the interim management of this case, particularly given \nthe fact that the government has already appealed it, and the finality of it is uncertain.   \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 53 of 112\nDefendants argue that in seeking a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff-association must \nidentify a particular member who has standing.

While the actions against employees that \nhave been taken or threatened are among the facts alleged in the complaint, the Court need not \ndecide now whether it can or should address their legality when the case proceeds on the merits; \nat this point, its focus is the closure of the agency as a whole.   \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 54 of 112\nthe association’s state-by-state conferences “to protect members in the respective state from \nfinancial harm,” Bross Decl. ¶ 6, as well as an educational program offered with the CFPB for its \nmembers on “housing discrimination, CFPB financial protection, and how to protect financial \nrights.”  Bross Decl. ¶ 7.

West-Tillman has been the target \nof numerous financial scams and predatory schemes targeting fire victims, and she has “had a \ndifficult time determining what assistance was legitimate and what was fraudulent.”  West-Tillman \nDecl. ¶ 3.  She planned to take advantage of and rely on CFPB’s assistance, but defendants’ stop \nwork order and other actions leave her and other NAACP members at risk of becoming victims of \nfinancial predators.  Id. ¶¶ 3–4.  This is not mere speculation; it is a concrete, actual harm to \nNAACP member West-Tillman. \n(b)  Consumer Advocacy Organizations \nPlaintiffs National Consumer Law Center and Virginia Poverty Law Center have also \npresented sufficient evidence to show they have suffered an injury in fact.  The National Consumer \nLaw Center is both a customer of and a vendor to the Bureau.  It researches, publishes, and \nconducts presentations and seminars on matters that affect low-income consumers, and it relies \nheavily on the CFPB’s reports and consumer database for that work.  See Decl. of Richard Dubois, \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 55 of 112\nEx. 6 to Pls.’ TRO Mem. [Dkt. # 14-6] (“Dubois Decl.”) ¶¶ 3–4, 10–13.16  Losing this data will \nundermine a key part of its mission and work, id., and this type of informational injury has long \nbeen accepted as sufficient to confer standing.  See Action All. of Senior Citizens of Greater Phila. \nv. Heckler, 789 F.2d 931, 937–38 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (organization suffered cognizable injury when \ngovernment cut off “generous flow of information” on which it relied); Drs. for Am. v. Off. of Pers. \nMgmt., 2025 WL 452707, at *9 (D.D.C.

The Bureau terminated its subscription to NCLC’s manual and \ncancelled the three-part training series NCLC had been retained to provide to CFPB staff.  See \nDubois Decl. ¶¶ 7–8 (“The CFPB’s contract is the largest single publications contract for NCLC \nand significant[ly] assists in funding NCLC’s publications work.”); Feb. 11, 2025 Email from \nCFPB Supervisory Contracting Officer Braden Sanner to NCLC, Pls.’ Ex.

NCLC’s work \nwill increase as a result of defendants’ actions:  in the absence of the CFPB, it will have to organize \nmore trainings and publish more materials; it will have to use more resources to support the legal \nservice providers that will have to handle the diverted consumer complaints; and it will have to \n \n16   See 12 U.S.C. § 5493(b)(3)(A) (requiring the bureau to maintain a database of consumer \ncomplaints and responses); 12 U.S.C. § 5499 (requiring all public data assets published by \nthe bureau to be made publicly available); see also 12 U.S.C. § 5493(b)(1), (3)(c), (d)(4); id. \n§ 5496(c); 15 U.S.C. § 1646(a), (b); id. § 1632(d)(3); id. § 2809(a); and id. § 5512(c)(3) (requiring \nreports from various units and the Director). \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 56 of 112\ndramatically increase its advocacy in the states and redirect advocacy to multiple agencies and \nlitigation that would otherwise not be necessary.

[Dkt. # 14-5] (“Speer Decl.”) ¶ 2.  It relies on CFPB’s \nConsumer Response unit to assist it in providing aid to consumers who call VPLC’s predatory \nlending helpline, and “[i]f the complaint system goes away entirely or becomes so unreliable that \nit cannot be depended upon, it will make fulfilling our consumer-protection mission much harder.”  \nId. ¶¶ 9–10, 15–16, 24.  This also constitutes injury in fact. \n(c)  Individual Consumer  \nFinally, at the time this action was filed, individual plaintiff Reverend Eva Steege was \nengaged in receiving assistance from the CFPB when defendants stopped the Bureau’s work.  At \nthe time, Steege was 83-years old and a Pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.  See Decl. of \nPastor Eva Steege, Ex. 2 to Pls.’ TRO Mem. [Dkt. # 14-2] (“Steege Decl.”) ¶ 1.  She incurred \nstudent loans when pursuing higher education at the Lutheran Theological Seminary.

It was her hope to resolve the debt \nand spare her family that burden after she died.    Id. ¶ 2.  She had been trying to enroll in the \nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness Program to no avail, and contacted the CFPB for help.  Id. ¶¶ 2–\n3.   \nOn  January  23,  2025,  Steege  met  with  CFPB  employees  and  the  Student  Loan \nOmbudsman, who explained that she qualified for not only loan forgiveness under the program, \nbut also a $15,000 refund of overpayments.

Steege’s fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her \nstudent loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died.  See Suggestion of Death [Dkt. # 83].  \nNow that her husband, Ted Steege, has been substituted as a plaintiff in her stead, Min. Order \n(March 26, 2025) (granting motion to substitute), he has standing on his own behalf and on behalf \nof her estate to pursue her claim.17 \n2.  Causation and Redressability \n“It is well established that ‘[c]ausation, or traceability, examines whether it is substantially \nprobable that the challenged acts of the defendant, not of some absent third party, will cause the \nparticularized injury of the plaintiff.’”  Grocery Mfrs. Ass’n v. EPA, 693 F.3d 169, 176 (D.C. Cir. \n2012) (alteration in original), quoting Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. \n1996); see also Freedom Republicans, Inc. v. FEC, 13 F.3d 412, 418 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (“fair \ntraceability turns on the causal nexus between the agency action and the asserted injury”).  Further, \nplaintiffs must demonstrate that it is “‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that their injuries \n \n17   Defendants argue that the PSLF program is administered by the Department of Education, \nsee Defs.’ Opp. at 22–23, 38, but this is of no moment.  The CFPB works hand-in-hand with the \nDepartment to assist consumers trying to enroll in the PSLF; “[m]any of the issues that borrowers \nlike Pastor Steege face related to federal student loans are, in fact, related to the acts and practices \nof private student loan servicing companies.”  Barnard Decl. ¶¶ 11–12; see 12 U.S.C. § 5535(c)(2) \n(providing that the student loan ombudsman works to “ensure coordination in providing assistance \nto and serving borrowers seeking to resolve complaints related to their private education or Federal \nstudent loans”) (emphasis added).  And contrary to defendants’ assertion, see Defs.’ Opp. at 38, \nSteege showed that her efforts to apply own were unsuccessful, and her time was indeed running \nout.  Steege Decl. ¶¶ 1–3.  This is enough to establish injury in fact.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 58 of 112\nwill be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. \nWelfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38 (1976). \nDefendants  do  not  dispute  that  plaintiffs’  claimed  injuries  in  fact  are  traceable  to \ndefendants’ actions or that efforts to shut down the CFPB.  The challenged actions – including the \nstop work order from Vought, and the decision to shutter the Bureau, implemented by cancelling \nCFPB  contracts,  terminating  term  and  probationary  employees,  and  preparing  to  execute \nwidespread RIFs – directly threaten the very existence of the CFPB Employee Association and \nhave placed its terminated employee members and their families at risk.  They have caused the \nNAACP to cancel planned trainings and programs and halted direct support Bureau staff were \ngiving to NAACP members trying to differentiate between legitimate financial support and \nunscrupulous criminals preying on who were victims of the Altadena fires.  They will cause both \nNCLC and VPLC to expend more resources on their missions, and they have left Pastor Steege’s \nheirs at risk of inheriting unresolved student debt.  Nor do defendants dispute that a ruling from \nthis Court in plaintiffs’ favor would redress these injuries.   \nAccordingly, Court finds that several plaintiffs have demonstrated that they meet the \nrequirements for Article III standing and that is has jurisdiction over this case.  See TransUnion \nLLC, 594 U.S. at 431; UAW-Lab. Emp. & Training Corp., 325 F.3d at 362.   \nVI.  A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE STATUS \nQUO. \n“A preliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.’”  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011), quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “The \npurpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until \na trial on the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  Rule 65 \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 59 of 112\nauthorizes a district court to issue interim relief to prevent irreparable injury and to preserve the \nstatus quo while the district court assesses the merits of a case.  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, \n2025 WL 559669, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025), citing Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 301, 314 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (“The usual role of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending \nthe outcome of litigation.”) (cleaned up).  A district court “ha[s] authority, from the necessity of \nthe case, to make orders to preserve the existing conditions and the subject of the petition” until it \ncan determine how to proceed, as “the law contemplates the possibility of a decision either way, \nand therefore must provide for it.”  Id. at *3, quoting United States v. Shipp, 203 U.S. 563, 573 \n(1906).   \n“The standard for obtaining either a TRO or a preliminary injunction is identical.”  Id., \nciting Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 723–24 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  When considering a motion for \na preliminary injunction, the Court must consider whether the movant has met its burden of \ndemonstrating that:  (1) it “is likely to succeed on the merits,” (2) it is “likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief,” (3) “the balance of equities tips in [its] favor,” and \n(4) an injunction serves the public interest.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.   \n  For some time, the Court of Appeals adhered to a “sliding-scale” approach, where “a strong \nshowing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.”  Sherley, 644 F.3d at 392.  \nHowever, in Sherley, the Court explained that because the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter \n“seemed  to  treat  the  four  factors  as  independent  requirements,”  it  had  more  recently \n“read Winter at least to suggest if not to hold ‘that a likelihood of success is an independent, free-\n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 60 of 112\nstanding requirement for a preliminary injunction.’”  Id. at 393, quoting Davis v. Pension Benefit \nGuar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).18   \nWhatever the status of the sliding scale analysis might be, the D.C. Circuit has clearly \nstated that a failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits is sufficient to defeat a motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Ark. Dairy Coop. Ass’n, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 573 F.3d \n815, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253–54 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  As \nanother court in this district has observed, “absent a substantial indication of likely success on the \nmerits, there would be no justification for the Court’s intrusion into the ordinary processes of \nadministration and judicial review.”  Navistar, Inc. v. EPA, Civil Action No. 11-cv-449 (RLW), \n2011 WL 3743732, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 25, 2011) (alteration omitted), quoting Hubbard v. United \nStates, 496 F. Supp. 2d 194, 198 (D.D.C. 2007).   \nMoreover, it remains the law in this Circuit that a movant must demonstrate irreparable \nharm, which has “always” been a “basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts.”  Sampson v. \nMurray, 415 U.S. 61, 88 (1974), quoting Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506–\n07 (1959).   \nThe Court finds that a consideration of each of the factors supports the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction in this case.  The testimony before the Court and the declarations and \nexhibits submitted by both sides have established that the requested relief is absolutely necessary \n \n18   The Court of Appeals has not gone further to clarify whether the sliding scale approach is \ninconsistent with Winter, and the manner in which courts should weigh the four factors “remains \nan open question” in this Circuit.  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  See \nalso League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“Because appellants \nsatisfy each of the four preliminary injunction factors, this case presents no occasion for the court \nto decide whether the ‘sliding scale’ approach remains valid after Winter.”); Changji Esquel \nTextile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (reiterating that the Court has not yet \ndecided the issue).  \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 61 of 112\nto preserve the status quo so that the CFPB will still be standing when the Court reaches the merits \nof this case.   \nA.  Likelihood of Success of the Merits \n1.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their ultra vires and constitutional \nclaims in Count One. \nAs defendants’ many citations to Article II of the United States Constitution imply, there \nis an Article I.  And Article I, Section 1 provides: “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States . . . .”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.    \nArticle I, Section 8 lists the powers of Congress, including “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . \namong the several States,” and “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \ncarrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in \nthe Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.”  U.S. Const. art. I, \n§ 8.  This power includes the authority to create new federal agencies and official positions.  See \nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138 (1976) (under the Necessary and Proper Clause, “Congress may \nundoubtedly . . . create ‘offices’”).   As Chief Justice Marshall explained more than 200 years ago, \nthe framers included this provision “in a constitution, intended to endure for ages to come . . . to \nbe adapted to the many crises of human affairs.”  M’Culloch v. State, 17 U.S. 316, 415 (1819) \n(emphasis in original).  \nUnder the Constitution, the President does not have legislative authority.  Instead, Article II \nvests executive power in “a President of the United States of America,” who “shall take Care that \nthe Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II § 3 (the Take Care Clause).  The Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly emphasized the breadth of the President’s discretion to determine how this \nshould be done, but it has also drawn a clear demarcation between executing, or implementing, the \nlaws and making them in the first place.   \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 62 of 112\nIn the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see \nthat the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be \na lawmaker.  The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking \nprocess to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing \nof laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither silent nor \nequivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to \nexecute.  \n \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952).  After all, members of \nCongress are democratically elected too. \nCongress exercised its legislative power in 2010 in response to a genuine, devastating \nfinancial crisis.  It created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and gave it a job to do: \nThere is established in the Federal Reserve System, an independent bureau \nto be known as the “Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection”, which shall \nregulate  the  offering  and  provision  of consumer financial  products  or \nservices under the Federal consumer financial laws.   \n12 U.S.C. § 5491(a).  The Dodd-Frank Act was quite specific about what that regulation would \nentail, including:  “establishing a single, toll-free telephone number, a website, and a database . . . \nto facilitate the centralized collection of, monitoring of, and response to consumer complaints \nregarding consumer financial products or services,” 12 U.S.C. § 5493(b)(3)(A); designating a \nPrivate Education Loan Ombudsman within the Bureau “to provide timely assistance to borrowers \nof private education loans,” id. § 5535(a); establishing an Office of Financial Protection for Older \nAmericans, id. § 5535(g)(3)(B), an Office of Service Member Affairs, id. § 5535(d)(2), and the \nOffice of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, id. § 5493(c); and researching, analyzing, and \nreporting on market developments for consumer financial products and services and consumer \naccess to those products and services.  See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1646(a), (b); id. § 1632(d)(3).  In \naccordance with the Constitution, these provisions mandating the existence of, and the functions \nto be carried out by, the CFPB were enacted by the legislative branch and signed into law by the \nPresident of the United States.   \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 63 of 112\nPlaintiffs  allege  in  Count  One  that  defendants  were  intent  on  executing  the  current \nPresident’s plan to eliminate the agency and to do so in a hurry, in violation of the statutory \nimperatives of the Dodd-Frank Act and contrary to the constitutional limitations on executive \nauthority and the Take Care Clause.19  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 75–80. \nIt is fundamental to the separation of powers embodied in the Constitution that “[t]he \nPresident’s power . . . must stem from either an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.” \nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 585.  Defendants do not even try to maintain that the Constitution or any \nstatute accorded the President the authority to dismantle the agency.  Instead, in their February 24 \nopposition to the motion for preliminary injunction, they denied that it was happening at all, or \nthat there was any imminent risk of its happening in the near future if the Court declined to act.  \n[O]n February 8, 2025, Russell Vought, Acting Director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), e-mailed all CFPB staff to direct \nthat,  unless  “required  by  law”  or  “expressly  approved  by  the  Acting \nDirector,” staff were not to take substantive actions that might reflect policy \ndecisions inconsistent with new leadership’s views on the best way to meet \nthe  agency’s  statutory  responsibilities.  As  Acting  Director  Vought \nexplained, he was “committed to implementing the President’s policies, \nconsistent with the law, and acting as a faithful steward of the Bureau’s \nresources.”  \n*  *  * \n \n19   Plaintiffs characterize Count One as a claim seeking “non-statutory review of official and \nagency action,” an effort to “enjoin[] and declare unlawful official action that is ultra vires.”  Am. \nCompl. ¶ 75.  As a “weapon in the arsenal for attacking federal administrative action,” an ultra \nvires claim requires the Court to determine whether defendants “plainly act[ed] in excess of [their] \ndelegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is clear and mandatory.”  \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022), quoting Nyunt \nv. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  The count complains \nthat defendants overstepped both the constitutional and statutory limitations on their authority:  \nparagraph 76 invokes the Take Care Clause in Article II of the Constitution; paragraph 79 of the \namended complaint alleges that “[t]he CFPB was established as a federal agency by Congress by \nstatute, the Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in 2010, and can be eliminated only by Congress”; \nand paragraph 80 asserts that “[d]efendants’ actions to eliminate the CFPB exceed executive \nauthority, usurp legislative authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution, defendant \nVought was not lawfully appointed, and his actions are ultra vires and should be enjoined.” \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 64 of 112\nGiven . . . disruptive protests involving the CFPB’s own staff, CFPB \nleadership has closed the CFPB Headquarters Building and tightened staff \nsupervision, making sure that they are focused only on aspects of the \nmission that are, in fact, urgently required by law, as determined by the \nChief Legal Officer.  Under this internal procedure, work requests have \nbeen approved to allow the CFPB to maintain its statutory obligations.  \n \nRemarkably, the CFPB employee groups and other Plaintiffs now spin these \nactions and others as being part of a “coordinated campaign by the new \nadministration to eliminate the” CFPB.  But President Trump has nominated \nJonathan McKernan . . . to be the new CFPB Director, and the Senate \nBanking Committee will hold a hearing on his nomination this week –\nactions  that  are  inconsistent  with  Plaintiffs’  view  of  current  events. \nSimilarly,  as  Acting  Director  Vought  noted  in  a  letter  to  the  Federal \nReserve,  the  “Bureau’s  new  leadership  will  run  a  substantially  more \nstreamlined and efficient bureau[.]”  The predicate to running a “more \nstreamlined and efficient bureau” is that there will continue to be a CFPB.  \n \n Defs.’ Opp. at 1–2 (internal citations and footnote omitted) (alteration in original).  This rosy \ndepiction of events, designed to assuage the Court, was accompanied by the February 24, 2025 \nDeclaration of Adam Martinez, the Chief Operating Officer of the CFPB, First Martinez Decl., \nwhich was a carefully worded and highly selective account that was immediately contradicted by \na second series of declarations and exhibits submitted by the plaintiffs.  The defendants’ witness \nwas  then  placed  in  the  awkward  position  of  submitting  another  declaration,  in  which  he \nacknowledged the accuracy of the facts set forth by plaintiffs’ declarants, including their accounts \nof his own statements, but he still voiced the assurance that the agency was complying with its \nstatutory obligations.  See Second Martinez Decl. \n  The plaintiffs and the defendants have both provided the Court with numerous exhibits – \ncommunications within the CFPB and with OPM and other third parties, such as contractors – and \nthere is no dispute as to their authenticity for purposes of this motion.  In short, there is no dispute \nas to the facts of what took place and what was said; the parties differ as to what it all means. \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 65 of 112\nIt is now clear to the Court that the omissions from the first declaration rendered it to be \nhighly misleading, if not intentionally false.  Defendants’ initial effort to persuade the Court in \ntheir opposition that employees were hard at work on their statutory duties even after they were \nordered to stand down on February 10 has been shown to be unreliable and inconsistent with the \nagency’s own contemporaneous records, and the defendants’ eleventh hour attempt to suggest \nimmediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all was \nso disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell \nthe truth about anything. \nAfter consideration of the record as a whole, then, including all of the declarations and \nexhibits submitted by both sides, and the testimony introduced by both sides at the hearing, the \nCourt finds that it is likely that plaintiffs will succeed on the merits.  The evidence reveals that:  \nthe defendants were in fact engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down \nentirely when the motion for injunctive relief was filed; while the effort to do so was stalled by the \nCourt’s intervention, the plan remains unchanged; and the defendants have absolutely no intention \nof operating the CFPB at all.  While the President is free to propose legislation to Congress to \naccomplish this aim, the defendants are not free to eliminate an agency created by statute on their \nown, and certainly not before the Court has had an opportunity to rule on the merits of the \nplaintiffs’ challenge.   \n(a) The agency was in shut down mode as of February 10. \nIn his first declaration, Adam Martinez characterized the February 3 email from the then \nActing Director of the CFPB, Secretary of the Treasury Bessent, and the February 8 email from \nthe current Acting Director, Russell Vought, as being consistent with typical practice during a \nPresidential transition. See First Martinez Decl. ¶¶ 2, 3, 11 (“It is not unusual for these types of \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 66 of 112\nsteps to be taken at an agency at the beginning of a new administration and during the transition \nperiod for new leadership.”).  He described the February 10 email as a communication providing \nboth validation that the building was closed and “instructions regarding work tasks.”  Id. ¶ 14.  He \naverred that “[s]ince the arrival of the Acting Director, the new leadership is engaging in ongoing \ndecision-making to assess how to make the Bureau more efficient and accountable.  Our leadership \nhas worked to comply with statutorily required functions . . . . ”  Id. ¶19.  The declaration noted \nthat on Saturday, February 8, Vought’s first day on the job, the new Acting Director wrote a letter \nto the Chair of the Federal Reserve Bank to say that the agency would not need any funds for the \nthird quarter of 2025.  Id. ¶ 27, citing Ex. G to First Martinez Decl.  It recounted that the agency \nheadquarters building was closed on February 9, see Feb. 9 Email, and Martinez asserted that \n“[t]he closure of the CFPB’s Headquarters pursuant to the February 9 and 10 emails has not \nprevented the CFPB from performing statutory functions.”  First Martinez Decl. ¶ 20.    \nBut the declaration makes no reference to the fact that Vought’s February 10 email to all \nemployees contained the directive, “[p]lease do not perform any work tasks.”  See Feb. 10 Email \n(emphasis added). \nIn fact, as Martinez acknowledged during his testimony, by February 10, the agency was \nbarreling full speed ahead in an effort to dismantle the agency completely by the end of the week.  \nAt the hearing, primarily on cross-examination, Martinez described a succession of circumstances \nthat bore no resemblance to the impression his declaration had been drafted to convey.  The work \nstoppage order was issued on Monday the 10th, and according to Martinez, effective that day, \n“most employees were taking administrative leave;” in fact, they were “told to take it.”  Martinez \nTestimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 52.

See Martinez \nTestimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 128.  At the meeting, Martinez explained to his team that the CFPB was \ngoing to fire “the vast majority of its employees,” and that new leadership was asking that it be \naccomplished “as quickly as possible.”  Id. at 126–28.  Agency employees who were still within \ntheir one-year probationary period were fired that Monday, and those still within their two-year \nprobationary periods were fired by Tuesday the 11th.  Id. at 45, 128.  This affected approximately \n75 to 85 people.  Mar. 10 Tr. at 51; see also Diotalevi Decl. [Dkt. # 41-1] ¶ 4.   \nAlso on February 11, Mark Paoletta, who had been identified in the February 10 email as \nthe Chief Legal Officer of the CFPB, sent an email to Gueye Jafnar, the agency’s Chief Financial \nOfficer, Martinez, the Chief Operating Officer, and Jordan Wick, one of the DOGE employees \nwho by then had been deputized as an employee of the CFPB, saying: \nOn  behalf  of  Acting  Director  Vought,  I  have  reviewed  CFPB \ncontracts and authorize and direct the cancellation of all contracts in \nthe following divisions:  Enforcement (102 contracts), Supervision \n(16  contracts),  Consumer  Response  (20  contracts),  Office  of \nDirector (33 contracts), and Legal Division (all except 2 contracts \n. . .).    Further,  on  behalf  of  the  Acting  Director,  I  direct  the \ncancellation of the contract for concrete repairs. \n \n \n20   The new leadership found out almost immediately that the agency’s Office of Research \nwas responsible for calculating the Average Prime Offer Rate (“APOR”), an essential piece of data \nfor banks and mortgage lenders, and as of 7:15 p.m. on the evening of the 10th, Chief Legal Officer \nMark Paoletta directed that the work to publish it would continue.  See Defs.’ Ex. 3 [Dkt. # 56-1] \nat Page 4–5 of 116, CFPB_00004–5.   But this did not interrupt the effort to close the agency down \nin any way. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 68 of 112\nDefs.’ Ex. 4 [Dkt. # 56-1] at Page 6 of 116, CFPB_0006.  See also Pls.’ Ex. A [Dkt. # 60-1] \n(Feb. 11 “Urgent Action” email to contracting officers: “We need to get these Termination Notices \nout ASAP.”).  The record reflects that notices of cancellation started going out that day.  See, e.g., \nPls.’ Ex. D [Dkt. # 60-1] (Feb. 11 email to NCLC referencing the “blanket Stop Work Order” and \nnotifying the organization to stop work on the contract immediately).  See also Charlie Doe Decl. \n¶¶ 3–4 (“instructions to contracting officers did not reflect a change in policy direction, but rather \na wholesale termination of the contracts needed to keep the CFPB running,” and contracting \nofficers were told to work overtime to do so despite the work stoppage).  \n  While the CFO gave various offices the opportunity to identify those contracts that directly \nsupported a statutory requirement, “meaning that we would not be able to meet a statutory \nrequirement without [it],” Pls.’ Ex. F [Dkt. # 60-1], some of those contracts were terminated \nanyway.  See Decl. of Matthew Pfaff (“First Pfaff Decl.”) [Dkt. # 38-7] ¶ 27 (“I reviewed the list \nof contracts managed by Consumer Response and determined that five contracts directly supported \na statutory requirement. All five contracts were nevertheless terminated for convenience . . . .”).21 \nAnd the termination letters did not include instructions to vendors to preserve their data or records.  \nMar. 10 Tr. at 174. \n  By Thursday the 13th, 130 employees with “not to exceed” fixed terms had been told to \npack their bags.  See Diotalevi Decl. ¶ 14; Mar. 10 Tr. at 52.22  This included the employee who \nserved in the statutorily mandated position of Student Loan Ombudsman.  Pls.’ Ex. H.  Also by \n \n21   Martinez testified on direct that there were some instances in which staff members were \nable to contact Paoletta and request permission to reactivate; he characterized those as “a couple \nof high-priority issues that would have been devastating had it stopped.”  Mar. 10 Tr. at 77.  \n22   The workforce was also reduced as some employees accepted the “fork-in-the-road” early \nretirement option.

Diotalevi Decl. ¶ 6; Pls.’ Ex GG [Dkt. # 60-1].23 \nOn that Thursday, there was a lot of work to do to effectuate the RIF.  Alex Doe’s Human \nCapital team had been directed to help with the effort.  The record contains her declaration, and \nshe testified at the evidentiary hearing as well.  See Alex Doe Decl. [Dkt. # 38-2]; Mar. 11 Tr. at \n33–67.  She recounted that at a meeting on Thursday the 13th, Martinez explained that the agency \nwas in “wind-down mode,” and its statutory functions were going to be transferred to other \nagencies.  Decl. of Blake Doe [Dkt. # 38-3] ¶ 3; Second Martinez Decl. ¶ 3 (confirming Blake Doe \ndeclaration as accurate); Mar. 11 Tr. at 39.  The plan was to terminate the agency’s approximately \n1200 employees by eliminating whole offices, divisions and units, and RIF notices were being \nprepared that day.  Mar. 11 Tr. at 40; Alex Doe Decl. ¶ 3.  Jeremy Lewin, another DOGE \nrepresentative who had become a CFPB employee, told the group that they wanted the formal \nnotices to go out by the 14th.  Mar. 11 Tr. at 41–42.  According to Alex Doe, and as confirmed by \nMartinez, the Bureau was to “reduce altogether” in a second step sixty to ninety days after that.  \nSee Mar. 10 Tr. at 129–30 (Martinez describes that account as “absolutely correct” based on the \nfacts he had at the time).  See also Pls.’ Ex. JJ [Dkt. # 66-1] (“CFPB Memo to Michael Mahoney, \nOPM”) at Page 9–11 of 60 (identifying 1175 positions to be included in the first RIF).  At \napproximately 10:00 p.m. that evening, Jordan Wick reminded Martinez that Acting Director \n \n23   That same day, the CFO was already in communication with the Federal Reserve regarding \nthe Bureau’s ability to return money to either Treasury or the Federal Reserve if necessary.  See \nPls.’ Ex. E [Dkt. # 60-1]. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 70 of 112\nVought was expecting an update by 10:00 a.m. the next day.  Pls.’ Ex. JJ [Dkt. # 66-1] at Page 6 \nof 60.   \n  To achieve the desired level of speed, it was necessary to ask OPM for an exception from \nthe usual ninety-day notice period, and to give the employees only thirty days, and that request \nwas submitted on Thursday.  See CFPB Memo to Michael Mahoney, OPM, Pls.’ Ex. JJ.  In that \ndocument, the CFPB identified Vought’s stop work order as the extraordinary circumstance that \nwould justify such haste.  Id. at Page 11 of 60.  Martinez was informed via email that evening that \nthe request for the exception had been granted, and the formal approval was transmitted on \nFebruary 14.  See Pls.’ Ex. JJ. \nOn Friday morning, then, the team was awaiting the completion of the OPM documents \nthat would be attached to the RIF notices.  The CFPB RIF team gathered at 8:30 a.m. to review \ntemplates provided by OPM, and along with Martinez, they met with OPM at 10:00 a.m.  Alex \nDoe Testimony, Mar 11 Tr. at 47. \nJust after 12:00 a.m. that morning, though, the plaintiffs had filed an amended complaint \ncoupled with a motion for a temporary restraining order.  Am. Compl.  By approximately 11:00 \na.m., the Court had set a scheduling hearing for 2:00 p.m. that afternoon.  Martinez was notified \nby email of this development at approximately 1:36 p.m.; the sender noted, “[w]hile we will \ncontinue preparing, it’s just a consideration when deciding when to send out notices.”  Pls.’ Ex. \nLL [Dkt. # 66-1].  And, indeed, it was a “consideration.”  As Alex Doe reported, members of the \ntermination team contacted OPM immediately and insisted that their counterparts speed up:  \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 71 of 112\n“Thanks for everything you’re doing, but we need the last set of attachments now.  We cannot \nwait until COB.”  Pls.’ Ex. MM [Dkt. # 66-1] (emphasis added);24 see also Mar. 11 Tr. at 52. \nThe hearing began as scheduled, and while the lawyers were addressing the Court or \nconferring with each other during a break that had been provided to see if they could work out a \nshort-term solution themselves, the RIF efforts proceeded apace.  At 2:27 p.m., a list of the \nemployees to be fired was transmitted.  Pls.’ Ex. NN [Dkt. # 66-1].25  But they didn’t get it done \nin time.   \nBy 5:00 p.m., the Court had docketed a consent order negotiated by the parties, which \nprovided that until the Court ruled on plaintiffs’ motion, which was to be deemed a motion for \npreliminary injunction, the defendants could not:  delete, destroy, or impair any data, database or \nother CFPB record; terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the specific \nemployee’s  performance  or  conduct;  issue  any  notice  of  reduction-in-force  to  any  CFPB \nemployee; or transfer, relinquish, or return any money from the CFPB’s reserve funds.  Order (Feb. \n14, 2025) [Dkt. # 19].  Nonetheless, the CFBP RIF team and OMB continued to exchange \ndocuments and nail down the technical details as to how the necessary forms would be completed \nuntil approximately 10:00 pm.  Alex Doe Testimony, Mar. 11 Tr. at 54; see Pls.’ Ex. QQ [Dkt. \n# 66-1] (“[W]e will need to key these over the weekend so they are there Tuesday morning.”). \n \n24   See Martinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 134–35 (Martinez confirms names redacted from \nthe exhibit were members of the termination team). \n \n25   Thirteen employees of the Office of Director/Office of Civil Rights were excepted from \nthe proposed RIF because “[i]n a February 14, 2025, meeting with OPM staff CFPB clarified this \ncompetitive area should be removed from the request.”  Pls.’ Ex. OO [Dkt. # 66-1] at 28 of 60. \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 72 of 112\nMartinez, who had provided a sworn declaration attesting to his personal familiarity with \nthe transition process for new administrations, had to acknowledge at the hearing that none of this \nwas normal. \nTHE COURT: . . . [A]t the beginning of your testimony we talked about the \ninitial email from the secretary of Treasury being [a] pretty normal, kind of \ntransitional kind of email. And the first email from the Acting Director \nVought also, generally, pretty typical. Would you say that sending out an \norder that says “Do no work” is typical?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  No.  \n \nTHE COURT:  Would you say that canceling all the contracts before the \nanalysis as to whether these are duplicative, worthwhile, not worthwhile is \ntypical?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  No.  \n \nTHE COURT:  Would you say that firing all probationary employees and \ntwo-year employees from the get-go is typical?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  No.  \n \nTHE COURT:  Would you say that trying to implement a RIF without \nnotice before the new director is even put in place is typical? \n \nTHE WITNESS:  No.  \n \nTHE COURT:  And would you say putting the rest of the employees on \nadministrative leave with an order to do no work is typical?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  No. \n \nMar. 10 Tr. at 121–22.  He also conceded on cross examination that while he had stated in his \ndeclaration that “new leadership” was working to comply with its statutory functions, “winding \ndown an agency would not be consistent with statutory obligations,” and that they were in fact \nwinding down during the week of February 10.  Mar. 10 Tr. at 126. \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 73 of 112\n(b)  The shutdown did not stop after the consent order was entered \non February 14; the efforts continued as if nothing had changed. \nThe record also establishes that even with the consent order in place, the effort continued \nover the next two weeks; the work stoppage remained in effect, and the shutdown was very much \nalive, although temporarily stalled by the Court. \nEmployees remained on administrative leave, and they were not performing their work \nduties.  See Second Pfaff Decl. [Dkt. # 48-2] ¶ 4 (“None of the activities listed in my original \ndeclaration, including responding to escalated issues via the Escalated Case Management Team, \nare currently happening.”). \nOn February 18, Martinez was informed by the CFPB Chief Information Officer that the \nunavailability of the agency’s home page online was no accident. \nMy understanding is that the decision to delete the home page was made by \nActing Director Vought, and it was not an error made by the members of \nthe DOGE team. \n \nPls.’ Ex. L [Dkt. # 60-1].  \n \n  Furthermore, during the week of February 17, the RIF was still being planned and \ndiscussed.  Alex Doe, who had a poised and calm, but firm demeanor, and came across as \nextremely credible, testified that the RIF team met again on Wednesday, February 19.  Mar. 11 Tr. \nat 54.  Martinez was more focused on the transfer of functions at that meeting, “explaining that he \nhad had conversations with new leadership and the chief legal officer about what the wind-down \nof an agency really meant, and that there were, you know, functions that would need to transfer, \nand OPM was pressing us to identify where those would transfer and we did not yet have an \nanswer.”  Alex Doe Testimony, Mar. 11 Tr. at 55.   \nMR. GUPTA [counsel for plaintiffs]:  Did he refer at this meeting to \nwinding down the Agency?  \n \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 74 of 112\nDOE:  He did.  \n \nMR. GUPTA:  What did you understand that to mean? \n  \nDOE:  Closing of the Agency. . . . \nMR. GUPTA:  And he used that phrase, “the closure of the Agency”?  \nDOE:  He did.   \nMar. 11 Tr. at 56–57.   \nIn the event there was any doubt about the intentions of the executive branch during this \nperiod,  on  February  19,  the  President  reiterated  in  an  interview  with  CBS  News  that  his \nadministration had “virtually shut down the out-of-control CFPB.”  Ex. P to Roston/Scible Decl. \n[Dkt. # 38-17], Lesley Stahl, Why the Consumer Fin. Protection Bureau is being targeted by \nTrump, DOGE, CBS News (Feb. 23, 2025).   \nMartinez supplied more details to agency staff during a meeting on Thursday, February 20. \nAlex Doe testified: \nThe  next  day  we  had  an  internal  meeting  with  some  human  capital \ncolleagues that are not part of the RIF team but we needed to loop them in \n. . . . And in that meeting, he was a lot more specific about what exactly the \nplan was for the Bureau. . . .  \nAdam said there would no longer be a CFPB.  He said that we were \nlegitimately shutting down.  He said that we would be wiped out within 30 \ndays.  He said that the White House had instructed us to cancel all of our \ncommittees and advisory boards and travel cards and purchase cards and to \nonly keep any contracts that were necessary to effectuate the closure of the \nAgency within 30 days. . . . Adam said there would be no positions to \ncompete for.  \n[MR. GUPTA]:  No positions to compete for, you understood that to mean \nbecause the entire divisions would be eliminated?  \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 75 of 112\n[DOE]:  Because the Agency would be eliminated.  He was a lot more \nspecific in that meeting that was just the CFPB.   \nMar. 11 Tr. at 58–59. 26  \nJust as Martinez’s second declaration confirmed the accuracy of Alex Doe’s, his  testimony \nwas consistent with hers as well.  He testified that there were meetings during the week of February \n17 to talk about the RIF.  His understanding was that “the vast majority of the workforce [would] \nbe terminated,” and he was talking with the acting leadership, whom he identified as Paoletta and \nthe DOGE personnel who had been designated as senior leaders of the CFPB, about who would \ninherit the agency’s “administrative portfolio.”  Mar. 10 Tr. at 142–44.  He agreed that he told his \n \n26   The declaration of another employee details what CFPB staff were told in similar terms: \nDuring meetings about the CFPB’s shut-down that took place between \nMonday, February 18 and Tuesday, February 25, staff were told by Senior \nExecutives that the CFPB would be eliminated except for the five statutorily \nmandated positions; that the CFPB would exist in name only; and that, once \nthis  Court’s  injunction  was  over,  everything  would  need  to  be  either \nremoved  from  the  building  or  destroyed.    Staff  were  told  by  Senior \nExecutives that the CFPB would no longer have an employee location and \nthat data could not be stored at any CFPB location because there wouldn’t \nbe any locations left. Staff were told that no DHS, OIG, GAO, OMB, \nInternal Controls, Congressional, or other compliance would be necessary \nbecause the CFPB would “not exist” and it would no longer be “our \nproblem.”  \nDrew Doe Decl. [Dkt. # 38-5] ¶ 7; id. ¶ 10 (“One Senior Executive said that CFPB will become a \n‘room at Treasury, White House, or Federal Reserve with five men and a phone in it.’”). \nMartinez did not vouch for the accuracy of Drew Doe’s account in his supplemental \ndeclaration as he did for the declarations of Alex Doe and Blake Doe.  But he did not dispute it \neither. He offered that he was not aware of the identity of the “senior officials’ described and that \nD. Doe “does not testify that those statements were premised on directive from Acting Director \nVought or the CFPB Chief Legal Officer.”  The declaration also observed that D. Doe’s suggestion \nthat the agency was going to be reduced down to only five positions would be “inconsistent with \nActing Director Vought and the Chief Legal Officer’s directives.” Supp. Decl. of Adam Martinez, \n[Dkt. # 47-1] ¶ 5. \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 76 of 112\ncolleagues at a meeting that week that entire divisions, offices and units were still going to be \nabolished, and that “the impediment to going forward was this Court’s order on the 14th.”  Mar. \n10 Tr. at 145–46.   \nMartinez confirmed that throughout that week, it was still the goal to dismantle the agency \n“as fast as possible.”  Mar. 10 Tr. at 149.  Since the agency had received the requested approval \nfrom OPM to provide its employees with only thirty days’ notice, he told his staff at the \nFebruary 20 meeting that the whole agency would be completely wiped out in thirty days.  Mar. 10 \nTr. at 150.  He conceded at the March 10 hearing that he had no information about the fate of the \nagency’s statutory functions, Mar. 10  Tr. at 149–50, and that but for the Court’s order, the agency \nwould already have been gone:  the process to release the headquarters had begun, and the five \nregional offices were being eliminated.  Mar. 10 Tr. at 152–53.  Martinez, who had been with the \nagency since its inception, seemed to genuinely care about its mission, and as he saw it, once the \nRIF was implemented, the situation would be irreparable; after the RIF, there would not be any \njobs the employees could compete for.  Mar. 10 Tr. at 153. \n  The paper record reflects a number of additional events occurring at a rapid-fire pace: \n  On Thursday, February 20, Jordan Wick sent an email to Paoletta and Vought with the \nsubject:  “More contracts to cut.” (“Please see attached for the next tranche of contracts \nfor which we recommend immediate termination – they’re composed of the following: \n. . . Consumer  Credit  Information  Surveys  and  Panels,  which  will  no  longer  be \nused . . . Various support services (user research and testing, financial mgmt., internal \ncontrols, and identity access software), all of which we can do without.”).  Defs.’ Ex. 10 \n[Dkt. # 66-2], CFPB_00121. \n \n  A February 21 email from a CFPB Realty officer stated that as of that date, the “CFPB’s \nmain focus was ‘moving out of [its] large headquarters building’ on a ‘very very tight \ntime frame . . . (30 days).’”  Diotalevi Decl. ¶ 15.  The Bureau was also moving out of \nits regional offices, beginning with San Francisco.  Id.    \n \n  Also on February 21, the Chief Information Officer wrote to Martinez that the FDIC \nwas asking about the status of the agency’s statutorily required data collection under \nthe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and stated “[w]e are doing our best effort to \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 77 of 112\nsupport the data collection, but it is at risk due to several contracts being terminated. \nWe’ve requested that three of them be turned on, at least temporarily.”  Defs.’ Ex. 6 \n[Dkt. # 56-1] at Page 9 of 116, CFPB_0009. \n \n  Notwithstanding the fact that the building was closed, on February 26, employees were \ninformed that they would lose their ability to work remotely in two days.  See Pls.’ \nEx. M [Dkt. # 60-1] (“The Citrix Virtual Desktop will be unavailable after Friday, \nFebruary 28, 2025, at 11:59 PM EST.”).  This is the program that enables employees \nto log in securely when they are not at a CFPB computer.  Diotalevi Decl. ¶ 20. \n \n  And on Thursday, February 27, employees were told that it was time to pick up their \nbelongings for good.  See Pls.’ Ex. O [Dkt. # 60-1] (“Subject:  Pickup of Personal \nBelongings and Return of Equipment from the CFPB HQ . . . We recognize that you \nhave personal property, work materials, and federal records in your office or cubicle. \nTo prepare to vacate the building, the Operations team has packed up your personal \nbelongings for pickup at 1700 G Street.”). \n \n  By March 3, purchase cards were cut off.  See Defs.’ Ex. 29 [Dkt. # 56-1], CFPB_0098. \nIt was not until February 27, two weeks after the Court’s order concerning the deletion of \ndata, that the Chief Information Security Officer instructed agency staff to identify whether CFPB \ndata or records were at risk of being deleted due to contract terminations, Feb. 27 Email, Defs.’ \nEx. 18 [Dkt. # 56-1] CFBP_00037, and a number of offices responded to express concerns about \nthe loss of data needed for litigation or EEO compliance and uncertainty about whether it was too \nlate to revive the contracts.  See, e.g., Feb. 28 Email, Defs.’ Ex. 19 [Dkt. # 56-1] CFBP_00041; \nMar. 10 Tr. at 179–81.  The testimony also revealed that GSA’s cut-off of purchase cards hampered \nthe agency’s ability to pay its bills and preserve historical data.  See Mar.  10 Tr. at 183–84. \nThe defendants have highlighted a number of emails to suggest that after the blanket orders \nrelating to work and contracts were issued on February 10 or 11, agency leadership circled back \nand took steps to approve certain activities or reactivate specific contracts related to statutorily \nmandated  activities.  The  Court  acknowledges  that  the  new  leadership  relented  in  some \ncircumstances when its employees insisted that the agency was legally required to complete some \naspects of its work, see, e.g., Feb. 27 email from Paoletta to Office of Fair Lending, Defs.’ Ex. 13 \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 78 of 112\n[Dkt. # 56-1], CFPB_00029 (approving certain work, although the email contained the caveat, \n“[a]ny action or communication to an outside party should be sent to me and Daniel Shapiro for \nreview and approval before being transmitted”), or when they discovered – after the notices to \nterminate contracts had already been sent – that certain contracts clearly supported statutory \nfunctions.  See Feb. 20 Email, Defs.’ Ex. 51 [Dkt. # 66-2], CFPB_00120.  \nThese appropriate steps by the new leadership are a matter of record, but the Court cannot \nfind that they reflect that the ship changed course, or that the administration ever abandoned its \nplan to shut the CFPB down.  If anything, the scramble to revive legally required activities serves \nto underscore how complete the shutdown was as of February 10, and how little thought and \nattention was given to any particular contract or agency activity before it was eliminated. See Mar. \n10 Tr. at 71–72 (“THE COURT:  So is it fair to say that there’s thought going into it but only after, \nit’s like shoot first and ask questions later?  MARTINEZ:  That’s what it felt like.”). \nAlso, a close examination of the materials in the record reveals that the approvals were \nnarrow and grudging, and primarily related to operations – databases, phones, facilities, and human \nresources – but not the staffing or outward facing communications that had been in place to serve \nconsumers directly.  In other words, when it was doing anything, the agency was largely doing \nwhat  was  statutorily  mandated  to  manage  itself  internally:    responding  to  FOIA  requests, \nmaintaining  records,  complying  with  regimens  governing  employment  and  accommodating \ndisabled employees.  See, e.g., Feb. 21 Email from Martinez to Sonya White, Defs.’ Ex. 5 [Dkt. \n# 56-1] CFPB_00007 (“Legal Division is authorized to support all operational matters being \nexercised on behalf of our new leadership and our regulatory/statutory requirements, including:  \nProcurement/Contract Actions, Financial Management Actions, Human Capital Actions, Labor \nRelations Actions, Technology and Infrastructure Support, Administrative Operations Actions \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 79 of 112\n(Security, Facilities, Maintenance), Data Governance/Administration, EEO Processing Counsel \nSupport, Reasonable Accommodation Counsel Support,” but “mission related support should be \ncoordinated directly through Mark or Dan.”) (emphasis added); see also Feb. 27 Email, Defs.’ \nEx. 26 [Dkt. # 56-1], CFPB_00062 (specifying that External Affairs team has been “1) reviewing \ncontracts for termination, (2) terminating the advisory councils and (3) prepping and packing 1700 \nG Street due to the termination of the lease, a few other things:  unless otherwise directed, we will \nabide by the guidance issued and will continue to raise items that are statutorily mandated”). \nIt is also notable that when the agency solicited information about contracts that needed to \nbe revived to fulfill statutory directives, those communications were not particularly inviting. \nEmployees were admonished that the agency was taking a “very narrow approach,” and that “if \nyou’re providing justifications, please be prepared to defend those to external parties.” See, e.g., \nMar. 3 Email, Defs.’ Ex. 29 [Dkt. # 56-1] CFPB_00098–99  (“In general we are very narrowly \nturning back contracts (or portions of contracts) that directly support statutory requirements. . . \nSpecifically can you outline for each contract what (statutorily required) action will not be able to \nbe accomplished at all without the contract?

I will send out guidance soon for your awareness,” \nMar. 3 Email, Defs.’ Ex. 38 [Dkt. # 56-1] CFPB_00096, the Chief Operating Officer, Martinez, \ntestified that he did not believe that any such guidance had been provided.  Mar. 10 Tr. at 85.27 \n  In the weeks after February 14, while limited activities related to the shutdown continued \nto move forward, and while the basic operational support needed as the agency tottered on its last \nlegs was being provided, most staff members were complying with the February 10 directive and \nnot  performing  their  ordinary  work  to  advance  the  mission  of  the  agency.    On  Thursday, \nFebruary 26, plaintiffs submitted a declaration from Matthew Pfaff, the Chief of Staff of the Office \nof Consumer Response, “the unit responsible for ‘the centralized collection of, monitoring of, and \nresponse  to  consumer  complaints,’  as  well  as  sharing  data,  as  required  by  12  U.S.C. \n§5493(b)(3)(A)-(D).”28  First Pfaff Decl. ¶ 1.  He took issue with the representations in the first \nMartinez  declaration,  and  he  reported  that  Consumer  Response  complied  with  the  Acting \nDirector’s February 10 direction that staff “not perform any work tasks.”  \nAs a result of this compliance, the operations related to the Consumer \nComplaint Database are not continuing.  And many of the contracts needed \nfor work related to the Consumer Complaint database have not remained \nintact and operational.    \n \n \n27   It turned out that reactivating contracts was easier said than done.  See Feb. 28 Email, Defs.’ \nEx. [Dkt. # 56-1] CFBP_00040 (“Some vendors that were asked to ‘turn back on’ operations were \nable to, others cannot be back on so easily.”). \n28    “When individuals or their representatives submit a complaint to the CFPB, the complaint \nis submitted to and included in a case management system. This case management system allows \nconsumers, companies, and the CFPB to securely share information and engage in the complaint \nprocess. This case management system is also how both the CFPB and companies can deliver \ntimely responses to consumers as required by law. Information from the case management system \npopulates other systems to meet data sharing requirements with federal and state agencies, as well \nas with the public via the Consumer Complaint Database. People – both federal employees and \ncontractors – make this entire operation run successfully.”  First Pfaff Decl. ¶ 8. \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 81 of 112\nId. ¶ 9 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in original).  He averred that on February 13, he \nprepared  a  list  of  the  teams  within  Consumer  Response  that  “align  to  specific  statutory \nobligations,” and that as of the 27th, none of those teams had been activated to work.  “As a result, \nthe complaint handling operation has experienced a significant disruption”: \nComplaints  referred  by  congressional  offices,  states,  and  most  federal \nagencies are not being review and sent to companies. These complaints \nrequire federal staff to review and process.   \nComplaints about companies that are not yet participating in the complaint \nprogram are not being addressed. These complaints require federal staff \nreview and a manual invitation to participate in the program. . . .   \nIncomplete complaints are not being processed or worked by anyone. These \ncomplaints  require  federal  staff  to  conduct  outreach  to  consumers  for \nadditional information. . . . \nComplaints are not being “monitored.” Consumer Response has a team of \nsubject matter experts who monitor complaints to ensure that consumers are \nreceiving timely, accurate, and complete responses to their complaints. \nSubject matter experts also monitor complaints for emergent issues across \nmarket and at companies. This ongoing monitoring provides a necessary \ncheck  on  the  complaint  program  to  ensure  that  consumers  receive \nmeaningful responses. Without this work, company responses are likely \ndeclining in quality. . . . \nEscalated issues are not being addressed. Consumer Response’s Escalated \nCase Management team responds to consumers who are facing imminent \nforeclosure, may be a risk to other or themselves, and other sensitive issues. \nComplaint systems, including the case management system and systems for \nsharing data, are not being maintained. Complaint systems require federal \nand contractor staff to monitor and respond to issues affecting system \nhealth.  Automatically  generated  error  notices  indicate  the  system  has \nalready experienced problems. If these errors are not addressed, at some \npoint, the system will break entirely. Additionally, companies that receive \ncomplaints through this system have received error notices that they are \nunable to export complaints out of the system, which will impede their \nability to review and respond to complaints. \nStakeholder support tickets are not being resolved. Consumer Response \nreceives  hundreds  of  support  tickets  every  month  from  company, \ncongressional, and government stakeholders. Support tickets range from \ncompanies  trying  to  remedy  potential  privacy  concerns  to  resetting \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 82 of 112\npasswords. These tickets are not being reviewed and resolved, which is \nalmost certainly frustrating the ability of stakeholders to complete their \nwork. . . . \nComplaints submitted by servicemembers and their families are not being \nmonitored.  It  is  my  understanding  that  no  one  from  the  Office  of \nServicemember Affairs has been activated to work. \nStudent loan complaints are not being reviewed and informally resolved. \nThe Student Loan Ombudsman role is vacant. Mr. Martinez seemingly \nsuggests that the CFPB Ombudsman is an appropriate substitute. \nAudits and quality controls have halted. Consumer Response maintains an \naudit function that ensures complaint processes and procedures are being \nfollowed, and vendors are appropriately interacting with members of the \npublic. \nActivities to monitor and safeguard the system to prevent bad actors from \nmisusing it have stopped. \nFirst Pfaff Decl. ¶¶ 12–13, 15, 17, 19–21, 23–26. \nIt was not until after that, on Thursday, February 27, that “the Chief Legal Officer activated \nwork related to compliance with the agency’s critical statutory responsibilities in the area of the \nOffice of Consumer Response.”  Second Martinez Decl. ¶ 8.

R [Dkt. # 60-1] at Page 44 of 107 (email stating “[t]he other offices in \nRMR have received notification from their management that Adam Martinez changed his guidance \nand we are now allowed to work on statutorily mandated work”), and they saw through the effort \nto pretend that the February 8 directions had never been superseded.

And yet, shortly after some employees learned they had been \nreactivated, they received instructions to ignore the new guidance until further notice.  See Pls.’ \nEx. S [Dkt. # 60-1] (“In response to Adam Martinez’s email, John has instructed us to stand down \nuntil further notice.”); see also Francis Doe Decl. ¶ 6. \n  As the emails were circulating within the agency, no one had any illusions about the RIF \nwaiting in the wings.  See Mar. 1 Teams Exchange [Dkt. # 70-1] at Page 1 of 2, CFPB 00131 \n(message from Chris Young to Martinez “just trying to get a sense of our status,” and inquiring, \n“[s]hould the judge lift the TRO on March 3rd, are we prepared to implement the RIF?”). \nAs Alex Doe testified on March 11, the RIF team met with OPM and Martinez again on \nthe February 27th. \n[W]e discussed some guidance that came out from Acting Director Vought, \nbut in his OMB capacity. It was giving him guidance about RIFs for federal \nagencies. . . .  \n[Adam] said he would discuss it further with acting leadership and that he \nwould let us know – “us” being the RIF team both at CFPB and at OPM – \nthat he would let us know if the plan changed.  \nAnd that has never – to this day has never happened.   \nMar. 11 Tr. at 60.   \n(c)  Paoletta’s  March  2  email  suggesting  that  employees  were \nsupposed to be working all along has little evidentiary value.  \n  As the March 1 email to Martinez reflects, agency leadership was well-aware that a hearing \non the pending motion for preliminary injunction – which had been supported by declarations \nswearing that as of February 10, work had been stopped – was scheduled to take place Monday, \nMarch 3 at 10:00 am.  At 4:18 on the afternoon of Sunday, March 2, the agency’s Chief Legal \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 85 of 112\nOfficer was moved to address “all hands” who were still on deck.  Like Martinez, Paoletta invoked \nthe February 8 email as if it was still the operative document.  But his email also included a \nstunning mischaracterization of the February 10 order:   \nOn behalf of Acting Director Vought, I am writing to you to ensure that \neveryone is carrying out any statutorily required work, as he set forth in his \nFebruary 8th email. \n \nOn February 8, 2025, you received an email from Acting Director Vought \ndirecting you to halt several classes of work unless “required by law” or \nexpressly approved by the Acting Director.  On February 10, 2025, you \nreceived an email from Acting Director Vought directing you to reach \nout to me for the authorization required by the February 8 email. These \nmeasures were intended to ensure that new leadership could establish \noperational control over the agency while ensuring that it would continue to \nfulfill its statutory duties. Many of you understood this and continued to \nperform functions required by law and sought approval from me to perform \nwork, which I have promptly granted. \n \nIt has come to my attention, however, that some employees have not been \nperforming statutorily required work. Let me be clear:  Employees should \nbe performing work that is required by law and do not need to seek prior \napproval to do so.  If you have any questions, please reach out to me \nimmediately, and I will promptly give you an answer and authorization if \nwarranted. If you are aware of other employees that are needed to assist you \nin performing a statutorily required task but are not doing so, please raise \nthis with me immediately. \n \nThank you for your attention to this matter \n \nMar. 2 Email, Defs.’ Ex. 25 [Dkt. # 56-1] CFPB_00058 (emphasis added). \nPaoletta’s description of the February 10 order cannot be squared with the plain language \nof the Vought directive, nor is it consistent with the manner in which the February 10 order was \nunderstood by the staff, implemented by the agency, or used to justify massive layoffs.   \n  After being ordered to “stand down from performing any work task,” the employees \nstood down. \n \n  Probationary and term employees were fired in accordance with the February 10 \norder. \n \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 86 of 112\n  The  remaining  agency  employees  were  placed  on  administrative  leave  in \naccordance with the order. \n \n  The agency called for the immediate cancellation of contracts because of the order. \n \n  The agency justified the need for a shortened notice period before a RIF of just \nunder 1200 employees by pointing to the order.  \n \n  Employees would remain on administrative leave for that thirty-day period in \nconformance with the order.  \n \n  The agency cancelled meetings with consumers in need of assistance, including \nPastor Steege, because of the order. \n \n  The fact that Paoletta expounded upon the February 10 order for the first time almost three \nweeks after it was issued, and the fact that he suddenly did so on a weekend afternoon immediately \nbefore  the  Court  was  scheduled  to  hear  the  case,  support  an  inference  that  the  March  2 \ncharacterization was not what the order was intended to mean all along.  Also, Paoletta’s new spin \non the order does not make sense:  if the February 8 directive authorizing the performance of \nstatutory duties was supposed to remain in force, there would have been no need to issue the \nFebruary 10 email at all.  \nFurthermore, Paoletta insults the reader’s intelligence when he feigns surprise that few \nemployees were working.  See Mar. 10 Tr. at 204 (Martinez testified that as of the date the email \nwas sent, “honestly, I knew there was a good portion of the agency that was not working”). \nFurthermore, Martinez testified that the stop work order was never rescinded.  Mar. 10 Tr. at 184.  \nDefendants’  suggestion  that  the  plaintiffs  and  agency  staff  simply  misread  or \nmisunderstood the February 10 email is belied by the fact that when the CFPB, under the direction \nof  its  Acting  Director,  Russell  Vought,  provided  Vought’s  OPM  with  the  justification  for \naccelerating a RIF of all but the employees needed to implement the RIF, it pointed to that very \n“work stoppage order.”  See Pls.’ Ex. OO [Dkt. # 66-1] at Page 28 of 60.  It is also belied by the \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 87 of 112\nFebruary 10 email sent to Martinez by the Chief Information Officer Christopher Chilbert, Feb. 10 \nEmail, Defs.’ Ex.  1 [Dkt. # 56-1] CFPB_0001, twenty minutes after Vought’s email was received.  \nHe identified the minimum level of support his office should be providing “based on this email,” \nand it involved supporting DOGE and the new leadership, providing security monitoring for the \nnetworks,  and  making  sure  that  the  agency’s  essential  technology  was  operational.

See, e.g., Feb. 27 Email, Defs.’ Ex. 12 [Dkt. \n# 56-1] CFPB_00026 (from a Senior Enforcement Attorney and Military Affairs Liaison:  “I’ve \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 88 of 112\nwritten previously on other issues; please do not take this email as insubordination. I request \npermission to perform the following urgent work tasks . . . .).29  \nThe defendants’ attempt to intimidate the employees was on full display in the courtroom \nwhen Pfaff, the head of the Office of Consumer Response, was subjected to a  cross examination \nthat insinuated that the shutdown of the statutorily  required consumer complaint system – the \nheartbeat of the agency subscribed to by more than 70 stakeholders, Members of Congress, and \nstate regulators, and the only existing means within the federal government to resolve the over \n350,000 consumer complaints per year – was his fault.  The witness handled this audacious attempt \nto blame the closure of the most important office in the agency on him with aplomb: \nMR. HOLLAND (counsel for defendants):  In your first declaration, do you \nrecall in paragraph 9 characterizing this email as directing staff not to \nperform any work tasks and to stand down from performing any work task? \n \n29   See also Monday, Mar. 3, 10:02 a.m. email from Cassandra Huggins of Supervision \ncomparing Martinez’s Feb. 27 email with Vought’s Feb. 8 email and asking, “Please confirm that \nthe message you sent is not intended to authorize the reinstatement of supervision/examination \nactivity despite the fact that the Bureau is required by law to conduct these activities.”  Defs.’ \nEx. 33  [Dkt.  #  56-1]  at  Page  82  of  116,  CFPB_00082.

I did \nnot provide this email to the media, and I do not know who did.  I did not intend to undermine the \nnew administration's ability to supervise agency staff- my only intention was to ensure that our \nstaff did not act against the direction in the February a email from Acting Director Vought to cease \nall supervisory and examination activity.”  Id.  \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 89 of 112\n \nPFAFF:  Correct. \n \nMR. HOLLAND:  But the email says more than that, doesn't it? \n \nPFAFF:  The email says to get approval in writing before doing any work \ntasks. It also says, “Please alert me through Mark Paoletta if there are any \nurgent matters.” \n \nMR. HOLLAND:  “If there are urgent matters please alert me through Mark \nPaoletta,” right? \n \nPFAFF:  Yes. \n \nMR. HOLLAND:  Despite that directive, you did not contact Mark Paoletta \nfor consumer response approval to address all of the urgent and piling-up \nconsumer complaints; isn't that right? \n \nPFAFF:  I understood “urgent” to mean something out of the nonordinary \ncourse of business. \n \nMR. HOLLAND:  You didn't think that, like, someone not being able to \nhave their, like, imminent foreclosure complaint addressed was urgent? \n \nPFAFF:  I consider it urgent, but I would – I would remind you that 1013 \ncreates an obligation on the director to create the unit that over sees the \nhandling of complaints. \n \nMar. 11 Tr. at 94.30 \n \nAll in all, Paoletta’s claim in the March 2 email that the stop work order was something \nother than a clear order to cease agency actions across the board proved to be unsustainable.  And \nthe evidence showed that emails purporting to get things up and running again could not be taken \non face value, either, as the employees found out that being reactivated on paper did not mean they \ncould actually do the work. \nTHE  COURT:    We’ve  [got  an]  email  from  the  head  of  Research, \nMonitoring, and Regulation on March 3rd, after they were all told on March \n \n30   Counsel  asked  additional  questions  pointedly  blaming  the  work  stoppage  on  other \nemployees instead of the Acting Director.

He said we would do it, but we lost our people.  We lost our \ncontractors and we lost our data. \n \nOn February 27, after he said everybody do your statutory-authorized work, \nthe Consumer Response Center said, yeah, but we need the people. \n \nMARTINEZ:  Right. \n \nTHE COURT:  We can’t do it without people. Office of Fair Lending said \nwe can’t do what we did do without talking to people, but we have to get \npermission to talk to people.  \n \nMARTINEZ:  Right. \n \nTHE COURT:  So, just saying statutory-authorized doesn’t really answer \nthe question, does it? \n \nMARTINEZ:  No. \n \nMar. 10 Tr. at 76–77.  See also Mar. 3 Email, Pls.’ Ex. Y [Dkt. # 60-1] (listing the challenges faced \nby Research, Monitoring, and Regulation in resuming its work, including inter alia, “[l]oss of \npersonnel.  The firing of much of our staff impacts our ability to complete assignments as planned. \n. . ;” “[l]oss of IT.  Several contracts that have supported our work have been cancelled. . .;” [and]  \n“[l]oss of data.  Several of our data contracts have been cancelled. . . .”).  \n(d)  The  suggestion  in  the  Chief  Operating  Officer’s  March  2 \nsupplemental declaration that the situation had changed with \nthe arrival of new “adults in the room” is not persuasive, since \nthe agency has been managed by the same people all along.  The \nagency is still at risk, and Martinez lacks personal knowledge of \nany facts to support his “hope” that it is not.   \nThere was additional drafting for the Court’s consumption on Sunday, March 2.  Since \nplaintiffs had filed supplemental declarations casting doubt on Martinez’s first declaration with \ntheir February 27 reply, see Pls.’ Suppl. Decls. [Dkt. # 38-1–17], defendants docketed a second \ndeclaration from Martinez in response at 4:33 p.m.  See Second Martinez Decl.  This time, the \nagency had Martinez admit that the accounts  submitted by plaintiffs’ declarants were “not \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 91 of 112\ninaccurate,” and he agreed that in fact, he had referred to the “closure of the agency” during the \nweek of February 10.  Id. ¶ 3.  But he attributed that information and those events to DOGE: \nPrior to Russell Vought’s designation as Acting Director of CFPB, agency \nstaff had received guidance from DOGE-associated personnel consistent \nwith those statements, which I believed at the time to reflect the position of \nagency leadership, and continued to believe reflect agency leadership’s \nposition for a brief time thereafter. \n \nId. ¶ 3.  Martinez maintained that “new leadership,” though, was taking a more methodical \napproach, “taking time to assess, listen, and explore the state of the Bureau.”  Id. ¶ 4.   \nThe  contradiction  at  the  heart  of  these  statements  is  apparent  from  the  face  of  the \ndeclaration, which also reminds the Court that Vought became Acting Director on February 7 – \nbefore the actions that took place the week of February 10.  Id.  Yet the Chief Operating Officer \ntried to maintain: “[r]ather than a closure of the agency, Acting Director Vought’s new leadership \nhas focused on running a substantially more streamlined and efficient bureau, refocusing its \npriorities, and ‘right sizing’ of the agency.”  Id.  \nMartinez’s suggestion that it was all a misunderstanding that got cleared up when new \nleadership stepped in was undermined by exhibits showing that current leadership was the engine \nbehind the shutdown in the first place, and that Vought or Paoletta was involved in every step \nalong the way.  After the plaintiffs’ second round of declarations blew huge holes in his assertions, \nMartinez was forced to concede on the stand that when it came to anything other than the \noperations under his purview, he did not have personal knowledge about what was actually going \non.  \nWhen asked about the statement in paragraph 22 of his first declaration that “operations \nrelated to the consumer complaint database [were] continuing,” he explained he was only talking \nabout operations – “what the minimum requirement was to ensure that the site didn’t go down or \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 92 of 112\nif the public could still access some form of complaint . . .[;] what was necessary to keep the \ndatabase going” and “to keep the lights on.”  Martinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 196.  \nTHE COURT:  So in that paragraph 22 of your first declaration where you \ntalked about the Bureau’s maintaining the toll-free number, the website, the \ndatabase, operations related to the database are continuing, contracts needed \nfor work related to the database have remained intact and operational, all \nyou were intending to convey was the operations side? Again, not the \nprogramming. \n \nMARTINEZ:  That is correct. \nId. at 197–98.   \nTHE COURT:  Assuming it’s open, is it fair to say that [the hotline] [is] \nonly as good as the response to what people leave on the hotline? . . . [I]t’s \ngreat that the hotline is always open, it needs to be opened, it’s statutorily \nauthorized and required.  But how it’s working is a question that’s different \nfrom whether it’s open. \n \nMARTINEZ:  Correct. I don’t have the inside knowledge to know who \npicks up the phone and who provides advice or what they do on the back \nend of that. \n \nId. at 91–92.  After Martinez could not answer questions about not only Consumer Response, but \nalso the Research Division and the Office of Markets, see id. at 224–28, counsel for plaintiffs \nasked, “So in general . . . just to be really clear, and that way I’ll stop asking you specific questions, \nall of the offices in the mission side of the organization, you don’t have insight into what’s \nhappening on the ground?” \nMARTINEZ:  I have no insight. I usually don’t have insight into those \nspecific groups. Again, those groups have historically, over the last four \nyears,  reported  to  the  chief  of  staff.  That’s  an  entirely  different \nprogrammatic SME, subject matter expert, responsibility. \n \nId. at 228. \nMartinez also explained on cross examination that when it came to his conversations with \nPaoletta about reinstating contracts, his knowledge was limited to “a small number of technology \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 93 of 112\ncontracts[;]”  “[t]he  only  contracts  that  I  know  that  I  reviewed  were  some  that  I  reviewed \nspecifically with Mark Paoletta, who needed some guidance about operational contracts.”  Id. \nat 171–72. \nMartinez was asked about the statement in paragraph 19 of his new declaration that “[o]ur \nleadership has worked to comply with statutorily-required functions”: \nMS. BENNETT:  So when you said that, your information . . . it’s just based \non what Mark Paoletta told you, right? \n \nMARTINEZ:  Yes, yes. \nMS. BENNETT:  It’s not based on any insight into the mission side of the \nagency, right? \n \nMARTINEZ:  Not at all. \nMS. BENNETT:  Okay. And, in fact, at that time, if you know, most of the \nfunctions were not up and running, right? \n \nMARTINEZ:  That’s what I know now. \nId. at 187–88.  \n \nThe Court does not need to find, and it is not inclined to find, that Martinez intentionally \nlied.  His second declaration and his sworn live testimony during the hearing acknowledged the \ntruth of what the plaintiffs’ witnesses were saying, and once on the stand, he freely admitted what \nhe did not know.  At times, he appeared anguished by both the demise of the agency and by his \nbeing cast in the role of agency spokesman; there were multiple painful pauses when you could \nsee the battle between his conflicting loyalties to his new employers and to the truth playing out \non his face, and he grimaced or turned red before he answered.  He had the demeanor of an abused \nwife brought to court by her husband to drop the charges. \nMoreover, Martinez’s testimony established that he has no idea what the leadership of the \nagency is planning beyond firing all of the employees.  He is well aware that even though there \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 94 of 112\nwas no RIF on February 14, the RIF team is still meeting.  See id. at 231–32.  And he agreed with \nplaintiffs’ counsel summary:  “[s]o you are saying . . . not that the plan to terminate the vast \nmajority of the employees is off the table, but that . . . they are taking into account the procedural \nrequirements in a way that they may not have before?”  MARTINEZ:  “Yes.”  Id. at 232.  When \nasked if it was his testimony that Acting Director Vought and Paoletta “do not currently intend to \nwind down the agency,” he did not answer the question directly. \nMARTINEZ:  My understanding is that they have recognized that there are \nstatutory requirements that need to be fulfilled within the agency, but I don’t \nknow how many people, I don’t know what functions.  I have no knowledge \nof what their thinking is right now in terms of capacity or size of the agency. \nBut, yes, my understanding is that they are committed to fulfilling the \nstatutory requirements of the Agency.  \n \nMS. BENNETT:  Okay. But you have no idea what that means to them, \nright?  \n \nMARTINEZ:  I have no idea what that means.  I will find out once we’re \nbuilding out this report that needs to go to OMB with regards to the \nreduction in force across the federal government.  But I have no idea as of \nright now what they’re thinking. . . .  \n \nTHE COURT:  And you don’t know whether that means . . . they recognize \nthat they will be fulfilled by the CFPB or if finding a home in some other \nagency does the trick?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  Correct.  \n \nTHE COURT:  You don’t know what they’re thinking on that?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  I have no idea. \n \nId. at 229–30. \n \n  Martinez did have a good understanding of the impact Paoletta’s March 2 missive had on \nthe surprised agency employees. \nTHE COURT: . . . [T]hen it’s 3:30 p.m. on the Sunday before the last \nhearing when [Paoletta] goes:  Do your statutorily-required work and you \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 95 of 112\ndon't have to ask anybody for permission first.  So up until that point they \nstill had to ask for permission? \n \nTHE WITNESS:  That was my understanding of what people were doing, \nyes.  \n \nTHE COURT:  And what happened after that – it went out Sunday, it looks \nlike on Monday, while we were all here in court, a lot of the supervisors are \nsaying, well, wait, what do you mean?  Do I have to ask permission?  Do I \nnot have to ask permission? There was a little bit of confusion going on in \nthe building. Is that fair to say? \n \nTHE WITNESS:  There was a lot of confusion in the building.  \n \nTHE COURT:  Would you say there’s still a lot of confusion in the \nbuilding?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  I would say, from a lot of accounts, there’s still a [lot] of \nconfusion about what’s going on. \n \n*  *  * \nBY MR. ROSENBERG [counsel for defendants]:  Would you say that \nthere’s less confusion today than there was a couple week ago as to what \nfunctions –  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  There’s less confusion today.  I think there’s hope.  I have \nhope for the future.  I think that people are – I think people want to go back \nto work and they want to do the work they were hired to do.  \n \nTHE COURT:  So sitting here right now, you think there’s still people not \nworking?  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  It would not surprise me if there were people still not \nworking.  \n \nTHE COURT:  I think I asked you this earlier:  You can’t tell me how many \npeople have come off administrative leave to do this statutorily-authorized \nwork that everybody is committed to having them do.  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  I cannot answer that, ma’am. \n \nId. at 66–68. \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 96 of 112\n  On re-direct examination the next morning, the witness returned to his theme of the salutary \neffects of having adults in the room, but that did not amount to much after follow-up questioning. \nMARTINEZ: . . . If there’s anything positive out of any of this, it’s that we \nhave a better understanding and an inventory of what the cause and effect \ncould be in the future for turning off specific contracts and the devastation \nit could have on the Agency.   So we have a lot more information today than \nwe had before that.  And all of this is happening through adults at the table \nthat were able to interact with that understands how government is supposed \nto run and is savvy enough to know the consequences of not following \nnormal  government  protocol,  which,  in  my  opinion,  is  the  public,  its \naccountability  with  the  public,  obviously  with  the  court  system,  but \nCongress as well.  \n \nTHE COURT:  But I thought you told me yesterday that while this is not \nbeing done in as rushed a fashion . . . [t]he end game is to end up with no \nCFPB, and the very important functions, they will go somewhere else.  \n \nMARTINEZ:  That was the week of the 10th. \n \nTHE COURT:  Well, I thought the week of the 10th was just no CFPB. But \nI thought you’re saying, they’re still talking about how do we get rid of the \nemployees – we’re going to keep the contracts we need until this is done, \nbut how do we get this down so that whatever has to be gone to some other \nagency can go, but we’re not going to be here?  \n \nMARTINEZ:  The week of the 10th, that was absolutely correct.  But the \nother question –  \n \nTHE COURT:  All right.  Well, yesterday I got the distinct impression that \nyou were saying they’re doing it in a much more methodical fashion, but \nthat’s the goal.  \n \nMARTINEZ:  The goal, as I understand – I don’t have what the end goal is \nfor this team right now.  \n \nTHE COURT:  Okay. So you don’t know. . . . \n \nMARTINEZ:  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  I – what I know is that we have \nOMB guidance that we’ve been directed to follow, and I don’t know what \nthey’re going to mandate as part of that.  I just – I have absolutely no clue \nwhat the end result is for the Bureau. \n \nId. at 23–25. \n \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 97 of 112\nAt end of his testimony, then, all that was left of Martinez’s ability to attest that the agency \nwould continue to do its work was a “hope,” and a hope grounded in little or no information. \n(e)  The Court cannot stay its hand based on defendants’ assurances \nthat statutorily mandated work is being performed, because \ndefendants now claim that they do not know what that means. \n  In its opposition, and throughout the hearings on the motion, the defense was adamant that \nno injunction was needed since employees had repeatedly been instructed that they could, and \nshould, perform statutory mandated duties, and that was what was happening.  At the conclusion \nof the evidentiary hearing, the Court asked if that was the case, why would the defendants object \nto the provision in plaintiffs’ proposed interim order that the agency should not interfere with, \nprohibit, or suspend the employees’ performance of those mandated duties?  \nTHE COURT:  I’m saying something about their claims makes me want to \nhave interim relief, and you’re telling me, “There is nothing to see here, \nJudge, because we are all in on statutorily required duties.”  What is \noffensive about an order confirming that?  \n \nMR. ROSENBERG:  There is ambiguity as to what the scope of those \nstatutorily required duties are. \n \nId. at 115.  This took the Court by surprise, and counsel tried to backpedal a little bit. \nTHE  COURT:    So  you’re  saying  that  every  one  of  these  emails  is \nambiguous that you’ve been showing me all day, and the order that was \nissued on February 27th and the order that was issued on March 2nd are \nambiguous?  \n \nMR. ROSENBERG:  No. \nId. at 116.  But then he reiterated, “[i]t’s too broad to know.  It’s vague.”  Id. at 117.  \nTHE  COURT:    Does  the  director  –  acting  director  of  the  Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, today, know what the statutorily required \nduties are?  And did Mr. Paoletta know when he sent out the emails that you \nhave asked me to rely on and to comfort me that the statutorily required \nduties are under control, does that have meaning for you or does that not \nhave a meaning for you?  \n \n97 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 98 of 112\nMR. ROSENBERG:  It has a meaning in the sense that the Agency’s \noperations are broad. \n \nId.  As counsel explained it, it was up to the employees to tell the leaders of the agency what its \nduties were.  Id.31 \n  The frustrating exchange on this subject ended with the following: \nTHE COURT: . . . [T]he fact that you all agreed to something that became \na court order . . . had a direct and immediate effect on the dismantling of \nthis  agency,  your  own  witness  testified  to  that,  your  own  documents \ndemonstrate that.  But the conversation hasn’t ended.  It’s continued.  So, \nthe question is:  What is the appropriate thing to order?  And it seems to me \nthat you’re saying the term “statutory obligations” is too broad and not \nenforceable. . . . [Y]ou’re also saying I don’t have the authority to do it, but \nif I think I have the authority to do it under the unique circumstances of this \ncase, are you telling me you don’t know what they mean?  \n \nMR. ROSENBERG:  Yes. \n \nId. at 123–24.  \nWith that, what little was left of the defendants’ contention they were intent on doing what \nthe law required them to do collapsed like a balloon at the end of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day \nParade.  The defendants cannot expect the Court to be comforted by their recent announcement to \nemployees that they should perform their statutory functions when they are simultaneously \n \n31   See also Mar. 11 Tr. at 120: \nMR.  ROSENBERG:  . . .  that’s  part  of  the  problem  .  .  .  the  statutory \nfunctions that plaintiffs have identified appear to be literally everything that \nthe Agency does.  \n \nTHE COURT: . . . [Y]ou used the term more often than they did.  This term \nis taken straight from the February 27 email . . . and then the March 2nd \nemail, which was actually sent to someone saying . . . , “How can you dare \ndefy my clear order?” . . . So somebody thought it was clear when they \nwrote it in an email.  So somebody in your side knows what it means.   \n \n98 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 99 of 112\ninsisting that the term is so vague, no one – not even the Acting Director of the agency – knows \nwhat it means. \n2.  The plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claims. \nThe same evidence that underlies Count One also establishes a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of the APA claims alleging at least one discrete, final action taken in violation of law and \nwithout a rational basis to support it:  the February 10 order.  The stop work order stopped all \nwork, including statutorily mandated work, and the flurry of emails circulated on the eve of the \nhearing on the motion were little more than a transparent effort to pretend otherwise.  And as the \ndocuments and the witnesses’ testimony revealed, there was little or no analysis undertaken before \nthe employees were ordered to put their pencils down, before all of the agency’s contracts were \ncancelled, see, e.g., Martinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 70–71, before the probationary employees \n99 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 100 of 112\nwere fired, or before the effort to accomplish a complete reduction in force by the end of the week \nwas initiated.32  \nMore importantly, even if some employees did prevail on their management and obtain \npermission to perform some of their mandated duties on some of the days between February 8 and \ntoday, the implementation of the President’s unlawful decision to close the agency has simply been \nslowed, not reversed.  As the defendants are chomping at the bit to wrap things up, it will take \nnothing less than a court order to maintain the status quo pending the resolution of this case.  As \n \n32   It is important to note that, generally, the defendants did not assert in their opposition to \nthe motion that any of this was the product of thoughtful analysis.  They did not suggest that DOGE \nor the new leadership had uncovered fraud or wasteful spending; instead, they tried to persuade \nthe Court that agency was open for business and the employees had been encouraged and \nauthorized to perform their statutory duties all along.  \n \nCounsel did try to tell the Court that when Vought made his decision to stop the flow of \nfunding from the Federal Reserve on Saturday, February 8, his very first day on the job, he \nreviewed information provided by the Chief Financial Officer reflecting the funds available to the \nagency, and he made a decision, “given his expertise in budgetary matters and looking at the \nnecessary  documents,”  and  “consistent  with  his  view  that  he  wanted  to  . . .  make  a  more \nstreamlined and efficient Bureau,” that he had more than enough on hand for the next quarter. Tr. \nof Proceedings (Mar. 3, 2025) [Dkt. # 58] at 53–54.  Counsel advised the Court that “the materials \n[Vought] considered in making that decision” had been provided to the District Court in Maryland \nin opposition to a preliminary injunction motion there.  Id. at 55.  A review of that docket revealed, \nthough, that the Maryland court had been provided with a single piece of paper listing the amount \nof money in the Civil Penalty Fund, which is not available to be used for day-to-day operations, \nand the total of the obligated and unobligated funds on hand comprising the “Bureau Fund.” See \nMayor & City Counsel of Balt. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, Civ. Action No. 25-00458-MJM \n[Dkt. # 29-1].  As of February 8, 2025, the Bureau Fund had a balance of $412,346,065.32 in \nunobligated funds, of which $220,000,000 was internally earmarked for a “reserve fund” for \nfinancial contingencies, which the Acting Director decided on day one to discontinue.  Id.  The \nsubmission did not include any documents concerning expenses or potential contingencies that \nwere relied upon in connection to Vought’s decision that the reserve was superfluous and that the \ncash on hand was sufficient.  On Sunday, employees were informed that the building was closed, \nand on Monday, the first working day of Vought’s tenure, the RIF meetings began and the stop \nwork email was issued.  One could draw a reasonable inference that Vought’s analysis that no \nadditional funds were required was more likely based on his understanding when he assumed the \nposition that soon, the agency would not be operating at all. \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 101 of 112\nMartinez explained, “I now realize how much damage can be done . . . just within a couple of \ndays.”  Id. at 74.  \nB.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm. \nThe second element to be established is that plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  The D.C. Circuit “has set a high \nstandard for irreparable injury” – it “must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not \ntheoretical”  and  it  must  be  “beyond  remediation.”  Chaplaincy  of  Full  Gospel  Churches  v. \nEng., 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006), quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  It explains: \nThe key word in this consideration is irreparable.  Mere injuries, however \nsubstantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended in the \nabsence  of  a  stay  are  not  enough.  The  possibility  that  adequate \ncompensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date, in \nthe  ordinary course  of  litigation  weighs  heavily  against  a  claim  of \nirreparable harm.   \nId. at 297–98 (emphasis in original), quoting Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. FPC, 259 F.2d 921, \n925 (D.C. Cir. 1958).   \nPlaintiffs in this case will face irreparable harm without preliminary relief.  The shutdown \nwill take little more than a month, if that.  The record reflects that the RIF notices giving employees \nthirty days’ notice are ready and waiting.  The decision to place employees on administrative leave \nduring those thirty days has been made, with the understanding that they can be called back not to \nserve consumers, but “to fulfill close out duties.”  Pls.’ Ex. KK.  The CFPB building is already \nclosed, arrangements to cancel the lease and move out in thirty days were made five weeks ago, \nand the technology to work remotely has been cancelled.  Once the agency is gone, there will be \nno opportunity to afford relief at a later point in the litigation.  There will be no opportunity to be \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 102 of 112\nreinstated or rejoin a healthcare plan because there will be no jobs left to compete for after the RIF.  \nThere will be no hotline to call and no one to assist at the other end of the line.   \nBefore the instant motion was filed, the agency was already in “wind-down mode,” \nMartinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 54, firing term and probationary employees and putting most \nof the other employees on administrative leave.  Martinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 128.  They \nalso terminated most of its contracts before walking back a “very narrow” set of those terminations \nin the face of this litigation.  Defs.’ Ex. 38 [Dkt. # 56-1] at Page 96 of 116, CFPB_00096.  The \nrecord shows that reactivating work after just a few weeks of “stop work” has proven difficult; the \nConsumer Response function is experiencing “a large and unprecedented backlog” of more than \n16,000 consumer complaints that will take weeks, if not months, to work through.  First Pfaff Decl. \n¶ 16; Pfaff Testimony, Mar. 11 Tr. at 90–92.  As it stands in its “current state,” defendants’ \nchallenged actions have the Bureau and its functions “hobbl[ing] along.”  Pfaff Testimony, Mar. 11 \nTr. at 91.   \nDefendants remain poised to fire “most of [the] remaining staff, leaving a Bureau that \n[can’t] actually perform any functions, or no Bureau at all.”  Alex Doe Decl. ¶ 3; see Pls.’ Ex.

If its contracts \nare finally terminated, the Consumer Response system will “collapse,” as will other functions of \nthe Bureau.  Pfaff Testimony, Mar. 11 Tr. at 91.  See also Drew Doe Decl. [Dkt. # 38-5] ¶ 6 (stating \nthat “[t]he hasty termination of almost all of the Bureau’s contracts resulted in systems and services \nbeing turned off”); Martinez Testimony, Mar. 10 Tr. at 194–96 (explaining that the contract \nterminations disrupted the CFPB’s statutorily required Home Mortgage Disclosure Act work).  \nAnd if those and other CFPB contracts are fully terminated, they cannot just be turned back on.  \nSee Charlie Doe Decl. ¶ 10.  It will take “six months to a year or more” to enter new contracts.  Id.  \n102 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 103 of 112\nAllowing defendants to execute their plans without preliminary relief will cause irreparable harm \nto the Bureau, the plaintiffs in this case, and plaintiffs’ members and constituents. \nThe NAACP, National Consumer Law Center, and Virginia Poverty Law Center will no \nlonger be able to serve their members and constituents with consumer protection services and \nadvocacy.  VPLC routinely relies on the Consumer Response system to carry out is mission.  See \nSpeer Decl. ¶¶ 10, 15–16, 24.  But the Vought stop work order and contract cancellations has put \nit in peril.  See Pls.’ Ex. Z (stating the CCDB has not had been refreshed with new data since \nFebruary 22); Pfaff Testimony, Mar. 11 Tr. at 91.  The VPLC’s Chief Executive Officer avers that \nit would be “difficult if not impossible” for VPLC to replicate the Consumer Response complaint \ntool – “sending the complaint to the company, backed by a federal agency and with a deadline to \nrespond, while also sending it to other state and federal agencies that may be able to help” – and \nwould strain VPLC’s limited resources.  Speer Decl. ¶ 16.   \nMoreover, both VPLC and NCLC rely on CFPB data and reports to carry out their mission \nand face irreparable harm if that data disappears.  VPLC uses CFPB information “about trends or \nwidespread illegal activities that they have discovered through their consumer complaint process” \nto support its education work, which would be impossible to replicate without access to the \nconsumer complaint database.  Speer Decl. ¶ 23.  NCLC uses CFPB data in its comprehensive \ndigital treatise series, which “is intertwined with CFPB website materials” and “link extensively \nto CFPB materials on the CFPB’s website.”  Dubois Decl. ¶ 9.  It that data were allowed to \ndisappear, “this material will go out of date and not be replaced by updated CFPB resources.”  Id. \n¶¶ 9–10; see also id. ¶¶ 4–5.   \nDefendants’  efforts  to  terminate  the  Bureau’s  contracts  and  other  actions  that  risk \ndestroying CFPB’s data would harm these plaintiffs.  See Pls.’ Ex. EE [Dkt. # 60-1] at Page 95 of \n103 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 104 of 112\n107 (March 4, 2025 email warning “we will lose all historical data on our Google Analytics \nplatform if we don’t pay the bill”); Defs.’ Ex. 6 [Dkt. # 56-1] at Page 9 of 116, CFPB_0009 (Feb. \n21, 2025 email from Christopher Chilbert to Adam Martinez stating, “We are doing our best effort \nto support the data collection, but it is at risk due to several contracts being terminated.”); Defs.’ \nEx. 18 (Feb. 27, 2025) [Dkt. # 56-1] at Page 37 of 116, CFPB_00037 (email directing recipients \n“to identify if CFPB data or records are at risk of being deleted due to contract cancellations”).  \nAnd this harm is irreparable because, as one contracting officer explained, without the parties’ \nMarch 3 agreement, “many of the CFPB’s contracts would have been fully and irrevocably \nterminated by the end of this week” and “the Bureau has not taken any efforts to preserve CFPB \ndata that is possessed by vendors whose contracts are terminated.  Charlie Doe Decl. [Dkt. # 38-4] \n¶¶ 10, 12.   \nShutting down the CFPB would “unquestionably make it more difficult” for VPLC and \nNCLC to accomplish their primary missions, and this harm “provide[s] injury for purposes both \nof standing and irreparable harm.”  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 9. \nFurther, plaintiffs’ members face irreparable harm.  NAACP member Junita West-Tillman \nhas already suffered devastating losses from the Los Angeles wildfires.  West-Tillman Decl. ¶ 2.  \nNow she and other NAACP members are being targeted by mortgage scammers, and she has “had \na difficult time determining what assistance was legitimate and what was fraudulent.”  Id. ¶ 3.  \nWithout the CFPB, which West-Tillman planned to reach out to for assistance, she and others like \nher face the “the financial scams that were rampant post-fire” on their own, Bross Decl. ¶ 3, and \nrisk being “unable to recover money lost to financial predators.”  West-Tillman Decl. ¶ 4.  Further, \na CFPB Employee Association member who defendants terminated will not have health coverage \nif she remains terminated as she seeks to deal with a possible auto-immune condition, see Coll \n104 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 105 of 112\nDecl. ¶ 6, and another employee who is the insured member of her family and faces termination if \ndefendants execute their planned RIF risks losing health coverage for her spouse who has an \nongoing serious medical condition.  See id. ¶ 7.  These harms go beyond mere financial losses that \ncan be paid for later.  Association members and their family members with serious health \nconditions face “great” harm if those conditions are left untreated.  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches, 454 F.3d at 297; see Risteen v. Youth for Understanding, 245 F. Supp. 2d 1, 16 (D.D.C. \n2002) (“The loss of health insurance benefits – particularly for those who are unemployed – \nconstitutes irreparable harm[.]”).33  These are irreparable harms to the organizational plaintiffs’ \nmembers. \nFinally, plaintiff Pastor Eva Steege has already suffered irreparable harm:  she died on \nMarch 15 without resolving her student loans.  See Suggestion of Death [Dkt. # 83]; Steege Decl. \n¶ 9 (“If I do not receive public service loan forgiveness and the large refund that I am owed before \nmy death, my family could be forced to pursue a death discharge that will not provide them with \nthe refund that they are counting on so that they can use the money for basic needs after I pass.”).  \nThe defense argument that Steege faces no irreparable harm “from allegedly not being able to \nimmediately meet with CFPB staff,” Defs.’ Opp. at 38, ignored both her terminal illness and her \nstatement  that she  had  “attempted to submit the necessary  forms and  provide the required \ndocumentation multiple times but . . . encountered issues with miscommunication, conflicting \n \n33   See, e.g., Commc’ns. Workers of Am. District 1, AFL–CIO v. NYNEX Corp., 898 F.2d 887, \n891 (2d Cir. 1990) (the threat of termination of medical benefits to striking workers constitutes \nirreparable harm); Whelan v. Colgan, 602 F.2d 1060, 1062 (2d Cir. 1979) (“[T]he threatened \ntermination of benefits such as medical coverage for workers and their families obviously raised \nthe specter of irreparable injury.”). \n105 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 106 of 112\nguidance, delays, and errors in processing.”  Steege Decl. ¶ 2.34  It also ignored that “all prior \nOmbudsmen serving during the Obama, Trump, and Biden Administrations dealt with federal \nstudent loan issues regularly.”  Barnard Decl. ¶ 5.  The irreparable harm that has already come to \npass for Pastor Eva Steege is enough to grant preliminary relief.  See Obergefell v. Kasich, No. \n13-CV-501, 2013 WL 3814262, at *7 (S.D. Ohio July 22, 2013) (“Dying with an incorrect death \ncertificate that prohibits Mr. Arthur from being buried with dignity constitutes irreparable harm. \n. . . A later decision allowing an amendment to the death certificate cannot remediate the harm to \nMr. Arthur, as he will have passed away.”).   \nC.  The balance of the equities and the public interest weigh in favor of \npreliminary relief. \nThe remaining two requirements to be assessed before the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction are whether the balance of equities tilts in the plaintiffs’ favor and whether the \ninjunction would be in the public interest.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  Generally, when one party \nis the government, these factors tend to merge and are considered together.  Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 435 (2009).  \nDefendants devote less than a page to this issue in their brief, and they have only identified \none public interest that is at stake:  the public’s interest in the democratically-elected President’s \nprerogative to pursue his policy objectives.  See Opp. at 39–40 (“The public has an interest in \npermitting the President to take decisive action when it comes to setting his policy priorities for \nthe CFPB.”), citing Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831–32 (1985).  See also May 3 Tr. at 111 \n \n34   The Court also notes that half of the staff of the Department of Education have recently \nbeen  terminated,  which  undermines  defendants’  argument.    See  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Ed.  Press \nRelease, (Mar.  11,  2025)  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-\neducation-initiates-reduction-force. \n106 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 107 of 112\n– 114.35  This is a significant interest in connection with any executive agency, and if the Court \nwere being asked to enjoin a decision on how vigorously the CFPB will enforce particular \nprovisions within the statute, or concerning whether agency resources should be allocated to \nfacilitate more robust supervision of non-traditional, non-depository lenders, as opposed to more \nactive monitoring of larger, depository banking institutions, it would bear heavily on the analysis.   \nBut this case is not about how the executive exercises his discretion, and the defendants’ \ncitation of Heckler is misplaced. What happened in February was not merely a realignment of \npriorities. The Court has found after an evidentiary hearing and the review of an extensive record, \nthat the plaintiffs are likely to establish that the defendants stopped all work, and that they took, \nand plan to take, additional concrete steps to dismantle and shut down the agency entirely, in \nviolation of statutory mandates.  Plaintiffs are likely to prove that even if some statutorily required \nwork resumed when the stop work order was relaxed, defendants have already made a decision to \nabandon their statutory obligations to the many members of the public who are consumers.  And \nit  is  likely  to  be  shown  that  in  doing  so,  the  defendants  overstepped  their  statutory  and \nconstitutional  authority  and  usurped  the  power  of  the  members  of  Congress,  who  were \ndemocratically elected by the people in every state in the union.   Finally, the Court has also found \nthat defendants are poised to complete that process if the motion for an injunction is denied, and \n \n35   While  this  was  the  only  governmental  or  public  interest  identified,  defense  counsel \ndeclined to provide any further information as to what the administration’s policy with respect to \nthe CFPB might be, maintaining that whether there is a public interest in ensuring that the agency \ncarries out its statutory duties to help people goes to the merits, not the public interest factor.  \nMar. 3 Tr. at 111–14.   \n107 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 108 of 112\nthat the closure of the agency will be swift, complete, and irreversible.  In those extraordinary \ncircumstances, an injunction advances the public interest.36  \nIt is notable that when the Supreme Court found the Dodd-Frank Act’s restrictions on the \nremoval of the Director to be unconstitutional, it insisted that those provisions were severable from \nthe rest of the statute, in part because eliminating the agency and sending its functions back to \nwhence they came would be entirely unworkable. \nPetitioner  assumes  that,  if  we  eliminate  the  CFPB,  regulatory  and \nenforcement authority over the statutes it administers would simply revert \nback to the handful of independent agencies previously responsible for \nthem.  But, as the Solicitor General and House of Representatives explain, \nthat shift would trigger a major regulatory disruption and would leave \nappreciable  damage  to  Congress’s  work  in  the  consumer-finance \narena.  One of the agencies whose regulatory authority was transferred to \nthe CFPB no longer exists . . . (Office of Thrift Supervision).  The others do \nnot have the staff or appropriations to absorb the CFPB’s 1,500-employee, \n500-million-dollar operations.  And none has the authority to administer the \nDodd-Frank Act’s new prohibition on unfair and deceptive practices in the \nconsumer-finance sector.  \n \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 236–37 (citations omitted).  \n   The amicus briefs filed by public officials and governmental entities include information \nthat bears on the balance of the equities and the public interest in an injunction.  While defense \ncounsel declined to weigh in on the public interest in the agency’s mission, the amici did.  Like \n \n36    While this case pits private parties against a governmental entity, it is relevant to the public \ninterest and balance of the equities analysis that it is likely that the challenged action exceeded the \nexecutive’s authority under the Constitution. See Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. Fed. Election \nComm’n, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016), quoting Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. \nCir. 2013) (“[E]nforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public interest.”). \nSee also Centro Tepeyac v. Montgomery Cnty, 722 F.3d 184 (4th Cir. 2013).  While that case arose \nin a different context, that is, a state’s alleged violation of the First Amendment, the court cited \n“precedent that counsels that ‘a state is in no way harmed by issuance of a preliminary injunction \nwhich prevents the state from enforcing restrictions likely to be found unconstitutional.  If \nanything, the system is improved by such an injunction.’ . . . It also teaches that ‘upholding \nconstitutional rights surely serves the public interest.’”  Id. at 191, quoting Giovani Carandola, \nLtd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. 2002). \n108 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 109 of 112\nthe Supreme Court, they highlight the singular role played by the CFPB and the costly vacuum \nthat would be created by its absence.   \nThe Court received a brief from 203 Members of Congress, a group that includes “members \nwho sponsored Dodd-Frank, participated in drafting it, serve or served on committees with \njurisdiction over the federal financial regulatory agencies and the banking industry, and currently \nserve in the leadership or served in the leadership when Dodd-Frank was passed.”  Members’ Br. \nat 1 .  Based on that experience: \nThey are thus familiar with the essential role that the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau (CFPB or the Bureau) plays in Dodd-Frank’s framework. \nSignificantly, based on their experiences, amici know that Congress created \nthe CFPB as a new agency with consolidated consumer financial protection \nauthority and gave the Bureau extensive—and in many cases exclusive—\nmandatory responsibilities and obligations to regulate the very financial \ninstitutions whose conduct led to the 2008 financial crisis. \n \nId.   They warn the Court: \nDefendants’  stop-work  order  will  have  severe  consequences  for  the \nAmerican people. The CFPB has been a resounding success. It has delivered \nmore than $21 billion back to consumers who have been defrauded by \nentities like large banks, loan servicers, debt collectors, and payday lenders, \nsome of which were previously not subject to federal supervision. Among \nthe many ways the CFPB has protected consumers, it has confronted the \nunlawful practices of some of the country’s largest financial institutions in \nlawsuits  and  enforcement  actions,  provided  certainty  and  guidance  to \nfinancial  institutions  of  all  sizes,  enforced  protections  against \ndiscrimination  in  consumer  financial  markets,  and  halted  predatory \ntargeting of servicemembers and their families. \n \n*  *  * \nIf Defendants are successful in their attacks on the CFPB, they will have \ndestroyed the framework Congress created for safeguarding the finances of \nmillions of consumers. As a result, entire swaths of the market will go \nunprotected from the type of predatory conduct that caused the 2008 crisis \nbecause no other federal or state agency has the necessary authority to fill \nmany of the regulatory gaps the Bureau’s absence would leave. \n \n109 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 110 of 112\nMembers’ Br. at 3 and 4.  See also id. at 13 (“A sudden halt to the CFPB’s important—and \nmandatory—work would also be devastating for consumers, small businesses, and the country’s \noverall financial stability. . . . [S]upervision would cease, leaving many financial institutions \nunmonitored and unchecked; and enforcement of many consumer financial protection laws would \nbe limited, leaving millions of consumers with little recourse for the money they lose to unlawful \nfinancial practices.).   \nThe Members of Congress also emphasize the importance of the statutorily mandated \noffices that support service members and seniors who are particularly vulnerable to predatory \npractices.  Id. at 6, 18.  They also emphasize the key role the agency plays in helping to manage \nand reduce managing lenders’ legal risks, so that consumers can continue to have the access to the \ncredit they need for such things as mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans.  Id. at 16.  \nThe brief filed by the twenty-two states and the District of Columbia warns of a distinct \nharm to the public interest given the particular role that states play in our federal system.  They \nmake it clear that they cannot fulfill the enormous role of monitoring lenders and responding to \nconsumer complaints on their own.  \nThe loss of CFPB’s partnership has concrete and far-reaching implications:  \nfrom collaborating on supervisory examinations, to sharing of complaints \nand trend data, to providing training, to partnering on joint investigations \nand litigations, the CFPB has been a force multiplier for States’ consumer-\nprotection efforts. Absent a preliminary injunction to prevent the sudden \nloss of these significant contributions, the States will be unexpectedly \nstretched.  \n \nStates’ Br. at 12.  \nWhile the CFPB has supervisory authority over approximately 200 of the \nlargest financial institutions in the country, it shares supervisory authority \nwith States and augments States’ own supervisory efforts in a number of \nimportant ways. First, States rely on the CFPB to supervise compliance with \nfederal consumer-protection laws by very large national banks, over which \nthe CFPB has “exclusive authority,” 12 U.S.C. § 5515(b)(1). Information \n110 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 111 of 112\ngleaned from this supervision is regularly shared with the States and can \ninform States’ decisions on how to supervise and identify risk within the \nfinancial institutions under their direct supervision. Second, the CFPB and \nStates  each  have  supervisory  authority  over  the  largest  state-chartered \nbanks,  nonbank  entities  offering  consumer  financial  products  such  as \nnonbank mortgage lenders and payday lenders, and emerging markets such \nas digital payments. Because many States’ decisions about how best to \nallocate resources have relied on the CFPB’s role in these areas, the CFPB’s \nsudden absence will create gaps in supervision that will be difficult to fill at \nall, let alone promptly. The resulting vacuum will uniquely burden States. \nId. at 13.   \nThe states explain that there would be no substitute for the CFPB’s statutorily mandated \nconsumer complaint system and its intake process that identifies and prioritizes complaints \ninvolving imminent foreclosures, referring them to local counselors who can assist with timely \nresolution.  Id. at 7–8.  They also emphasize that the CFPB is the only federal regulator with \nsupervisory authority over nonbank mortgage lenders.  Id. at 7.  These observations all point to the \nneed to preserve the status quo while the case is decided. \nFinally, when weighing this factor, the Court finds that a preliminary injunction that leaves \nthe agency standing during the pendency of this case will not harm the only public interest \nidentified by the defendants:  the public interest in the President’s exercise of his Article II powers \nto accomplish his policy objectives.  See Defs.’ Opp. at 38–40.  That is because Article II explicitly \nrequires him to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.  If the \nPresident finds the Consumer Financial Protection Act to be unsatisfactory, the administration will \nremain completely free to advance his agenda by proposing legislation that reconfigures the agency \nin a manner that is consistent with his policy preferences.   It will then be up to Congress to weigh \nthe advantages of any specific proposal aimed at streamlining the agency against the benefits of \nsustaining the CFPB, which has been fulfilling its mission to return billions of dollars to consumers \nat no cost to the taxpayers since 2010. \n111 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 87     Filed 03/28/25     Page 112 of 112\nCONCLUSION \nIn sum, the Court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled \ncompletely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion.  For \nall of the reasons set forth above, the Court will GRANT [Dkt. # 10] plaintiffs’ motion and issue \na preliminary injunction that maintains the agency’s existence until this case has been resolved on \nthe merits, reinstating and preserving the agency’s contracts, work force, data, and operational \ncapacity, and protecting and facilitating the employees’ ability to perform statutorily required \nactivities.  The Court is aware of the modifications the plaintiffs have made to their proposed order, \nas well as the objections lodged by the defendants to previous iterations of the proposed order, and \nit is mindful that its order must be sufficiently specific to be enforceable, while also broad enough \nto afford the agency and its leadership the discretion they are accorded under the statute when \ncarrying out their regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory responsibilities. \n  A separate order will issue.   \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  March 28, 2025 \n112 \n ",

See Mem. \nOp. [Dkt. # 87].  Based on its findings that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, they \nare likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the balance of equities \ntips in their favor, and an injunction serves the public interest, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion \nfor preliminary injunction and issued an order designed to preserve the status quo.  The Court \nstated, “[i]f the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has \nthe opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants’ own witness \nwarned, the harm will be irreparable.”  Mem. Op. at 3. \nAmong other things, the injunction required that: \n1.  Defendants shall maintain and . . . not delete, destroy, remove, or impair \nany data or  other CFPB records  covered by the Federal Records Act \n(hereafter  ‘agency  data’)  except  in  accordance  with  the  procedures \ndescribed in 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33;  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 113     Filed 04/18/25     Page 2 of 7\n2.  Defendants shall reinstate all probationary and term employees terminated \nbetween February 10, 2025 and the date of this order, including but not \nlimited to . . . the Private Student Loan Ombudsman; \n3.  Defendants shall not terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause \nrelated  to  the  individual  employee’s  performance  or  conduct,  and \ndefendants shall not issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB \nemployee; \n4.  Defendants shall not enforce the February 10, 2025 stop-work order or \nrequire employees to take administrative leave in furtherance of that order, \nand defendants shall not reinstitute or seek to achieve the outcome of a work \nstoppage, whether through a stop-work order, an order directing employees \nto take administrative leave, or any other means; and . . .  \n6.  Defendants shall ensure that in accordance with 12 U.S.C. § 5492(b)(3), the \nCFPB Office of Consumer Response continues to maintain a single, toll-\nfree  telephone  number,  a  website,  and  a  database  for  the  centralized \ncollection of consumer complaints regarding consumer financial products \nand  services,  and  that  it  continues  to  monitor  and  respond  to  those \ncomplaints, including by providing Elevated Case Management.  \nPrelim. Inj. [Dkt. # 88] at 1–2.   \n  On April 1, defendants moved to stay the Order pending appeal, Mot. to Stay [Dkt. # 97], \nwhich the Court granted in part and denied in part on April 3.  Order [Dkt. # 102].  It reiterated \nthat in issuing the preliminary injunction, “after a detailed analysis of the testimony and agency \nrecords introduced by both sides, it found that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims, including the claim that the defendants are in fact engaged in an effort to shut down the \nagency in violation of law notwithstanding their denials.”  Id. at 2.  Given its prior findings, the \nCourt was skeptical of the defendants’ assurances that they would carry out the agency’s statutory \nmission, and it found that a stay would substantially injure the plaintiffs and would be contrary to \nthe public interest.  “The defendants would be free to move swiftly to take the steps that would \neliminate the agency . . . which the Court already found they are poised to do.”  Id. at 5.  However, \nwith the plaintiffs’ consent, it stayed the provision in paragraph 8 of the Order that required the \nagency to report on its compliance with the injunction by April 4.  Id. at 1.   \n  In the meantime, defendants had filed a substantially similar emergency motion with the \nD.C. Circuit seeking a stay pending appeal.  NTEU v. Vought, Case No. 25-5091 (D.C. Cir.), \nEmergency Mot. for an Admin. Stay and Stay Pending Appeal and Supp. Mem. [Dkt. # 210841] \n(“Defs.’ Mot.”).  In a short per curiam order issued on the evening of Friday, April 11, the Court \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 113     Filed 04/18/25     Page 3 of 7\nof Appeals granted the motion in part and denied it in part.  See id., Order [Dkt. # 2110720] (“Cir. \nOrder”).  After considering the defendants’ representations that the Bureau would continue to \nperform its mandatory statutory duties, see e.g., Defs.’ Mot. at 1, 2, & 3, and that it was engaged \nin nothing more than a typical reevaluation of policy priorities at the start of a new administration \nrather than the wholesale elimination of an agency, see id. at 6, it ordered:   \nProvision two (2) is stayed insofar as it requires defendants to reinstate \nemployees  whom  defendants  have  determined,  after  an  individualized \nassessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants' statutory \nduties. \nProvision  three  (3)  is  stayed  insofar  as  it  prohibits  defendants  from \nterminating or issuing a notice of reduction in force to employees whom \ndefendants  have  determined,  after  a  particularized  assessment,  to  be \nunnecessary to the performance of defendants’ statutory duties.   \nThe court understands provision four (4) to allow work stoppages that \ndefendants have determined, after a particularized assessment, would not \ninterfere with the performance of defendants' statutory duties. On that \nunderstanding, provision four (4) remains in effect.   \nCir. Order at 1–2.  The Court also stayed provision eight (8), which had been stayed by this Court \nas well, and it set a schedule for the briefing of defendants’ appeal of the preliminary injunction  \nwith a hearing more than a month away.  Id. at 2.  It then announced: \nAll other provisions of the preliminary injunction remain in full effect \npending further order of the court. \nId. \n  That was on Friday evening.  And within three to four business days, the agency took the \nfeared swift and decisive action to RIF more than eighty percent of its workforce:  to terminate \nmore than 1400 of its employees, even more than the total who were on the chopping block on \nFebruary 14.   \n  At 6:02 p.m. on Thursday April 17, 2025, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for an order \nto show cause as to why defendants had not violated the preliminary injunction.  Mot. for Order to \nShow Cause [Dkt. # 105].  The motion stated that earlier that day, defendants sent reduction-in-\nforce notices to the vast majority of CFPB employees and that all affected employees would be \nentirely cut off from computer access at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, April 18, 2025.  Id. at 1.  The Court \nscheduled a hearing for Friday at 11:00 a.m., and it called for the production of certain materials.  \nSee Minute Order (Apr. 17, 2025). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 113     Filed 04/18/25     Page 4 of 7\n  In response to the Court’s order, defendants filed a list of the 1408 employees subject to \nthe RIF.  Notice of Sealed Filing [Dkt. # 108]. They also supplied the Court with a copy of the \nmemorandum sent to CFPB employees from Mark R. Paoletta, Chief Legal Officer of the CFPB, \nentitled “2025 Supervision and Enforcement Priorities,” on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, and a \nrepresentative memorandum from defendant Russell Vought to an employee concerning “Specific \nNotice of Reduction in Force,” that was dated April 17, 2025.  Attachments to Paoletta Decl. [Dkt. \n# 109].  Defendants also filed a declaration from Paoletta averring that along with two unnamed \nCFPB attorneys, on some unspecified date, he “conducted a particularized assessment to determine \nwhich employees are unnecessary for the Bureau to perform its statutory duties.”  Paoletta Decl. \n[Dkt. # 109] at 2.  The declaration does not describe any consultation with the heads of the various \noffices involved.  \n  On April 18, plaintiffs filed six declarations of their own, which paint a dramatically \ndifferent picture.  See Notice of Decls. [Dkt. # 106]; Decl. of Jason Brown, [Dkt. # 110]; Decl. of \nJosh Friedman [Dkt. # 110-1]; 2d Decl. of Alex Doe [Dkt. # 111].  Matthew Pfaff, Chief of Staff \nfor the Office of Consumer Response, states that no managers in Consumer Response were \nconsulted by agency leadership about the level of staff needed to perform the office’s statutory \nduties (which are now explicitly incorporated in the Order) or how the RIF would affect its ability \nto respond to the thousands of consumer complaints and inquiries from banks that it receives.  3d \nDecl. of Matthew Pfaff [Dkt. # 106-1] ¶¶ 3, 7.  The RIF will reduce the statutorily mandated Office \nfrom approximately 135 employees to eight, none of whom are the ones who carry out the day-to-\nday tasks involved in fulfilling its obligations.  Id. ¶ 5.   \nJason Brown, the head of the statutorily mandated Office of Research, states that only he \nand two other senior leaders will remain after the RIF, and that none of them were consulted about \nhow these terminations would impact the office’s ability to fulfill its statutory duties.  See Decl. of \nJason Brown [Dkt. # 110] ¶¶ 3–4.  Josh Friedman, an Air Force veteran and employee of the \nBureau’s Office of Servicemember Affairs, another office called for by Congress, states that he \nand all or nearly all employees of that office “ha[ve] been RIFd” and that the office “will not be \nable to perform its statutory duties” without adequate, experienced staff.  Decl. of Josh Friedman \n[Dkt. # 110-1] ¶¶ 3, 5.   \nFinally, Alex Doe, who was formerly on the Bureau’s RIF team until she testified before \nthis Court, was advised by other team members that this RIF is even larger than the one that had \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 113     Filed 04/18/25     Page 5 of 7\nbeen planned for February 14, and that someone named Gavin Kliger of DOGE managed the RIF \nin lengthy, contentious meetings with the team this week.  2d Decl. of Alex Doe ¶¶ 3, 5–6.  She \nstated that “[t]eam members raised the concern with Adam Martinez [the CFPB Chief Operating \nOfficer who oversees the Office of Human Capital] that there was a court order requiring that they \ndo a particularized assessment, but they were told all that mattered was the numbers. The direction \nto ignore the concern came from Mark Paoletta, who said the numbers-based RIF should move \nforward, and that leadership would assume the risk.”  Id. ¶ 7. \n  The Court held a hearing this morning at which plaintiffs made an oral motion that the \nCourt enforce its Order, and the motion for an order to show cause was deemed to be a motion to \nenforce.  Counsel for the defendants professed to have little knowledge of what had transpired at \nthe agency or who was involved.  It became clear to the Court that given the starkly different \npictures being presented by declarations alone, it is necessary to conduct an evidentiary hearing \nbefore the Court can determine whether the agency is complying with or flouting the Order.  Both \nparties asked for time to be able to prepare, and a schedule was established with the consent of \nboth sides:  plaintiffs may issue requests for production of documents to defendants by Friday, \nApril 18; defendants’ response to the motion to enforce is due by Tuesday, April 22; plaintiffs’ \nreply is due by Thursday, April 24; and a hearing is set for Monday, April 9:30 a.m.1 \nIt also became clear that it is incumbent upon the Court once again to preserve the status \nquo in the meantime, and the Court ruled on the record that the announced RIF of the 1408 \nemployees listed in Dkt. 108 may NOT be implemented or effectuated, and that employees’ access \nto work systems, including email and internal platforms, may NOT be discontinued at 6:00 pm \ntoday.  The defense voiced no objection to this directive. \nGiven the scope and speed of the agency’s action, the apparent lack of consultation with \nthe heads of the statutorily mandated agency components involved, and the troubling description \nof the RIF meetings set forth in plaintiffs’ declarations, the Court has significant grounds for \nconcern that the defendants are not in compliance with its Order as it was refined by the Court of \nAppeals.  While the Chief Legal Counsel has intoned the phrase “particularized assessment,” there \nis reason to believe that the defendants simply spent the days immediately following the Circuit’s \n \n1    The Court proposed to hold the hearing on Wednesday, April 23, but both parties asked for \nmore time. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 113     Filed 04/18/25     Page 6 of 7\nrelaxation of the Order dressing their RIF in new clothes, and that they are thumbing their nose at \nboth this Court and the Court of Appeals.   \nThe material submitted to date provides cause to believe that a RIF that will decimate the \nagency and render it unable to comply with its statutory duties is underway, and that it will be \ncompleted before this Court can determine whether it comports with the Order of March 27, as \nstayed in part by the Circuit’s Order of April 11. Under those circumstances, the Court must act, \nand it has the power to act. \n“It is well established that the District Court is without jurisdiction to alter a judgment of \nits own while an appeal therefrom is ongoing.  But it is equally clear that the vitality of that \njudgment is undiminished by pendency of the appeal.  Unless a stay is granted either by the court \nrendering the judgment or by the court to which the appeal is taken, the judgment remains \noperative.  To be sure, for as long as the appellate court retains its mandate it maintains its \njurisdiction over the case, and thus the power to alter the mandate.  But non-issuance of the \nmandate by the appellate court has no impact on the trial court’s powers to enforce its unstayed \njudgment since the latter court has retained that power throughout the pendency of the appeal.” \nDeering Milliken, Inc. v. FTC, 647 F.2d 1124, 1128–29 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (footnotes omitted).  See \nManess v. Myers, 419 U.S. 449, 458–59 (1975) (“[It is a] basic proposition that all orders and \njudgments  of  courts  must  be  complied  with  promptly. . . .  The  orderly  and  expeditious \nadministration of justice by the courts requires that an order issued by a court with jurisdiction \nover the subject matter must be obeyed by the parties until it is reversed by orderly and proper \nproceedings.”). \nOnce again, the Court is confronted with evidence that gives rise to concerns that there will \nbe no agency standing by the time it gets to consider the merits, by the time the Court of Appeals \nrules on the legality of the preliminary injunction, or even by the time it holds a hearing on the \nmotion to enforce the Order.  As the D.C. Circuit has recently reiterated, Rule 65 authorizes a \ndistrict court to issue interim relief to prevent irreparable injury and to preserve the status quo \nwhile  the  district  court  assesses  the  merits  of  a  case.    Dellinger  v.  Bessent,  No.  25-5028, \n2025 WL 559669, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025), citing Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 301, 314 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (“The usual role of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending \nthe outcome of litigation.”) (cleaned up).  A district court “ha[s] authority, from the necessity of \nthe case, to make orders to preserve the existing conditions and the subject of the petition” until it \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 113     Filed 04/18/25     Page 7 of 7\ncan determine how to proceed, as “the law contemplates the possibility of a decision either way, \nand therefore must provide for it.”  Id. at *3, quoting United States v. Shipp, 203 U.S. 563, 573 \n(1906).  Those principles surely apply when the Court is faced with what appears to be a violation \nof a preliminary injunction that has already been reviewed and refined by the Court of Appeals \nand that remains in force, and the Court finds it necessary to enjoin the planned RIF to preserve \nthe existing conditions and the subject of plaintiffs’ motion until it can determine how to proceed. \nTherefore, as stated on the record at today’s hearing, the defendants are ordered as follows:   \n1)   the Reduction in Force announced by Acting Director Vought on or \nabout April 17, 2025 is SUSPENDED and it may NOT be implemented, \neffectuated, or completed in any way until this Court has ruled on \nplaintiffs’ motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, and  \n2)  the defendants are PROHIBITED from discontinuing any employee’s \naccess to work systems, including email and internal platforms until \nthis Court has ruled on plaintiffs’ motion. \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  April 18, 2025 \n7 \n ",

Vought, in his official capacity as\nActing Director of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau,\nAppellants\n------------------------------\nConsolidated with 25-5132\nBEFORE: Pillard, Katsas, and Rao*, Circuit Judges\nO R D E R\nUpon consideration of the emergency motion to enforce or clarify the court’s April\n11, 2025 order, the response thereto, and the reply, it is\nORDERED that the emergency motion be granted in part.  Defendants seek\nclarification of what constitutes a “particularized assessment” that employees subject to\na proposed reduction in force (RIF) are unnecessary to the performance of defendants’\nstatutory duties, as that term is used in this court’s April 11, 2025 order partially granting\ndefendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal.  That term was not clearly defined in our\nstay order, so we define it now.  Such a “particularized assessment” involves a\ndetermination, conducted by the decisionmaker responsible for the RIF, that each\ndivision or office within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be able to\nperform any statutorily required duties of that division or office without the employees\nsubject to the RIF.  The declaration filed by the CFPB’s Chief Legal Officer on April 18,\n2025 states that the defendants conducted the requisite “particularized assessment.”  It\nis\n* A statement by Circuit Judge Rao, dissenting from this order, is attached.\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5091 September Term, 2024\nFURTHER ORDERED, sua sponte, that this court’s stay order be modified in\npart to lift the partial stay of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction.  Our partial stay\norder permitted defendants to conduct RIFs of employees “whom defendants have\ndetermined, after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of\ndefendants’ statutory duties.”  The parties vigorously dispute whether this language\npermits judicial review of the questions whether the assessment at issue was\n“particularized” and whether the employees subject to the RIF are “unnecessary to the\nperformance of defendants’ statutory duties.”  Defendants further argue that any such\njudicial review would make the injunction impermissibly vague.  In response, plaintiffs\nhighlight that the proposed RIF currently at issue, involving nearly 90 percent of agency\nemployees, exceeds the scope of the RIF that prompted the district court’s original\npreliminary injunction.  Given these ongoing disputes, we think it best to restore the\ninterim protection of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction, which ensures that\nplaintiffs can receive meaningful final relief should the defendants not prevail in this\nappeal, rather than continue collateral litigation over the meaning and reviewability of\nthe “particularized assessment” requirement imposed by this court’s stay order. \nReinforcing this conclusion, we have already accommodated the government’s interests\nby substantially expediting the appeal, with oral argument scheduled less than three\nweeks from today.  At that time, we will carefully consider the separation-of-powers and\nother arguments raised by the parties.  For these reasons, paragraph (3) of the\npreliminary injunction under review is now effective pending further order of this court.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nMichael C. McGrail\nDeputy Clerk\nPage 2\n\nRAO, Circuit Judge, dissenting: The panel today bars the \npolitical  leadership  of  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection \nBureau (CFPB) from reducing its workforce in accordance \nwith President Trump’s directives. Because the preliminary \ninjunction entered by the district court raises serious separation \nof powers concerns and has paved the way for ongoing judicial \nsupervision of an Executive Branch agency, I would continue \nthe stay pending appeal. \n* * *\nAt  the  end  of  March,  the  district  court  entered  a \npreliminary injunction prohibiting the CFPB from carrying out \nany reductions in force (RIFs), effectively freezing the staffing \nof the CFPB as it existed under the previous administration. \nThe government sought a stay of the injunction pending appeal, \nwhich we granted in substantial part on April 11. The stay \npermitted  RIFs  consistent  with  the  CFPB’s  statutory \nobligations. We also expedited consideration of the merits of \nthe preliminary injunction and scheduled oral argument for \nMay 16.  \nThe enjoined parties include the Acting Director and other \npolitical leadership of the CFPB, appointed by the President to \nimplement his agenda. With the preliminary injunction largely \nstayed, the CFPB’s leadership issued RIF notices to more than \n80 percent of the agency’s workforce. In a statement filed \nbelow,  the  agency’s  Chief  Legal  Officer  detailed  the \nparticularized assessment underlying the RIF and attested that \nthe  “employees  retained  were  sufficient  to  perform  the \nBureau’s  statutory  duties.”  Declaration  of  Mark  Paoletta, \nNTEU v. CFPB, 25-cv-381, ECF 109, at 4 (D.D.C. Apr. 18, \n2025). He further clarified that the employees subject to the \nRIF  would  remain  employed  for  sixty  days,  and  that  the \nagency’s leadership would “continuously assess the Bureau’s \nworkforce needs” and “make appropriate changes to ensure \ncompliance with statutory duties.” Id.  \n\n2 \nRather than wait to  see if any harm materialized, the \nplaintiffs returned to the district court on the same day the RIF \nnotices  were  issued,  demanding  immediate  judicial \nintervention because it was “unfathomable” that the CFPB \ncould continue to provide statutorily required services if the \nRIF were executed. But the plaintiffs did not allege they had \nsuffered any specific harm or loss of service from the RIF. Nor \ncould they, since the employees subject to the RIF had not yet \nstopped working, much less been terminated. \nWithout any finding of particularized harm, the district \ncourt halted the RIF. Although the district court styled its \naction  as  a  temporary  restraining  order,  “the  label \nattached ... by the trial court is not decisive.” Adams v. Vance, \n570 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (cleaned up); see also Dep’t \nof Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025). I would \nconstrue the district court’s order prohibiting the RIF as a \nmodification  of  its  preliminary  injunction.  See  Dunlap  v. \nPresidential Advisory Comm’n on Election Integrity, 944 F.3d \n945,  948  (D.C.  Cir.  2019)  (“An  order  modifies  an  earlier \ninjunction when it actually changes the legal relationship of the \nparties to the decree.”) (cleaned up). As such, the order is \nimmediately appealable. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). If the district \ncourt abused its discretion in modifying the injunction, vacatur \nis the appropriate remedy. Klayman v. Porter, 104 F.4th 298, \n305 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \n* * * \nIn  my  view,  the  district  court’s  modification  of  the \ninjunction is inconsistent with the terms of this court’s April 11 \nstay and therefore an abuse of discretion.  \nThe April 11 stay did not create a preclearance regime \nwhereby  the  CFPB  must  obtain  judicial  approval  for  its \nmanagement decisions. Unfortunately, that is precisely what is \n \n\n3 \nunfolding below, as the district court has blocked a RIF while \nit determines, by its own lights, whether the CFPB’s staffing \nplans will be sufficient to fulfill general statutory requirements. \nSee NTEU v. CFPB, 25-cv-381, ECF 113, at 5–6 (D.D.C. Apr. \n18, 2025) (enjoining RIF and scheduling evidentiary hearing to \ndetermine whether planned staffing levels will leave agency \n“unable to comply with its statutory duties”); id., Minute Order \n(D.D.C.  Apr.  21,  2025)  (requiring  Chief  Legal  Officer  to \nappear  at  hearing  and  be  available  to  testify  about  his \nparticularized assessment).  \nThe  district  court’s  approach  turns  the  separation  of \npowers on its head. The execution of the laws, including the \nmanagement  of  administrative  agencies,  is  committed  to \nExecutive Branch officials under the direction of the President. \nSee U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3 (requiring the President to “take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed”). When agency \naction is challenged, courts have an essential obligation to say \nwhat the law is. But whatever the merits of this underlying \nlawsuit, the district court cannot erase the boundaries between \nthe courts and the Executive by setting up a temporary judicial \nreceivership  of  the  CFPB.  As  the  Supreme  Court  has \nadmonished, “it is not the role of courts, but that of the political \nbranches,  to  shape  the  institutions  of  government  in  such \nfashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.” Lewis \nv. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996); see also Dan Dobbs, Law \nof Remedies § 2.9(5) (2d ed. 1993) (“[J]udicial  control of \nlegislative  or  executive  branch  decisions  interferes \nsubstantially  with  the  separation  of  powers  system  of \ngovernment. If the judicial interference is substantial, judges \nthemselves may lose their distinctive judicial character if they \nbecome  managers  of  executive  departments  by  way  of \ninjunction.”).  \n \n\n4 \nWhile the April 11 stay left some parts of the preliminary \ninjunction in place based on the government’s concessions, it \nin no way authorized the district court to “inject[] [itself] into \nday-to-day  agency  management”  or  to  superintend  the \npersonnel decisions of the CFPB’s political leadership. Norton \nv. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 67 (2004). I would \nvacate the district court’s modification. \nTo the extent the stay was unclear, I would clarify that if \nthe  defendants’  actions  cause  a  plaintiff  to  lose  services \nrequired by statute, the district court may issue appropriate \nrelief, targeted to that plaintiff’s specific injury, under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62(d). See Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. \nv.  Sw.  Marine  Inc.,  242  F.3d  1163,  1166  (9th  Cir.  2001) \n(explaining that “any action taken pursuant to Rule 62[(d)] may \nnot materially alter the status of the case on appeal”) (cleaned \nup); Casey, 518 U.S. at 357 (“The remedy must of course be \nlimited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that \nthe plaintiff has established.”). In the alternative, if a partial \nstay is truly “unworkable,” I would put an end to these cat-and-\nmouse games and stay the preliminary injunction  entirely. \nTrump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 585 \n(2017) (Thomas, J., concurring in part). \n* * * \nThe  district  court  overstepped  our  stay.  Rather  than \nremedy  the  judicial  error,  today’s  order  hamstrings  the \nExecutive and prevents the CFPB from downsizing until the \nmerits  of  the  appeal  are  resolved.  The  lack  of  judicially \nmanageable  standards  in  this  posture  is  a  reason  to  leave \nexecution  of  the  laws  to  the  Executive,  not  the  courts.  I \nrespectfully dissent. \n ",

Vought, in his official capacity as\nActing Director of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau,\nAppellants\n------------------------------\nConsolidated with 25-5132\nBEFORE: Pillard, Katsas, and Rao*, Circuit Judges\nO R D E R\nUpon consideration of the emergency motion to enforce or clarify the court’s April\n11, 2025 order, the response thereto, and the reply, it is\nORDERED that the emergency motion be granted in part.  Defendants seek\nclarification of what constitutes a “particularized assessment” that employees subject to\na proposed reduction in force (RIF) are unnecessary to the performance of defendants’\nstatutory duties, as that term is used in this court’s April 11, 2025 order partially granting\ndefendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal.  That term was not clearly defined in our\nstay order, so we define it now.  Such a “particularized assessment” involves a\ndetermination, conducted by the decisionmaker responsible for the RIF, that each\ndivision or office within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be able to\nperform any statutorily required duties of that division or office without the employees\nsubject to the RIF.  The declaration filed by the CFPB’s Chief Legal Officer on April 18,\n2025 states that the defendants conducted the requisite “particularized assessment.”  It\nis\n* A statement by Circuit Judge Rao, dissenting from this order, is attached.\n\nUSCA Case #25-5132      Document #2113309            Filed: 04/28/2025      Page 2 of 6\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5091 September Term, 2024\nFURTHER ORDERED, sua sponte, that this court’s stay order be modified in\npart to lift the partial stay of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction.  Our partial stay\norder permitted defendants to conduct RIFs of employees “whom defendants have\ndetermined, after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of\ndefendants’ statutory duties.”  The parties vigorously dispute whether this language\npermits judicial review of the questions whether the assessment at issue was\n“particularized” and whether the employees subject to the RIF are “unnecessary to the\nperformance of defendants’ statutory duties.”  Defendants further argue that any such\njudicial review would make the injunction impermissibly vague.  In response, plaintiffs\nhighlight that the proposed RIF currently at issue, involving nearly 90 percent of agency\nemployees, exceeds the scope of the RIF that prompted the district court’s original\npreliminary injunction.  Given these ongoing disputes, we think it best to restore the\ninterim protection of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction, which ensures that\nplaintiffs can receive meaningful final relief should the defendants not prevail in this\nappeal, rather than continue collateral litigation over the meaning and reviewability of\nthe “particularized assessment” requirement imposed by this court’s stay order. \nReinforcing this conclusion, we have already accommodated the government’s interests\nby substantially expediting the appeal, with oral argument scheduled less than three\nweeks from today.  At that time, we will carefully consider the separation-of-powers and\nother arguments raised by the parties.  For these reasons, paragraph (3) of the\npreliminary injunction under review is now effective pending further order of this court.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nMichael C. McGrail\nDeputy Clerk\nPage 2\n\nUSCA Case #25-5132      Document #2113309            Filed: 04/28/2025      Page 3 of 6\nRAO, Circuit Judge, dissenting: The panel today bars the \npolitical  leadership  of  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection \nBureau (CFPB) from reducing its workforce in accordance \nwith President Trump’s directives. Because the preliminary \ninjunction entered by the district court raises serious separation \nof powers concerns and has paved the way for ongoing judicial \nsupervision of an Executive Branch agency, I would continue \nthe stay pending appeal. \n* * *\nAt  the  end  of  March,  the  district  court  entered  a \npreliminary injunction prohibiting the CFPB from carrying out \nany reductions in force (RIFs), effectively freezing the staffing \nof the CFPB as it existed under the previous administration. \nThe government sought a stay of the injunction pending appeal, \nwhich we granted in substantial part on April 11. The stay \npermitted  RIFs  consistent  with  the  CFPB’s  statutory \nobligations. We also expedited consideration of the merits of \nthe preliminary injunction and scheduled oral argument for \nMay 16.  \nThe enjoined parties include the Acting Director and other \npolitical leadership of the CFPB, appointed by the President to \nimplement his agenda. With the preliminary injunction largely \nstayed, the CFPB’s leadership issued RIF notices to more than \n80 percent of the agency’s workforce. In a statement filed \nbelow,  the  agency’s  Chief  Legal  Officer  detailed  the \nparticularized assessment underlying the RIF and attested that \nthe  “employees  retained  were  sufficient  to  perform  the \nBureau’s  statutory  duties.”  Declaration  of  Mark  Paoletta, \nNTEU v. CFPB, 25-cv-381, ECF 109, at 4 (D.D.C. Apr. 18, \n2025). He further clarified that the employees subject to the \nRIF  would  remain  employed  for  sixty  days,  and  that  the \nagency’s leadership would “continuously assess the Bureau’s \nworkforce needs” and “make appropriate changes to ensure \ncompliance with statutory duties.” Id.  \n\nUSCA Case #25-5132      Document #2113309            Filed: 04/28/2025      Page 4 of 6\n2 \nRather than wait to  see if any harm materialized, the \nplaintiffs returned to the district court on the same day the RIF \nnotices  were  issued,  demanding  immediate  judicial \nintervention because it was “unfathomable” that the CFPB \ncould continue to provide statutorily required services if the \nRIF were executed. But the plaintiffs did not allege they had \nsuffered any specific harm or loss of service from the RIF. Nor \ncould they, since the employees subject to the RIF had not yet \nstopped working, much less been terminated. \nWithout any finding of particularized harm, the district \ncourt halted the RIF. Although the district court styled its \naction  as  a  temporary  restraining  order,  “the  label \nattached ... by the trial court is not decisive.” Adams v. Vance, \n570 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (cleaned up); see also Dep’t \nof Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025). I would \nconstrue the district court’s order prohibiting the RIF as a \nmodification  of  its  preliminary  injunction.  See  Dunlap  v. \nPresidential Advisory Comm’n on Election Integrity, 944 F.3d \n945,  948  (D.C.  Cir.  2019)  (“An  order  modifies  an  earlier \ninjunction when it actually changes the legal relationship of the \nparties to the decree.”) (cleaned up). As such, the order is \nimmediately appealable. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). If the district \ncourt abused its discretion in modifying the injunction, vacatur \nis the appropriate remedy. Klayman v. Porter, 104 F.4th 298, \n305 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \n* * * \nIn  my  view,  the  district  court’s  modification  of  the \ninjunction is inconsistent with the terms of this court’s April 11 \nstay and therefore an abuse of discretion.  \nThe April 11 stay did not create a preclearance regime \nwhereby  the  CFPB  must  obtain  judicial  approval  for  its \nmanagement decisions. Unfortunately, that is precisely what is \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5132      Document #2113309            Filed: 04/28/2025      Page 5 of 6\n3 \nunfolding below, as the district court has blocked a RIF while \nit determines, by its own lights, whether the CFPB’s staffing \nplans will be sufficient to fulfill general statutory requirements. \nSee NTEU v. CFPB, 25-cv-381, ECF 113, at 5–6 (D.D.C. Apr. \n18, 2025) (enjoining RIF and scheduling evidentiary hearing to \ndetermine whether planned staffing levels will leave agency \n“unable to comply with its statutory duties”); id., Minute Order \n(D.D.C.  Apr.  21,  2025)  (requiring  Chief  Legal  Officer  to \nappear  at  hearing  and  be  available  to  testify  about  his \nparticularized assessment).  \nThe  district  court’s  approach  turns  the  separation  of \npowers on its head. The execution of the laws, including the \nmanagement  of  administrative  agencies,  is  committed  to \nExecutive Branch officials under the direction of the President. \nSee U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3 (requiring the President to “take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed”). When agency \naction is challenged, courts have an essential obligation to say \nwhat the law is. But whatever the merits of this underlying \nlawsuit, the district court cannot erase the boundaries between \nthe courts and the Executive by setting up a temporary judicial \nreceivership  of  the  CFPB.  As  the  Supreme  Court  has \nadmonished, “it is not the role of courts, but that of the political \nbranches,  to  shape  the  institutions  of  government  in  such \nfashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.” Lewis \nv. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996); see also Dan Dobbs, Law \nof Remedies § 2.9(5) (2d ed. 1993) (“[J]udicial  control of \nlegislative  or  executive  branch  decisions  interferes \nsubstantially  with  the  separation  of  powers  system  of \ngovernment. If the judicial interference is substantial, judges \nthemselves may lose their distinctive judicial character if they \nbecome  managers  of  executive  departments  by  way  of \ninjunction.”).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5132      Document #2113309            Filed: 04/28/2025      Page 6 of 6\n4 \nWhile the April 11 stay left some parts of the preliminary \ninjunction in place based on the government’s concessions, it \nin no way authorized the district court to “inject[] [itself] into \nday-to-day  agency  management”  or  to  superintend  the \npersonnel decisions of the CFPB’s political leadership. Norton \nv. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 67 (2004). I would \nvacate the district court’s modification. \nTo the extent the stay was unclear, I would clarify that if \nthe  defendants’  actions  cause  a  plaintiff  to  lose  services \nrequired by statute, the district court may issue appropriate \nrelief, targeted to that plaintiff’s specific injury, under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62(d). See Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. \nv.  Sw.  Marine  Inc.,  242  F.3d  1163,  1166  (9th  Cir.  2001) \n(explaining that “any action taken pursuant to Rule 62[(d)] may \nnot materially alter the status of the case on appeal”) (cleaned \nup); Casey, 518 U.S. at 357 (“The remedy must of course be \nlimited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that \nthe plaintiff has established.”). In the alternative, if a partial \nstay is truly “unworkable,” I would put an end to these cat-and-\nmouse games and stay the preliminary injunction  entirely. \nTrump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 585 \n(2017) (Thomas, J., concurring in part). \n* * * \nThe  district  court  overstepped  our  stay.  Rather  than \nremedy  the  judicial  error,  today’s  order  hamstrings  the \nExecutive and prevents the CFPB from downsizing until the \nmerits  of  the  appeal  are  resolved.  The  lack  of  judicially \nmanageable  standards  in  this  posture  is  a  reason  to  leave \nexecution  of  the  laws  to  the  Executive,  not  the  courts.  I \nrespectfully dissent. \n ",

Over the past \nweek, the defendants had already been in the process of doing to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau what had been unprecedented until two weeks ago: \nunilaterally dismantling a federal agency established by Congress without any legal \nauthority to do so.  \nTonight, reports emerged that numerous employees have now been locked out \nof their phones and computers and are receiving form termination letters. Among \nthose employees was the Student Loan Ombudsman, whose position is specifically \nrequired by federal statute. A massive reduction in force that would shrink the agency \ndown to a handful of employees is reportedly in the works.1 \nThese actions are part of a coordinated campaign by the new administration to \neliminate  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau.  In  a  series  of  escalating \ndirectives, the defendants have suspended virtually all CFPB operations, fired dozens \nof  employees,  cancelled  over  $100  million  in  contracts,  and  closed  the  agency’s \nheadquarters. They have brought to a halt the processing of hundreds of thousands \nof consumer complaints—a function required by statute—including urgent cases \ninvolving  imminent  home  foreclosures.  They  have  suspended  all  supervision  of \nfinancial  institutions  and  enforcement  of  consumer  protection  laws.  They  have \n \n1 Laura Wamsley, Up to 100 more workers are fired at CFPB as staff fear mass \nlayoffs  are  looming,  NPR,  Feb.  13,  2025,  available  at \nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296929/cpfb-layoffs-staff-trump-doge. \n \n  1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 4 of 41\ndeclared their intent to return all of the agency's funding to the Federal Reserve, \nmaking it impossible for the CFPB to function at all.  \nThe defendants’ unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the \nAmericans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect. Take, for example, \none of the plaintiffs here, Pastor Eva Steege, who is 83 years old and in hospice care. \nHer  doctors  have  told  her  she  has  less  than  six  months  to  live.  After  years  of \nstruggling  to  navigate  the  complexities  of  student  loan  forgiveness,  she  finally \nsecured help from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to discharge her loans \nunder the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. The discharge would not only \nrelieve her of debt but also allow her to fulfill her dying wish: to lift a stressful \nfinancial burden from her loved ones.  \nBut on February 10, just hours before her scheduled meeting with CFPB staff, \nPastor Steege received an email: Due to “new guidance,” her meeting was cancelled. \nNo new meeting was scheduled. The CFPB’s Private Education Loan Ombudsman's \nOffice—which was established by Congress and is required by statute to provide \n“timely assistance to borrowers”—had been ordered to cease all work. \nThose who have devoted their careers to helping vulnerable consumers also \nface harsh consequences. One terminated CFPB employee is seven months pregnant. \nNow she has to face a job market as someone who must take leave immediately upon \nbeing hired or forego the time she was supposed to spend bonding with her child. And \nif she doesn’t secure a job, her family will be unable to pay their mortgage, leaving \nher no choice but to uproot her newly expanded family. Another employee has had \n \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 5 of 41\nboth her spouse and child diagnosed with cancer in just the last 30 days. Without her \nemployment-based medical benefits, they will not be able to continue treatments or \nafford surgeries—with possible death the result.  \nThe law doesn’t permit this wholesale dismantling of an agency created by \nCongress—and the tremendous harms that flow from it. Neither the President nor \nhis appointees have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency created by \nstatute. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress established the CFPB \nand charged it with supervising financial institutions and protecting consumers. \nCongress  imposed  numerous  mandatory  duties  on  the  agency,  from  processing \nconsumer complaints to examining banks to protecting student loan borrowers. Only \nCongress—not the Executive Branch—has the power to eliminate those duties or \ndissolve the agency created to perform them. \nYet that is exactly what the defendants have done. President Trump has \ndeclared his intent to “totally eliminate[]” the CFPB. And to accomplish that goal, he \nhas installed Russell Vought as Acting Director through an appointment that violated \nboth the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. \nVought then issued a series of directives that effectively nullified Congress’s statutory \ncommands. He ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations—including \nthose that explicitly delegated by law to the CFPB. He cancelled the contracts that \nenabled the agency to fulfill its statutory duties. And he is poised to eliminate the \nagency’s workforce and return its funding, making it impossible for the CFPB to \nfunction at all. \n \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 6 of 41\nThese  actions  violate  bedrock  constitutional  principles  and  federal  law  in \nmultiple ways. First, by attempting to eliminate a federal agency and its statutory \nduties  without  congressional  authorization,  the  defendants  have  violated  the \nseparation of powers. Second, because Vought was neither nominated nor confirmed \nby the Senate, and because the President fired the previous Director, the Federal \nVacancies Reform Act is inapplicable, Vought’s appointment was unlawful, and his \nactions are all ultra vires. Third, the defendants’ conduct violates the Administrative \nProcedure Act because it exceeds their statutory authority, is contrary to law, and is \narbitrary and capricious. \nThe consequences of these violations are devastating and irreparable. Over 70 \nCFPB employees were fired earlier this week; all term employees were reportedly \nfired tonight; and nearly all remaining employees face imminent termination. Pastor \nSteege will likely die without discharging her loans, leaving her family with debt \nrather than the thousands in overpayments they are owed. The Virginia Poverty Law \nCenter can no longer help its clients resolve predatory lending disputes through the \nCFPB’s complaint system—a process that previously took minutes and achieved \nremarkable results, like halving interest rates and monthly payments. Thousands of \nother consumers who rely on the CFPB’s complaint system have lost a critical lifeline \nfor resolving urgent financial disputes. The NAACP was actively working with the \nCFPB to protect NAACP members who live in Altadena, California, and had been \ntargeted by predatory fraudsters in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires. The freeze \nhas abruptly halted that collaboration. \n \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 7 of 41\nThis Court should act swiftly to prevent further irreparable harm by issuing \nan  administrative  stay  immediately  and  then  a  temporary  restraining  order \nenjoining  the  defendants’  unlawful  conduct.  The  public  interest  and  balance  of \nequities weigh decisively in favor of preserving the status quo and preventing the \ndefendants from unilaterally dissolving an agency that Congress created to protect \nAmerican consumers. \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n \n  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress created the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. See Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act, P.L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (July 21, 2010). Congress directed the \nCFPB to “regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products or \nservices,” and tasked it with “ensuring that all consumers have access to markets for \nconsumer  financial  products  and  services”  that  “are  fair,  transparent,  and \ncompetitive.” 12 U.S.C. §§ 5491(a), 5511(a). The Dodd-Frank Act not only established \na  series  of  new  responsibilities  for  the  Bureau,  but  also  “transferred  the \nadministration of 18 existing federal statutes to the CFPB, including the Fair Credit \nReporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Truth in Lending Act.” \nSeila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 206 (2020).2 Among \nother things, the CFPB’s responsibilities include: \n \n2  Unless  otherwise  specified,  all  internal  quotation  marks,  emphases, \nalterations, and citations are omitted from quotations throughout. \n \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 8 of 41\n  Monitoring and responding to consumer complaints. Congress instructed \nthat the CFPB’s director “shall establish a unit” within the Bureau “whose functions \ninclude … the centralized collection of, monitoring of, and response to consumer \ncomplaints  regarding  consumer  financial  products  or  services.”  12 U.S.C. \n§ 5493(b)(3)(A). That unit must “establish[] a single, toll-free telephone number, a \nwebsite, and a database” to carry out those duties. Id. The CFPB is further required \nto “establish … reasonable procedures to provide a timely response to consumers” for \ncomplaints or inquiries. Id. § 5534(a). \n  Research,  reporting,  and  information  obligations.  The  CFPB  has \nnumerous research, reporting, and information obligations imposed by statute. For \nexample, the CFPB is required to “research[], analyz[e], and report[]” on market \ndevelopments  for  consumer  financial  products  or  services  and  consumer \nunderstanding  of  and  access  to  financial  products,  among  other  things.  Id. \n§ 5493(b)(1). In addition, it is required to publish and disseminate information about \ncredit rates and credit cards. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1646(a), (b); id. § 1632(d)(3). And the \nCFPB must “provide staff and data processing resources” to the Federal Financial \nInstitutions Examination Council, 12 U.S.C. § 2809(b), to compile information on \ndepository institutions and aggregate lending patterns, id. § 2809(a). \nSubject matter specific offices. Congress further required the CFPB to \nperform work targeted at specific consumer-protection activities and for specific \ngroups. For example, the CFPB must have a Private Education Loan Ombudsman \n“to provide timely assistance to borrowers of private education loans.” Id. § 5535(a). \n \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 9 of 41\nAmong other things, the Ombudsman is required to “compile and analyze data on \nborrower complaints regarding private education loans” and, in accordance with \nregulations, “receive, review, and attempt to resolve informally complaints” from loan \nborrowers. Id. § 5535(c)(1), (3).  \nSupervision and enforcement. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB broad \nsupervisory authority to examine financial institutions for compliance with federal \nconsumer financial laws. 12 U.S.C. §§ 5514, 5515. For instance, the CFPB “shall \nrequire reports and conduct examinations on a periodic basis” of payday lenders and \nprivate  education  lenders,  and  “larger  participant[s]”  in  certain  markets  for  a \nconsumer financial product or service, Id. § 5514(a)(1)(B), (D)–(E), (b)(1). And it “shall \nhave exclusive authority to require reports and conduct examinations on a periodic \nbasis” of insured depository institutions and credit unions with more than $10 billion \nin assets. Id. § 5515(b)(1).  \nThe CFPB also is vested with potent enforcement powers, with authority to \nconduct investigations, issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands, initiate \nadministrative adjudications, and prosecute civil actions in federal court. Id. §§ 5562, \n5564(a),  (f).  The  statute  also  empowers  the  CFPB  “to  conduct  hearings  and \nadjudication proceedings … to ensure or enforce compliance with” the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Act, CFPB’s rules, and any other federal law that the CFPB is \nauthorized to enforce. Id. § 5563(a).  \nRulemaking. The Act also confers rulemaking authority on the CFPB. See 12 \nU.S.C.  §  5512(b).  For  example,  the  CFPB  has  the  authority  to  prescribe  rules \n \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 10 of 41\nidentifying practices that are “unfair, deceptive, or abusive,” id. § 5531(b), and rules \nimposing disclosure requirements to help consumers understand the terms, benefits, \ncosts, and risks of financial products and services, id. § 5532; see also id. § 5533. The \nCFPB also has rulemaking authority pursuant to 19 federal statutes that govern \nnumerous consumer activities and services, including debt collection practices, debit \ncard transfers, overdraft services, consumer leases, mortgage lending, credit card \nlending, mortgage appraisals, real estate settlement practices, and credit reporting. \nSee id. § 5581(a)(1)(A), (b).3  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  Despite  Congress’s  “establish[ment]”  of  the  CFPB—which  it  said  “shall \nregulate … consumer financial products or services,” 12 U.S.C. § 5491(a)—President \nTrump  is  resolved  to  “totally  eliminate[]”  the  agency.4  The  President  has  not, \n \n3 See Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 3801, et seq.; \nthe Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1667, et seq.; the Electronic Funds \nTransfer Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693, et seq., except with respect to section 920; the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691, et seq.; the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 \nU.S.C. §§ 1666, et seq.; the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681, et seq., \nexcept with respect to sections 1681m(e) and 1681w; the Homeowners Protection Act \nof 1998, 12 U.S.C. §§ 4901, et seq.; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§§ 1692, et seq.; subsections (b) through (f) of section 43 of the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 1831t(c)-(f); sections 502 through 509 of the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6802-6809, except for section 6805 as it applies to \nsection 6801(b); the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, 12 U.S.C. §§ 2801, et seq.; \nthe Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, 15 U.S.C. § 1639; the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.; the S.A.F.E. \nMortgage Licensing Act of 2008, 12 U.S.C. §§5101, et seq.; the Truth in Lending Act \n(TILA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601, et seq.; the Truth in Savings Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 4301, et \nseq.; section 626 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, P.L. 111-8 § 626; the \nInterstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1701, et seq.; and many \nprovisions of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, Dodd-Frank Act \nTitle XIV, Subtitles A, B, C, and E, and §§ 1471, 1472, 1475, and 1476).  \n4 https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/1889132023933022283?mx=2. \n \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 11 of 41\nhowever, lobbied Congress to repeal or amend the law it passed establishing the \nCFPB. Instead, he has sought to eliminate the agency entirely through executive \nbranch action.  \nI.  President Trump illegally installs Russell Vought to run the CFPB, \nand Vought brings the Bureau’s work to a halt \nTrump’s effort to eliminate the CFPB began by firing then-Director Rohit \nChopra on February 1, 2025.5 Two days later, the President named the Secretary of \nthe Treasury as the Acting Director of the CFPB.6 That same day, the Acting Director \nsent an email, titled “Instruction from Acting Director,” directing all CFPB staff and \ncontractors to “immediately” suspend activities in six areas of work.7 The email told \nall workers that they were required:   \n•  “[n]ot to approve or issue any proposed or final rules or formal or \ninformal guidance”;  \n•  “[t]o suspend the effective dates of all final rules that have been \nissued or published but that have not yet become effective”;  \n•  “[n]ot  to  commence,  take  additional  investigative  activities \nrelated to, or settle enforcement actions”;  \n•  “[n]ot  to  issue  public  communications  of  any  type,  including \npublication of research papers”; \n•  “[n]ot to approve or execute any material agreements, including \nrelated to employee matters or contractors”; and  \n \n5  https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/03/trump-names-scott-bessent-acting-cfpb-\nhead.html https. \n6 https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/1889132023933022283?mx=2. \n7  https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-about-cfpb-examinations-and-\nother-\n7336474/#:~:text=As%20we%20previously%20blogged%20about,or%20formal%20or\n%20informal%20guidance. \n \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 12 of 41\n•  “[n]ot to make or approve filings or appearances by the Bureau in \nany litigation, other than to seek a pause in proceedings.” \nAny exception to those requirements had to be expressly approved by the Acting \nDirector. The next day, the Acting Director “[u]pdated” his directive to expand the \nwork stoppage to include not “initiat[ing] supervisory designation proceedings or \ndesignate any nondepository institution for supervision.”8  \n  Three days later, on Friday February 7, President Trump named Russell \nVought—the Director of the Office of Management and Budget—as the new Acting \nDirector of the CFPB.9 That same day, Elon Musk and other members of the so-called \n“Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) accessed CFPB’s headquarters and \ncomputer systems.10 Several hours later, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a tombstone \nemoji on his social-media site X.11  \nThe next day, Vought sent a Bureau-wide email.12 The email further expanded \non the prior work-stoppage directive, adding to the list a command to “[c]ease all \nsupervision and examination activity” and “[c]ease all stakeholder engagement.”13  \n \n8  https://prospect.org/economy/2025-02-07-bessent-gives-musk-present-\nstalling-cfpb-oversight-big-tech/ \n9  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-\ntrump.html \n10  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/elon-musk-team-cfpb-00203119; \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/10/trump-vs-cfpb-russ-vought-\norders-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-to-stop-work/. \n11 https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1887979940269666769. \n12  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/cfpb-vought-staff-finance-\nwatchdog.html. \n13  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/cfpb-vought-staff-finance-\nwatchdog.html. \n \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 13 of 41\nAround an hour later, Vought posted on X that he “ha[d] notified the Federal \nReserve that CFPB will not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding \nbecause it is not ‘reasonably necessary’ to carry out its duties.”14  \nOn Sunday evening, February 9 (two days after Vought was appointed), the \nCFPB’s  Chief  Operating  Officer  sent  an  email  to  all  staff  stating  that  CFPB’s \nheadquarters  would  close  the  next  day  and  instructing  “[e]mployees  and \ncontractors … to work remotely unless instructed otherwise from our Acting Director \nor his designee.”15 No reason was given for the closure.  \nVought sent another all staff email the next morning reiterating that CFPB’s \n“DC headquarters building is closed this week.”16 That email directed all CFPB staff \n“not [to] perform any work tasks” at all and that “employees should stand down from \nperforming any work task.”17  \nTwo days later, Vought cancelled $100 million dollars in contracts and fired 70 \nemployees.18 As this is being filed late Thursday evening, more employees are being \n \n14 https://x.com/russvought/status/1888423503537360986. \n15  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/russell-vought-consumer-bureau-\nprotect-hq-close.html;  see  https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cfpbs-headquarters-be-\nclosed-coming-week-email-says-2025-02-09/. \n16  https://www.hrgrapevine.com/us/content/article/2025-02-11-stand-down-\nconsumer-watchdog-agency-staff-in-state-of-confusion-after-being-ordered-to-stop-\nwork \n17  https://www.hrgrapevine.com/us/content/article/2025-02-11-stand-down-\nconsumer-watchdog-agency-staff-in-state-of-confusion-after-being-ordered-to-stop-\nwork \n18  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/cfpb-nixes-all-expert-witness-\ncontracts-in-enforcement-shutdown \n \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 14 of 41\nfired. Kaspar Decl. ¶ 25. The expectation is that Vought will soon lay-off as many as \n95% of the CFPB’s remaining employees. Kaspar Decl. ¶ 13.   \nII.  The fallout from the stop-work order.  \nBecause the Bureau depends on its people to function, the stop-work order and \ncancellation of contracts has effectively shuttered the agency. The fallout is wreaking \nhavoc already. \nCFPB’s consumer-complaint functions. Take, for example, the Consumer \nResponse division. Consumer Response is responsible for carrying out Congress’s \nmandate  to  “collect[],”  “monitor,”  and  secure  a  “timely  response”  to  consumer \ncomplaints  about  financial  products.  See  12 U.S.C.  §§ 5493(b)(3)(A),  5534(a). \nConsumer Response receives hundreds-of-thousands of complaints a month. Meyer \nDecl. ¶ 11. They come from various sources—a toll-free hotline, web submissions, the \nmail, agency referrals, and Congress—and they cover the full range of consumer \nfinancial products, from debt collection, to foreclosure, to credit reporting issues and \nmore. Meyer Decl. ¶ 9. Consumers normally lodge complaints in times of urgency—\nfor example, when they are facing foreclosure or an error in their credit report has \nprevented them from obtaining a loan to buy a car for work or to drive their kids to \nschools. Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 21–24.  \nConsumer Response has established a system that efficiently handles these \nhundreds of thousands of complaints, but that system depends on Bureau staff and \ncontractors to function. The most urgent complaints—for example, those that involve \nimminent foreclosure—are routed to an Escalated Case Management Team. Meyer \n \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 15 of 41\nDecl. ¶ 17. That team gives personalized attention to over a thousand complaints per \nyear. Id.  \nAnd even if a complaint is not escalated, many complaints still need staff or \ncontractor assistance just to get routed to the company that is the subject of the \ncomplaint. Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 13–17. That includes complaints submitted through the \nhotline, the mail, or agency referrals. Meyer Decl. ¶ 15. Complaints needing to be \nmanually processed also include any complaint about a company that’s not already \nin the CFPB’s system or any complaint where the consumer made a typo or otherwise \ntyped the company name differently from the CFPB’s system. Meyer Decl. ¶ 13. The \nBureau also maintains a special portal to facilitate referrals from Congress, with each \nsubmission being assigned a case worker. Blumenthal Decl. ¶¶ 9–10. \nEven the complaints that can be automatically routed to companies—those \nsubmitted through Consumer Response’s online portal about a company already in \nthe system—depend on back-end contractor support. Meyer Decl. ¶ 28. The complaint \nvolume is so high that without constant maintenance on the electronic system, it will \ncrash. Id.  \nThe substantial resources that go into this system produces efficient and \neffective results. 98 percent of complaints receive a response in under 15 days. Meyer \nDecl. ¶ 15. And consumers regularly find that the results exceed what they were able \nto achieve without help from the Bureau. Meyer Decl. ¶ 19; Blumenthal Decl. ¶ 9. \n \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 16 of 41\nApproximately forty percent of complaints result in some form of relief from the \ncompany. 2024 Consumer Response Annual Report at 9.19 \nVought’s stop-work order has left Consumer Response no longer operational. \nMeyer Decl. ¶¶ 25–29. The only remaining function is the work of the contractor-run \ncall center that answers the hotline—the contract for which was initially cancelled \nand then “un-terminated”—but consumer response does not function with that little \nsupport. Meyer Decl. ¶ 27. There is no “Escalated Case Management team” to help \n“consumers with imminent foreclosures or to facilitate other time-sensitive complaint \nresolution  when  the  company  does  not  adequately  respond.”  Meyer  Decl.  ¶ 26. \nComplaints submitted “about companies that are not already in the [CFPB’s] system \nare not being processed at all,” and “no one is processing referrals from agencies or \nCongress.” Id. “By now, there are likely thousands of complaints that have gone \nunprocessed.” Id. Even for those that have been processed, “no one is monitoring \ncompany response times to the complaints,” “ensuring that companies respond at all \nto  those  complaints,  or  bringing  companies  to  the  attention  of  the  enforcement \ndivision.”  Id.;  contra  12 U.S.C.  §§ 5493(b)(3)(A),  5534(a).  And  “the  automated \ncomplaint function is likely to break down soon”—because it requires continuance \nback-end technological support to avoid crashing—bringing the last vestiges of the \nBureau’s consumer complaint function to a halt. Meyer Decl. ¶ 28. In fact, the system \n \n19  https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cr-annual-report_2023-\n03.pdf \n \n  14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 17 of 41\nalready appears to be breaking down—complaints filed after January 29, 2025 appear \nto be missing. Meyer Decl. ¶ 29.    \nThe elimination of this critical—statutorily mandated—resource will work \nserious  harms.  As  the  experience  of  plaintiff  Virginia  Poverty  Law  Center \ndemonstrates, consumers frequently rely on it to successful resolve disputes. Speer \nDec. ¶ 10. To take just one example, after a Center client used Consumer Response, \na lender that had previously maintained that it was not subject to state usury law \nhalved the consumer’s payments and drastically cut her interest rate. Speer Dec. \n¶ 12.  Without that resource, the Center will struggle to achieve similar results for \nother consumers. Id. ¶ 16. And even if it can secure the results, the significant \nincrease in time required will prevent the Center from doing other critical work and \nserving other clients. Id. \nMembers of Congress are in the same boat. As Senator Blumenthal explains, \nthe Bureau set up a Consumer Response portal for their use with assigned case \nworkers. Blumenthal Dec. ¶ 7. And the results are frequently successful. Blumenthal \nDec. ¶ 9. Without that resource, the Senator’s staff will, similar to the Center, be \nforced  to  take  time  away  from  other  constituent  work  to  get  the  same  results. \nBlumenthal Dec. ¶¶ 12–13. \nAnd the scale of the harm is tremendous.  Over a million people use the \nconsumer-complaint mechanism each year. 2024 Annual Report at 9. More than 40 \npercent of those people secure some form of relief through the process. Id. at 9, 18. \nMore than ten thousand people get monetary relief. Id. at 18. So as a result of the \n \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 18 of 41\nstop-work  order,  the  next  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  facing  wrongful \nforeclosure, in urgent need of a loan blocked by a faulty credit report, unable to access \ntheir bank accounts, and much more will lose access to a critical resource. Meyer Decl. \n¶¶ 21–24. \nPrivate Education Loan Ombudsman’s office. The Ombudsman’s office—\nresponsible for implementing Congress’s mandate to provide timely assistance to \nborrowers of education loans who lodge complaints with the bureau, see 12 U.S.C. § \n5535—has  met  the  same  fate.  The  ombudsman’s  office  receives  thousands  of \ncomplaints annually from education borrowers about inaccurate billing statements, \nyearslong processing delays, inability to reach lenders, and the refusal of lenders to \nprovide refunds in the thousands of dollars. 2024 Annual Report of the CFPB Student \nLoan Ombudsman at 9.20  And CFPB employees assist in the resolution of hundreds \nof these complaints each month. 2024 Annual Report of the CFPB Student Loan \nOmbudsman at 9.  \nThe Ombudsman’s office has an enormous effect on borrowers. Its work has \nfreed college transcripts withheld as collateral to secure payment, allowing borrowers \nto search for employment; secured thousands of dollars in refunds; and brought to an \nend yearslong waits for responses from lenders. 2024 Annual Report of the CFPB \nStudent Loan Ombudsman at 12, 20, 57.  \n \n20  https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_2024-annual-student-\nloan-ombudsmans-report_2024-11.pdf. \n \n  16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 19 of 41\nThose who rely on the Ombudsman’s office, like those who rely on Consumer \nResponse, have now lost a critical resource. The Ombudsman’s office is no longer \nprocessing complaints. Steege Decl. ¶ 6.  Indeed, just hours ago, Vought fired the \nOmbudsman.  \nPastor Steege exemplifies the harms that consumers are already suffering. \nPastor Steege is 83 years old and now in hospice, with her doctors putting her life \nexpectancy  at  six  months.  Steege  Decl.  ¶ 1.  She  is  entitled  to  have  her  loans \ndischarged under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and the CFPB was \nhelping her complete that process. Steege Decl. ¶¶ 2–5. Discharging the loan before \nshe dies would allow Pastor Steege to avoid leaving her family with a significant \nburden and instead leave them with thousands of dollars in refunded overpayments. \nId. ¶ 9.  Pastor Steege had a meeting scheduled with the CFPB, but that meeting has \nnow been cancelled. Id. ¶¶ 4–7.  Without the Bureau’s assistance, Pastor Steege does \nnot know how she can discharge her loans before passes away. \nOther harm from the stop-work order. The harm from the stop-work order \nis  not  limited  to  those  who  rely  on  Consumer  Response  or  the  Education \nOmbudsman’s Office. It is widespread. The CFPB was working with the NAACP to \nhelp consumers who were victims of the Los Angeles fires. Bross Decl. ¶¶ 3–5. That \nwork has stopped. See id. Homeowners who were subject to illegal foreclosure actions \nwere entitled to receive compensation—compensation that might enable them to save \ntheir homes. Rheingold Decl. ¶ 23. They now will not receive that compensation. See \nid. Pending litigation against companies that preyed on consumers has been halted. \n \n  17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 20 of 41\nThe supervision of large financial services companies has stopped. Virtually all of the \nCFPB’s  work  protecting  ordinary  Americans  and  serving  law-abiding  financial \ninstitutions has stopped.  \nIII.  Anticipated drastic cuts will work immense harms on Bureau staff. \nThe Bureau’s closure has already inflicted great harm on its employees. As of \nthe time of this filing, mass firings are underway, and more than seventy employees \nhave already been fired. Kaspar Decl. ¶¶ 15, 25. Many of the employees who have lost \ntheir jobs (or will in the immediate future) are members of the National Treasury \nEmployees Union or the CFPB Employee Association. Id.; First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, \n18. Those fired employees have lost their income and health insurance. Kaspar Decl. \n¶ 17–19. And the consequences have been personally devastating. “One employee \nreports that both their spouse and their child received cancer diagnoses … within the \nlast 30 days, and without medical benefits they will not be able to continue with \ntreatments or obtain necessary surgeries, which could ultimately result in their \ndeaths.” Id. ¶ 18. Others are facing $8,000 out-of-pocket medical bills to pay for \nessential medicines. Id. ¶ 17.  \nThe harms aren’t limited to medical treatment. Some employees relocated to \nWashington, D.C. from lower cost-of-living areas just for their jobs at the Bureau and \nare now saddled with leases and mortgages they can’t afford. Id. ¶ 19. Their children \nwill have to be withdrawn from their current schools and communities so that their \nparents can move to more affordable places. Id. Another former employee is seven \nmonths pregnant, which “severely hinder[s]” her chances of finding a new job. Id. \n¶ 21. She requested maternity leave prior to her termination, but now will be forced \n \n  18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 21 of 41\nto try and find work during the time that she should have been bonding with her \nnewborn child so that her family can afford its mortgage. Id.    \n           The  Bureau’s  current  employees—however  few  of  them  may  be  left—are \nsuffering, too.

Bessent, \n2025 WL 450488, at *1 (D.D.C. 2025). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The plaintiffs are very likely to succeed on the merits. \nThe defendants’ actions are as unprecedented as they are unlawful: Until two \nweeks ago, never before had an Administration attempted to unilaterally eliminate a \nfederal agency created by Congress. It is thus unsurprising that this conduct violates \nour constitutional structure and federal law in multiple, independent ways. The \nplaintiffs bring four causes of action challenging the defendants’ actions to suspend \n \n  20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 23 of 41\nor terminate the CFPB: (1) the defendants’ actions violate the constitutional principle \nof the separation of powers; (2) defendant Vought’s actions are ultra vires because \nthey violate the Appointments Clause; (3) the defendants’ decision to shut down \nCFPB violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), because \nit exceeds their statutory authority; and (4) the defendants’ decision to shut down \nCFPB violates the APA, § 706(2)(A), because it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. The plaintiffs are overwhelmingly \nlikely to succeed on each claim. \nA.  Separation of powers. To start, the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their claim that the defendants’ actions to shut down CFPB violate the \nconstitutional principle of the separation of powers. “The President’s power, if any, to \nissue [an] order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution \nitself.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952). But “[t]here \nis no statute that expressly authorizes the President to” shutdown the CFPB—either \nhimself or through his appointee—“[n]or is there any act of Congress . . . from which \nsuch a power can be fairly implied.” Id.  \nHere, the defendants’ actions to shut down the CFPB—including by issuing \nstop-work orders, cancelling contracts, declining and returning funding, and firing \nemployees en masse—is contrary to and thus effectively repeals multiple mandatory \nstatutory duties that Congress imposed. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, titled the \nConsumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFP Act) established the CFPB as an \n“independent bureau” and required the CFPB to perform a number of activities. 12 \n \n  21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 24 of 41\nU.S.C. § 5491(a), For example, Congress required the CFPB to “collect[],” “monitor[],” \nand “respon[d],” to consumer complaints, id. § 5493(b)(3)(A); see id. § 5534. Congress \ninstructed that the Bureau “shall” establish a “toll-free telephone number” to handle \nconsumer complaints. Id. § 5493(b)(3)(A). And it required that there “shall” be a \nprivate education loan ombudsmen to “to provide timely assistance to borrowers of \nprivate education loans.” Id. § 5535(a). The defendants actions are directly contrary \nto those statutory commands. \nWhat’s more, the defendants’ actions are contrary to Congress’s conscious \ndeliberate statutory choice to structure the CFPB so that it can weather political \nchange. For example, when the agency is missing a director, Congress has instructed \nthat the deputy director shall automatically take over. See id. § 5491(b)(5). And \nCongress  has  “provid[ed]  the  Bureau  a  standing  source  of  funding  outside  the \nordinary annual appropriations process”—creating a “shield[] . . . from the influence \nof the political branches” that the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld. Consumer \nFin. Prot. Bureau v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n of Am., Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 422 (2024).  \nThe defendants’ actions have thus seized power that Congress has reserved to \nitself. The Constitution prohibits these power grabs. Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585. \nBecause Congress established the CFPB without any mechanism for the Executive to \ndismantle it, “only Congress can take [it] away.” Helvering v. Or. Mut. Life Ins. Co., \n311 U.S. 267, 272 (1940).  \nThat same conclusion would hold even if the defendants were to claim that \nthey are shutting down only parts of the agency rather than the agency as a whole. \n \n  22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 25 of 41\nThe Executive Branch has no more power to exercise an after-the-fact line-item veto \nthan it does to functionally repeal the law wholesale. See Clinton v. City of New York, \n524 U.S. 417, 421 (1998) (holding that statute that permitted the President to veto \nonly a portion of a statute while signing the rest into force violated the Presentment \nClause, Art. I, § 7, cl. 2, of the Constitution). For example, by ordering the Student \nLoan  Ombudsman  and  the  agency’s  Consumer  Response  offices  to  cease  work, \nVought’s  actions  nullify  direct  Congress’s  statutory  commands—with  severe \nconsequences. Vought’s stop-work order is unconstitutional.  \nB. Unconstitutional appointment as Acting Director. The plaintiffs are \nalso very likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Vought was not lawfully \nappointed as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and thus \nall of his actions to date are ultra vires. The Constitution mandates that the President \nobtain “the Advice and Consent of the Senate” before appointing “Officers of the \nUnited States.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. This requirement of Senate confirmation \nis a critical “structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme,” envisioned by the \nFramers as “‘an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President’ and a \nguard against ‘the appointment of unfit characters.’” N.L.R.B. v. SW Gen., Inc., 580 \nU.S. 288, 293 (2017) (quoting The Federalist No. 76, p. 457 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. \nHamilton)). \nThe Director of the CFPB is a principal officer of the United States requiring \nthis Senate confirmation. Vought, however, was neither nominated to serve as the \nDirector  nor  confirmed  by  the  senate.  His  appointment  is  lawful,  then,  only  if \n \n  23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 26 of 41\nCongress gave authority to the President to install Vought outside the ordinary \nadvice-and-consent process (and only if that grant is itself constitutional).  \nPresident Trump purported to appoint Vought as an Acting Director under the \nauthority of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The Act allows the President to \ntemporarily fill a role for which Senate confirmation is required when the prior office \nholder “dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the \noffice.” 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). That assignment, though temporary, may be substantial, \nlasting as long as 210 days. Id. § 3346.  \nThe Act does not apply here. The last Senate-confirmed Director of the CFPB, \nRohit Chopra, did not die. He did not resign. And he was not “unable to perform the \nfunctions and duties of the office.” Id. § 3345(a). Instead, President Trump fired him. \nThe  Act  gives  the  President  no  authority  to  appoint  a  temporary  head  in  this \ncircumstance: where the vacancy is of the President’s own making rather than outside \nthe President’s control. See United States v. Valencia, 2018 WL 6182755, at *4 (W.D. \nTex. Nov. 27, 2018) (“Had [former Attorney General Jeff] Sessions chosen to refuse to \nresign the President could have exercised his authority to fire him, which would make \nthe statute inapplicable.”). And that makes sense, as the authority the President \nclaimed here would allow a complete end-round around the Constitution’s advice-\nand-consent requirement. A president could simply fire an agency head and then \nappoint a series of temporary replacements, and thus evade the Senate. \nThis case presents especially stark defiance of the Constitution’s advice-and-\nconsent requirement. The appointment of Vought is not the product of anything \n \n  24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 27 of 41\nurgent. President Trump waited until two weeks into his term to fire Chopra and only \nnow  has  nominated  a  replacement  only  yesterday.  Rather  than  make  a  timely \nnomination  and  work  to  get  that  person  confirmed,  he  appointed  without  any \nstatutory authority a person intent on destroying the agency that Congress has \ncreated and repeatedly declined to dissolve and whose funding structure the Supreme \nCourt recently upheld.21  \nIn addition, Vought hasn’t even stopped at exercising illegal authority over the \nCFPB. He has also seized the power of the Secretary of Education, too. Congress gave \nthe  Secretary  of  Treasury  the  power  to  name  as  the  “Private  Education  Loan \nOmbudsman.” 12 U.S.C. § 5535(a). By instructing the Ombudsman—and her entire \noffice—not to work, and to leave people like Pastor Steege hanging in the balance, \nVought has grabbed power delegated by law to the Education Secretary. \nThe plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed on their claim that Vought’s \nactions to suspend or terminate the CFPB and its statutorily mandated activities are \nultra vires. \nC. Violations of the Administrative Procedure Act.  The APA empowers \ncourts to set aside final agency action that is, among other things, “not in accordance \n \n21 Congress notably has not left the CFPB with a leadership void in a situation \nlike  this.    In  the  same  section  providing  that  the  CFPB,  which  was  originally \nenvisions as an independent agency with a director removed only for cause, Congress \nprovided that the Deputy Director will automatically become the director in the \n“absence” of the director. 12 U.S.C. § 5491(b)(5). The Deputy Director remains at the \nCFPB.  \n \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 28 of 41\nwith  law,”  “arbitrary  [and]  capricious,”  or  carried  out  “without  observance  of \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D).  \nAs an initial matter, the defendants’ actions to shut down the CFPB, including \nby  issuing  stop-work  instructions,  cancelling  contracts,  declining  and  returning \nfunding, firing employees, and terminating the lease for its headquarters, constitute \nfinal agency action. The Supreme Court has identified two factors to determine \nwhether agency action is final: first, the action must “mark the consummation of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process,” rather than be merely “tentative,” and, second, the \naction “must be one by which “rights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997).  \nBoth requirements are satisfied here. First, nothing about the defendants’ \ndecision to eliminate the CFPB is tentative.  CFPB employees have been instructed \nto stop working immediately—and they have done so. See Halperin Decl. ¶¶ 4–5. The \nBureau has cancelled $100 million in contracts.22 It has stopped Consumer Response \nfrom functioning.  Meyer Decl. ¶ 29.  The ombudsman’s office has stopped working \nand cancelled, without rescheduling, appointments, as Pastor Steege’s experience \nshows. Steege Decl. ¶ 7. And Vought has fired or is about to fire nearly all employees. \nThese actions are the consummation of agency decisionmaking. See, e.g., Biden v. \nTexas, 597 U.S. 785, 808–09 (2022) (Department of Homeland Security decision to \n \n22  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/cfpb-cancels-more-than-100-\nmillion-in-contracts-amid-doge-probe. \n \n  26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 29 of 41\nend the Migrant Protection Protocols program was final agency action because it \nforbade staff “to continue the program in any way from that moment on”). \nSecond,  legal  consequences  flow  from  Vought’s  stop-work  order,  and  it \ndetermines the “rights” of affected individuals. See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178. As this \nCourt has explained, when a statute creates a right to agency resources, a rule that \ndeprives people of it constitutes agency action. See Drs. for Am. v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., \n2025 WL 452707, at *6 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025) (collecting cases and issuing TRO to \nrestore CDC websites that had been taken offline). As noted above, the Ombudsman’s \noffice and Consumer Response unit were created to comply with a specific statutory \ndirective. See 12 U.S.C. § 5535(a). And Pastor Steege, for example, had a statutory right \nto receive assistance from the Ombudsman. That right has been nullified. See 12 \nU.S.C. § 5535. Virginia Poverty Law Center’s clients have a statutory right to lodge \ncomplaints—and receive the assistance that follows—through the Bureau’s consumer \nresponse unit. Speer Decl. ¶ 10. That right has been nullified.  \nVought’s work to shutter the agency has also determined the rights of NTEU’s \nand the Association’s members. It has completely deprived dozens of individuals of \nemployment and the attendant benefits. And even for those who have not yet been \nremoved, the decisions are clearly not spur-of-the-moment but carefully planned, \nevidenced by the logistics of firing so many people alone. Further, NTEU’s members \ncan only receive 10 days of administrative leave per year. 5 C.F.R. § 630.1404. \nAlthough Vought did not use the label “administrative leave” in his stop-work order, \nit is defined as occurring when an “employee is not engaged in activities that qualify \n \n  27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 30 of 41\nas official hours of work” but suffers no reduction in compensation—exactly what \nhappened here. See 5 C.F.R. § 630.1402. That cap on administrative leave will thus \nbe reached for everyone in just over a week. That, too, is a legal consequence flowing \nfrom Vought’s directive. \nIn particular, because of the defendants’ decision to shut down the agency, over \na thousand employees have been placed on administrative leave, and the agency has \nstopped fulfilling its legal obligations, as described above.  \nAnd this final agency action, in turn, violates the APA in multiple ways. First, \nthe plaintiffs are likely to succeed in establishing that is the defendants’ actions \nexceed their statutory authority in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because no \ndefendant possess the statutory authority to require CFPB to cease the activities that \nCongress mandated it to perform. Congress established the CFPB and charged it with \nnumerous mandatory duties, including, among others: processing and responding to \nconsumer complaints about covered financial institutions, 12 U.S.C. §§ 5934, 5534, \n5511(c)(2); providing “timely assistance to borrowers of private education loans,” \nincluding by handling borrower complaints, id. § 5535(a); providing resources to \nconsumers  to  improve  financial  literacy,  id.  § 5493;  furnishing  background \ninformation to the FBI to facilitate the mandatory registration of loan originators, id. \n§ 5106; and publishing semi-annually “credit card price and availability information” \nand credit-card agreements, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1632, 1646(b). No statute or delegation of \nauthority purports to give the Acting Director or CFPB the power to dissolve CFPB. \n \n  28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 31 of 41\nSecond, the defendants’ suspension of the CFPB is contrary to law. “[A]gency \naction is ‘not in accordance with law’ if it violates some extant federal statute or \nregulation.” Ovintiv USA, Inc. v. Haaland, 665 F. Supp. 3d 59, 72 (D.D.C. 2023). Here, \ndefendants’ actions directing and resulting the CFPB in ceasing work are contrary to \nthe CFPB’s specific statutory mandates to perform various activities and is contrary \nto Congress’s establishment of the CFPB in the first instance. See 12 U.S.C. § 5491(a).  \nThe defendants’ actions are also contrary to law because the agency has not \nfollowed applicable regulations governing its employment decisions. Civil servants \nare entitled to 60-days notice before being subject to a reduction in force. See 5 C.F.R. \n§§  351.202,  351.805(a).  That  has  not  occurred  here.  Likewise,  when  “approving \nspecific incidents of administrative leave” not already authorized in agency policies. \nSee 5 C.F.R. § 630.1403(a)(6). There is no agency policy that permits putting the \nentire Bureau on administrative leave, and Vought did not consider those factors.  \nThird, the defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious. The APA’s \nprohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action requires agencies “to examine \nall relevant factors and record evidence, and to articulate a reasoned explanation for \n[their] decision[s].” Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 923 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017); see also Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 \nU.S. 1, 16 (2020) (stating that the APA “requires agencies to engage in ‘reasoned \ndecisionmaking’” (quoting Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015)). To do so, “the \nagency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for \nits action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice \n \n  29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 32 of 41\nmade.’” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, \n168 (1962)). Agency action fails to satisfy this standard if the agency “failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem, id., or if it “offer[s] an explanation for \nits decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,” Am. Wild Horse \nPres. Campaign, 873 F.3d at 923. When reviewing agency action, a court “may not \nsupply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc., 463 U.S. at 43.  \nHere, the CFPB has provided no reasoned explanation at all for its decision to \nstop all work and deprive the public of the services that Congress mandated. That is \na sufficient basis to deem its action arbitrary and capricious. Vought’s statements \nthat he is “committed to implementing the President’s policies” are not a reasoned \nexplanation for the decision to shut down a congressionally-mandated agency.23 What \nlittle else Vought has said publicly betrays either a shocking lack of knowledge of the \nagency’s functions or willful misleading of the public. He has declared the CFPB \n“unaccountab[le]” even though, as his presence (and Chopra’s firing) demonstrates, \nthe agency’s head is as accountable to the President as any other. 24 He has reposted \non X the false assertion that the CFPB is “NOT a Wall Street regulator,” but a “Main \nStreet regulator,”25 even though the CFPB is specifically charged with supervisory \n \n23https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/cfpb-vought-staff-finance-\nwatchdog.html  \n24 https://x.com/russvought/status/1888423503537360986. \n25 https://x.com/MarkCalabria/status/1888624162626789388. \n \n  30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 33 of 41\nauthority over financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. 12 U.S.C. § \n5515. And he has declared that the agency has weaponized itself “against disfavored \nindustries,”26  even  though  Congress  has  chosen  the  industries  that  the  CFPB \noversees. To the extent any of this was meant to justify the gutting of the CFPB, it is \nall “counter to the evidence.” Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign, 873 F.3d at 923. \nMoreover, Vought’s action cannot be justified by reference to President Trump’s \nassertion that there he wants to get rid of “waste, fraud, and abuse.” There is no \nevidence that the entire Ombudsman’s office or Consumer Response unit is waste, \nfraud, and abuse or that every employee fired, placed on administrative leave, or now \nfacing imminent termination was engaged in waste, fraud, and abuse.  Indeed, the \ndefendants have done nothing to substantiate their claims of waste, fraud, and abuse. \nAnd they have not weighed all the relevant factors or explained why the action taken \nhere—closing down statutorily mandated functions of the Bureau—is an appropriate \nresponse to that wrongdoing.  \nIn short, the defendants’ attempt to unilaterally eliminate an agency created \nby Congress through a duly enacted statute has no antecedent in our nation’s history \nand  constitutional  tradition—and  for  good  reason.  It  flagrantly  violates  the \nConstitution’s separation of powers, contravenes the Appointments Clause, and runs \nafoul of basic principles of administrative law. The plaintiffs aren’t just likely but \noverwhelmingly likely to succeed in establishing that the defendants' actions are \nunlawful and should be enjoined. \n \n26 https://x.com/russvought/status/1888625239703110013. \n \n  31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 34 of 41\nII.  The plaintiffs will suffer immediate, irreparable injury if the CFPB \nshutdown continues.   \n  “An irreparable harm is an imminent injury that is both great and certain to \noccur, and for which legal remedies are inadequate.” Beattie v. Barnhart, 663 F. Supp. \n2d 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2009). The plaintiffs here have made that showing. By freezing the \nCFPB’s  work,  the  defendants  have  put  an  immediate  halt  to  the  Bureau’s \nperformance of its statutory functions. Each of the consumer plaintiffs rely on the \nBureau’s performance of those functions and are certain to be seriously harmed by \ntheir stoppage—indeed, they already have. And the harm to employees—and the \norganizations that represent them—caused by the defendants’ use of mass firings to \neffectuate their goal of dismantling the agency is self-evident.  \nNational Treasury Employees Union and the Employee Association. The \n“circumstances surrounding” the mass firing that is underway “so far depart from the \nnormal situation” that, “together with the resultant effect [of the defendants’ conduct] \non the employee[s],” the Union and Employee Association will suffer irreparable \ninjury absent an injunction. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974). Take it \nfrom Mr. Vought himself, who promised to put federal workers “in trauma.”27 That’s \nexactly what will happen if the layoffs are permitted to go through.

Current employees can’t avail \nthemselves of the CFPB’s internal harassment policies, and employees who filed \ncomplaints under those policies in the days before the stop-work order have not been \nallowed to proceed. Id. ¶ 13. And all employees—current and those who have already \nbeen fired—fear that their personal information will be leaked to the public, leading \nto harassment. Id. ¶ 6. The Bureau is even helping to facilitate that harassment by \ncreating “a Twitter account urging companies to report CFPB employees.” Id. ¶ 14. \nThat mechanism is ripe for “retaliation” against employees “for having previously \ndone their job of supervision or enforcement.” Id. The way the CFPB has been closed \n \n  33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 36 of 41\ndown is, in other words, no normal employment action—the defendants’ treatment of \nthe Bureau’s employees “so far depart[s] from the norm[]” that it is sure to inflict \nirreparable harm if not enjoined. Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68.  \nPastor Steege. Paster Steege has already suffered harm from the Bureau’s \nclosure—her meeting with the CFPB was cancelled and she is in “extreme distress” \nabout “[t]he uncertainty surrounding [her] financial future.” Steege Decl. ¶¶ 7–8. But \nthe harm that lies ahead should the CFPB’s shutdown continue is perhaps even more \nprofound. Pastor Steege is in hospice and has been told she has no more than six \nmonths left to live. Id. ¶ 1. Unless this Court intervenes, she will spend the final six \nmonths of her life in that state of “extreme distress,” and without the “dignity and \npeace of mind” that the loan forgiveness would have delivered to her. Id. ¶ 8. To \nsubject Pastor Steege to that indignity in the final months of her life is to inflict \nirreparable harm. See, e.g., Obergefell v. Kasich, 2013 WL 3814262, at *7 (S.D. Ohio \n2013). \nSo too is the harm that is certain to come after she dies. Without the CFPB’s \nassistance,  Pastor  Steege  will  die  with  student  loan  debt  that  will  become  her \nsurviving family’s burden to bear. Steege Decl. ¶ 9. And she will not be able to leave \nthem the $15,000 of overpayments she may well be entitled to recoup and which they \nwould use for their basic needs after they pass. Id. ¶¶ 4, 9. Instead, her surviving \nfamily would be left to seek a death discharge, without recourse for the $15,000. Id. \nThat Pastor Steege’s survivors will be unable to recover money that Pastor Steege \nwould leave to them but-for the defendants’ unlawful actions is further irreparable \n \n  34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 37 of 41\nharm that only preliminary relief can prevent. See Holiday CVS, L.L.C. v. Holder, \n2012 WL  10973832,  at  *2  (D.D.C.  2012)  (“[P]laintiffs’  losses  will  be  sufficiently \nirrecoverable,  certain,  and  great  to  warrant  the  required  finding  of  irreparable \nharm.”). \nNAACP. The stop-work order has left members of the NAACP who were \nvictims of the Los Angeles fires that destroyed much of the city vulnerable to financial \nfraud and unable to secure financial assistance available to fire victims. Bross Decl. \n¶¶ 3–4. In the aftermath of the fires, financial scammers sought to exploit NAACP \nmembers. Id. ¶¶ 2–3. To serve its members facing this threat, the NAACP reached \nout to the CFPB’s Natural Disaster Team. Id. ¶ 3. The Natural Disaster Team quickly \nprovided  assistance—educating  NAACP  members  about  the  risks  of  post-fire \nfinancial fraud and connecting them with in-state resources. Id. The Team also \ncommitted to provide additional educational materials and to send a CFPB staffer to \nLos Angeles to help hundreds of fire victims in person. Id.  \nBut the Team never provided the additional resources and the staffer did not \nshow  up  because  of  the  stop-work  order—leaving  NAACP  members  already \ndevastated from the fires to secure mortgage forbearance on their own and fend off \nscammers without much need resources. Id. Without the CFPB’s assistance securing \nforbearance, many members’ mortgage companies have refused forbearance or tack \non illegitimate fees—and the members continue to deal with the fallout. Id. ¶ 4. \nThe shuttering of the CFPB has injured the NAACP and its members in a \nsecond way. Prior to the shutdown, the NAACP had collaborated with the CFPB to \n \n  35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 38 of 41\neducate its members—part of the NAACP broader effort to protect its members, \nparticularly older ones vulnerable to financial fraud, from economic harms. Id. ¶ 6. \nThe NAACP and CFPB had a meeting about a plan for a state-by-state approach to \nhelp members across the country as recently as last month and held multiple joint \neducation events in 2024, with former director Chopra appearing at one event. Id. \nThat work was supposed to continue this year, but because of the shutdown, the \nNAACP is left without the CFPB’s assistance in pursuing this project of educating its \nmembers. Id. This, too, is irreparable harm. See Drs. for Am. v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., \n2025 WL 452707, at *9 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025) (granting temporary restraining order \nbased on wrongful deprivation of information).      \nVirginia Poverty Law Center. The Virginia Poverty Law Center will no \nlonger be able to serve its clients in the same ways if the shutdown continues and \nConsumer  Response  remains  non-functional.  The  Center  relies  on  Consumer \nResponse to assist consumers who call its predatory lending hotline—a central part \nof its work—in an efficient and effective way. Speer Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12–14. It knows from \nexperience that providing assistance without utilizing Consumer Response consumes \nsubstantially more resources. Speer Decl. ¶¶ 15–16, 24. Having to return to that work \nwould prevent the Center from serving its other clients and do the outreach work that \nis equally important to the Center’s ability to serve its community. Speer Decl. ¶ 24; \nsee, e.g., League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. \n2016)  (defendant's  actions  “unquestionably  make  it  more  difficult  for  the” \n \n  36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 39 of 41\norganizations “to accomplish their primary mission,” which “provide[s] injury for \npurposes both of standing and irreparable harm”). \nNational Consumer Law Center. The National Consumer Law Center will \nalso be irreparably injured if Consumer Response remains shut down. NCLC is a non-\nprofit dedicated to “help[ing] financially stressed families build and retain wealth, \nand advance economic fairness.” Dubois Decl. ¶¶ 2–3. A central way in which it does \nso is by researching, writing, and publishing on matters that affect low-income \nconsumers.  Id.  The  CFPB’s  consumer  database—which  is  a  collection  of  the \ncomplaints  filed  and  responses  given  and  that  Congress  has  required  to  be \nmaintained and publicly available, 12 U.S.C. §§ 5512(c)(3)(A); 5493(b)(1), (b)(3)(C), \n(c)(2)(D); 5535(d)—is critical to that work. Dubois Decl. ¶¶ 12–13.  NCLC uses these \nmaterials (and other CFPB reports) to publish major white papers used by the large \nnetwork of consumer advocates that look to its expertise to guide their work. Id. It \nalso uses the database to form the substance of the presentations and seminars it \nconducts. Id. Without this resource, NCLC will be incapable of providing the same \ninformation to the advocates and consumers it supports—undermining a central \naspect of its mission and work. See Action All. of Senior Citizens of Greater Phila. v. \nHeckler, 789 F.2d 931, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (organization suffered cognizable injury \nwhen government cut off “generous flow of information” on which it relied); Drs. for \nAm. v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 2025 WL 452707, at *9 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025).      \nIII.  The balance of equities favors the plaintiffs.  \n“[W]hen the Government is the opposing party” the final two factors—the \nbalance of equities and the public interest—“merge.” Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. \n \n  37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 40 of 41\nFEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016). The question, then, is whether the harm to \nthe plaintiffs if the Court does not issue an injunction outweighs the harm to the \ngovernment if the Court does. See id. The balance weighs heavily in the plaintiffs’ \nfavor.   \n  Consider what happens absent emergency relief. Hundreds of employees may \nlose their jobs; their families will lose that income and needed health insurance. See \nKaspar Decl. ¶¶ 2, 16–23. Hundreds of thousands of consumers will be left without \naccess to the CFPB’s complaints’ system—leaving them vulnerable to foreclosure, \nwrongfully denied credit, unable to secure college transcripts to look for work; simply \nlosing money that they do not owe; and in Pastor Seege’s case, leaving behind a debt \nburden on her family. Members of congress like Senator Blumenthal and entities like \nthe Virginia Poverty Law Center will be unable to serve their constituencies and \ncommunities  in  the  same  efficient  and  effective  ways,  stretching  their  limited \nresources to the detriment of the people they serve. Blumenthal Decl. ¶ 13; Speer \nDecl. ¶ 24. The people the NAACP serves will be left without critical resources as \nthey strive to recover. And the large number of consumers and consumer advocates \nthat NCLC supports will be worse off.  \nOn  the  other  side  of  the  ledger,  the  risk  of  harm  to  the  government  is \ninsignificant. “It is well established that the Government cannot suffer harm from an \ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d \n174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020). And there is “no public interest in the perpetuation of \n \n  38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/14/25     Page 41 of 41\nunlawful agency action.” Open Cmtys. All. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. \n2017). The equities therefore tilt heavily in the plaintiffs’ favor.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant a limited administrative \nshow, grant the motion for a temporary restraining order, or in the alternative, grant \na preliminary injunction. \nDated: February 13, 2025    Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n/s/ Deepak Gupta   /s/ Wendy Liu                            \nDeepak Gupta (DC Bar No. 495451)  Wendy Liu (DC Bar No. 1600942) \nRobert Friedman (D.C.

As alleged in the amended complaint and \ndemonstrated  in  the  forthcoming  memorandum  of  law  in  support  of  this  motion  and \naccompanying  declarations,  the  CFPB  is  planning  mass—unconstitutional—ﬁrings  of  its \nworkforce. Earlier this week, more than 70 employees were ﬁred in indiscriminatory fashion after \nclose of business, and Defendant Vought has indicated that he plans to return CFPB’s operational \nfunding. The plaintiffs expect massive layoffs of CFPB staff, as soon as tonight—ﬁrst to term \nemployees and then categorically to employees across all of the CFPB’s statutorily required \nfunctions. In addition, defendants have issued an across-the-board stop-work order that has \nharmed and is continuing to harm scores of consumers and those who support them, including the \nplaintiffs here.  \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 10     Filed 02/13/25     Page 2 of 3\n  These unprecedented actions are illegal. Defendant Vought’s actions to shut down the \nCFPB are ultra vires because he is acting as CFPB Director despite not going through Senate \nconﬁrmation or being eligible for appointment under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and he \ntherefore lacks any lawful authority to carry out these actions. Additionally, Defendants have \nshuttered CFPB operations in direct deﬁance of statutory commands—violating both separation-\nof-powers principles and the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n  The plaintiffs accordingly request a limited administrative stay to prevent any action to \ncategorically ﬁre CFPB employees before the Court has a chance to assess the merits of this case. \nA mass layoff would work incalculable harm on employees, their families, the union of which they \nare members, and the American consumers who depend on their work. \nThe plaintiffs further request a temporary restraining order (1) enjoining Defendant Vought \nfrom taking any action to terminate the employment of CFPB staff; (2) requiring the agency to lift \nDefendant Vought’s directives to cease work at CFPB, including by restoring its statutorily \nmandated functions and reinstating any cancelled contracts; and (3) enjoining Defendants from \ntaking any further action to suspend the operations of the CFPB.  \n  As required by Local Civil Rule 65.1(a), at 5:55 p.m. on February 13, 2025, counsel for the \nplaintiffs emailed the Chief of the Civil Division for the United States Attorney’s Ofﬁce for the \nDistrict of Columbia, three Assistant Directors for the Federal Programs Branch of the Department \nof Justice, and three assigned attorneys in the Federal Programs Branch of the Department of \nJustice to provide actual notice that the plaintiffs would be ﬁling this motion for a temporary \nrestraining order. The plaintiffs attached to that email electronic copies of the First Amended \nComplaint, motion for temporary restraining order, and proposed orders before completing this \nelectronic ﬁling. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 10     Filed 02/13/25     Page 3 of 3\n  The plaintiffs will be ﬁling a memorandum in support and declarations in short order. They \nwill complete the same process for those materials and ﬁle a notice with the Court that actual notice \nhas been effectuated at the time of ﬁling.   \n \n \nDated: February 13, 2025    Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n/s/ Deepak Gupta   /s/ Wendy Liu                            \nDeepak Gupta (DC Bar No. 495451)  Wendy Liu (DC Bar No. 1600942) \nRobert Friedman (D.C.

The injunction contained multiple provisions, including provision (3), which \nprovided, \"Defendants shall not terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the \nindividual employee's performance or conduct; and defendants shall not issue any notice of \nreduction-in-force to any CFPB employee.\"  Id.   \n \nOn April 11, 2025, the Court of Appeals granted defendants' motion to stay the preliminary \ninjunction pending appeal in part and denying it in part. NTEU v. Vought, No. 25-5091 (D.C. Cir. \nApr. 11, 2025), Order [Dkt. # 2110720].  In granting the stay in part, it ordered, among other \nthings, that \"[p]rovision three (3) is stayed insofar as it prohibits defendants from terminating or \nissuing a notice of reduction in force to employees whom defendants have determined, after a \nparticularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants' statutory duties.\"  \nId.   \n \nIn the wake of that order, defendants promptly took steps to complete a reduction-in-force \naffecting 90% of the agency's employees, and on April 17, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion \nasking the Court to order defendants to show cause as to why they had not violated the preliminary \ninjunction as stayed in part by the D.C. Circuit. Pls.' Mot. [Dkt. # 105].  The motion was deemed \nto be a motion to enforce the injunction, and on April 18, this Court issued an interim order \nsuspending the RIF.  Order [Dkt. # 113].  See also Minute Order (Apr. 19, 2025) (granting \nplaintiffs' motion to clarify the April 18 Order).   \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 141     Filed 04/28/25     Page 2 of 2\nIn  their  opposition  to  the  motion  to  enforce,  defendants  asserted  that  \"[p]laintiffs' \narguments rest on fundamental misunderstandings of the D.C. Circuit's stay order.  Plaintiffs \nsuggest that the Court should conduct its own analysis of whether the RIF would interfere with the \nperformance of CFPB statutory duties. But the stay order plainly requires Defendants – not this \nCourt or Plaintiffs – to determine that employees subject to a RIF are unnecessary to the \nperformance of CFPB’s statutory duties.  And the agency's Chief Legal Officer submits that he \nand two other attorneys have made that determination. . . . \" Defs.’ Opp. [Dkt. # 121] at 2 (internal \ncitations omitted) (emphasis in original).  However, it was the defendants who misunderstood what \nthis Court was doing in response to plaintiffs' motion.  It simply scheduled a hearing and froze the \nsituation before employees were discharged and data was lost so that it could determine whether \nthe defendants in fact engaged in the particularized assessment that the Order requires.  And to \nmake that determination, there was nothing in the law or in the stay order that required the Court \nto take the agency's word for it, especially after evidence to the contrary had been proffered.   \nDefendants promptly appealed again.  \nThis afternoon, the Court of Appeals ordered, sua sponte, that its \"stay order be modified \nin part to lift the partial stay of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction.\"  NTEU v. Vought, \nNo. 25-5091 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, 2025), Order [Dkt. # 2113309] at 2.  This means that the March 28 \nban on any reduction-in-force has been reinstated as originally issued.  Under these circumstances, \nthe RIF enjoined by this Court on April 18 cannot go forward at all; the Court of Appeals has \nordered that \"paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction under review is now effective pending \nfurther order of this court.\"  Id.  Thus, in the Court's view, there is no need for the Court to \ndetermine whether the defendants complied with the terms of provision (3) as stayed in part. \n \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that:  plaintiffs' motion to enforce the preliminary injunction \n[Dkt. # 105] is denied without prejudice as moot; the hearings set for April 29 and 30, 2025 are \nhereby vacated; provision (3) and all of the other provisions of the preliminary injunction that were \nleft intact by the Circuit's Order of April 11 remain in force; the motion to compel the production \nof records [Dkt. # 134] will be held in abeyance until after the Court of Appeals rules on the \nvalidity of the preliminary injunction; and defendants' motion to stay proceedings pending final \nresolution of the appeal [Dkt. # 103] is granted insofar as the obligation to respond to the complaint \nis deferred. The Court will establish a schedule for further proceedings, as necessary, after the \nCourt of Appeals has ruled.  \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE: April 28, 2025 \n2 \n ",

Congress created the CFPB in response to a financial crisis \nand assigned the CFPB its critical mission of protecting the American consumer. \nThe efforts of Defendant Russell Vought, the CFPB’s Acting Director, to bring the \nCFPB’s statutorily prescribed work to a halt violate separation of powers principles.  \n   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 2 of 8\n \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nVENUE \n2.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).   \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff NTEU is an unincorporated association with its principal \nplace of business at 800 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001. NTEU is, \npursuant to Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, Public Law No. 95-454, 92 \nStat. 1111, the exclusive bargaining representative of employees in thirty-seven \nfederal departments and agencies, including the CFPB.  \n4.  Defendant Russell Vought is head of the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Acting Director of the CFPB.   \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \nI.  Congress’s Significant Power to Shape the Executive Branch \n \nA.  Congress’s Plenary Authority over the Existence, Mission, and \nFunding of Executive Agencies \n \n5.  The Framers intended for Congress to be the most powerful branch of \nthe federal government. The legislative power that the Founders envisioned \n“necessarily predominates” (The Federalist No. 51 (J. Madison)) and has a \n“tendency . . . to absorb every other” (The Federalist No. 71 (A. Hamilton)).  \n6.  Congress can create or destroy executive branch agencies and dictate \ntheir missions. “To Congress under its legislative power is given the establishment \nof offices … [and] the determination of their functions and jurisdiction.” Myers v. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 3 of 8\n \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52, 129 (1926). Accord Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138 \n(1976) (discussing Congress’s ability to create or remove federal agencies through \nthe Necessary & Proper Clause). Congress thus “control[s]” the very “existence of \nexecutive offices.” Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. \n477, 500 (2010). \nB.  Congress’s Creation of the CFPB to Protect the American Public \n \n7.  Congress created the CFPB after the great recession of 2007-08. \nCongress assigned the CFPB the mission of supporting and protecting American \nconsumers in the financial marketplace. To fulfill its statutory mission, CFPB \nmonitors financial markets for risks to consumers; enforces consumer finance law; \ninvestigates consumer complaints; and writes rules to protect consumers from \nunfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in the financial sector. Pub. L. 111–203 \n(2010). See https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/.  \n8.  The CFPB has supervisory authority over depository institutions with \n$10 billion or more in assets such as banks, thrifts, and credits unions; and over \nnon-depository entities such as mortgage originators and servicers, payday lenders, \nand private student lenders. CFPB also supervises consumer reporting, consumer \ndebt collection and foreclosure, student loan servicing, international money \ntransfer, and automobile financing. See \nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-\nexaminations/institutions/.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 4 of 8\n \n9.  The CFPB’s workforce has worked tirelessly to do the job that \nCongress assigned to it. As of December 2024, CFPB has obtained more than $21 \nbillion in monetary compensation, principal reductions, cancelled debts, and other \nconsumer relief as part of its enforcement and supervisory work. Through its \nenforcement activities, CFPB has collected approximately $363 million associated \nwith harm to American servicemembers and veterans. And CFPB has collected \nmore than $5 billion from companies and individuals that violated the law, which \nthe Bureau deposits into a victim relief fund. See \nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/.  \nII.  The Trump Administration’s Attempts to Dismantle the CFPB  \n \n10.  On February 7, 2025, Elon Musk “posted ‘CFPB RIP’ with a tombstone \nemoji on his social media site X [ ], raising the prospect that the consumer \nprotection agency could be the next U.S. Agency for International Development, \nwhich he has said should ‘die.’” Holly Otterbein and Katy O’Donnell, “‘CFPB RIP’: \nElon Musk is Already Descending on His Next Target,” Politico.com, \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/elon-musk-team-cfpb-00203119. \n11.  In a post on X on February 8, 2025, Defendant Vought “said he had \nnotified the Federal Reserve that the CFPB . . . will not take ‘its next draw of \nunappropriated funding,’ saying the funding ‘is not “reasonably necessary” to carry \nout its duties.’” Sarah Fortinsky, “Vought Seeks to Halt Action at CFPB,” The \nHill.com, https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5134732-cfpb-budget-russia-\nvought/. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 5 of 8\n \n12.  Defendant Vought has also directed the CFPB workforce “to ‘cease all \nsupervision and examination activity,’ ‘cease all stakeholder engagement,’ pause all \npending investigations, not issue any public communications and pause \n‘enforcement actions.’” Id.   \n13.  Defendant Vought has also ordered that “the agency’s Washington \nheadquarters [] be closed for the coming week.” Douglas Gillison, “Consumer \nProtection Agency CFPB Neutralized by Trump’s New Chief,” Reuters (Feb. 9, 2025) \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-acting-cfpb-chief-halts-all-supervision-\ncompanies-2025-02-09/. \n14.  CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have \nbeen directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any \nauthorized type of leave. \n15.  It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to \na purge of CFPB’s workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency’s \nstatutory mission. \nIII.   The Effect of Defendant’s Attempt to Dismantle the CFPB on NTEU and \nIts Members  \n16.  NTEU brings this action in its associational capacity on behalf of its \nNTEU members at the CFPB, as well as in its institutional capacity on behalf of \nitself.   \n17.  NTEU members at the CFPB are no longer able to do the supervision \nand enforcement work that they came to the CFPB to do for the American people. \nNTEU members at the CFPB are employed in a variety of professions. NTEU \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 6 of 8\n \nmembers Jasmine Hardy and Nelle Rohlich are employed as an Examiner and \nEnforcement Attorney, respectively. Because of Defendant Vought’s directive, \nNTEU members like Ms. Hardy and Ms. Rohlich cannot perform their duties \nexamining financial institutions, investigating financial institutions, and initiating \nenforcement actions. Because Defendant Vought is preventing them and other \nNTEU members from doing their work for the CFPB and refusing to take the \nCFPB’s next draw of funding, it is substantially likely that they will lose their jobs \nand suffer financial harm. \n18.  Because of Defendant Vought’s directive and his shuttering of the \nBureau’s headquarters for at least a week, CFPB employees are apprehensive about \ntheir employment and their futures.   \n19.  NTEU also brings this action in its institutional capacity. There is a \nsubstantial likelihood of reductions to the CFPB workforce because Defendant \nVought is preventing employees from doing their statutorily mandated work and \nrefusing to use additional funds that are available to the CFPB. Those reductions in \nthe CFPB’s workforce will very likely include NTEU’s members and, in turn, \ndecrease NTEU’s dues revenue from its members at the CFPB. Even if these \nindividuals remain NTEU members as former federal employees after they are \nfired, NTEU will lose money because their dues rates will be significantly reduced. \n20.  NTEU is expending significant time and resources responding to the \nmany concerns that its CFPB members are raising about their future and the future \nof the Bureau.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 7 of 8\n \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nCount I:  The Executive Branch’s actions to dismantle CFPB violate separation of \npowers principles.  \n21.  Plaintiff reasserts the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through \n20 of this complaint as though contained herein.  \n22.  Congress created the CFPB and assigned it a critical portfolio.   \n23.  Defendant Vought’s decision to prevent the CFPB from drawing down \nmore funding and ordering the CFPB’s workforce to cease all supervision and \nexamination activity reflects an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress’s decision to \ncreate the CFPB to protect American consumers.   \n24.  Defendant Vought’s actions thus violate separation of powers \nprinciples because they undermine Congress’s authority to set and fund the \nmissions of the CFPB.   \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiff requests judgment against Defendant Vought:  \nA.  Declaring that Defendant Vought’s directive to the CFPB’s employees \nto stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful;  \nB.  Enjoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB’s \nsupervision and enforcement work; \nC.  Ordering Defendant Vought to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and \ncosts; and \nD.  Ordering such other and further relief as the Court deems just and \nproper.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381     Document 1     Filed 02/09/25     Page 8 of 8\n \n    Respectfully submitted, \n      /s/ Julie M.

The States agree that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims but \nleave that argument to the parties. This brief is submitted to explain that, while States’ roles in \nconsumer protection and financial regulation are robust and diverse, there are several forms of \nirreparable harm that many States and state residents will suffer as a result of defendants’ actions \nif relief is not granted.  \nFirst, CFPB has long been providing statutorily mandated services that benefit the States’ \nresidents and support for the States’ own enforcement efforts. Second, States have benefited from \nthe CFPB’s supervision of compliance with consumer-protection laws by very large banks. Third, \nmany States have benefited as well as from the CFPB’s collaboration in a number of areas of joint \nsupervision and enforcement. The sudden withdrawal of these CFPB services, supervision and \ncollaborative assistance will thus inflict immediate harm on States and their residents.  \nIndeed, these harms have already begun. In the absence of a functioning CFPB, States have \nsuddenly lost the CFPB’s significant expertise and resources that can be invaluable in ongoing \nmatters that protect their residents. States’ access to the benefits provided by the CFPB has \neffectively ceased. Referrals of consumer complaints to the CFPB have been left in limbo. States \nthat have collaborative enforcement investigations or active litigations pending, or that have \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 9 of 26\n \npreviously  established  schedules  for  joint  supervisory  examinations,  have  been  unable  to \ncommunicate directly with their CFPB counterparts. And direct inquiries to the CFPB by States \nhave gone unanswered. The Court should grant plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nBACKGROUND \nI.  FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION, CONGRESS CREATED THE CFPB \nTO FILL SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION \nIn 2008, the United States experienced the most severe financial recession since the Great \nDepression. The Great Recession, as it has come to be known, “nearly crippled the U.S. economy,” \nS. Rep. No. 111-176, at 2 (2010), causing millions of Americans to lose their jobs, homes, and \nsavings, id. at 9. While the underlying causes were complex, there is little debate that abusive \nsubprime mortgage lending and the associated collapse of the real-estate market played a central \nrole.1 And Congress, in examining the fallout, concluded that the Great Recession resulted from \n“the failure of the federal banking and other regulators to address significant consumer protection \nissues detrimental to both consumers and the safety and soundness of the banking system.” Id. \nInstead, the  multitude of  federal  regulators  were  beset  by  “conflicting  regulatory  missions, \nfragmentation, and regulatory arbitrage.” Id. at 10. \nIn direct response to these events, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n203, 124 Stat. 1955. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Consumer Financial Protection \nAct (CFPA), which created the CFPB. The CFPA reflects four main innovations: \n•  Consolidation of authority within one federal regulator: To address the then-diffuse \nresponsibility  for  enforcement  of  federal  consumer  protections  by  federal \nregulators, Congress transferred to the CFPB certain consumer-protection functions \nfrom existing federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and National \n \n1 See generally Fin. Crisis Inquiry Comm., Final Report of the National Commission on the \nCauses of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States at 67–80 (2011) (For sources \navailable on the internet, full URLs appear in the table of authorities). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 10 of 26\n \nCredit Union Administration. See 12 U.S.C. § 5581; CFPB v. Community Fin. \nServs. Ass’n of Am., Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 421–22 (2024) (CFSAA). \n•  Prohibition of “abusive” practices: Congress provided the CFPB, for the first time \nfor any federal regulator, the power to prohibit “abusive” acts and practices, i.e., \nthose that unreasonably take advantage of consumers, in addition to unfair and \ndeceptive  practices.  12  U.S.C.  § 5531(a);  S.  Rep.  No.  111-176,  at  172.  But \nCongress did not give States authority to target the abusive-practices provisions of \nthe CFPA against national banks. See 12 U.S.C. § 5552(a)(2). \n•  Supervision of very large banks: Congress granted the CFPB “exclusive authority” \nto  supervise  compliance  with  federal  consumer  financial  laws  through \nexaminations of “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions (i.e., \nthose federal- or state-chartered banks with at least $10 billion in assets). Id. § 5515. \n•  Authority over non-depository institutions: Congress granted the CFPB authority \nto regulate payday lenders, private education lenders, nonbank mortgage lenders, \nand other large participants in markets for consumer financial products. Id. § 5514. \nThe CFPA additionally sets forth the CFPB’s other “primary functions” as: (i) “conducting finan-\ncial education programs”; (ii) “collecting, investigating, and responding to consumer complaints”; \n(iii) analyzing data and other information “to identify risks to consumers” and to ensure that \nconsumer financial markets function; (iv) enforcing federal consumer-protection laws; (v) “issuing \nrules,  orders,  and  guidance  implementing”  those  laws;  and  (vi)  performing  other  “support \nactivities.” 12 U.S.C. § 5511(c). While the CFPB has exclusive authority to enforce against \nnational banks the provisions of the CFPA itself—including its prohibition against abusive \npractices, id. § 5552(a)(2)(A), States maintain authority to enforce regulations issued under the \nCFPA, as well as other consumer financial laws, against both state and national banks, id. \n§ 5552(a)(1), (a)(2)(B). See generally Cuomo v. Clearing House Ass’n, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519 \n(2009). \nTo achieve its goals, Congress set forth a host of additional specific statutory mandates, \nincluding that the CFPB “shall publish” annual reports on its monitoring of “risks to consumers,” \n12 U.S.C. § 5512(c)(1)–(3); that it “shall establish” procedures “to provide a timely response to \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 11 of 26\n \nconsumers” regarding “complaints against, or inquiries concerning” activity in consumer financial \nmarkets, id. § 5534(a); and that, to minimize regulatory burden, it “shall” coordinate designated \nsupervisory activities with the relevant state and federal agencies, id. § 5514(b)(3).  \nII.  IN FULFILLING ITS MANDATE, THE CFPB HAS PARTNERED WITH THE \nSTATES AND COMPLEMENTED THEIR CONSUMER-PROTECTION WORK \nWhile Congress granted to the CFPB certain exclusive and mandatory functions, Congress \nalso intended the CFPB to partner with States to achieve general efficiencies and to complement \nwork traditionally done by States in the areas of consumer protection and financial regulation. For \nexample, the CFPA mandates that the CFPB coordinate with state regulators its examinations of \ncertain large banks and nonbank entities, a mandate the CFPB has interpreted to a require that it \nshare information with state regulators.2 12 U.S.C. §§ 5514(b)(3); 5515(b)(2). Congress also \ncodified the authority of state attorneys general to enforce various federal consumer financial laws, \nid. § 5552(a), thereby enabling cooperative state and federal enforcement as well as independent \nstate enforcement, see Pennsylvania v. Navient Corp., 967 F.3d 273, 286 (3d Cir. 2020). \nIn practice, the States’ work in coordination with the CFPB reflects the diversity of the \nStates themselves, and as a whole has spanned the breadth of the agency’s functions: \nConsumer-complaint portal. The CFPB has maintained a statutorily mandated system for \nfielding and responding to consumer complaints regarding the whole gamut of consumer financial \nproducts. See 12 U.S.C. § 5534. States have referred residents to the CFPB’s consumer-complaint \nsystem for a variety of reasons, including when the CFPB has a track record for being able to \nquickly  connect  consumers  with  relevant  providers  (such  as  education  lenders,  mortgage \noriginators, or servicing companies). States have also relied on the CFPB’s consumer-complaint \n \n2 CFPB, CFPB State of Intent for Sharing Information With State Banking and Financial \nServices Regulators (Dec. 6, 2012). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 12 of 26\n \nportal to support investigations of specific providers, to spot and monitor trends in their States, and \nto explore opportunities for coordinated enforcement among States. \nBank examination. States have partnered with the CFPB for purposes of examining state-\nchartered large banks and nonbank entities, over which both States and the CFPB have supervisory \nauthority.  For  example,  California  has  coordinated  with  CFPB  its  examinations  of  large \ninstitutions such as East West Bank, Cathay Bank, and Rocket Mortgage. In North Carolina, First \nCitizens Bank & Trust, Live Oak Banking Company of Wilmington, First Bank of Southern Pines, \nTruist Bank, and the North Carolina State Employees Credit Union fall within the concurrent \njurisdiction of CFPB and state banking regulators. Colorado has worked with the CFPB to conduct \njoint  examinations  of  student-loan  servicers.  And  the  CFPB  has  worked  directly  with  the \nConference  of  State  Bank  Supervisors  through  a  “coordination  framework”3  that  facilitates \ncoordination with interested States of supervisory examinations of large nonbank entities—such \nas  nonbank  mortgage  originators,  automobile-financing  companies,  debt  collectors,  payday \nlenders, and money transmitters—that are jointly regulated by federal and state laws.  \nLaw enforcement. The CFPB has also partnered with States to stop deceptive, unfair, and \nabusive conduct. For example, in the past few years alone, the CFPB worked with New York to \nstop  improper  debt  collection,  CFPB  v.  JPL  Recover  Solutions,  LLC,  No.  20-cv-01217 \n(W.D.N.Y.), inaccurate and misleading remittance transfers, CFPB v. MoneyGram Int’l Inc., No. \n22-cv-03256 (S.D.N.Y.), and harmful subprime auto lending, CFPB v. Credit Acceptance Corp., \nNo. 23-cv-00038 (S.D.N.Y.). The CFPB also partnered with New York and six other States to shut \ndown an illegal debt-relief scheme. CFPB v. StratFS, LLC, No. 24-cv-00040 (W.D.N.Y.). And the \nCFPB worked with all 50 States to successfully enforce consumer-protection laws against a large \n \n3 2013 CFPB-State Supervisory Coordination Framework (May 7, 2013). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 13 of 26\n \nmortgage servicer, CFPB v. NationStar Mortg. LLC, No. 20-cv-03550 (D.D.C.); with a coalition \nof States to stop the unlawful brokerage of contracts offering high-interest credit to consumers, \nprimarily disabled veterans, CFPB v. Kern-Fuller, No. 20-cv-00786 (D.S.C.); and with Maryland \nto obtain a series of consent orders in connection with a scheme to exchange marketing services \nfor  referrals  of  settlement-service  business  in  connection  with  consumers’  home-mortgage \ntransactions, in violation of federal law.4  \nThe CFPB has also routinely collaborated with States on actions seeking to root out frauds, \nincluding frauds targeting student borrowers. The CFPB’s involvement has been instrumental to \nthe success of these and other actions, and thus to ensuring that state residents are protected in the \nmarketplace and, when harmed, receive the redress that Congress intended. For example, the CFPB \nand several States sued the nation’s then-largest student-loan servicer for deceiving borrowers by, \namong, other things, steering them into costly repayment options. CFPB v. Navient Corp., No. 17-\ncv-00101 (M.D. Pa.); Illinois v. Navient Corp., No. 17 CH 00761 (Ill. Ch. Div.); Grewal v. Navient \nCorp., No. ESX-C-172-2020 (N.J. Sup. Ct.). With the CFPB’s support, the multistate coalition \nobtained $1.85 billion in student debt relief and consumer restitution.5 The CFPB likewise \npartnered with 47 States and the District of Columbia in an action against a for-profit school and \nits affiliates for knowingly making high-cost loans to students that would be unable to repay; that \n \n4 CFPB v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 15-cv-00179 (D. Md.); Consent Order, In re Wells \nFargo Bank, N.A., No. 2015-CFPB-0002 (Jan. 22, 2015); Consent Order, In re JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A., No. 2015-CFPB-0001 (Jan. 22, 2015); CFPB v. Genuine Title, LLC, No. 15-cv-01235 \n(D. Md.). \n5  Navient  Multi-State  Settlement,  39  State  Attorneys  General  Announce  $1.85  Billion \nSettlement With Student Loan Servicer Navient (August 17, 2023). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 14 of 26\n \npartnership resulted in $500 million in debt forgiveness for tens of thousands of students.6 CFPB \nv. ITT Educ. Servs., Inc., No. 14-cv-00292 (S.D. Ind.). And the CFPB partnered with Minnesota, \nNorth Carolina, and California to shut down an illegal student-loan debt-relief scheme, recovering \n$95 million in consumer restitution.7 CFPB v. Consumer Advocacy Ctr., Inc., No. 19-cv-01998 \n(C.D. Cal.). \nIn sum, the CFPB has, to date, been an invaluable partner to many States in performing a \nvariety  of  consumer-protection  functions  mandated  by  Congress.  Defendants’  actions  to \neffectively shutter the CFPB go well beyond the normal shift in enforcement priorities that \naccompanies any change in presidential administration—they amount to a total dereliction of all \nmandatory statutory duties. As explained in greater detail below, the States will be irreparably \nharmed as a result of these actions. \nARGUMENT \nTHE SHUTTERING OF THE CFPB WILL CAUSE STATES IRREPARABLE HARM \nA.  The Absence of Statutorily Mandated Services Provided by the CFPB Will \nHarm Consumers’ Wellbeing and States’ Own Enforcement Efforts. \nAs a result of defendants’ actions, the States and their residents face a significant risk of \nirreparable harm, and they will continue to face that risk as long as the CFPB remains effectively \nout of commission. One of the most significant sources of that risk is the loss of the CFPB’s \nstatutorily mandated consumer-complaint system, which fields approximately 25,000 consumer \n \n6 CFPB, Consumer Financial Protection CFPB and Multiple States Enter Into Settlement with \nOwner of ITT Private Loans for Substantially Assisting ITT in Unfair Practices (September 15, \n2020). \n7 CFPB, CFPB to Issue $95 Million in Redress to Consumers Harmed by Premier Student \nLoan Center (Dec. 13, 2022).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 15 of 26\n \ncomplaints about financial products and services each week.8 Among other tasks, the CFPB’s \nintake process identifies and prioritizes complaints received in which a consumer asserts an \nimminent home foreclosure and then refers such consumers to local counselors to assist in \nresolving disputes.9 Although some States have similar mechanisms in place, those mechanisms \nby themselves cannot replace overnight the CFPB’s vast nationwide complaint intake system. In \nthe CFPB’s absence, consumers will be left without critical resources. In some States, this includes \nthe risk of foreclosure, a prototypical form of irreparable harm. See Jeffries v. Herr, No. 24-cv-\n01455, 2024 WL 2977882, at *2 n.3 (D. Md. June 13, 2024). This is particularly true given the \nrise of nonbank mortgage lenders that operate in multiple States, such as Rocket Mortgage,10 for \nwhich the CFPB is the only federal regulator with supervisory authority. 12 U.S.C. § 5514. \nThe number of such consumers who will face that risk is substantial. New York and New \nJersey each refer hundreds of consumer complaints to the CFPB every year. Maryland has referred \n900 complaints to the CFPB since January 1, 2020; California has referred nearly 4,000 complaints \nsince 2022; Colorado has referred more than 3,800 complaints in the last two years. And Minnesota \nhas secured redress for consumers on multiple occasions with the CFPB’s assistance, including for \na consumer who obtained corrections to credit reports, resulting in a credit-score increase of more \nthan 150 points; a consumer who resolved several thousand dollars of disputed bank deposits; and \na consumer who obtained relief from a cryptocurrency scam. And California has partnered with \nthe  CFPB’s  Office  of  Servicemember  Affairs  to  provide  outreach  and  training  on  military \ninstallations. \n \n8 CFPB, Submit a Complaint About a Financial Product or Service (last visited Feb. 21, 2025). \n9 CFPB, How to Avoid Foreclosure (last visited Feb. 21, 2025). \n10 Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Nonbank Mortgage Regulation (May 10, 2024). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 16 of 26\n \nThe States also regularly utilize data that the CFPB is required to collect pursuant to the \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for insight into trends in mortgage-lending products, \nlike the decline of refinancing and rise in closing costs.11 See 12 U.S.C. §§ 2803, 2809. The HMDA \ndata that has been collected and maintained by CFPB constitutes the single largest loan-level data \nset for mortgage lending across the country. Without this data, States will suddenly find themselves \nsignificantly hampered in their ability to monitor nationwide mortgage-foreclosure trends, trends \non which they rely to proactively address troubling developments in housing markets. \nThe CFPB’s absence also leaves the Civil Penalty Fund inactive. A person or entity against \nwhom the CFPB has taken legal action may be required to pay money into the agency’s Civil \nPenalty Fund, which Congress directed to be established. See 12 U.S.C. § 5497(d)(2). The CFPB, \nafter determining that victims will not receive compensation from the wrongdoers or any other \nsource of restitution, 12 C.F.R. §§ 1075.103, 1075.104, is authorized to distribute compensation \nto such victims from the Civil Penalty Fund. \nAs of this filing, there were more than a dozen matters for which distributions from the \nCivil Penalty Fund remained outstanding—i.e., cases in which consumers have already been found \nto be entitled to relief.12 If the Civil Penalty Fund remains inactive, thousands of state residents \nwill be deprived of awarded monetary relief planned to be distributed from the Fund. For example, \nthe CFPB sued an entity called Access Funding, alleging that it deprived consumers of significant \nportions of structured settlements; the lawsuit resulted in stipulated judgments.13 The CFPB’s \nclaims process for affected consumers closed on January 10, 2025,14 but no payments have yet \n \n11 CFPB, Mortgage Data (HMDA) (last visited Feb. 21, 2025). \n12 CFPB, Payments to Harmed Consumers by Case (last visited Feb. 21, 2025). \n13 CFPB, CFPB v.

And in another case, the CFPB brought an administrative \nenforcement action against a company called Tempoe that was found to have deceptively leased \nconsumer goods to consumers who believed they were purchasing the goods; distribution of more \nthan $192 million to the victims of this scheme only began this past October but has now abruptly \nstopped.17 \nThe ongoing imposition of these financial losses warrants injunctive relief.

State-Chartered Banks Will Be Unfairly Disadvantaged by the CFPB’s \nAbdication of Its Supervisory Duty Over Very Large Banks. \nAs Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, recently acknowledged in his testimony \nto Congress, in light of the CFPB’s dormancy, there is no federal regulator that is currently \nexamining very large banks, such as JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, for their compliance with \n \n15 CFPB, CFPB v.

The very large financial \ninstitutions that compete with state-chartered banks will have carte blanche to loosen their \nregulatory compliance and profit accordingly—to the detriment of consumers—as was seen in the \nyears leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, state-chartered banks will remain subject \nto state supervision for their compliance with the same laws.  \nConsistent supervision serves to maintain a healthy dual banking system19 by reducing the \nregulatory arbitrage that results in a race to the bottom. Material differences in the relative burden \nposed by different regulators incentivizes banks to game the system, which harms everyday \nconsumers.20 And such gaming is not merely theoretical: arbitrage and the introduction of risky \nproducts by financial institutions loosely supervised for consumer protection contributed to the \nGreat Recession, and Congress crafted the CFPB’s mandates with that risk in mind. S. Rep. No. \n111-176, at 10.21 The CFPB’s sudden shuttering means that there will be drastically reduced \noversight of the very large banks, to the detriment of consumers. Other federal regulators are not \npositioned to pick up this slack because, as the Department of the Treasury had recommended in \nthe wake of the Great Recession, Congress expressly transferred to the CFPB certain consumer-\n \n18 Reuters, Fed’s Powell: No Agency Other Than CFPB Tasked With Consumer Protection \nEnforcement (Feb. 11, 2025). \n19 See generally Arthur E. Wilmarth, Jr., The Expansion of State Bank Powers, the Federal \nResponse, and the Case for Preserving the Dual Banking System, 58 Fordham L. Rev. 1133, 1152 \n(1990). \n20 National Consumer Law Center, Restore the States’ Traditional Role as ‘First Responder’, \nat 22 (Sep. 2009). \n21 See John Mullin, Shopping for Bank Regulators, Econ Focus of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof Richmond (4th quarter 2019). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 19 of 26\n \nprotection functions that had previously been dispersed among multiple federal agencies,.22 \nAccordingly, the CFPB is now the only federal entity that is statutorily authorized to supervise and \nbring enforcement actions against national banks under federal law in connection with the abusive-\npractices provisions of the CFPA. States, meanwhile, are statutorily precluded from enforcing \nthose provisions  unless and until the CFPB promulgates regulations under those provisions, see \n12 U.S.C. §§ 5531, 5552(a)(2)(A), which it has not yet done. The CFPB’s dismantling thus leaves \nno entity that is empowered by federal law to target abusive practices by those banks (including \nthe nation’s largest banks), effectively nullifying a crucial federal statutory protection for the \nnation’s consumers. The resulting prospect of the States’ residents being offered riskier products \nby unsupervised banks, and of state-chartered banks losing customers and goodwill by being \nundercut by now unsupervised very large banks, constitute irreparable harms that should be \nprevented by a preliminary injunction.  \nC.  The CFPB’s Failure to Fulfill Its Statutory Mandates of Supervision and \nEnforcement in Areas of Historic Joint Collaboration Substantially Increases \nthe Burden on States to Protect Consumers. \nDefendants’ actions to dismantle the CFPB have already begun to harm the States by \nsuddenly increasing the burden on them to protect their residents through both enforcement and \nsupervision of the financial industry. The loss of CFPB’s partnership has concrete and far-reaching \nimplications: from collaborating on supervisory examinations, to sharing of complaints and trend \ndata, to providing training, to partnering on joint investigations and litigations, the CFPB has been \na force multiplier for States’ consumer-protection efforts. Absent a preliminary injunction to \nprevent the sudden loss of these significant contributions, the States will be unexpectedly stretched. \n \n22 Dep’t of Treasury, Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, at 143–46 \n(Mar. 2008) \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 20 of 26\n \nSupervision. The CFPB was designed to enable States to benefit from a synergistic \nrelationship in many areas, ensuring coverage across sectors of a sprawling financial industry and \nits evolving products. While the CFPB has supervisory authority over approximately 200 of the \nlargest financial institutions in the country,23 it shares supervisory authority with States and \naugments States’ own supervisory efforts in a number of important ways. First, States rely on the \nCFPB to supervise compliance with federal consumer-protection laws by very large national \nbanks, over which the CFPB has “exclusive authority,” 12 U.S.C. § 5515(b)(1).24 Information \ngleaned from this supervision is regularly shared with the States and can inform States’ decisions \non how to supervise and identify risk within the financial institutions under their direct supervision.  \nSecond, the CFPB and States each have supervisory authority over the largest state-chartered \nbanks, nonbank entities offering consumer financial products such as nonbank mortgage lenders \nand payday lenders, and emerging markets such as digital payments. Because many States’ \ndecisions about how best to allocate resources have relied on the CFPB’s role in these areas, the \nCFPB’s sudden absence will create gaps in supervision that will be difficult to fill at all, let alone \npromptly. \nThe resulting vacuum will uniquely burden States. A number of the 200-plus very large \nbanks over which the CFPB has supervisory authority are state-chartered banks, each with more \nthan $10 billion in assets. The CFPB’s lack of supervision of those banks will place a huge burden \n \n23 This includes banks, thrifts, and credit unions with assets over $10 billion and their affiliates. \n12 U.S.C. § 5515. As of September 30, 2024, 179 depository institutions and approximately 21 \ndepository  affiliates  met  this  criteria.  See  CFPB,  Institutions  Subject  to  CFPB  Supervisory \nAuthority (last visited Feb. 21, 2025). \n24 See, e.g., CFPB Supervisory Highlights, Issue 37 (Winter 2024) (summarizing CFPB’s \nrecent findings that some large institutions were charging unlawful overdraft fees or engaging in \nother unlawful conduct that resulted multiple fees being charged to consumer bank accounts being \nfor having insufficient funds). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 21 of 26\n \non States—especially those that particularly rely on CFPB’s expertise and resources—to fill the \nvoid, again with no advance notice. Notably, the shutdown has already disrupted at least one \nexamination that had been jointly scheduled by the CFPB with several States including California, \nand the CFPB’s continued shuttering may impact others scheduled to proceed in the foreseeable \nfuture. The CFPB’s oversight of the largest state-chartered banks throughout the country also helps \nprovide consistency in examination and allows the CFPB to monitor nationwide trends and \nsimilarities that may need to be addressed. Leaving authority entirely to individual States will \nhamper their ability to monitor to such trends.  \nEven for smaller state-chartered banks that do not fall under the CFPB’s examination \nauthority, the CFPB has provided essential resources and training to assist many States. Regular \ncalls between the CFPB and States have helped to identify emerging issues; CFPB data and \nanalytics have helped States identify trends. Many States also regularly refer to the CFPB’s \ntraining materials and participate in CFPB-led trainings. For example, the District of Columbia \nregularly uses CFPB’s materials in credit-repair workshops that it offers to District residents. And \nIllinois participates in the CFPB’s in-depth trainings on the Loan Originator Compensation \nRequirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), with which mortgage licensees must \ncomply. 12 C.F.R. Pt. 1026. \nStates similarly benefit from the CFPB’s concurrent jurisdiction over nonbank entities \noffering consumer financial products.  For one, the CFPB has ferreted out and deters misconduct \nthrough its oversight. Without oversight by the CFPB, many consumers obtaining credit from a \nnonbank mortgage loan originator will be left without key protections. The same will be true for \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 22 of 26\n \nthose seeking auto financing or payday loans, as well as those subject to debt collection or \nmortgage servicing.25 \nIn addition, CFPB’s coordination of multistate examinations and data collection has \nprovided efficiency to participating States and the nonbank institutions they regulate. The CFPB \nhas used its robust data and analytics to help States determine scope and priorities for examination, \nincluding by making training available to state agency personnel to ensure consistent and high \nstandards. And for 2025, the coordinated multistate examination schedule has already been set. \nState resources have been committed on the understanding that the CFPB would supply expertise, \nexaminers, and contribute significantly to examination planning and execution. The loss of \nCFPB’s partnership in supervising nonbank entities and in providing nationwide market data and \ninsight into these sectors will dramatically increase the burden on States to supervise in areas vital \nto both consumers and the stability of the nation’s economy. \nFinally, States will not have the benefit of mandated CFPB supervision of the emerging \nmarket of digital-payment providers such as PayPal, Venmo, and their large competitors, which \nprocess over $1 trillion in payments annually. In November 2024, the CFPB finalized a rule to \nprovide  federal  oversight  of  digital-payment  companies  that  process  more  than  50  million \ntransactions  annually.  Defining  Larger  Participants  of  a  Market  for  General-Use  Digital \nConsumer Payment Applications, 89 Fed. Reg. 99582 (2024). The rule also seeks to protect \nconsumer data, to strengthen protections against fraud, and to prevent scams through these digital-\npayment apps. With the CFPB now ceasing all activity, States will suddenly be left without a \nsignificant partner to police this fast-growing industry.  \n \n25 See, e.g., CFPB Supervisory Highlights, Issue 35 (Fall 2024) (summarizing results of \nexams  of  auto  finance  companies);  CFPB  Supervisory  Highlights,  Issue  33  (Spring  2024) \n(summarizing results of mortgage servicing exams). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 23 of 26\n \nEnforcement. The CFPB has exercised indispensable enforcement authority, alongside the \nStates, over consumer financial laws and to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive \nacts and practices in consumer financial markets. The shuttering of the CFPB will be extremely \ndisruptive to ongoing litigation in which the CFPB has been an active partner. Experts who have \nbeen retained by the CFPB to assist in such ongoing litigation matters have had their contracts \nabruptly terminated, and States will now have to take over sole responsibility for such joint \nlitigation. One such case is CFPB v. StratFS, LLC, No. 24-cv-00040 (W.D.N.Y.), in which seven \nStates partnered with the CFPB to shut down an illegal debt-relief scheme. The States will now \nhave to assume sole responsibility for that litigation, which remains active in both the trial and \nappellate courts. Meanwhile, the defendants in that case are already seeking to take advantage of \nthe CFPB’s inactivity: they have sought to have a previously entered preliminary injunction lifted \non the ground that “the CFPB may still exist in theory, but it is wholly nonfunctional.” (ECF No. \n613 at 3.) \nThese responsibilities will require the States to divert resources from other crucial law-\nenforcement efforts. Thus, in addition to the direct harms imposed by the CFPB’s absence, its \nabsence will also have ripple effects throughout the country, to the detriment of consumers. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/21/25     Page 24 of 26\n \nDated: February 21, 2025   Respectfully submitted, \n \nMATTHEW J.

Public reporting puts the total number of people terminated at approximately \n1,400-1,500.1 That’s consistent with information the plaintiffs’ counsel have received. As one \nwould expect with a RIF of that size, the plaintiffs have been told that entire offices, including \nstatutorily mandated ones, have or soon will be either eliminated or reduced to a single person. \nAnd all affected employees will be entirely cut off from computer access—a functional work \nstoppage—at 6:00 pm tomorrow, April 18.2 \n  These RIFs appear to go well beyond what the unstayed portions of this Court’s injunction \npermit.

It is unfathomable that cutting the Bureau’s staff by 90 percent in just 24 hours, with no notice \nto people to prepare for that elimination, would not “interfere with the performance” of its statutory \nduties, to say nothing of the implausibility of the defendants having made a “particularized \nassessment” of each employee’s role in the three-and-a-half business days since the court of \nappeals imposed that requirement.  \n  The plaintiffs request that this Court issue an order to show cause why the defendants have \nnot violated its preliminary injunction order and schedule a hearing as soon as possible. \nDated: April 17, 2025   Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n/s/ Deepak Gupta   /s/ Wendy Liu                            \nDeepak Gupta (DC Bar No. 495451)  Wendy Liu (DC Bar No. 1600942) \nRobert Friedman (D.C.

It is\nFURTHER ORDERED that the district court’s March 28, 2025 order granting\nappellees’ motion for a preliminary injunction is stayed in part pending appeal.\nProvision two (2) is stayed insofar as it requires defendants to reinstate\nemployees whom defendants have determined, after an individualized assessment, to\nbe unnecessary to the performance of defendants’ statutory duties.  \nProvision three (3) is stayed insofar as it prohibits defendants from terminating or\nissuing a notice of reduction in force to employees whom defendants have determined,\nafter a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants’\nstatutory duties.  \nThe court understands provision four (4) to allow work stoppages that\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5091 September Term, 2024\ndefendants have determined, after a particularized assessment, would not interfere with\nthe performance of defendants’ statutory duties.

Circuit has expedited Defendants’ appeal from this Court’s \norder granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 88 (the “PI Order”).  Order, \nNational Treasury Employees Union, v. Vought, No. 25-5091 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 11, 2025) (attached \nas Exhibit 1).  Under the expedited schedule, briefing is complete by May 13, 2025, and oral \nargument is calendared for May 16, 2025.  Id.  Especially given that extremely expedited schedule, \nDefendants respectfully request that this Court stay further district court proceedings in this matter \nuntil Defendants’ appeal from the PI Order is finally resolved.  A stay of district court proceedings \n“to await a federal appellate decision that is likely to have a substantial or controlling effect on the \nclaims and issues in the stayed case” is “at least a good, if not an excellent” reason to stay \nproceedings.  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 559 F.3d 1191, \n1198 (11th Cir. 2009).  Such a stay would not prejudice Plaintiffs as it would not affect the PI \nOrder already entered by this Court.  Nor would it unduly delay resolution of this matter given the \nexpedition of the appeal.  Ex. 1.  Moreover, a stay would conserve resources of the Court and the \nparties and minimize the risk of conflicting decisions. \nShould this Court deny Defendants’ request for a stay, Defendants respectfully ask, in the \nalternative, for an extension of time to respond to the Amended Complaint until thirty days after \nany such denial.  Defendants have conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel about the relief sought in this \nmotion, and Plaintiffs oppose the relief requested. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs  filed  their  operative Amended  Complaint  on  February  13,  2025,  seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Am. Compl., ECF No. 7.  Invoking non-statutory causes of \naction, the Amended Complaint seeks an order that Defendants “resume immediately all activities \nthat [the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”)] is required by statute to perform.”  Id. \nat 31, Prayer for Relief (D).  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, the Amended \nComplaint asks this Court to hold unlawful and set aside “[D]efendants’ actions and intended \nfurther actions to dismantle the CFPB, including issuance of stop-work instructions, cancellation \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 3 of 10\nof contracts, declining and returning funding, reductions in force, firing of employees, and \ntermination of the lease for its headquarters[.]”  Id., Prayer for Relief (B). \nLater on February 13, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order and \nadministrative stay.  ECF No. 10.  On February 14, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in support of \nthat motion.  ECF No. 14.  Upon agreement of the parties and following a scheduling conference, \nthe Court issued an order converting Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order into a \nmotion  for  a  preliminary  injunction.    ECF  No.  19.   The  Court’s  order  also  memorialized \nDefendants’ agreement that, until the Court rules on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, \nCFPB will not destroy certain records, will not terminate CFPB employees except for cause, and \nwill not transfer CFPB’s reserve funds.  See id. \nOn March 3, 2025, the Court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction, \nand, during the following week, held a two-day evidentiary hearing.  ECF Nos 58, 73, 74.  On \nMarch 28, 2025, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, granting Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  ECF Nos. 87, 88. \nAfter Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit, ECF No. 89, on April 11, \n2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an order staying the PI Order in part pending appeal.  Ex. 1.  In \naddition, the D.C. Circuit, on its own motion, ordered that Defendants’ appeal of the PI Order be \nexpedited.  Id.  Under the expedited schedule, briefing in the D.C. Circuit is to be completed by \nMay 13, 2025, and argument on Defendants’ appeal is scheduled for May 16, 2025.  Id.  \nDefendants’  deadline  to  answer  or  otherwise  respond  to  the Amended  Complaint  is \ncurrently April 16, 2025.  See ECF No. 49; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(2). \n   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 4 of 10\nARGUMENT \nThe Court should stay further district court proceedings in this case until Defendants’ \nappeal of the PI Order is finally resolved.  A stay is supported by all of the traditional stay factors.  \nAlternatively, should this Court deny Defendants’ request for a stay, Defendants respectfully ask \nfor an extension of time to respond to the Amended Complaint until thirty days after any such \ndenial. \nI.  A Stay of Proceedings Would Promote Judicial Economy and Conserve the \nParties’ Resources by Awaiting Appellate Guidance on Important Legal Issues. \nThe Court should stay further district court proceedings in this case pending Defendants’ \nappeal of the PI Order because an appellate court ruling is likely to provide substantial, if not \ndispositive, guidance to this Court and the parties in resolving the merits issues presented in this \ncase.  Moreover, a stay would not prejudice Plaintiffs given that Defendants must comply with this \nCourt’s PI Order, subject to the D.C. Circuit’s stay, or risk contempt. \nA district court “has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to \ncontrol its own docket.”  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997).  Thus, “[a] trial court may, \nwith propriety, find it is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a \nstay of an action before it, pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the \ncase.”  Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Civ. A. No. 20-\n1630, 2021 WL 4033072, at 1 (D.D.C. Sept. 3, 2021) (quoting Hisler v. Gallaudet Univ., 344 F. \nSupp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C. 2004)).  “In deciding whether to grant a stay, courts generally ‘weigh \ncompeting interests and maintain an even balance between the court’s interests in judicial economy \nand any possible hardship to the parties.’”  Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of \nSpain, 397 F. Supp. 3d 34, 39 (D.D.C. 2019) (quoting Belize Soc. Dev. Ltd. v. Gov’s of Belize, 668 \nF.3d 724, 732-33 (D.C. Cir. 2012)). \nWeighing the relevant interests confirms a stay is warranted here.  First, a stay could not \nplausibly prejudice Plaintiffs given that Defendants must comply with this Court’ PI Order, subject \nto the D.C. Circuit’s stay.  The proposed stay would not affect the PI Order at all and would merely \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 5 of 10\nstay further litigation in district court in this case pending appellate resolution on potentially \ndispositive issues.  See, e.g., Latta v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 653 F. Supp. 3d 435, 440-41 (S.D. Ohio \n2023) (no prejudice to Plaintiff from stay because challenged program “is currently enjoined”); \nElectronic Order, Walker v. Azar, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020) (granting \nstay pending appeal of preliminary injunction and finding that the “possibility of further irreparable \nharm  to  the  plaintiffs  pending  appeal  is  mitigated  by  the  extant  preliminary  injunction”); \nWashington v. Trump, No. C17-0141JLR, 2017 WL 1050354, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 17, 2017) \n(finding that any prejudice to plaintiffs from stay would be “minimal—if there is any at all” in \nlight of the preliminary injunctive relief already in effect); Hawaii v. Trump, 233 F. Supp. 3d 850, \n853-54 (D. Haw. 2017) (same); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., No. 1:15-108-CL, 2015 WL \n13744253, at *2 (D. Or. Aug. 6, 2015) (same); see also Whitman-Walker, 2021 WL 4033072, at *2 \n(finding that prejudice to plaintiffs from a stay of proceedings minimized because conduct “that \nform[s] the heart of Plaintiffs’ objections [is] currently—and will remain—enjoined”). \nMoreover, Defendants’ proposed stay is of a limited duration, given the D.C. Circuit’s order \nexpediting appellate proceedings.  Ex. 1.  The D.C. Circuit has ordered the parties to proceed on \nan extremely expedited basis, with oral argument being held in about a month, on May 16, 2025.  \nId.  Given the speed of the expedited appeal, the Government’s requested stay is reasonable in \nlength and will not prejudice Plaintiffs.  See Hawaii, 233 F. Supp. 3d at 854 (“[T]he expedited \ntimeline of appellate proceedings that has already been on display before the Ninth Circuit in the \nWestern District of Washington case indicates that any delay in this case pending resolution of that \nappeal will be reasonable in length.  And if that does not turn out to be the case, any party may \npetition the Court to lift or partially lift the stay for good cause[.]”); see also Washington, 2017 \nWL 2172020, at *4 (noting “expedited briefing in the Hawaii appeal”). \nBy contrast, requiring Defendants to defend this action in district court without waiting for \nappellate resolution of the issues raised in this case would be a wasteful exercise.  See, e.g., \nWhitman-Walker, 2021 WL 4033072, at *3 (“In the interim, a substantial amount of the parties’ \nand the Court’s resources would have been expended and potentially for little gain.”).  First, the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 6 of 10\nparties would be required to brief and litigate a motion to dismiss—even though the motion to \ndismiss would present many of the same legal arguments that the Government raised in opposition \nto Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and the Government will soon be asking the D.C. \nCircuit to address.  Briefing a motion to dismiss, and this Court’s consideration of the motion, \nwould itself be wasteful.  Cf. Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of State, 925 F. Supp. 2d 55, 59 (D.D.C. \n2013) (granting a stay “[n]ot needing more lawyers to spend more time on more briefs on more \nsubjects”).  A D.C. Circuit ruling on appeal could prove fully or partially dispositive of the issues \nin this case or, at the very least, “will have a significant impact on the litigation going forward.”  \nSee Electronic Order, Walker, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020). \nMoreover, if the Court were to deny a motion to dismiss—as it has tentatively signaled, \nsee ECF No. 87 at 61-101 (concluding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims in Count \nOne and their Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claims)—denial of that motion would not \nitself resolve Plaintiffs’ claims or provide them any relief.  Instead, denial of that motion would \nonly require the parties to move into the next stage of the litigation—increasing the burden on the \nparties still further.  And depending on what Plaintiffs propose as the next stage of the litigation, \nthat could embroil the parties and the Court in significant and time-consuming disputes regarding \nthe appropriate scope of discovery (if any).  Of course, the next stage of the proceedings would \nalso depend on the resolution of certain fundamental questions governing this case, which the D.C. \nCircuit may soon decide.1 \n \n1 For example, Plaintiffs have requested that Defendants produce the administrative record.  \nBut administrative records are correlated with a discrete agency action, as defined by the APA, \nsuch as a rule or an order.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  And they consist of the materials considered \nby the agency in generating that circumscribed and discrete agency action.  See ECF No. 31 at 17; \nJames Madison Ltd. by Hecht v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Ctr for Auto Safety \nv. Fed. Highway Admin., 956 F.2d 309, 314 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Thompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, \n885 F.2d 551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989); Pac. Shores Subdivision Cal. Water Dist. v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 448 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2006).  As Defendants have indicated, ECF No. 31 at 17, it \nis far from clear what Plaintiffs are demanding given that no APA count seeks judicial review of a \nstandalone rule, order, license, sanction, or relief, that is circumscribed and discrete.  Rather, the \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 7 of 10\nFor similar reasons, there are obvious benefits to judicial economy in awaiting further \nappellate court guidance.  As noted above, an appellate ruling may prove dispositive or, at the very \nleast, provide guidance on relevant legal issues and facilitate further proceedings in this case.  A \nstay will also minimize the risk of conflicting decisions that could result from simultaneously \nlitigating the same issues in this Court and in the D.C. Circuit.  Even if this Court were to decide \na motion to dismiss or undertake further proceedings in this case, therefore, all of it could be for \nnaught.  A different governing legal framework for this case, based on further appellate court \nguidance, would require this Court to go back and re-analyze everything to ensure its prior \ndecisions  are  consistent  with  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  decision.    “Thus,  staying  this  case  avoids \nduplicative and potentially unnecessary litigation, conserving judicial resources.”  See Whole \nWoman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, Case No. A-16-CA-1300-SS, 2017 WL 5649477, at *2 (W.D. Tex. \nMar. 16, 2017). \nFor precisely these reasons, courts have held that awaiting “a federal appellate decision \nthat is likely to have a substantial or controlling effect on the claims and issues in the stayed case” \nprovide “a good . . . if not an excellent” “reason for [a] district court’s stay.” See Miccosukee Tribe \nof Indians of Fla., 559 F.3d at 1198.  Indeed, courts in this district frequently stay proceedings \nwhere issues in the litigation are pending before a higher court.  See, e.g., Univ. of Colo. Health \nMem’l Hosp.  v. Burwell, No. 14-cv-1220, 2017 WL 535246, at *12 (D.D.C. Feb. 9, 2017) \n(“Because many of the applicable issues may be resolved by the D.C. Circuit, and because the \nD.C. Circuit may otherwise provide instruction on the issues here, the Court finds a stay would \nserve the interests of judicial efficiency.”); Allina Health Servs. v. Sebelius, 756 F. Supp. 2d 61, 71 \n(D.D.C. 2010) (finding “good cause to stay this matter” given that “the parties agree that the \n \nAmended Complaint seeks judicial review of “[D]efendants’ actions and intended further actions \nto dismantle the CFPB, including issuance of stop-work instructions, cancellation of contracts, \ndeclining and returning funding, reductions in force, firing of employees, and termination of the \nlease for its headquarters[.]”  Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief (B).  See also Am. Compl. ¶ 91; ECF \nNo. 31 at 17 (“Wholesale challenges to programmatic decision-making make it impossible for the \nagency to ‘compl[e] and ‘organiz[e] the complete administrative record’ for the agency action . . . \nbecause there is no discrete agency action”) (citation omitted). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 8 of 10\nresolution of [a related case] by the D.C. Circuit will be dispositive of the Plaintiffs’ arguments \nhere”).2 \nIn short, an appellate decision likely would permeate every aspect of this case.  And given \nthe D.C. Circuit’s order, on its own motion, that Defendants’ appeal be expedited and for oral \nargument to take place in about one month, the balance of interests weigh overwhelmingly in favor \nof a stay of proceedings here.  It is far more efficient—and far less burdensome on the parties and \nthe  Court—to  stay  proceedings  pending  expedited  appellate  review.    Cf.  IBT/HERE  Emps. \nRepresentatives’ Council v. Gate Gourmet Div. Ams., 402 F. Supp. 2d 289, 293 (D.D.C. 2005) \n(granting a stay when a decision in a separate proceeding “may affect the parties’ understanding \nof the scope of this case going forward, may reorient the parties’ arguments, may catalyze a \nsettlement of this matter, . . . or may resolve the issues raised in this lawsuit in their entirety”).  \nConsistent with the weight of authority, this Court should likewise stay further proceedings \npending expedited appellate review. \nII.  In the Alternative, the Court Should Extend the Deadline to Respond to the \nAmended Compliant. \nAlternatively, if the Court denies a stay of proceedings, Defendants respectfully request an \nextension of the current deadline of April 16, 2025, to respond to the Amended Complaint until \nthirty days after any such denial.  Defendants make this request under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 6(b), under which extensions are granted “for good cause[.]”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).  The \n“good cause” requirement means “a party must demonstrate some justification for the issuance of \nthe extension.”  4B Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1165 (4th ed.).  See \n \n2 Even outside the appeal context, courts within this District also routinely grant stays to \nallow the conclusion of other related proceedings.  See, e.g., Hussain v. Lewis, 848 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n2 (D.D.C. 2012) (staying case pending state court proceedings and arbitration request); Fonville v. \nDist. of Columbia, 766 F. Supp. 2d 171, 174 (D.D.C. 2011) (staying case pending resolution of \nlitigation in the D.C. Court of Appeals); Canady v. Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, 271 F. Supp. 2d \n64, 74-75 (D.D.C. 2002) (granting stay pending ongoing agency proceedings); IBT/HERE Emps. \nRepresentatives’ Council, 402 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (staying case pending arbitrator’s decision); \nFairview Hosp. v. Leavitt, No. 05-cv-1065, 2007 WL 1521233, at *3 (D.D.C. May 22, 2007) \n(granting a stay pending district court’s resolution of a similar case). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 9 of 10\nAlexander v. Saul, 5 F.4th 139, 154 (2d Cir. 2021) (explaining that “‘good cause’ in the context of \nRule 6(b)(1) [i]s a ‘non-rigorous standard’” (quoting Manigault v. ABC Inc., 796 F. App’x 13, 15 \n(2d Cir. 2019))). \nGood cause supports the requested extension.  This is Defendants’ first requested extension \nof the deadline to respond to the complaint, and granting the extension will not unduly delay this \naction or affect other pending deadlines.  Such an extension would allow Defendants to obtain a \nCourt ruling on their request for a stay, which Defendants have sought in good faith and which, in \ntheir view, is supported by good cause and the interests of judicial and party economy. \nAn extension is also justified due to the press of this and other litigation matters.  In that \nregard, Defendants have already expended a  substantial amount of resources responding to \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, which was converted into a motion for a \npreliminary injunction, during the 60-day period that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide \nthe Government to respond to a complaint.  In addition to this case, Defendants have expended \nsignificant resources addressing emergency motion practice in another case involving the CFPB.  \nMayor and City Council of Baltimore v. CFPB, Case No. 25-cv-458-MJM (D.Md.). \nMoreover, additional time to respond to the Complaint is needed due to the press of other \nbusiness as well as the annual leave of attorneys assigned to this matter.  Undersigned counsel for \nDefendants faces demands from his docket of other cases unrelated to the CFPB, which are in need \nof attention given the resources that this case has consumed to date.  Finally, Defendants’ counsel \nrequires additional time to address issues necessarily raised by the Amended Complaint. \nCONCLUSION \nThe  Court  should  stay  further  proceedings  in  this  matter  until  final  resolution  of \nDefendants’ appeal of this Court’s PI Order. \n   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 104     Filed 04/15/25     Page 10 of 10\n \nDated: April 15, 2025       Respectfully submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

These actions included terminating employees, \ncancelling contracts, declining additional funding, moving to \nsmaller  headquarters,  and  requiring  advance  approval  for \nagency work.  The plaintiffs in this case either represent CFPB \nemployees or use services provided by the agency.  They sued \nto stop what they describe as a decision to “shut down” the \nBureau.  The district court found that agency leadership had \nmade such a decision and then entered a preliminary injunction \nseverely  restricting  agency  actions  regarding  employment, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 4 of 109\n4 \ncontracting, and facilities, among other things.  We hold that \nthe district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims \npredicated on loss of employment, which must proceed through \nthe specialized-review scheme established in the Civil Service \nReform Act.  And the other plaintiffs’ claims target neither \nfinal  agency  action  reviewable  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act nor unconstitutional action reviewable in equity.  \nAccordingly, we vacate the preliminary injunction. \nI \nA \nIn 2010, Congress established the Consumer Financial \nProtection  Bureau  to  enforce  federal  laws  that  protect \nconsumers  of  financial  products.    12  U.S.C.  § 5511(a).  \nCongress transferred to the CFPB “the authority to administer \n18 existing consumer protection statutes,” and it “vested the \nBureau  with  rulemaking,  enforcement,  and  adjudicatory \nauthority” over those statutes.  CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n \nof Am., 601 U.S. 416, 421–22 (2024).  Congress authorized the \nCFPB to pursue five general objectives: provide timely and \nunderstandable information to consumers, protect consumers \nfrom  unfair  practices,  reduce  regulatory  burdens,  enforce \nconsumer  financial  laws  consistently,  and  encourage  the \nrelevant markets to operate transparently and efficiently.  12 \nU.S.C. § 5511(b). \nCongress gave the CFPB broad discretion regarding how \nto pursue these goals.  For example, the Bureau’s general grant \nof rulemaking power is expressly permissive; it states that the \nagency “may prescribe rules and issue orders and guidance, as \nmay  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  enable  the  Bureau  to \nadminister and carry out the purposes and objectives of the \nFederal  consumer  financial  laws,  and  to  prevent  evasions \nthereof.”  12 U.S.C. § 5512(b)(1); see also id. § 5531(b) (CFPB \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 5 of 109\n5 \n“may prescribe rules” regarding certain “unfair, deceptive, or \nabusive  acts  or  practices”).    The  Bureau’s  enforcement \nauthority is also discretionary.  See id. § 5562 (CFPB “may” \nconduct  investigations,  subpoena  witnesses,  or  demand \ndocuments).  So is its adjudicatory authority.  Id. § 5563(a) \n(CFPB “is authorized to conduct hearings and adjudication \nproceedings”). \nThe CFPB is mostly free to organize its internal affairs as \nit wishes.  For example, it may establish “general policies … \nwith respect to all executive and administrative functions,” 12 \nU.S.C. § 5492(a), including personnel and contracting matters, \nid. § 5492(a)(2),  (3),  (7).    The  Director  also  may  “fix  the \nnumber  of,  and  appoint  and  direct,  all  employees  of  the \nBureau.”    Id.  § 5493(a)(1)(A).    And  the  Director  has \nunreviewable discretion to determine how much funding the \nBureau needs to carry out its objectives, subject only to a \nstatutory cap.  Id. § 5497(a)(1)–(2); see id. § 5497(a)(2)(C) \n(barring  congressional  committees  from  reviewing  the \nDirector’s determination). \nCongress did require the CFPB to provide some specific \nservices to the public.  For example, the Bureau must establish \n“reasonable  procedures  to  provide  a  timely  response  to \nconsumers” for inquiries or complaints.  12 U.S.C. § 5534(a); \nsee id. § 5493(b)(3)(A) (requiring toll-free telephone number, \nwebsite, and database for consumer complaints).  The agency \nmust prepare reports about interest rates, credit cards, and other \nmatters.    See  id.  § 5493(b)(1);  15  U.S.C.  §§ 1646(a)–(b), \n1632(d)(3).  It must help compile information about depository \ninstitutions.  12 U.S.C. § 2809(b).  And it must have a “Private \nEducation Loan Ombudsman” to “provide timely assistance to \nborrowers of private education loans.”  Id. § 5535(a). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 6 of 109\n6 \nB \nIn  early  2025,  the  President  took  several  steps  to \nimplement a new deregulatory agenda.  On January 20, he \nimposed a cross-agency freeze on new regulatory actions.  See \nRegulatory Freeze Pending Review, 90 Fed. Reg. 8249 (Jan. \n20, 2025).  On February 26, he imposed a cost-cutting initiative \nthat required agency heads to scale back contracts, grants, real \nestate, and other expenses.  See Exec. Order No. 14,222, 90 \nFed. Reg. 11095 (Feb. 26, 2025). \nThese  initiatives  brought  changes  to  the  Bureau.    On \nFriday,  January  31,  the  President  removed  the  incumbent \nCFPB Director and designated Scott Bessent as the agency’s \nActing Director.  On Monday, February 3, Bessent instructed \nagency employees and contractors to pause most activities \nwhile he evaluated them for “consistency with the goals of the \nAdministration.”  J.A. 110.  Bessent made clear, however, that \nthe pause did not apply to work “expressly approved by the \nActing Director or required by law.”  Id.  On February 7, the \nPresident designated Russell Vought to replace Bessent as \nActing Director.  On February 8, Vought reiterated the pause \non  CFPB  work,  with  the  same  exception  for  activities \n“expressly approved by the Acting Director or required by \nlaw.”  Id. at 117.  The same day, Vought concluded that \nexisting  funds—which  exceeded  $700  million—were \n“sufficient” for the Bureau to meet its statutory mandates for \nthe next fiscal quarter.  Id. at 123.  On February 9, CFPB \nleadership decided to close the Bureau’s headquarters for a \nweek because of protests outside the building.  Id. at 105–06, \n119.  Around the same time, they also decided to cancel the \nlease  of  agency  headquarters,  which  had  remained  largely \nvacant since the COVID pandemic, and to move the Bureau to \nsmaller headquarters.  Id. at 104, 106. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 7 of 109\n7 \nOn February 10, Vought issued a new directive reminding \nemployees of the office closure and instructing them to “not \nperform any work tasks” without prior approval from Chief \nLegal Officer Mark Paoletta.  J.A. 101.  The parties dispute \nwhether this directive required approval for legally mandated \nactivities or whether it carried forward the exception from the \nFebruary 3 and February 8 emails.  In any event, Paoletta did \napprove some legally required work, starting on February 10.  \nSee id. at 286–87 (exempting “work to publish the Average \nPrime Offer Rate”—a legally required task—“from the stop \nwork  order”).1    And  on  March  2,  Paoletta  clarified  that \n“[e]mployees should be performing work that is required by \nlaw and do not need to seek prior approval to do so.”  Id. at \n387.  In the interim, though, some required work was neglected, \nsuch as maintenance of the consumer-complaint database. \nOver  the  same  timeframe,  the  Bureau  also  addressed \ncontract and personnel matters.  On February 11, its Chief \nFinancial Officer instructed component heads to identify which \ncontracts directly supported statutory obligations.  J.A. 416–17.  \nAgency  leadership  decided  to  cancel  all  contracts  in  five \ncomponents and all but two contracts in a sixth, id. at 288, 407, \nthough it is unclear how many of those contracts actually were \n \n1  See also, e.g., J.A. 298–300 (approving work related to the \ncall  center,  online  complaint  form,  and  a  required  report  for \nCongress); id. at 306 (approving the Office of Fair Lending’s request \nto perform statutory functions); id. at 308 (directing an employee to \nattend meetings and perform trainings); id. at 284 (Bureau COO \nconfirming that work related to the consumer complaint database and \nhome mortgage disclosure application should continue); id. at 285 \n(confirming that the COO stated the work stoppage “does not apply \nto the … Consumer Resource Center”); id. at 313 (COO approving \nthe processing of FOIA requests); id. at 326 (COO confirming that \nemployees “can resume all regular work related to fulfilling statutory \nobligations”). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 8 of 109\n8 \ncancelled, see id. at 131 (plaintiffs’ declaration explaining that \ncontract cancellations would not take effect for at least thirty \ndays).  On February 19, Paoletta forbade employees from \ncancelling any contract “without specific authorization” from \nhimself or the Acting Director, id. at 654, and at least some \ncontracts  were  then  reactivated,  see  id.  at  378.    As  for \npersonnel, the Bureau terminated 85 probationary employees \nand  130  term  employees,  including  the  “Student  Loan \nOmbudsman.”  Id. at 421, 648, 650, 950–51.  It planned to \nimplement two Reductions in Force (RIFs), which would have \nterminated at least eighty percent of the Bureau’s remaining \nworkforce.  See id. at 649, 953, 1052.  It considered placing the \nremainder of its employees on administrative leave, unless they \nwere authorized to perform a work task.  See, e.g., id. at 465.  \nAnd it decided to eliminate software enabling employees to \nwork remotely.  Id. at 239. \nC \nSix  plaintiffs  claim  various  harms  from  these  actions, \nwhich they characterize as a coordinated effort “to eliminate \nthe  CFPB.”    J.A.  44.    Two  plaintiff  organizations—the \nNational Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and the CFPB \nEmployee Association—represent Bureau employees.  They \nallege that the wholesale termination of their members will \nharm the members and cause the organizations to lose revenue.  \nThree plaintiff organizations—the National Association for the \nAdvancement  of  Colored  People  (NAACP),  the  National \nConsumer Law Center (NCLC), and the Virginia Poverty Law \nCenter (VPLC)—claim harm from the loss of services provided \nby the Bureau.  NCLC also alleges that the Bureau cancelled \nsubscriptions to several of its publications.  The final plaintiff, \nTed Steege, alleges that his late wife could not meet with the \nStudent Loan Ombudsman after that official was fired. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 9 of 109\n9 \nThe plaintiffs brought two claims.  First, the government’s \n“actions to eliminate” the Bureau “usurp legislative authority \nconferred  upon  Congress  by  the  Constitution.”    J.A.  44.  \nSecond,  the  “actions  to  suspend  or  terminate  CFPB’s \nstatutorily  mandated  activities—including  by  issuing  stop-\nwork instructions, cancelling contracts, declining and returning \nfunding, firing employees, and terminating the lease for its \nheadquarters—constitute  final  agency  action”  that  is \nreviewable under the APA, unlawful, arbitrary, and in excess \nof the agency’s authority.  Id. at 46–47.2  The plaintiffs asked \nthe district court to set aside “actions and intended further \nactions to dismantle the CFPB, including issuance of stop-work \ninstructions, cancellation of contracts, declining and returning \nfunding,  reductions  in  force,  firing  of  employees,  and \ntermination of the lease for its headquarters.”  Id. at 47.  The \nplaintiffs further sought to enjoin the CFPB from issuing stop-\nwork  instructions  and  to  require  the  agency  “to  resume \nimmediately all activities that CFPB is required by statute to \nperform.”  Id. at 48. \nAfter  a  two-day  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district  court \ngranted a preliminary injunction on March 28.  The court found \nthat the government was “engaged in a concerted, expedited \neffort to shut the agency down” and that it had “no intention of \noperating the CFPB at all.”  See NTEU v. Vought, 774 F. Supp. \n3d  1,  58  (D.D.C.  2025).    From  that  premise,  the  court \nconcluded that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their \nseparation-of-powers  claim,  id.  at  55–77,  and  their  APA \nclaims, id. at 77–78.  The court identified only two putative \nfinal  agency  actions  undergirding  the  APA  claims:  the \nFebruary 10 email sent by Vought, id. at 77, and the “wholesale \n \n2  The plaintiffs also challenge the President’s designation of \nVought as the CFPB’s Acting Director.  J.A. 45.  The district court \ndid not pass on this claim, so neither do we. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 10 of 109\n10 \ncessation of activities—the decision to shut down the agency \ncompletely,” id. at 46.  Among other things, the preliminary \ninjunction required the government to reinstate all probationary \nand term employees who had been fired after February 10; to \nrefrain from firing any employee except for cause; to refrain \nfrom instituting any work stoppage; to rescind all contract \nterminations  issued  after  February  10;  to  provide  Bureau \nemployees with “either fully-equipped office space” or the \nmeans to work remotely; and to maintain a toll-free telephone \nnumber, website, and database in order to respond to consumer \ncomplaints.  Id. at 85–86. \nThe government appealed and moved for an emergency \nstay.  For purposes of the stay motion, it challenged only the \nscope of the preliminary injunction.  We issued a partial stay \nthat allowed the CFPB to terminate employees or stop work if \nthe agency determined, after a particularized assessment, that \nthe  employees  or  work  at  issue  were  unnecessary  to  the \nperformance of the Bureau’s statutory duties.  NTEU v. Vought, \nNo. 25-5091, 2025 WL 1721068 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 11, 2025). \nDays later, the agency issued a RIF notice to more than \neighty  percent  of  its  workforce.    J.A.  894.    The  Bureau \nrepresented that it had made the individualized assessment \nrequired by our partial stay order.  Rather than attempt to police \ncompliance with that requirement, we lifted the partial stay \ninsofar as it allowed the government to conduct RIFs.  NTEU \nv. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 1721136 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, \n2025). \nII \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that \nmay only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is \nentitled to such relief.”  Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff “must establish \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 11 of 109\n11 \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that \nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction \nis in the public interest.”  Id. at 20. We have reserved the \nquestion whether a strong showing on one of the Winter factors \nmay compensate for a weaker showing on another, despite \nexpressing some skepticism on that point.  Sherley v. Sebelius, \n644 F.3d 388, 392–93 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  Regardless of that \npossibility, if a court concludes that a claim fails as a matter of \nlaw—on a point of jurisdiction or merits—then a preliminary \ninjunction is inappropriate.  See United States Ass’n of Reptile \nKeepers, Inc. v. Zinke, 852 F.3d 1131, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(“When, as here, the ruling under review rests solely on a \npremise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are \nestablished or of no controlling relevance, we may resolve the \nmerits even though the appeal is from the entry of a preliminary \ninjunction.” (cleaned up)); see also, e.g., Munaf v. Geren, 553 \nU.S. 674, 691–92 (2008); Wrenn v. D.C., 864 F.3d 650, 667 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017); Arkansas Dairy Co-op Ass’n, Inc. v. USDA, \n573 F.3d 815, 832–33 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \nAlthough we review the grant of a preliminary injunction \nfor abuse of discretion, we review de novo any “underlying \nlegal conclusions.”  CityFed Fin. Corp. v. OTS, 58 F.3d 738, \n746 (D.C. Cir. 1995). \nIII \nAs always, we start with jurisdiction.  Because the district \ncourt  granted  a  preliminary  injunction,  our  appellate \njurisdiction is secure.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).  The CFPB \ncontends that the district court lacked statutory jurisdiction \nover the claims of organizations representing its employees and \nthat none of the other plaintiffs has Article III standing.  We \nagree with the first contention but disagree with the second. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 12 of 109\n12 \nA \nDistrict courts usually have jurisdiction over claims arising \nunder federal law, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, but a special statutory \nreview scheme may displace that jurisdiction.  Axon Enter., \nInc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 185 (2023).  To decide whether such \na scheme displaces section 1331, we consider two questions.  \nFirst, we ask whether a preclusive intent is “fairly discernible \nin the statutory scheme.”  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, \n510  U.S.  200,  207  (1994)  (cleaned  up).    Second,  we  ask \nwhether the claims at issue “are of the type Congress intended \nto be reviewed within” the special scheme.  Id. at 212. \nThe injuries alleged by NTEU and the CFPB Employee \nAssociation flow from their members’ loss of employment.  \nNTEU represents agency employees who have already been \nfired or may soon be fired, which will harm the employees and \ndecrease  NTEU’s  revenue.    The  Employee  Association \nlikewise represents such employees.  These plaintiffs thus seek \nto redress injuries from agency decisions to fire employees.  \nBut a specialized-review scheme governs such claims and ousts \nthe district courts of their arising-under jurisdiction. \nThe Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., \nwhich  includes  the  Federal  Service  Labor-Management \nRelations Statute, comprehensively “regulates virtually every \naspect of federal employment.”  Nyunt v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. \nof Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  Through it, \nCongress  “carefully  constructed  a  system  for  review  and \nresolution  of  federal  employment  disputes,  intentionally \nproviding—and intentionally not providing—particular forums \nand procedures for particular kinds of claims.”  Filebark v. \nDep’t of Transp., 555 F.3d 1009, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  The \nCSRA permits federal employees to seek review of adverse \npersonnel  actions  in  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 13 of 109\n13 \n(MSPB),  which  may  grant  relief  including  reinstatement, \nbackpay,  and  attorney’s  fees.    See  5  U.S.C.  §§ 7701(a), \n1204(a)(2), 7701(g); 5 C.F.R. § 351.901.  MSPB decisions in \nturn  are  reviewable  in  the  Federal  Circuit.    See  5  U.S.C. \n§ 7703(a)(1), (b)(1).  Similarly, the FSLMRS provides for the \nadjudication of federal labor disputes before the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority, which also may order reinstatement with \nbackpay.    See  id.  §§ 7105(a)(2)(G),  7116(a),  7118.    Its \ndecisions are reviewable in the courts of appeals.  Id. § 7123(a), \n(c).  For covered claims, this scheme is “exclusive.”  Elgin v. \nDep’t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5 (2012); see AFGE v. Trump, \n929 F.3d 748, 755 (D.C. Cir. 2019). \nThe organizations contend that their claims, though keyed \nto adverse employment actions taken against CFPB employees, \nfall outside the CSRA.  “Claims will be found to fall outside of \nthe  scope  of  a  special  statutory  scheme  in  only  limited \ncircumstances,  when  (1)  a  finding  of  preclusion  might \nforeclose all meaningful judicial review; (2) the claims are \nwholly collateral to the statutory review provisions; and (3) the \nclaims are beyond the expertise of the agency.”  AFGE, 929 \nF.3d at 755 (cleaned up).  Here, none of these considerations \napplies. \nFirst,  a  finding  of  preclusion  would  not  foreclose \nmeaningful judicial review.  The organizations’ injuries arise \nfrom the termination of their members, which the MSPB and \nFLRA may remedy by ordering reinstatement with backpay.  \nSee 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(a)(2), 7118(a)(7)(C).  The organizations \nobject that the MSPB or FLRA might not reinstate employees \nto positions that have been abolished.  But they cite only one \ndecision indicating that, as a matter of discretion, the MSPB \ndoes not typically reinstate employees to abolished positions \nwhen other comparable jobs are available.  See Bullock v. Dep’t \nof Air Force, 80 M.S.P.R. 361 (M.S.P.B. 1998).  In any event, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 14 of 109\n14 \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the  CSRA  provides  the \nexclusive  means  for  federal  employees  to  obtain  judicial \nreview of adverse personnel actions even in circumstances \nwhere, unlike here, the CSRA itself forecloses review.  See \nUnited States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 447 (1988). \nSecond, the organizations’ claims are not wholly collateral \nto the CSRA scheme.  Claims that “seek to reverse the removal \ndecisions” at issue are not wholly collateral to the CSRA, as \nthe Supreme Court held in Elgin.  See 567 U.S. at 22 (“A \nchallenge to removal is precisely the type of personnel action \nregularly adjudicated by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit \nwithin the CSRA scheme.”).  The organizations seek to obtain \nreinstatement for members already terminated and to prevent \nthe CFPB from terminating other members in the future, which \nis precisely the relief afforded through the CSRA. \nThird,  the  organizations’  claims  are  not  beyond  the \nexpertise of the MSPB and the FLRA.  As explained above, the \nclaims seek redress for allegedly unlawful terminations—the \nheartland of CSRA coverage.  The organizations object that \nthese  agencies  have  no  expertise  regarding  broad  disputes \nabout agency shutdowns.  In Elgin, however, the Supreme \nCourt held that the CSRA review scheme is exclusive even \nwhere the harmed employee contends that a governing “federal \nstatute is unconstitutional.”  567 U.S. at 5.  The same rationale \ncontrols here, where the claim is that an agency has violated \nthe Constitution by disregarding federal statutes.3 \n \n3  It is unclear whether the CFPB Employees Association, which \nis neither a federal employee nor a labor union, could itself invoke \nthe CSRA to obtain reinstatement for its members.  But assuming it \ncannot,  its  “exclusion  …  from  the  provisions  establishing \nadministrative and judicial review for personnel action” is no reason \nto permit it to seek judicial review of personnel actions under other \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 15 of 109\n15 \nIn  sum,  the  CSRA  precludes  district-court  jurisdiction \nover the claims of the NTEU and CFPB Employee Association. \nB \nThe  remaining  four  plaintiffs  do  not  seek  redress  for \nemployment-related injuries, but the government contends that \nthey lack constitutional standing under Article III.  In assessing \nthe sufficiency of standing allegations, we take the plaintiffs’ \nmerits theory as a given.  Tanner-Brown v. Haaland, 105 F.4th \n437, 444 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  Here, that means we assume that \nCFPB leadership was unlawfully attempting to dismantle the \nBureau.  For standing purposes, the question is whether these \nplaintiffs have shown that dismantling the Bureau would cause \nthem to suffer a concrete, particularized injury that a favorable \ndecision  would  likely  redress.    See  TransUnion  LLC  v. \nRamirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021).   \nAn organization can establish standing based on an injury \nto one or more of its members.  Students for Fair Admissions, \nInc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, \n199 (2023) (SFFA).  We call this kind of standing associational \nstanding.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 59, 65 (D.C. \nCir. 2016).  “To invoke it, an organization must demonstrate \nthat (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in \ntheir own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane \nto the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted \n \nprovisions.  Fausto, 484 U.S. at 455.  In Block v. Community \nNutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984), the Supreme Court held that \na statute creating a special statutory review scheme for challenges to \nregulatory action brought by dairy producers and handlers—but not \nconsumers—foreclosed judicial review for claims by consumers.  Id. \nat 347.  The same reasoning applies here; if employees cannot end-\nrun the CSRA’s reticulated scheme of administrative and judicial \nreview, then neither can organizations representing employees. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 16 of 109\n16 \nnor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \nmembers in the lawsuit.”  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 199 (cleaned up). \nThe NAACP meets these requirements.  It is a membership \norganization  that  works  to  “accelerate  the  well-being, \neducation,  and  economic  security  of  Black  people  and  all \npersons of color.”  J.A. 57.  In furtherance of that mission, it \nwas “actively working” with the CFPB “to address predatory \npractices for NAACP members who were victims of the Los \nAngeles wildfires.”  Id.  On the NAACP’s telling, the CFPB \npromised to send it educational materials for NAACP members \nbut “did not do so because of the shutdown.”  Id. at 58.  As a \nresult, at least one NAACP member, Juanita West-Tillman, \nwas denied access to these materials, which have at least some \nmonetary value.  See id. at 217–18.  She therefore suffered a \nconcrete injury.  And her injury would likely be redressed by \nan injunction, which would enable CFPB staff to proceed with \nits plans to assist wildfire victims.  Her injury also relates to the \nfinancial education of NAACP members, which is germane to \nthe NAACP’s purpose, and there is no reason this suit requires \nher  individual  participation.    The  NAACP  thus  has \nassociational standing. \nBecause  the  NAACP’s  claims  suffice  to  tee  up  the \ndispositive  questions  that  we  address  below,  we  need  not \nconsider whether the other plaintiffs have Article III standing.  \nBiden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023). \nIV \nThis  case  arises  from  several  actions  taken  by  CFPB \nleadership to downsize the agency.  They laid off employees, \ncancelled contracts, decided to move to smaller headquarters, \ndeclined additional funding, and subjected work to an advance-\napproval requirement.  In the ordinary course, the plaintiffs \nhere  could  challenge  many  of  these  actions  in  court.    As \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 17 of 109\n17 \nexplained  above,  aggrieved  employees  (like  members  of \nNTEU and the CFPB Employee Association) could challenge \ntheir terminations before the MSPB or the FLRA.  Aggrieved \nservice providers (like the NCLC) could claim breaches of \ncontract in the Court of Federal Claims.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1491.  \nAnd aggrieved consumers of services that the CFPB must \nprovide to the public (like the NAACP, NCLC, and VPLC) \ncould  file  APA  actions  alleging  that  the  service  has  been \nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(1).  Such challenges would target specific agency action \nor inaction that is alleged to be unlawful and to harm specific \nindividual plaintiffs.  And the courts, if they set aside the \nspecific action alleged to be unlawful, or compelled the specific \naction alleged to be unlawfully withheld, could redress the \nspecific injuries of individual plaintiffs. \nThis case is not constructed like that.  Instead, the plaintiffs \nseek to challenge what they describe as a single, overarching \ndecision to shut down the CFPB, which they infer from the \nvarious discrete actions noted above.  To remedy that asserted \ndecision, they seek pervasive judicial control over the day-to-\nday management of the agency, including decisions about how \nmany  employees  the  agency  may  terminate,  how  many \ncontracts it may cancel, how it may approve work, which \nbuildings it must occupy, and how employees will complete \nremote work.  Furthermore, the plaintiffs urge all this despite \nthe lack of any causal connection between many of the specific \nagency actions alleged to comprise the shutdown (for example, \nnot providing reports regarding credit cards) and the specific \ninjuries alleged by these plaintiffs (for example, Mr. Steege’s \nongoing difficulty in addressing his late wife’s student loans). \nAs we now explain, this challenge is not viable.  It cannot \nbe brought under the APA because that statute provides a cause \nof action to challenge discrete, final agency action, which the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 18 of 109\n18 \nclaims here do not target.  And it cannot be brought in equity \nbecause the claims here neither raise constitutional questions \nnor satisfy the stringent prerequisites for ultra vires review. \nV \nThe Administrative Procedure Act provides the standard \nmeans for obtaining judicial review of federal agency action.   \nYet the plaintiffs and the district court downplay it.  The district \ncourt treated the APA claims as an afterthought, warranting \ntwo short paragraphs of analysis after an exhaustive, 23-page \ndiscussion of what it described as non-APA “ultra vires and \nconstitutional claims.”  NTEU, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 55–78.  \nLikewise,  the  plaintiffs  lead  with  a  contention  that  the \nConstitution  itself  confers  an  implied  right  of  action  to \nchallenge  what  they  describe  as  separation-of-powers \nviolations.  The court and the plaintiffs have good reason to be \nskittish about the APA claims here. \nA \nThe APA cabins the timing, focus, and intensiveness of \njudicial  review  of  federal  agency  action.    It  requires  the \nplaintiff to target specific agency action that has caused him an \ninjury.  It requires that action to be final, ripe for review, and \ndiscrete.  And it does not permit the courts to superintend how \nan agency carries out its broad statutory responsibilities. \n1 \nBy its terms, the APA structures judicial review around \n“agency action” that harms the plaintiff and, unless another \nstatute provides otherwise, around such “final” agency action.  \nIt provides that a person “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency \naction within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 19 of 109\n19 \njudicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  It permits judicial review of \n“[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency \naction for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  \nId. § 704.  And it instructs reviewing courts to “compel agency \naction unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed” or to “set \naside agency action” that is arbitrary or otherwise unlawful.  Id. \n§ 706(1), (2).  The APA defines “agency action” to include “the \nwhole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, \nrelief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  Id. \n§ 551(13); see also id. § 701(b)(2) (same definition). \nTo be reviewable through the APA, agency action must be \nfinal and ripe for review.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (finality); Abbott \nLaboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967) (ripeness).  \nTo be final, agency action must “mark the consummation of \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process,” Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S. 154, 178 (1997) (cleaned up), and must impose “direct and \nappreciable legal consequences” on the plaintiff, Army Corps \nof Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 598 (2016) (quoting \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 178).  If an action affects the challenger’s \nrights  only  “on  the  contingency  of  future  administrative \naction,” it is not final.  DRG Funding Corp. v. Sec’y of Hous. \n& Urb. Dev., 76 F.3d 1212, 1214 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (quoting \nRochester  Tel.  Corp.  v.  United  States,  307  U.S.  125,  130 \n(1939)); see also Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 \n(1992) (action must “directly affect the parties”).  In assessing \nfinality,  we  evaluate  agency  action  relative  to  the \n“decisionmaking processes set out in [the] agency’s governing \nstatutes and regulations.”  Soundboard Ass’n v. FTC, 888 F.3d \n1261, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  And we may consider “post-\nguidance events to determine whether the agency has applied \nthe guidance as if it were binding on regulated parties.”  Nat’l \nMining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 253 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(Kavanaugh, J.).  The ripeness inquiry is similar:  “[It] requires \nus to consider ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial review and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 20 of 109\n20 \nthe hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  \nVillage of Bensenville v. FAA, 376 F.3d 1114, 1119 (D.C. Cir. \n2004) (quoting Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149).  An \naction is ripe for review only if it has caused, or threatens, \ndirect and immediate harm to the plaintiff.  Nat’l Ass’n of Home \nBuilders v. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 417 F.3d 1272, 1281, 1283 \n(D.C. Cir. 2005). \nTo  illustrate  these  principles,  consider  the  difference \nbetween a legislative rule and an agency plan.  A legislative \nrule is typically reviewable.  It is formally promulgated at the \nend of a defined process for the adoption of specific legal text.  \n5 U.S.C. § 553.  And it binds both the agency and regulated \nparties, who must conform their behavior to the rule or else face \nlegal penalties.  See Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 151 \n(regulated  parties);  United  States  ex  rel.  Accardi  v. \nShaughnessy,  347  U.S.  260,  267  (1954)  (agency).    These \ncharacteristics  often  make  legislative  rules  an  appropriate \ntarget for APA review, Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 150, \nunless the rule is unclear in its application or its immediate \neffects are modest, see Toilet Goods Ass’n v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S.  158,  164–65  (1967).    In  contrast,  an  agency  plan  is \nunreviewable insofar as it reflects only a nonbinding statement \nof something the agency intends to do in the future.  See Fund \nfor Animals, Inc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 18–22 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006).  Because such a plan has no immediate effect, \na plaintiff cannot challenge the plan itself but instead must \nawait further agency actions implementing it.  See id. at 22.  \nFinality  and  ripeness  standards  are  flexible,  so  informal \nguidance  documents  sometimes  are  reviewable.    See  Cal. \nCmtys. Against Toxics v. EPA, 934 F.3d 627, 634–36 (D.C. Cir. \n2019).  But to be reviewable, such items must impose standards \nthat the agency treats as binding.  See, e.g., id. at 638–40; Nat’l \nMining Ass’n, 758 F.3d at 252 (“The most important factor \nconcerns the actual legal effect (or lack thereof) of the agency \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 21 of 109\n21 \naction in question on regulated entities.”); Nat’l Env’t Dev. \nAss’n’s Clean Air Project v. EPA, 752 F.3d 999, 1007 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (internal directive “provide[d] firm guidance” that \nenforcement officials “relied on”). \n2 \nIn Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871 \n(1990), the Supreme Court held that “agency action” under the \nAPA must also be “specific.”  See id. at 894.  The plaintiffs \nthere alleged that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \nmade various land-use decisions that violated the governing \nstatutes.  See id. at 879.  Rather than challenge any of these \nactions individually, the plaintiffs sought to challenge all of \nthem together, grouped under what they described as a “land \nwithdrawal  review  program.”    Id.  at  890.    Rejecting  the \nchallenge, the Supreme Court held that the APA requires a \nplaintiff to “direct its attack against some particular ‘agency \naction’ that causes it harm.”  Id. at 891 (emphasis added).  The \nCourt reasoned that the “land withdrawal review program” was \nnot “derived from any authoritative text” in the governing \nstatutes or regulations and did not “refer to a single BLM order \nor regulation, or even to a completed universe of particular \nBLM orders and regulations.”  Id. at 890.  Instead, it was \nsimply  shorthand  for  the  “continuing  (and  thus  constantly \nchanging) operations of the BLM” in administering public \nlands,  and  was  no  more  a  “final  agency  action”  than  “a \n‘weapons procurement program’ of the Department of Defense \nor a ‘drug interdiction program’ of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration,”  neither  of  which  would  themselves  be \nreviewable.  Id.  The Court stressed that any “flaws in the entire \n‘program’—consisting  principally  of  the  many  individual \nactions referenced in the complaint, and presumably action yet \nto  be  taken  as  well—cannot  be  laid  before  the  courts  for \nwholesale correction under the APA, simply because one of \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 22 of 109\n22 \nthem that is ripe for review adversely  affects” one of the \nplaintiffs.  Id. at 893.  To the contrary, the APA requires a \n“case-by-case  approach”  targeting  “specific  ‘final  agency \naction,’”  rather  than  “more  sweeping  actions”  seeking \n“systemic improvement” at a “higher level of generality.”  Id. \nat 894; see also id. at 891 (APA does not authorize courts to \nconsider  “wholesale  improvement”  or  “programmatic \nimprovements” in agency administration). \nNorton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55 \n(2004) (SUWA), elaborated on these principles in the context \nof APA actions under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) to “compel agency \naction unlawfully withheld.”  The Court made clear that the \nwithheld action must be a “circumscribed, discrete agency \naction[],” 542 U.S. at 62, which “precludes the kind of broad \nprogrammatic attack” rejected in National Wildlife, id. at 64.  \nAnd  consistent  with  traditional  mandamus  standards,  the \ncompelled action must also be one that the agency is “legally \nrequired” to take, id. at 63, which “rules out judicial direction \nof even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law,” \nid. at 65.  Combining both principles, “a claim under § 706(1) \ncan proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed \nto take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.”  Id. \nat 64.  SUWA involved a statute requiring the BLM to manage \ncertain lands “in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of \nsuch  areas  for  preservation  as  wilderness.”    43  U.S.C. \n§ 1782(c).  The Court described this statute as “mandatory as \nto the object to be achieved,” but still leaving the agency “a \ngreat deal of discretion in deciding how to achieve it.”  542 \nU.S. at 66.  The plaintiffs contended that BLM was violating \nthe statute.  Id. at 65.  But instead of identifying any discrete \naction  that  BLM  allegedly  was  taking  or  withholding \nunlawfully, they sought an order simply compelling BLM to \ncomply with  the non-impairment mandate.   See id.  at  66.  \nRejecting that claim, the Court explained that the APA does not \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 23 of 109\n23 \nauthorize  general  orders  compelling  compliance  with  such \n“broad statutory mandates.”  Id.  Orders like that would require \nthe courts, in determining whether “compliance was achieved,” \nto become enmeshed in “day-to-day agency management.”  Id. \nat 66–67.  And the APA does not permit “pervasive oversight \nby  federal  courts  over  the  manner  and  pace  of  agency \ncompliance with such congressional directives.”  Id. at 67. \nIn Fund for Animals, this Court held that National Wildlife \nand SUWA barred APA review of a BLM “plan” to achieve a \nmandatory statutory goal of protecting wild horses.  See 460 \nF.3d at 15, 20–22.  The “plan” consisted of “many individual \nactions,” some of which were not themselves legally required.  \nSee id. at 20–21 (cleaned up).  For such general plans, we \nconcluded, “it is only specific actions implementing the plans \nthat are subject to judicial scrutiny.”  Id. at 21; see also City of \nNew York v. DoD, 913 F.3d 423, 432 (4th Cir. 2019) (National \nWildlife and SUWA limit review to “only those acts that are \nspecific  enough  to  avoid  entangling  the  judiciary  in \nprogrammatic oversight, clear enough to avoid substituting \njudicial  judgments  for  those  of  the  executive  branch,  and \nsubstantial enough to prevent an incursion into internal agency \nmanagement”). \n*   *   *   * \nThese requirements—agency action, finality, ripeness, and \ndiscreteness—reflect  that  the  APA  does  not  make  federal \ncourts “roving commissions” assigned to pass on how well \nfederal  agencies  are  satisfying  their  statutory  obligations.  \nBroadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610–11 (1973).  Rather, \na court may intervene only when a specific unlawful action \nharms the plaintiff, and only to the extent necessary to set aside \nthat action.  By avoiding premature adjudication and narrowing \nthe  scope  of  judicial  review,  these  requirements  “protect \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 24 of 109\n24 \nagencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful \ndiscretion[] and … avoid judicial entanglement in  abstract \npolicy disagreements which courts lack both expertise and \ninformation to resolve.”  SUWA, 542 U.S. at 66.4 \nB \nThe plaintiffs here complain about a slew of different \nCFPB “actions” that include “issuing stop-work instructions, \ncancelling contracts, declining and returning funding, firing \nemployees, and terminating the lease for its headquarters.”  \nJ.A. 46–47.  But they point to only two actions that allegedly \nsatisfy the finality,  ripeness,  and discreteness  requirements \nsummarized above.  One of them is an email asking employees \nto obtain approval before performing work.  Another is an \n \n4  Two other APA limitations reinforce these points.  First, APA \nreview normally is based on an administrative record, obviating the \nneed for intrusive discovery into internal agency processes.  See, e.g., \nVermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 549 \n(1978); Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142–43 (1973) (per curiam).  \nThat limit is inconsistent with a focus on putative agency action that \nrequires a multi-day evidentiary hearing just to identify.  Second, \nonce the reviewing court corrects a discrete legal error, it normally \nmust remand rather than retain jurisdiction to implement a complex \nremedial decree.  See, e.g., Calcutt v. FDIC, 598 U.S. 623, 629 \n(2023) (“the function of the reviewing court ends when an error of \nlaw is laid bare” (quoting FPC v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U.S. 17, 20 \n(1952))).  That limit is inconsistent with programmatic review of \nbroad agency management. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 25 of 109\n25 \nasserted decision, inferred from the various discrete actions \nmentioned, to shut down the Bureau.  \n1 \nOn February 10, the Acting Director of the CFPB emailed \nagency staff.  In its entirety, the email stated: \nAs you have been informed by the Chief Operating \nOfficer  in  an  email  yesterday,  the  Bureau’s  DC \nheadquarters building is closed this week.  Employees \nshould not come into the office.  Please do not perform \nany work tasks.  If there are any urgent matters, please \nalert me through Mark Paoletta, Chief Legal Officer, \nto get approval in writing before performing any work \ntask.  His email is [redacted].  Otherwise, employees \nshould stand down from performing any work task.  \nThank you for your attention on this matter.  \nJ.A. 101. \nThis email does not qualify as final agency action.  To \nbegin with, it did not mark the consummation of any agency \ndecision-making  process,  much  less  a  defined  process  for \nrulemaking, adjudication, or anything equivalent.  The email \nwas not formally promulgated, much less published in the Code \nof Federal Regulations, the Federal Register, or any official \nagency records.  In context, it reflected a new presidential \nAdministration and a new Acting Director trying to assess all \nagency activities.  And it linked the prior-approval requirement \nto a short-term exigency requiring the temporary closure of \nagency headquarters.  Most importantly, the email did not \ndefinitively  decide  anything.    Instead,  it  merely  directed \nemployees to obtain advance approval before performing work, \nwhile remaining silent on legally mandated work and leaving \nthe Chief Legal Officer with discretion to approve it. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 26 of 109\n26 \nLikewise,  the  email  triggered  no  appreciable  legal \nconsequences for employees, contractors, regulated parties, or \nmembers of the public.  It neither terminated any employees \nnor cancelled any contracts.  It did not purport to prohibit any \nstatutorily required tasks.  Because the Chief Legal Officer did \napprove many tasks upon request, it is difficult to see how the \nemail affected the plaintiffs even practically, much less how it \ndirectly changed their legal rights.  See note 1, supra.  Finally, \nless than three weeks after that email, the Chief Legal Officer \nsent  another  email  clarifying  that  “[e]mployees  should  be \nperforming work that is required by law and do not need to seek \nprior approval to do so.”  J.A. 387.  So the February 10 email \nby its terms did not require legally mandatory work to be \nabandoned, and the CFPB did not apply the email “as if it were \nbinding” on that question.  See Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 758 F.3d at \n253. \nThe plaintiffs note that staff directives and other informal \nkinds of agency action are sometimes reviewable under the \nAPA.  That is true, but only if the agency treats the action as \nbinding,  and  only  if  the  action  has  appreciable  legal \nconsequences for the plaintiff.  See Cal. Cmtys. Against Toxics, \n934 F.3d at 638–40; Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 758 F.3d at 252.  The \nauthorities cited by the plaintiffs confirm as much.  The internal \ndirective in National Environmental Development Association \n“provide[d]  firm  guidance  to  enforcement  officials,”  who \n“relied on” it in making permitting decisions throughout the \ncountry.  See 752 F.3d at 1007.  Likewise, the letter in Ciba-\nGeigy Corp. v. EPA, 801 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1986), informed \na regulated party of the agency’s considered view that the party \nhad no right to a hearing it desired.  See id. at 436–38.  The \nFebruary 10 email, in requiring advance approval to perform \nwork, does nothing so firm or consequential. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 27 of 109\n27 \n2 \nWe turn next to the putative shutdown decision.  The \nplaintiffs point to no regulation, order, document, email, or \nother statement, written or oral, purporting to shut down the \nCFPB.  Instead, they infer such an overarching decision from \nvarious  discrete  “actions”  taken  by  agency  leadership  to \ndownsize  the  Bureau,  “including  by  issuing  stop-work \ninstructions,  cancelling  contracts,  declining  and  returning \nfunding, firing employees, and terminating the lease for its \nheadquarters.”  J.A. 46–47.  The district court found a “decision \nto  shut  down the  agency  completely”  and  equated  it  to  a \n“wholesale cessation” of CFPB activities.  NTEU, 774 F. Supp. \n3d at 46. \nFor its part, the government does not claim the power to \n“shut down” the CFPB.  Nor could it.  Congressional statutes \ncreate the Bureau and define its powers and duties.  Agency \nofficials  cannot  wipe  those  provisions  off  the  books.  \nMoreover,  as  explained  above,  many  CFPB  functions  are \nmandatory; for example, the Bureau must respond to consumer \ncomplaints, disseminate various reports, and assist individuals \nwith student loans.  The agency does not suggest that it could \nlawfully abandon these various responsibilities.  Finally, while \nthe  Bureau’s  rulemaking,  enforcement,  and  adjudicatory \npowers are discretionary, we assume that it must engage in \nsome  regulation  of,  say,  the  Nation’s  largest  banks.    See \nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 833 n.4 (1985). \nInstead, the government disputes that it undertook to shut \ndown the CFPB.  First, it contends that agency leadership at all \ntimes intended for the Bureau to remain open and to perform \nall of its statutorily required functions.  Second, it contends that \nno decision to shut down the Bureau was ever reduced to final, \nreviewable agency action.  Questions of what CFPB leadership \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 28 of 109\n28 \nwanted or intended to do at any particular point in time are \nfactual, and we are reluctant to conclude that the district court’s \nfactual assessments were clearly erroneous.  But the question \nof what counts as final agency action reviewable under the \nAPA is a legal one, which we decide without deference to the \ndistrict court.  See, e.g., Soundboard Ass’n, 888 F.3d at 1267–\n74; Nat’l Mining, 758 F.3d at 250–53.  On that question, we \nagree  with  the  government  that  there  was  no  reviewable \ndecision to shut down the CFPB. \n First, the APA does not authorize review of “abstract \ndecision[s] apart from specific agency action, as defined in the \nAPA.”  Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 809 (2022).  In Biden v. \nTexas, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a June 1, \n2021  memorandum  “officially  terminating”  a  discretionary \nimmigration  program  known  as  the  Migrant  Protection \nProtocols.    See  id.  at  793.    After  a  court  set  aside  that \ntermination  and  remanded  for  further  consideration,  the \nSecretary again formally terminated the program on October \n29, 2021, this time with some forty pages of reasoning.  See id. \nat 795–96.  The court of appeals treated the second termination \nnot as a separately reviewable agency action, but as a mere \n“post  hoc  rationalization[]”  for  what  it  described  as  a \n“Termination  Decision”  independent  of    the  June  1  and \nOctober 29 memoranda.  See id. at 796–97, 809–10.  The \nSupreme Court reversed.  Quoting from the APA’s definition \nof a “rule,” it held that the court of appeals had erred “by \npostulating the existence of an agency decision wholly apart \nfrom  any  ‘agency  statement  of  general  or  particular \napplicability … designed to implement’ that decision.”  Id. at \n809 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(4)). \n Here, too, there is no such “action” as defined in the \nAPA—i.e., no such “rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the \nequivalent  or  denial  thereof,  or  failure  to  act,”  5  U.S.C. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 29 of 109\n29 \n§ 551(13).  The plaintiffs suggest that the putative shutdown \ndecision qualifies as a rule, which would require some “agency \nstatement” designed “to implement, interpret, or prescribe law \nor policy.”  Id. § 551(4) (emphasis added).  The plaintiffs point \nto no such statement, formal or informal, written or oral.  Nor \ndo they suggest that the putative shutdown decision is anything \nlike an “order, license, sanction, [or] relief.”  These too are \ndefined terms, see id. § 551(6), (8), (10), (11), and a decision \nto shut down an agency would not satisfy any of the definitions.  \nIn  sum,  the  shutdown  decision  posited  here,  like  the \nTermination Decision posited in Biden v. Texas, is an abstract \ndecision “wholly apart from” any “specific agency action, as \ndefined in the APA.”  597 U.S. at 809.5 \n \n5  The dissent  responds that section 551(13)’s definition of \n“agency action” encompasses “comprehensively every manner in \nwhich an agency may exercise its power.”  Post at 22, 45 (quoting \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001)).  But \nAmerican Trucking involved only a question about finality, not \nwhether there was “agency action” to begin with.  See 531 U.S. at \n478–79.  Moreover, in SUWA, the Court looked to the specific \ndefined terms embedded in section 551(13)—“rule, order, license, \nsanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof”—to limit the \nscope of what counts as “agency action” under the APA.  See 542 \nU.S. at 62–63.  Likewise, in Biden v. Texas, the Court looked to the \nspecific  definition of an APA “rule”—an  “agency statement of \ngeneral or particular applicability … designed to implement” a \ndecision—to hold that an alleged abstract decision to terminate an \nagency program, distinct from the one announced by memorandum, \nwas not “agency action” under the APA.  See 597 U.S. at 809–10.  \nWe too “have long recognized that the term [agency action] is not so \nall-encompassing as to authorize us to exercise judicial review over \neverything  done  by  an  administrative  agency.”   Indep.  Equip. \nDealers Ass’n v. EPA, 372 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (cleaned \nup).  For example, agencies do many things “in anticipation of” \ntaking “agency action,” such as making budget requests.  Fund for \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 30 of 109\n30 \nSecond,  the  putative  shutdown  decision  was  not  final \nagency  action.    No  such  decision  by  itself  effected  the \ntermination  of  any  employees  or  the  cancellation  of  any \ncontracts.  To the contrary, as the CFPB attempted to downsize, \nit had to undertake separate, discrete actions to lay off workers \nand  cancel  contracts—actions  that,  had  they  not  been \npreliminarily enjoined, would have been reviewable in the \nMSPB or the Court of Federal Claims.  Nor did the posited \nshutdown prohibit any legally required work.  As explained \nabove,  CFPB  transitional  leadership  made  a  handful  of \nstatements addressing what work employees could do during \nthe initial days of the new presidential Administration.  While \nthese statements all required prior approval to perform work, \nthree of them expressly excepted legally required work, J.A. \n110 (Bessent on Feb. 3); id. at 117 (Vought on Feb. 8); id. at \n387  (Paoletta  on  Mar.  2),  while  one  of  them  expressly \nempowered the Chief Legal Officer to approve work, id. at 101 \n(Vought on Feb. 10).  And the Chief Legal Officer did, in fact, \n \nAnimals, Inc., 460 F.3d at 19–20.  A budget request “may serve as a \nuseful planning document, but it is not a ‘rule,’” id. at 20, because it \nis not a “statement … designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe \nlaw or policy,” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).  Neither are an agency director’s \nnon-public, unrecorded decisions. \nThe dissent further contends that the Acting Director’s alleged \nunrecorded decision to shut down the Bureau was “the equivalent” \nof a rule.  Post at 43–44 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(13)).  But again, a \n“rule” is  an  “agency  statement.”   5 U.S.C. § 551(4) (emphasis \nadded).  A “statement” is something that one says or writes, usually \nto make something known to others.  See Statement, Webster’s New \nInternational Dictionary of the English Language (2d ed. 1945) (“Act \nof stating, reciting, or presenting, orally or on paper”); Present, \nWebster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language (2d \ned. 1945) (“to bring to anyone’s attention or cognizance … to show; \ndisplay;  set  forth;  describe”).   Unexpressed  decisions  are  the \nopposite of, not something “equivalent” to, such a “statement.” \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 31 of 109\n31 \napprove much legally required work.  So there was neither a \ndefinitive agency decision to stop mandatory work nor a direct \nand appreciable impact on the rights of the plaintiffs. \nThird,  the  posited  shutdown  decision  is  insufficiently \ndiscrete to qualify as “agency action.”  To begin with, no statute \nor regulation authorizes the CFPB to shut itself down, so the \nposited decision is not “derived from any authoritative text” \nthat might help structure judicial review.  See Nat’l Wildlife \nFed’n,  497  U.S.  at  890.    Nor  does  the  posited  shutdown \ndecision “refer to a single [CFPB] order or regulation, or even \nto  a  completed  universe  of  particular  [CFPB]  orders  and \nregulations.”  See id.  Instead, it is the plaintiffs’ way of \nreferring  to  a  constellation  of  then-ongoing  actions—the \nFebruary  10  email,  firing  employees,  cancelling  contracts, \ndeclining additional funding, and terminating the lease for the \nBureau’s  current  headquarters.    Rather  than  seeking  to \nchallenge any of these discrete decisions that may have caused \nthem  harm,  the  plaintiffs  seek  to  dress  up  these  “many \nindividual actions” as a single decision in order to challenge all \nof  them  at  once,  which  is  exactly  what  National  Wildlife \nprevents.  See id. at 893. \nFourth, the discreteness problem is made worse by the \nopen-ended nature of the legal duties that the plaintiffs seek to \nenforce.  Essentially, they seek an order compelling the CFPB \nto keep providing its mandatory services.  See Oral Arg. Tr. \n48–50  (proposing  injunction  barring  the  government  from \n“try[ing] to shut down the agency”).  But while the statute \nspecifies various services that the Bureau must provide, it gives \nthe agency “a great deal of discretion in deciding how” to \nprovide them.  SUWA, 542 U.S. at 66 (emphasis added).  For \nexample, how many employees must the Bureau have to ensure \nadequately  functioning  offices  to  process  consumer \ncomplaints,  disseminate  reports,  and  afford  student-loan \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 32 of 109\n32 \nassistance?  Which contracts are essential for achieving those \nobjectives?  How much funding is necessary for doing so?  \nCongress gave the Bureau discretion to make decisions like \nthese.  See 12 U.S.C. § 5493(a)(1)(A) (“The Director may fix \nthe number of … employees of the Bureau.”); id. § 5497(a)(1) \n(Director shall determine the funding “reasonably necessary to \ncarry out the authorities of the Bureau”).  An order requiring \nthe  Bureau  to  retain  specified  levels  of  employment, \ncontracting, funding, and the like would run afoul of SUWA’s \nprohibition of “judicial direction of even discrete agency action \nthat is not demanded by law.”  542 U.S. at 65.  And any \n“general” order merely “compelling compliance with broad \nstatutory  mandates”  would  present  essentially  the  same \nproblem:  The courts “would necessarily be empowered” to \n“determine whether compliance was achieved—which would \nmean  that  it  would  ultimately  become  the  task  of  the \nsupervising  court,  rather  than  the  agency,  to  work  out \ncompliance with the broad statutory mandate, injecting the \njudge into day-to-day agency management.”  Id. at 66–67. \nWe  faced  exactly  this  problem  in  considering  the \ngovernment’s motion for a stay pending appeal.  Because the \ngovernment then challenged only the scope of the preliminary \ninjunction, we were presented with a dilemma that proved \ninsoluble:    Enjoin  specific  activity  like  the  termination  of \nagency employees, as the preliminary injunction had done, \nwhich would restrict a wide range of activity that the agency \nmay lawfully undertake.  Or, alternatively, craft a follow-the-\nlaw  injunction  requiring  the  Bureau  to  retain  enough \nemployees to meet its statutory obligations.  Our partial stay \norder tried the latter course, and it immediately embroiled the \ncourts in compliance issues about how many employees were \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 33 of 109\n33 \nnecessary—a determination that the Judicial Branch is neither \nauthorized nor competent to make.6 \nFinally, the challenge to the posited shutdown decision is \nunripe.  For starters, the issues are not fit for review.  As \nexplained above, the plaintiffs point to no definitive statement \nregarding an agency shutdown but seek to infer one from \nvarious specific acts to downsize.  Because the exact scope of \nthe putative shutdown is thus unclear, judicial review “is likely \nto stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific \napplication.”  Toilet Goods Ass’n, 387 U.S. at 164.  Moreover, \nagency  consideration  remained  ongoing,  which  means  that \n“judicial  intervention  would  inappropriately  interfere  with \nfurther administrative action.”  Ohio Forestry Ass’n. v. Sierra \nClub, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998); see also Texas v. United \nStates, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (“A claim is not ripe for \nadjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may \nnot occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” \n(cleaned up)).  Even if we assume, as the district court found, \nthat interim CFPB leadership at one point made an abstract \n \n6  The dissent contends that SUWA has “little to say regarding \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ section 706(2) challenge” to set  aside agency \naction because SUWA “is a section 706(1) case” to compel agency \naction.  Post at 35.  But SUWA’s analysis turned on the fact that \nsection 706(1) “insist[s] upon an ‘agency action,’” 542 U.S. at 62, as \ndoes section 706(2).  Moreover, SUWA expressly built on National \nWildlife, which construed the phrase “agency action” in a section \n706(2) case.  See id. at 64–65.  And SUWA’s concerns about overly \nintrusive APA remedies do not fall away merely because a plaintiff \nsues under section 706(2).  See id. at 67 (“The prospect of pervasive \noversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency \ncompliance with such congressional directives is not contemplated \nby the APA.” (emphasis added)).  The concerns apply equally here, \nwhere the plaintiffs ask us to enjoin the Bureau’s putative decision \nnot to meet its statutory responsibilities by issuing what is, in effect, \na general order compelling the agency to meet them. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 34 of 109\n34 \ndecision to shut down the Bureau, see NTEU, 774 F. Supp. 3d \nat 58–69, this decision was not final.  Instead, the leadership \nhad  an  opportunity  to  change  course  before  the  decision \nresulted in the denial of any service.  And the Bureau did \nchange course—it has reactivated certain contracts, J.A. 663; \nrefined its RIF plans, id. at 758; and issued a directive to \n“ensure that everyone is carrying out any statutorily required \nwork,”  id.  at  387.    Under  these  circumstances,  immediate \njudicial review would deny the Bureau “an opportunity to \ncorrect its own mistakes.”  FTC v. Standard Oil Co., 449 U.S. \n232, 242 (1980).  In sum, regularly moving targets do not raise \nissues fit for review. 7 \nMoreover, the plaintiffs will suffer no unusual hardship \nfrom  postponing  review.    Unlike  in  cases  allowing  pre-\nenforcement review, the actions challenged here do not require \nthem “to engage in, or to refrain from, any conduct.”  Texas v. \nUnited States, 523 U.S. at 301.  And if their fears come to pass, \nthey may “protect all of their rights and claims by returning to \ncourt when the controversy ripens.”  Atl. States Legal Found. \nv. EPA, 325 F.3d 281, 285 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Specifically, they \n \n7  The dissent dismisses the change in course as “whitewashing” \nand asserts that it goes only to mootness.  Post at 31–32.  But the \nActing Director’s speedy renunciation of any intent to shut down the \nBureau, backed with concrete action, bears directly on whether there \nwas a final shutdown decision to begin with.  As explained above, \nwe routinely consider shifting “post-guidance events” to determine \nwhether an agency  treats any  informal guidance “as if it were \nbinding.”  Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 758 F.3d at 253.  Moreover, a central \npurpose of prudential ripeness doctrine is to allow an agency space \nto “alter a tentative position.”  Pub. Citizen Health Rsch. Grp. v. \nFDA, 740 F.2d 21, 31 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see also Ohio Forestry Ass’n, \n523 U.S. at 735.  If the Bureau’s change in course here—before any \nplaintiff was denied any statutorily required service—went only to \nmootness, then the ripeness doctrine would be futile. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 35 of 109\n35 \nmay seek judicial review to “compel agency action unlawfully \nwithheld or unreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  In such \nsuits, they would have to wait until the Bureau actually denied \nthem  a  discrete  service—and  show  either  an  immediate \nentitlement to it or an unreasonable delay in providing it.  See \nTelecomms. Rsch. & Action Ctr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 80 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  This is not a hardship; it is par for the course, even \nin cases where plaintiffs’ lives and livelihoods depend on the \nprompt receipt of agency services.  See, e.g., Afghan & Iraqi \nAllies v. Blinken, 103 F.4th 807, 810 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (delay in \nthe provision of “special-immigrant visas to certain Iraqi and \nAfghan nationals who face serious threats because of their \nfaithful service to the United States”). \n3 \nThe plaintiffs respond by citing cases where unwritten \naction,  agency  plans,  and  decisions  to  terminate  agency \nprograms were held reviewable under the APA.  They also seek \nto distinguish National Wildlife and SUWA.  But the cited cases \nare inapposite, and the asserted distinctions fail. \nUnwritten action.  Cases involving final agency action not \ncommitted to writing are few and far between.  The plaintiffs \ncite two.  The first, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and \nTrainmen v. FRA, 972 F.3d 83 (D.C. Cir. 2020), is entirely \ninapposite.    It  involved  a  regulatory  scheme  in  which  an \nagency’s failure to act on a license application within a certain \nnumber of days constituted an approval by operation of law.  \nId. at 89–90.  Approval of a license is final agency action, \nwhether committed to writing or not.  Id. at 90; see 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(8), (13).  Even so, we pointed to the application itself as \na “relevant written document” that would make clear exactly \nwhat the agency had approved.  See 972 F.3d at 100–01. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 36 of 109\n36 \nThe second case, Venetian Casino Resort, LLC v. EEOC, \n530 F.3d 925 (D.C. Cir. 2008), involved an EEOC policy \nallowing  the  agency  to  disclose  confidential  information \nwithout prior notice to the submitter.  Id. at 929–30.  The parties \ndisputed which version of a written compliance manual setting \nforth the policy was operative, but the district court found the \nversions to be “identical in all material aspects,” and neither \nparty contested that finding on appeal.  See id. at 928–30.  \nMoreover, each version left “no doubt” that EEOC permitted \ndisclosure without prior notice, and the agency conceded as \nmuch.  See id.  An employer who had submitted confidential \ninformation sued to enjoin EEOC from relying on the policy to \ndisclose its information.  EEOC objected that promulgating the \nmanual was not final agency action because the manual was \n“merely a guidance document that d[id] not affect its own or \nthe  public’s  legal  obligations.”    Id.  at  931.    This  Court \nresponded that “the agency took final action by adopting the \npolicy, not by including it in the Manual.”  Id.  We further noted \nthat the policy was ripe for review because EEOC was on the \ncusp of applying it to harm the plaintiff.  See id. at 927–28.   \nOn the plaintiffs’ telling, Venetian Casino stands for the \nproposition  that  the  APA  permits  review  of  agencies’ \nunrecorded abstract decisions.  But the policy at issue there was \nrecorded  repeatedly,  in  different  versions  of  an  agency \ncompliance manual.  Its terms were clear from the manual and \nmaterially identical in both versions.  See 530 F.3d at 929.  \nMoreover, the manual was disseminated to agency employees \nprecisely to guide their decisions.  See id. at 928–29.  So, \nstatements in the manual qualified as a rule, see 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(13), which was final because the agency treated them as \nbinding.  See, e.g., Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 758 F.3d at 253; Nat’l \nEnv’t Dev. Ass’n’s Clean Air Project, 752 F.3d at 1007.  None \nof this suggests that the unrecorded shutdown decision at issue \nhere, which was expressed in no agency statement, qualifies as \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 37 of 109\n37 \na  rule.    To  the  contrary,  courts  cannot  “postulat[e]  the \nexistence” of a rule “wholly apart from” any agency statement \nor its equivalent.  See Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. at 809.  And \nespecially so, as the dissent acknowledges, post at 41, when the \nagency has reduced the policy to writing, as it did in Venetian \nCasino.  In any event, we reviewed the policy at issue there \nonly because the agency was about to apply it to harm the \nplaintiff,  so  the  policy  implicated  none  of  the  finality  or \nripeness concerns associated with the shutdown decision here. \nAgency plans.  As explained above, agency plans generally \nare  not  final  because  they  contemplate  “specific  actions \nimplementing the plans.”  Fund for Animals, 460 F.3d at 21.  \nBut there are exceptions—some plans are made reviewable by \nstatute, see 5 U.S.C. § 704, and others are final because a \nstatute gives them some binding effect.  The plaintiffs cite \ncases involving such plans.  See Marin Audubon Soc’y v. FAA, \n121 F.4th 902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (plan made reviewable by \nstatute); Defs. of Wildlife v. Salazar, 651 F.3d 112, 113 (D.C. \nCir.  2011)  (plan  made  binding  by  statute);  Senior  Res.  v. \nJackson, 412 F.3d 112, 115 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (same).  These \ncases are inapposite, for no statute made the CFPB’s putative \nshutdown decision binding or otherwise reviewable. \nProgram terminations.   Finally,  the plaintiffs  point to \ncases reviewing  decisions to  terminate agency programs—\nmost notably DHS v. Regents of the University of California, \n591 U.S. 1 (2020), and Biden v. Texas.  These cases prove that \nsuch decisions can be final agency action.  But neither one \nsuggests that the CFPB took final agency action here. \nRegents involved Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n(DACA), “a program for conferring affirmative immigration \nrelief” on certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States.  \n591 U.S. at 18.  DACA entitled qualifying aliens to apply for \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 38 of 109\n38 \ndeferred action—a status enabling the alien to remain in the \nUnited States, to work here, and to receive government benefits \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare.  See id. at 10.  Following \na change in presidential administrations, the Acting Secretary \nof  Homeland  Security  issued  a  written  memorandum \nrescinding DACA.  See id. at 12–13.  The government argued \nthat  the  memorandum  was  unreviewable  because  it  was \ncommitted to agency discretion by law; the government never \nsuggested that the memorandum, self-executing on its face and \nformally published by an acting Cabinet Secretary, was not \nfinal agency action.  See id. at 17–19.  Still, the Supreme Court \nstressed that the memorandum “provide[d] a focus for judicial \nreview.”  Id. at 18 (cleaned up). \nBiden v. Texas involved the Migrant Protection Protocols, \nwhich required certain aliens entering the country from Mexico \nto be returned to Mexico pending resolution of their removal \nproceedings.    597  U.S.  at  791.    Following  a  change  in \npresidential administrations, the Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity  issued  a  self-executing,  written  memorandum \nformally ending the program.  See id. at 808 (“I am hereby \nterminating  MPP.”).    The  Supreme  Court  held  that  the \nmemorandum was final agency action because it “marked the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process and \nresulted  in  rights  or  obligations  being  determined.”    Id. \n(cleaned up).  Specifically, the memorandum “bound DHS staff \nby  forbidding  them  to  continue  the  program  in  any  way \nfrom that moment on.”  Id. at 808–09 (cleaned up). \nIn short, reviewability in these cases did not turn on the \nfact that program terminations were at issue; it turned on the \nfact that the plaintiffs challenged final, written memoranda \nwith formal legal consequence.  Moreover, the Court in Biden \nv. Texas made clear that it was reviewing the formal memo \nitself, not any “abstract” termination decision “wholly apart \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 39 of 109\n39 \nfrom” that final rule.  597 U.S. at 809.  Here, in contrast, the \nplaintiffs seek to challenge an unrecorded decision that neither \nbinds agency staff nor restricts access to agency benefits.8 \nDiscreteness  precedents.    The  plaintiffs’  attempts  to \ndistinguish National Wildlife and SUWA also fall flat.  The \nplaintiffs contend that the challengers in  National  Wildlife \nsought to contest “thousands” of decisions, whereas they seek \nto challenge only “a single plan to shut down the agency.”  Red \nBr. 35.  But on the plaintiffs’ own account, that asserted plan \nimplicates  hundreds  of  distinct  contract  and  personnel \ndecisions.  See, e.g., J.A. 648–49.  And in any event, National \nWildlife held that an APA challenge may not bundle together \ndiscrete actions in order to challenge them all together.  See 497 \nU.S. at 890–94.  Here, the plaintiffs equate all of the individual \n“actions to suspend or terminate CFPB’s statutorily mandated \nactivities—including  by  issuing  stop-work  instructions, \ncancelling contracts, declining and returning funding, firing \nemployees, and terminating the lease” with the “final agency \naction”—in the singular—reviewable under the APA.  J.A. 46–\n47.  As for SUWA, the plaintiffs contend it is inapplicable \nbecause they seek to set aside an unlawful shutdown decision, \n \n8  The dissent suggests that our analysis would permit the \ngovernment to terminate programs by “conceal[ing] … what it is \ndoing.”  Post at 43; see also id. at 51 (positing action that “agencies \nmanage to obfuscate”).  But programs afford benefits, which the \ngovernment could not rescind without some kind of public statement.  \nIf the denial of some benefit were judicially reviewable while the \nrelevant program remained in effect, it would also be reviewable—\nand would surely be set aside—if the government invoked a secret \ntermination decision as the basis for the denial.  Moreover, if the \ngovernment sought to implement a secret termination by simply \nrefusing to provide benefits, or to act on applications for benefits, \ncourts could compel those actions under section 706(1), as we have \nexplained. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 40 of 109\n40 \nnot to compel mandatory agency operations.  But the same \nanalysis of “agency action” governs both suits to set aside \nunlawful action under section 706(2) and suits to compel action \nunlawfully withheld under section 706(1).  See SUWA, 542 \nU.S. at 64–65.  And despite the plaintiffs’ disclaimer, they \nsought and obtained a preliminary injunction ordering all kinds \nof agency actions that were not themselves legally required, \nsuch as a prohibition on conducting any RIFs. \n4 \nThe dissent asks us to imagine that the Acting Director had \nissued  a  “formal  written  memorandum”  announcing  the \ntermination of the CFPB.  Post at 23.  The dissent argues that, \nbecause  such  a  hypothetical  memorandum  would  be \nreviewable, the shutdown decision inferred here must also be \nreviewable.  See id. at 39–42. \n One can easily imagine a shutdown memorandum that \nwould be reviewable.  Suppose the Acting Director had issued \nthis edict:  “The Bureau is shut down.  Effective immediately, \nBureau employees may not perform any work.”  This memo \nwould be a rule—that is, “an agency statement … designed to \nimplement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(4).  And it would be final, reflecting the Bureau’s firm \ndecision to take an action with tangible legal consequences, \nnamely refusing to provide services as required by Congress.  \nSee Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. at 808–09.  In effect, the memo \nwould operate like a legislative rule eliminating services that \nthe agency was required to provide.  And because the memo \nwould  have  tangible  legal  consequences,  a  court  could \nmeaningfully set  it aside, restoring  the Bureau’s ability to \nperform mandatory services and, in so doing, redressing the \ninjuries of individuals who use the agency services.  In other \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 41 of 109\n41 \nwords, the reviewing court could undo the legal consequence \nimposed by the memo. \nBut it hardly follows that the APA permits review of an \nunrecorded rule—the existence of which the agency denies— \ninferred from a collection of disparate agency actions.  The \ndissent cites no case in which any court reviewed a putative \nrule that the agency denied having promulgated.  And the very \nnotion of an unrecorded rule is almost oxymoronic.  Agencies \npromulgate rules to alter legal relationships, which is why rules \nare often subject to pre-enforcement review.  See, e.g., Abbott \nLaboratories, 387 U.S. at 152.  It is difficult to see how an \nagency could accomplish that through a secret decision not \nmemorialized in any public statement, written or oral. \nIn any event, our analysis does not hinge on the absence of \na memorandum alone.  Even if there were a memo, it would \nnot be reviewable unless it bound the agency.  Suppose the \nActing Director wrote this:  “I intend to shut down the Bureau.  \nOnce the Bureau is shut down, it will have no employees and \nwill perform no tasks.  Employees should begin preparing to \nwind up the Bureau’s operations.”  Suppose further that the \nActing  Director,  immediately  after  issuing  the  memo, \ninstructed employees to perform at least some of the Bureau’s \nrequired work indefinitely.  This memo would be a nonbinding \nstatement of something the agency intends to do in the future.  \nSee Fund for Animals, 460 F.3d at 22.  A court could not review \nit, but only specific actions taken to implement it.  See id. \nThe dissent posits that the Acting Director decided to shut \ndown the Bureau, and we do not contest this.  But the dissent \ndoes not  explain how that decision bound the agency.  It \nacknowledges that the agency’s Chief Legal Officer, just three \nweeks  after  the  posited  shutdown  decision,  instructed \nemployees to perform all legally required work.  Post at 30–31.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 42 of 109\n42 \nMoreover, the Acting Director took action inconsistent with a \nfinal  shutdown  decision  just  one  day  after  the  decision  is \nalleged to have occurred.  See J.A. 286 (February 11 email to \nan employee:  “I am specifically directing you … to continue \nindefinitely to perform all tasks necessary to publish the APOR \non weekly basis.”).  So even if an inferred shutdown decision \ncould be equivalent to a rule, the decision here was not final—\nin other words, conclusive and binding. \nThe dissent’s analysis also reflects a mismatch between \nthe final agency action inferred and the remedy provided.  If  \nthe Acting Director had promulgated a formal memorandum \ninstructing Bureau employees not to perform any work, the \nmemo would be final agency action, and the reviewing court \ncould set it aside and thereby nullify its legal consequences.  \nBut the court could not, in reviewing such a memo, enjoin or \nset  aside  other  agency  actions—such  as  a  RIF  announced \naround the same time.  Yet the dissent advocates just that \napproach.  Like the plaintiffs, the dissent contends that we \nshould set aside not only the putative shutdown decision, which \nhas no legal consequence except as implemented through other \ndecisions,  but  that  we  should  enjoin  the  constellation  of \ndiscrete actions from which it infers the shutdown decision.  \nSee post at 56–59.  As we have shown, the APA does not allow \nus to leverage our review from one discrete action to another. \n*   *   *   * \nThe  plaintiffs  seek  to  set  aside  an  abstract  decision, \ninferred  from  a  constellation  of  discrete  actions,  to \nprophylactically ensure that the Bureau can fulfill its statutory \nmandate.  This theory contravenes all the APA limits discussed \nabove—agency  action,  finality,  ripeness,  and  discreteness \nalike.  If the plaintiffs’ theory were viable, it would become the \ntask of the judiciary, rather than the Executive Branch, to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 43 of 109\n43 \ndetermine what resources an agency needs to perform its broad \nstatutory functions.  Such pervasive judicial control of agency \nadministration falls well beyond limited APA review. \nVI \nWith  no  express  cause  of  action  under  the  APA,  the \nplaintiffs must resort to equity.   \nA \nTo  seek  judicial  review,  a  party  ordinarily  needs  a \nstatutory cause of action expressly provided by Congress.  But \nsometimes, the Supreme Court has held, parties aggrieved by \nfederal agency action may seek equitable relief even without \nan express statutory cause of action.  See, e.g., Free Enter. \nFund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 \n(2010); Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 190 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  \nThe availability of such implied equitable relief substantially \ndepends  on  whether  the  plaintiff  claims  a  statutory  or \nconstitutional violation. \nImplied equitable claims that a federal agency has violated \na federal statute, which we refer to as ultra vires claims, are \n“extremely limited” in scope.  Griffith v. FLRA, 842 F.2d 487, \n493 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Confirming this point, the Supreme \nCourt recently described ultra vires challenges as “essentially \na Hail Mary pass—and in court as in football, the attempt rarely \nsucceeds.”    NRC  v.  Texas,  145  S.  Ct.  1762,  1776  (2025) \n(quoting Nyunt, 589 F.3d at 449).  To succeed on an ultra vires \nclaim, the plaintiff must show that (1) judicial review is not \nexpressly foreclosed; (2) the agency made an extreme legal \nerror; and (3) there is no alternative means for the plaintiff to \nseek judicial review.  See, e.g., Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. \nRaimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 721–22 (D.C. Cir. 2022); DCH Reg’l \nMed. Ctr. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 503, 509 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  The \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 44 of 109\n44 \nplaintiffs expressly disavow any such ultra vires claim.  For \ngood reason:  As explained above, aggrieved CFPB employees \nmay  seek  judicial  review  through  the  CSRA  scheme,  and \naggrieved  consumers  of  CFPB  services  may  seek  review \nthrough the APA cause of action for unreasonable delay. \nCourts also have long recognized implied equitable claims \narising under the Constitution.  See Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 190.  \nAnd although the Supreme Court has all but eliminated implied \ndamages actions for constitutional claims, see, e.g., Egbert v. \nBoule, 596 U.S. 482 (2022), it has continued to recognize \nimplied equitable actions “directly under the Constitution,” \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491 n.2.  For implied equitable \nclaims under the Constitution, we have imposed neither the \nrequirements for ultra vires review nor those for APA review.9 \nB \nTo avoid the requirements for an ultra vires claim, the \nplaintiffs  seek  to  describe  their  equitable  claim  here  as  a \nconstitutional one.  The claim targets the defendants’ putative \ndecision to shut down the CFPB.  As explained above, the \nplaintiffs contend that a shutdown would violate statutes that \nestablish the Bureau and require it to perform various tasks.  \n \n9  We have described such implied claims as involving “a direct \ncause of action under” the Constitution.  Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 190; \nsee also Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491 n.2 (“an implied private \nright of action directly under the Constitution”).  This terminology is \nperhaps imperfect insofar as equity courts did not speak of “causes \nof action” as such.  See Bray & Miller, Getting into Equity, 97 Notre \nDame L. Rev. 1763, 1772–76 (2022).  Regardless of historical labels, \nthe “cause of action” or “private right of action” terminology does \nhelp distinguish between two critically different questions—whether \nthe defendant has violated some provision of substantive law and \nwhether an injured plaintiff may seek redress in court. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 45 of 109\n45 \nAnd because the Executive Branch cannot “amend statutes \nunilaterally” or “usurp legislative authority conferred upon \nCongress,” the plaintiffs say that a shutdown would also violate \nthe separation of powers.  J.A. 44.  Invoking Free Enterprise \nFund, the plaintiffs thus assert what they describe as a “cause \nof  action  under  the  Constitution  for  the  violation  of  the \nseparation of powers.”  Red Br. 25. \nIn Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994), the Supreme \nCourt rejected a similar attempt to transform statutory claims \ninto  constitutional  ones.    Dalton  involved  a  presidential \ndecision to close the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.  Id. at 464.  \nReview  through  the  APA  was  unavailable  because  the \nPresident is not an “agency” for APA purposes.  See id. at 469–\n70.    Nonetheless,  following  its  decision  in  Franklin  v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992), the Court assumed an \nimplied equitable action to review presidential decisions “for \nconstitutionality.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 471–72.  The plaintiffs \nargued  that  the  President’s  decision  to  close  the  shipyard \nviolated various provisions in the governing statute.  See id.  \nThey  further  argued  that  these  statutory  violations  had  a \n“constitutional aspect” because “whenever the President acts in \nexcess  of  his  statutory  authority,  he  also  violates  the \nconstitutional  separation-of-powers  doctrine.”    Id.  at  471.  \nAccordingly,  they  concluded,  “judicial  review  must  be \navailable  to  determine  whether  the  President  has  statutory \nauthority for whatever action he takes.”  Id. (cleaned up). \nThe Supreme Court rejected this argument.  The Court \nexplained that it had “often distinguished between claims of \nconstitutional violations and claims that an official has acted in \nexcess of his statutory authority.”  511 U.S. at 472.  And if “all \nexecutive actions in excess of statutory authority were ipso \nfacto unconstitutional,” then these precedents would have had \n“little need” for “specifying unconstitutional and ultra vires \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 46 of 109\n46 \nconduct as separate categories.”  Id.  Moreover, “if every claim \nalleging that the President exceeded his statutory authority \nwere considered a constitutional claim, the exception identified \nin Franklin would be broadened beyond recognition.”  Id. at \n474.    Yet  the  “distinction  between  claims  that  an  official \nexceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims \nthat he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other, is \ntoo well established to permit this sort of evisceration.”  Id.  For \nthese reasons, the Court held that “claims simply alleging that \nthe  President  has  exceeded  his  statutory  authority  are  not \n‘constitutional’ claims” freely reviewable in equity.  Id. at 473.   \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320 \n(2015),  reinforces  this  analysis.    That  case  presented  the \nquestion  whether  healthcare  providers  have  an  implied \nequitable action for statutory violations in state Medicaid plans.  \nId.  at  324.    The  providers  argued  that  their  claims  were \nconstitutional because any state violation of a federal statute \nwould also violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, \nwhich makes federal law supreme over state law.  See U.S. \nConst. Art. VI, cl. 2; 575 U.S. at 324.  The Supreme Court \nrefused to treat the claim as a constitutional one giving rise to \nan unrestricted equitable action.  See id. at 324–27.  Instead, it \ntreated the claim as statutory—and applied ordinary canons of \nconstruction  to  conclude  that  Congress  had  foreclosed \nequitable relief.  See id. at 327–29.  In other words, statutory \nclaims do not become constitutional ones by operation of the \nseparation-of-powers principles that prevent the States and the \nExecutive Branch from disregarding federal statutes. \nThose  principles  control  this  case.    The  assertedly \nconstitutional claim here begins with the premise that shutting \ndown  the  CFPB  would  violate  the  statutes  that  create  the \nagency and require it to perform various mandatory tasks.  \nBecause CFPB leadership decided to violate these statutes, the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 47 of 109\n47 \nargument goes, it “also violate[d] the constitutional separation-\nof-powers doctrine.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 471.  This supposed \nseparation-of-powers violation turns entirely on whether CFPB \nofficials violated the governing statutes, so Dalton requires us \nto analyze the claim as an ultra vires one.  See id. at 472–74.10 \nC \nThe plaintiffs offer three responses to this straightforward \nconclusion, but none is persuasive. \nFirst, they contend that Dalton rested on a conclusion that \nthe statute at issue there committed base-closure decisions to \nthe  discretion  of  the  President,  whereas  no  statute  here \nauthorizes executive officials to shut down the CFPB.  That \nargument  confuses  two  distinct  rulings  in  Dalton.    After \nholding that constitutional review was unavailable because the \nclaims  at  issue  were  not  constitutional,  the  Court  then \nseparately considered whether ultra vires review was available.  \nAs  it  did  for  the  alleged  constitutional  claims,  the  Court \n“assume[d] for the sake of argument that some claims that the \nPresident  has  violated  a  statutory  mandate  are  judicially \nreviewable outside the framework of the APA.”  511 U.S. at \n474.  But, the Court explained, such ultra vires review “is not \navailable when the statute in question commits the decision to \nthe discretion of the President.”  Id.  Then, the Court concluded \nthat  the  statute  at  issue  did  not  “limit  the  President’s \ndiscretion,” which foreclosed ultra vires review.  See id. at 476.  \nNone of this reasoning narrowed the Court’s prior conclusion \nthat  implied  equitable  review  for  constitutional  claims  is \n \n10  In Global Health Council v. Trump, --- F.4th ---, No. 25-5097 \n(D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 2025), this Court applied Dalton to hold that an \nasserted  separation-of-powers  claim  is  statutory  rather  than \nconstitutional for reviewability purposes.  See id. at __ (slip op. at \n16–24).  Our analysis is fully consistent with Global Health Council.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 48 of 109\n48 \nunavailable where the plaintiff argues that statutory violations \nby executive officials implicate the separation of powers.  See \nid. at 472–74. \nSecond,  the  plaintiffs  invoke  the  Supreme  Court’s \nstatement in Free Enterprise Fund that the Constitution creates \nan “implied private right of action” for “separation-of-powers \nclaim[s]” as well as for individual-rights claims.  See 561 U.S. \nat 491 n.2.  But the separation-of-powers claim vindicated in \nFree Enterprise Fund was that Article II of the Constitution \nprohibits Congress  from  insulating executive officers from \npresidential control through two levels of for-cause removal \nprotection.  See id. at 514.  And since Free Enterprise Fund, \ncases engaging in implied equitable review for separation-of-\npowers  claims  have  likewise  involved  claims  that  statutes \nthemselves violate Article II or other structural constitutional \nprovisions.  See, e.g., Axon, 598 U.S. at 180; Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220, 227–28 (2021).  None of these cases casts doubt \non Dalton’s holding that claims alleging nothing more than \nexecutive actions in contravention of statutes give rise to ultra \nvires claims but not implied constitutional claims. \nFinally, the plaintiffs invoke Youngstown Sheet & Tube \nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), which held that neither the \nVesting Clause nor the Commander-in-Chief Clause of Article \nII authorized the President to seize the nation’s steel mills.  See \nid. at 585–89; U.S. Const. Art. II, § 1, cl. 1 & § 2, cl. 1.  The \ndispute in Youngstown was entirely constitutional.  As the \nSupreme  Court  explained  in  Dalton,  the  government  had \n“disclaimed any statutory authority for the President’s seizure \nof steel mills” in Youngstown, so the case “necessarily turned \non whether the Constitution authorized the President’s actions” \nthrough a freestanding Article II power.  511 U.S. at 473 (citing \nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 585–87).  This case is the opposite:  \nThe Executive has invoked no such freestanding Article II \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 49 of 109\n49 \npower.  Instead, the only constitutional source of executive \nauthority in this case is the President’s obligation to take care \nthat the statutes governing the CFPB are faithfully executed.  \nSee U.S. Const. Art. II, § 3.  And as Dalton made clear, a claim \nthat  executive  officials  have  not  discharged  such  a \nresponsibility under the Take Care Clause gives rise at most to \nan ultra vires claim.  See 511 U.S. at 472–74.11 \nVII \nSome of the plaintiffs cannot establish jurisdiction, and the \nothers have no viable cause of action.  The plaintiffs’ claims \ntherefore fail as a matter of law.  We vacate the preliminary \ninjunction  and  remand  the  case  for  further  proceedings \nconsistent with this opinion. \nSo ordered. \n \n11    The  dissent  worries  that  a  test  characterizing  claims \naccording  to  the  authority  invoked  by  the  government  would \nempower it to avoid judicial review.  Post at 54–55.  But the question \nis not whether the government may avoid judicial review; it is rather \nwhether plaintiffs must comply with statutory limits on APA review \nor judge-made limits on ultra vires review.  As we have shown, \nDalton holds that plaintiffs may not plead around those limits simply \nby contending that the Executive Branch violates the Constitution by \nacting in violation of a statute.  See 511 U.S. at 472–74.  As for the \ndissent’s further hypothetical about a President nationalizing steel \nmills yet denying it in litigation, post at 54, we repeat a point made \nearlier:    It  is  difficult  to  imagine  a  form  of  executive  action \nsufficiently public and conclusive to inflict immediate injuries but \nnot sufficiently public and conclusive to support judicial review, \nthrough the APA or otherwise. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 50 of 109\n \nPILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  Congress created the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau to safeguard consumers \nand the broader financial system after the unprecedented chaos \nand hardship of the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great \nRecession.    Congress  gave  the  Bureau  rulemaking, \nenforcement, and direct-service duties and authorities befitting \nits mission.  The Bureau’s statutory mandates, like those of \nother agencies, allow presidential administrations to exercise \nsignificant discretion in adjusting agency priorities to account \nfor changing conditions and the vision and mandate of the \nserving President.  The exercise of that prerogative is subject \nto the ordinary judicial review that prevents final agency action \nthat  is  arbitrary,  capricious,  or  in  violation  of  a  statutory \ncommand  or  constitutional  right.    The  President’s  chosen \nCFPB  leadership  may—within  those  constraints—run  the \nBureau as it determines best serves the public interest.  But it \nis emphatically not within the discretion of the President or his \nappointees to decide that the country would benefit most if \nthere were no Bureau at all.  Congress made the contrary \ndecision in legislation establishing the CFPB, and the power to \nrepeal that law lies with the legislative branch. \nThe  district  court  found  that  Defendants  acted  to \nunilaterally  abolish  the  CFPB,  apparently  viewing  its \ncontinued existence to be inconsistent with President Trump’s \nvision  for  the  federal  government.    The  court  therefore \nappropriately entered a preliminary injunction to preserve the \nstatus quo ante and prevent the destruction of the Bureau \nbefore the lawfulness of that action could be adjudicated.   \nNeither the government nor the majority seriously disputes \nthat,  if  we  accept  the  district  court’s  findings  of  fact, \nDefendants’ actions violated both the CFPB’s organic statute \nand the constitutional separation of powers.  The majority \nappropriately  rejects  the  government’s  arguments  that \nPlaintiffs lack standing to challenge the destruction of the \nCFPB, and that we otherwise lack jurisdiction to hear their \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 51 of 109\n2 \nclaims.  And the majority does not—and could not on the \nrecord before us—conclude that the district court’s factual \nfindings setting out Defendants’ actions at the time this suit was \nfiled were clearly erroneous.  The district court’s power to act \nwhen it did to preliminarily enjoin Defendants’ unlawful action \nshould be apparent and uncontroversial. \nMy  colleagues  nonetheless  vacate  the  preliminary \ninjunction  because  they  deem  the  decision  to  unilaterally \nabolish the CFPB not a type of agency action we are authorized \nto review.  That constricted view of our statutory and equitable \npower contravenes statutes, precedent, and basic principles of \nour constitutional government.  Congress created the CFPB, \nassigned it important missions and powers, and subjected its \ndecisions to the strong presumption of judicial review that \napplies as a matter of course to the final actions of federal \nagencies.  It is untenable to hold that same Congress meant the \nagency’s continued existence to be a matter of unilateral and \nunexplained presidential edict. \nThe  notion  that  courts  are  powerless  to  prevent  the \nPresident  from  abolishing  the  agencies  of  the  federal \ngovernment that he was elected to lead cannot be reconciled \nwith  either  the  constitutional  separation  of  powers  or  our \nnation’s commitment to a government of laws.  I respectfully \ndissent from the decision vacating the district court’s amply \nsupported preliminary injunction. \nI. \nA. \nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, Congress enacted the \nConsumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA, or Act) as \npart  of  the  broader  Dodd–Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and \nConsumer  Protection  Act  to  overhaul  supervision  of  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 52 of 109\n3 \nfinancial industry.  Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1955 (2010) \n(codified at 12 U.S.C. § 5481 et seq.).  After holding more than \n50  hearings  to  inform  its  development  of  an  effective \nlegislative response, Congress decided to consolidate authority \nto enforce 18 preexisting, separate consumer protection statutes \nin a single agency.  CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n, 601 U.S. \n416, 421-22 (2024); see Members of Congress Amicus Br. 20-\n22.    The  Act  therefore  created  the  Consumer  Financial \nProtection Bureau (CFPB or the Bureau), “which shall regulate \nthe offering and provision of consumer financial products or \nservices  under  the  Federal  consumer  financial  laws.”    12 \nU.S.C. § 5491(a).   \nCongress determined that the new agency, with existing \nregulatory tools under common leadership, was essential to \nsafeguard consumers’ financial interests and the stability of the \nfinancial system.  Congress gave the CFPB responsibility to \ncombat  misleading  and  fraudulent  consumer  financial \nproducts.  It sought to ensure that the true costs to consumers \nof  what  are  often  their  most  expensive  and  consequential \ninvestments  are  clearly  and  accurately  communicated  in \nadvance.  And Congress understood that sound regulation, \nreliably enforced, is also essential to a level playing field \namong competitors.  Without it, transparent and fair financial \nservices  cannot  survive  a  race  to  the  bottom  led  by \nunscrupulous  competitors  with  inferior  products.    See \nMembers of Congress Amicus Br. 20-24. \nIt has thus been the CFPB’s duty since 2010 to encourage \ncompliance with and enforce violations of existing statutes, \nincluding the Truth in Lending Act, 12 U.S.C. § 4308(a)(1), the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691c(a)(9), the \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, 12 U.S.C. § 2808(a), and \nothers.  The financial services Congress tasked the CFPB to \nregulate include credit and debit cards, Compl. ¶ 25 (J.A. 28), \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 53 of 109\n4 \nstudent loans, Barnard Decl. ¶ 5 (J.A. 184), automobile loans, \nShearer Decl. ¶ 20 (J.A. 164), home mortgages, see 12 U.S.C. \n§ 5581(b)(7), home equity loans, see 12 C.F.R. § 1026.40, \npayday lenders, see 12 U.S.C. § 5514(a)(1)(E), debt collectors, \nMeyer Decl. ¶ 6 (J.A. 62), payment apps like PayPal and \nVenmo,  see  Defining  Larger  Participants  of  a  Market  for \nGeneral-Use Digital Consumer Payment Applications, 89 Fed. \nReg. 99582 (Dec. 10, 2024), and consumer credit reporting \nservices, Meyer Decl. ¶ 5 (J.A. 62).   \nCongress also gave the Bureau some new enforcement \ntools.    See  Former  CFPB  Officials  Amicus  Br.  6-7.    For \nexample,  the  Bureau  elicits  reports  from  and  conducts \nexaminations  of  non-depository  institutions,  entities  like \nmortgage companies or payday lenders that are not banks but \nstill offer consumer financial products.  12 § U.S.C. 5514(b).  \nThe Bureau has exclusive authority to supervise very large \nbanks  with  more  than  $10  billion  in  assets—whose \nmalfeasance poses unique risks to the broader economy—for \ncompliance  with  federal  consumer-protection  laws.    Id.  § \n5515(a)-(b).  That supervisory power, which preempts similar \nefforts by state regulators, enables the Bureau to identify in \nadvance  and  communicate  to  regulated  entities  new \n“consumer-protection issues before they become systemic or \ncause  significant  harm”  and  informs  future  enforcement \nactions against violators.  States Amicus Br. 6-7, 24; see also \nFormer CFPB Officials Amicus Br. 7; Members of Congress \nAmicus Br. 24-25. \nThe  Bureau’s  enforcement  activities,  including  its \ncoordination of other regulatory bodies, are the “linchpin” of \nCongress’s chosen financial oversight regime.  Nonprofit Orgs \nAmicus Br. 15; see Halperin Decl. ¶ 5 (J.A. 198).  They reach \nboth “banks and ‘non-banks’ such as payday lenders, auto title \nlenders,  debt  collectors,  digital  payment  platforms,  and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 54 of 109\n5 \nconsumer reporting agencies,” ensuring that even companies \nnot subject to the CFPB’s direct supervisory authority comply \nwith federal consumer protection laws.  Halperin Decl. ¶ 4 (J.A. \n198).    The  CFPB’s  responsibility  for  supervising  and \nconducting  examinations  of  financial  institutions  entails \nassessing their financial health, risk management policies and \npractices,  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws.    CFPB \nsupervision heads off financial problems like the 2008 financial \ncrisis  before  they  occur  by  enabling  the  Bureau  to  “flag \nproblematic  industry  trends”  and  share  its  findings  with \nregulated  parties  “to  guide  compliance  and  promote \nconsistency and predictability.”  Nonprofit Orgs. Amicus Br. \n11-12.  The CFPB also has regulatory authority to set common \nground rules for the industry.  Its guidance on loan origination \nand servicing, for example, now shapes daily practice in the \nmortgage  industry,  after  “th[at]  sector . . . nearly  sank  the \nworld economy during the Great Recession.”  Nonprofit Orgs \nAmicus Br. 12-13.   \nThe CFPB’s work since 2010 has curbed fraudulent and \nmisleading  practices,  including  illegal  junk  fees,  deceptive \ncredit card charges, and the unlawful seizure of consumers’ \npersonal vehicles.  Salas Decl. ¶ 3 (J.A. 192); Shearer Decl. \n¶¶ 18, 20 (J.A. 163-64).  More generally, the Bureau’s work \nhas served to deter regulated entities—particularly the largest \nfinancial  institutions  who  are  largely  exempt  from  state \nfinancial  regulations—from  engaging  in  unlawful, \ndestabilizing,  and  consumer-harming  behavior.    See  States \nAmicus  Br.  24-25.    “Before  the  creation  of  the  CFPB, \nconsumer financial protection had not been the primary focus \nof any federal agency.”  Halperin Decl. ¶ 3 (J.A. 197).  The \n2008 financial crisis provided a stark reminder of the risks of \nsuch a regime.  Without the work of “the one agency whose job \nis  to  protect  all  American  consumers,”  Americans  will \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 55 of 109\n6 \ninevitably face a “higher risk of losing their homes, their cars, \nand their savings.”  Salas Decl. ¶ 11 (J.A. 196). \nCongress made extensive provision for the CFPB to carry \nout its mission.  The Act required the  creation of several \nidentified divisions and the performance of discrete functions, \nincluding  enforcement,  supervision,  and  adjudicatory \nfunctions.  See 12 U.S.C. §§ 5515, 5562-63.  The Bureau is also \nrequired to research congressionally identified topics, id. § \n5493(b)(1), maintain and staff a telephone number and website \nto  receive  and  respond  to  consumer  complaints,  id.  § \n5493(b)(3), maintain and staff offices dedicated to financial \neducation and the protection of service members, traditionally \nunderserved consumers, older Americans, and student loan \nborrowers, id. §§ 5493(d)(1), (e)(1), (b)(2), (g)(1); id. § 5535, \nand carry out other statutorily specified functions conducive to \nits core mission.  See Former CFPB Officials Amicus Br. 7-9. \nThe CFPB has continued to carry out its obligations across \nmultiple  presidential  administrations  despite  the  regulated \nsector’s significant political and legal challenges to the Bureau \nsince its creation.  In Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 \n(2020), the Supreme Court determined that the Act’s removal \nprotections for the CFPB Director violated the constitutional \nseparation of powers.  Id. at 213, 220.  When the Court severed \nthose protections from the rest of the statute, however, it held \nthat the Act’s provisions “bearing on the CFPB’s structure and \nduties remain fully operative.”  Id. at 235 (plurality opinion); \nsee  also  id.  at  296-97  (Kagan,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and \ndissenting  in  part).    The  CFPB’s  unusual  funding  system, \nwhich empowers the Bureau’s director to request funds directly \nfrom  the  Federal  Reserve  System  rather  than  proceeding \nthrough  the  normal  appropriations  process,  12  U.S.C. \n§ 5497(a), also drew legal challenge, but the Supreme Court \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 56 of 109\n7 \nupheld Congress’s chosen method to fund the Bureau.  Cmty. \nFin. Servs. Ass’n, 601 U.S. at 424. \nUntil the events of this case, however, there has never been \nany suggestion that Congress’s directives in establishing the \nCFPB were somehow optional or lacking full operative effect.  \nDuring the first Trump administration, for example, Acting \nCFPB Director Mick Mulvaney critiqued the Bureau’s funding \nmechanism as “den[ying] the American people their rightful \ncontrol over how the Bureau spends their money.”  Letter from \nMick  Mulvaney,  Acting  Dir.,  CFPB,  to  the  Hon.  Jerome \nPowell, Chair, Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. Sys. (Mar. \n23, 2018), https://perma.cc/D62E-JE6M.  But, even before the \nCourt  sustained  that  funding  mechanism,  Acting  Director \nMulvaney recognized his obligation “to execute the law as \nwritten,” and accordingly requested agency funding from the \nFederal Reserve.  Id.  What happened here represents a sea \nchange. \nB. \n  Virtually  all  the  facts  relevant  to  this  appeal  are \nundisputed.  The district court’s opinion clearly sets forth the \ncourt’s findings of fact and amply supports them by reference \nto the record.  See NTEU v. Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d 1, 16-39 \n(D.D.C. 2025).  Those findings more than adequately justify \nthe district court’s entry of a preliminary injunction to preserve \nthe possibility of relief if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail.  I briefly \nrecount here the key facts. \n  Starting on February 6, officials at the Department of \nTreasury directed the Bureau to allow officials from the United \nStates Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access \nto CFPB headquarters.  Id. at 40.  The next day, February 7, \nPresident Trump designated Office of Management and Budget \nDirector  Russell  Vought  as  acting  director  of  the  Bureau.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 57 of 109\n8 \nUnder the new leadership, the CFPB’s homepage was taken \noffline, Third Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 19-21 (J.A. 172-73), and Elon \nMusk—whom  President  Trump  described  as  “head[ing] \nDOGE”1—posted “CFPB RIP” alongside a tombstone emoji \non his personal X account, Am. Compl. ¶ 39 (J.A. 33). \nThe next day, OMB Director Vought instructed CFPB \nstaff not to approve any rules or guidance, take enforcement \nactions, issue public communications, or take certain other \nactions “unless . . . required by law.”  Feb. 8 Vought Email \n(J.A.  117).    That  email  echoed  language  from  an  earlier \nmessage  to  Bureau  staff  from  then-Acting  Director  (and \nTreasury Secretary) Scott Bessent.  See Feb. 3 Bessent Email \n(J.A. 110).  Vought followed that missive with a directive to all \nBureau Employees on the morning of Monday, February 10, \ncategorically ordering them to “not perform any work tasks” \nwithout  securing  written  approval  from  him  through  the \nBureau’s new Chief Legal Officer, Mark Paoletta.  Feb. 10 \nVought Email (Stop Work Order) (J.A. 101).  Unlike previous \ncommunications, the Stop Work Order referenced no exception \nfor performing statutorily required work.  It was soon followed \nby the announcement of a public tip line encouraging members \nof  the  public  to  report  CFPB  employees  who  might  be \nattempting to do their jobs “in violation” of the Stop Work \nOrder.  Frotman Decl. ¶¶ 5-6 (J.A. 204-05).   \nOn  the  heels  of  the  Bureau-wide  Stop  Work  Order, \nPresident Trump triumphantly told a reporter that “we did the \nright thing” because the Bureau “was a very important thing to \nget rid of,” and he “praised his administration for shutting \n[down] the CFPB.”  Compl. ¶ 47 (J.A. 36).

They \ndirected staff to terminate hard-fought litigation midstream:   \nThe cases dismissed by the CFPB sought relief on \nbehalf  of  students  who  were  subject  to  illegal \ncollections  on  loans  that  had  been  discharged  in \nbankruptcy; borrowers who were deceived about the \ntrue cost of loans made on a peer-to-peer nonbank \nlending platform; people shopping for a mortgage \nloan that were victims of an illegal scheme to steer \nthem to a specific lender; manufactured home buyers \nwho were set up to fail with unaffordable loans; \nstruggling customers of small dollar loans who were \ninduced  into  a  fee-harvesting  and  loan-churning \nscheme; and consumers who were deceived about \ntheir  personal  savings  accounts.  The  CFPB’s \ncomplaints had alleged that consumers in these cases \nexperienced billions of dollars of harm. \nHalperin Decl. ¶ 16 (J.A. 201).  Bureau leadership halted \nimpending  examinations  at  mortgage  lenders,  auto  finance \ncompanies,  debt  collection  agencies,  and  other  consumer-\nfacing  industries  that  the  Bureau  was  undertaking  in \ncooperation with state regulators.  Salas Decl. ¶ 9 (J.A. 195).  \nOnly a trickle of public-facing activities resumed after Paoletta \ninstructed staff to at least partially restart them—a step he took \nin response to advice that keeping them offline risked a public \nbacklash.  See Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 89:2-6, 192:21-25 (J.A. \n988, 1091). \nWith the Bureau’s work effectively shuttered, Defendants \nthen took steps to permanently unwind the agency.  During the \nweek  that  started  with  the  Stop  Work  Order  on  Monday, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 59 of 109\n10 \nDefendants  fired  all  the  Bureau’s  probationary  and  term \nemployees.  Drew Doe Decl. ¶ 5 (J.A. 135).  That Tuesday, the \nBureau’s  Chief  Financial  Officer  directed  staff  to  inform \nleadership of any “contracts directly support[ing] a statutory \nrequirement, meaning that [the Bureau] would not be able to \nmeet a statutory requirement without this contract.”  Ex. F (J.A. \n416-17).  But that exercise was pointless.  Rather than conduct \nany discernably rational assessment of which contracts were \nnecessary for the Bureau to continue to do the work Congress \nassigned it, Paoletta simply terminated all contracts across five \nseparate  divisions  of  the  Bureau—a  mere  six  hours  after \nsupposedly expressing an interest in knowing which contracts \nhad to be preserved.  Feb. 11 Paoletta Email (J.A. 288).  The \nterminated contracts included, for example, every contract in \nthe Office of Consumer Response, even though that Office had \nresponded to leadership’s earlier request and singled out some \nof those contracts as necessary for statutorily required work.  \nEx. F (J.A. 417); Pfaff Decl. ¶ 27 (J.A. 148).  Bureau leadership \ndirected contracting officers to terminate the chosen contracts \nless than an hour after Paoletta’s order.  Feb. 11 Galicki Email \n(J.A. 407).  Presumably because of Defendants’ urgency to \neliminate those necessary contracts as soon as possible, the \ntermination  letters  included  no  directions  to  contractors  to \npreserve Bureau data or records they held on behalf of the \nBureau.  Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 174:6-10 (J.A. 1073).  As a result, \ncritical systems were turned off before the CFPB’s employees \nor contractors could secure the agency’s data, raising the risk \nthat some of the data loss may have been irrecoverable.  Drew \nDoe Decl. ¶ 6 (J.A. 135). \n  Having  eliminated  the  Bureau’s  contracts  and \nprobationary and term employees, Defendants moved on by \nWednesday  to  shed  the  CFPB’s  permanent  staff.    On  the \nevening of February 12, the Bureau agreed to pay OPM for \n“restructuring  assistance  services”  related  to  a  planned \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 60 of 109\n11 \nReduction in Force (RIF).  Ex. II (J.A. 572-73).  Federal \nregulations ordinarily require agencies to give employees who \nwill be subjected to a RIF 90 days’ advance notice to enable \nthose employees to compete for other positions.  See 5 C.F.R. \n§ 351.402(c).  However, on Thursday CFPB Chief Operating \nOfficer Adam Martinez asked OPM for an exception to the 90-\nday rule, explaining that the RIF was being done in immediate \nresponse to the Stop Work Order.  Feb. 13 RIF Request (J.A. \n578-80).  OPM approved the request, and Defendants began \npreparing the paperwork to fire about 1200 employees with the \nbare minimum 30-day notice, leaving the Bureau with less than \na fifth of its original headcount, and to place the employees on \nadministrative leave in the interim.  Feb. 13 RIF Request (J.A. \n578-80); Feb. 14 Martinez Administrative Leave Email (J.A. \n582); see Mar. 11 Hearing Tr. 45:9-18 (J.A. 1219).  Martinez \nexplained to staff that the regulation’s 90-day period, designed \nto give employees subject to RIFs the opportunity to compete \nfor remaining positions, was unnecessary because the Bureau’s \nelimination would leave no remaining positions.  Mar. 11 \nHearing Tr. 59:14-22 (J.A. 1233).  Defendants planned for the \nRIF of the vast majority of the Bureau’s staff to take place by \nthe end of the day on Friday February 14, one week after \nVought  was  named  Acting  Director.    Feb.  14  Martinez \nAdministrative Leave Email (J.A. 582).  Those plans were \ndisrupted by this litigation. \nC. \n  Plaintiffs,  a  group  of  nonprofits  that  benefit  from  the \nCFPB’s work together with organizations that represent the \nBureau’s employees, filed suit on February 9.  On February 13, \nPlaintiffs  filed  an  amended  complaint  and  moved  for  a \ntemporary restraining order.  On February 14, the district court \nscheduled a hearing on the TRO motion for that afternoon.  \nMartinez and the others working on the ongoing RIF planning \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 61 of 109\n12 \nwere soon informed of the scheduled hearing.  Ex. LL (J.A. \n584).   \nImpending court proceedings gave Defendants no pause; \nthey responded by doubling down.  Less than 10 minutes after \nMartinez  received  an  email  alerting  him  to  the  scheduled \nfederal  court  hearing—and  a  mere  16  minutes  before  the \nhearing was scheduled to begin—the Bureau told OPM that it \ncould no longer “wait until COB” and instead “need[ed] the \nlast set of [RIF materials] now.”  Ex. MM (J.A. 586).  The \nBureau’s leadership and OPM continued to send emails back \nand forth for the next few hours, with OPM confirming that the \nRIF was necessary to implement the Stop Work Order, and \nMartinez  explaining  that  the  remaining  Bureau  employees \n(including himself) would be terminated “in the next group” by \nan ensuing RIF.  Feb. 14 Martinez RIF Email (J.A. 539).  \n  Defendants were unable to finalize the RIF before the \ndistrict court acted.  On the afternoon of Friday, February 14, \nthe court entered a partial stay by consent order.  The stay order \nprohibited Defendants from deleting CFPB data, terminating \nadditional CFPB employees (except for cause), or transferring \naway the Bureau’s funds.  Consent Order (J.A. 99-100).  The \ninitial stay order was supplemented by an agreement between \nthe  parties  to  freeze  any  additional  contract  terminations \npending the district court’s ruling on a preliminary injunction.  \nSee Joint Notice of Agreement, ECF No. 65.2 \nThe RIF team at the CFPB continued to meet during the \nfollowing week, with Martinez informing colleagues that the \nRIF would resume and the agency would completely shut down \nafter the court order was lifted.

Drew Doe Decl. ¶¶ 7-8 \n(J.A. 136).  Meanwhile, the Stop Work Order remained in \neffect and the  Bureau’s congressionally assigned functions \nhalted.  The agency drifted along in that state of limbo until \nearly March. \n  The  district  court  scheduled  oral  argument  on  the \npreliminary injunction motion for March 3.  On the afternoon \nbefore the scheduled argument, Paoletta sent a message to all \nBureau staff stating “[i]t has come to my attention . . . that \nsome employees have not been performing statutorily required \nwork” since the Stop Work Order.  Mar. 2 Paoletta Email (J.A. \n338).  Paoletta informed staff that “work that is required by \nlaw”  could  proceed  without  prior  approval  from  Bureau \nleadership—although he gave no instruction on which work \nwas and was not “required by law.”  Over the next few days, \nPaoletta  authorized  some  requests  from  staff  to  resume \nfunctions that had been halted by the Stop Work Order.  See \nMar.  2  Paoletta/Warren  Emails  (J.A.  341-44);  Mar.  2 \nPaoletta/Johnson Emails (J.A. 347); Mar. 3 Correal Email (J.A. \n351);  Mar.  3  Martinez/Lee  Emails  (J.A.  374-77);  Mar.  3 \nPaoletta/Pappalardo Emails (J.A. 390-91).   \nThe White House appears not to have understood the \nnewfound importance of demonstrating a commitment to the \nBureau’s  statutory  work.    The  White  House  website  soon \ncelebrated  that  the  CFPB  had  been  “ordered . . . to  halt \noperations.”  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 47.  And, given the \nlack of direction, staff remained confused as to what work, if \nany, they were authorized to perform.  See Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. \n105:12-16, 109:13-21 (J.A. 1004, 1008). \n  On  March  10-11,  the  district  court  held  a  two-day \nevidentiary hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 63 of 109\n14 \nat which Martinez testified as Defendants’ primary witness.  \nBefore the hearing, Martinez submitted a declaration stating \nthat, notwithstanding the Stop Work Order, the Bureau was \ncontinuing  to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligations,  and  that  the \nCFPB’s leadership was “engaging in ongoing decision-making \nto  assess  how  to  make  the  Bureau  more  efficient  and \naccountable.”  First Martinez Decl. ¶¶ 19-23 (J.A. 106-07).  But \nonce Plaintiffs submitted evidence showing that Defendants’ \nactions had in fact prevented the Bureau from performing its \nrequired activities, and that Martinez himself had told staff that \nthe CFPB was shutting down, Martinez revised his position.   \nIn a supplemental declaration, Martinez conceded that \nclaims from Bureau employees that Martinez had said the \nagency was closing entirely were “not inaccurate,” and in fact \naligned with DOGE directives that Martinez understood “to \nreflect the position of agency leadership.”  Supp. Martinez \nDecl. ¶ 3 (J.A. 240).  However, Martinez continued, “since \nthen . . . a great deal has evolved at the CFPB,” and the current \nleadership—admittedly, the same people as before—was now \n“focused  on  running  a  substantially  more  streamlined  and \nefficient [B]ureau,” having moved on from the “very fluid \nsituation” around February 10.  Id. ¶ 4 (J.A. 241). \n  At the hearing, Martinez testified to similar effect.  He \nconfirmed what he averred in his supplemental declaration:  \nBased on communications from DOGE staff operating with \nauthorization of agency leadership, he had understood as of the \nweek of February 10 that the CFPB was being closed down and \nthat his statements to the contrary in his first declaration were \ninaccurate.  Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 54-55, 126-28 (J.A. 953-54, \n1025-27).  He also testified that Defendants had been in the \nprocess of eliminating entire statutorily required divisions of \nthe CFPB before the district court intervened.  Mar. 10 Hearing \nTr.  130-31  (J.A.  1029-30).    But,  Martinez  added, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 64 of 109\n15 \n“circumstances [had] changed since the week of February 10,” \nand Vought did not currently intend to implement the plans that \nwere being carried out during the week of February 10.  Mar. \n10 Hearing Tr. 56, 61:6-8 (J.A. 955, 960).   \nThen, on cross-examination, Martinez backtracked again.  \nHe conceded that neither Vought, Paoletta, nor anyone else had \ntold him that the plan had changed at any time since  the \nannouncement that the Bureau was to be abolished.  Mar. 10 \nHearing  Tr.  158,  229-230  (J.A.  1057,  1128-29).    He \nacknowledged that he did not know the current plans for the \nCFPB.  Mar. 11 Hearing Tr. 24-25 (J.A. 1198-99).   \nMartinez further testified that, until the eve of the March 3 \ndistrict court argument when Vought sent out his email telling \nstaff  that  they  had  apparently  been  free  to  do  statutorily \nrequired  work  all  along,  Bureau  employees  had  not  been \nperforming required activities since the Stop Work Order.  See \nMar. 10 Hearing Tr. 66:10-16 (J.A. 965).  Martinez conceded \nthat statements in his first declaration—that the Bureau had in \nfact been performing obligatory functions despite the Stop \nWork Order—were false.  See Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 187-88 \n(J.A.  1086-87).    He  further  admitted  he  would  “not  [be] \nsurprise[d]” if staff remained sidelined even after Vought’s \nsupposedly clarifying email, and that he did not know how \nmany staff had been brought back from administrative leave \nfollowing Defendants’ newly professed commitment to the \nBureau’s resumption of statutorily required work.  Mar. 10 \nHearing Tr. 67-68 (J.A. 966-67).  Martinez also acknowledged \nthat,  without  any  apparent  forethought  or  assessment, \nDefendants had cancelled scores of contracts necessary to the \nBureau’s work.  See Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 70-71 (J.A. 969-70). \nPlaintiffs presented two witnesses at the hearing.  The first, \na pseudonymous CFPB employee listed in the record as Alex \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 65 of 109\n16 \nDoe, testified that on the week of February 10 Martinez and \nDOGE  staffers,  relaying  instructions  from  Defendants, \nexplained  that  the  Bureau  was  in  the  process  of  being \neliminated, Mar. 11 Hearing Tr. 39-40 (J.A. 1213-14), and that \nall staff would be subjected to RIFs across multiple divisions \nwith no employees to be retained, Mar. 11 Hearing Tr. 43 (J.A. \n1217).  Doe further testified that Martinez said that the plan \nremained unchanged after the week of February 10.  Mar. 11 \nHearing Tr. 59-60, 63-64 (J.A. 1233-34, 1237-38).  The second \nwitness, Matthew Pfaff, Chief of Staff at the Bureau’s Office \nof Consumer Response, testified that his office had been unable \nto respond to consumer complaints or referrals because of the \nStop Work Order and Defendants’ cancellation of contracts, \nincluding contracts that employees had told Defendants were \nnecessary  to  perform  statutorily  required  work.    Mar.  11 \nHearing Tr. 76-79 (J.A. 1250-53).   \n  Following  the  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district  court \ngranted  the  preliminary  injunction.    The  court  held  that \nPlaintiffs  had  a  cause  of  action  under  the  Constitution  to \nchallenge the alleged termination of the Bureau on separation-\nof-powers grounds, and that they could challenge both the Stop \nWork Order and the action shuttering the CFPB under the \nAPA.  The court also determined that the plaintiff nonprofit \norganizations had standing because they and their members \nwould be harmed by the shutdown of the Bureau, and that harm \ncould be redressed by a court order preventing Defendants \nfrom abolishing the agency.  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 49-53. \nOn the merits, the court rejected Defendants’ “attempts to \ndeny what was afoot” as “at odds with the undisputed facts in \nthe record and the documents produced by both sides.”  Id. at \n47.  The court found that Defendants’ attempts to demonstrate \nthat the Bureau was carrying out its required work were “highly \nmisleading, if not intentionally false,” and “ha[d] been shown \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 66 of 109\n17 \nto  be  unreliable  and  inconsistent  with  the  agency’s  own \ncontemporaneous records.”  Id. at 57.  The court emphasized \nthat Defendants’ efforts to characterize the Stop Work Order, \nin defiance of the record, as “not really a stop work order at all” \nwere  “so  disingenuous  that  the  [c]ourt  is  left  with  little \nconfidence that [Defendants] can be trusted to tell the truth \nabout anything.”  Id.   \nThe court concluded by finding that Defendants “were in \nfact engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency \ndown entirely when the motion for injunctive relief was filed; \nwhile  the  effort  to  do  so  was  stalled  by  the  [c]ourt's \nintervention, the plan remains unchanged; and [Defendants] \nhave absolutely no intention of operating the CFPB at all.”  Id. \nat 57-58. \nOn that basis, the court held that Plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed  on  the  merits  of  their  claim  that  Defendants  had \nunlawfully ordered the shuttering of the Bureau.  Id.  Plaintiffs \nhad  shown  irreparable  harm,  the  court  found,  because \nDefendants would finish eliminating the agency in short order \nin the absence of a preliminary injunction forbidding it.  The \nbalance of equities and the public interest also favored an \ninjunction.  The public interest would be served by preventing \nDefendants  from  “overstep[ping]  their  statutory  and \nconstitutional  authority  and  usurp[ing]  the  power  of  the \nmembers of Congress.”  Id. at 82.  And the public interest \nwould be served by preventing the massive disruption of the \nfinancial sector that would occur if the CFPB were shut down.  \nId. at 82-84.   \n  The  preliminary  injunction  directed  Defendants  to:  1) \nmaintain and not delete Bureau records and data, 2) reinstate \nthe probationary and term employees who had been fired, 3) \nnot  terminate  or  subject  to  a  RIF  any  additional  CFPB \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 67 of 109\n18 \nemployee, except for cause, 4) not enforce the Stop Work \nOrder, 5) provide Bureau employees with the means to work \nin-office or remotely, 6) maintain the Office of Consumer \nResponse’s consumer complaint system, and 7) rescind notices \nof contract termination and not finalize the termination of any \nfuture contract (although Defendants were permitted to halt \ncontracts  following  an  individualized  assessment  that  they \nwere unnecessary).  Preliminary Injunction Order at 1-3 (J.A. \n745-47). \n  Defendants appealed to this court and sought to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal.   In seeking a stay, \nDefendants did not meaningfully contest the propriety of an \ninjunction preventing them from unlawfully abolishing the \nCFPB;  they  argued  only  that  portions  of  the  preliminary \ninjunction  were  overbroad  in  ways  that  impermissibly \nrestricted their management discretion.  See Stay Mot. Oral \nArg.  Tr.  6-7.    We  responded  by  partially  staying  the \npreliminary injunction to afford legitimate managerial leeway.  \nThe stay order permitted Defendants to refrain from reinstating \nterminated  employees  whom  they  had  determined  were \nunnecessary  to  fulfilling  the  Bureau’s  statutory  duties,  to \nconduct further terminations or RIFs of employees who had \nbeen determined to be similarly unnecessary, and to conduct \nlimited  work  stoppages  of  activities  that  Defendants  had \ndetermined  were  not  necessary  for  the  Bureau’s  legal \nobligations.  NTEU v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 1721068 \n(D.C. Cir. Apr. 11, 2025). \nDays after our partial stay, Defendants attempted a RIF of \napproximately  90%  of  the  Bureau’s  employees.    When \nPlaintiffs asked the district court to halt that RIF as inconsistent \nwith the unstayed portions of the preliminary injunction, the \ngovernment sought clarification from us.  We reinstated the \noriginal  prohibition  of  all  RIFs  to  avoid  further  collateral \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 68 of 109\n19 \nlitigation or personnel action that might prevent Plaintiffs from \n“receiv[ing] meaningful final relief should [Defendants] not \nprevail” on their appeal.  NTEU v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 \nWL 1721136 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, 2025). \nII. \n  We  review  the  district  court’s  decision  to  grant  a \npreliminary  injunction  for  abuse  of  discretion,  its  legal \nconclusions de novo, and its factual findings for clear error.  \nMedia Matters for Am. v. Paxton, 138 F.4th 563, 573 (D.C. Cir. \n2025).    “[D]eciding  whether  to  grant  a preliminary \ninjunction is normally to make a choice under conditions of \ngrave uncertainty.”  Singh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 95 (D.C. Cir. \n2022)  (quoting  O  Centro  Espirita  Beneficiente  Uniao  do \nVegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 1015 (10th Cir. 2004) (en \nbanc)  (McConnell,  J.,  concurring)).    The  purpose  of  a \npreliminary injunction is not to finally set the obligations of the \nparties, but to “preserve the status quo pending the outcome of \nlitigation.”  Dist. 50, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Int’l \nUnion, United Mine Workers of Am., 412 F.2d. 165, 168 (D.C. \nCir. 1969). \nI concur in the majority’s holding that at least one plaintiff \nnonprofit organization is likely to demonstrate standing to \nchallenge the unlawful shutdown of the CFPB.  Because only \none plaintiff need have standing for us to reach the merits, \nMountain States Legal Found. v. Glickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1232 \n(D.C. Cir. 1996), we need not address whether the employee \nplaintiffs’ claims were also properly asserted in district court \nor  must  instead  be  channeled  through  the  separate \nadministrative  structure  Congress  created  for  federal \nemployment disputes. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 69 of 109\n20 \nIII. \n  Plaintiffs press an APA challenge to Defendants’ “final, \nconcrete decision to shut down the agency entirely.”  Vought, \n774  F.  Supp.  3d  at  47.    Defendants  strenuously  deny  the \nexistence of such a decision.  They insist they never adopted \nany policy to unlawfully abolish the Bureau.  But the district \ncourt made well-supported findings of fact to the contrary.  \nDefendants  offered  no  contemporaneous  alternative \nexplanation for their challenged conduct that squares with both \nthe facts and the Bureau’s statutory obligations going forward.  \nAnd they certainly have not carried their burden to show clear \nerror in the district court’s findings. \nDefendants argue instead that Plaintiffs lack a cause of \naction under the APA to contest a decision to abolish an agency \ncreated by Congress.  Rather than seek APA review of any \nshutdown order, Defendants assert, Plaintiffs must await and \nchallenge each of the steps the agency would have taken to \nimplement  the  Bureau’s  shuttering.    Vought  Br.  37-38.  \nAlternatively, Defendants argue, Plaintiffs should have waited \nuntil  the  Bureau  had  been  abolished  entirely  and  then \nchallenged its inevitable failure to perform statutorily required \nwork under the APA quasi-mandamus provision allowing a \nplaintiff  to  “compel  agency  action  unlawfully  withheld  or \nunreasonably delayed.”  Vought Br. 40-41 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(1)).  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the directive to shut down \nthe agency, Defendants say, exceeds limits Congress placed on \nany APA cause of action, such as the bar on “programmatic \nchallenges”  that  do  not  identify  a  discrete  agency  action \namenable to review.  Vought Br. 22, 30-31. \nDefendants’ position that Plaintiffs have no APA cause of \naction to challenge an agency’s policy decision to cease some \n(actually all) of its ongoing work is incompatible with binding \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 70 of 109\n21 \nprecedent.  Notwithstanding all of Defendants’ objections that \ntheir  challenged  action  is  non-final  or  too  diffuse,  or  that \nPlaintiffs’ claim is somehow unripe, the Supreme Court has \nundertaken APA review of agency action that, like the policy \ndecision Plaintiffs challenge in this case, directed an agency to \nshut down its activities.  Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 809 \n(2022); Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., \n591 U.S. 1, 16-18 (2020); see also Public Citizen v. Steed, 733 \nF.2d 93, 98 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  At bottom, the basis Defendants \nrely on to distinguish those cases is that the agencies there made \nformal, published announcements of their policy decisions, \nwhereas the record in this case contains no similarly public \nannouncement.  But Defendants may not evade APA review \nsolely because, as the district court found, Defendants acted to \nabolish  the  agency  without  bothering  to  draft  an  official \nmemorandum first.   \nCircuit precedent is clear that agency action need not “be \ncommitted to writing” to be judicially reviewable.  Bhd. of \nLocomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 972 F.3d \n83, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  We have held an agency takes final \naction  “by  adopting  [a]  policy”  that  binds  its  employees, \nregardless of whether or how the agency memorializes that \npolicy’s adoption.  Venetian Casino Resort, LLC v. EEOC, 530 \nF.3d 925, 931 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  Any rule to the contrary would \nsimply encourage agencies to act in secret, in defiance of \nfoundational principles of administrative law. \nPlaintiffs may challenge the decision to abolish the CFPB \nas final agency action under the APA.  Because Defendants \nhave never argued that their shutting down of the Bureau was \nlawful under any substantive standard we might apply to such \naction, the district court appropriately found that Plaintiffs \nwere  likely  to  succeed  on  that  challenge  and  entered  a \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 71 of 109\n22 \npreliminary injunction to preserve the agency while litigation \ncontinues. \nA. \nPlaintiffs’  statutory  claims  face  a  threshold  question \nwhether they have identified a “final agency action” subject to \nchallenge under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  The “central \npurpose” of the APA is to permit a “broad spectrum of judicial \nreview of agency action.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. \n879, 903 (1988).  Courts therefore read the word “action” \ngenerously to encompass “comprehensively every manner in \nwhich an agency may exercise its power.”  Whitman v. Am. \nTrucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  The “bite” in the \nstatute is instead provided by the condition that the action also \nbe “final,” id., requiring that it both “mark the consummation \nof the agency’s decisionmaking process” and “be [an action] \nby which rights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S.  154,  177-78  (1997)  (citations  omitted).    An  action’s \neffects need not be immediate for it to be subject to APA \nchallenge, so long as it “result[s] in a final determination of \nrights or obligations.”  Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. at 809 n.7 \n(citation omitted).  And, as just noted above, we may review \nagency action even if it is not “committed to writing.”  Bhd. of \nLocomotive Eng’rs, 972 F.3d at 100. \nThe district court held that the “final, concrete decision to \nshut down the agency entirely” was final agency action subject \nto challenge under the APA.  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 47.  \nDefendants’ primary argument to the contrary is that a decision \nto eliminate the Bureau would only be “a preliminary step \nalong the way to a final action.”  Vought Br. 37.  In other \nwords, Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs were required to \ndelay filing their suit until the Bureau had been destroyed, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 72 of 109\n23 \nrather than challenge the determination to eliminate the CFPB \nin the first place.  The law assuredly does not so require. \nAn example drawn from Plaintiffs’ brief helps to illustrate \nthe point.  See NTEU Br. 3.  Imagine if, on February 10, Acting \nDirector Vought had issued a formal written memorandum to \nCFPB staff announcing that the Bureau was closing up shop \nand  telling  employees  to  “take  all  appropriate  actions  to \nterminate the Bureau.”  By itself, such a memo would have no \nimmediate,  real-world  effect  on  any  person  who,  like  the \nnonprofit plaintiffs in this case, benefited from the CFPB’s \nexistence and would be harmed by its shuttering.  Only once \nsubordinate staff began to implement the order by, for example, \nhalting lawsuits promising relief, terminating contracts needed \nfor the Bureau’s work, refusing to accept or respond to hotline \nrequests, and firing the Bureau’s employees would the memo’s \nimpact on would-be plaintiffs be felt.  But the law is clear that \nsuch a memo reflects reviewable agency action.  Plaintiffs need \nnot wait until the policy decision is fully implemented before \nthey can challenge it.  See Toilet Goods Ass’n v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S. 158, 164 (1967) (explaining that agency action is ripe for \njudicial review when “the impact of the administrative action \ncould be said to be felt immediately by those subject to it”). \nIn  Biden  v.  Texas,  the  Supreme  Court  endorsed  APA \nreview of a decision that could just as easily be characterized \nas “a preliminary step along the way” to a complete action, \nVought Br. 37, as the Bureau shutdown in this case.   The \ndistrict  court  accepted  the  claim  for  review  as  soon  as \nHomeland  Security  Secretary  Mayorkas  issued  the  memo \nterminating the “Remain in Mexico” program and directing \nstaff “to take all appropriate actions to terminate [the program], \nincluding taking all steps necessary to rescind implementing \nguidance and other directives or policy guidance issued to \nimplement the program.”  Biden v. Texas, 595 U.S. at 793-94.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 73 of 109\n24 \nThat memo qualified as final agency action because it bound \nstaff to stop implementing the terminated program—just as the \nhypothesized Vought memo would have bound Bureau staff to \ndiscontinue their own work.  See id. at 808-09.  In fact, in Biden \nv. Texas the Supreme Court also held that a later, similar memo \nlikewise qualified as reviewable agency action even though \nthat memo ordered staff to take no action to terminate the \nprogram until ongoing litigation was completed.  Id. at 809 n.7.  \nNo matter that, by its own terms, the memo could have no real-\nworld effect until the occurrence of a separate event beyond the \nagency’s control.  Nothing in Biden v. Texas suggests that the \ngovernment  could  have  forestalled  a  court  challenge  by \nordering the termination of the entirety of Customs and Border \nProtection, or the whole Department of Homeland Security, \ninstead of that individual program. \nIn this case, of course, there is no record of such a memo.  \nIt is especially remarkable that Defendants rely on the absence \nof  documentation  here,  at  a  litigation  stage  prior  to  any \ndiscovery into the internal machinations of Bureau leadership, \nand on a record that reflects Defendants’ deliberate avoidance \nof the ordinary tools of openly reasoned and vetted agency \ndecision making.  The lack of evidence that Vought reduced \nhis directive to writing is of no legal import—just as the result \nin Biden v. Texas would have been the same had Secretary \nMayorkas elected to terminate the Remain in Mexico program \norally or by semaphore rather than by written command.   \nBinding circuit precedent confirms the point.  In Venetian \nCasino Resort, the plaintiff challenged the EEOC’s alleged \npolicy authorizing Commission staff to disclose an employer’s \nconfidential business information without first notifying the \nemployer.  530 F.3d at 927.  As part of its defense, the EEOC \nargued that its internal compliance manual, which appeared to \nauthorize such disclosures, was not reviewable final agency \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 74 of 109\n25 \naction because it was a guidance document and did not create \nany legal obligations.  Id. at 931.  But we held that argument \n“misdirected,” as: \nVenetian does not contend the Manual itself is a final \nagency  action.    Rather,  Venetian  challenges  the \ndecision of the Commission to adopt a policy of \ndisclosing confidential information without notice.  \nThe Manual is relevant insofar as it illuminates the \nnature of the policy, but the agency took final action \nby adopting the policy, not by including it in the \nManual.  Adopting a policy of permitting employees \nto disclose confidential information without notice is \nsurely  a  consummation  of  the  agency’s \ndecisionmaking  process,  and  one  by  which  [the \nsubmitter’s]  rights  [and  the  agency’s]  obligations \nhave been determined. \nId. (formatting altered).  So too here.   \nThe CFPB took final action when it adopted a policy to \nshut itself down, just as the Department of Homeland Security \ntook final action by adopting a policy to terminate the Remain \nin Mexico program.  The specific verbal and written statements \nof Vought and others are critical evidence as to what action the \nBureau did or did not take, but the action itself is the “manner \nin which an agency . . . exercise[s] its power,” Am. Trucking, \n531 U.S. at 478, rather than the method by which that exercise \nof power is communicated or memorialized.  Indeed, at oral \nargument the government’s counsel conceded the point that \ncourts may “infer from circumstantial evidence that there’s a \ndecision.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 78:6-7.  In the district court, Plaintiffs \nalso pursued an alternative theory that the Stop Work Order \nwas itself final agency action challengeable under the APA.  \nSee Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 42-46; NTEU Br. 32-34.  But \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 75 of 109\n26 \nthe  gravamen  of  their  claim  is  simply  that  “[D]efendants \ndecided to shut down the agency.”  NTEU Br. 14.  The scope \nand effects of the Stop Work Order certainly reinforce the \nnature of the action Defendants took, but resolving this case \ndoes not require analyzing that Order separately under the \nAPA. \nB. \n  Because  binding  precedent  establishes  that  adopting  a \npolicy to terminate the CFPB would constitute final reviewable \nagency action, the next question is whether Defendants in fact \nadopted  such  a  policy.    The  district  court  found  in  the \naffirmative.  As the court explained:  “The decision to close an \nagency is not a theoretical or hypothetical concept—it’s real. \nThe agency is either open or it’s not.”  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d \nat 47.  And the record supports the district court’s finding that \nDefendants made “a final, concrete decision to shut down the \nagency entirely.”  Id.  Following a two-day evidentiary hearing \nand review of extensive written evidence, the district court \nconcluded that “defendants were in fact engaged in a concerted, \nexpedited effort to shut the agency down entirely” on the week \nof February 10.   Id.  at 58.  Defendants had  ordered “the \nwholesale cessation of activities” through “the decision to shut \ndown the agency completely, id. at 46, and “the agency was \nbarreling  full  speed  ahead  in  [the]  effort  to  dismantle  the \nagency completely by the end of the week [of February 10],” \nid. at 58, before the district court intervened.  Those findings \nare well supported by the record and certainly survive clear \nerror review. \n  To recap the most relevant undisputed facts of record:  The \nsame day that Vought was named acting CFPB director, CFPB \nleadership took the Bureau’s website offline and deleted its X \naccount, while Elon Musk—whose DOGE subordinates were \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 76 of 109\n27 \nembedded within the Bureau—posted “CFPB RIP” alongside \na tombstone emoji on his personal X account.  Third Meyer \nDecl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 172); Kaspar Decl. ¶ 6 (J.A. 52).  On February \n10, the first full workday after Vought’s appointment, Vought \ndirected CFPB employees to “not perform any work tasks.”  \nStop Work Order (J.A. 101).  President Trump announced the \nsame day that “[t]he CFPB was a very important thing to get \nrid of” and “we did the right thing.”  Frotman Decl. ¶ 4 (J.A. \n204); Roston/Scible Decl. Ex. G, ECF No. 38-17; see Vought, \n774 F. Supp. 3d at 16-38, 40.  The next day, Bureau Chief Legal \nOfficer Paoletta ordered the cancellation of all contracts in \nseveral of the CFPB’s largest and most important divisions, \nincluding Enforcement, Supervision, and Consumer Response.  \nFeb. 11 Paoletta Email (J.A. 288).  The terminated contracts \nincluded the contracts that staff had, at Paoletta’s request, \nidentified as necessary for the Bureau’s (statutorily required) \nwork.  Pfaff Decl. ¶ 27 (J.A. 148).  CFPB employees were \ndirected  to  terminate  contracts  as  fast  as  possible  without \nbothering to take typical measures to preserve CFPB data.  \nMar. 10 Hearing Tr. 174 (J.A. 1073); Charlie Doe Decl. ¶¶ 3-\n5, 12 (J.A. 129-30, 132).  After terminating all probationary \nand term-limited employees, Defendants then began preparing \nthe paperwork to terminate all other Bureau employees in two \nphases.  Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 129-30 (J.A. 1028-29); see Feb. \n14 Martinez RIF Email (J.A. 539).  Those efforts were paused \nby the district court’s consent order (the effect of which we \nextended in a stay pending decision of this expedited appeal).  \nMartinez meanwhile continued to inform Bureau employees \nthat the Bureau would be closed entirely once the order was \nlifted and it became possible to do so.  Mar. 11 Hearing Tr. 57-\n59 (J.A. 1231-33). \n  Based on those findings of fact, the district court’s factual \nconclusion that Defendants had adopted a policy to eliminate \nthe CFPB is unassailable.  Analogizing again to Biden v. Texas, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 77 of 109\n28 \nimagine if no formal memo had issued but President Biden had \nmade public statements that it was “very important” to have \ngotten rid of the Remain in Mexico program; that Department \nof Homeland Security leadership had ordered employees who \nhad been implementing the policy to cease their activities, \nterminated contracts necessary to carry out the policy, and \nstated that DHS staff responsible for the policy were slated for \ntermination without replacement; and that the Department’s \nChief Operating Officer had informed staff that the policy \nwould  be  formally  terminated  as  soon  as  a  court  order \npreventing them from doing so was lifted.  A court reviewing \nthat  record  would  reasonably  conclude  that  Secretary \nMayorkas had in fact directed the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to terminate the Remain in Mexico program, or that \nthe Department had otherwise adopted a policy of terminating \nthat program.  The district court’s intervention through the \nconsent order and stay to forestall Defendants’ implementation \nof some of the necessary steps to abolish the CFPB does not \nalter the calculus, just as the second memo in Biden v. Texas \nwas a final, reviewable agency action even though it could not \nhave operative effect until an injunction protecting the Remain \nin Mexico policy was lifted.  597 U.S. at 809 n.7. \n  Defendants strenuously deny any intent to shut down the \nBureau, but the evidence they point to regarding their activities \naround February 10—that is, at the time when the district court \nfound that they adopted a binding policy to abolish the CFPB—\nis scarce indeed.  For example, Defendants emphasize that \nPaoletta approved restarting the statutorily required consumer \ncomplaint hotline and publication of data under the Home \nMortgage Disclosure Act after both had ceased pursuant to the \nStop Work Order.  Oral Arg. Tr. 21:19-23.  But Martinez \ntestified  that  such  work  was  restarted  primarily  because \nAgency leadership feared a backlash if public-facing activities \nof the Bureau were to go dark.  Mar. 10 Hearing Tr. 89:2-6, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 78 of 109\n29 \n192:21-25  (J.A.  988,  1091).    The  district  court  dismissed \nDefendants’ limited efforts to restart some workstreams the \nweek  of  February  10  as  too  little,  too  late.    Leadership’s \napprovals were “narrow and grudging,” and “when it was doing \nanything, the agency was largely doing what was statutorily \nmandated to manage itself internally,” not reviving what was \nneeded to carry on the Bureau’s public-protective activities.  \nVought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 65.  The district court’s factfinding \nis dispositive.   \nMore importantly, even as the Bureau took limited steps to \nrestore limited, public-facing functions, any restoration was \nillusory because it remained impossible to run the activities \nostensibly restarted, such as the CFPB Consumer Resource \nCenter’s consumer complaint hotline and database, without the \ncontracts  necessary  to  their  operation.    For  example, \nDefendants had cancelled and not restored five contracts for \ncomponents including systems enabling data sharing, and for \nvirus scanning software, each of which was required for the \ncomplaint hotline’s case management system.  Without the \ncontracts, the hotline could not effectively respond to calls \nfrom members of the public, whether to submit a complaint, \nanswer a question, or provide an update.  See Pfaff Decl. ¶¶ 27-\n30  (J.A.  148-49).    Even  as  Defendants  went  through  the \nmotions of starting to bring a limited set of public-facing \nactivities back online, they simultaneously sought permission \nfrom  OPM  to  permanently  eliminate,  on  an  accelerated \ntimeline, the entirety of the offices and staff responsible for \nmuch of that work.  Memorandum from Adam Martinez to \nMichael J. Mahoney (Feb. 13, 2025) (J.A. 518). \nOn clear error review, we “may not reverse” a district \ncourt’s factual findings that are “plausible in light of the record \nviewed in its entirety.”  Cuddy v. Carmen, 762 F.2d 119, 124 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985).  The government’s counsel insisted at oral \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 79 of 109\n30 \nargument that “there’s a fog of confusion about what’s going \non in the early days” of Vought’s leadership of the Bureau.  \nOral Arg. Tr. 78:13-14.  But the district court found based on \nrecord evidence that Defendants’ actions—stopping essentially \nall of the Bureau’s work, terminating contracts necessary for \nthe CFPB’s operations, preparing to eliminate the entirety of \nthe agency’s staff, and informing staff that the Bureau would \ncease to exist after the court’s order was lifted—resulted from \nan  intentional  effort  to  implement  the  policy  decision \nannounced by the President, the leader of DOGE, and the \nBureau’s own Chief Operating Officer.  That policy decision \nwas to close the CFPB and cease to perform the work that \nCongress created it to perform.  The only other conceivable \nexplanation  would  seem  to  be  recklessness  and  gross \nincompetence,  but  Defendants  have  not  advanced  that \nexplanation. \n  Instead, Defendants principally argue that, even accepting \nthat they attempted to abolish the CFPB in February, they had \nrepudiated any such policy by early March.  See Vought Br. \n49-52.  But Defendants cannot recast the action that forced \nPlaintiffs to file this suit—the shutdown decision that they had \nbegun implementing when the district court acted—solely by \nclaiming to have later changed their minds.  And the evidence \nof such an about-face is, in any event, minimal and failed to \npersuade the district court.  To be sure, on March 2 Paoletta \ninformed Bureau staff that employees had been expected all \nalong to carry out statutorily required work without any prior \npermission.  Mar. 2 Paoletta Email (J.A. 338).  He did not \nexplain  how  that  squared  with  the  Stop  Work  Order’s \nrequirement of prior permission to do essential work, or the tip \nline  to  report  and  stop  any  work  proceeding  without \npermission.  Paoletta’s new order was followed by a flurry of \ndirectives from March 2-3 authorizing staff to perform certain \nrequired  tasks.    Martinez  gestured  at  this  theory  when  he \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 80 of 109\n31 \ntestified that, although “DOGE came in with a very hard fist,” \nthere had since been a “change in posture” and a “differing \napproach[]” once Vought and his deputies—whom Martinez \nreferred  to  as  “the  adults”—were  in  command.    Mar.  10 \nHearing Tr. 23:2-5 (J.A. 922).  Notably, the record contains no \nevidence  that  Defendants  had  in  fact  developed  any  plan \nwhatsoever for running the agency—as opposed to eliminating \nit.  \nThe district court rejected Defendants’ effort to reframe \nthe evidence and the conclusions Defendants insisted could \nflow from it as a “charade for the [c]ourt’s benefit,” given that \nDefendants sent the putative course-correction emails shortly \nbefore the district court’s scheduled hearing on the motion for \na preliminary injunction.  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 11.  \nNeither those emails nor any other evidence in the record could \ngive a reasonable observer a “definite and firm conviction” that \na mistake was made.  Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 309 \n(2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The district court \nwas on solid evidentiary ground when it rejected Defendants’ \ncontentions that the CFPB’s Chief Legal Officer was somehow \nunaware for almost three weeks that the Bureau’s statutorily \nrequired work had halted, and the termination was intended to \nbe permanent.   \nIndeed, Defendants’ continued insistence that the Stop \nWork Order was never intended to pause statutorily required \nwork squarely conflicts with their contemporaneous attempt to \nuse that same Order to justify the accelerated, permanent firing \nof the employees who performed the work that Defendants now \nsay they intended to continue.  And the government could not \neven  stick  to  its  talking  points.    Shortly  after  Paoletta’s \nwhitewashing email, the White House publicly celebrated that \nPresident  Trump  had  “ordered  [the  Bureau]  .  .  .  to  halt \noperations.”  Id. at 47. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 81 of 109\n32 \n   In any event, the argument that Plaintiffs cannot obtain an \ninjunction because, weeks after they filed suit, Defendants took \nsteps to reverse the policy Plaintiffs challenged is at most a \nsuggestion that the case is moot—an argument that Defendants \nare not making, and that is unsupported.  To be sure, federal \ncourts  may  not  resolve  a  case  after  “a  complaining  party \nmanages to secure outside of litigation all the relief he might \nhave won in it,” but it is well established that a defendant may \nnot “automatically moot a case by the simple expedient of \nsuspending its challenged conduct after it is sued.”  FBI v. \nFikre, 601 U.S. 234, 240-41 (2024) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Any defendant seeking to show mootness in such \ncircumstances faces a “formidable burden” to prove that the \nchallenged practice “cannot ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’”  \nId. at 241 (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189-90 (2000)).   \nDefendants have never—not before the district court nor \non appeal—sought to bear their formidable burden to show that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are moot.  Nor have they ever sought to \nmodify or vacate the preliminary injunction on grounds of \nchanged circumstances rendering its continued enforcement no \nlonger equitable.  See Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 447 \n(2009) (holding that a party may move to modify or vacate a \njudgment or order if “a significant change either in factual \nconditions or in law renders continued enforcement detrimental \nto the public interest.”); cf. Petties v. District of Columbia, 662 \nF.3d 564, 571 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  They cannot stitch together \nevidence of what they say is a post-litigation embrace of their \nlegal obligations to recharacterize the record as it existed—\nshowing just the opposite—when the case was filed. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 82 of 109\n33 \nC. \n  Defendants’ efforts to portray Plaintiffs’ claims as, at their \nheart, a miscast attempt to “compel agency action unlawfully \nwithheld,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), fare no better.  Vought Br. 39-\n42.  Throughout this case, Plaintiffs have made clear that they \nchallenge Defendants’ decision to shut down the CFPB rather \nthan seek to compel the performance of any specific agency \nduty or service.  NTEU Br. 35-36.  Defendants insist that \nanticipation of “losing access to services [Plaintiffs] allege \nCFPB is statutorily required to provide” can only support a \nquasi-mandamus  APA  suit  to  compel  agency  action \n“unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.”  Vought Br. \n39; 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  Their insistence that Plaintiffs’ only \nrecourse under the APA must be found in section 706(1) is \nsquarely foreclosed by precedent.  \n  This case challenges the Executive’s unilateral decision to \ndisband  an  agency  Congress  created  by  statute,  not  that \nagency’s failure to answer individual queries or bring certain \nwished-for enforcement actions.  The public that Congress \nintended to benefit is not disallowed from bringing the former \nkind  of  challenge  nor  relegated  exclusively  to  the  latter.  \nRegents illustrates the point.  The plaintiffs there challenged a \nDHS memorandum ordering the termination of the “DACA \nProgram,” which allowed certain undocumented immigrants to \napply for forbearance of removal, work authorization, and \nother federal benefits.  591 U.S. at 8-10.  Those plaintiffs, who \nwould have been harmed by DACA’s abolition, challenged the \norder terminating the program under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), which \npermits courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action.”  \n591 U.S. at 16.  The Supreme Court undertook review in \nRegents and vacated the DHS order.  It did so even though the \nplaintiffs’ claims, which necessarily arose from the harms they \nwould  have  suffered  had  the  agency  failed  to  continue \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 83 of 109\n34 \nimplementing the to-be-cancelled DACA Program, might have \nequally been described as an attempt to compel the agency to \nperform actions unlawfully withheld—such as acting on their \nindividual DACA applications or providing them benefits they \nwould be afforded if they qualified under DACA. \nBiden v. Texas is further support.  Plaintiffs’ APA claim \narose  from  the  injury  they  would  incur  if  DHS  stopped \nenrolling noncitizens in the Remain in Mexico program.  The \nsuit could easily have been framed as an attempt to compel the \nagency to act by continuing those enrollments.  See 597 U.S. at \n793-94.    The  Court  nonetheless  recognized  the  case  as \nchallenging final agency actions that had occurred, and not as \na quasi-mandamus suit to compel actions that plaintiffs claimed \nthe  agency  had  unlawfully  failed  to  take.    Id.  at  807-08.  \nCongress in the APA did not confine persons in Plaintiffs’ \nposition  to  claiming  that  the  agency  must  reconstruct, \npiecemeal and from the bottom up, each of the components of \nthe  terminated  agency  on  which  they  depend  for  specific \nservices or broader legal protections. \n  To  be  sure,  demonstrating  standing  to  challenge  the \nshutting down of the CFPB requires Plaintiffs to show that the \nchallenged agency action causes them harm that likely would \nbe redressed if the challenged action were set aside.  See FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024).  But the \nstanding inquiry—wherein Plaintiffs must identify how they \nbenefit from the Bureau’s activities to support their claim that \nits abolition would injure them by ceasing those activities —\ndoes not somehow transform their section 706(2) challenge to \nthe  CFPB’s  shutdown  into  a  premature  section  706(1) \nchallenge to the Bureau’s failure to provide future services or \nprotection.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 84 of 109\n35 \nNor does it matter that eliminating the CFPB would affect \nPlaintiffs indirectly, rather than regulating their own primary \nconduct.  It is “typical” in APA suits that “[a]n unregulated \nplaintiff” will “challenge an allegedly unlawful agency rule \nthat regulates others but also has adverse downstream effects \non the plaintiff,” and seek to benefit from the court’s broad \npower to vacate unlawful agency actions.  Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBd. Of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 826-27, \n829-30 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \n Defendants’  argument  that  Norton  v.  Southern  Utah \nWilderness Alliance (SUWA), 542 U.S. 55 (2004), forecloses \nPlaintiffs’ suit is wide of the mark.  See Vought Br. 41-43.  \nSUWA held that plaintiffs may not invoke the APA’s compel-\nagency-action provision unless they “assert[] that an agency \nfailed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to \ntake.”  Id. at 64.  SUWA is a section 706(1) case, with little to \nsay regarding the merits of Plaintiffs’ section 706(2) challenge.  \nPlaintiffs have never asked that the court force the CFPB to do \nanything other than vacate its unlawful order to disband the \nagency.  Defendants’ objections that, in doing so, Plaintiffs \nmust nonetheless identify a “specific, unequivocal command” \nproducing a “clear duty” for the agency to act in the manner \nPlaintiffs desire similarly carry no weight.  See Vought Br. 43 \n(citations omitted).  Defendants have never disputed that the \nBureau is unambiguously legally obliged not to shut itself \ndown.   \nAnd, in the posture of a 706(2) suit, a plaintiff is free to \nchallenge an agency’s decision to halt ongoing operations even \nwhen  there  is  no  dispute  that  those  activities  were  not \nspecifically statutorily required.  See Regents, 591 U.S. at 16 \n(noting that “[a]ll parties” agreed that the government was not \nlegally obliged to continue DACA).  Of course, the CFPB’s \nexistence and operation is statutorily required, but Defendants’ \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 85 of 109\n36 \nactions would be subject to review even if it were not.  One \ncentral function of the 706(2) cause of action is to ensure that, \neven  when  agencies  take  (or  refrain  from)  action  that  the \nagency’s own statute leaves in their discretion, the agencies \nmust comply with the fundamental requirement of reasoned \ndecision making.  The fact that Congress permits agencies a \ndegree of discretion in what action to take does not invite \nagencies to act arbitrarily, without forethought, transparency, \nor public comment on the decisions they choose.  And it surely \ndoes not insulate from review an agency’s decision to unwind \nitself.   \nD. \n  Defendants  also  argue  that  Plaintiffs  are  barred  from \nmounting an APA challenge to the order to shut down the \nCFPB  because  their  requested  relief  is  impermissibly \n“programmatic.”  Vought Br. 21-22.  It is uncontroversial that \nplaintiffs “cannot seek wholesale improvement of [an agency] \nprogram by court decree,” but must instead “direct [their] \nattack  against  some  particular  ‘agency  action’  that  causes \n[them] harm.”  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 891 \n(1990).    If  Plaintiffs’  argument  were  that  Defendants’ \nmanagement of the Bureau is too lax, inattentive, or lethargic, \nthat dispute would presumably have to be resolved “in the \noffices  of  the  [Bureau]  or  the  halls  of  Congress,  where \nprogrammatic  improvements  are  normally  made.”    Id.  \nSimilarly,  even  though  the  management  of  an  agency  is, \nnecessarily,  made  up  of  various  discrete  actions,  many  of \nwhich might be subject to APA challenge, a plaintiff cannot \nmount a “generic challenge to all aspects of [the agency’s] \nprogram”  by  aggregating  ongoing  and  changing  agency \noperations into a package they label a discrete, reviewable \naction.  Id. at 890 n.2.  The Court in Lujan accordingly rejected \nplaintiffs’ efforts to mount an APA section 706(2) challenge, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 86 of 109\n37 \nas parties “aggrieved” under section 702 by the Bureau of Land \nManagement’s “land withdrawal review program.”  Id. at 890.  \nThe Court explained that the “program” plaintiffs identified \nwas not an “identifiable agency action” but only “the name by \nwhich  petitioners  have  occasionally  referred  to”  BLM’s \nongoing “operations . . . in reviewing withdrawal revocation \napplications  and  the  classifications  of  public  lands  and \ndeveloping  land  use  plans  as  required  by  [statute].”    Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \n  This case, challenging a distinct agency decision of major \nlegal and practical import, bears no resemblance to the diffuse \ncollection of agency activities at issue in Lujan.  Defendants \nweakly contest the factual footing of Plaintiffs’ claim that \nDefendants adopted a policy to terminate the CFPB, but that \nchallenge fails for reasons already discussed.  See supra Part \nIII.B.  Defendants cannot achieve the same result by treating \nLujan  as  if  it  were  a  thread  they  can  pull  to  unravel  the \nestablished APA cause of action that Plaintiffs invoke here.  \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  That APA cause of action is available \nto challenge Defendants’ highly focused agency action.  It is \nnot  defeated  under  Lujan  because  the  action  has  broad \neffects—effects  that  might  even  be  fairly  labeled  as \n“programmatic”—across all the Bureau’s operations.  Nothing \nin Lujan supports Defendants’ contention that the decision by \nCFPB’s new leadership to abolish the Bureau is unreviewable \nunder section 706(2) to determine whether it was arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with law. \nIndeed, Lujan itself underscored in no uncertain terms that \nplaintiffs may challenge a specific action “applying . . . across \nthe board to all [land] classification terminations,” even though \n“the entire ‘land withdrawal review program,’ insofar as the \ncontent of that particular action is concerned, would thereby be \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 87 of 109\n38 \naffected.”  497 U.S. at 890 n.2.  It is hard to imagine an agency \naction  that  more  clearly  applies  “across  the  board”  to  all \nensuing agency operations than an order to terminate an agency \nentirely.  That conclusion is confirmed by the Supreme Court’s \ntreatment of the challenges to the termination of the DACA and \nRemain in Mexico programs as justiciable APA challenges to \ndiscrete, reviewable agency action, rather than impermissible \nprogrammatic challenges to the general way the defendant \nagencies  intended  to  oversee  those  programs.    Defendants \ncannot evade judicial review of their unlawful action simply \nbecause their adopted policy’s effects are complicated and will \nhave comprehensive, programmatic impact on how the agency \ndoes  (or,  more  to  the  point  here,  does  not)  carry  out  its \nobligations.  Plaintiffs have a cause of action to challenge under \nthe APA the decision to terminate the CFPB’s activities and \nshut down the agency. \nE. \nThe majority embraces every argument Defendants make \nas reason to defeat Plaintiffs’ statutory cause of action.  After \nsummarizing  well-accepted  guidelines  constraining  judicial \nreview of agency action, my colleagues object that: \n•  Plaintiffs have not identified a specific rule or “agency \nstatement”  authorizing  the  Bureau’s  shutdown, \nMajority Op. 29 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) and adding \nemphasis);  \n•  any  shutdown  order  was  not  final  because  ensuing \nagency  actions  like  contract  terminations  and  RIFs \nwould need to occur before the decision would be fully \nimplemented, Majority Op. 30;  \n•  shutting down the Bureau is “insufficiently discrete” to \nmerit judicial review because the CFPA itself provides \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 88 of 109\n39 \nno structure for the Bureau’s exercise of that power, \nMajority Op. 31;  \n•  preventing  the  CFPB’s  unlawful  abolition  would \nrequire overly intrusive judicial management of the \nBureau’s functions, Majority Op. 31-32; and  \n•  any shutdown was not ripe for review because, they \nsay, Defendants have reevaluated their plans since the \nweek  of  February  10—despite  the  district  court’s \nexplicit findings to the contrary, Majority Op. 33-34; \nsee Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 58. \nI have already explained why none of those hurdles applies to \njustify vacating the preliminary injunction.  \nThe keystone on which all of Defendants’ attacks on the \npreliminary  injunction  rest  is  a  much  simpler,  singular \nassertion.    Their  unifying  premise  is  that  an  agency \ncategorically immunizes its exercise of power from judicial \nreview by refraining from memorializing its directives as such.  \nAfter all, each of Defendants’ other reasons for asserting that \nPlaintiffs lack a cause of action would, in theory, equally apply \nif the record showed that, on or around February 10, Vought \nsent a memo to Paoletta and other members of the Bureau’s \nleadership directing them to take “all appropriate actions” to \nabolish  the  CFPB  in  defiance  of  Congress’s  command \notherwise.   \nAs discussed above, even an authoritative written memo \nwould, on Defendants’ view, require further agency action to \nimplement it to the detriment of Plaintiffs or other interested \nparties before Plaintiffs could bring an APA challenge to the \npolicy it memorializes.  Such a memo would not derive from \nany  specific  “authoritative  text”  that  might  help  structure \njudicial review—at least if the majority is right that “no statute \nor  regulation  authorizes  the  CFPB  to  shut  itself  down.”  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 89 of 109\n40 \nMajority Op. 31.  It is also quite possible that, by the time a \ncourt  vacates  an  unlawful  shutdown  decision,  agency \nleadership might in the meantime have decided to pursue a \ndifferent policy.  But binding precedent is unambiguous that \nsuch  a  shutdown  order,  if  shown  to  be  unlawful,  can  be \nreviewed  in  court  and  vacated  or  “set  aside.”  And, \nnotwithstanding the majority’s catalogue of hurdles, I do not \nunderstand my colleagues to disagree with that.  Rather, the \nmajority ultimately rests on distinguishing Biden v. Texas and \nRegents—both of which permitted judicial review of shutdown \norders  despite  sharing  the  difficulties  the  majority  also \ncatalogues—on the ground that those cases involved “written \nmemoranda.”  Majority Op. 38. \n  The issue, then, is what weight should be placed on the \nabsence of any such memo in the record here.  To analogize to \nRegents, consider the dilemma of a district court seeking to \nfollow the majority’s approach in that case if there were no \nmemo, but the record included unrebutted statements by the \nPresident and agency leadership that the DACA program had \nbeen abolished, testimony of DHS employees that they had \nbeen told that the program was being abolished, and evidence \nthat all the employees and contracts necessary for the program \nhad been terminated such that the program was not in fact being \nimplemented.  The majority does not explain why the result \nshould  be  different  on  that  record  for  want  of  “written \nmemoranda”  reflecting  the  order  that  DHS  staff  abolish \nDACA.  Majority Op. 38.  Defendants, for their part, appear to \nsuggest that the district court, even if certain that the DACA \nprogram had been unlawfully abolished, would lack authority \nto  enjoin  its  termination,  and  could  only  encourage  the \nplaintiffs to file quasi-mandamus suits under section 706(1) to \nattempt to force the agency to recreate the program piecemeal.  \nI cannot agree. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 90 of 109\n41 \n  To begin with, consider the illogic and perverse incentives \ninherent  in  adopting  Defendants’  preferred  approach.    My \ncolleagues suggest the ability of any affected plaintiff to obtain \nrelief turns entirely on the form of the evidence establishing the \nagency’s  action.    But  there  is  no  substantive  distinction \nbetween a termination of a program triggered by a formal \nmemo  decreeing  it  and  one  mandated  without  such \nmemorialization:  Even if Plaintiffs could proffer a memo, the \nagency “action” we review would be the same agency closure, \nnot the preparation or circulation of the memo.  And the import \nof the availability of a memo for the judicial review process is \nprimarily evidentiary.  In either case, the legality of any such \nshutdown turns on the agency’s statutory authority to abolish \nthe  program  at  issue,  and  perhaps  on  the  agency’s \ncontemporaneous reasons for doing so, rather than on whether \nthe termination happened by memo, email, or verbal directive.  \nThe majority relies on Biden v. Texas and Regents for its \npreferred rule, Majority Op. 37-39, but nothing in those cases \nsuggests that the written nature of the program terminations at \nissue was pivotal to their outcomes.  Because the government \nthere had proceeded in the ordinary fashion by announcing \nmajor policy changes via written directives, the Court naturally \nrelied on those documents in identifying the relevant agency \naction.  (We would have, too.)  Neither decision, however, \npurported to hold that “final, written memoranda” were always \nnecessary for agency action.  Majority Op. 38.  To the contrary:  \nRegents explained that the “action [that] provide[d] a focus for \njudicial  review”  was  the  “creation”  of  DACA  and  its \n“rescission,” not the written memorandum.  591 U.S. at 18 \n(quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985)).  And \nBiden held only that, where a formal memorandum terminating \nRemain in Mexico did exist, it served as the “operative agency \naction[]” because it qualified as a rule on its own terms and \n“bound  [agency]  staff  by  forbidding  them  to  continue  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 91 of 109\n42 \nprogram in any way from that moment on.”  597 U.S. at \n808-09, 810 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(4)).  It strains credulity to think that either outcome \nwould have been different had DHS proceeded as the CFPB \ndid here, rather than by memorializing its decisions.  In holding \nas much, the panel majority essentially punches a hole in the \n“basic  presumption  of  judicial  review”  of  agency  action \ncodified  in  the  APA,  McLaughlin  Chiropractic  Assocs.  v. \nMcKesson  Corp.,  145  S.  Ct.  2006,  2015  (2025)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted), to the benefit of agencies that, for \nwhatever reason, proceed without a record of their reasoning or \nformal public notice that leaves a paper trail.  \nThat said, the majority’s rule remains somewhat unclear.  \nIn attempting to distinguish Biden v. Texas and Regents from \nthis case, the opinion emphasizes the presence in those cases of \n“written  memoranda,”  Majority  Op.  38,  but  it  elsewhere \nsuggests that even an “informal” or “oral” statement might \nsuffice, Majority Op. 29, 41.  Certainly, this case would be \nmore  straightforward  if  Defendants  had  announced  in  the \nFederal Register their decision to close the CFPB.  But the \nmajority does not make clear why the record here fails to satisfy \neven its own newfound rule.  If it does not, what would?  An \nemail from Vought stating that the decision had been made to \nclose the agency?  The same announcement at an all-staff \nmeeting?  A press conference where the decision is made \npublic?    In  my  view,  agency  leadership’s  mode  of \ncommunicating its decision to abolish the agency—a decision \nthe  district  court  found  was  made—does  not  change  the \ndecision’s susceptibility to APA review.  It is the agency’s \ndecision itself that is the focus of our review. \nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiffs lack an APA section \n706(2) cause of action is also wholly at odds with the basic \npurpose of administrative law to ensure that agency actions are \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 92 of 109\n43 \n“the  product  of  reasoned  decisionmaking,”  Motor  Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 52 \n(1983), and that an agency “clearly disclose[]” its reasons for \nacting as it does, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94 \n(1943).  That is why, for example, agencies cannot act and then \ndefend their actions with justifications developed after the fact.  \nId. at 94-95; see, e.g., Regents, 591 U.S. at 20.  That is also why \nit  counts  strongly  against  an  agency  when,  in  a  judicial \nproceeding challenging the agency’s action, the record shows \nthat the agency concealed its true reasons for acting.  See Dep’t \nof Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019).  Defendants \nargue—and my colleagues now appear to hold—that if the \nagency not only conceals its reasons for acting, but obfuscates \nwhat it is doing while it acts, it may thereby immunize its \noperations from judicial review.  There is no plausible reason \nwhy  Congress  would  have  wanted  to  afford  less  judicial \nscrutiny  to  executive  agencies  when  they  make  critical \ndecisions—including  shutting  down  an  agency  created  by \nstatute—without any publicly available, lawful, nonarbitrary \nreasoning to justify them. \n  To be sure, an APA section 706(2) cause of action is \ndefinitionally limited to its statutory scope.  If Congress had in \nfact provided for judicial review only insofar as a final agency \naction is effectuated by a clear, written directive, then I would \ncredit Defendants’ argument.  But Congress did no such thing.  \nThe relevant statutory provision defines an agency action as \n“includ[ing] the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, \nlicense,  sanction,  relief,  or  the  equivalent . . . thereof.”    5 \nU.S.C. § 551(13) (emphasis added).   \nMy colleagues affirm that the Bureau’s action shutting \nitself down would be reviewable under section 706(2) if there \nwere a memo or oral announcement directing it.  See Majority \nOp. 40-41.  But they offer no reason why the agency’s doing \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 93 of 109\n44 \nthe  same  thing  without  the  overarching  announcement \nnecessarily falls outside of Congress’s residual reference to \n“equivalent”  types  of  agency  action.    5  U.S.C.  § 551(13).  \nInstead, they fall back on the reference to a “statement” in the \nstatutory definition of an agency “rule.”  Majority Op. 29 n.5 \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(4)).  That bears, at most, on whether \nthe form of action shutting down the CFPB was an agency \n“rule.”  It does nothing to establish that every type of agency \naction—whether “rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the \nequivalent . . . thereof,”  5  U.S.C.  § 551(13)—must  be \nencapsulated in a “statement” to be subject to judicial review.  \nBy barring review of the decision to shut down the Bureau for \nwant of a memorandum or “statement” announcing it, the court \nwithout  comment  reads  “the  equivalent . . . thereof”  out  of \nCongress’s intentionally capacious definition of agency action.  \nSee id.   \n  The majority further cabins the APA by holding that a \n“collection of disparate agency actions” is not a fit focus of \njudicial review, and characterizing the decision to shut down \nthe Bureau as just such an unreviewable amalgam.  Majority \nOp. 41.  But Plaintiffs challenge a single action—the shutdown \ndecision—as to which a collection of different agency actions \nis probative evidence.  Nothing about those actions themselves \nis “disparate.”  Rather, the record reflects a concerted and \ncoordinated  campaign  undertaken  by  agency  leadership \nsimultaneously to dismantle every functional requisite of the \nBureau’s, with all steps keyed to the single goal stated publicly \nby the President and his subordinates: “get[ting] rid of” the \nCFPB.  See supra pp. 26-27.  That is a far cry from a random \nassortment  of  “disparate  agency  actions”  or  a  “secret,” \n“unrecorded,” or “[u]nexpressed” shutdown decision made by \na single agency head.  Majority Op. 29 n.5, 41.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 94 of 109\n45 \nNor is there anything “oxymoronic” about recognizing that \nan “unrecorded” agency action could be the subject of APA \nreview.  Majority Op. 41.  The expansive statutory definition \nof “agency action” is designed to reach situations in which \nagencies adopt an “equivalent” of any of the most common \ntypes of agency action without necessarily making the formal \n“statement” typical of an agency rule.  The declarations by the \nPresident and his subordinates of their objective, together with \nswift  and  near-complete  execution,  suffices  anyway  as  “a \nstatement” of the agency’s decision.  That no prior case has \nreviewed such a situation speaks only to the unprecedented \nnature of the government’s actions here. \nIn any event, we do not interpret the APA’s text on a blank \nslate.  The Supreme Court has explained that “agency action” \nas used in the APA is “meant to cover comprehensively every \nmanner in which an agency may exercise its power.”  Am. \nTrucking, 531 U.S. at 478; see FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of \nCalif., 449 U.S. 232, 238 n.7 (1980).  When this circuit has \nidentified agency action as outside that “broad sweep,” we have \ndone so because the action complained of had no “concrete \nimpact . . . whatsoever” and “imposed no obligations and \ndenied no relief.”  Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass’n v. EPA, 372 \nF.3d 420, 427 (2004).  It is self-evident that an agency acting \nto eliminate itself is an “exercise [of] its power” with “concrete \nimpact[s].”  Such an action is, moreover, “discrete” in the same \nway a rule is.  SUWA, 542 U.S. at 62.  \nThe majority disclaims resting on the absence of a memo \nalone, Majority Op. 41, noting that even an unstated action \nwould have to bind the agency to be final and reviewable, and \nasserting that Vought’s decision to shut down the CFPB was \nnot binding, Majority Op. 41-42.  The district court, however, \nfound precisely the opposite.  After a two-day evidentiary \nhearing, it found that the “consequences” of the shutdown \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 95 of 109\n46 \ndecision were “swift”: employees understood that they were to \nstand down entirely from their tasks, sweeping terminations of \njob positions and contracts quickly followed (with the rest to \nfollow soon thereafter), and the day-to-day operation of the \nBureau ground to a halt.  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 44-46, \n58-60.  To conclude otherwise, the majority would have to \nestablish that those factual findings were clearly erroneous, a \nstep it pointedly does not take.  And the facts rule out the \nmajority’s alternative embrace of Defendants’ assertion that no \npurported shutdown decision was ever finalized.  Majority Op. \n33-34, 41-42.  The district court found that the last-minute \nactions Defendants highlight were mere “window dressing” \nahead of the impending preliminary-injunction hearing, not \nproof that no shutdown decision had been made.  Vought, 774 \nF. Supp. 3d at 11.   \nPerhaps the majority means that the elimination of an \nagency is “agency action,” but it is not “final” unless it is \ncommunicated  or  memorialized  with  sufficient  levels  of \nformality.    I  doubt  it,  though,  as  that  position  is  legally \nunsupported and makes no sense on its own terms.  What \nmakes an agency action “final,” and thus reviewable, is that it \n“mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess” and is an action “by which rights or obligations have \nbeen determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (citations omitted).  If an agency \npromptly  shuts  itself  down  in  response  to  its  leadership’s \nadoption of a policy to that effect, that action both concludes \nthe decision-making process and produces legal consequences.  \nThat is true even if the agency leaders fail to commemorate \ntheir decision with a formal announcement. \nBinding  precedent  reaffirms  that  commonsense \nunderstanding of the scope of APA review.  In Venetian Casino \nResort, we held that an agency takes final, reviewable action \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 96 of 109\n47 \nby  “adopting  [a]  policy”  that  has  legal  consequences, \nregardless of whether or how that policy’s adoption is written \ndown.  530 F.3d at 931.  Defendants do not dispute that basic \nprinciple.  They accept that we may “infer from circumstantial \nevidence that there’s a decision,” such as the adoption of a \npolicy, subject to judicial review.  Oral Arg. Tr. 78:6-7.  The \ndistrict court’s finding of just such a decision is enough to meet \nthat standard.  The majority nonetheless endeavors to skirt \nVenetian Casino Resort’s binding holding.  It argues that, \nunlike here, “the policy at issue there was recorded repeatedly, \nin different versions of an agency compliance manual,” and \nthus “qualified as a rule.”  Majority Op. 36 (emphasis omitted).  \nThat is not quite right.  We were explicit in Venetian Casino \nResort  that  the  final  agency  action  at  issue  consisted  of \n“adopting the policy” of disclosing confidential information \nwithout notice, “not . . . including it in the [m]anual.”  530 F.3d \nat 931 (emphasis added).  And nowhere did we hint that it \nmattered to our holding whether the statements in the manual \nseparately  qualified  as  a  “rule.”    To  the  contrary,  we \nemphasized that the relevant agency action under review was \n“the decision of the Commission to adopt a policy,” not “the \n[m]anual itself.”  Id.   \nThe majority also insists that Venetian Casino Resort is \ndistinguishable  because  the  court  there  reviewed  the \npolicy only when “EEOC was on the cusp of applying it to \nharm the plaintiff,” so  the policy “implicated  none of the \nfinality or ripeness concerns associated with the shutdown \ndecision here.”  Majority Op. 36-37.  The district court here, \nhowever, found that Defendants had already gone beyond “the \ncusp” of applying their policy decision against Plaintiffs—the \npolicy’s implementation was well underway and in overdrive \nat the time of the initial consent order.  See Vought, 774 F. \nSupp. 3d at 58-61.  Besides, finality and ripeness are distinct \nfrom the separate requirement of “agency action,” so they \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 97 of 109\n48 \nprovide no reason to distinguish Venetian Casino Resort on \nthat basis. \nThe majority ultimately relies on language from Biden v. \nTexas cautioning against “reviewing an abstract decision apart \nfrom specific agency action, as defined in the APA.”  597 U.S. \nat 809; see Majority Op. 28-29 & n.5, 38-39.  But nobody is \nsuggesting that Plaintiffs may obtain judicial review of an \n“abstract decision” that is not final agency action—i.e., that is \nnot “the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, \nsanction,  relief,  or  the  equivalent . . . thereof,”  5  U.S.C. \n§ 551(13),  and  is  not  also  an  action  “by  which  rights  or \nobligations  have  been  determined,  or  from  which  legal \nconsequences will flow.”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (citation \nomitted).  The Supreme Court applied that test to identify the \nfinal agency action in Biden v. Texas, and it equally applies \nhere to defeat the suggestion that Plaintiffs lack a cause of \naction under section 706(2). \nThe finality issue in Biden v. Texas arose because, after \nSecretary  Mayorkas’s  first  memorandum  terminating  the \nRemain in Mexico program was enjoined by a district court, \nwhich “found that the agency failed to engage in reasoned \ndecisionmaking and therefore acted arbitrarily and capriciously \nin  violation  of  the  APA,”  the  agency  “considered  anew” \nwhether to terminate the program.  597 U.S. at 794-95 (citation \nomitted).  The agency then released a second memorandum that \nalso  ordered  the  abolition  of  the  program  but  included \nadditional explanation of the agency’s reasons.  Id.  The Fifth \nCircuit refused to treat the second memorandum (with its more \ndetailed reasoning) as a separate reviewable action, holding \ninstead that it only “explained” the decision the agency had \nalready made by terminating the Remain in Mexico program \nthe first time.  Id. at 796-97 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nThat was error.  The Supreme Court recognized that the agency \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 98 of 109\n49 \ntook one final, reviewable action by terminating the program \nthrough the first memo, and then elected to “tak[e] new agency \naction” after its first action was enjoined in court.  Id. at 807-08 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The Fifth Circuit should \nnot have ignored the second action or treated it only “as post \nhoc rationalizations” of the first action, as if the object of \nreview were some underlying “abstract decision” to abolish the \nRemain in Mexico program, rather than an actual final agency \naction under the APA.  Id. at 809-10. \nWhat follows is that Plaintiffs must identify the agency \naction that is the subject of their APA challenge.  Plaintiffs \nhave done so.  They do not deny that an “abstract decision” on \nthe part of Vought or another agency leader to abolish the \nCFPB at some point in the future would be unlikely to qualify \nas final and reviewable.  Even decisive identification of a \npossible future action is unlikely to count as an exercise of \nagency authority, and it is hard to see how any such decision, \nby  itself,  would  create  rights,  obligations,  or  legal \nconsequences.  What Biden v. Texas shows is that, if Plaintiffs \nprevail in this suit, any future decision Defendants might take \nto abolish the CFPB is likely to be a distinct agency action, \nreviewable on its own terms.   \nBut it decidedly does not follow from Biden v. Texas, \nwhere no such issue was before the Court, that an agency could \ncategorically evade judicial review by declining to write down \nits directives on paper.  Nothing in Biden v. Texas is fairly read \nto cast doubt on Venetian Casino Resort’s holding that an \nagency’s  adoption  of  a  policy  with  binding,  legal  effect \nqualifies as reviewable agency action.  And, as previously \nnoted, I strongly doubt the Supreme Court in Biden v. Texas \nunderstood itself as holding that Secretary Mayorkas could \nhave abolished the Remain in Mexico program entirely without \nexposing the agency to judicial review through the simple \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 99 of 109\n50 \nexpedient of proceeding directly to the program’s shutdown \nwithout first drafting any memo.  The majority’s oblique hint \nto the contrary does not suffice to avoid the binding effect of \nVenetian Casino Resort’s holding on the scope of reviewable \nagency action, nor has the majority claimed any prerogative not \nto follow it. \nThe majority additionally sees a supposed “mismatch” \nbetween “the final agency action inferred” (i.e., the shutdown \ndecision) “and the remedy provided” (i.e., enjoining or setting \naside the “constellation of discrete actions” comprising the \nshutdown).  Majority Op. 42.  But that would equally have \nprevented review in Regents and Biden v. Texas, as each case \nlikewise challenged termination of programs that could readily \nhave been described as constellations of discrete components.  \nTerminating  DACA,  for  instance,  involved  halting  work \nauthorizations, ending eligibility for Medicaid, and providing \nnew enforcement guidance to ICE.  See Regents, 591 U.S. at \n18-19.  But the Court did not hold that review must be had, if \nat  all,  via  quasi-mandamus  suits  under  section  706(1).    It \nunderstood that the decision to terminate a program is itself an \nagency action reviewable under section 706(2).  The same \nreasoning controls here. \nPerhaps most worryingly, the upshot of the government’s \nand  the  majority’s  position  is  that  an  agency  may  either \ncompletely  evade  judicial  review  of  its  activities—or, \ntechnically, face challenges only under section 706(1)’s inapt \nstandard—if it can just keep its shutdown plans non-public \nuntil they are fait accompli.  Defendants do not deny that a \nunilateral  Executive  Branch  decision  to  shut  down  CFPB \nwould be unlawful.  They focus instead on attacking Plaintiffs’ \nright to challenge their action because—at least as far as we \nnow know—they decided on the challenged action without the \nkind of memorialization the majority requires.  In adopting \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 100 of 109\n51 \nDefendants’ preferred gloss on the APA, the majority does not \nappear to consider that an agency determined to perform an act \nof dubious legality might be disinclined to publicly announce \nwhat it has determined to do.   \nRather  than  grapple  with  the  perverse  incentives  its \ndecision  creates,  the  majority  insists  that  section  706(1) \nprovides an adequate avenue for judicial review of termination \ndecisions not formally announced that result in withholding or \nunreasonably delaying mandatory agency action.  Majority Op. \n39 n.8.  But a section 706(1) remedy is insufficient here for all \nthe reasons previously explained.  See supra Part III.C.  To re-\nemphasize just one, it provides no relief to plaintiffs injured by \nthe  agency’s  complete  abdication  of  its  duties  in  matters \ncommitted to its general discretion—that is, the bulk of what \nthe Bureau was set up to do.  To its credit, the majority rightly \nassumes that the CFPB “must engage in some regulation of, \nsay,  the  Nation’s  largest  banks,”  Majority  Op.  27  (citing \nChaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4), even though its rulemaking, \nenforcement, and adjudicatory authorities are discretionary.  \nSee 12 U.S.C. §§ 5512(b)(1), 5531(b), 5562, 5563(a).  It is \nanyone’s guess how that acknowledgement—which is surely \ncorrect—squares with the majority’s insistence that section \n706(1) is the only avenue for judicial review. \nThe government’s preference for a rule that empowers an \nagency to stymie meaningful APA review of presumptively \nunlawful action is clear.  How their approach squares with the \nAPA’s provision for judicial review of agency action remains, \nat least to me, entirely obscure.  Defendants seek effective \nimmunity from meaningful oversight in the federal courts of \neven the most consequential actions by agencies, provided the \nagencies manage to obfuscate the scope and reasons for their \naction—and perhaps the reality that they are acting at all.  The \ncourt’s decision to endorse the government’s attack on the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 101 of 109\n52 \ndistrict court’s preliminary injunction is incompatible with the \ncore principles underlying APA review and, more generally, \ncorrosive of the rule of law. \nIV. \n  Even if Plaintiffs lacked a cause of action under the APA, \nthey have an independent claim under the Constitution against \nthe  Executive’s  unilateral  action  to  shut  down  the  CFPB.  \nDefendants  do  not  dispute  the  general,  well-established \nprinciple that a plaintiff who is injured by unconstitutional \ngovernment action may sue to enjoin it even if the action is not \nalso amenable to suit under the APA.  See Dalton v. Specter, \n511 U.S. 462, 469 (1994); Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 190 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006); see also Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 \n(1988).  That principle applies “without regard to the particular \nconstitutional provisions at issue,” including to a “separation-\nof-powers  claim.”    Free  Enter.  Fund  v.  Pub.  Co.  Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010). \n  Defendants  maintain  that  this  case  concerns  solely \nstatutory claims.  Plaintiffs point out that the legal authority to \neliminate an agency Congress created rests with Congress, so \neliminating the agency by unilateral Executive Branch policy \nchoice unconstitutionally usurps congressional power.  Only \nCongress can repeal its own enactments.  But in Defendants’ \nview,  that  constitutional  argument  merely  repackages \nPlaintiffs’ allegations that abolishing the Bureau would violate \nthe agency’s organic statute.  Vought Reply Br. 17-18. \nDefendants rest principally on Dalton.  A plaintiff has a \nconstitutional claim, they assert, only insofar as an executive \nofficial  either  relies  solely  on  an  invocation  of  inherent \nconstitutional authority, or “on a statute that itself violates the \nConstitution.”  Vought Reply Br. 17.  Challenges to all other \nexecutive activity must be treated as statutory, constrained by \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 102 of 109\n53 \nthe availability of statutory causes of action and the limits of \nultra  vires  review,  and  subject  to  resolution  by  statutory \ninterpretation alone.   \nThat  analysis  misapprehends  the  nature  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claim.  Defendants seek to equate this case to \nDalton, but Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. \n579 (1952), is the better analogue.  The power Plaintiffs allege \nDefendants arrogate to themselves is undisputably beyond the \nExecutive’s  legitimate  reach:    Neither  Defendants  nor  my \ncolleagues  have  ever  suggested  that  Defendants  have  any \nstatutory authority—under any statute—to eliminate the CFPB \nunilaterally.    This  case  is  therefore  unlike  Dalton,  which \naffirmed  the  statutory  character  of  a  challenge  to  the \nPresident’s exercise of a statutory base-closing power where \nthe plaintiffs’ only objection was that he failed to follow certain \nstatutorily prescribed procedures when doing so.  Rather, like \nYoungstown, this case “involve[s] the conceded absence of any \nstatutory  authority”  to  undertake  the  challenged  action.  \nDalton, 511 U.S. at 473.  The majority, for its part, avoids that \nclear parallel only by repeating the error that plagues its APA \nanalysis:  it insists that the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ complaint is \nthat  the  Executive  failed  to  “take  care”  that  the  Bureau \nperformed its statutorily mandated duties, Majority Op. 49, an \nequitable constitutional claim it reads Dalton to foreclose.  As \npreviously  explained,  that  framing  misconstrues  the  issue.  \nPlaintiffs object not to the cessation of discrete and mandatory \nagency duties, but to the decision to shutter an agency created \nby Congress—an action for which the President’s authority, if \nit is to exist at all, “must be found in . . . the Constitution.”  \nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 587. \nFor like reasons, this circuit’s recent decision in Global \nHealth Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, \n2025), is inapposite.  That case concerned the claim that the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 103 of 109\n54 \nPresident’s  impoundment  of  congressionally  appropriated \nforeign-aid funds violated the separation of powers.  Slip op. \n15.    Relying  on  Dalton,  the  panel  majority  rejected  that \nequitable  constitutional  claim  as  essentially  statutory  in \ncharacter.  See id. at 18-24.  Notably, however, Congress has \ndelegated  authority to the President, via the Impoundment \nControl Act, to propose rescissions or deferrals of appropriated \nfunds.  Id. at 6-7 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.).  In Global \nHealth Council, therefore—as in Dalton—a statute directly \ncontemplated the presidential action under consideration.  See \nGlobal Health Council, No. 25-5097, slip op. at 20-21.  Here, \nby contrast, no statute contemplates that the Executive might \nshutter an agency created by Congress—much less authorizes \nhim to do so.   In ordering the Bureau to shut down, the \nPresident did not act in “excess” of a specific statutory power, \nDalton,  511  U.S.  at  472;  he  acted  without  any  statutory \nauthorization whatsoever. \nThis case differs from Youngstown only in that President \nTruman  conceded  in  Youngstown  that  he  had  ordered  the \nnationalization  of  the  steel  mills  but  sought  to  defend  his \nconstitutional authority to do so.  343 U.S. at 585-87.  But \nDefendants  here  simply  deny  the  action—ordering  the \nelimination of the CFPB—that the district court found they had \nundertaken without any authority, conditional or otherwise, \nfrom  Congress.    Nowhere,  before  the  district  court  or  on \nappeal,  have  Defendants  identified  any  statutory  or \nconstitutional authority that permits them to shut down the \nCFPB.  Nor have they disputed that unilaterally abolishing the \nBureau would “amount[] to lawmaking, a legislative function \nwhich the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress \nand not to the President.”  Id. at 582. \n  To  show  how  Youngstown’s  framework  applies  here, \nassume that, although he acknowledged the lack of any statute \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 104 of 109\n55 \nor constitutional provision authorizing him alone to nationalize \nthe steel mills, President Truman simply denied having ordered \nany nationalization.  If a court found that, Truman’s denials to \nthe contrary, he had in fact issued such an order, would the \ncourt lack authority to invalidate his action as a violation of the \nconstitutional separation of powers?  The order’s constitutional \ndefect would be identical to the defect in the actual Youngstown \ncase, unaltered by Truman’s hypothetical litigation strategy of \ndisputing the facts rather than the constitutional character of the \narrogation of power.   \nDefendants’ apparent theory here is that courts may only \nreview under the Constitution action of executive officers who \nexplicitly and exclusively invoke constitutional authority for \ntheir  conduct.    That  theory  is  artificially  cramped  and \nindefensible.  Its implicit premise is that any constitutional \nclaim evaporates if officers simply deny having taken an action \nthat all recognize as indisputably unconstitutional.  Any rule \nthat  so  richly  rewards  deceptive  Executive  Branch \ngamesmanship  has  a  burden  of  justification  unmet  here.  \nPlaintiffs claim and the district court found that Defendants \nexercised a power that no statute delegates to them and that all \nparties  agree  is  not  theirs  under  the  Constitution,  but \nCongress’s.  Equity therefore permits plaintiffs injured by the \nexercise of such a power to seek to have it enjoined in federal \ncourt. \n  The  majority  credits  Defendants’  effort  to  distinguish \nYoungstown  because  that  “dispute . . . was  entirely \nconstitutional.”  Majority Op. 48.  But, again, the Youngstown \ndispute was only more obviously “constitutional” than this one \ninsofar as President Truman acknowledged that he exercised a \npower of disputed constitutionality, rather than denying that he \nwielded a power of undisputed unconstitutionality.  Just as \nplaintiffs  may  not  “plead  around”  Dalton’s  limitations  by \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 105 of 109\n56 \nrecasting a statutory claim as a constitutional one, Majority Op. \n49 n.11, so, too, the Executive may not neuter an implied \nconstitutional  claim  through  obfuscatory  litigation  tactics.  \nNeither Youngstown nor Dalton requires us to so reward an \nagency for acting without the transparency the law demands \nfrom our government. \nV. \nIt  suffices  to  resolve  this  appeal  that  we  decide \nDefendants’ attacks on Plaintiffs’ standing and cause of action.  \nBut  it  is  worth  underscoring  what  is  not  raised  here.  \nDefendants have never argued that unilateral action to abolish \nthe CFPB is within the executive’s constitutional authority.  \nAnd Defendants have not responded to the APA claim with any \nplausible explanation of their conduct as anything other than \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nDefendants’ remaining argument is that the district court’s \ninjunction was too broad.  Vought Br. 53-58.  They made \nmaterially  identical  arguments  in  seeking  a  stay  pending \nappeal, which we largely accommodated in our partial stay of \nthe injunction issued earlier this year.  NTEU v. Vought, No. \n25-5091, 2025 WL 1721068 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 11, 2025).  As \nPlaintiffs note, the only provision of the preliminary injunction \nthat  Defendants  now  seriously  dispute  is  the  temporary \nprohibition on reductions in force—meaning a pause on the \nagency’s ability to finalize permanent, mass firings of all or \nvirtually all of the agency’s staff.  When we sought to tailor our \nstay to afford maximal leeway to Defendants, consistent with \npreliminary  relief  preserving  the  status  quo  pending  final \njudgment, Defendants immediately took steps to fire 90 per \ncent of Bureau staff.  See NTEU Br. 51-52.  At that juncture, \nthe  district  court  was  on  solid  ground  in  concluding  that \n“[a]llowing  [D]efendants  to  execute  their  plans  without \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 106 of 109\n57 \npreliminary relief will cause irreparable harm to the Bureau, \nthe  plaintiffs  in  this  case,  and  plaintiffs’  members  and \nconstituents.”  Vought, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 79.   \nRIFs  are  a  typical,  lawful  personnel-management  tool \nunder normal circumstances.  But it can be appropriate to \nenjoin “otherwise permissible practices connected with the acts \nfound to be illegal” so that “relief is effectual.”  United States \nv. Loew’s, 371 U.S. 38, 53 (1962).  As we noted in reimposing \nthe  relevant  portion  of  the  district  court’s  injunction, \npreventing Defendants from instituting large-scale RIFs that \nwould have the effect of terminating many (if not all) of the \nBureau’s  functions  is  necessary  here  to  “ensure[]  that \n[P]laintiffs  can  receive  meaningful  final  relief  should \n[Defendants] not prevail in this [litigation.]”  NTEU v. Vought, \nNo. 25-5091, 2025 WL 1721136, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, \n2025).   \nIt will be cold comfort to Plaintiffs if they ultimately \nsucceed  on  the  merits  in  their  challenge  to  the  CFPB’s \nshutdown only to discover that Defendants have put the agency \nin a hole from which it can never fully recover.  That would be \nthe effect of the agency’s decisions to fire all or virtually all \nemployees who once worked at the agency, terminate every \ncontract that supported their work, purge all the data they \namassed,  and ghost  all the experts  and organizations with \nwhom  they  had  built  up  beneficial  working  relationships.  \nWithout the district court’s preliminary injunction, the agency \nwould have permanently destroyed the valuable resources on \nwhich the Bureau has long relied to understand and tackle the \nproblems Congress established it to address.  At best, the \ndefunct agency would face a years-long process of rebuilding. \n A  preliminary  injunction  is  necessarily  a  “stopgap \nmeasure” aimed at preserving the status quo, rather than a \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 107 of 109\n58 \ndefinitive resolution of a case or controversy.  Singh, 56 F.4th \nat 95 (citations omitted).  “Crafting a preliminary injunction is \nan exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as \nmuch on the equities of a given case as the substance of the \nlegal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance \nProject, 582 U.S. 571, 579 (2017).  The district court did not \nabuse its discretion or its reasoned judgment in determining \nthat restrictions on RIFs were necessary to ensure that there \nwould still be a Bureau when the time came to rule definitively \non the merits of Plaintiffs’ challenges. \nIt  is  uncontested  that  responsibility  for  the  Bureau’s \noperations lies with the President and his chosen, politically \naccountable leadership rather than with the judiciary.  The \ndistrict  court  has  appropriately  invited  Defendants  to \n“propose[] reasonable and appropriate modifications to the \npreliminary  injunction  that  preserve  [their]  day-to-day \nmanagerial discretion.”  April 3 Order at 1, ECF No. 102.  We \nhave  made  clear  that  concerns  of  overbreadth  “do[]  not \nnecessitate the dissolution of the preliminary injunction,” as \n“[t]he district court retains the power to modify the injunction \nin the exercise of its sound discretion” to accommodate the \nenjoined party.  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Burford, 835 F.2d 305, \n325-26 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Defendants have not taken up the \ndistrict court’s invitation.  Indeed, it is striking that, throughout \nall their objections to the scope of relief in this case, Defendants \nnever offered any “workable path in this emergency posture for \nnarrowing the scope of relief.”  Nebraska v. Biden, 52 F.4th \n1044, 1048 (8th Cir. 2022).  A district court cannot be forced \nto  “fashion  narrower,  ostensibly  permissible  policies  from \nwhole cloth” where Defendants have proposed no such policy \nthemselves.  J.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, 1335 (D.C. Cir. \n2019).  It is up to the government, not the district court, to \n“suggest the contours of any such approach.”  Id.  They have \nnot. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 108 of 109\n59 \nI would therefore reject Defendants’ arguments that the \ndistrict court abused its discretion in acting to preserve the \nstatus  quo  while  litigation  over  their  unlawful  attempt  to \nterminate the agency continues. \nVI. \nThroughout  this  case,  Defendants  have  offered  no \nconvincing  explanation  for  their  activity  on  the  week  of \nFebruary  10.    Before  the  district  court,  Martinez,  with \nimpressive understatement, suggested that Defendants’ actions \ncreated a “very fluid situation” at the Bureau.  Supplemental \nMartinez Decl. ¶ 4 (J.A. 241).  In oral argument to this court, \nDefendants’ counsel described the situation as obscured by “a \nfog of confusion.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 78:13-14.  In this preliminary \nposture, in circumstances in which the speed and scope of the \ngovernment’s action put enormous pressure on the court and \nthe litigants, and without the benefit of discovery, the record is \ndoubtlessly less clear than we might like.   \nBut the evidence that is before us is damning.  Many of \nDefendants’  undisputed  actions  cannot  reasonably  be \nunderstood as advancing any purpose other than the willful \ndestruction of a congressionally created agency, in the face of \nthe  “bedrock  principle[]  of  constitutional  law”  that  the \nexecutive “may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or \nprohibition simply because of policy objections.”  In re Aiken \nCnty, 725 F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.).  Had \nthe district court not acted, there is very little reason to believe \nthat the CFPB would have existed by the end of March. \nThe majority does not deny that Defendants acted as the \ndistrict court found.  Nor do my colleagues dispute that such \nactions were unlawful for all the reasons that Plaintiffs have \nalleged.    Nevertheless,  they  elect  to  shield  Defendants’ \nillegality from any effective judicial oversight.  Defendants \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5091      Document #2130273            Filed: 08/15/2025      Page 109 of 109\n60 \nannounced and celebrated their lawless decision to reporters \nand  the  broader  public.    But  they  did  not  announce  their \ndecision  in  the  pages  of  the  Federal  Register,  and  my \ncolleagues take that lack of formal recordation as grounds to \nvacate the preliminary injunction.  Doing so is an invitation to \nagency evasion and deception.  Our constitutional and statutory \nresponsibility to hold executive agencies to the law requires \nmore.  I respectfully dissent. \n ",

[Dkt. # 98] at 4–5, pending the outcome of the motion \nfor emergency stay pending before the Court of Appeals.  The rest of the motion is DENIED, but \nwithout prejudice to a motion that proposes reasonable and appropriate modifications to the \npreliminary injunction that preserve its day-to-day managerial discretion.  The parties met and \nconferred in the past and agreed to terms that governed the period between the filing of plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and the ruling on the motion for preliminary \ninjunction, and the Court encourages them to do so again.  \n \nThe Court must consider four factors in connection with a motion to stay pending appeal: \n(1) whether the movant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) \nwhether the movant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 102     Filed 04/03/25     Page 2 of 5\nlies.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The Supreme Court has explained that the first \ntwo factors “are the most critical.”  Id.  \n \nDefendants say very little about most of this, and for all of the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum Opinion, [Dkt. #87] (“Mem. Op.”), the defendants cannot make the necessary \nshowing.  First, the Court found that the defendants’ objections to its exercise of jurisdiction are \nunsupported, and after a detailed analysis of the testimony and agency records introduced by both \nsides, it found that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, including  the claim \nthat the defendants are in fact engaged in an effort to shut down the agency in violation of law \nnotwithstanding their denials.  See Mem. Op. at 61–101.  This is not just a typical pause while the \nnew administration considers and readjusts agency priorities.  \n \nSecond, the defendants cannot point to any injury, much less any irreparable injury, that \nwould flow from compliance with an injunction that requires that the agency continue to exist as \nCongress mandated and to perform its statutorily required duties, including in particular, the duties \nassigned to the Office of Consumer Response, while the merits of plaintiffs’ claims are being \nlitigated. \n \nWhat is striking about the defendants’ motion is that they pay very little attention to the \nmerits of the case at all.  They do not seem to dispute that they lack the ability to close the agency \nestablished by Congress on their own.  Instead, the focus of the attack is the claimed breadth of \nthe remedy.  But their description of the Order is at odds with the terms of the Order, and their \ndescription of the ruling that prompted it is inaccurate as well.  \n \nDefendants assert in their motion and in the motion filed with the Circuit that “[t]he order \ndoes not track any specific CFPB duties Congress made obligatory.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 2.  But a key \nprovision in the Order is directly tied to the statute and even cites the relevant provision:  \n“Defendants shall ensure that in accordance with 12 U.S.C. § 5492(b)(3), the CFPB Office of \nConsumer Response continues to maintain a single, toll-free telephone number, a website, and a \ndatabase for the centralized collection of consumer complaints regarding consumer financial \nproducts and services, and that it continues to monitor and respond to those complaints, including \nby providing Elevated Case Management.”  Order at 2–3.  Moreover, the Order calls for the \nreinstallation of the Private Student Loan Ombudsman, a position specifically called for by the \nstatute that has been vacant since February 13.  Order at 2; see Mem. Op. at 18.   \n \nDefendants imply that all the Court needed to do was say:  keep fulfilling your statutory \nduties pending the outcome of this case.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 1–2.  But they seem to forget that when \nthe plaintiffs proposed an order that simply required them not to interfere with the employees’ \nperformance of their statutory duties, the defendants objected to that order on the ground that it \nwas too broad, too vague, and unenforceable.  So the Court had to get specific. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 102     Filed 04/03/25     Page 3 of 5\nDefendants  announce  that  “[t]he  Government  has  repeatedly  explained  that,  absent \ncongressional action, the Bureau will continue to perform mandatory statutory duties,” Defs.’ Mot. \nat 1, and that it was doing so when the Court issued its order.  See id. at 2 (“The Government is \nlikely to succeed in challenging the preliminary injunction[,] because the Bureau will continue to \nperform its statutory duties . . . .”).  See also id. at 3 (“Defendants . . . continue to view this Court’s \nintervention  and  supervision  as  unnecessary  to  preserve  Defendant  CFPB’s  existence  and \ncontinued operation.”).  The defendants’ insistence that they should be free to run the agency and \nimplement the statutory requirements without court interference comes a little too late; the \nevidence the Court of Appeals has not yet seen shows that the defendants made the choice not to \nrun the agency at  all – to close it down and fire all of the employees – and that the Reduction in \nForce (“RIF”) notices are ready to go if the injunction is lifted.  \n \nAs the defendants put it, this Court “believed” that absent preliminary relief, the CFPB \nwould be dismantled completely before the case came to its conclusion, but that “belief . . . is \nincorrect and based on outdated evidence since clarified by the current agency leadership.”  Id. \nat 4, citing Suppl. Decl. of Adam Martinez [Dkt. # 47-1]. \n \nSaying something does not make it so.  Nor does saying it “repeatedly.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 1, \n3, 7, 8. \n \nApparently, the defendants have not read the entire Memorandum Opinion.  It does not \npredicate the need for an injunction or base its ruling on a “belief.”  It does not predicate the need \nfor an injunction on outdated evidence.  It held two full days of evidentiary hearings involving \nthree witnesses, including Mr. Martinez, and it reviewed every single document submitted by \neither side. It found that the cited statements in the declaration the defendants are relying on again \nwere not worthy of belief. \n \nDefendants repeat the theme they tried to advance in opposition to the TRO that “it is not \nuncommon  for  agency  leadership  to  reevaluate  . . . policy  choices  at  the  start  of  a  new \nadministration.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 6.  They accuse the Court of being unable to distinguish between \na “temporary directive asking employees to briefly pause” during a transition and the “wholesale \nelimination of an agency.”  Id.  But as recounted in detail in the Memorandum Opinion, the \ndefendants have consistently attempted to blur the distinction between the initial transition emails \nissued by Acting Director Bessent on February 3 and by Acting Director Vought on February 8, \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 102     Filed 04/03/25     Page 4 of 5\nwhich  the Court did not find to be problematic, and the stop work order issued on February 10, \nwhich is the focus of the Order.1 \n \nDefendants challenge the scope of the Order, asserting that the Court “imposed sweeping \nrestrictions and affirmative requirements affecting administration of all routine Bureau operations, \npersonnel decisions, and contract management.” Defs.’ Mot. at 2; see also Defs.’ Mot. at 4 \n(“[A]gencies that remain fully ‘open’ possess broad discretion to allocate resources and make \npersonnel decisions . . . .”).  The Order in this case does prohibit the agency from sending out the \nnotices that have already been prepared and approved by OPM for all agency employees except \nthe few needed to effectuate the RIF and which would leave no open positions behind.  But that is \nnot a routine operation.  As to routine workplace management, the Order includes explicit language \nauthorizing the agency to take ordinary employment actions with respect to individual employees.  \nAnd the Order fully permits the agency to turn off contracts if it determines they are not needed to \nsupport statutorily mandated functions.  The requirement that they not be terminated entirely, \nthough, is necessary to ensure that it will not take the initiation of a two-year procurement process \nto turn them back on if plaintiffs succeed in establishing that defendants’ effort to eliminate the \nagency was unlawful. \n \nFinally,  the  defendants  take  issue  with  what  they  describe  as  the  Court’s \n“inexplicabl[e]” decision  to  require  the  Bureau  “to  adopt  specific  information-technology \npolicies.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 6.  This is also a blatant mischaracterization of the Order.  The evidence \nshowed that the defendants were engaged in negotiations to cancel the lease for its headquarters. \nThe record reflects that there are government-wide policies against remote work.  The record also \nreflects that shortly before the hearing on this motion, the agency cancelled the contract for the \nonly technology available for remote work at the CFPB.  Therefore, it was necessary, and hardly \ninexplicable, to require that if employees are going to work, they have to be provided with either \noffice space or laptop computers equipped with software that can connect securely with the agency.  \nBut the Court did not dictate the particular technology to be selected; it said it could be the brand \nof virtual desktop that had recently been cancelled “or another similar program.”  Order at 2.  \n \nIn short, the Order is hardly as onerous or unsupported as defendants would have this Court \nand the Court of Appeals believe.  As noted above, though, the Court would be open to further \n \n1   Defendants  state  that  the  Court  “failed  to  meaningfully  grapple”  with  the  fact  that \nemployees “ignored the plain language of the email instructing them to seek approval for urgent \nand critical CFPB obligations.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 7.  But the Court specifically found that it is the \ndefendants who are ignoring the plain text of the February 10 order and that their eleventh-hour \nattempt to recharacterize it as something else on the Sunday afternoon before the hearing was \ndisingenuous and unpersuasive. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 102     Filed 04/03/25     Page 5 of 5\ndiscussion about how it could or should be tailored, but it will not lift the order before those \nquestions are resolved. \n \nThat  is  because,  returning  to  the  Nken  v.  Holder  factors,  staying  the  action  would \nsubstantially injure the plaintiffs.  The defendants would be free to move swiftly to take the steps \nthat would eliminate the agency in thirty days, which the Court has already found they are poised \nto do, and that would cause plaintiffs irreparable harm.  Indeed, during the hearing on the motion \nfor preliminary injunction, defendants’ only witness, the Chief Operating Officer of the CFPB, \ntestified, “I now realize how much damage can be done . . . just within a couple of days.”  Tr. of \nEvidentiary Hr’g (Mar. 10, 2025) [Dkt. #  73] at 74.  Given the devastating consequences that \nwould ensue if a stay were entered and the defendants were relieved of their obligation to comply \nwith the Order, the public interest lies decidedly against a stay. \n \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  April 3, 2025 \n5 \n ",

In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress established the \nConsumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau  and  charged  it  with  supervising  and \nregulating financial institutions across the country as well as assisting consumers \nharmed by those institutions. That mandate to the Executive Branch has led to the \nrecovery of billions of dollars for average Americans and, as Congress required, \nproduced a more “fair, transparent, and competitive” market for financial products \nand services. 12 U.S.C. § 5511. Congress established the CFPB through the exercise \nof its constitutional power to regulate commerce, and Congress has the ability to \neliminate the CFPB through that same power. Congress has not done so.  \n2.   In defiance of Congress’s role in our constitutional system and the \nseparation of powers, President Trump has resolved to “totally eliminate[]” the \nCFPB.  \n3.  To  carry  out  that  plan,  he  fired  the  CFPB’s  director  and  illegally \ninstalled Russell Vought as the acting director on February 7. That same day, Elon \nMusk posted on his social media account “CFPB RIP.”  \n4.  With a series of escalating actions beginning on February 8, Vought took \ndrastic steps to make that promise a reality. First, he instructed CFPB staff and \ncontractors to “immediately” stop all work that involved promulgating rules and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 3 of 32\nguidance,  investigations,  public  communications,  supervision  of  covered  entities \ncontracting, and litigation. He then informed the Federal Reserve that the CFPB \nwould not take any additional funding for its operations in the next quarter. The next \nday, Vought directed staff “not [to] perform any work tasks” at all—including tasks \nmandated by statute. He also directed staff not to come into the office. Just one day \nlater,  February  10,  Vought  announced  that  the  CFPB’s  Washington,  DC \nheadquarters was closed—and has since taken steps to cancel the lease on the \nbuilding.  \n5.  Vought didn’t stop there. The next day, February 11, he cancelled $100 \nmillion of contracts with companies that enabled the CFPB to do all aspects of its \nwork, from processing consumer complaints to litigation to supervision. That same \nday, he took the dramatic step of firing, in indiscriminatory fashion, 70 probationary \nemployees. To add insult to injury, he communicated the news via a mail-merged \nform email that didn’t bother to personally address the fired employees who viewed \nthe email on their phones.  \n6.  On February 12, the Bureau’s statutorily mandated consumer complaint \nwent dark, cutting off one of the Bureau’s most direct links with consumers in dire \nfinancial straits. The Bureau’s Consumer Response function is now functioning at \ndiminished capacity at best, threatening a vital lifeline that collects hundreds of \nthousands of consumer complaints a month.  \n7.  Vought is not expected to stop there. On information and belief, Vought \nintends to return the CFPB’s operating reserves to the Federal Reserve. Given that \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 4 of 32\nhe has already informed the Federal Reserve that the CFPB will not take any \nadditional funding, that would eliminate its entire budget. And Vought has planned \nanother mass layoff that may occur imminently—as early as today or tomorrow. \n8.  American consumers are already suffering the consequences. Plaintiff \nPastor Eva Steege—an 83 year old Lutheran pastor whose doctors have told her she \nhas less than six months to live—can no longer discharge her student loan debt before \nshe  dies  because  the  CFPB  cancelled  its  meeting  with  her  and  the  Bureau’s \nstatutorily mandated Student Loan Ombudsman’s office has been forced to shut its \ndoors. Meanwhile, military servicemembers and their families who are owed refund \npayments based on a consent order between a predatory car title lender and the CFPB \nare not getting those refunds because the payments must first be approved by CFPB \nemployees—who, of course, cannot work.  \n9.  Neither the President nor the head of the CFPB has the power to \ndismantle  an  agency  that  Congress  established.  By  suspending  the  statutorily \nmandated activities of the CFPB, Trump and Vought’s shutdown of the CFPB runs \nafoul  of  core  constitutional  separation  of  powers  principles,  Congress’s  express \nstatutory directive, and the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n10.  Trump and Vought’s actions to disable the CFPB have already caused \nmass confusion and imposed significant and irreparable harm on consumers across \nthe country. Absent immediate relief, the defendants will continue to upend the lives \nof countless civil servants. Consumers who were relying on the CFPB to help resolve \nurgent financial disputes—disputes that, absent the CFPB’s intervention, can lead to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 5 of 32\nforeclosure or the inability to get a loan or rent an apartment—have been abandoned. \nEven litigation that was already pending against financial institutions that scammed \nconsumers and exploited ordinary Americans has come to a halt, and the agency is \nnot conducting any new enforcement actions. All supervision of financial institutions \nhas been cancelled. With each day that the agency remains shut down, the financial \ninstitutions that seek to prey on consumers are emboldened—harming their law-\nabiding competitors and the consumers who fall victim to them.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \nbecause this action arises under the laws of the United States, namely, the United \nStates Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, \n706. \n12.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(A) \nbecause the defendants are officers and agencies of the United States.  \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff  National  Treasury  Employees  Union  is  the  exclusive \nbargaining representative of employees at 37 federal departments and agencies, more \nthan 1,000 of whom work at the CFPB. About sixty probationary employees who were \nfired were represented by NTEU.  \n14.   Plaintiff National Consumer Law Center uses the tools of advocacy, \neducation,  and  litigation  to  fight  for  economic  justice  for  low-income  and  other \nvulnerable people who have been abused, deceived, discriminated against, or left \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 6 of 32\nbehind in our economy. NCLC interacts with and relies on the CFPB in many ways: \nthe Bureau purchases NCLC’s publications and hires NCLC to conduct trainings for \nCFPB employees; NCLC’s treatises and reports rely heavily, and link to, the CFPB’s \nreports and data; and NCLC uses the CFPB’s complaint database to draft reports. \n15.  Plaintiff National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is \nthe oldest and largest civil rights organization in the United States. Its mission is to \nachieve equality, political rights, and social inclusion by advancing policies and \npractices  that  expand  human  and  civil  rights,  eliminate  discrimination,  and \naccelerate the well-being, education, and economic security of Black people and all \npersons  of  color.  The  NAACP  was  actively  working  with  the  CFPB  to  address \npredatory practices targeted at its members in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires. \n16.  Plaintiff  Virginia  Poverty  Law  Center  is  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit \norganization that since 1978 has worked to break down systemic barriers that keep \nlow-income Virginians in the cycle of poverty through advocacy, education, litigation, \nand  direct  counseling  and  referral  services.  It  routinely  relies  on  the  CFPB’s \nconsumer response function, consumer complaint database, and CFPB research and \npublications to serve its client base.    \n17.  Plaintiff  Rev.  Eva  Steege  is  an  83-year-old  retired  pastor  of  the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America. Pastor Steege took on student loans to \npursue higher education at a seminary, to fulfill her calling as a pastor. Because of \nher advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Pastor Steege has been told that \nshe has no longer than six months to live. She is entitled to discharge her loans under \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 7 of 32\nthe Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and the CFPB was helping her do so. \nPastor Seege wants to ensure that she discharges her debt before she dies, so that \nshe will not burden her surviving family, and because she could pass on to her family \nas much as $15,000 of overpayments. Pastor Steege had a meeting scheduled with \nthe Bureau this week that was suddenly cancelled because of the CFPB’s unlawful \nclosure. Absent the CFPB’s assistance, it is unlikely that she will be able to discharge \nher debt and get her overpayments returned before she passes away.  \n18.  Plaintiff CFPB Employee Association is a membership organization of \ndedicated public servants committed to advocating for the interests of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. Its members include current and former employees of \nthe CFPB, including probationary employees who were recently terminated.  \n19.  Defendant  Russell  Vought  is  the  Acting  Director  of  the  Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. He is sued in his official capacity. \n20.  Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an agency of the \nUnited States. \nBACKGROUND \nStatutory Creation of the CFPB \n \n21.  In July 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1376 \n(2010),  “[t]o  promote  the  financial  stability  of  the  United  States  by  improving \naccountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail’, to \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 8 of 32\nprotect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, [and] to protect consumers from \nabusive financial services practices.”  Id.  \n22.  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, titled the Consumer Financial Protection \nAct of 2010 (CFP Act), established the CFPB as an “independent bureau” within the \nFederal  Reserve  System.  12  U.S.C.  § 5491(a).  Congress  tasked  the  CFPB  with \n“implement[ing]” and “enforc[ing]” a large body of financial consumer protection laws \nto  “ensur[e]  that  all  consumers  have  access  to  markets  for  consumer  financial \nproducts and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services \nare fair, transparent, and competitive.” Id. § 5511(a). Congress required the CFPB’s \n“principal office” to be located in Washington, D.C. Id. § 5491(a).  \n23.  The CFPB is headed by a single Director, who is appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. 12 U.S.C. § 5491(b)(1)–(2). \nCongress required that the Bureau’s Deputy Director, who is “appointed by the \nDirector,” shall “serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the \nDirector.” Id. § 5491(b)(5).  \n24.  The CFP Act charges the CFPB with numerous mandatory duties to \nprotect consumers and taxpayers. including duties related to the supervision of \nfinancial institutions, research and education, enforcement, and rulemaking. See \ngenerally  P.L.  111-203,  Title  X,  §§  1001–1100H.  Among  other  things,  Congress \nrequired the CFPB to perform the following activities: \na.  Obligations  to  Monitor  and  Respond  to  Consumer \nComplaints. The CFP Act requires the CFPB to “collect[],” “monitor[],” and \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 9 of 32\n“respon[d] to consumer complaints regarding consumer financial products or \nservices.” Id. § 5493(b)(3)(A). The CFPB is further required to “establish … \nreasonable  procedures  to  provide  a  timely  response  to  consumers”  for \ncomplaints  or  inquiries.  Id.  §  5534.  Those  complaints  can  and  do  “help \nconsumers get resolution to the problems they encounter.”1  \nb.  Research, Reporting, and Information Obligations. The Act \nimposes  on  the  CFPB  numerous  research,  reporting,  and  information \nobligations. For example, the CFPB is required to “research[], analyz[e], and \nreport[]” on market developments for consumer financial products or services \nand  consumer  understanding  of  and  access  to  financial  products.  Id. \n§ 5493(b)(1). In addition, it is required to publish and disseminate information \nabout  credit  rates  and  credit  cards.  See  15  U.S.C.  §§  1646(a),  (b);  id.  § \n1632(d)(3). And the CFPB must “provide staff and data processing resources” \nto the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, 12 U.S.C. § 2809(c), \nand to compile information on depository institutions and aggregate lending \npatterns, id. § 2809(a).  \nc.  Obligations  to  establish  specific  offices.  Congress  further \nrequired the CFPB to establish offices that perform specified tasks or aid \nspecific groups of consumers. For example, the CFP Act requires that a Private \nEducation  Loan  Ombudsman  “provide  timely  assistance  to  borrowers  of \n \n1 CFPB, Four million complaints: More than just a milestone (Sep. 29, 2023), \nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/four-million-complaints-more-than-\njust-a-milestone/. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 10 of 32\nprivate education loans.” Id. § 5535(a). Among other things, the Ombudsman \nis required to “compile and analyze data on borrower complaints regarding \nprivate education loans” and, in accordance with regulations, “receive, review, \nand attempt to resolve informally complaints” from loan borrowers. Id. §§ \n(c)(1)(3). \nIn addition, the statute requires the CFPB to establish an Office of \nFinancial Protection for Older Americans that “shall … monitor certifications \nor  designations  of  financial  advisors  who  advise  seniors  and  alert  the \nCommission and State regulators of certifications or designations that are \nidentified as unfair, deceptive, or abusive” and “conduct research … to educate \nand counsel seniors about personal finance management.” Id. §§ (g)(3)(B), (D).  \nThe  Act  also  requires  the  establishment  of  several  other  offices, \nincluding the Office of Service Members Affairs, which “shall be responsible for \ndeveloping  and  implementing  initiatives  for  service  members  and  their \nfamilies,” id. § (e)(1); the Office of Financial Education, which is mandated to \n“implement a strategy to improve the financial literacy of consumers” through \nvarious “activities including providing opportunities for consumers to access” \nservices,  information,  and  assistance,”  id.  §  (d)(2);  and  the  Office  of  Fair \nLending and Equal Opportunity, which provides oversight and enforcement of \nvarious federal laws and “work[s] with private industry, fair lending, civil \nrights, consumer and community advocates on the promotion of fair lending \ncompliance and education,” id. § 5493(c).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 11 of 32\nd.  Supervision.  The  Dodd-Frank  Act  gives  the  CFPB  broad \nsupervisory authority to examine financial institutions for compliance with \nfederal consumer financial laws. 12 U.S.C. §§ 5514, 5515. For example, the \nCFPB “shall require reports and conduct examinations on a periodic basis” of \npayday lenders and private education lenders.  Id. § 5514(b)(1). In addition, for \ninsured depository institutions and credit unions with more than $10 billion in \nassets, the CFPB “shall have exclusive authority to require reports and conduct \nexaminations on a periodic basis” to “assess[] compliance” with federal law, \n“obtain information” about the activities, systems and procedures of the entity, \nand “detect[] and assess[] risks to consumers and to markets for consumer \nfinancial products and services.” 12 U.S.C. § 5515(b)(1).   \n25.  The Act also confers rulemaking authority on the CFPB. See 12 U.S.C. \n§ 5512(b). The CFPB has the authority to prescribe rules identifying acts or practices \nthat are “unfair, deceptive, or abusive,” id. § 5531(b), and rules imposing disclosure \nrequirements to help consumers understand the terms, benefits, costs, and risks of \nfinancial products and services, id. § 5532; see also id. § 5533. The CFPB also has \nrulemaking  authority  pursuant  to  19  federal  statutes  that  govern  numerous \nconsumer  activities  and  services,  including  debt  collection  practices,  debit  card \ntransfers, overdraft services, consumer leases, mortgage lending, credit card lending, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 12 of 32\nmortgage appraisals, real estate settlement practices, and credit reporting. See 12 \nU.S.C. §§ 5581(a)(1)(A), (b).2  \n26.  Since  its  inception  in  2010,  the  CFPB  has  fulfilled  its  statutorily \nmandated duties by creating the requisite administrative apparatuses and enacting \ndozens of rules and regulations. The agency has published hundreds of fact sheets, \nstudies,  and  technical  assistance  documents  that  are  used  by  financial  services \nproviders,  consumers,  advocates,  and  researchers.  And  the  agency  has  helped \nmillions of consumers obtain relief, both through formal enforcement actions, and \nthrough informal dispute resolution mechanisms required by Congress.  \n27.  On average, the Bureau’s statutorily-mandated complaint resolution \nsystem receives approximately 350,000 complaints per month. In January 2025, the \nnumber was closer to 500,000.

CFPB \nemployees  also  monitor  the  complaints  to  ensure  that  companies  respond  to \nconsumers in a timely fashion and refer some complaints to the Bureau’s enforcement \ndivision. And some complaints—including ones related to imminent actions like \nforeclosures—are investigated by the Bureau’s Escalated Case Management Team. \nMore than 1,000 of these complaints filed each year require attention from the \nEscalated Management. \n28.  Regardless  of  whether  a  complaint  is  sent  to  the  Escalated  Case \nManagement Team, they are very often urgent. The majority relate to consumer \ncredit reports, and most people do not become aware of an error on their reports until \nthey are trying to secure a loan. Consumers also file complaints when they have been \n“debanked”—denied access to their accounts because of their past financial history—\nand face banks who are unwilling to help them restore their accounts. The CFPB is \noften  the  only  resource  available  to  help  them  regain  access.  Consumers  also \ncomplain  regularly  about  surprise  fees  and  interest  attached  to  payday  loans. \nConsumers who need payday loans typically have little-to-no expendable income, and \nthese surprise costs can mean missing the bus to work and therefore losing your job, \nskipping or rationing medications, or losing child-care. \n29.  The Dodd-Frank Act specifies that funding of the CFPB come from “the \ncombined earnings of the Federal Reserve System.” See 12 U.S.C. § 5497. \n30.  The Act directs that, each quarter, the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve will transfer “the amount determined by the Director [of the Bureau] to be \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 14 of 32\nreasonably  necessary  to  carry  out  the  authorities  of  the  Bureau,”  subject  to  a \nstatutory cap of 12% of the total operating expenses of the Federal Reserve (inflation \nadjusted). Id. § 5497(a)(1); see id. § 5497(a)(2)(A)–(B). In addition, the CFPB Director \nmay request additional funds from Congress if necessary to carry out the authorities \nof the Bureau. See id. § 5497(e). \n31.  For Fiscal Year 2025, “[t]he CFPB’s projected budget estimate for its \noperations … [was] $810.6 million.”3  \n32.  By letter to the Federal Reserve on October 8, 2024, then-CFPB Director \nRohit Chopra requested a monetary transfer in the amount of $248,900,000, stating \nthat he had “determined [it] is the amount necessary to carry out the authorities of \nthe Bureau for FY2025 Q1.”4 Three days later, the Federal Reserve confirmed by \nletter that the requested funds had been transferred to the CFPB.5  \n33.

On February 1, 2025, President Trump fired then-Director of the CFPB \nRohit Chopra as Director of the CFPB. Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the CFPB’s then-\nDeputy Director, Zixta Martinez, then became Acting Director of the CFPB. See 12 \nU.S.C. § 5491(b)(5). \n35.  Two days later, President Trump appointed Treasury Secretary Bessent \nas the Acting Director of the CFPB.  \n36.  On February 3, 2025, then-Acting Director Bessent sent an email, titled \n“Instructions  from  Acting  Director,”  directing  all  CFPB  staff  and  contractors  to \n“immediately” suspend activities in six areas of work. Specifically, the February 3 \nemail stated that unless expressly approved by Bessent, all CFPB workers were \nrequired:  \n•  “[n]ot to approve or issue any proposed or final rules or formal or \ninformal guidance”;  \n•  “[t]o suspend the effective dates of all final rules that have been \nissued or published but that have not yet become effective”;  \n•  “[n]ot  to  commence,  take  additional  investigative  activities \nrelated to, or settle enforcement actions”;  \n \n6 https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb-12-19-letter-from-cfpb-to-\nfrb_2025-01.pdf. \n7  https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_01-02-letter-from-frb-to-\ncfpb_2025-01.pdf. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 16 of 32\n•  “[n]ot  to  issue  public  communications  of  any  type,  including \npublication of research papers”; \n•  “[n]ot to approve or execute any material agreements, including \nrelated to employee matters or contractors”; and  \n•  “[n]ot to make or approve filings or appearances by the Bureau in \nany litigation, other than to seek a pause in proceedings.” \nId. The February 3 email stated that Acting Director Bessent was issuing these \ndirectives “to promote consistency with the goals of the Administration.” Id.  \n37.  By email to all CFPB staff and contractors on February 4, 2025, Acting \nDirector Bessent “[u]pdate[d]” his February 3 directive halting another category of \nwork.

On Friday, February 7, 2025, President Trump named Russell Vought, \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as Acting Director of the CFPB.  \n39.  That  same  day,  Elon  Musk  and  other  members  of  the  so-called \n“Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) accessed CFPB’s headquarters and \ncomputer systems.8 Several hours later, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a tombstone \nemoji on his social-media site X.9  \n \n8  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/elon-musk-team-cfpb-00203119; \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/10/trump-vs-cfpb-russ-vought-\norders-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-to-stop-work/. \n9 https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1887979940269666769. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 17 of 32\n40.

On  February  8,  2025,  Acting  Director  Vought  sent  an  email  titled \n“Directives on Bureau Activities.” The email stated that Vought was “committed to \nimplementing the President’s policies” and that “[t]o that end,” he directed all CFPB \nstaff and contractors to comply “immediately” with nine directives to cease work, \nunless expressly approved by Vought:  \n•  “[n]ot approve or issue any proposed or final rules or formal or \ninformal guidance”; \n•  “[s]uspend the effective dates of all final rules that have been \nissued or published but that have not yet become effective”; \n•  “[n]ot commence, take additional investigative activities related \nto, or settle enforcement actions”; \n•  “[n]ot open any new investigation in any manner, and cease any \npending investigations”; \n•  “[n]ot  issue  public  communications  of  any  type,  including \npublication of research papers and compliance bulletins”; \n•  “[n]ot approve or execute any material agreements, including \nrelated to employee matters or contractors”; \n•  “[n]ot make or approve filings or appearances by the Bureau in \nany litigation, other than to seek a pause in proceedings”; \n•  “[c]ease all supervision and examination activity”; \n \n10  https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/08/cfpbs-x-account-goes-\ndark-as-russell-vought-takes-over-elon-musk-posts-cfpb-rip/. \n11  https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2025/02/09/consumer-financial-\nprotection-bureau-adds-error-message-to-home-page/. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 18 of 32\n•  “[c]ease all stakeholder engagement.”  \n42.  Approximately one hour later, Acting Director Vought stated in a social \nmedia post on X that he “ha[d] notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB will not be \ntaking  its  next  draw  of  unappropriated  funding  because  it  is  not  ‘reasonably \nnecessary’ to carry out its duties.” 12  \n43.  In the absence of taking a draw from the Federal Reserve, the Bureau \nmust rely on its reserve fund.   \n44.  On information and belief, Defendant Vought intends to imminently \nreturn the funds in the CFPB’s reserves to the Federal Reserve. Although Vought has \nstated that in his view, that money is not “necessary to fulfill the Bureau’s mandate,” \nwithout that money, the Bureau will be unable to fund its operations. \n45.  On the evening of February 9, 2025, CFPB Chief Operating Officer \nAdam Martinez sent an email to all CFPB staff stating that the CFPB’s headquarters \nwould close the next day and instructing “[e]mployees and contractors … to work \nremotely unless instructed otherwise from our Acting Director or his designee.”13 No \nreason was given for the closure.  \n46.  On the morning of Monday, February 10, 2025, Vought sent an email \nwith the subject line “Additional Directives on Bureau Activities,” reiterating that \nthe CFPB’s “DC headquarters building is closed this week.” The February 10 email \n \n12 https://x.com/russvought/status/1888423503537360986 \n13  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/russell-vought-consumer-bureau-\nprotect-hq-close.html;  see  https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cfpbs-headquarters-be-\nclosed-coming-week-email-says-2025-02-09/. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 19 of 32\ndirected all CFPB staff “not [to] perform any work tasks” at all and that “employees \nshould stand down from performing any work task.” The email stated that “[i]f there \nare any urgent matters,” CFPB staff should “alert [Vought] through Mark Paoletta,” \nwho is the Office of Management and Budget General Counsel and who was identified \nin the email as the CFPB’s Chief Legal Officer, “to get approval in writing before \nperforming any work task.”   \n47.  Later that day, reporters speaking with President Trump asked him to \nconfirm that “his goal was to have [the CFPB] totally eliminated.” President Trump \nstated, “I would say, yeah, because we’re trying to get rid of waste, fraud, and \nabuse.”14 President Trump further stated, “[W]e did the right thing. [The CFPB] was \na very important thing to get rid of, and it was also a waste. I mean, number one, it \nwas a bad group of people running it, but it was also a waste.”15 President Trump \nreportedly “praised his administration for shutting the CFPB and used the past tense \nto describe the [CFPB].”16  \n \n14 https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/1889132023933022283?mx=2. \n15  https://www.facebook.com/ANINEWS.IN/videos/shes-a-nasty-woman-\ntrump-slams-senator-elizabeth-warren-after-her-cfpb-neutraliz/1227075188971091/;  \nsee also Alejandra Jaramillo, Trump confirms goal to “totally eliminate” the Consumer \nFinancial  Protection  bureau,  CNN  Politics  (Feb.  10,  2025), \nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-doge-presidency-news-02-10-\n25/index.html (quoting President Trump).  \n16  https://www.americanbanker.com/news/president-trump-confirms-his-goal-\nis-to-eliminate-the-cfpb \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 20 of 32\nDefendants’ Additional Actions to Shut Down the CFPB \n48.  By email on the evening of February 11, 2025, approximately 70 CFPB \nemployees who were newly hired and subject to a two-year probationary period were \nterminated.17 The email stated, “Unfortunately, the Agency finds that that [sic] you \nare not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do \nnot fit the Agency’s current needs.”18 \n49.  In the past few days, the CFPB has cancelled more than 150 vendor \ncontracts. The canceled contracts reportedly include “102 vendor contracts for the \nCFPB’s enforcement division, 33 contracts linked to the director’s office, and 16 \ncontracts for the agency’s supervision unit.”19 The Bureau also cancelled nearly all \ncontracts that underlie the consumer complaint function. \n50.  The  defendants  have  reportedly  informed  the  General  Services \nAdministration that they are terminating the lease of the CFPB’s headquarters office \nin Washington, D.C. \n51.  The defendants are also preparing to conduct another mass firing, this \ntime of over 95% of the Bureau’s employees. That would make it impossible for the \nBureau to fulfill any of its statutorily required functions.   \n \n17  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/cfpb-fires-70-enforcement-\nlawyers-other-probationary-employees \n18  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/cfpb-fires-70-enforcement-\nlawyers-other-probationary-employees. \n19  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/cfpb-cancels-more-than-100-\nmillion-in-contracts-amid-doge-probe. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 21 of 32\nConsequences of Defendants’ Stop-Work Orders \n52.  By freezing the CFPB’s work, the defendants have put an immediate \nhalt to the CFPB’s performance of its statutorily mandated functions. \n53.  The defendants’ orders to halt work at the CFPB have had devastating \nconsequences.  Among  countless  other  consequences,  halting  CFPB  work  has \nsuspended oversight of the biggest banks to ensure that they comply with the law; \npending  rulemakings,  including  a  rulemaking to  stop  data  brokers  from  selling \nsensitive personal data to scammers, stalkers, and spies;20 and enforcement actions \nagainst institutions violating consumer financial protection laws.21  \n54.  Shuttering the agency has also severely disrupted the CFPB’s consumer \ncomplaint operation: The hotline consumers call to submit complaints went offline, \ndespite  Congress’s  clear  command  that  the  CFPB  “establish[]  a  single,  toll-free \ntelephone  number”  for  use  in  collecting  complaints.  12 U.S.C.  § 5493(b)(3)(A). \nAlthough the Bureau may now have reinstated the contractors who operate the \nhotline, the operation remains severely diminished. The CFPB cancelled the contract \nfor the contractors that processed mailed-in complaints and complaints referred to \nthe CFPB by other federal agencies and Congress. Complaints submitted online can’t \n \n20  https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-\nto-stop-data-brokers-from-selling-sensitive-personal-data-to-scammers-stalkers-\nand-spies/ \n21 See Press Release, National Consumer Law Center, Unlawful Shut Down of \nConsumer Agency Endangers Working Families, Honest Businesses, and the Economy \n(Feb.  10,  2025),  https://www.nclc.org/unlawful-shut-down-of-consumer-agency-\nendangers-working-families-honest-businesses-the-economy/  (identifying  various \nimpacted enforcement actions).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 22 of 32\nbe sent to companies unless those companies are already in the CFPB’s system. \nParticularly  devastating  is  that  the  Escalated  Case  Management  Team—which \nresponds to extremely time sensitive complaints, like those involving foreclosures—\nis not working. And consumers who filed complaints related to other time-sensitive \nmatters—like correcting a credit report so that they can obtain a loan, or regaining \naccess to a bank account after being frozen out—can’t rely on the CFPB to ensure \nthey receive timely responses to their complaints, either.  \n55.  The  shutdown  has  had  a  similar  effect  on  the  Student  Loan \nOmbudsman’s Office. The Office receives thousands of complaints a year, and its staff \nresolve  hundreds  of  complaints  each  month.  2024  Annual  Report  of  the  CFPB \nStudent Loan Ombudsman at 9.22 \n56.  The  complaints  concern  inaccurate  billing  statements,  yearslong \nprocessing delays, inability to reach lenders to lodge complaints directly, and missing \nrefunds of hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. \n57.  The complaints are submitted through a telephone hotline, an electronic \nsubmission  process  and  referrals  from  congressmembers  and  direct  service \norganizations.  Complaints are screened by contractors and Bureau staff before being \nrouted to lenders, who are required to respond within 15 days. \n \n22  https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_2024-annual-student-\nloan-ombudsmans-report_2024-11.pdf. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 23 of 32\n58.  Because of the stop-work order, complaints are not being addressed by  \nstaff and not being routed to lenders, who sometimes resolve issues without the need \nfor intervention from the CFPB. \n59.  The Ombudsman’s work has had profound impact on the borrowers it \nserved. For instance, CFPB staff has successfully resolved complaints that involve \nschools  withholding  college  transcripts  and  thereby  preventing  borrowers  from \npursuing employment. One borrower described the hold on her transcript as like a \n“hold on [her] life.” \n60.   Another  borrower,  had  nearly  $5,000  erroneously  drawn  from  her \naccount for a loan payment. She was given conflicting information and then told a \nrefund could take 12 weeks. After lodging a complaint with the Ombudsman, she \nreceived a refund. \n61.  Another borrower had loans cancelled and was due a $20,000 refund.  \nAfter contacting the lender directly and waiting nearly two years, the borrower lodged \na complaint with the CFPB. The lender issued a refund shortly after.  \n62.  Stories like this abound, and borrowers just like this will be left to the \nlong delays, conflicting information, and denials of refunds that the Ombudsman’s \noffice, when functioning, has helped others avoid.   \n63.  These  immediate  consequences  have  already  harmed  each  of  the \nplaintiffs. \n64.  The National Treasury Employees Union’s more than 775 members at \nthe CFPB face severe uncertainty and stress about their job security. Seventy CFPB \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 24 of 32\nemployees, many of whom were NTEU members, have already been fired. Those who \nhave not yet been fired understandably fear for their jobs. Indeed, they have good \nreason to believe a mass layoff is imminent. And given the instructions to stop work, \nthey lack clarity about their job status and their ability to comply with their usual \nwork obligations. \n65.   The National Consumer Law Center has already had multiple of its \ncontracts with the CFPB cancelled. Those cancellations will cost NCLC thousands of \ndollars. The CFPB’s subscription to NCLC’s publication, for example, funds much of \nthe  organization’s  publishing  work.  CFPB  employees  have  also  withdrawn  as \npanelists from trainings organized by NCLC. And NCLC relies extensively on data \nand reports published by the CFPB. Stopping the CFPB’s work will deprive NCLC of \nthis important information going forward.  \n66.  Pastor Steege has, over the years, had great difficulty in attempting to \nenroll in Public Service Loan Forgiveness. In late 2024, however, the pastor sought \nhelp from the CFPB. After an initial meeting with the Bureau in January 2025, \nPastor Steege was hopeful that she might finally enroll in the program, have her \nloans forgiven, and, in fact, be returned $15,000 in overpayments. She scheduled a \nfollow-up meeting with the Bureau for February 10, 2025. But the night before the \nmeeting Pastor Steege learned that President Trump had taken steps to shut down \nthe CFPB. Then, on the morning of the scheduled meeting, CFPB staff emailed Pastor \nSteege  and  informed  her  that,  “due  to  new  guidance  CFPB  employees  recently \nreceived,” the meeting was cancelled. No new meeting was scheduled, and Pastor \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 25 of 32\nSteege  has  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  CFPB—with  its  worked  indefinitely \nstopped—will ever be able to help her. \n67.  The inability to seek loan forgiveness and a refund of $15,000 would be \na devastating consequence standing alone. But it is even more dire for Pastor Steege. \nBecause of her advanced cancer diagnosis, Pastor Steege has been told she has no \nmore than six months to live. She hoped to have her loans forgiven so that she would \nnot burden her surviving family with her debt, and so that they could use the $15,000 \nrefund for basic needs after she passes. If the CFPB isn’t able to help her, Pastor \nSteege will spend her final six months in great duress, worried that she is leaving her \nfamily with a financial burden and without the monetary help to which they are \nentitled. And if the loan is not forgiven while she is alive her family will be forced to \npursue a death discharge that will not provide them with the $15,000 refund. \n68.  The NAACP was actively working with the CFPB to protect NAACP \nmembers who live in Altadena, California. Those members have been targeted by \npredatory financial practices in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires. The complete \nfreeze on the CFPB’s work has halted that collaboration and harmed both the NAACP \nmembers and the NAACP itself, which now must assist its members without the \nCFPB’s assistance. \n69.  The Virginia Poverty Law Center operates a Predatory Loan Helpline \nthat consumers can call when they need help with unfair and predatory loans.  The \nphone  number  is  featured  prominently  on  the  Center’s  website.  Because  of  the \nCenter’s limited staffing, even the CEO helps to answer the hotline.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 26 of 32\n70.  The Center routinely directs consumers who call the hotline to use the \nCFPB’s consumer response complaint function. It even notes this resource on the \nCenter’s website. \n71.  This process takes Center staff approximately 10 minutes and gets \ntimely  and  helpful  results.  In  September,  for  example,  the  Center  received  a \ncomplaint about an out-of-state lender that had been claiming that it was not subject \nto Virginia law. The Center helped the consumer submit a complaint to the CFPB, \nand it quickly resulted in a reduction of the interest rate on the loan from 118% to \n36%, with a 50% reduction in payments.  This is just one example of success the \nCenter’s client base has seen from referrals. There are many others. \n72.  Before the CFPB’s existence, the Center used to handle these complaints \nentirely itself.  It consumed far more resources to replicate what the CFPB now does \nin minutes. Because the Center’s staff is so limited, if it had to return to handling \ncomplaints itself, it would be unable to commit resources to other work.  \n73.  The Center also uses the CFPB’s consumer response database to inform \nits work.  If that database were not updated, or trustworthy, the Center would lose \nan important tool that it relies on to set its organizational priorities on what to \nadvocate about and how to educate consumers.  \n74.  Plaintiff CFPB Employee Association’s members include probationary \nemployees who have already been fired, as well as current employees who rightly fear \nfor their jobs.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 27 of 32\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount One  \n(Non-statutory review of official and agency action) \n \n75.  Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoing and declare \nunlawful official action that is ultra vires. \n76.  The Constitution vests executive power in the President. U.S. Const., \nart. II, and imposes on the President a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n77.  The President of the United States has only those powers conferred on \nhim by the Constitution and federal statutes. \n78.  Federal legislation must be passed by both chambers of Congress before \nit may be presented to the President, and, if signed, become law. U.S. Const., art. I. \nThe President and Executive Branch have no authority under the Constitution to \namend statutes unilaterally. \n79.  The CFPB was established as a federal agency by Congress by statute, \nthe Dodd Frank Act, signed into law in 2010, and can be eliminated only by Congress. \n80.  Defendants’ actions to eliminate the CFPB exceed executive authority, \nusurp legislative authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution, defendant \nVought was not lawfully appointed, and his actions are ultra vires and should be \nenjoined. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 28 of 32\nCount Two  \n(Non-statutory review of official and agency action) \n \n81.   The Constitution mandates that the President obtain “the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate” before appointing “Officers of the United States.” U.S. Const. \nart. II, § 2, cl. 2. \n82.  The Director of the CFPB is an Officer of the United States. \n83.  President  Trump  appointed  Defendant  Vought  as  acting  Director \nwithout  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate.    Defendant  Vought  was  neither \nnominated nor confirmed by the Senate to that position. \n84.  President Trump purported to appoint Defendant Vought under the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act, which allow for temporary appointments without the \nadvice and consent of the Senate when the prior holder of a Senate-confirmed office \n“dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.” \n5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). \n85.  But President Trump fired the last Senate-confirmed Director, Rohit \nChopra. Chopra did not die, he did not resign, and he was not unable to perform the \nfunctions and duties of the office. He continued to perform them until the day he was \nfired, over a week into President Trump’s term.  \n86.  The President’s appointment of Defendant Vought as Acting Director of \nthe CFPB is therefore unconstitutional and Defendant Vought has no power to direct \nthe agency. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 29 of 32\n87.  Congress has provided that, when the Bureau is missing a director, the \ndeputy director shall lead the agency. See 5 U.S.C. § 5491(b)(5). The deputy director, \nnot Defendant Vought, therefore has the authority to exercise the Bureau’s powers. \n88.  In addition, Congress has charged the Secretary of Education, not the \nDirector,  with  responsibility  for  designating  the  Private  Education  Loan \nOmbudsman. 12 U.S.C. § 5535(a). The authority to control who holds that office rests \nwith the Secretary. By functionally removing the ombudsman from the office by \nprohibiting her from doing any work, Defendant Vought has exercised power of the \nSecretary without being confirmed by the Senate to do so. \n89.  Because defendant Vought was not lawfully appointed, his actions are \nultra vires and should be enjoined. \nCount Three \n(Administrative Procedure Act—706(2)(C)      \n \n90.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n… in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n91.  Defendants’  actions  and  intended  further  actions  to  suspend  or \nterminate CFPB’s statutorily mandated activities—including by issuing stop-work \ninstructions, cancelling contracts, declining and returning funding, firing employees, \nand terminating the lease for its headquarters—constitute final agency action under \nthe APA.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 30 of 32\n92.  No defendant possesses the statutory authority to require CFPB to cease \nwork on the activities it is statutorily required to perform. Defendants’ actions exceed \ntheir statutory authority.  \nCount Four \n(Administrative Procedure Act—706(2)(A) \n \n93.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final \nagency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n94.  Defendants’ actions and intended further action to suspend or terminate \nCFPB’s statutorily mandated activities and to return the funding that the CFPB \nneeds to sustain its operations constitute final agency actions under the APA.  \n95.  Defendants’ actions were taken without notice, reasoned explanation, or \nreasonable recourse.  \n96.  Defendants’ actions were arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, and \nnot in accordance with law.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n(A)  Declare that the defendants’ actions to dismantle the CFPB and their \nsuspension of CFPB’s statutorily mandated activities are unlawful;  \n(B)  Declare unlawful and set aside the defendants’ actions and intended \nfurther actions to dismantle the CFPB, including issuance of stop-work instructions, \ncancellation of contracts, declining and returning funding, reductions in force, firing \nof  employees,  and  termination  of  the  lease  for  its  headquarters,  as  arbitrary, \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 7     Filed 02/13/25     Page 31 of 32\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A), contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B), and in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); \n(C)  Issue  an  injunction  barring  Defendants  Vought  and  CFPB  from \nimplementing  or  complying  with  the  directions  to  cease  work  absent  the \nauthorization of Congress; \n(D)  Order  Defendants  Vought  and  CFPB  to  resume  immediately  all \nactivities that CFPB is required by statute to perform;   \n(E)  Issue  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary  injunction \ndirecting Defendants Vought and CFPB to cease immediately actions to cease CFPB’s \noperations;  \n(F)  Award  Plaintiffs  their  costs,  reasonable  attorney’s  fees,  and  other \ndisbursements as appropriate; and \n(G) Grant such other relief as the Court deems necessary, just, and proper. \n \nDated: February 13, 2025   Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n/s/ Deepak Gupta   /s/ Wendy Liu                            \nDeepak Gupta (DC Bar No. 495451)  Wendy Liu (DC Bar No. 1600942) \nRobert Friedman (D.C.

See Order [Dkt. \n# 19].  Upon consideration of the motion, defendants’ opposition [Dkt. #31], plaintiffs’ reply \n[Dkt. #  40],  the  parties’  supplemental  submissions,  the  arguments  advanced  and  evidence \nintroduced during the hearings conducted on March 3, 10, and 11, 2025, and the full record in this \ncase, and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion [Dkt. # 87], it is \nhereby ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED.  In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 65(a) \nand (d)(1) and (2)(A)–(C), defendant Vought and defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n(“CFPB”) are enjoined as set forth below until further order of this Court.  This order shall bind \nthe defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any other persons \nwho are in active concert or participation with them, such as personnel from the Department of \nGovernment Efficiency (“DOGE”) or the U.S. Digital Service. \nIt is hereby ORDERED that: \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 88     Filed 03/28/25     Page 2 of 3\n1.  Defendants, shall maintain and shall not delete, destroy, remove, or impair any data or \nother CFPB records covered by the Federal Records Act (hereafter “agency data”) \nexcept in accordance with the procedures described in 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33.  This \nmeans that Defendants shall maintain and shall not delete, destroy, remove, or impair \nagency data from any database or information system controlled by, or stored on behalf \nof, the CFPB.  The term “agency data” includes any data or CFPB records stored on \nthe CFPB’s premises, on physical media, on  a cloud server, or otherwise.   The \ndefendants must take all necessary steps to ensure that its contractors do the same. \n \n2.  Defendants shall reinstate all probationary and term employees terminated between \nFebruary 10, 2025 and the date of this order, including but not limited to, Julia Barnard, \nthe Private Student Loan Ombudsman. \n \n3.  Defendants shall not terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the \nindividual employee’s performance or conduct; and defendants shall not issue any \nnotice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee.  \n \n4.  Defendants  shall  not  enforce  the  February  10,  2025  stop-work  order  or  require \nemployees to take administrative leave in furtherance of that order, and defendants shall \nnot reinstitute or seek to achieve the outcome of a work stoppage, whether through a  \nstop-work order, an order directing employees to take administrative leave, or any other \nmeans.  \n \n5.  To  ensure  that  employees  can  perform  their  statutorily  mandated  functions,  the \ndefendants must provide them with either fully-equipped office space, or permission to \nwork remotely and laptop computers that are enabled to connect securely to the agency \nserver through the Citrix Virtual Desktop or another similar program. \n \n6.  Defendants shall ensure that in accordance with 12 U.S.C. §5492(b)(3), the CFPB \nOffice of Consumer Response continues to maintain a single, toll-free telephone \nnumber, a website, and a database for the centralized collection of consumer complaints \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00381-ABJ     Document 88     Filed 03/28/25     Page 3 of 3\nregarding consumer financial products and services, and that it continues to monitor \nand respond to those complaints, including by providing Elevated Case Management.  \n \n7.  Defendants  shall  rescind  all  notices  of  contract  termination  issued  on  or  after \nFebruary 11, 2025, and they may not reinitiate the wholesale cancellation of contracts.  \nThis provision does not prohibit the defendants from ordering that work or services \nunder specific contracts be halted based on an individualized assessment that the \ncontract involved is unnecessary for the agency to fulfill its statutory functions.  To \nensure that this Court can award full relief at the end of the case, however, the \ndefendants may not finalize the termination of any contract.  \n \n8.  Defendants shall file a report with the Court by April 4, 2025 confirming that all \nindividuals and entities that fall within Fed. R. Civ.
