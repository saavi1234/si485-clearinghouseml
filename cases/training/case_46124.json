    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration's termination of a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. On February 11, 2025, Cathy Harris, a duly appointed/confirmed Member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. She sued President Trump, the Secretary of Treasury, the Acting Chairman of the Merit System Protection Board, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Director and Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office to challenge her firing, which she alleged violated 5 U.S.C. &sect; 1202, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Separation of Powers. Represented by private counsel, the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney fees. Simultaneously with the complaint, the plaintiff also filed an emergency motion for temporary restraining order (TRO) to pause her firing.</p>\r\n<p>The key precedent in the case is the 1935 case of <em>Humphrey&rsquo;s Executor v. United States</em>, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), in which the Supreme Court held that the president lacked the authority to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission whose tenure was protected by statute. In 2020, in <em>Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, 140 S. Ct. 2183 (2020), the Court cut back the <em>Humphrey's Executor</em> rule, holding that the statute protecting the CFPB's single director&mdash;allowing his removal only for &ldquo;inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\" unconstitutionally infringed the President's exercise of \"the Executive power.\"&nbsp; But the Court expressly stated that Seila Law's holding did not reach for-cause removal protection for members of a multi-member commission, such as the MSPB.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Rudolph Contreras. On Feb. 18, Judge Contreras granted the TRO, ordering the plaintiff's restoration as Chair of the MSPB until the court ruled whether a preliminary injunction should issue--a hearing on that was set for March 3, 2025. 775 F.Supp.3d 86. On Feb. 20, the government filed a district court motion for a stay of this order; Judge Contreras rejected a stay. 2025 WL 2576527. The government appealed, but while the appeal was being briefed, Judge Contreras granted summary judgment and an injunction and declaratory judgment on March 4, 2025. 775 F.Supp.3d 164. The court declared that Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris remains a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board and ordered that she shall continue to serve as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board until her term expires pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &sect; 1202, unless she is removed earlier for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office under that statute. It enjoined the defendants from treating the plaintiff as having been removed, denying or obstructing her access to any of the benefits or resources of her office, placing a replacement in her position, or otherwise recognizing any other person as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board in Harris&rsquo;s position. &nbsp;___ F.Supp. 3d ___, 2025 WL 679303.</p>\r\n<p>This government immediately appealed, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated that appeal with the pending appeal of the Temporary Restraining Order; oral argument was held on March 18, 2025, before Judges Henderson, Millett and Walker. On March 28, 2025, each member of the panel issued a different opinion: Judges Walker and Henderson voted for granting the government's emergency motions for stay; Judge Millett dissented. &nbsp;2025 WL 2576684. 2025 WL 980278.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sought en banc review and an administrative stay of the panel decision. On April 7, 2025, by a vote of 7-4, the en banc court of appeals vacated the panel&rsquo;s stay, allowing the district court's injunction to take effect. 2025 WL 1021435. The court read the Supreme Court case of Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), to establish the lawfulness of &ldquo;removal restrictions for governmental officials on multimember adjudicatory boards.&rdquo;&nbsp; By a vote of 6-5, the court also denied the government&rsquo;s request to stay the vacatur of the panel&rsquo;s order for seven days to give the government time to seek Supreme Court relief. &nbsp;2025 WL 1033740.</p>\r\n<p>The government immediately sought a stay from the Supreme Court; Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay on April 9. 2025 WL 1063917.&nbsp; Then, on May 22, the Court granted a longer-lasting stay during the disposition of the case in the D.C. Circuit and any review in the Supreme Court. 145 S.Ct. 1415. Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson, dissented.&nbsp; The Court's unsigned majority opinion stated:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and<br />MSPB exercise considerable executive power. But we do not ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or MSPB falls within . . . a recognized exception; that question is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>___ S.Ct. ___, 2025 WL 1464804.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, oral argument was held in the D.C. Circuit on May 16, 2025. On September 22, the Supreme Court notified the D.C. Circuit that it declined to grant certiorari prior to judgement.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

The case was assigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras, who granted a TRO on February 18, ordering the plaintiff's reinstatement.

President Trump lawfully removed plaintiff from her post. \nThe States ceded sovereign authority to the federal government when they \njoined the union on the understanding that the power of the federal government was \nlimited, that this power would be divided among multiple branches of government, \nand that the States and their citizens would be able to hold federal officials democrat-\nically accountable for their exercise of that power. Yet when it comes to independent \nagencies, none of that is true. Federal power is instead consolidated in a select few \naccountable to no one. And that naturally leads to the expansion of that power.  \nAmici have an interest in ensuring that federal officials exercise their power—\npower that flows from the States themselves—within constitutional limits. After all, \n“[s]eparation-of-powers principles” do not just “protect each branch of government \nfrom incursion by the others”; they “protect the individual” and state sovereignty as \nwell. Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011). The issue here—and the sepa-\nration-of-powers principles involved in resolving it—go to the heart of the federalist \nbargain struck by the Framers. \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris challenges President Trump’s authority to remove \nher from her presidentially appointed position as a member of the Merit Systems \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 10 of 28\nProtection Board (“MSPB”). But as a member of that Board, she exercises substantial \nexecutive power—namely, the power to enforce compliance with the Board’s decisions \nregarding the employment of individuals in the federal civil service—and is answer-\nable to no one except the President. Because she is a principal officer exercising exec-\nutive power on behalf of the President, the Constitution requires that she be remov-\nable at the President’s will. The provision of 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) purporting to allow \nher removal “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” is there-\nfore unconstitutional. \nThat bedrock principle safeguards state sovereignty. When the States surren-\ndered some of their sovereign power to the federal government upon joining the un-\nion, they never would have imagined unaccountable officials wielding that power in-\ndependent of anyone who must answer to the people or the States for its exercise. \nThat was not what the Constitution promised them. Yet when it comes to independ-\nent agencies and tenure-protected executive officers, that is precisely what the States \nget. When independent agencies and tenure-protected officers wield executive power \noutside the purview of a democratically elected President, it not only usurps the Pres-\nident’s authority, it strikes at the core of the compact the States agreed to at the \nFounding. And state sovereignty and individual liberty suffer.  \nNor can this Court grant the relief that plaintiff seeks in substance: an injunc-\ntion ordering her reinstatement. Just as Congress may not restrain the President’s \nremoval power over executive officials, courts may not order an executive officer’s \nreinstatement. That limit on equity dates to the Founding and runs throughout the \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 11 of 28\nprecedents of the Supreme Court. The rule ensures effective governance, respects \nstate sovereignty, and yields reasoned jurisprudence. This Court should heed what \nthe Supreme Court held over a century ago: “a court of equity has no jurisdiction over \nthe appointment and removal of public officers.” In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 \n(1888). \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should deny plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunctive relief and \njudgment on the merits. Core separation-of-powers principles, bolstered by long his-\ntorical understanding, require that the President have the authority to remove exec-\nutive branch officials. That limitation on Congress’s power indirectly preserves state \nsovereignty  by  ensuring  that  “independent  agencies”  are  politically  accountable \nshould they attempt to intrude in state affairs. And a federal court would in any event \nlack the authority to reinstate plaintiff to her post. \nI.  The President has absolute authority to remove members of the Merit \nSystems Protection Board. \n“‘[T]he ‘executive Power’—all of it—is ‘vested in a President, who must ‘take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. \nBureau, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 1; id. § 3). And \n“if any power whatsoever is in its nature Executive, it is the power of appointing, \noverseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789) \n(J. Madison). That necessarily includes the authority to remove executive officers. \nIndeed, “lesser officers must remain accountable to the President,” for it is his “au-\nthority they wield.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213. Without the power to remove, the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 12 of 28\nPresident lacks the ability to compel compliance with his directives, id. at 213–14, \nand thus to fulfill his oath to execute the law, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \nGiven the “necessity of an energetic executive,” The Federalist No. 70, at 472 \n(Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke, ed., 1961), and the legislative branch’s historic tendency \nto “draw[] all power into its impetuous vortex,” The Federalist No. 48, at 333 (Madi-\nson) (Jacob E. Cooke, ed., 1961), it is critical that the President’s authority to direct \nand supervise the executive branch in the performance of its functions be protected \nfrom legislative encroachment. As a result, the Supreme Court has recognized only \ntwo exceptions to the President’s otherwise “exclusive and illimitable power of re-\nmoval.” Humphrey’s Ex’r v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 627 (1935); see also Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 215 (referring to the President’s “unrestricted removal power”). Nei-\nther exception covers a member of the MSPB. \nThe first exception is for certain inferior officers, and it has been applied to \nonly two: a naval cadet-engineer, United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886), and \nthe so-called independent counsel, Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988). Whatever \nits continuing vitality, that inferior-officer exception is inapplicable to members of \nthe MSPB. Members of the MSPB, who are appointed by the President and confirmed \nby the Senate, 5 U.S.C. § 1201, do not have a superior other than the President. See, \ne.g., id. §1204(a)(3) (Board reports directly to the President). They thus qualify as \nprincipal officers under the chief criterion the Supreme Court has recognized for de-\ntermining whether an Officer of the United States is principal or inferior. See United \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 13 of 28\nStates v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021); Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n662–63 (1997). \nThe second exception, recognized in Humphrey’s Executor and later in Wiener \nv. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), is for “a multimember body of experts, balanced \nalong partisan lines, that perform[s] legislative and judicial functions and [i]s said \nnot to exercise any executive power.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216. That exception does \nnot apply here either, because the MSPB exercises substantial executive power. First, \nthe Board resolves disputes about employment within the executive branch and may \n“take final action on any such matter.” 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1). The Board may “order \nany Federal agency or employee to comply with” its decision, after which the Board \n“shall . . . enforce compliance with any such order.” Id. § 1204(a)(2). If compliance is \nnot forthcoming, the Board may appoint attorneys to represent it in civil litigation \nrelating to its orders, id. §1204(i), where the Board is often the “named respondent.” \nId. § 7703(a)(2). On top of this quintessentially executive enforcement authority, the \nBoard also regularly evaluates “whether the public interest in a civil service free of \nprohibited personnel practices is being adequately protected” and reports its findings \ndirectly to Congress and the President. Id. § 1204(a)(3). The MSPB, in sum, exercises \na significant “part of the executive power vested by the Constitution in the President” \nand should be considered a part of the executive department. Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 \nU.S. at 628. The members of the MSPB must be fully accountable to the President, \njust like any other executive officers, and cannot be shielded from presidential super-\nvision by a statute restricting the grounds on which they may be removed. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 14 of 28\nIf there were any question about that analysis, the Humphrey’s Executor ex-\nception should be interpreted as narrowly as possible. Humphrey’s Executor indulged \nthe fiction that a so-called “independent” agency “exercises no part of the executive \npower vested by the Constitution in the President.” 295 U.S. at 628. It went so far as \nto propose the existence of a new class of officers—“a de facto fourth branch of Gov-\nernment,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring)—that acted “in part \nquasi-legislatively and in part quasi-judicially.” Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 U.S. at 628. \nHumphrey’s Executor did so based on reasoning “devoid of textual or historical prec-\nedent for the novel principle it set forth.” Morrison, 487 U.S. at 726 (Scalia, J., dis-\nsenting). If an officer exercises “quasi-legislative” power, that officer belongs in the \nlegislative branch. If, on the other hand, an officer exercises “quasi-adjudicative” \npower, that officer belongs in the judicial branch. It could hardly be otherwise, since \nCongress “lacks the authority to delegate its legislative power.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 247 (Thomas, J., concurring) (citing Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 531 \nU.S. 457, 472 (2001)). Congress also “cannot authorize the use of judicial power by \nofficers acting outside of the bounds of Article III.” Id. (citing Stern v. Marshall, 564 \nU.S. 462, 484 (2011)).1 In suggesting to the contrary, Humphrey’s Executor defied one \n \n1 There are exceptions, of course, as part of the checks and balances of govern-\nment. For example, the Constitution gives the President a limited role in the legisla-\ntive process (e.g., to “recommend to [Congress] such Measures as he shall judge nec-\nessary and expedient,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; and to decide whether to “approve” an \nact of Congress upon presentment, U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2). An executive officer \nmight assist the President in performing these duties. But these explicit textual ex-\nceptions merely prove the rule that no implicit exceptions for “quasi-legislative” or \n“quasi-adjudicative” functions exist. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 15 of 28\nof the most basic principles of the separation of powers embodied in the American \nexperiment. \nNot surprisingly, Humphrey’s Executor has seen its already shaky foundations \neroded over the years. In Morrison, the Supreme Court sidestepped Humphrey’s Ex-\necutor’s troublesome reliance “on the terms ‘quasi-legislative’ and ‘quasi-judicial,’” in-\nstead grounding its endorsement of tenure protection for the independent counsel on \nthe conclusion that tenure protection did not “unduly trammel[] on executive author-\nity.” 487 U.S. at 689, 691. The decision similarly avoided scrutiny in Free Enterprise \nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, in part because the parties \nthere “agree[d] that the Commissioners [of the Securities and Exchange Commission] \ncannot themselves be removed by the President except under the Humphrey’s Execu-\ntor standard of ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’” 561 U.S. 477, \n487 (2010) (quoting Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 U.S. at 620). But the majority opinion in \nFree Enterprise Fund is replete with reminders that allowing officers to “execute the \nlaws” without plenary presidential supervision “is contrary to Article II’s vesting of \nthe executive power in the President”—a principle squarely in conflict with Humph-\nrey’s Executor. 561 U.S. at 496. And most recently, in Seila Law and again in Collins \nv. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), the Supreme Court took particular care not to widen \nthe application of Humphrey’s Executor beyond its essential facts. This history coun-\nsels in favor of treating the exception for politically balanced, multi-member commis-\nsions “said not to exercise any executive power” narrowly. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 16 of 28\nAnd because that exception does not fit the MSPB, the members of the Board are not \nentitled to the removal protections set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d). \nII.  By threatening the separation of powers, “independent” executive of-\nficers and agencies in turn threaten state sovereignty. \nWhether Congress may shield executive officials from presidential oversight \nhas grave ramifications for amici States. Before joining the union, “the several States \nhad absolute and unlimited sovereignty within their respective boundaries.” Respu-\nblica v. Cobbett, 3 U.S. 467, 473 (Pa. 1798). By entering a compact under the Consti-\ntution,  the  States  “surrendered”  some  of  that  sovereignty  to  the  United  States. \nChisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 435 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting). But “in \nevery instance where [their] sovereignty ha[d] not been delegated to the United \nStates, [the States remained] completely sovereign.” Id. The result was a “system of \ngovernment” that “differ[ed], in form and spirit, from all other governments, that \nha[d] [t]heretofore existed in the world”—a carefully calibrated balance of power be-\ntween States and the federal government. Respublica, 3 U.S. at 473. “[T]he United \nStates ha[s] no claim to any authority but such as the States have surrendered to \n[it].” Chisholm, 2 U.S. at 435 (Iredell, J., dissenting).  \nWhen ceding that sovereign power, the States ensured that it would be divided \namong distinct branches of the federal government. They “viewed the principle of the \nseparation of powers as the central guarantee of a just government.” Freytag v. \nComm’r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 870 (1991). To protect their sovereignty \nand preserve individual liberty, the founding States “scrupulously avoid[ed] concen-\ntrating power in the hands of any single individual.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 223. The \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 17 of 28\none exception was the executive branch. Because an “energetic executive” is “essen-\ntial” to perform that branch’s “unique responsibilities,” the Framers decided to “for-\ntif[y]” that power in “one man.” Id. at 223–24. To mitigate their concerns over power \nconsolidation, they made the executive branch “the most democratic and politically \naccountable” in the federal government. Id. at 224. Only the President and Vice Pres-\nident are “elected by the entire Nation.” Id. And because of the nature of the electoral \ncollege, they are elected not just by the People, but also by the States. This carefully \ncalibrated “allocation of powers”—essential to the compact the States agreed to upon \njoining the union—protects “libert[y]” and state “sovereignty.” Bond, 564 U.S. at 221. \nIndependent agencies threaten that compact. See, e.g., Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n246 (Thomas, J., concurring) (observing that cases like Humphrey’s Executor “laid the \nfoundation for a fundamental departure from our constitutional structure”). They \nrepresent one of the founding States’ worst fears: the consolidation of power in one or \na few democratically unaccountable officials. See 591 U.S. at 222–24. Without “a po-\nlitically accountable officer [to] take responsibility” for the exercise of executive \npower, “the public [and the States] can only wonder ‘on whom the blame or the pun-\nishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures ought really to \nfall.’” Arthrex, 594 U.S at 16 (quoting The Federalist No. 70, at 476 (A. Hamilton) \n(Jacob E. Cooke, ed., 1961)). By eviscerating the “clear and effective chain of command \ndown from the President, on whom all people vote,” the actions of independent agen-\ncies are deprived of “legitimacy and accountability to the public” and the States. Id. \nat 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 18 of 28\nOne need not search long for an egregious example. Just last year, the Federal \nTrade Commission (“FTC”) banned noncompete clauses in employment contracts na-\ntionwide. Non-Compete Clause Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 38,342 (May 7, 2024). In “the most \nextraordinary assertion of authority in the Commission’s history,” a few unaccounta-\nble commissioners “prohibit[ed] a business practice that has been lawful for centu-\nries” and “invalidate[d] thirty million existing contracts.” Fed. Trade Comm’n, Dis-\nsenting Statement of Commissioner Andrew N. Ferguson 1 (June 28, 2024), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/3j8dxrtx. And they did so even though “[c]ommercial agreements tradition-\nally are the domain of state law.” Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, \n262 (1979). Nor did the FTC care that 46 states had exercised their sovereign author-\nity to permit noncompete agreements in some form. See Ferguson Dissent at 14. But \nbecause of the FTC’s independence, the States have no one to hold to account for that \ndramatic intrusion on their sovereignty.2  \nGovernment actors who exercise significant authority must ultimately account \nin the chain of command to the States and their citizens. Anything else is not the \nsovereign authority the States ceded the federal government when they joined the \nunion. \n \n2 The FTC’s authority to promulgate the non-compete rule is being tested in \nseveral pending cases. See Ryan, LLC v. FTC, No. 3:24-cv-986, 2024 WL 3879954 \n(N.D. Tex. Aug. 20, 2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-10951 (5th Cir. Oct. 18, 2024); \nProps. of the Vills., Inc. v. FTC, No. 5:24-cv-316, 2024 WL 3870380 (M.D. Fla. Aug. \n15, 2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-13102 (11th Cir. Sept. 24, 2024). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 19 of 28\nIII.  Federal courts lack equitable authority to reinstate public officials. \nNot only is plaintiff wrong on the merits, she is wrong on the remedy. Federal \ncourts may not reinstate public officers absent an act of Congress. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-5(g) (authorizing courts to “reinstate[]” employees who suffer discrimina-\ntion). Plaintiff has cited no such act. Nor is Congress’s silence surprising—orders re-\ninstating public officials hamper effective governance, invade state sovereignty, and \nbeget rushed jurisprudence. \nA. Plaintiff seeks relief the courts cannot grant. She conspicuously avoids using \nthe word “reinstatement,” instead framing her requested remedy as an “[o]rder” that \nshe “not . . . in any way be treated as having been removed” from office “or otherwise \nbe obstructed from her ability to carry out her duties.” DE1 at 11, Harris v. Bessent, \nNo. 1:25-cv-00412 (D.D.C.). But as plaintiff has already been removed from office, it \nis inescapable that the equitable remedy of reinstatement is what she seeks. See Lit-\ntlefield v. Perry, 88 U.S. 205, 223 (1874) (Waite, C.J.) (“A court of equity looks to sub-\nstance rather than form.”). The only equitable remedies that a federal court may \ngrant are those “traditionally accorded by courts of equity.” Bessent v. Dellinger, No. \n24A790, slip op. at 3 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025) (Gorsuch, J., joined by Alito, J., dissenting) \n(quoting Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, \n318 (1999)). And history teaches that “[a] court of equity has no jurisdiction over the \nappointment and removal of public officers.” Walton v. House of Representatives of \nOkla., 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924); Dellinger, No. 24A790, slip op. at 4 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting) (finding it “well settled that a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 20 of 28\nappointment and removal of public officers” (quoting Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212)). “To \nbe sure, throughout the Nation’s history, various presidentially appointed officials \n. . . have contested their removal—and courts have heard and passed on their claims. \nBut those officials have generally sought remedies like backpay, not injunctive relief \nlike reinstatement.” Dellinger, No. 24A790, slip op. at 4 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (cit-\ning, e.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926); Humphrey’s Ex’r). \nThat rule flows from English common law. Recognizing the critical “distinction \nbetween judicial and political power,” English courts historically would not wield eq-\nuity to vindicate a litigant’s “political right[]” to office. Georgia v. Stanton, 73 U.S. \n(6 Wall.) 50, 71, 76 & n.20 (1867) (collecting cases); see Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212 (col-\nlecting cases, including Attorney General v. Earl of Clarendon, 17 Ves. Jr. 491, 498, \n34 Eng. Rep. 190, 193 (Ch. 1810)). In Earl of Clarendon, for instance, the English \nCourt of Chancery declined to remove public-school officers on the ground that they \nlacked necessary legal qualifications. 17 Ves. Jr. at 493, 34 Eng. Rep. at 191. Accord-\ning to that court, a court of equity “has no jurisdiction with regard either to the elec-\ntion or the [removal] of” officers. Id. at 498, 34 Eng. Rep. at 193. Contemporary Eng-\nlish cases tracked that reasoning. See also Joseph Story, Commentaries on Equity \nPleadings and the Incidents Thereof §§ 467–70 (2d ed. 1840) (explaining that tradi-\ntional equity courts would not adjudicate rights of a “political nature” and citing ex-\namples); Seth Davis, Empire in Equity, 97 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1985, 2011–12 (2022).3 \n \n3 Although Earl of Clarendon and some other cases cited in Sawyer involved \ncorporate  officers,  those  legal  entities  were  historically  treated  more  like \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 21 of 28\nAmerican courts imported that principle after the Framing. In the early 19th \ncentury, courts nationwide denied that equity chancellors could afford a removed of-\nficial relief, even when the official’s ouster was illegal and unauthorized. Tappan v. \nGray, 9 Paige Ch. 506, 508–09 (Ch. Ct. N.Y. 1842); see also Hagner, 7 Watts & Serg. \nat 105; Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212 (collecting cases). Hagner is emblematic. In that case, \nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declined to enjoin a defendant from unlawfully \nacting as a school director because it possessed no more power than “an English court \nof chancery.” Hagner, 7 Watts & Serg. at 106–07. Because chancery courts tradition-\nally “would not sustain the injunction proceeding to try the election or [removal] of \ncorporators of any description,” Pennsylvania’s high court held that it could not ei-\nther. Id. Other courts took a similar tack throughout Reconstruction.4 \n \ngovernments and public entities. Colonial governments, for instance, were created \nthrough corporate charters, with “shareholders” acting like modern-day voters and \nvoting for corporate boards that looked like modern-day state and local governments. \nNikolas Bowie, Why the Constitution Was Written Down, 71 Stan. L. Rev. 1397, 1416–\n21 (2018); see also Letter from John Adams to the Inhabitants of the Colony of \nMassachusetts-Bay, April 1775, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-\n02-02-0072-0015.  And  as  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  noted  in  Hagner  v. \nHeyberger, limits on equitable jurisdiction that applied to “private corporations” \napply “à fortiori” to “the case of a public officer of a municipal character.” 7 Watts & \nSerg. 104, 105 (Penn. 1844); see also W.S. Holdsworth, English Corporation Law in \nthe 16th and 17th Centuries, 31 Yale L.J. 382, 383–84 (1922) (noting that for both \npublic and private corporations, “creation by and subordination to the state are the \nonly terms upon which the existence of large associations of men can be safely allowed \nto lead an active life”).  \n4 See, e.g., Cochran v. McCleary, 22 Iowa 75, 91 (1867) (“The right to a public \noffice or franchise cannot, as the authorities above cited show, be determined in eq-\nuity.”); Sheridan v. Colvin, 78 Ill. 237, 247 (1875) (“A court of equity is not a proper \ntribunal for determining disputed questions concerning the appointment of public of-\nficers, or their right to hold office[.]”); Delahanty v. Warner, 75 Ill. 185, 186 (1874) \n(court  of  chancery  had  no  power  to  restrain  local  officials  from  removing  the \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 22 of 28\nThe Supreme Court later confirmed that historical equitable constraint in \nSawyer. There, a locally elected officer sought an injunction from a federal court bar-\nring local officials from removing him. 124 U.S. at 201. After the local officials were \nheld in contempt of that injunction, the Court issued a writ of habeas corpus to vacate \ntheir convictions because the injunction was issued without jurisdiction. The Court \nexplained that a federal court in equity “has no jurisdiction . . . over the appointment \nand removal of public officials.” Id. at 210. And a wall of contemporary treatises ech-\noed that understanding.5 As one 19th-century commentator put it, “[n]o principle of \nthe law of injunctions, and perhaps no doctrine of equity jurisprudence, is more defi-\nnitely fixed or more clearly established than that courts of equity will not interfere \nby injunction to determine questions concerning the appointment of public officers or \ntheir title to office.” 2 High, Law of Injunctions § 1312. \nThe Supreme Court has doubled down on that rule. A decade after Sawyer, the \nCourt reiterated that equity courts may “not, by injunction, restrain an executive of-\nficer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain the \nappointment of another.” White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898). The Court restated \nthe point in Walton: While federal courts are “particularly . . . without jurisdiction \n \nsuperintendent of streets from his post); Beebe v.

And it repeated the principle in Baker v. Carr—“federal equity \npower [may] not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer.” \n369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962); see also Fineran v. Bailey, 2 F.2d 363, 363 (5th Cir. 1924) \n(“It is well settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court that a District Court of the \nUnited States has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public offic-\ners.”).  \nSimilarly, there is no established historical tradition of equity courts rein-\nstalling officials, at least not without express statutory authorization. “No English \ncase has been found of a bill for an injunction to restrain the appointment or removal \nof a municipal officer.” Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212. Aside from the outlier case discussed \nin this Court’s order granting the temporary restraining order in this case6 and the \nvery recent order in Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 1:25-cv-385, 2025 WL 471022 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 12, 2025), we know of no case in which a federal court has ordered the reinstate-\nment plaintiff seeks.7 The lack of historical pedigree for reinstatement suggests that \n \n6 See DE9 at 13–14, Harris v. Bessent, No. 1:25-cv-412 (D.D.C.) (discussing \nBerry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as moot, \n732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam)). \n7 The only other arguable candidate we have found is Bond v. Floyd, in which \nthe Supreme Court held that the Georgia legislature violated the First Amendment \nin refusing to seat a newly elected member for engaging in anti-Vietnam War speech \nwhile the member-elect was a private citizen. 385 U.S. 116, 137 (1966). But Bond v. \nFloyd did not grapple with the limits on the federal courts’ remedial authority dis-\ncussed by Walton or Sawyer. See id. At most, Bond v. Floyd represents an implicit \n“drive-by” ruling that carries “no precedential effect.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 24 of 28\nit “was unknown to traditional equity practice,” Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 327, \nand divorced from the “jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court of Chancery \nin England at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the enactment of the \noriginal Judiciary Act, 1789 (1 Stat. 73),” id. at 318–19. \nB. Tradition is often grounded in common sense. Here, there are at least three \nreasons why courts should not wade into the messy business of reinstatement. \nFirst, reinstatement hampers effective governance. Like a grain of sand in a \ngear, forcing the sovereign to retain an official it believes is unfit threatens to halt \nthe levers of government and risks intra-office “chaos.” Nixon v. United States, 506 \nU.S. 224, 236 (1993) (questioning what relief a federal court could grant a judge who \nhad been impeached and removed from office); Abbott v. Thetford, 529 F.2d 695, 708 \n(5th Cir. 1976) (Gewin, J., dissenting) (arguing that reinstating a state judicial em-\nployee would impair the court’s judicial functions), majority vacated and dissent \nadopted upon reh’g en banc, 534 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 1976). \nSecond, when extended to state officers, reinstatement invades state sover-\neignty. “The authority of the people of the States to determine” their state officers \n“goes beyond an area traditionally regulated by the States; it is a decision of the most \nfundamental sort for a sovereign entity” that lies at “the heart of representative gov-\nernment.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460, 463 (1991). The historical limit on \n \nEnv’t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998). The issue of the equitable authority of the federal courts \n“merely lurk[ed] in the record,” so the holding of Bond v. Floyd cannot “be considered \nas having . . . constitute[d] precedent[]” on the question. Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, \n511 (1925). \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 25 of 28\nfederal reinstatement power preserves “the scrupulous regard for the rightful inde-\npendence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts.” \nAla. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. S. Ry. Co., 341 U.S. 341, 349 (1951). \nFinally, reinstatement encourages rushed jurisprudence. When officials be-\nlieve that reinstatement lies just behind the courthouse door, they will often seek \nemergency injunctive relief. See, e.g., Warren v. DeSantis, No. 4:22-cv-302 (N.D. Fla.) \n(in which a district judge ordered an extraordinarily compressed trial schedule of just \nover three months in a case posing many complex issues of constitutional signifi-\ncance). Those fast-paced proceedings “tend to force judges into making rushed, high-\nstakes, low-information decisions” on constitutional issues of immense importance. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) (mem.) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). \n   \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 34     Filed 02/28/25     Page 26 of 28\nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunctive relief and \njudgment on the merits. The Court should also deny plaintiff’s request for a declara-\ntory judgment, a permanent injunction, and a writ of mandamus. \nFebruary 28, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  JAMES UTHMEIER \n  Attorney General of Florida \n   \n  JEFFREY PAUL DESOUSA  \n  Acting Solicitor General \n  NATHAN A.

LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. \n197, 203 (2020) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 1; id., § 3).  But Ms. Harris argues that this Court \nshould empower her to exercise some of the executive Power as a principal officer of the United \nStates, unaccountable to the democratically elected President, even after the President has chosen to \nremove her.  Article II—and Supreme Court precedents construing it—foreclose that argument.  And \nsetting aside the merits, Ms. Harris asks for relief beyond the power of this Court—an order that \nwould reinstate her in office and bar the President from replacing her.  Such an order would exceed \nthe  traditional  equitable  authority  of  courts  and  violate  the  longstanding  separation-of-powers \nprinciple that courts lack jurisdiction to enjoin the President in the exercise of his official duties.  The \nCourt should decline to interfere in the President’s exercise of his lawful authority over the executive \nbranch. \nPlaintiff’s claims fail on the merits because the statutory for-cause removal protection for \nMerit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) members is unconstitutional.  “[A]s a general matter,” the \nexecutive power encompasses “the authority to remove those who assist [the President] in carrying \nout his duties.”  Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 513–14 (2010).  The \nSupreme Court has recognized “only two exceptions to the President’s unrestricted removal power.”  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 214.  One exception, for certain inferior officers with limited duties, plainly does \nnot encompass principal officers such as Plaintiff. \nPlaintiff relies on the second exception, exemplified by Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 \nU.S. 602 (1935), for “a multimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed \nlegislative and judicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 216.  But that exception does not apply because the MSPB exercises executive power.  Its \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 9 of 30\nexecutive functions include issuing binding orders to federal agencies and employees and enforcing \ncompliance with those orders, litigating in federal court to defend its decisions and actions, and \nreviewing rules of the Office of Personnel Management.  Plaintiff essentially asks this Court to expand \nHumphrey’s Executor, but the Supreme Court has read that case narrowly as “represent[ing] . . . the \noutermost constitutional limits of permissible congressional restrictions on the President’s removal \npower.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218 (citation and quotation omitted). \nIrrespective of the merits of Plaintiff’s claims, she is not entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief she seeks, which would have the effect of reinstating her in office.  Courts lack \n“jurisdiction . . . to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.”  Mississippi v. Johnson, \n71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1867).  Plaintiff’s requested relief would have the impermissible effect of \nrestraining the President because it would prevent him from effectuating the removal of Plaintiff or \nappointing her replacement.  Moreover, federal courts are limited to granting traditional equitable \nremedies, and “a court of equity will not, by injunction, restrain an executive officer from making a \nwrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain the appointment of another.”  White v. Berry, \n171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898).  That is why executive officers challenging their removal by the President \nhave traditionally sought back pay, rather than reinstatement. \nPlaintiff has also failed to satisfy the remaining injunction factors.  Loss of government \nemployment generally does not qualify as irreparable harm, Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 & n.68 \n(1974), and Plaintiff cites no exceptional circumstances that would warrant a different result here.  She \nmostly invokes potential harm to the MSPB itself, but such claimed harm to the MSPB is not hers to \nraise.  Moreover, the balance of equities and public interest strongly weigh against injunctive relief.  \nConsistent with the Framers’ vision, it is in the public interest for the executive power of the United \nStates to be exercised by the democratically elected President and officers accountable to the President. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 10 of 30\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background. \nIn 1883, Congress established the Civil Service Commission, comprised of three presidentially \nappointed Commissioners, tasked with helping the President prepare suitable civil service rules for \napplicants for federal employment.  See Act of Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, § 2, 22 Stat. 403 (1883).  Over the \nfollowing decades, the CSC grew more and more powerful, and gained a steadily larger ambit.  See \nCongressional Research Service, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB): A Legal Overview, at 2 (March 25, \n2019) (“CRS Report”).  So in 1978, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act, splitting the \nfunctions of the CSC between two separate new agencies: the Office of Personnel Management and \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 118–44 (1978).  The \nAct charged OPM with conducting personnel management functions formerly performed by the CSC, \nwhile the MSPB was charged with performing the CSC’s “hearing, adjudication, and appeals functions, \nand exercised its authority to enforce agency compliance with its decisions.”  CRS Report, supra, at 3. \nThe Act provides that the Board—like the CSC before it—shall consist of three Members, \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  5 U.S.C. § 1201.  No more \nthan two Members may belong to the same political party.  Id.  And by the Act’s terms, Board Members \ncan “be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. \n§ 1202(d). \nThe MSPB exercises tremendous power within the Executive Branch: In short, it supervises \nhow much of the Executive Branch supervises its workforce.  Most of all, the Board broadly oversees \nadverse employment actions taken against the bulk of the federal workforce—including with respect \nto removal or lengthier suspensions.  5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); see also id. § 7521(a); 5 C.F.R. § 1201.3(a).  \nAmong other things, the “MSPB is authorized to order . . . reinstatement, backpay, and attorney’s \nfees” to prevailing employees.  Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 6 (2012); see also Local 2578 \nAm. Fed. of Govt. Employees v. GSA, 711 F.2d 261, 265 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (describing “independent \nauthority” of MSPB to assess punishments handed down by other agencies).  The Board has the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 11 of 30\nauthority to “take final action on any such matter[s]” before it.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1).  And that \nincludes being able to order any federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision \n“issued by the Board . . . and enforce compliance with any such order.”  Id. § 1204(a)(2).   \nThe Board also has independent litigating authority to send its own attorneys to litigate civil \nactions outside the Supreme Court in connection with any of its functions.  Id. § 1204(i).  And under \ncertain  circumstances,  the  Board  itself  is  the  named  respondent  (and  thus  litigant)  in  judicial \nproceedings seeking review of Board decisions.  Id. § 7703(a)(2).  The MSPB is further empowered to \nreview rules issued by the Office of Personnel Management, a distinct executive agency, and can \ndeclare a rule to be invalid on their face or invalidly implemented if the MSPB determines that the rule \nwould require employees to commit prohibited personnel practices.  Id. § 1204(f); see also NTEU v. \nMSPB, 743 F.2d 895, 900 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (describing review process).  Upon making such a \ndetermination, the MSPB “shall require any agency . . . to cease compliance with” provisions that are \ninvalid on their face and “to correct any invalid implementation” of such a rule.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(f)(4). \nDecisions by the MSPB are generally subject to judicial review.  5 U.S.C. § 7703.  But the scope \nof such review is “extremely narrow,” and deferential.  U.S. Postal Serv. v. Gregory, 534 U.S. 1, 6-7 (2001). \nII.  Factual Background. \nPlaintiff Cathy Harris was first nominated by President Biden to serve as a Member of the \nMSPB on June 24, 2021.  Compl. ¶ 24.  She was renominated on January 4, 2022.  Id.  The Senate \nconfirmed her on May 25, 2022, and she was sworn in as a Member of the Board on June 1, 2022.  Id.  \nShe was sworn in as Chairman of the Board on March 14, 2024.  Id. ¶ 25. \nOn February 11, 2025, the Deputy Assistant to the President and the Deputy Director of the \nWhite House Presidential Personnel Office informed Plaintiff that the President was removing her \nfrom her position.  Compl. ¶ 26.  That same day, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit, and moved for a temporary \nrestraining order, requesting that she be reinstated.  See ECF No. 2-4.  On February 18, this Court \ngranted that motion, reinstating Plaintiff as Chairman of the MSPB, and enjoining all defendants \n“from removing Harris from her office or in any way treating her as having been removed.”  ECF \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 12 of 30\nNo. 9, at 21.  The Court then set a briefing schedule for a preliminary injunction, as well as merits \nbriefing. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. \n674, 689 (2008) (citation omitted).  It is “never awarded as of right,” id. at 690, and “should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion,” Mazurek v. Armstrong, \n520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (citation omitted); accord Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, \n1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The movant must satisfy a four-prong test, establishing “that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \nthat the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); accord Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. \n2011).  The “most important factor” is whether the movant has “established a likelihood of success \non the merits.”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Removal Restrictions Insulating MSPB Members Are Unconstitutional. \nPlaintiff contends that the President did not validly remove her from office because Members \nof the Merit Systems Protection Board may be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.”  5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).  But MSPB Members are principal officers who lead a \nfreestanding component within the Executive Branch and exercise executive power.  Accordingly, \nbecause the entirety of the executive power is vested in the President, see Art. II, § 1, cl. 1, the President \nmust be able to remove MSPB Members at will. \nA.  At-Will Removal Is the General Rule, and MSPB Does Not Fit Within Any \nExceptions.  \n1.  The Constitution vests the entirety of the “executive Power” in the President, who is given \nthe sole responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. \n1; id. § 3; see also Severino v. Biden, 71 F. 4th 1038, 1043–44 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  “[A]s a general matter,” \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 13 of 30\nthe executive power encompasses “the authority to remove those who assist [the President] in carrying \nout his duties.”  Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 513–14 (2010).  Without \nsuch power, the President would be unable to control those who aid him in executing the laws and \n“could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities.”  Id. at 514.     \nFor nearly a century, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed “the President’s power to \nremove—and thus supervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 204 (citing Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)).  The Supreme Court has recognized “only two \nexceptions to the President’s unrestricted removal power.”  Id.  First, in Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. \n602, the Supreme Court held that Congress could impose for-cause removal restrictions on “a \nmultimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and judicial \nfunctions and was said not to exercise any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.  Second, in \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886), the Court \nrecognized  an  exception  “for  inferior  officers  with  limited  duties  and  no  policymaking  or \nadministrative authority.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  Those exceptions represent the “outermost \nconstitutional limits of permissible restrictions on the President’s removal power” under current \nprecedent.  Id. (quoting PHH Corp. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 881 F.3d 75, 196 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting)).   \n2.  Members of the MSPB do not fit within either of these exceptions.  They are not inferior \nofficers with narrowly defined duties; to the contrary, they are principal officers appointed by the \nPresident with Senate confirmation, see U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2; 5 U.S.C. § 1201, oversee their own \ndepartment, and are not subservient to any other principal officer, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204.  See also Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 511 (explaining that a department “is a freestanding component of the \nExecutive Branch, not subordinate to or contained within any other such component”).  Nor does \nthe Humphrey’s Executor exception apply.  As the Supreme Court made clear in Seila Law, that exception \nis limited to “multimember bodies with ‘quasi-judicial’ or ‘quasi-legislative’ functions” that do not \nexercise executive power.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216–17 (quoting Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632).  \nThat narrow exception does not encompass the MSPB.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 14 of 30\nThe MSPB is no “mere legislative or judicial aid,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 199.  It is an \nindependent agency that performs many executive functions.  For instance, the MSPB “hear[s], \nadjudicate[s], or provide[s] for the hearing or adjudication” of matters within its jurisdiction and, \n“subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take[s] final action on any such matter.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(a)(1).  Following those adjudications, the MSPB can order relief including reinstatement, \nbackpay, and attorney’s fees.  See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 6.  And it can “order any Federal agency or \nemployee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board . . . and enforce compliance with \nany such order.”  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2).  This authority to issue final orders that affect the rights and \nobligations of parties is an executive function.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219 (explaining that the CFPB \nDirector exercises executive power because he “may unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal \nand equitable relief in administrative adjudications”).  \n The MSPB  can  also  exercise  authority over  other executive  agencies  by,  for example, \nreviewing rules of the Office of Personnel Management.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(f).  In certain cases—namely, \nthose involving misconduct—the Board can also modify or reduce the penalties that agencies impose \non their employees.  See Douglas v. Veterans Administration, 5 M.S.P.B. 313, 327–28 (1981).     \nFurther, the Board also has independent litigating authority to send its own attorneys (not \nDepartment of Justice attorneys) to litigate civil actions outside the Supreme Court in connection with \nany of its functions.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(i); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138–40 (recognizing \ninterpreting  and  enforcing  law  through  litigation  as  executive  function).    And  under  certain \ncircumstances, the Board itself is the named respondent (and thus a litigant) in judicial proceedings \nseeking review of Board decisions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703(a)(2).  These features distinguish the Board \nfrom a purely adjudicatory body.  Contra Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958) (upholding \nremoval restriction on member of body understood as purely adjudicatory).  \nIn short, the MSPB wields executive power and must be accountable to the President through \nthe removal power.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204 (“The President’s power to remove—and thus \nsupervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf follows from the text of Article II[.]”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 15 of 30\nB.  Plaintiff’s Contrary Arguments Are Meritless.  \n1.  Plaintiff’s contrary contention rests largely on an overbroad reading of Humphrey’s Executor \nand the cases that followed.  Plaintiff seeks to stretch those cases beyond their facts to reach a Board \nthat exercises significant executive power.  The Supreme Court in Seila Law made clear, however, that \nHumphrey’s Executor does not extend so far.  After Seila Law, “only a very narrow reading of those cases \nis still good law” and “little to nothing is left of the Humphrey’s exception to the general rule that the \nPresident may freely remove his subordinates.”  Severino, 71 F.4th at 1050 (Walker, J., concurring).1     \nIn  Humphrey’s  Executor,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  the  constitutionality  of  a  provision \nprohibiting  removal  of  Federal  Trade  Commissioners  absent  “inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.”  295 U.S. at 632.  Despite reaffirming Myers’s then-recent holding that the \nPresident “has unrestrictable power … to remove purely executive officers,” id. at 632, Humphrey’s \nExecutor concluded that Myers did not control because the FTC Commissioner at issue was “an officer \nwho occupies no place in the executive department and who exercises no part of the executive power \nvested by the Constitution in the President,” id. at 628.  Instead, Humphrey’s Executor understood the \nFTC to be “an administrative body” that “carr[ied] into effect legislative policies” and “perform[ed] \nother specified duties as a legislative or judicial aid.”  Id.  Those duties, according to the Court, \n“c[ould ]not in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive.”  Id.  The Court \nunderstood the FTC not to be exercising executive power at all but rather to “act[] in part quasi \nlegislatively and in part quasi judicially.”  Id.  On that understanding, Humphrey’s Executor found no \nconstitutional problem with restricting the removal of FTC Commissioners.  \nBecause Humphrey’s Executor rests on the understanding that the FTC exercised no executive \npower, Plaintiff’s contention that the MSPB falls within the Humphrey’s Executor exception because the \nMSPB “does not wield substantial executive power,” Pl.’s Mot. at 12, ECF No. 22 (emphasis added), \nfails.    As  just  explained,  Humphrey’s  Executor  approved  “for-cause  removal  protections  [for]  a \n \n1 While the government acknowledges that whatever little remains of Humphrey’s Executor is binding \non this Court until overturned by the Supreme Court, see Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, \n136 (2023), it preserves the argument that Humphrey’s Executor was wrongly decided.  See, e.g., Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 239–51 (Thomas and Gorsuch, JJ., concurring in part) (advocating for the Court to \n“reconsider Humphrey’s Executor in toto”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 16 of 30\nmultimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and judicial \nfunctions and was said not to exercise any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216 (emphasis \nadded).2  That case upheld removal protections for a body that was understood not to exercise \nexecutive power at all—not based on the Court’s analysis of how substantial the agency’s executive \npower was.  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 627–32.  To be sure, Seila Law once summarized the \nexception for multimember boards to cover those that do not exercise substantial executive power.  \nBut Seila Law likewise recognized the Court’s understanding in Humphrey’s Executor, describing that \ncase as “view[ing] the FTC (as it existed in 1935) as exercising ‘no part of the executive power,’” 591 \nU.S. at 216 (quoting Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628), and thus permitting for-cause removal \nprotections only for boards that do “not exercise any executive power,” id.      \nIn any event, the MSPB does wield “substantial” executive power.  As described above, the \nBoard has the authority to issue final decisions in administrative adjudications that award relief \nincluding backpay and reinstatement.3  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219 (explaining that the CFPB \nDirector exercises executive power because he “may unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal \nand equitable relief in administrative adjudications”).  It can order federal agencies and employees to \ncomply with its orders and enforce those orders where necessary.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2).  And its \nindependent litigating authority, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204(i), allows it to present and enforce interpretations \nof the law in federal courts, which is a quintessentially executive function.  Cf. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 138–\n40 (recognizing interpreting and enforcing law through litigation as executive function).  The fact that \nthe Board’s jurisdiction is limited to Executive Branch disputes, Pl.’s Mot. at 12–17, does not alter the \n \n2 The Court further explained that “[t]he Court’s conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive \npower has not withstood the test of time.”  Id. at 216 n.2.  Indeed, “[i]t is hard to dispute that the \npowers of the FTC at the time of Humphrey’s Executor would at the present time be considered \n‘executive,’ at least to some degree.”  Id. (quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690 n.28). \n3 Plaintiff contends that the Board does not have the final say in many matters because its decisions \nare appealable to Article III courts.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 15–16.  But judicial review of MSPB decisions is \n“extremely narrow,” and is intended “only to ascertain if the Board has met the minimum standards \nset forth in the statute.”  Gregory, 534 U.S. at 7.  And if Plaintiff’s argument were correct, executive \nagencies—or even Congress—would almost never have the “final say” because most agency actions—\nand statutes—are subject to some form of judicial review.  See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706 (providing for \njudicial review of agency action).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 17 of 30\nconclusion that this authority is substantial.  To the contrary, that the Board exercises these powers in \nthe context of employment disputes among Executive Branch employees only accentuates the degree \nto which its decisions and actions in court bear directly on the President’s execution of his Article II \nduty.  The MSPB’s broad authority to affect management of the Executive Branch workforce \nconstitutes broad authority to control that workforce’s exercise of executive power in “dictat[ing] and \nenforc[ing] policy . . . affecting millions of Americans,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.4   \nPlaintiff’s policy arguments about the supposedly unique need for independence at the MPSB, \nPl.’s Mot. at 13–14, do not move the needle.  Similar arguments were made and rejected in Seila Law \nitself.  Cf. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring in part) (urging that Congress had strong \npolicy justifications for enacting the tenure protections for the CFPB Director that were held unlawful \nby the majority).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has since rejected that entire mode of reasoning:  In \nCollins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), the Court refused to entertain arguments about whether the \nfunctions of certain executive agencies were less significant as compared to others’.  The Court \nexplained that “[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the relative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies” and that “the constitutionality of removal restrictions” \ndoes not “hinge[] on such an inquiry.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 253.  Because the MSPB exercises executive \npower—indeed, substantial executive power—it does not fall within the narrow Humphrey’s Executor \nexception.  Board members must therefore be removable at will by the President.   \n2.  Likewise, Plaintiff’s argument that the MSPB is a “traditional independent agency” run by \na multimember board, Pl.’s Mot. at 17–20, also does not justify its inclusion in the Humphrey’s Executor \nexception.  Seila Law did not extend Humphrey’s Executor to cover any “traditional independent agency” \nrun by a multi-member board.  Rather, the touchstone of the Humphrey’s Executor exception, as Seila \n \n4 Although many functions of the MSPB are clearly of an executive nature, even for functions that \ncould be said to resemble judicial activity, it would be “overstate[d]” to assert that the MSPB \n“exercise[s] . . . ‘judicial power.’”  Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 n.4 (2013).  “Agencies make \nrules . . . and conduct adjudications . . . and have done so since the beginning of the Republic.  These \nactivities  take  ‘legislative’  and  ‘judicial’  forms,  but  they  are  exercises  of—indeed,  under  our \nconstitutional structure they must be exercises of—the ‘executive Power.’”  Id. (quoting U.S. Const., \nart. II, § 1, cl. 1). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 18 of 30\nLaw understood it, was a multi-member, partisan-balanced board that did not exercise executive \npower.    Indeed, the cases in which the Court has upheld the constitutionality of removal protections \ninvolved multimember boards that are easily distinguishable from the MSPB: an agency whose officers \nthe Court understood to “occup[y] no place in the executive department and who exercise[] no part \nof the executive power,” Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628; a purely “adjudicatory body” that the \nCourt understood to fall outside the “Executive establishment,” Wiener, 357 U.S. at 353–56; and a \ncommission that was part of the Judicial Branch and exercised power that never belonged to the \nExecutive Branch, see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 385, 395 (1989).  \nWhile the unconstitutionality of the MSPB’s structure might be even more obvious if the \nagency had a single head, see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224; Collins, 594 U.S. at 226–28, the fact it has \nmultiple heads does not render it constitutional.  As previously explained, the MSPB is an executive \nagency exercising executive authority and therefore falls outside the Humphrey’s Executor exception for \nmultimember boards that do “not exercise any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.  For the \nsame reason, it does not change the constitutional analysis that MSPB members serve staggered terms, \nthat the President retains the authority to appoint the chairperson,5 and that the MSPB is subject to \nthe  appropriations  process,  Pl’s  Mot.  at  19–20.    Alternative  means  of  accountability  cannot \ncompensate for the President’s inability to control the Board members through removal.  See Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 504 (noting “[b]road power” over the functions of the inferior officers at issue \nthere “is not equivalent to the power to remove Board members”).      \n3.  Furthermore, confirming the government’s reading of Humphrey’s Executor would not \n“[u]pend” constitutional law, see Pl.’s Mot. at 20–23.  The legitimacy of the multimember boards \nPlaintiff cites (id. at 21) has been assumed to rest on Humphrey’s Executor.  But Humphrey’s Executor only \never approved the constitutionality of for-cause removal restrictions for multimember boards that do \nnot exercise executive power.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219 n.4 (recognizing that “what matters is the \n \n5 Plaintiff concedes that the President has the authority to remove her from her position as Chairman \nof the Board and correctly requests that the Court modify its TRO accordingly.  Pl.’s Mot. at 8 n.8 \n(citing 5 U.S.C. § 1203(a)).  The government joins in that request. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 19 of 30\nset of powers the Court considered as the basis for its decision, not any latent powers that the agency \nmay have had not alluded to by the Court”).  To be sure, the assumption on which Humphrey’s Executor \nrests—that the FTC at the time that case was decided did not exercise executive power—has since \nbeen “repudiated” by the Supreme Court.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 239 (Thomas, J., concurring in part); \nsee also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 689 n.28, 691 (retreating from Humphrey’s Executor’s “quasi-legislative” or \n“quasi-judicial” rationale, noting that “it is hard to dispute that the powers of the FTC at the time of \nHumphrey’s Executor would at the present time be considered ‘executive,’ at least to some degree”).  \nAnd, as the Supreme Court has recognized, the Humphrey’s Executor understanding of the 1935 FTC \nlikely cannot describe modern-day multimember boards.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216 n.2 (observing \nthat Humphrey’s Executor’s “conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive power has not \nwithstood the test of time”); see also Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 n.4 (2013) (noting that agencies \nmay engage in activities that “take ‘legislative’ and ‘judicial’ forms, but [those activities] are exercises \nof—indeed, under our constitutional structure they must be exercises of—the ‘executive Power’”).  But \nthat is all the more reason not to expansively read Humphrey’s Executor as blessing removal protections \nfor principal officers exercising executive powers that the Supreme Court did not consider when \ndeciding  that  case.    Indeed,  acknowledging  that  Humphrey’s  Executor  does  not  apply  beyond \nmultimember boards that do not exercise executive power would not “upend” constitutional law; \ninstead, it would acknowledge the limitations that the Supreme Court has said define Humphrey’s \nExecutor.   \nAdditionally, Plaintiff overstates the ramifications of adopting the government’s reading of \nHumphrey’s Executor.  In holding that the MSPB does not fall within the scope of the Humphrey’s Executor \nexception, this Court need not opine on whether all other so-called independent agencies would.  \nThere are good reasons to think that some agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, might be \nassessed differently.  See, e.g., Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 222 n.8 (suggesting that Federal Reserve might \nhave “special historical status” distinguishing it from other agencies, including the CFPB).  \nFinally, Plaintiff contends that a judicial order “overturn[ing] Humphrey’s Executor” would \n“radically upset the balance of power” because Congress might not have chosen to pass legislation \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 20 of 30\nestablishing boards and appropriating funds to hire federal employees if it had known certain tenure \nprotections were not permitted.  Pl.’s Mot. at 23.  Overturning Humphrey’s Executor is, of course, not \nan option available to this Court, see Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136, and so Plaintiff’s fear is misplaced.  In \nany event, speculation about different choices Congress may have made if it had legislated against a \ndifferent legal backdrop is no reason not to acknowledge what the Constitution demands.  Cf. Agostini \nv. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235 (1997) (noting the policy of stare decisis “is at its weakest when [courts] \ninterpret the Constitution”).   \nII.  Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to the Relief She Seeks. \nPlaintiff  asks  this  Court  to  declare  that  she  was  unlawfully  terminated  and  issue  the \nunprecedented relief of enjoining Defendants from removing her from office or treating her as \nremoved.  Compl., Prayer for Relief ¶¶ a.–d.  She is not entitled to either form of relief because this \nCourt lacks the authority to enter the injunction she requests; because she has failed to satisfy the \nfactors for injunctive relief, in any event; and because she has not established her entitlement to a \ndeclaratory judgment or writ of mandamus. \nA.  Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to Reinstatement.  \n1.a.  This Court lacks the power to issue any order reinstating a principal executive officer \nremoved  by  the  President.    The  Supreme  Court  recognized  long  ago  that  a  court  “has  no \njurisdiction . . . to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.” Mississippi v. Johnson, \n71 U.S. at 501. Awarding an injunction that would reinstate Plaintiff to the office from which the \nPresident has removed her inevitably restrains the President from exercising two core Article II \npowers: it prevents him from removing an officer that only he has the power to remove, and it \nprevents him from appointing an officer that only he has the power to appoint.  Such an injunction \nwould be an affront to the separation of powers.   \nAccordingly, when executive officers have challenged their removal by the President, they \nhave traditionally sought back pay, not reinstatement.  See Wiener, 357 U.S. at 350 (suit “for recovery \nof his salary”); Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (suit “to recover a sum of money alleged to be \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 21 of 30\ndue . . . for salary”); Myers, 272 U.S. at 106 (suit “for his salary from the date of his removal”); Shurtleff \nv. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 318 (1903) (suit “for salary”); Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, 326 \n(1897) (suit “for salary and fees”).6  That rule reflects the obvious Article II problems that arise if a \ncourt  attempts  to  reinstate—that  is,  reappoint—a  principal  executive  officer  removed  by  the \nPresident.  The President cannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal officer whom he \nno longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise of executive power. \nIndeed, many members of the First Congress argued against requiring the Senate’s advice and \nconsent for removals precisely because of the risk that such a procedure would require the President \nto retain someone he had sought to remove.  As Representative Benson observed: “If the Senate, \nupon its meeting, were to acquit the officer, and replace him in his station, the President would then \nhave a man forced on him whom he considered as unfaithful.”  Myers, 272 U.S. at 124 (citation \nomitted).  Representative Boudinot argued: “But suppose [the Senate] shall decide in favor of the \nofficer, what a situation is the President then in, surrounded by officers with whom, by his situation, \nhe is compelled to act, but in whom he can have no confidence.”  Id. at 131–32 (citation omitted).  \nAnd Representative Sedwick asked rhetorically:  “Shall a man under these circumstances be saddled \nupon the President, who has been appointed for no other purpose but to aid the President in \nperforming certain duties?  Shall he be continued, I ask again, against the will of the President?”  Id. \nat 132 (citation omitted).  The injunction Plaintiff seeks raises just this problem. \nb.  The injunction Plaintiff requests would also exceed the scope of this Court’s equitable \npowers.  A federal court may grant only those equitable remedies that were “traditionally accorded by \ncourts of equity.”  Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999).  \n \n6 Plaintiff may respond by arguing that the officers in Myers and Humphrey’s Executor had died.  But \nMyers and Humphrey were, of course, alive at the time of their removals, yet neither sought an \ninjunction restoring him to office.  Each waited, let back-pay claims accumulate, and eventually \nasserted those claims in court, directly or through an executor.  Myers was removed in February 1920, \nsued for back pay in April 1921, and was later succeeded by his administratrix.  Myers, 272 U.S. at 106, \n108.  And Humphrey’s executor sought salary due “from October 8, 1933, when the President \nundertook to remove him from office, to the time of his death on February 14, 1934.”  Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 612. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 22 of 30\nReinstatement of a public official is not such a remedy.  “It is . . . well settled that a court of equity \nhas no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers.”  In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, \n212 (1888).  Instead, “[t]he jurisdiction to determine the title to a public office belongs exclusively to \nthe courts of law,” for instance through suits for back pay.  Id.  Thus, “the power of a court of equity \nto restrain by injunction the removal of a [public] officer has been denied in many well-considered \ncases.”  Id.; see, e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962) (decisions that “held that federal equity \npower could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer” or that “withheld \nfederal equity from staying removal of a federal officer” reflect “a traditional limit upon equity \njurisdiction”); Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924) (“A court of equity has no \njurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers.”); Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, \n165 (1898) (“[T]o sustain a bill in equity to restrain . . . the removal of public officers, is to invade the \ndomain of the courts of common law, or of the executive and administrative department of the \ngovernment.”); White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (“[A] court of equity will not, by injunction, \nrestrain an executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain \nthe appointment of another.”).  As one 19th-century scholar wrote, “[n]o principle of the law of \ninjunctions, and perhaps no doctrine of equity jurisprudence, is more definitely fixed or more clearly \nestablished  than  that  courts  of  equity  will  not  interfere  by  injunction  to  determine  questions \nconcerning the appointment of public officers or their title to office.”  2 James L. High, Treatise on the \nLaw of Injunctions § 1312 (2d ed. 1880).   \n“Perhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with the [remedy] is \nthe lack of historical precedent for [it],” Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 505 (citation omitted), and there \nis no historical precedent for reinstatement.  At most, a district court in 1983 effectively reinstated \nremoved members of the multimember U.S. Commission on Civil Rights because that court believed \nthat the commission functioned as a “legislative agency” whose “only purpose” was “to find facts \nwhich [could] subsequently be used as a basis for legislative or executive action”—not to exercise any \nexecutive power in its own right.  Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-cv-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *2 (D.D.C. Nov. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 23 of 30\n14, 1983) (citations omitted), vacated, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  That is no support for Plaintiff’s \ninsistence that an agency head whom the President has fired must keep exercising Article II powers. \n2.a.  Plaintiff’s contrary contention that the government’s cases do not prevent the Court from \nentering an injunction against only subordinate officials, rather than the President, Pl.’s Mot. at 30–\n32, is unavailing.  The President is the “only official with the statutory and constitutional authority to \nappoint, remove, and supervise” agency heads.  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at \n*13 n.2 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting); see also U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2 (vesting \nauthority to appoint principal officers in President alone).  Therefore, any relief preventing Plaintiff’s \nremoval from the Board or ordering her reinstatement, Compl., Prayer for Relief ¶¶ c–d—what \nPlaintiff seeks here— “necessarily targets the President,” Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *13 n.2 \n(Katsas, J., dissenting), and would prevent him from exercising his lawful Article II authority to select \nMembers of his choosing.  Whether the order is expressly directed at the President or not, Supreme \nCourt precedents reinforce that courts lack power to issue any order reinstating a principal executive \nofficer removed by the President.  \nD.C. Circuit precedent does not compel a different result.  Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 \nF.3d 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1996), to which Plaintiff cites, determined only that plaintiffs could obtain judicial \nreview of an executive order, not that the court could issue an injunction directing the President’s \nexercise of his appointment and removal authority.  Id. at 1328.  Likewise, in Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d \n973 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the D.C. Circuit held only that the plaintiff, a former member of the National \nCredit Union Administration who had been removed by President Clinton, had standing to challenge \nhis removal because his injury could be redressed by the actions of subordinate officials.  Id. at 978–\n81; see also id. at 980–81 (“[W]e hold that the partial relief Swan can obtain against subordinate executive \nofficials is sufficient for redressability, even recognizing that the President has the power, if he so \nchose, to undercut this relief.”).  Standing is not at issue in this case, and Swan expressly declined to \ndecide whether courts have the authority to order reinstatement as a remedy, noting that it was not \n“determining whether we can order more complete relief[.]”  Id. at 981.  For the reasons stated, a court \ncannot do so. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 24 of 30\nb.  Plaintiff next objects that the government’s arguments regarding the unavailability of \ninjunctive relief conflate the merits and remedial analysis.  Pl.’s Mot. at 32–33.  But those analyses are \nintertwined.  If the government is correct on the merits, the relief Plaintiff seeks is an injunction \nproviding for her reinstatement since she has been validly removed.  And even if what she seeks is an \ninjunction preventing her removal, the Supreme Court’s precedents foreclose that relief too.  See, e.g., \nWhite, 171 U.S. at 377 (“[A] court of equity will not, by injunction, restrain an executive officer from \nmaking a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain the appointment of another.”).  \nc.  Additionally, Plaintiff asks this Court to disregard the Supreme Court’s statement in White \nthat “a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers,” 171 \nU.S. at 377.  Pl.’s Mot. at 33–35.  That argument fails for several reasons.  First, White is binding \nprecedent until the Supreme Court itself determines to overturn it, “even if the lower court thinks the \nprecedent is in tension with ‘some other line of decisions.’”  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 (quoting Rodriguez \nde Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989)).7  Second, the case Plaintiff claims \ncalls White into question is distinguishable: Sampson involved an employee, not an officer.  415 U.S. at \n62.  Third, the fact that law and equity have merged since White, Pl.’s Mot. at 33, is of no moment.  \nThe Supreme Court has made clear that the scope of a court’s equitable powers is determined by the \nscope of equity jurisdiction at the Founding, regardless of the later merger of law and equity.  See Grupo \nMexicano, 527 U.S. at 318–19; see also Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, \n212 (2002) (looking back to “days of the divided bench” to determine availability of equitable relief).  \nIndeed, in Baker, the Supreme Court reiterated the principle that courts may not enjoin removals of \nfederal officers after the law-equity merger.  See Baker, 369 U.S. at 231.    \nd.  Finally, the government is not asking this Court to establish a “backpay-only rule.”  Pl.’s \nMot. at 35.  Instead, it invokes backpay for two purposes.  First, as explained below, the potential \navailability of backpay is one reason Plaintiff’s claimed harm is not irreparable.  See infra pp. 18-19.  \n \n7 Plaintiff’s request that the Court disregard White because it has (in her view) been called into question \nby later cases stands in conflict with her assertion that later cases questioning the rationale of \nHumphrey’s Executor have no bearing on that case’s continued validity.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11–26.  She \ncannot have it both ways.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 25 of 30\nSecond, the fact that executive officers removed from their posts have typically sought backpay, rather \nthan reinstatement, reflects the fact that this court lacks the authority to enter the injunctive relief \nPlaintiff seeks here.    \nB.  Plaintiff Has Not Satisfied the Injunction Factors.  \nTo establish her entitlement to a permanent injunction, Plaintiff must demonstrate: “‘(1) that \n[she] has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, \nare inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between \nthe plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not \nbe disserved by a permanent injunction.’”  Anatol Zukerman & Charles Krause Reporting, LLC v. U.S. \nPostal Serv., 64 F.4th 1354, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. \n388, 391 (2006)).  “When the defendant is the government, factors (3) and (4) merge.”  Id. (citing Nken \nv. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  Plaintiff has not satisfied any of these factors.8 \n1.  Plaintiff has not suffered an irreparable injury.  \nPlaintiff can show neither that her injury is irreparable nor that monetary relief such as backpay \nare inadequate compensation for any injury.  Plaintiff’s claimed injury is the “depriv[ation] . . . of the \nability to do what Congress specifically directed.”  Pl.’s Mot. at 28.  That claim does not meet the “high \nstandard for irreparable injury,” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. \nCir. 2006)—a standard that is particularly rigorous in cases involving the government, given that the \n“[g]overnment has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the dispatch of its own internal \naffairs.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (citation omitted).   \na.  The harm Plaintiff claims amounts to a loss of position.  Although Plaintiff’s removal \ndeprives her of her employment and salary, such consequences ordinarily do not amount to irreparable \n \n8 Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the factors for a preliminary injunction for the same reasons, and \nbecause, for the reasons described in Part I, she is not likely to prevail on the merits.  See Winter, 555 \nU.S. at 20 (requiring movant for preliminary-injunction to establish “that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance \nof equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”); accord Sherley, 644 F.3d at \n392.     \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 26 of 30\ninjury, “however severely they may affect a particular individual.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68.  To \nthe contrary, numerous courts in this circuit and others have held that loss of employment is not \nirreparable injury—in part because it can be remediated through back pay and other equitable \nremedies.  See, e.g., Hetreed v. Allstate Ins. Co., 135 F.3d 1155, 1158 (7th Cir. 1998); Davis v. Billington, 76 \nF. Supp. 3d 59, 65-66 (D.D.C. 2014) (collecting cases); Farris v. Rice, 453 F. Supp. 2d 76, 79-80 (D.D.C. \n2006) (noting that “cases are legion holding that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable \ninjury” given “court’s equitable powers to remedy for loss in employment through, for example, back \npay”); see also Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *17 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  Accordingly, when principal \nofficers have been removed from their posts, they generally have challenged that removal in suits for \nback pay.  See Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (challenge sought “to recover a sum of money \nalleged to be due”); Myers, 272 U.S. at 106 (same); Wiener, 357 U.S. at 349-51 (same).  \nPlaintiff contends that her alleged harm is more than just loss of position because her “‘loss \nof the ability’ to perform her congressionally directed, presidentially appointed, and Senate confirmed \nmission transcends the ‘loss of income’ or ‘embarrassment’ involved in the typical employment \naction.”  Pl.’s Mot. at 29 (quoting Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at *10-11 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 12, 2025)).  But the Supreme Court has already rejected that reasoning too.  Although a public \nofficial’s “loss of salary” amounts to a judicially cognizable harm, his “loss of political power” does \nnot.  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820 (1997).  The notion that public officials “have a separate private \nright, akin to a property interest, in the powers of their offices” is “alien to the concept of a republican \nform of government.”  Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Bork, J., dissenting).   \nb.  Plaintiff additionally contends that removing her from the Board will “cause irreparable \nharm to the Board itself” because it would threaten the Board’s independence and deprive Plaintiff of \nher “statutory right to function.”  Pl.’s Mot. at 28–29.  First, as discussed above, the Board’s claimed \nindependence contravenes Article II’s requirement that the President be able to supervise and thus \nremove those aiding in the execution of his duties.  See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 496–97.  \nFurthermore, this case is unlike Berry v. Reagan, 1983 WL 538 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated, 732 F.2d \n949 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which Plaintiff cites in support of her claim that denial of an injunction would \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 27 of 30\nirreparably harm the Board, Pl.’s Mot. at 28.  In Berry, President Reagan removed several members of \nthe Commission on Civil Rights, an action that prevented the Commission from completing a report \nit was statutorily required to complete by a date certain.  1983 WL 538, at *1, *5.  This “obviously \ndisruptive effect” on the functioning of the Commission was irreparable because it would prevent the \nCommission from ever completing its statutory mandate, given that the Commission was set to expire.  \nId. at *5.  Plaintiff and the MSPB are differently situated; the MSPB will not cease to exist and, indeed, \ncan continue to function.  See Jolley v. MSPB, 636 F. App’x 567, 570 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing 5 C.F.R. \n§ 1200.3(b)).9    \nTo the extent the harm Plaintiff asserts is harm to the MSPB, see Pl.’s Mot. at 28–29, that fails \nas well.  First, as explained above, denying her relief would not deprive the MSPB of the inability to \nfulfill its mandate.  And second, that argument is merely a repackaging of Plaintiff’s contention that \nshe is the best person for the position and that the President had no sound reason for removing her—\ni.e., that a Board with Plaintiff as a member would better serve the agency’s mission than one without \nher.  That is the President’s prerogative to determine.  \n2.  The balance of the equities and public interest weigh strongly in favor \nof the government. \nThe balance of the equities and public interest weigh strongly against Plaintiff’s reinstatement \nas a member of the MSPB.  Because the MSPB is an executive agency exercising executive authority, \nan injunction functionally reinstating one of its principal officers would raise grave separation-of-\npowers concerns and work a great and irreparable harm to the Executive.  The President cannot be \ncompelled to retain the services of a principal officer whom the President no longer believes should \nbe entrusted with the exercise of executive power.  Such a remedy would undermine the accountability \n \n9 Plaintiff notes that Board Member Raymond Limon’s term expires on March 1, 2025.  Even if the \nMSPB operates without a quorum for some period, Berry would still be distinguishable.  In Berry, the \nharm was irreparable in part because the commission was set to expire.  1983 WL 538, at *5.  But here, \nthe MSPB will not cease to exist and could resume its full functioning upon the resumption of a \nquorum.  Furthermore, MSPB promulgated a rule in 2024 that expanded the functions that the MSPB \ncan perform without a quorum.  See 5 C.F.R. § 1200.3; Interim Final Rule, Organization and \nProcedures, 89 Fed. Reg. 72,957, 72,957-58 (Sept. 9, 2024). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 28 of 30\nof the Executive Branch instilled by the Constitution.  The President “is elected by the entire Nation” \nand all executive officers “remain[] subject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected \nPresident.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  Adding further carveouts from that constitutional rule—and \nthen reinstating principal officers pursuant to those further carveouts—“heightens the concern that” \nthe Executive Branch “may slip from the Executive’s control, and thus from that of the people.”  Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. \nMoreover, the public interest is better served by an MSPB member who holds the President’s \nconfidence and, accordingly, will more effectively serve him in executing his duties as Chief Executive.  \n“[T]he Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the ‘dispatch of its own \ninternal affairs.’”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (quoting Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, \nA.F.L.-C.I.O. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 896 (1961)).  It is especially important that the President be \ngranted such latitude to oversee the MSPB, which performs a critical role in managing the Executive \nBranch’s own workforce.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204.  “Allowing another branch of government to \ninsulate executive officers from presidential control . . . would sever a key constitutional link between \nthe People and their government,” contrary to the public interest.  Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *17 \n(Katsas, J., dissenting).  The American people elected President Trump to run the executive branch.  \nAnd President Trump has determined that keeping Plaintiff in office no longer serves the best interests \nof the American people.  That democratically accountable choice should be respected.   \nConversely, the public interest would not be served by reinstating Plaintiff.  The only argument \nPlaintiff offers in favor of her equities is that the government has no interest in flouting the laws.  Pl.’s \nMot. at 29–30.  But that argument presupposes the success of her incorrect merits arguments.  \nC.  Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to Declaratory Judgment or Mandamus Relief. \n1.  For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff is incorrect on the merits and thus not entitled \nto declaratory judgment.  Furthermore, the same principles that foreclose reinstatement likewise \nforeclose declaratory relief.  A court “cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President.” \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 29 of 30\njudgment).  And a declaratory-judgment suit is “essentially an equitable cause of action.”  Samuels v. \nMackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70 (1971) (citation omitted).  “[T]he Declaratory Judgment Act provides that \nafter a declaratory judgment is issued the district court may enforce it by granting ‘further necessary \nor proper relief,’ 28 U.S.C. § 2202, and therefore a declaratory judgment . . . might serve as the basis \nfor a subsequent injunction.”  Samuels, 401 U.S. at 72.  “[E]ven if the declaratory judgment is not used \nas a basis for actually issuing an injunction, the declaratory relief alone has virtually the same practical \nimpact as a formal injunction would.”  Id.  As a result, “the same equitable principles relevant to the \npropriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining \nwhether to issue a declaratory judgment.”  Id. at 73.  To be sure, there may be “unusual circumstances” \nwhere  “a  declaratory  judgment might be  appropriate”  even  though  “an  injunction  [would]  be \nwithheld.”  Id.  But “ordinarily,” “where an injunction would be impermissible,” “declaratory relief \nshould . . . be denied as well.”  Id. at 73; see Macauley v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 327 U.S. 540, 545 n.4 (1946) \n(“The same principles which justified dismissal of the cause insofar as it sought injunction justified \ndenial of the prayer for a declaratory judgment.”); Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. \n293, 300 (1943) (noting that the Declaratory Judgment Act “only provided a new form of procedure \nfor the adjudication of rights in conformity” with “established equitable principles.”). \n2.  Plaintiff is also not entitled to a writ of mandamus.  The writ of mandamus “is intended to \nprovide a remedy for a plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the \ndefendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.”  Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616 (1984).  \nMandamus  is  “inappropriate  except  where  a  public  official  has  violated  a  ‘ministerial’  duty.” \nConsolidated Edison Co. v. Ashcroft, 286 F.3d 600, 606 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Plaintiff has not established that \nthe President owes her a “clear nondiscretionary duty” and the President’s selection of who should \nlead an Executive Branch agency is certainly not a mere ministerial task. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons above, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nand Judgment on the Merits. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 33     Filed 02/28/25     Page 30 of 30\n \nDated: February 28, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              YAAKOV M.

Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nDaniel J. Reidy \nDeputy Clerk\nPage 2\n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 3 of 114\n \nWALKER, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nArticle II of the Constitution vests the “executive Power” \nin “a President of the United States” and requires him to “take \nCare  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully  executed.”1    “To  protect \nindividual  liberty,  the  Framers . . . created  a  President \nindependent  from  the  Legislative  Branch.”2    “To  further \nsafeguard liberty, the Framers insisted upon accountability for \nthe  exercise  of  executive  power,”  so  they  “lodged  full \nresponsibility for the executive power in a President of the \nUnited  States,  who  is  elected  by  and  accountable  to  the \npeople.”3   \nExecutive branch agencies do not disrupt that design when \nthey are accountable to the President.  “But consent of the \ngoverned is a sham if an administrative agency, by design, does \nnot meaningfully answer for its policies to either of the elected \nbranches.”4    That’s  why  the  Supreme  Court  has  said  that \nCongress cannot restrict the President’s removal authority over \nagencies that “wield substantial executive power.”5 \nThat Court’s precedents control this court’s case.  Under \nthose  precedents,  the  Government  is  likely  to  succeed  in \nshowing that the statutory removal protections for National \nLabor  Relations  Board  commissioners  and  Merit  Systems \nProtection  Board  members  are  unconstitutional.    The \nGovernment has also shown that it will suffer irreparable harm \neach day the President is deprived of the ability to control the \nexecutive branch.  Conversely, the removed officials suffer no \n \n1 U.S. Const., art. II, §§ 1, 3. \n2 Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 537 F.3d 667, 689 (D.C. Cir. \n2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). \n3 PHH Corp. v.

Finally, the public interest also \nsupports a stay.  The people elected the President to enforce the \nnation’s laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the \npeople’s chosen officer to control the executive branch. \nI therefore support granting the motions for a stay pending \nappeal in Harris v. Bessent (25-5055) and Wilcox v. Trump (25-\n5057). \nI. Background \nThe  National  Labor  Relations  Board  and  the  Merit \nSystems Protection Board are executive branch agencies.  By \nthe  terms  of  statutes  that  the  Government  argues  are \nunconstitutional,  their  members  may  be  removed  only  for \ncause.6   \nOn January 27, 2025, President Donald Trump removed \nGwynne Wilcox from the NLRB prior to her term’s expiration \nin  2028.    In  an  explanatory  letter,  the  President  informed \nWilcox that the NLRB had not “been operating in a manner \nconsistent with the objectives of [his] administration.”7  Citing \nseveral  recent  Board  decisions,  he  expressed  concern  that \nWilcox was “unduly disfavoring the interests of employers.”8 \nWilcox sued for reinstatement on February 5, 2025.  Five \ndays later, she moved for summary judgment on an expedited \nbasis.  After a hearing on March 5, the district court granted \n \n6 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) (MSPB); 29 U.S.C § 153(a) (NLRB). \n7 Pl.’s Ex. A at 2, Wilcox v. Trump, No. 25-cv-334 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, \n2025), ECF No. 10-4. \n8 Id. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 5 of 114\n3 \nsummary judgment to Wilcox, declaring that she remained a \nmember of the NLRB and permanently enjoining the NLRB’s \nChair and his subordinates from effectuating the President’s \nremoval order. \nA similar chain of events occurred in Harris v. Bessent.  \nOn February 10, 2025, the President removed Cathy Harris \nfrom the MSPB prior to her term’s expiration in 2028.  Unlike \nWilcox, Harris did not receive an explanatory letter.  \nHarris sued for reinstatement on February 11, 2025.  Seven \ndays later, the district court granted her request for a temporary \nrestraining order, effectively reinstating her to the MSPB.  A \nfew  weeks later, the  court granted summary judgment  for \nHarris, declaring that she remained a member of the MSPB and \npermanently  enjoining  various  government  officials  from \nexecuting the President’s removal order. \nIn  defending  these  removals,  the  Government  has  not \nargued that the President met the statutory criteria for removal.9  \nInstead,  it  has  insisted  that  those  provisions  are \nunconstitutional infringements on the President’s Article II \nremoval power — a position consistent with the President’s \nrecent executive order regarding independent agencies.10 \n \n9 See 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) (removal “only for inefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office”); 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (removal only \n“upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in \noffice, but for no other cause”). \n10 Exec. Order No. 14,215, Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies \n(Feb. 18, 2025), https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-03063. \nThe Government also maintains that federal district courts lack \nthe equitable power to reinstate an officer who has been removed by \nthe President.  Because this court grants the Government’s stay \napplication on alternative grounds, I have no occasion to address this \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 6 of 114\n4 \nOn that basis, the Government appealed both orders and \nmoved for emergency stays pending appeal.  We considered \nthe two motions together and heard oral argument on March \n18, 2025. \nII. The Presidential Removal Power \n  Before addressing the stay factors, it is prudent to address \nthe text, history, and precedents that control this preliminary \nmerits determination. \nA.  History \nI begin with a review of our nation’s founding period, the \ncreation of our Constitution, and the historical practice in the \ndecades that followed. \n1.  The Energetic Executive \nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the early Republic \nexperienced the perils of having a weak executive.  With “no \nexecutive separate from Congress,”11 the federal government \nhad to rely on the states’ good graces to carry out national \npolicies.12    And  it  was  powerless  to  respond  to  national \n \nargument.  Cf. Bessent v. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 517 (2025) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (observing that “by the 1880s [the Supreme] \nCourt considered  it ‘well settled that a  court of equity has no \njurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers’” \n(quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888))); Dellinger v. \nBessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *14 (D.C.

They  recognized  that  “structural \nprotections” — most  significantly,  the  separation  of \npowers — “were critical to preserving liberty.”16  By splitting \nthe legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and “giving to \nthose  who  administer  each  department  the  necessary \nconstitutional  means  and  personal  motives  to  resist \nencroachments of the others,” the federal government could \navoid the “gradual concentration of the several powers in the \nsame department.”17 \nAfter their experience with parliamentary supremacy, the \nFramers were particularly concerned about the concentration \nof  legislative  power.18    For  example,  Gouverneur  Morris \nwarned delegates at the Constitutional Convention that the \n“Legislature will continually seek to aggrandize & perpetuate \n \n13 Max Farrand, The Fathers of the Constitution 95 (1921). \n14 Letter from Henry Knox to George Washington (March 19, 1787), \nhttps://perma.cc/9UCC-ZYAP. \n15 PennEast Pipeline Co. v.

They  were  concerned  that  “the \nweakness of the executive may require . . . that it should be \nfortified.”21  After the “humiliating weakness” of the Articles \nof Confederation, the “Framers deemed an energetic executive \nessential to ‘the protection of the community against foreign \nattacks,’ ‘the steady administration of the laws,’ ‘the protection \nof property,’ and ‘the security of liberty.’”22   \nThe Framers debated how to achieve that objective while \nalso avoiding the dangers of monarchy or tyranny.  Some \ndelegates proposed a plural executive to limit the concentration \nof power in any one person.  For example, Edmund Randolph \npressed for a three-member executive representing different \n \n19 James Madison’s Notes of the Constitutional Convention (July 19, \n1787), https://perma.cc/HU54-J7SU. \n20 Seila Law LLC v.

Original Understanding of the Removal Power \nAgainst that backdrop, the Constitution assigns a lofty role \nto the President.  Article II vests the “executive Power” in the \n“President of the United States of America.”31  And it charges \nthe  President  to  “take  Care  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully \nexecuted.”32   \nOf course, the President cannot carry out his duties “alone \nand  unaided” — he  must  enlist  the  “assistance  of \nsubordinates.”33    The  Framers  envisioned  a  “chain  of \ndependence”  in  the  executive  branch,  where  “the  lowest \nofficers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as they \nought, on the President.”34  The Vesting Clause empowers the \nPresident  to  direct  and  control  those  officials.    As  James \nMadison explained, “if any power whatsoever is in its nature \nexecutive,  it  is  the  power  of  appointing,  overseeing,  and \ncontrolling those who execute the laws.”35   \n \n29 Id. \n30 Id. \n31 U.S. Const. art.

The \nFirst Congress encountered the question directly, and its debate \nand decision — now called “the Decision of 1789” — provides \n“contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s \nmeaning since many of the Members of the First Congress had \ntaken part in framing that instrument.”38 \nDuring the summer of 1789 “ensued what has been many \ntimes described as one of the ablest constitutional debates \nwhich has taken place.”39  The topic of the President’s removal \npower came up “during consideration of a bill establishing \ncertain Executive Branch offices and providing that the officers \n \n36 Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 492 (quoting Letter from James \nMadison to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), in 16 Documentary \nHistory of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004)). \n37 Id.

Historical Practice \nThe understanding that the President holds unrestricted \nremoval power “became widely accepted during the first 60 \nyears of the Nation.”45  George Washington removed “almost \ntwenty officers, including a consul, diplomats, tax collectors, \nsurveyors,  and  military  officers.”46    What’s  more,  his \ncommissions typically stated that officeholders served during \n“the  pleasure  of  the  President,”  indicating  Washington’s \napparent belief that he could dismiss officers at will.47  Then-\nSecretary of State Timothy Pickering — the official in charge \nof  signing  commissions — confirmed  the  meaning  of  that \nlanguage: “In all cases except that of the Judges, it has been \nestablished from the time of organizing the Government, that \n \nsusceptible to multiple interpretations, I follow the Supreme Court’s.  \nSee Myers, 272 U.S. at 114; Parsons, 167 U.S. at 328-30; Bowsher, \n478 U.S. at 723; Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 492; Seila Law, \n140 S.

After \nrecounting  the  Decision  of  1789  and  the  “continued  and \nuninterrupted practice” of plenary presidential removal, the \nCourt construed Parsons’ four-year term as a ceiling for how \nlong he could remain in office — not as a restriction on the \nPresident’s power to remove him sooner.67 \nAs this history demonstrates, the Founders understood that \nthe President had inherent, inviolable, and unlimited authority \nto remove principal officers exercising substantial executive \nauthority, and Presidents have exercised that authority since the \nvery  beginning  of  the  Republic,  beginning  with  George \nWashington. \nB.  Precedent \nWith those historical underpinnings, I turn to the Supreme \nCourt’s more recent precedents.  The Court has reaffirmed the \nPresident’s  inherent  removal  power  on  several  occasions, \n \n63 Free Enterprise Fund, 537 F.3d at 692 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). \n64 Id. at 692-93. \n65 Parsons, 167 U.S. at 327-28. \n66 Id. at 328. \n67 Id. at 338-39, 340. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 17 of 114\n15 \nrelying  often  on  the  historical  evidence  recounted  in  the \npreceding section.   \nThat is not to say the Court’s removal-power jurisprudence \nhas  always  been  consistent.    Though  the  Court  in  Myers \nreaffirmed  the  President’s  unilateral  removal  power, \nHumphrey’s Executor created an exception to the rule.  It left \nfuture courts to decide when that exception might apply.  To \nthe extent that Humphrey’s created a showdown between the \nMyers rule and the Humphrey’s exception, the Court’s recent \ndecisions have been unequivocal: Humphrey’s has few, if any, \napplications today.  To discern the Supreme Court’s rule, I \nreview the Court’s holdings, beginning with Myers. \n1.  Myers \nIn 1920, President Woodrow Wilson removed postmaster \nFrank Myers from office.68  Myers sought backpay, relying on \na statute that required the President to obtain Senate approval \nbefore  removing  him — something  the  President  had \nindisputably not done.69  The question before the Court was \nwhether the Constitution permitted such a restriction. \nWriting for the Court, Chief Justice Taft undertook a deep \nhistorical  survey,  concluding  that  the  statutory  provision \ndenying the President the “unrestricted power of removal” was \n“in violation of the Constitution and invalid.”70  That survey \nhighlighted much of the history recounted above, including the \nDecision of 1789.  The Court focused on four points advanced \n \n68 Myers, 272 U.S. at 106. \n69 Id. at 107-08. \n70 Id. at 176. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 18 of 114\n16 \nby James Madison and his allies during that congressional \ndebate. \nFirst,  Myers  stressed  that  the  President’s  supervisory \npower over officers is crucial for protecting the separation of \npowers: “If there is any point in which the separation of the \nlegislative and executive powers ought to be maintained with \ngreat caution, it is that which relates to officers and offices.”71  \nIt further explained that to “take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted,” the President must be able to “select those who were \nto act for him under his direction” and remove “those for whom \nhe  cannot  continue  to  be  responsible.”72    The  Court’s \nconclusion: “[N]o express limit was placed on the power of \nremoval by the executive” and “none was intended.”73 \nSecond, the Court considered whether the Senate’s role in \npresidential appointments carried with it a corresponding role \nin removals.  It concluded that history would not support that \ninference.  The power of removal “is different in its nature from \nthat  of  appointment,”  as  was  “pointed  out”  in  the  First \nCongress’s debate.74  That’s because a Senate veto of a removal \n“is a much greater limitation upon the executive branch, and a \nmuch  more  serious  blending  of  the  legislative  with  the \nexecutive, than a rejection of a proposed appointment.”75  So \nwhere the Constitution does not directly provide Congress any \npower over removals, that power “is not to be implied.”76 \n \n71 Id. (quoting 1 Annals of Congress 581 (1789) (James Madison)). \n72 Id. at 117, 122. \n73 Myers, 272 U.S. at 118. \n74 Id. at 121. \n75 Id. \n76 Id. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 19 of 114\n17 \nThird, the Court observed that Congress’s power to create \noffices  did  not  carry  a  corresponding  power  to  limit  the \nPresident’s removal power over them.  The “legislative power” \nis “limited to” the powers “enumerated” under Article I of the \nConstitution;  the  “executive  power”  is  a  “more  general \ngrant.”77  Thus, the Court found it “reasonable to suppose” that \nif the Founders “intended to give to Congress power to regulate \nor control removals,” they would have included those powers \n“among  the  specifically  enumerated  legislative  powers  in \narticle 1, or in the specified limitations on the executive power \nin article 2.”78 \nFourth and finally, the Court noted the threat that Congress \ncould  “thwart[] the  executive in  the exercise  of his  great \npowers  and  in  the  bearing  of  his  great  responsibility  by \nfastening upon him . . . men who” might render his faithful \nexecution of the laws “difficult or impossible” — be it “by \ntheir inefficient service under him, by their lack of loyalty to \nthe service, or by their different views of policy.”79  To avoid \nthis  possibility,  the  moment  that  the  President  “loses \nconfidence in the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of \nany one of [his subordinates], he must have the power to \nremove him without delay.”80 \nThe Court specifically included within that authority the \npower to remove executive officers whose duties include those \n“of a quasi judicial character.”81  Though the Court noted that \n“the President cannot . . . properly influence or control” the \ndischarge of such duties, he may still “consider the decision \n \n77 Id. at 128. \n78 Myers, 272 U.S. at 128. \n79 Id. at 131. \n80 Id. at 134. \n81 Id. at 135. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 20 of 114\n18 \nafter its rendition as a reason for removing the officer. . . . \nOtherwise he does not discharge his own constitutional duty of \nseeing that the laws be faithfully executed.”82 \nMyers was a landmark decision.  It established that the \nPresident’s removal power is grounded in the Constitution’s \ntext and history and bolstered by tradition.  It is essential to the \nconstitutional  separation  of  powers  and  to  the  President’s \nability to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”83   \n2.  Humphrey’s Executor  \nThen came Humphrey’s Executor.84  It reaffirmed the core \nholding of Myers — that the President holds an “illimitable \npower of removal” over “purely executive officers.”85  But “in \nsix quick pages devoid of textual or historical precedent for the \nnovel  principle  it  set  forth,”86  Humphrey’s  carved  out  an \nexception for agencies that wield “no part of the executive \npower.”87 \nAccording to the Court, that exception permitted Congress \nto insulate officers of the relevant agency, the Federal Trade \nCommission, from at-will removal.  That exception rested on \nthe  Court’s  characterization  of  the  FTC  as  an  entity  that \nexercised “no part of the executive power” and that in no way \nacted as “an arm or an eye of the executive.”88  Instead, the \n \n82 Id. \n83 U.S. Const. art.

The Court has consistently declined to extend \nHumphrey’s beyond its facts and has instead reaffirmed Myers \nas the default rule that occupies the “field of doubt” for any \nagency  that  wields  the  substantial  executive  power  that \nHumphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC not to exercise. \n3.  Wiener \nOne might say Humphrey’s had “one good year” in 1958, \nwhen the Court applied it in Wiener v. United States.94  There, \nthe Court “read a removal restriction into the War Claims Act \nof  1948”  because  the  War  Claims  Commission  “was  an \nadjudicatory body.”95 \nThe Wiener opinion took for granted that the Commission \nwas purely an adjudicatory body.  Indeed, the Commission’s \nentire  responsibility,  in  the  Court’s  view,  consisted  of \n“receiv[ing]  and  adjudicat[ing] . . . three  classes  of  claims” \ndefined  by  statute.96    Nothing  more.    So  in  Wiener,  the \nHumphrey’s  exception  continued  unchanged:  Officers  of \nagencies that do not exercise executive power may be insulated \nfrom presidential removal. \n \n94 357 U.S. 349 (1958); cf.

Free Enterprise Fund \nThe  Court  declined  to  extend  Humphrey’s  in  Free \nEnterprise Fund v. PCAOB.97  That case involved a challenge \nto the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s double-\nlayer removal protections — its members were removable only \nfor cause by SEC commissioners who in turn were removable \nonly for cause.98  \nReversing a panel decision of this court, the Supreme \nCourt  rejected  the  Board’s  structure  as  a  violation  of  the \nVesting Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Constitution’s \nseparation  of  powers.99   Multi-layered  removal  protections \nrendered the President helpless to “oversee the faithfulness of \nthe officers who execute” the law.100  If an inferior officer \nperformed poorly, the President could not remove him; nor \ncould the President remove the poor performer’s supervisor for \nfailing to carry out the desired removal.101  As a result, the \nPresident  had  no  way  to  hold  officers  accountable  in  the \nexecutive branch. \nAccording to Free Enterprise Fund, the Founders created \na unitary executive in part to ensure political accountability to \nthe people.  Because citizens “do not vote for the ‘Officers of \nthe United States,’” they must instead “look to the President to \nguide  the  ‘assistants  or  deputies  . . .  subject  to  his \n \n97 561 U.S. 477 (2010). \n98 Id. at 487. \n99 Id. at 484, 492. \n100 Id. at 484. \n101 Id. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 24 of 114\n22 \nsuperintendence.”102  Without this “clear and effective chain of \ncommand,” voters cannot identify “on whom the blame or the \npunishment” should fall when the government errs.103   \nThe Court stressed that its decision did not constrain the \nsize  of  the  executive  branch  but  instead  safeguarded  its \naccountability.  The larger and more complex the executive \nbranch becomes, the greater the risk that it will “slip from the \nExecutive’s control, and thus from that of the people.”104  As \nthe executive branch expands — wielding “vast power and \ntouch[ing]  almost  every  aspect  of  daily  life” — its \naccountability to a democratically elected President is even \nmore essential.105   \nWhere did Free Enterprise Fund leave Myers?  It called \nMyers a “landmark.”106  And it reaffirmed Myers’ “principle \nthat  Article  II  confers  on  the  President  ‘the  general \nadministrative control of those executing the laws,’” including \nthe removal power.107   \nAnd Humphrey’s?

Seila Law \nThe Court again declined to extend Humphrey’s in Seila \nLaw  LLC  v. CFPB.111    That  case  presented  another  “new \nsituation”: “an independent agency,” the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, “led by a single Director and vested with \nsignificant executive power.”112   \nAs in Free Enterprise Fund, the Supreme Court repudiated \na decision of this court.113  And as in Free Enterprise Fund, the \nSupreme Court took the President’s absolute removal power as \nexpressed in Myers as “the rule,” with Humphrey’s as a limited \nexception.114  The Court explained that Humphrey’s represents \n“the  outermost  constitutional  limits  of  permissible \ncongressional restrictions on the President’s removal power,” \n \n109 PHH Corp. v.

Collins \nCollins v. Yellen applied Seila Law’s holding to another \nindependent agency led by a single top officer — the Federal \nHousing Finance Authority.117  In doing so, the Court doubled \ndown  on  its  prior  reasoning  and  has  been  understood  by \nsome — including Justice Kagan — to have gone even further \nthan Seila Law in affirming the Myers default rule.118   \nFirst, the Court rejected the argument that FHFA’s more \nlimited authority justified its removal protection.119  Instead, \nthe Court reaffirmed the President’s removal power as serving \n“vital purposes” regardless of an agency’s scope or power.120   \n \n115 Id. at 2200 (quoting PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 196 (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting)) (emphasis added). \n116 Id. at 2200-01. \n117 See 141 S.

The State of the Doctrine Today \nText, history, and precedent are clear: The Constitution \nvests the “entire ‘executive Power’” in the President.129  That \npower “includes the ability to remove executive officials.”130  \nWithout  such  power,  it  would  be  “impossible  for  the \nPresident . . . to  take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully \nexecuted.”131 \nThe Supreme Court has “left in place two exceptions to the \nPresident’s unrestricted removal power.”132  Each of them is \nbinding on lower  courts, even if each of them  is  also  on \njurisprudential  life  support.    One  of  them — Morrison  v. \nOlson — is not relevant here.133   \nThe second exception is Humphrey’s.  It allows Congress \nto restrict the President’s removal power for “a multimember \nbody of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that perform[s] \nlegislative and judicial functions” and exercises “no part of the \n \n128 Id. at 1787 (quoting Seila Law, 140 S.

The \ndefault: Executive agencies exercise executive power.  The \nexception covers only an agency materially indistinguishable \nfrom the 1935 FTC, as Humphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC.   \nWhy  did  the  Supreme  Court  narrow  Humphrey’s  so \nseverely in Seila Law and Collins?   \nPerhaps  it  was  because  Humphrey’s  “authorize[s]  a \nsignificant intrusion on the President’s Article II authority to \nexercise the executive power and take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.”136 \nOr perhaps it was because Humphrey’s “did not pause to \nexamine how a purpose to create a body ‘subject only to the \npeople of the  United States’ — that is,  apparently, beyond \ncontrol  of  the  constitutionally  defined  branches  of \n \n134 Id. at 2198-99 (second part quoting Humphrey’s Executor, 295 \nU.S. at 628). \n135 Id. at 2199-2200. \nAlthough the CFPB does not conduct adjudications, it’s clear that \nSeila’s “substantial executive power” test applies to adjudicatory \nagencies like the MSPB and NLRB.  After all, Seila was describing \nthe  exception  in Humphrey’s,  which  dealt  with  an  adjudicatory \nagency — the 1935 FTC. \n136  Free  Enterprise  Fund,  537  F.3d  at  696  (Kavanaugh,  J., \ndissenting). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 30 of 114\n28 \ngovernment — could  itself  be  sustained  under  the \nConstitution.”137 \nOr  perhaps  it  was  because  Humphrey’s  relied  on \ninconsistent separation-of-powers logic, which fails to account \nfor how “an agency can at the same moment reside in both the \nlegislative and the judicial branches” without infringing on “the \n‘fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general \ndepartments of government entirely free from the control or \ncoercive influence . . . of either of the others.’”138   \nOr  perhaps  still  it  was  because  Humphrey’s  made \nincomprehensible distinctions “between ‘executive function’ \nand ‘executive power.’”139  “Of course the commission was \ncarrying  out  laws  Congress  had  enacted;  in  that  sense  its \nfunctions could hardly have been characterized as other than \nexecutive, whatever procedures it employed to accomplish its \nends.”140 \nWhatever the reason, without overturning Humphrey’s, \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  seemed  “keen  to  prune . . . \nHumphrey’s.”141    The  Court’s  recent  opinions  have \n“characterized the ‘independent agencies’ as executive and \n \n137  Peter  L.

As a result, while specifically \nlisting an executive agency’s executive functions is a sufficient basis \nfor concluding the President may remove that agency’s principal \nofficers, it is not a necessary basis.  See Collins, 141 S. Ct. at 1801 \n(Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) \n(arguing that Collins “broaden[ed]” Seila Law by clarifying that “the \nconstitutionality of removal restrictions does not hinge on the nature \nand breadth of an agency’s authority” (cleaned up)).  If it’s not \nexercising executive power, what is it doing in the executive branch?  \nCf.

And if the agency in question is the identical twin \nof the 1935 FTC (as Humphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC) \nthen Humphrey’s controls.   \nBut as Judge Henderson wrote in 2018, we should “be \nloath to cede any more of Article II than Humphrey’s Executor \nsquarely demands.”144  Since then, Seila Law and Collins have \nturned that wisdom into a binding command on the lower \ncourts.  As in the context of Bivens — like Humphrey’s, a \nprecedent not overruled but severely narrowed by subsequent \ndecisions — “[e]ven  a  modest  extension  is  still  an \nextension.”145  And because the Supreme Court has forbidden \nextensions of Humphrey’s to any new contexts, we cannot \nextend Humphrey’s — not even an inch.   \nIII. Stay Factors \nTo determine whether a stay pending appeal is appropriate, \n“we ask (1) whether the applicant is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, (2) whether it will suffer irreparable injury without a \nstay, (3) whether the stay will substantially injure the other \nparties interested in the proceedings, and (4) where the public \ninterest  lies.”146    “The  first  two  factors . . . are  the  most \ncritical.”147 \n \n144 PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 156 (Henderson, J., dissenting). \n145 Id.

Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nUnder binding Supreme Court precedent, Congress cannot \nrestrict the President’s power to remove the principal officers \nof agencies that “wield substantial executive power.”148  And \nfor the reasons explained below, the NLRB and the MSPB \n“exercis[e] substantial executive authority” — as then-Judge \nKavanaugh said in a dissent later vindicated by Seila Law.149   \nBecause those agencies exercise  “substantial  executive \npower,”150 the Government is likely to prevail in its contention \nthat the President may fire NLRB commissioners and MSPB \nmembers.   \n1.  Wilcox v. Trump \nThe NLRB is an executive branch agency that administers \nfederal labor law.151  It has five members who are “appointed \nby the President by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.”152  They serve five-year terms,  and the  President \nchooses “one member to serve as Chairman.”153  The statute \npurports to restrict the President’s removal power.154 \n \n148 Seila Law v.

It is not a “mere \nlegislative or judicial aid.”161  Instead, it is a (strong) arm of the \nexecutive branch and wields substantial executive power.162 \nTo  reinstate  Wilcox,  the  district  court  relied  on  an \noverbroad reading of Humphrey’s and a misplaced emphasis \non twentieth-century history. \nFirst,  beginning  with  Humphrey’s,  the  district  court \ncompared the NLRB to the 1935 FTC, arguing that they share \nsimilar functions and authorities.163  But the two agencies are \nfar from identical.  For one thing, the NLRB is not subject to a \nstatutorily imposed partisan-balance requirement.164  And the \nNLRB exercises authorities that the 1935 FTC did not.  For \nexample, it has the power to go directly to federal court to seek \ninjunctions  against  employers  or  unions  while  a  case  is \npending.165  And the NLRB’s ability to seek monetary relief \nlike backpay “against private parties on behalf of the United \n \n161 Id. \n162 True, as the district court pointed out, the General Counsel \n(removable at will) leads investigations and prosecutions “on behalf \nof the Board.”  Wilcox v.

But it is not our job to ask, “What \nwould the 1935 Court do?”  Rather, we must ask what the \nSupreme Court has done — in Humphrey’s yes, but also in \nSeila Law, Collins, and the Court’s other precedents (guided by \nthe  original  meaning  of  the  Constitution  when  binding \nprecedent does not answer the question).167 \nUnder Seila Law, “the Humphrey’s Executor exception \ndepend[s]” on “the set  of powers the  [Humphrey’s] Court \nconsidered as the basis for its decision, not any latent powers \nthat the agency may have had not alluded to by the Court.”168  \nUnder  Collins,  “the  President’s  removal  power  serves \nimportant  purposes  regardless  of  whether  the  agency  in \nquestion  affects  ordinary  Americans  by  directly  regulating \nthem or by taking actions that have a profound but indirect \neffect on their lives.”169   \nThe district court did not grapple with these developments, \ninstead fixating on Humphrey’s.

Humphrey’s covers \nnothing more than that because the reasoning in Seila Law and \nCollins requires a reading of Humphrey’s that covers nothing \nmore than that.  In other words, Humphrey’s can cover only an \nagency that exercises no “substantial executive power.”  The \ndistrict court “chants [Humphrey’s Executor] like a mantra, but \nno matter how many times it repeats those words, it cannot give \n[Humphrey’s Executor] substance” that Seila Law and Collins \nsay “that it lacks.”171 \nStrikingly, the district court gave short shrift to Collins, \ndismissing it in a footnote because it involved a single-headed \nagency and the Court “reaffirmed it ‘did not revisit its prior \ndecisions.’”172    Of  course  neither  Seila  Law  nor  Collins \noverruled Humphrey’s.  But we are not free to ignore the \nSupreme Court’s binding interpretation of its precedent simply \nbecause the Court didn’t overrule that precedent.   \nAfter Seila Law, a removal restriction is valid only if it \n(1) applies to a “multimember expert agenc[y], balanced along \npartisan lines” that (2) does not “wield substantial executive \npower.”173  Though the FHFA in Collins clearly failed the first \nprong, the Court also addressed the second prong.  When \nCollins  did  so,  it  arguably  “broaden[ed]”  Seila  Law  and \n \n170 Wilcox Opp. 1, 15, 16. \n171 SEC v. Jarkesy, 144 S.

The \ndistrict  court  found  it  persuasive  that  no  President  before \nPresident Trump removed an NLRB commissioner.175  But \nSupreme  Court  precedent,  not  twentieth-century  history, \nresolves this case.  And as the district court said, Congress’s \nwidespread  use  of  independent,  multimember  boards  and \ncommissions did not begin until the early 1900s.176  So even if \nwe were evaluating the original meaning of Article II on a \nblank slate, which we aren’t, that twentieth-century history \nwould be of limited value for discerning the Constitution’s \noriginal meaning.177   \nFinally,  the  district  court  described  the  President’s \nremoval of Wilcox as a “power grab” and “blatantly illegal.”178  \nBut  unconstitutional  statutes  are  void  ab  initio  because \n \n174 Id. at 1801 (Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment). \n175 Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at *5. \n176 See id. at *6. \n177  Similarly  unpersuasive  is  Wilcox’s  assertion  that  Congress \nspecifically designed the NLRB to be independent.

MSPB adjudication is nothing \nmore than intra-branch dispute resolution.  That’s an exercise \nof executive (not quasi-judicial) power. \nIn additional ways, the MSPB is not like the 1935 FTC as \nunderstood  by  Humphrey’s.    It  reviews  the  removal  and \ndiscipline of federal employees and has the power to directly \noverride other executive agencies’ disciplinary actions.198  That \ngives  it  a  significant  authority  that  the  FTC  never  had.  \nAdditionally, the MSPB has the power to issue binding orders \nand “enforce compliance with any such order.”199  The 1935 \nFTC lacked that power.  It could issue cease-and-desist orders, \nbut if those were disobeyed, the agency had to petition to a \nfederal court to enforce its orders.200   \nNor is the MSPB like the War Claims Commission in \nWiener.  The MSPB is a permanent body, unlike the temporary \nWar Claims Commission, which served the limited purpose of \nassigning distributions from a compensation fund.201  More \nimportantly, the MSPB’s powers far outstrip the War Claims \nCommission’s in a critical way — it can force the President to \n \n197 See Frazier v. MSPB, 672 F.2d 150, 154 (D.C.

To the extent its ability to invalidate \ncertain regulations resembles legislative activity, that authority \ndoes not involve public-facing regulation.203  So again, even \nunder a broad reading of Humphrey’s, the MSPB’s functions \ndo not align with those of the 1935 FTC or the War Claims \nCommission.  The MSPB “is hardly a mere legislative or \njudicial aid.”204  It does far more than merely make “reports and \nrecommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did.”205 \nThe district court recognized that the MSPB “preserves \npower within the executive branch by charging presidentially \nappointed  [MSPB]  members  with  mediation  and  initial \nadjudication  of  federal  employment  disputes.”206    But  the \ndistrict court erred in concluding that the MSPB’s “features” \nmade any effect on the President’s exercise of the executive \npower “limited.”207  To the contrary, as one member of the \nSupreme  Court  has  already  acknowledged,  the  preserved \npower within the MSPB is “substantial executive authority.”208  \nIn Harris’s tenure alone, the MSPB resolved thousands of \ncases involving “allegations that federal agencies engaged in \n \n202 Seila Law, 140 S.

Just because a CEO may informally \nadjudicate an internal employee dispute does not mean the \nCEO is any less the chief executive officer.  It’s part of the job.  \nWhat’s more, Harris has been a productive member of the \nMSPB, participating “in nearly 4,500 decisions” between June \n1, 2022, and February 10, 2025.210  In short, the district court’s \nself-contradictory assertion that the MSPB “does not wield \nsubstantial executive power, but rather spends nearly all of its \ntime adjudicating inward-facing personnel matters involving \nfederal employees,” tends to show that the MSPB does indeed \nexercise substantial executive power.211 \nFinally, the position of the Department of Justice two years \nago in Severino v. Biden, supports at-will removal of MSPB \nmembers.212    There,  DOJ  argued  that  the  President’s \nunrestricted  removal  power  did  not  extend  to  the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States because the \nConference “does not resolve or commence matters for the \nExecutive  Branch  or  determine  anyone’s  rights  or \nobligations.”213  The MSPB,  in  contrast, does  “resolve . . . \n \n209 Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *14. \n210 Id. at *2. \n211 Id. at *6 (cleaned up). \n212 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C.

Irreparable Harm \nA stay applicant must show that it will be irreparably \nharmed absent a stay.216 \nHere, the Government contends that the President suffers \nirreversible  harm  each  day  the  district  courts’  injunctions \nremain in effect because he is deprived of the constitutional \nauthority vested in him alone.  I agree. \n Article II vests the President with the “entire ‘executive \nPower,’”  which  “generally  includes  the  ability  to  remove \nexecutive officials.”217  The district courts’ orders effectively \nnullify that power.  That level of interference is “virtually \nunheard  of,”  and  “it  impinges  on  the  ‘conclusive  and \npreclusive’ power through which the President controls the \n \n214 Id. \n215 Order on Stay Request, Special Counsel ex rel John Doe v. \nDepartment of Agriculture, No. CB-1208-25-0020-U-1 (MSPB Mar. \n5, 2025), https://perma.cc/3F45-PKG5. \n216 Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \n217 Seila Law, 140 S.

Each year, the NLRB oversees tens \nof thousands of unfair labor practice charges and decides (on \naverage) roughly 200 cases.220  Additionally, the NLRB lacks \na quorum without Wilcox, meaning the district court’s order \ntips the scales in favor of political appointees that do not share \nthe President’s policy objectives.

Harm to Removed Officials \nAlthough the two “most critical” factors support issuing \nstays, I also consider whether those stays “will substantially \ninjure the other parties interested in the proceeding.”224 \nThey will not.  Harris and Wilcox identify harms that are \neither incognizable or outweighed by the irreparable harm \nsuffered  by  the  Government  under  the  district  courts’ \ninjunctions.225   \nFirst, Wilcox and Harris assert a statutory right to remain \nin office.  According to Harris, a stay will prevent her “from \nfulfilling  her  duties  while  removed,”  which  she  says  is \nirreparable because she “took an oath of office to fulfill specific \nstatutory functions set out by Congress.”226  Similarly, Wilcox \n \n223  Free  Enterprise  Fund,  537  F.3d  at  689  (Kavanaugh,  J., \ndissenting). \n224 Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \n225  Vague  assertions  about  presidential  removal  committing \n“violence to the statute Congress enacted” will not suffice — even \nsetting aside that an unconstitutional statutory provision cannot be \nvalidly enacted.

I’ve  explained  why  the  removal \nprovisions here are likely not constitutional.  And I assume that \nWilcox and Harris each took an oath to “support and defend the \nConstitution.”228  So I’m not convinced that their removals \ninflict any irreparable harm. \nSecond, both Harris and Wilcox allege that if we issue a \nstay,  their  agencies  will  be  harmed.    Specifically,  Wilcox \nargues that she (and the other NLRB commissioners) will be \n“deprived  of  the  ability  to  carry  out  their  congressional \nmandate in protecting labor rights” and “suffer an injury due to \nthe loss of the office’s independence.”229  She adds that her \nremoval “eliminated a quorum, . . . bringing an immediate and \nindefinite halt to the NLRB’s critical work.”230  For her part, \nHarris contends “a stay would mar the very independence that \nCongress  afforded  Harris  and  the  other  members  of  the \nBoard.”231 \nTo begin, those are institutional interests, not personal \ninterests, so we may take them into account only as they relate \nto the public interest.  Even then, this court recently doubted its \nability  to  “balance  [one  agency’s]  asserted  public  interest \nagainst the public interest asserted by the rest of the executive \n \n227 Wilcox Opp. 21 (quoting Harris v.

Conclusion \nThe  district  courts  did  their  level  best  in  rushed \ncircumstances to follow Supreme Court precedent.  But their \nfidelity to that precedent was unduly selective.  By reading \nHumphrey’s Executor in an expansive manner, they read it in a \nmanner that Seila Law and Collins preclude.  Though those \ncases did not overturn Humphrey’s Executor, their holdings \nrelied on an exceptionally narrow reading of it. \nEven the most casual reader will have guessed by now that \nI agree with how Seila Law and Collins read Humphrey’s \nExecutor.  But even if I disagreed with them, this court would \nlack the authority to undo what they did.  For a lower court like \nus, that would be a “power grab.”238  \n \n237 Chadha, 462 U.S. at 944. \n238 Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at *3. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 51 of 114\n \nKAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge, concurring \nin  the  grants  of  stay:    I  agree  with  many  of  the  general \nprinciples in Judge Walker’s opinion about the contours of \npresidential  power  under  Article  II  of  the  Constitution, \nalthough I view the government’s likelihood of success on the \nmerits as a slightly closer call.  Whatever the continuing vitality \nof Humphrey’s, I agree that we should not extend it in this \npreliminary  posture  during  the  pendency  of  these  highly \nexpedited appeals.  I write separately to highlight areas of the \nmerits inquiry that remain murky and to emphasize that the \ngovernment has easily carried its burden of showing irreparable \nharm—the second of the two “most critical” stay factors.  Nken \nv. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009). \nA. \nI do not repeat at length here my views on the presidential \nremoval power doctrine pre-Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n197 (2020), which I expressed in PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 \nF.3d  75,  138  (D.C.  Cir.  2018)  (en  banc)  (Henderson,  J., \ndissenting).  Instead, I emphasize certain ways in which Seila \nLaw left unclear where the rule from Myers v. United States, \n272 U.S. 52 (1926), ends and the exception from Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), begins. \nSeila Law described the scope of the Humphrey’s Executor \nexception as applying to “multimember expert agencies that do \nnot wield substantial executive power.”  591 U.S. at 218.  The \nCourt first observed that the CFPB is not a multimember expert \nagency because it “is led by a single Director who cannot be \ndescribed as a ‘body of experts’ and cannot be considered ‘non-\npartisan’ in the same sense as a group of officials drawn from \nboth sides of the aisle.”  Id.  The Court then distinguished the \nCFPB from the 1935 FTC—which had been characterized as a \n“mere  legislative  or  judicial  aid”—based  on  three  sets  of \npowers.    Id.    Those  powers  “must  be  exercises  of”  the \n“executive Power” under our constitutional structure but they \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 52 of 114\n2 \ncan “take ‘legislative’ and ‘judicial’ forms.”  Id. at 216 n.2 \n(quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 305 n.4 \n(2013)). \nFirst, in terms of executive power with a legislative form \nthe  CFPB  Director  “possesses  the  authority  to  promulgate \nbinding rules fleshing out 19 federal statutes, including a broad \nprohibition  on  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  in  a  major \nsegment of the U.S. economy.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  \nSecond,  as  to  executive  power  with  a  judicial  form,  “the \nDirector may unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal \nand equitable relief in administrative adjudications.”  Id. at 219.  \nThird,  regarding  purely  executive  power,  “the  Director’s \nenforcement authority includes the power to seek daunting \nmonetary penalties against private parties on behalf of the \nUnited States in federal court—a quintessentially executive \npower not considered in Humphrey’s Executor.”  Id.  Based on \nthe breadth of those three powers, and before going on to raise \nother concerns about the novelty of the CFPB’s structure, the \nCourt held that the CFPB was “[u]nlike the New Deal-era FTC \nupheld [in Humphrey’s].”  Id. at 218. \nThe next question becomes what kind of agency—single- \nor  multi-headed—falls  on  either  side  of  Seila  Law’s \n“substantial executive power” dividing line.  On the one hand, \na plurality of the Seila Law court mused in its discussion of \nseverability that “[o]ur severability analysis does not foreclose \nCongress from pursuing alternative responses to the problem—\nfor  example,  converting  the  CFPB  into  a  multimember \nagency.”  Id. at 237 (Roberts, C.J.).  But simply converting the \nCFPB into a multi-headed agency could not have sufficed \nbecause the Court had earlier explained that the CFPB failed \nthe Humphrey’s “substantial executive power” test.  See Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 218–19 (maj. op.) (explaining why the CFPB \nitself falls outside the Humphrey’s exception).  Perhaps the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 53 of 114\n3 \nplurality’s dictum in another section of the opinion meant that \nsuch  a  response  would  be  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient \ncondition.  Conversely, Seila Law’s gloss on Humphrey’s did \nuse  the  same  phrase—“substantial  executive  power”—as \nJustice Kavanaugh’s dissent in PHH when he was a judge on \nthis court.  881 F.3d at 167 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  That \nopinion listed both the NLRB and the MSPB as “agencies \nexercising substantial executive authority.”  Id. at 173. \nIn Collins v. Yellen, the Court further explained that “the \nnature and breadth of an agency’s authority is not dispositive \nin determining whether Congress may limit the President’s \npower to remove its head.”  594 U.S. 220, 251–52 (2021).  \nInstead, “[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the relative \nimportance of the regulatory and enforcement  authority of \ndisparate  agencies,  and  we  do  not  think  that  the \nconstitutionality  of  removal  restrictions  hinges  on  such  an \ninquiry.”  Id. at 253; see also id. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring \nin part and concurring in the judgment) (recognizing Collins’ \n“broadening”  of  Seila  Law);  id.  at  293  (Sotomayor,  J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (same).  However, \nCollins  did  not  discuss  Humphrey’s  and  the  Court \ncharacterized its decision as a “straightforward application of \nour reasoning in Seila Law” because the agency there was also \n“led by a single Director.”  Id. at 251 (maj. op.).  Thus, it is not \nclear that Collins’ instruction not to weigh up the nature and \nbreadth  of  an  agency’s  authority  extends  to  multimember \nboards. \nAccordingly,  reasonable  minds  can—and  often  do—\ndisagree  about  the  ongoing  vitality  of  the  Humphrey’s \nexception.  See, e.g., Consumers’ Rsch. v. CPSC, 98 F.4th 646 \n(5th Cir.) (mem.) (splitting 9–8 on whether to grant rehearing \nen  banc  on  the  constitutionality  of  the  Consumer  Product \nSafety  Commission’s  removal  restrictions).    But  simply \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 54 of 114\n4 \napplying Seila Law’s test and examining both the NLRB’s and \nthe MSPB’s executive powers—regardless of their legislative, \njudicial and executive forms—the government has satisfied its \nburden of showing a strong likelihood that they are substantial.  \nBoth Wilcox and Harris concede that their agencies wield \nsubstantial power of an “adjudicative” form—indeed, that is \nhow they hope to fall within the Humphrey’s exception.  We \nmust therefore consider those powers that are of a legislative \nand executive form. \nThe NLRB has traditionally preferred to set precedent by \nadjudicating,  Wilcox  v.  Trump,  2025  WL 720914,  at  *9 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025), but it retains broad authority of a \nlegislative form to promulgate “such rules and regulations as \nmay be necessary to carry out” its statutory mandate, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 156.  Moreover, its regulatory authority over labor relations \naffects a “major segment of the U.S. economy.”  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 218.  Indeed, the district court explained that the \nNLRB was established by the Congress “in response to a long \nand  violent  struggle  for  workers’  rights,”    Wilcox,  2025 \nWL 720914, at *3, and emphasized its indisputably “important \nwork,” id. at *17.  Granted, the NLRB’s executive power is \npartly  bifurcated  because  the  General  Counsel  investigates \ncharges and prosecutes complaints before the Board.  See 29 \nU.S.C. § 153(d).  However, as Judge Walker points out, the \nBoard retains the power to “seek monetary relief like backpay \n‘against private parties on behalf of the United States in federal \ncourt,’  [which  is]  a  ‘quintessentially  executive  power  not \nconsidered in Humphrey’s Executor.’”  Op. (Walker, J.) at 32 \n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219). \nThe MSPB’s powers are relatively more circumscribed.  In \nterms of power of a legislative form, its rulemaking authority \nis limited to issuing “such regulations as may be necessary for \nthe  performance  of  its  functions.”    5  U.S.C.  § 1204(h).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 55 of 114\n5 \nHowever, it possesses the negative power, even if rarely used, \nto review sua sponte and invalidate regulations issued by the \nOffice of Personnel Management.  Id. § 1204(f).  As to power \nof  an  executive  form,  at  least  in  certain  circumstances  it \nrepresents itself litigating in federal court.  See Harris Decl. \n¶ 33  (Harris  Opp’n  App.  B  at  7–8);  5  U.S.C.  §§ 1204(i), \n7703(a)(2).  As the Supreme Court stated in Buckley v. Valeo, \n424 U.S. 1, 139–40 (1976), the “responsibility for conducting \ncivil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating \npublic rights” is one of the “executive functions.”  The MSPB’s \nlitigation power also distinguishes it from other agencies that \ncannot be respondents in federal court.  See, e.g., Oil, Chem. & \nAtomic Workers Int’l Union v. OSHRC, 671 F.2d 643, 651–53 \n(D.C. Cir. 1982) (explaining that the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission cannot be a respondent in federal \ncourt and contrasting it with the NLRB).  And Harris as a single \nMSPB member recently wielded considerable power over the \nexecutive by temporarily reinstating thousands of probationary \nemployees.  Order on Stay Request (Mar. 5, 2025) (Harris \nOpp’n App. C).1 \nGranted, in Seila Law the Court distinguished the Office \nof the Special Counsel from the CFPB in part because the OSC \n“does not bind private parties,” 591 U.S. at 221, and the MSPB \nsimilarly operates entirely within the executive branch.  But it \nmay be that the Court was simply highlighting that the CFPB \nposed more of a threat to individual liberty than the OSC rather \nthan diminishing the constitutional problem of dividing power \nwithin the executive branch.  Compare PHH, 881 F.3d at 183 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (emphasizing the CFPB’s structure \n \n1  Indeed,  Harris’s  declaration  recites  that  she  “cannot  issue \nadjudication decisions unilaterally,” Harris Decl. ¶ 26 (Harris Opp’n \nApp. B at 5), thereby conceding that perhaps her most expansive \naction  to  date—“staying”  the  termination  of  executive  branch \nemployees by the thousands—is not in fact adjudicative. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 56 of 114\n6 \nas a threat to individual liberty), with Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n223  (explaining  that  the  Framers  sought  to  “divide”  the \nlegislative power and “fortif[y]” the executive power) (quoting \nThe Federalist No. 51 (J. Madison)). \nAccordingly, the first Nken factor is a somewhat closer call \nin my view than in Judge Walker’s but the government has met \nits  “strong  showing”  burden  at  this  stage  because  of  the \nsubstantial executive power that the NLRB and MSPB both \nwield. \nB. \nIn addition, the government has more than satisfied its \nburden to show irreparable harm that far outweighs any harm \nto Harris and Wilcox from a stay.  As Harris concedes, the \n“question of whether the government will prevail is distinct \nfrom  whether  the  government  will  suffer  irreparable  harm \nabsent a stay.”  Harris Opp’n 19.  Thus, we consider whether \nany harm suffered by the government can be undone if it \nprevails. \nAs this panel explained in Dellinger v. Bessent, “it is \nimpossible to unwind the days during which a President is \n‘directed to recognize and work with an agency head whom he \nhas already removed.’”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052, slip \nop. at 6 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (alterations omitted) (quoting \nDellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 559669, at *16 (D.C. Cir. Feb. \n15,  2025)  (Katsas,  J.,  dissenting)).    Such  a  requirement \nencroaches  on  the  President’s  “conclusive  and  preclusive” \npower to supervise those wielding executive power on his \nbehalf.  Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 608–09 (2024) \n(citing Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204; Myers, 272 U.S. at 106). \nHarris is also wrong to downplay the government’s injury \nas a “vague assertion of harm to the separation of powers.”  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 57 of 114\n7 \nHarris Opp’n 20.  In addition to the concrete actions by the \nNLRB and the MSPB that Judge Walker details, Op. (Walker, \nJ.) at 45, the executive branch—not merely the separation of \npowers—is  harmed  through  (1)  a  “[d]iminution  of  the \nPresidency” and (2) a “[l]ack of accountability,” see PHH, 881 \nF.3d at 155–60 (Henderson, J., dissenting). \nFirst, as the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise \nFund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 499 (2010), our “Constitution \nwas  adopted  to  enable  the  people  to  govern  themselves, \nthrough their elected leaders.”  The growth of the “headless \nFourth  Branch”  of  government,  FCC  v.  Fox  Television \nStations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  502,  525–26  (2009)  (Scalia,  J.), \n“heightens the concern that [the Executive Branch] may slip \nfrom the Executive’s control, and thus from that of the people, \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 499.  It is incongruous with the \nPresident’s duty to  “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, that he be “fasten[ed]” with \nprincipal officers who “by their different views of policy might \nmake his taking care that the laws be faithfully executed most \ndifficult or impossible,” Myers, 272 U.S. at 131.  It makes no \ndifference that the President can appoint the chair or other \nmembers of a board to reduce the magnitude or duration of this \ndiminution—it is a diminution nonetheless.  See PHH, 881 \nF.3d at 156–57 (Henderson, J., dissenting) (“Even assuming \nthe CFPB violates Article II only some of the time—a year \nhere, a couple years there—that is not a strong point in its \nfavor.”). \nSecond,  the  Framers  decided  to  check  the  President’s \nuniquely  concentrated  power  by  making  him  “the  most \ndemocratic  and  politically  accountable  official  in \nGovernment.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  That accountability \nis “enhanced by the solitary nature of the Executive Branch, \nwhich  provides  ‘a  single  object  for  the  jealousy  and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 58 of 114\n8 \nwatchfulness of the people.’”  Id. (quoting The Federalist No. \n70  (A.  Hamilton)).    Accordingly,  the  President  “cannot \ndelegate  ultimate  responsibility  or  the  active  obligation  to \nsupervise that goes with it . . . .”  Id. (quoting Free Enter. Fund, \n561 U.S. at 496–97).  Without the power to remove principal \nofficers, “the President could not be held fully accountable for \ndischarging  his  own  responsibilities;  the  buck  would  stop \nsomewhere else.”  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 514.  That the \nbuck would stop with members of a board rather than a solitary \nagency head obstructing his agenda does not eliminate his \ninjury. \nConversely, both Harris and Wilcox assert harm from their \ninability to perform their official functions in addition to any \nbackpay to which they may be entitled if they prevail.  See \nWilcox Opp’n 21 (arguing harm of deprivation of “statutory \nright to function”)  Harris Opp’n 23 (arguing stay will “prevent \nHarris from fulfilling her duties”).  Indeed, the district courts \nfound injuries to Harris and Wilcox in being deprived of the \n“statutory right to function” as well as distinct injuries to their \nagencies.  Harris v. Bessent, 2025 WL 679303, at *13 (D.D.C. \nMar. 13, 2025) (quoting Berry v. Reagan, 1983 WL 538, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. \nCir. 1983) (per curiam)); see also Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at \n*15–16 (citing Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5).  Needless to say, \nwe are not bound by a vacated district court decision from 40 \nyears ago.  At this stage at least, it is far from clear that Harris \nor Wilcox may assert rights against the executive branch on \nbehalf of their offices or agencies as opposed to themselves \npersonally.  See Op. (Walker, J.) at 46–48. \nFor its part, the government cites Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. \n811, 820 (1997), for the proposition that “public officials have \nno individual right to the powers of their offices.”  Harris Gov’t \nMot. 3; Wilcox Gov’t Mot. 3.  The Supreme Court in Raines \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 59 of 114\n9 \npointed out that if a federal court were to have heard a dispute \nbetween  the  President  and  the  Congress  about  the \nconstitutionality  of  restrictions  on  the  presidential  removal \npower,  it  “would  have  been  improperly  and  unnecessarily \nplunged into the bitter political battle being waged between” \nthem.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 827.  Instead, Presidents wait for “a \nsuit brought by a plaintiff with traditional Article III standing.”  \nId.  Here, we are being asked to enter a political battle between \nthe institutional offices of the NLRB, the MSPB and other \nexecutive-branch officials, including the President. \nThe district court in Harris sought to distinguish Raines by \nobserving that it addressed whether legislators had standing to \nchallenge a vote that did not go their way, that the injury was \ndiffused  across  members  of  the  Congress  and  that  “the \nlegislators did not claim injury arising from ‘something to \nwhich they personally are entitled.’”  2025 WL 679303, at *13 \n(quoting Raines, 521 U.S. at 821).  But the next clause of the \nquoted language reads:  “such as their seats as Members of \nCongress after their constituents had elected them.”  Raines, \n521 U.S. at 821.  Here, voters elected the President, not Harris \nor Wilcox.  As in Raines, Harris’s and Wilcox’s “injury thus \nruns (in a sense) with the Member’s seat, a seat which the \nMember holds (it may quite arguably be said) as trustee . . . , \nnot  as  a  prerogative  of  personal  power.”    Id.  (citing  The \nFederalist No. 62 (J. Madison)).  Moreover, in Raines the \nlegislators  “had  not  been  authorized  to  represent  their \nrespective Houses of Congress in th[e] action, and indeed both \nHouses actively oppose[d] their suit.”  Id. at 829.  Here, there \nis at least a serious question whether Harris and Wilcox seek to \nvindicate personal rights or only those of the office and agency, \nand their suits are actively opposed by their own branch of \ngovernment. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 60 of 114\n10 \nAs we recently explained in Dellinger, “[a]t worst” Harris \nand Wilcox “would remain out of office for a short period of \ntime.”  Dellinger, slip op. at 7.  Because we have ordered highly \nexpedited merits briefing with the agreement of the parties, that \nperiod is particularly brief.  See Order, Wilcox v. Trump, No. \n25-5057 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 18, 2025); Order, Harris v. Bessent, \nNo. 25-5037 &  25-5055 (D.C. Cir.  Mar. 18, 2025).   “By \ncontrast, the potential injury to the government of . . . having \nto  try  and  unravel  [Harris’s  and  Wilcox’s]  actions  is \nsubstantial.”  Dellinger, slip op. at 7.  Thus, even if the first \nNken factor is not a lead-pipe cinch, the injury-focused factors \nplainly favor a stay. \nC. \nIn terms of the public interest, and as we explained in \nDellinger, it is not clear how we could balance Harris’s and \nWilcox’s asserted public interest on behalf of the MSPB and \nNLRB continuing to function as the Congress intended against \nthe public interest asserted by the rest of the executive branch.  \nSee  Dellinger,  slip  op.  at  7.    And  of  course,  “[o]nly  the \nPresident (along with the Vice President) is elected by the \nentire Nation.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  At minimum, this \nfactor does not weigh in Harris’s and Wilcox’s favor. \n* * * \nAccordingly, the government has met its burden for grants \nof a stay during the pendency of these appeals. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 61 of 114\n \nMILLETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  The  two opinions \nvoting  to  grant  a  stay  rewrite  controlling  Supreme  Court \nprecedent and ignore binding rulings of this court, all in favor \nof putting this court in direct conflict with at least two other \ncircuits.  The stay decision also marks the first time in history \nthat a court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, has licensed the \ntermination of members of multimember adjudicatory boards \nstatutorily protected by the very type of removal restriction the \nSupreme Court has twice unanimously upheld.   \n \nWhat is more, the stay order strips the National Labor \nRelations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board of the \nquora that the district courts’ injunctions preserved, disabling \nagencies that Congress created and funded from acting for as \nlong as the President wants them out of commission.  That \ndecision will leave languishing hundreds of unresolved legal \nclaims  that  the  Political  Branches  jointly  and  deliberately \nchanneled to these expert adjudicatory entities.  In addition, the \nmajority decisions’ rationale openly calls into question the \nconstitutionality of dozens of federal statutes conditioning the \nremoval  of  officials  on  multimember  decision-making \nbodies—everything from the Federal Reserve Board and the \nNuclear  Regulatory  Commission  to  the  National \nTransportation Safety Board and the Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims.   \n \nThat would be an extraordinary decision for a lower federal \ncourt to make under any circumstances.  But what makes it \neven more striking is that all we are supposed to decide today \nis whether a stay pending appeal should issue.  As to that \nnarrow question, the stay decision is an unprecedented and, in \nmy view, wholly unwarranted use of this court’s stay power, \nwhich is meant only to maintain the status quo pending an \nappeal.    See Nken  v.  Holder,  556  U.S.  418,  429 \n(2009) (“A stay simply  suspend[s]  judicial  alteration  of \nthe status quo,” which is defined as “the state of affairs before \nthe  removal  order[s]  [were]  entered.”)  (citation  omitted); \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 62 of 114\n2 \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, \nInc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (A stay pending appeal \nis “preventative, or protective; it seeks to maintain the status \nquo pending a final determination of the merits of the suit.”); \nsee also Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733–734 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (“[T]he status quo [i]s ‘the last peaceable \nuncontested status’ existing between the parties before the \ndispute  developed.”)  (quoting  11A  Charles  Alan  Wright, \nArthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 2948 (3d ed. 1998)).   \n \nI cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary \nfirst-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the \nlaw that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap \nin legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the \nlaw says must go to these boards for the resolution of their \nemployment disputes.  I would deny a stay. \n \nI \n \nA \n \nThese cases arise out of the summary termination, without \nnotice, of two members of multimember adjudicatory bodies \nthat Congress created to resolve disputes impartially and free \nof political influence for reasons of grave national importance. \n \n  Cathy Harris is a member of the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard (“MSPB”).  The MSPB is an adjudicatory body that \nprimarily  reviews  federal  employees’  appeals  alleging  that \ntheir government employer discriminated against them based \non  their  race,  color,  gender,  political  affiliation,  religion, \nnational  origin,  age,  disability,  or  marital  status;  retaliated \nagainst  them  for  whistleblowing;  failed  to  comply  with \nprotections for veterans; or otherwise subjected them to an \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 63 of 114\n3 \nadverse employment action, such as termination, suspension, \nor a reduction in pay grade, 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(a)(1); 1221; \n2302(b)(1), (8)–(9); 3330a(d); 7512. \n \nThe MSPB has three members who are appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate to serve \nseven-year terms.  5 U.S.C. §§ 1201, 1202(a)–(c).  No more \nthan two members of the MSPB may belong to the same \npolitical party.  Id. § 1201.  The President can also appoint one \nof the members, with the advice and consent of the Senate, as \nthe Chair of the MSPB.  Id. § 1203(a).  MSPB members may \nbe  removed  only  for  “inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.”  Id. § 1202(d). \n \n  Gwynne Wilcox is a member, and former Chair, of the \nNational Labor Relations Board (“NRLB”), which Congress \ncharged with “prevent[ing] any person from engaging in any \nunfair labor practice[.]”  29 U.S.C. § 160(a).  The NLRB has \ntwo distinct parts.  The five-member Board, on which Wilcox \nsits, adjudicates appeals of labor disputes from administrative \nlaw judges.  Id. § 153(a).  Separately, the NLRB  General \nCounsel prosecutes unfair labor-practice charges.  Id. § 153(d); \nsee also NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 139 \n(1975).    These  two  divisions  of  the  Board  operate \nindependently.  NLRB. v. United Food & Com. Workers Union, \nLoc. 23, AFL-CIO, 484 U.S. 112, 118 (1987). \n \nWhen reviewing administrative law judge decisions, the \nNLRB reviews the entire record, receives briefing, and issues \nits own decision on both the facts and the law.  29 U.S.C. \n§ 160(c); 29 C.F.R. § 101.12.  The Board may issue a cease-\nand-desist order to halt unfair labor practices, or it may issue \nan order requiring reinstatement of terminated employees, with \nor without backpay, and similar equitable remedies.  29 U.S.C. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 64 of 114\n4 \n§ 160(c).  These orders, however, are not self-executing.  They \nare enforceable only by a federal court.  Id. § 160(e). \n \nThe President appoints NLRB members with the advice \nand consent of the Senate, and the members serve staggered \nfive-year  terms.    29  U.S.C.  § 153(a).    The  President  also \ndesignates one of the members to serve as Chair.  Id.  Congress \nlimited the President’s power to remove a Board member to \n“neglect  of  duty  or  malfeasance  in  office,”  and  required \nadvance notice and a hearing.  Id.  In contrast, the President \nmay remove the General Counsel at will.  See id. § 153(d).   \n \nB \n \n1 \n \nCathy Harris began her seven-year term as a member of the \nMSPB in June 2022.  On February 10, 2025, Harris received \nan  email  from  the  White  House  Office  of  Presidential \nPersonnel stating:  “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I \nam writing to inform you that your position on the Merit \nSystems  Protection  Board  is  terminated,  effective \nimmediately.”  Declaration of Cathy Harris (“Harris Decl.”) \n¶ 4.  The email did not allege any inefficiency, neglect of duty, \nor malfeasance on Harris’s part. \n \nHarris filed suit on February 11th, challenging her removal \nas  ultra  vires,  unconstitutional,  and  a  violation  of  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  She sought relief under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, issuance of a writ of mandamus, \nand equitable  relief.   The district court awarded  summary \njudgment to Harris and granted a permanent injunction and \ndeclaratory relief maintaining her in office.  Harris v. Bessent, \n__ F. Supp. 3d __, No. 25-cv-412 (RC), 2025 WL 679303, at \n*3 (D.D.C. March 4, 2025).  The court added that, if equitable \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 65 of 114\n5 \nrelief were “unavailable[,]” it would issue a writ of mandamus \n“as an alternative remedy at law.”  Id. at *15. \n \n2 \n \n  Gwynne Wilcox was confirmed in September 2023 for her \nsecond term as a member of the NLRB.  President Biden \ndesignated her Chair of the Board in December 2024.  On \nJanuary 27, 2025, Wilcox received an email from the White \nHouse Office of Presidential Personnel stating that she was \n“hereby removed from the office of Member[] of the National \nLabor Relations Board.”  Declaration of Gwynne Wilcox Ex. \nA, at 1.  Wilcox did not receive the statutorily required advance \nnotice of her termination, and the email did not offer Wilcox a \nhearing or claim any neglect of duty or malfeasance on her part.  \nId.; see also Motions Hearing Tr. 51:6–14 (March 5, 2025) \n(government acknowledging that Wilcox was not “removed for \nany neglect or malfeasance”). \n \nWilcox  sued  President  Trump  and  the  new  Board \nChairman, Marvin Kaplan, on February 5th, alleging that her \nremoval  violated  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act.    Her \ncomplaint sought an injunction directing Kaplan to reinstate \nher as a member of the Board.  Because the suit involved only \nquestions  of  law,  Wilcox  promptly  moved  for  expedited \nsummary  judgment.    The  district  court  granted  summary \njudgment for Wilcox, holding that her removal was unlawful \nand issued a permanent injunction maintaining her in office.  \nWilcox v. Trump, __ F. Supp. 3d__, No. 25-cv-334 (BAH), \n2025 WL 720914, at *5, 18 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 66 of 114\n6 \n3 \n \nThe government appealed the judgments in both Harris’s \nand Wilcox’s cases and seeks a stay of the district courts’ \njudgments. \n \nII \n \nA  stay  pending  appeal  is  an  “extraordinary”  remedy.  \nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election \nComm’n, 904 F.3d 1014, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam).  \nTo obtain such exceptional relief, the stay applicant must (1) \nmake a “strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the \nmerits”  of  the  appeal;  (2)  demonstrate  that  it  will  be \n“irreparably injured” before the appeal concludes; (3) show \nthat issuing a stay will not “substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding”; and (4) establish that “the public \ninterest” favors a stay.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hilton \nv. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \n \nThe government has satisfied none of those stay factors.  \nFirst, the government has failed to make any showing, let alone \na “strong showing[,] that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits” \nin its appeal to this court.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; see also id. \n(the likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable injury \nare the “most critical” factors).  Controlling Supreme Court \nprecedents—Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. \n602  (1935),  and  Wiener  v.  United  States,  357  U.S.  349 \n(1958)—establish  that  the  MSPB  and  NLRB’s  for-cause \nremoval protections are constitutional.  Circuit precedent binds \nthis  panel  to  that  same  conclusion.    In  addition,  the \ngovernment’s  efforts  to  de-constitutionalize  those  statutory \nprotections are unlikely to succeed given the long tradition of \nremoval limitations and their particular justifications.   \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 67 of 114\n7 \nSecond, the government has not identified any irreparable \nharm that would arise from a stay while these appeals are \nexpeditiously  decided.    Its  argument  that  the  President’s \nremoval power is irreparably impaired depends entirely on this \ncourt overturning Supreme Court rulings holding that these \nremoval protections do not unconstitutionally encroach on the \nPresident’s power. \n \nThird, the balance of harms to the plaintiffs and the public \ninterest weighs strongly against a stay.   \n \nIII \n \nA \n \nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Humphrey’s Executor \nand Wiener squarely foreclose the government’s arguments on \nappeal.  In those cases, the Supreme Court unanimously held \nthat  for-cause  removal  protections  like  those  applicable  to \nMSPB and NLRB members were constitutional as applied to \nofficials on multimember independent agencies that exercise \nquasi-adjudicatory and quasi-legislative functions within the \nExecutive Branch—just like those undertaken by the MSPB \nand NLRB.  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624; Wiener, \n357 U.S. at 355–356.   \n \nIn Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court upheld for-\ncause removal protections for members of the Federal Trade \nCommission (“FTC”).  295 U.S. at 620.  The Court reasoned \nthat,  as  a  five-member  board  with  no  more  than  three \ncommissioners from the same political party, the FTC was \ndesigned to be “nonpartisan” and “act with entire impartiality.”  \nId. at 619–620, 624.  In addition, the FTC was “charged with \nthe enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law.”  Id. \nat 624.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 68 of 114\n8 \n \nIn  that  way,  the  FTC’s  functions  were  held  to  be \n“predominantly  quasi-judicial  and  quasi-legislative.”  \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.  The Commission’s \nfunctions  were  quasi-judicial  because  it  could  hold \n“hearing[s]”  on  claims  alleging  “unfair  methods  of \ncompetition,” prepare “report[s] in writing stating its findings \nas to the facts,” and “issue * * * cease and desist order[s,]” \nwhich  only  federal  courts  (and  not  the  FTC  itself)  could \nenforce.  Id. at 620–622, 628.  The FTC was quasi-legislative, \nin that the Commission “fill[ed] in and administer[ed] the \ndetails”  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act  and  made \n“investigations  and  reports  * * *  for  the  information  of \nCongress[.]”  Id. at 628.   \n \nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed Humphrey’s Executor two \ndecades later.  In Wiener, the Court upheld for-cause removal \nprotections for members of the War Claims Commission—a \nthree-member body that adjudicated Americans’ injury and \nproperty claims against Nazi Germany and its allies.  357 U.S. \nat 350.  The Court concluded that the Commission could not \naccomplish  its  adjudicatory  function—fairly  applying \n“evidence and governing legal considerations” to the “merits” \nof claims—without some protection against removal.  Id. at \n355–356.    The  Constitution,  the  Court  held,  permitted \nsheathing “the Damocles’ sword of removal” by instituting for-\ncause protections for Commission members.  Id. at 356. \n \nThe Wiener Court also clarified what qualifies as a “quasi-\njudicial”  function.    It  explained  that,  even  though  the \nCommission was part of the Executive Branch, its role was \npurely adjudicatory because Congress “chose to establish a \nCommission to ‘adjudicate according to law’ the classes of \nclaims defined in the statute[.]”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 355.  That \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 69 of 114\n9 \ndemonstrated the “intrinsic judicial character of the task with \nwhich the Commission was charged.”  Id. \n \nB \n \nHumphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener  are  precedential \ndecisions that bind this court.  Even as the Supreme Court has \nrejected more modern and novel constraints on the removal of \nsingle  heads  of  agencies  exercising  substantial  executive \npower, its modern precedent has consistently announced that \nHumphrey’s  Executor  remains  “in  place[.]”    Seila  Law  v. \nCFPB,  591  U.S.  197,  215  (2020);  see  id.  at  228  (“not \nrevisit[ing] Humphrey’s Executor”); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 250–251 (2021) (recognizing that Seila Law did “not \nrevisit [] prior decisions”) (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204); \nsee also Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 687 (1988) (in case \ninvolving  restrictions  on  removal  of  an  inferior  officer, \nrecognizing that Humphrey’s Executor remains good law); see \ngenerally Free Enter. Fund v. Public Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 \nU.S. 477, 483 (2010) (in case involving multimember board, \ndeclining to “reexamine” Humphrey’s Executor); id. at 501 \n(“[W]e  do  not”  “take  issue  with  for-cause  limitations  in \ngeneral[.]”). \n \nFree Enterprise Fund, for example, held unconstitutional \ndouble-layered  for-cause  removal  protections.    That  is, \nMembers of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \ncould be removed only for cause by the Securities Exchange \nCommission,  whose  members,  in  turn,  the  Court  accepted \ncould be removed by the President only for cause.  Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 484–487.  The Supreme Court held that a \ntwice-restricted removal power imposed too great a constraint \non the President’s authority.  Id. at 492.   \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 70 of 114\n10 \nIn devising a remedy, the Supreme Court left the Securities \nand Exchange Commission’s accepted single-layer removal \nprotections intact; only the Board’s protections were stricken.  \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 492, 495, 509.  The Court found \nthis would be a sufficient constitutional remedy because, even \nwith  the  Commissioners  enjoying  for-cause  protection,  the \nPresident could “then hold the Commission to account for its \nsupervision of the Board, to the same extent that he may hold \nthe Commission to account for everything else it does.”  Id. at \n495–496.    In  so  ruling,  the  Court  repeated  the  rule  from \nHumphrey’s  Executor  that  “Congress  can,  under  certain \ncircumstances, create independent agencies run by principal \nofficers appointed by the President, whom the President may \nnot remove at will but only for good cause.”  Id. at 483. \n \nSeila Law likewise repeated that  Humphrey’s  Executor \nremains governing precedent.  In that case, the Supreme Court \ninvalidated the removal protections for the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”)’s single director because she had \n“sole  responsibility  to  administer  19  separate  consumer-\nprotections  statutes”  and  could  “unilaterally,  without \nmeaningful  supervision,  issue  final  regulations,  oversee \nadjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, \nand determine what penalties to impose on private parties.”  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 219, 225.  Structural features of the \nCFPB further insulated the director from presidential control.  \nBecause the agency was headed by one director with a five-\nyear term, “some Presidents may not have any opportunity to \nshape its leadership and thereby influence its activities.”  Id. at \n225.  The CFPB also receives its funding from the Federal \nReserve  Board,  which  is  funded  outside  of  the  annual \nappropriations process, further diluting presidential oversight.  \nId. at 226. \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 71 of 114\n11 \nImportantly, the Supreme Court’s decision was explicit that \nHumphrey’s Executor remains “in place.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 215; id. at 228 (“[W]e do not revisit Humphrey’s Executor \nor any other precedent today[.]”).  In fact, in Seila Law, three \nJustices invited Congress to “remedy[] the [CFPB’s] defect” by \n“converting the CFPB into a multimember agency,” id. at 237 \n(Roberts, C.J., joined by Alito and Kavanaugh, JJ., concurring \nin the judgment), and four more Justices agreed that such a \nredesign would be constitutional, id. at 298 (Kagan, J., joined \nby Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., concurring in the \njudgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part). \n \nMost recently, the Supreme Court’s decision in Collins, \nwhich struck down another single-headed agency performing \npredominantly executive functions, also acknowledged that \nHumphrey’s Executor remained precedential.  Collins, 594 \nU.S. at 250–251. \n \nC \n \nUnder  the  precedent  set  in  Humphrey’s  Executor  and \nWiener, and preserved in Free Enterprise Fund, Seila Law, and \nCollins,  the  MSPB  and  NLRB  removal  protections  are \nconstitutional.   \n \n1 \n \nThe MSPB is a “multimember expert agenc[y] that do[es] \nnot wield substantial executive power[.]”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 218.  No more than two of its three members may hail from \nthe same political party.  5 U.S.C. § 1201; see also Humphrey’s \nExecutor,  295  U.S.  at  624  (“The  commission  is  to  be \nnonpartisan[.]”).  MSPB members serve staggered seven-year \nterms, giving each President the “opportunity to shape [the \nBoard’s] leadership and thereby influence its activities.”  Seila \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 72 of 114\n12 \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 225.  President Trump, in fact, will be able to \nappoint at least two of the MSPB’s three members.   \n \nIn  the  government’s  own  words,  the  MSPB  is \n“predominantly an adjudicatory body.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 12:19–\n23.  The MSPB has no investigatory or prosecutorial role.  \nInstead,  it  hears  disputes  between  federal  employees  and \nfederal agencies.  5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(a)(1), 7701(a).  As such, \nthe MSPB is passive and must wait for appeals to be initiated \neither by employees who have suffered an adverse employment \naction,  discrimination,  or  whistleblower  retaliation,  or  by \nemploying agencies or the Office of Special Counsel.  Id. \n§§ 1204(a)(1), 1214(b)(1)(a); 5 C.F.R. § 1201.3; see Seila Law, \n591  U.S.  at  219–220  (reiterating  the  constitutionality  of \nremoval protections for an officer who wielded “core executive \npower” because “that power, while significant, was trained \ninward  to  high-ranking  Governmental  actors  identified  by \nothers, and was confined to a specified matter in which the \nDepartment of Justice had a potential conflict of interest”).1   \n \nLike the War Claims Commission in Wiener, the MSPB \nmust  “‘adjudicate  according  to  law’  the  classes  of  claims \ndefined in the statute[.]”  357 U.S. at 355.  That confirms the \n“intrinsic judicial character of the task with which” the MSPB \nis “charged.”  Id. \n \n \n1 In the exercise of its adjudicatory authority, the MSPB has \nlimited jurisdiction.  Only civil servants that fall within the statutorily \ndefined  term  “employee”  can  seek  its  review.    5  U.S.C. \n§§ 7511(a)(1), 7701(a); see also Roy v. MSPB, 672 F.3d 1378, 1380 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012).  That definition excludes, among other categories, \npolitical appointees and civil servants in “probationary” or “trial \nperiod[s]” of employment.  5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1); see also Roche v. \nMSPB, 596 F.3d 1375, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 73 of 114\n13 \nThe history of the MSPB as a bifurcated entity reinforces \nits almost exclusively adjudicatory role.  In 1978, Congress \ndivided  the  Civil  Service  Commission  into  the  Office  of \nPersonnel Management and the MSPB.  Civil Service Reform \nAct of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 201, 92 Stat. 1111, 1119.  \nThe  Office  of  Personnel  Management  was  tasked  with \n“executing, administering, and enforcing * * * civil service \nrules and regulations[,]” while the MSPB—then, as now—was \ntasked with adjudicating disputes.  Id. § 202, 92 Stat. at 1122. \n \nOnce the MSPB issues decisions, federal agencies and \nemployees are expected to “comply” with its orders, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(a)(2), but the MSPB has no independent means of \nenforcing its orders.  Cf. Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at \n620–621 (FTC cease-and-desist orders could only be enforced \nby  application  “to  the  appropriate  Circuit  Court  of \nAppeals[.]”).  \n  \nIn addition, most MSPB decisions are subject to Article III \nreview.  Employees can appeal to federal court any decision \nthat “adversely affect[s] or aggrieve[s]” them, and the Director \nof the Office of Personnel Management can petition for judicial \nreview of any MSPB decision that the Director believes is \nerroneous and “will have a substantial impact on a civil service \nlaw,  rule,  regulation,  or  policy  directive.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 7703(a)(1), (d)(1). \n \nThe MSPB has limited rulemaking authority to prescribe \nonly those regulations “necessary for the performance of its \nfunctions,” many of which are akin to the federal rules of \nprocedure  and  local  rules  that  courts  adopt.    5  U.S.C. \n§ 1204(h); see,  e.g., 5  C.F.R. §§ 1201.14 (electronic filing \nprocedures),  1201.23  (computation  of  time  for  deadlines), \n1201.26 (service of pleadings).

In addition, \nthe MSPB remains accountable to the President and Congress \nthrough the appropriations process.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 118-\n47,  138  Stat.  557  (2024).    That  affords  the  President  an \n“opportunity to recommend or veto spending bills” to fund its \noperations.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 226. \n \n2 \n \nThe NLRB also fits the Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener \nmold.  Indeed, Congress enacted the National Labor Relations \nAct,  which  created  the  NLRB,  just  over  a  month  after \nHumphrey’s Executor was decided and modeled the statute on \nthe FTC’s organic statute.  Compare National Labor Relations \nAct, Pub. L. No. 74-198, 49 Stat. 449 (1935), with An Act to \ncreate a Federal Trade Commission, Pub. L. No. 63-203, 38 \nStat. 717 (1914); see also J. Warren Madden, Origin and Early \nYears of the National Labor Relations Act, 18 HASTINGS L.J. \n571, 572–573 (1967).   \n \nAs designed, the NLRB is a “multimember” agency that \ndoes “not wield substantial executive power[.]”  Seila Law, 591 \nU.S.  at  218.    It  is  composed  of  five  members  that  serve \nstaggered five-year terms, thus affording each President the \nchance to affect its composition.  29 U.S.C. § 153(a); see also \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  Though the Act does not require \nthe  Board’s  members  to  be  balanced  across  party  lines, \nPresidents since Eisenhower have adhered to a “tradition” of \nappointing no more than three members from their own party.  \nBrian D. Feinstein & Daniel J. Hemel, Partisan Balance with \nBite, 118 COLUM. L. REV. 9, 54–55 (2018).  No one disputes \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 75 of 114\n15 \nthat continues to be the case with the current Board of which \nWilcox is a member. \n \nThe NLRB is predominantly an adjudicatory body.  It hears \ncomplaints alleging unfair labor practices by employers and \nlabor  unions.    Glacier  Northwest  v.  International  Bhd.  of \nTeamsters Loc. Union No. 174, 598 U.S. 771, 775–776 (2023).  \nIt  can  issue  cease-and-desist  orders  aimed  at  unfair  labor \npractices and orders requiring reinstatement or backpay.  29 \nU.S.C. § 160(c).  These orders, however, are not independently \nenforceable.  They must be given legal force by a federal court \nof appeals.  Id. at §§ 154(a), 160(e); see also Dish Network \nCorp. v NLRB, 953 F.3d 370, 375 n.2 (5th Cir. 2020) (The \nNLRB  “needs  a  court’s  imprimatur  to  render  its  orders \nenforceable.”).  In addition, any person “aggrieved” by an \nNLRB decision may obtain judicial review in federal court.  29 \nU.S.C. § 160(f).   \n \nConspicuously absent from the NLRB’s authority is any \npower to investigate or prosecute cases.  That authority is left \nto the (removable-at-will) General Counsel.  See 29 U.S.C. \n§ 153(d).  So the NLRB’s powers are less than those of the FTC  \nin  Humphrey’s  Executor  because  the  FTC  could  launch \ninvestigations “at its own instance[.]”  Brief for Samuel F. \nRathbun, Executor, at 46 n.21, Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. \n602 (1935) (No. 667); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219 n.4 \n(“[W]hat matters” for assessing Humphrey’s Executor “is the \nset  of  powers  the  Court  considered  as  the  basis  for  its \ndecision[.]”).   \n \nLike the MSPB, the NLRB is funded through congressional \nappropriations. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 698 \n(2024).  Also like the MSPB, the NLRB has circumscribed \nrulemaking authority.  It can issue rules and regulations that are \nnecessary to carry out its statutory duties.  29 U.S.C. § 156.  As \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 76 of 114\n16 \npart of this authority, the NLRB may promulgate interpretive \nrules  “advis[ing]  the  public  of  [its]  construction”  of  the \nNational Labor Relations Act, Shalala v. Guernsey Mem’l \nHosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99 (1994) (citation omitted), but Article III \ncourts  review  those  interpretations  de  novo,  Loper  Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024). \n \nD \n \nAll of that makes the answer to the question whether the \ngovernment is likely to succeed in its appeal an easy “No.”  The \nunanimous holdings in Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener that \nremoval  restrictions  on  multimember,  non-partisan  bodies \nengaged  predominantly  in  adjudicatory  functions  are \nconstitutional bind this court, especially in light of the Supreme \nCourt’s repeated preservation of that precedent and Seila Law’s \nexpress invitation for Congress to change the CFPB into a \nmultimember body.   \n \nThe government and my colleagues’ opinions press two \ncentral arguments to escape this binding authority, but neither \naffords the government a likelihood of success on appeal. \n \n1 \n \nTo  start,  the  government  and  the  opinions  of  Judges \nHenderson and Walker try to distinguish the MSPB and NLRB \nfrom  the  multimember  agencies  at  issue  in  Humphrey’s \nExecutor and Wiener.  But those efforts do not work.   \n \nThe government casts the MSPB as exercising executive \nauthority  because  the  MSPB  “hear[s]”  and  “adjudicate[s]” \nmatters, is authorized to take “final action” on those matters, \n“issue[s]”  remedies,  and  orders  “compliance”  with  its \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 77 of 114\n17 \ndecisions.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 12 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(a)(1)–(2)).  \n \nTrue—the MSPB does do those things.  But those are the \nhallmarks  of  an  adjudicative  body.    The  War  Claims \nCommission was an “adjudicatory body[,]” and it issued final \nand unreviewable decisions that ordered funds to be paid from \nthe Treasury Department’s War Claims Fund.  Wiener, 357 \nU.S. at 354–356.  The decisions of the MSPB and NLRB, more \nmodestly, can only be enforced by a federal court.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 1204(a)(2), 7703 (MSPB); 29 U.S.C. § 160(e) (NLRB). \n \nThe government points out that the MSPB can invalidate \nrules issued by the Office of Personnel Management.  Gov’t \nStay Mot. in Harris 12 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1204(f)).  But the \nMSPB can invalidate only those rules that are themselves \ninherently unlawful because they would require employees to \nviolate the law by engaging in discriminatory, retaliatory, or \nother impermissible conduct.  5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(f)(2), 2302(b).  \nNeedless to say, that type of invalidation is an “exceedingly \nrare occurrence,” Harris Decl. ¶ 31, and could not trench upon \nany  lawful  exercise  of  the  President’s  duty  to  “faithfully \nexecute” the laws of the United States, U.S. CONST. Art. II, § 3.  \nAnd the government nowhere disclaims its ability to obtain \njudicial review of such a decision.  See generally 5 U.S.C. \n§ 7703(d)(1). \n \nThe government also highlights that MSPB attorneys, as \nopposed  to  lawyers  from  the  Department  of  Justice,  may \nrepresent the Board in civil actions in the lower federal courts.  \nGov’t Mot. in Harris 12 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1204(i)).  But that is \nalso true of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 U.S.C. § 248(p), and \nthe  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  whose  removal \nprotections the Supreme Court took as given as part of the \nconstitutional remedy adopted in Free Enterprise, 15 U.S.C. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 78 of 114\n18 \n§§ 77t(b)–(c),  78u(c)–(e).    Anyhow,  independent  litigating \nauthority is not uniquely executive in character.  The Political \nBranches have statutorily authorized the Senate Legal Counsel \nand the General Counsel of the House to represent the Senate \nand  House,  respectively,  in  court  proceedings.    2  U.S.C. \n§§ 288c, 5571(a). \n \nFinally,  Judge  Walker  claims  that  the  MSPB  wields \nexecutive power because “it can force the President to work \nwith thousands of employees he doesn’t want to work with[.]”  \nJ. Walker Op. 40–41.  The assertion that the President could \nfire every single employee in the Executive Branch, as opposed \nto principal officers, is a breathtaking broadside on the very \nexistence  of  a  civil  service  that  not  even  the  government \nadvances.    And  Judge  Walker  cites  no  authority  for  that \nproposition, which is odd given that the only issue before us is \nthe likelihood of the government’s success on appeal on the \narguments it advances.   \n \nAnyhow, his point proves the opposite.  Issuing an order \nthat an employee was unlawfully discharged is intrinsically \nadjudicative.  Federal courts often conclude that employment \ndischarges by the federal government were contrary to law and \norder employees reinstated.  See, e.g., Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 \nU.S. 535, 546 (1959) (reversing lower courts and ordering \nreinstatement of Department of Interior employee who was \nfired without procedurally proper notice or hearing); Lander v. \nLujan, 888 F.2d 153, 158 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (affirming district \ncourt order reinstating Bureau of Mines employee to position \nhe was demoted from in violation of Title VII); American \nPostal Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. United States Postal Serv., \n830 F.2d 294, 312 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (finding Postal Worker \ndischarged in violation of the First Amendment was entitled to \nreinstatement and back pay).   \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 79 of 114\n19 \nJudge Walker’s opinion also overlooks that the MSPB has \nno legal authority to “force” its decisions on anybody as it has \nno enforcement arm or sanctions to impose for noncompliance.  \nOnly a federal court can do that.  And even then, the decisions \nonly “force” the President to work with individuals whom the \nPresident  cannot  legally  fire  under  the  anti-discrimination, \nwhistleblower-protection, and veterans-preference laws that he \nhas sworn to uphold.  So just like the FTC, the MSPB’s charge \nis “the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law.”  \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.   \n \nAs for the NLRB, the government insists that the Board is \nnot  “hermetically  sealed”  off  from  the  General  Counsel’s \nenforcement functions.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 16.  In \nparticular,  the  government  argues  that  the  Board,  not  the \nGeneral Counsel, may seek injunctions against unfair labor \npractices in federal court.  Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 160(j)).  My \ncolleagues’ opinions likewise note that the NLRB can seek \nbackpay against private parties in federal court.  J. Walker Op. \n33–34; J. Henderson Op. 4. \n \nBut the Board’s power to seek injunctions in federal court \nmirrors the 1935 FTC’s power to “apply” to circuit courts for \n“enforcement”  of  cease-and-desist  orders.    Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 620–621.  In any event, the Board cannot \nact until the General Counsel does.  The Board may seek an \ninjunction only upon the “issuance of a complaint[,]” 29 U.S.C. \n§ 160(j), which the General Counsel has “final authority” to \nissue or not, id. § 153(d).  As for backpay, such equitable relief \nmust be sought by the General Counsel who alone supervises \nthe attorneys representing the NLRB in federal court.  Id.   \n \nLastly,  Judge  Walker’s  opinion  says  that  having  an \nintrinsically  adjudicatory  function  like  the  War  Claims \nCommission  in  Wiener  does  not  count  because  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 80 of 114\n20 \nCommission’s work was “temporary.”  J. Walker Op. 40.  The \nopinion  nowhere  explains  why  the  length  of  an  agency’s \nmandate matters constitutionally.  If Congress established an \nagency to run the military, gave its directors for-cause removal \nprotection, but limited its operation to two years, that agency \nwould trench on the President’s Article II authority far more \nthan the NLRB or MSPB ever could.  In any event, if time \nmatters, Harris’s and Wilcox’s remaining tenures in office \nwould be shorter than those of the War Claims Commissioners.  \nSee War Claims Act of 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-896, § 2(a), (c)–\n(d), 62 Stat. 1240, 1241 (The War Claims Commissioners were \noriginally authorized to serve up to five-year terms). \n \nIn  short,  none  of  the  government’s  arguments  or  my \ncolleagues’ opinions distinguish the MSPB or NLRB in any \nmaterially relevant way from the Supreme Court’s holdings in \nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener.   \n \n2 \n \na \n \nAs their second tack, the government and my colleagues’ \nopinions take aim at Humphrey’s Executor.  The government \nsays that decision has effectively been overruled and confined \nto its facts because its conclusion about the nature of the FTC’s \nexecutive power “has not withstood the test of time.”  Gov’t \nStay Mot. in Harris 15 (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216 n.2); \nsee also Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 14.   \n \nThe Supreme Court expressly rejected this argument in \nMorrison.    See  Morrison,  487  U.S.  at  686–691,  689  n.28 \n(applying Humphrey’s Executor even though the “powers of \nthe FTC at the time of Humphrey’s Executor would at the \npresent  time  be  considered  ‘executive,’  at  least  to  some \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 81 of 114\n21 \ndegree”).  That ruling binds this court.  Plus that argument has \nnothing to say about the controlling force of Wiener, which \ninvolved a predominantly adjudicatory body much more akin \nto the NLRB and MSPB.   \n \nIt is this court’s job to apply Supreme Court precedent, not \nto cast it aside or to declare it on “jurisprudential life support.”  \nJ. Walker Op. 26.  If a precedent of the Supreme Court “has \ndirect application in a case”—as Humphrey’s Executor and \nWiener do here—“a lower court ‘should follow the case which \ndirectly  controls,’”  leaving  to  the  Supreme  Court  “‘the \nprerogative  of  overruling  its  own  decisions.’”  Mallory  v. \nNorfolk  S.  Ry.  Co.,  600  U.S.  122,  136  (2023)  (quoting \nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 \nU.S. 477, 484 (1989)).   \n \nImportantly, that rule governs “even if the lower court \nthinks the precedent is in tension with ‘some other line of \ndecisions.’”  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 (quoting Rodriguez de \nQuijas, 490 U.S. at 484); see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. \n203, 237 (1997) (“We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, \nthat other courts should conclude our more recent cases have, \nby  implication,  overruled  an  earlier  precedent.”);  National \nSecurity Archive v. CIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. \n2024) (“This Court is charged with following case law that \ndirectly controls a particular issue[.]”).2   \n \nYet “tension” is the most that the government and my \ncolleagues’  opinions  can  claim.    The  government  frankly \nadmits it.  At oral argument, the government, with admirable \n \n2 See also Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 54 (D.C.

Cir. 2003) (quoting Rodriquez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at \n484). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 82 of 114\n22 \ncandor, acknowledged no less than four times that it believes \nthe constitutionality of removal protections for multimember \nbodies is not “clear.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 24:25; see id. at 10:24–11:5 \n(“[T]he Supreme Court has left the lower courts in something \nof a tough spot[.]”); 84:16–23 (There is, “at a minimum, a very \nsubstantial question” and “reasonable minds can differ” about \nthe  scope  of  Humphrey’s  Executor  today.);  88:17–18 \n(“[T]here’s some uncertainty” in the wake of Collins.).   \n \nJudge  Henderson  agrees  that  it  is  “unclear”  when  the \nHumphrey’s Executor rule for multimember boards applies, J. \nHenderson Op. 1, and that “reasonable minds can—and often \ndo—disagree”  about  how  to  apply  the  Supreme  Court’s \nprecedent, id. at 3.  \n \nThe reason for that lack of clarity is obvious:  The Supreme \nCourt  has  not  overruled  Humphrey’s  Executor  or  Wiener.  \nQuite the opposite, it has expressly carved out multimember \nindependent boards from its recent holdings on the removal \npower  and  has  expressly  left  Humphrey’s  Executor  “in \nplace[.]”    Seila  Law,  591  U.S.  at  215.    That  is  why  the \nconcurring opinion of Justices Thomas and Gorsuch in Seila \nLaw exists at all:  They write to say that they would have gone \nfurther than the Court and struck down Humphrey’s Executor.  \nId. at 238–239 (Thomas, J., joined by Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin part and dissenting in part).  So Judge Walker cannot cite a \nsingle Supreme Court case saying that the Court has effectively \noverruled Humphrey’s Executor or confined that opinion to its \nfacts, never to be applied again.  See J. Walker Op. 30.   \n \nJudge  Walker’s  opinion,  instead,  presumes  to  do  the \nSupreme Court’s job for it.  After omitting what the Supreme \nCourt  actually  said  about  Humphrey’s  Executor  in  Free \nEnterprise, Seila Law, and Collins, Judge Walker discerns a \nclarity that everyone  else has missed,  announcing that the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 83 of 114\n23 \nSupreme Court has imposed “a binding command on the lower \ncourts”  not  to  extend  Humphrey’s  Executor  to  “any  new \ncontexts,” so that this court “cannot extend Humphrey’s—not \neven an inch.”  J. Walker Op. 30. \n \nThe problem?  The opinion never cites to Supreme Court \nlanguage for that “binding obligation,” nor does it quote or cite \nanything for the proposed requirement that any multimember \nboard must be an “identical twin” to the FTC to be sustained.   \n \nThat is because the Supreme Court has not said either thing.   \nRather than take the Supreme Court at its word, Judge Walker’s \nopinion  prognosticates  that  the  Supreme  Court  will  in  the \nfuture invalidate all removal protections for all multimember \nboards that exercise “any” executive power in any form.  J. \nWalker Op. 36.   \n \nBut that is the very job the Supreme Court has forbidden us \nto undertake.  We are to apply controlling precedent, not play \njurisprudential weather forecasters.  To do otherwise would be \nto accuse the Supreme Court of not meaning what it said when \nit  repeatedly  left  Humphrey’s  Executor  in  place,  and  of \nengaging  in  a  disingenuous  bait-and-switch  when  seven \nJustices openly invited Congress to repair the constitutional \nflaw in the CFPB by reconstituting it as a multimember body.  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 237 (Roberts, C.J., joined by Alito and \nKavanaugh, JJ., concurring in the judgment); id. at 298 (Kagan, \nJ., joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., concurring \nin the judgment with respect to severability and dissenting in \npart).  \n \nGetting out ahead of the Supreme Court that way is beyond \nmy pay grade.  When the Supreme Court makes and expressly \npreserves precedent, “we [should] take its assurances seriously.  \nIf the Justices [were] just pulling our leg, let them say so.”  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 84 of 114\n24 \nSherman v.

Cir. \n2023) (“[C]arefully considered language of the Supreme Court, \neven  if  technically  dictum,  generally  must  be  treated  as \nauthoritative.”) (citation omitted). \n \nStaying in our lane is even more vital in deciding a motion \nto stay.  A stay pending appeal, like a preliminary injunction, \nis meant to be a “stopgap measure[,]” made under “conditions \nof grave uncertainty” and with the awareness that it may prove \nto be “mistaken” once the merits are decided.  Singh v. Berger, \n56 F.4th 88, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted).  It is not an \nopportunity to effect a sea change in the law—especially one \nthat the Supreme Court itself has repeatedly forborne.   \n \nb \n \nAs if Supreme Court precedent was not enough to find that \nthe  government  is  not  likely  to  succeed  in  these  appeals, \nbinding circuit precedent doubles down on it.  Prior circuit \nopinions are “of course binding on us under the law-of-the-\ncircuit doctrine.”  Palmer v. FAA, 103 F.4th 798, 806 (D.C. Cir. \n2024); Campaign Legal Ctr. v. 45Committee, Inc., 118 F.4th \n378, 386 n.* (D.C.

Barry, 87 \nF.3d 1389, 1395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc)). \n \nThis court has repeatedly applied Humphrey’s Executor as \nprecedent, including as recently as the last two years.

Mar. 3, 2025) (“Humphrey’s Executor \nremains binding today.”) (quoting Leachco, 103 F.4th at 761).   \n \nIn sum, this court’s duty—especially at this early stay \nstage—is to follow binding and dispositive Supreme Court and \ncircuit precedent in evaluating the government’s likelihood of \nsuccess.  And the government has not shown any likelihood of \nprevailing under Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener, as well as \ncircuit precedent.  If the government thinks it has a likelihood \nof success on certiorari to the Supreme Court, it can raise that \nargument there.  This court has no business getting ahead of \nthat Court in these appeals.  And we certainly should not cast \noff Supreme Court precedent, depart from circuit precedent, \nand create a circuit conflict just to determine the government’s \neligibility for a stay that is meant only to maintain the status \nquo. \n \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 86 of 114\n26 \nE \n \nEven if Supreme Court precedent did not dictate the answer \nto the likelihood-of-success question, the government’s and my \ncolleagues’ efforts in their opinions to reduce Humphrey’s \nExecutor and Wiener to constitutional rubble are not likely to \nsucceed.   \n \n1 \n \nThis court’s starting point is to presume that the Civil \nService Reform Act and the National Labor Relations Act are \nconstitutional.  United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. 445, 463 n.6 \n(2019); Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality v. \nE.P.A., 790 F.3d 138, 182 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  And with or \nwithout  that  presumption,  the  statutory  removal  provisions \npass constitutional muster.   \n \nTo  start,  the  removal  restrictions  comport  with  the \nConstitution’s text.  Article I gives Congress the full authority \nto  create  agencies  and  the  officer  positions  to  run  those \nagencies.  U.S. CONST. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18 (“The Congress shall \nhave Power * * * To make all Laws which shall be necessary \nand proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, \nand  all  other  Powers  vested  by  this  Constitution  in  the \nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or \nOfficer thereof.”).  The Constitution also makes explicit that \nCongress, and not just the President, has a role in staffing the \nagencies and positions created by law.  Under Article II’s \nAppointments  Clause,  the  President  can  appoint  principal \nofficers only “by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate” and only as the legislature “shall * * * establish[] by \nLaw” those positions.  Art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  Congress also has \nplenary power to vest the appointment of inferior officers “in \nthe President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 87 of 114\n27 \nDepartments.”  Id.  And, of course, it is Congress who pays, \nwith taxpayer dollars, for everyone employed in the Executive \nBranch.  Art. I, § 8, cl. 1.    \n \nArticle II, for its part, says nothing about removal power.  \nBut it does vest in the President “[t]he executive Power” and \ncharge the President with “tak[ing] Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed[.]”  U.S. CONST. Art. II, §§ 1, 3.  Read \ntogether,  the  Constitution  invests  both  the  President  and \nCongress with coordinate responsibilities to build an effective \nand efficient government that serves the Nation’s important \ninterests.   \n \nHistory confirms that Congress may, as part of its design \nand  staffing  decisions,  condition  the  President’s  removal \nauthority when necessary to accomplish vital national goals.  \nCongressional authority to enact for-cause removal restrictions \ntraces back to the time of the Constitution’s adoption.  When \nCongress reenacted the Northwest Ordinance, it transferred the \nConfederation Congress’s removal authority over territorial \nofficials to the President, An Act to provide for the Government \nof the Territory Northwest of the river Ohio, ch. 8, § 1, 1 Stat. \n50,  53  (Aug.  7,  1789),  but  left  intact  for-cause  removal \nprotections for territorial judges, id. at 51.3   \n \nThen,  in  1790,  Congress  created  the  Sinking  Fund \nCommission  (the  Federal  Reserve’s  early  predecessor)  to \nperform economically critical executive and policy functions.  \nCongress  directed  that  two  of  its  five  directors  would  be \nofficials whom the President could not remove.  An Act making \n \n3  Territorial  judges  do  not  constitutionally  enjoy  tenure \nprotection  because  they  are  not  Article  III  judges.    American \nInsurance Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S. 511, 546 (1828).  \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 88 of 114\n28 \nprovision for the reduction of the Public Debt, ch. 47, § 2, 1 \nStat. 186 (1790).  As for the First and Second Banks of the \nUnited States, Congress provided the President no removal \nauthority  over  members  of  the  First  Bank,  An  act  to \nincorporate the subscribers in the Bank of the United States, \nch. 10, § 4, 1 Stat. 191, 192–193 (1791), and gave the President \ncontrol  over  only  five  out  of  twenty-five  members  of  the \nSecond Bank, An Act to incorporate the subscribers to the \nBank of the United States, ch. 44, § 8, 3 Stat. 266, 269 (1816).4   \n \nNext, in 1855, Congress created the Court of Claims, the \njudges of which held office “during good behaviour,” An Act \nto establish a Court for the Investigation of Claims against the \nUnited States, ch. 22, § 1, 10 Stat. 612 (1855), even though they \nwere not Article III judges, see Williams v. United States, 289 \nU.S. 553, 563 (1933).   \n \nThe list goes on.  The statute creating the Comptroller of \nthe Currency required the President to gain Senate approval \nbefore removing the Comptroller, An Act to provide a national \nCurrency,  ch.  58,  § 1,  12  Stat.  665–666  (1863),  and  its \nsuccessor  statute,  while  vesting  removal  authority  in  the \nPresident, still required the President to “communicate[]” his \nreason “to the Senate” before exercising that authority, An Act \n \n4 Judge Walker’s opinion makes much of the Decision of 1789.  \nSee J. Walker Op. 9–10.  But the only thing decided in 1789 was that \nthe  President  need  not  always  consult  with  the  Senate  before \nremoving a principal officer, a proposition that no one contests today.  \nE.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 241 (1926) (Brandeis, J., \ndissenting).  Rather than focusing on short snippets from legislative \ndebates and law review articles, one can simply observe that the same \nCongress that apparently decided against removal restrictions also \ndecided to create removal restrictions, just not for every principal \nofficer. \n  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 89 of 114\n29 \nto provide a National Currency, ch. 106, § 1, 13 Stat. 100 \n(1864). \n \nThen, in 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce \nCommission to regulate railroads.  Neither President Cleveland \nnor  a  single  member  of  Congress  raised  a  constitutional \nobjection  to  the  provision  allowing  the  removal  of \nCommissioners  only  “for  inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office[.]”  An act to regulate commerce, ch. \n104, § 11, 24 Stat. 383 (1887). \n \nFounding-era  Supreme  Court  precedent  documents  the \npractice as well.  In Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) \n137  (1803),  the  Supreme  Court,  through  Chief  Justice \nMarshall,  recognized  that  some  executive  officers  are  not \nremovable by the President:   \n \nWhere  an  officer  is  removable  at  the  will  of  the \nexecutive,  the  circumstance  which  completes  his \nappointment is of no concern; because the act is at any \ntime revocable; and the commission may be arrested, \nif still in the office.  But when the officer is not \nremovable  at  the  will  of  the  executive,  the \nappointment is not revocable, and cannot be annulled.  \nIt has conferred legal rights which cannot be resumed.   \n \nId.  at  162;  see  also  id.  at  172–173  (Marbury  “has  been \nappointed to an office, from which he is not removable, at the \nwill of the executive; and being so appointed, he has a right to \nthe commission which the secretary has received from the \npresident for his use.”).5   \n \n5 To be sure, the Supreme Court in dicta has dismissed this \ndiscussion in Marbury as “ill-considered dicta.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 90 of 114\n30 \n \nNone of this is surprising given the Constitution’s textual \nchecking and balancing, and general opposition to the over-\nconcentration of power in a single Branch.  As Justice Scalia \nsummarized when discussing the modern counterparts of these \nearly  agencies,  “removal  restrictions  have  been  generally \nregarded  as  lawful  for  so-called  ‘independent  regulatory \nagencies,’ such as the Federal Trade Commission, * * * the \nInterstate Commerce Commission, * * *, and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission * * *, which engage substantially \nin  what  has  been  called  the  ‘quasi-legislative  activity’  of \nrulemaking[.]”  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 724–725 (Scalia, J., \ndissenting).  Such “‘long settled and established practice is a \nconsideration of great  weight in a proper interpretation of \nconstitutional provisions’ regulating the relationship between \nCongress and the President.”  NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. \n513, 524 (2014) (quoting The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655, \n689 (1929)). \n \n \nat 227.  But it seems to me to be wisdom and knowledge gained from \nfirsthand experience at the time of the founding, and so cannot be \nbrushed away so easily.  John Marshall participated in the Virginia \nratification  debates  and  served  in  the  legislative  and  executive \nbranches  before  becoming  Chief  Justice.    See  Supreme  Court \nHistorical  Society,  Life  Story:    John  Marshall  (2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/JHA4-EPTH.  He was joined by Justice Paterson, a \ndelegate to the Constitutional Convention and a Senator in 1789, \nwhen the debate over removal took place.  See Supreme Court \nHistorical  Society,  William  Paterson  (2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/TL6M-7Y9M.  In searching for the Constitution’s \noriginal meaning, it is hard to understand the preference of Judge \nWalker’s  opinion  for  Myers—written  138  years  after  the \nConstitution’s  ratification—to  Marbury,  written  by  jurists  who \nhelped to write and to ratify the Constitution. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 91 of 114\n31 \nThat is the historical grounding for the Supreme Court’s \ndecisions  in  Humphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener.  And  the \nMSPB’s and NLRB’s for-cause removal protections fit that \nhistorical practice.   \n \na \n \nStart with the MSPB.  In 1883, Congress created the Civil \nService  Commission—the  MSPB’s  predecessor  entity—to \naddress the serious problem of a federal workforce beset by \npolitical  patronage,  political  coercion,  and  instability.  \nPresidents and their subordinates could reward their supporters \nwith taxpayer-funded government jobs, but often had to fire \nthose already in office to make room for their favorites.  The \nresult was administrative dysfunction.  As one commentator \nput  it,  “[a]t  present  there  is  no  organization  save  that  of \ncorruption[;] * * * no system save that of chaos; no test of \nintegrity save that of partisanship; no test of qualification save \nthat of intrigue.”  Ari Hoogenboom, The Pendleton Act and the \nCivil Service, 64 AM. HIST. REV. 301, 301 (1959) (quoting \nJulius Bing, Our Civil Service, PUTNAM’S MAG. 232, 236 (Aug. \n1868)); see id. at 302 (“Contemporaries noted the cloud of fear \nthat  hovered  over  government  workers,  especially  after  a \nchange of administration.  It was impossible for an esprit de \ncorps  or  for  loyalty  to  office  or  agency  to  develop  in  an \natmosphere of nervous tension. * * *  A civil servant was loyal \nprimarily to his patron—the local political who procured him \nhis job.”).   \n \nConcerns about this patronage system were a longstanding \nconcern.  As Mark Twain observed:  “Unless you can get the \near of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of a Bureau or \nDepartment, and persuade him to use his ‘influence’ in your \nbehalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature \nin Washington.  Mere merit, fitness and capability[] are useless \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 92 of 114\n32 \nbaggage  to  you  without  ‘influence.’”    MARK  TWAIN  & \nCHARLES WARNER, THE GILDED AGE 223 (1873); see also \nMark Twain, Special Dispatch, N.Y. Times (Oct. 2, 1876) (“We \nhope and expect to sever [the civil] service as utterly from \npolitics as is the naval and military service, and we hope to \nmake it as respectable, too.  We hope to make worth and \ncapacity the sole requirements of the civil service[.]”). \n \nGovernmental malfunction was so disabling that President \nGarfield devoted a portion of his 1881 inaugural address to the \nproblem.    He  emphasized  the  need  for  tenure  protections, \nexplaining that the civil service could “never be placed on a \nsatisfactory basis until it is regulated by law[s]” that “prescribe \nthe grounds upon which removals shall be made during the \nterms for which incumbents have been appointed.”  President \nJames  A.  Garfield,  Inaugural  Address  (March  4,  1881), \nhttps://perma.cc/B5DM-T738.    President  Garfield’s \nassassination a few months later by a disappointed job seeker \ntransformed  concerns  about  the  patronage  system  into  a \nnational crisis.  Alan Gephardt, The Federal Civil Service and \nthe  Death  of  President  James  A.  Garfield,  National  Park \nService (2012), https://perma.cc/3QY2-LEUT. \n \nTwo years later, “strong discontent with the corruption and \ninefficiency of the patronage system of public employment \neventuated in the Pendleton Act, [ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403 (1883)].”  \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 354 (1976).  That Act created a \nCivil Service Commission to eliminate the “patronage system” \nof governance and create a professional civil service dedicated \nonly to working for the American people.  Id.  In that way, \n“Congress, the Executive, and the country” all agreed “that \npartisan  political  activities  by  federal  employees  must  be \nlimited if the Government is to operate effectively and fairly[.]”  \nUnited States Civil Service Comm’n v. National Association of \nLetter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 413 U.S. 548, 564 (1973).   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 93 of 114\n33 \n \nThe  MSPB’s  raison  d’etre  is  to  effectuate  this \ngovernmental commitment to prioritizing merit over partisan \nloyalty.  Housing all employment matters in the Civil Service \nCommission had proven unworkable as the Commission had \naccumulated “conflicting responsibilities” in its roles as “a \nmanager, rulemaker, prosecutor and judge.”  President Jimmy \nCarter,  Fed.  Civ.  Serv.  Reform  Msg.  to  Cong.  (March  2, \n1978), https://perma.cc/2URA-FJRR.  Its  slow  pace  of \ndecision-making had also confounded efforts to enforce civil \nservice laws for both employees and employing agencies.  See \nUnited States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 458 (1988) (Stevens, J., \ndissenting).   \n \nTo address the problem, the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act \ncreated  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  to  perform \n“personnel administration[,]” the Office of Special Counsel to \n“investigate  and  prosecute[,]”  and  the  MSPB  to  “be  the \nadjudicatory arm of the new personnel system.”  President \nCarter, Fed. Civ. Serv. Reform Msg.; see Civil Service Reform \nAct of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 3, 92 Stat. 1111, 1112 (The \nAct  will  provide  “the  people  of  the  United  States  with  a \ncompetent, honest, and productive Federal work force” that is \ngoverned by “merit system principles and free from prohibited \npersonnel practices[.]”). \n \nThe  Reform  Act  provided  MSPB  members  with  some \nremoval protection to ensure both employees and agencies that \ndecisions would be made based on the facts and law, rather than \npolitical allegiance or fear of retribution.  The MSPB also hears \nclaims by whistleblowers exposing waste, fraud, and abuse \nwithin  federal  agencies.    Removal  protections  offer \nwhistleblowers  assurance  that  their  claims  will  be  heard \nimpartially  and  objectively,  free  from  retributive  political \npressure.  For “it is quite evident that one who holds his office \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 94 of 114\n34 \nonly during the pleasure of another cannot be depended upon \nto maintain an attitude of independence against the latter’s \nwill.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.   \n \nSaid  another  way,  if  the  Constitution  requires  that \nPresidents be allowed to fire members of the Merit Systems \nProtection Board for any partisan, policy, or personal reason, \nthen Congress and the taxpayers cannot have a professional \ncivil service based on merit.  Nor could the MSPB provide the \n“requirement of neutrality in adjudicative proceedings” that \n“safeguards  the  * * *  central  concerns  of  procedural  due \nprocess[.]”  Marshall v. Jericco, 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980); see \nSchweiker  v.  McClure,  456  U.S.  188,  195  (1982)  (“[D]ue \nprocess demands impartiality on the part of those who function \nin judicial or quasi-judicial capacities.”).   \n \nAt the same time, by housing the adjudicatory authority in \na multimember board, the Political Branches prevented the \naccumulation of power in the hands of a single individual \nanswerable to no one.  Cf. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 222–226; \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 \n(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (“[T]he Constitution diffuses \npower the better to secure liberty[.]”).  The group decision-\nmaking dynamic of the collective Board also helps to ensure \nthat members can and will ground their decisions in the law and \nfacts  alone,  which  they  have  to  justify  in  their  judicially \nreviewable written decisions.  That is, they have to show their \nwork.    The  requirement  of  a  politically  balanced  Board \ndemonstrates the Political Branches’ bipartisan commitment to \ncreating a neutral and unbiased adjudicatory process.  That \ncontrasts sharply with the single heads of agencies in Seila Law \nand Collins, who were accountable to no one and did not need \nto be appointed in a politically neutral manner.   \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 95 of 114\n35 \nPresumably that balance is why, over the last 50 years and \neight  presidential  administrations,  there  has  been  nary  a \nconstitutional objection in a presidential signing statement or \nOffice  of  Legal  Counsel  opinion  to  the  MSPB’s  removal \nrestrictions.  Quite the opposite.  Shortly before passage of the \nReform Act, the Office of Legal Counsel agreed that the MSPB \nwas “a quasi-judicial body whose officials may be legitimately \nexempted  from  removal  at  the  pleasure  of  the  President.”  \nPresidential Appointees—Removal Power—Civil Serv. Reform \nAct-Const. L. (Article II, S 2, Cl. 2), 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 121 \n(1978).6  \n \n6 The government’s briefs and Judge Henderson’s and Judge \nWalker’s opinions cite nothing at all.  The most I have found is that \nPresidents George H. Bush and Clinton noted different potential \nconstitutional problems related to the MSPB with the Whistleblower \nProtection Act of 1989 and MSPB Reauthorization Act of 1994, \nrespectively, but those had nothing to do with constitutional concerns \nabout  removal  protections  for  MSPB  members.

Moreover,  to  my \nknowledge, neither OLC nor any President in a signing statement has \ncalled into doubt Humphrey’s Executor or Wiener or suggested that \nthose opinions have lost their validity.  This stands in sharp contrast \nto removal restrictions on the four modern single-head agencies \nwhose constitutionality was questioned from the outset.  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 221 (The Office of Special Counsel was the “first \nenduring single-leader office, created nearly 200 years after the \nConstitution  was  ratified,  [and]  drew  a  contemporaneous \nconstitutional objection from the Office of Legal Counsel under \nPresident Carter and a subsequent veto on constitutional grounds by \nPresident  Reagan.”);  Collins,  594  U.S.  at  251  (These  agencies \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 96 of 114\n36 \n \nb \n \nThe critical national need for an impartial, multimember \nadjudicatory process applies with at least equal force to the \nNLRB.  Before its creation, the United States was racked by \nviolent  labor  strikes  and  brutal  repression  of  the  strikers.  \nBetween 1877 and 1934, there were thousands of violent labor \ndisputes, many of which required state and federal troops to \ncontrol.

In \n1934 alone, the National Guard had to be mobilized to quell \nstrikes in Minnesota, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South \nCarolina and California.  Id. at 269–272.  In addition to the \nhuman toll of the many killed and wounded, the economic costs \nwere staggering: “the vacating of 1,745,000 jobs,” the “loss of \n50,242,000 working days every 12 months,” and a cost to the \neconomy of “at least $1,000,000,000 per year” in 1934 dollars, \nwhich would be approximately $23.5 billion per year now.

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. \n1, 42 (1937).   \n \nImportantly, federal and state courts had proven unable to \nresolve these conflicts.  See FELIX FRANKFURTER & NATHAN \nGREENE, THE LABOR INJUNCTION (1930); HOWARD GILLMAN, \nTHE CONSTITUTION BESIEGED 61–100 (1995).  That is why \nCongress created the NLRB—an expert agency capable of \nfacilitating  “negotiation”  and  “promot[ing]  [the]  industrial \npeace[.]”  Jones & Laughlin, 301 U.S. at 45.  “Everyday \nexperience  in  the  administration  of  the  [National  Labor \nRelations  Act]  gives  [the  NLRB]  familiarity  with  the \ncircumstances and backgrounds of employment relationships \nin various industries, with the abilities and needs of the workers \nfor  self  organization  and  collective  action,  and  with  the \nadaptability of collective bargaining for the peaceful settlement \nof  their  disputes  with  their  employers.”    NLRB  v.  Hearst \nPublications, 322 U.S. 111, 130 (1944).   \n \nAs with the MSPB, the Political Branches concluded that \nthe neutrality of Board members would be indispensable to \ntheir vital role, so they had to be kept free from both the \nperception and the reality of direct political influence that an \nunalloyed removal power would permit.  With “the Damocles’ \nsword of removal by the President” hanging over the NLRB, \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 356, employers and labor would lose faith \nthat the NRLB is impartially administering the law rather than \ntacking to ever-changing political winds.  \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 98 of 114\n38 \nIn addition, an unchecked removal power would cause \nfrequent and sharp changes in how the NLRB adjudicates \ncases.  That lack of stability in the law would make it harder \nfor businesses and labor to enter into agreements to resolve \nlabor disputes.  One party might prefer to wait for the next \nelection  before  committing  to  a  collective  bargaining \nagreement.  Or those agreements could be shortened to mirror \nthe terms of politically replaceable Board members.  Both \nwould spawn more breakdowns in labor relations, strikes, and \neconomic  disruption.    See  International  Organization  of \nMasters, Mates & Pilots, ILA, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 61 F.4th 169, \n180 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (discussing the importance of consistent \npolicymaking to protect and encourage reliance interests).  \n  \nNinety years after the NLRA, it may be hard to imagine the \nexceptional disruption to the national economy caused by the \nabsence of an impartial and expert administrative forum for the \nresolution of labor disputes.  But that is because the NLRB has \nworked.  National Report on Labor Violence at 292 (“The \nsharp decline in the level of industrial violence is one of the \ngreat achievements of the National Labor Relations Board.”).  \nAnd it is the indispensability of a neutral adjudicator between \nlabor and employers that explains why the Supreme Court has \nsaid  directly  that  the  NLRB  does  not  “offend  against  the \nconstitutional requirements governing the creation and action \nof administrative bodies.”  Jones & Laughlin, 301 U.S. at 46–\n47. \n \n2 \n \nIn  response  to  the  Political  Branches’  joint  and \nlongstanding  conclusions  as  to  the  critical  necessity  for  a \nprofessional civil service and a neutral adjudicatory forum to \nobtain  industrial  peace  in  the  national  economy,  the \ngovernment and Judge Walker’s opinion blow a one-note horn:  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 99 of 114\n39 \naccountability.  J. Walker Op. 1, 7, 21–22; Gov’t Stay Mot. in \nHarris 10, 13; Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 9, 12.  \n \nBut  accountability  remains.    Harris  and  Wilcox  were \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  S. \nRoll Call Vote No. 209, 117th Cong., 2d Sess. (2022) (Harris); \nS. Roll Call Vote No. 216, 118th Cong., 1st Sess. (2023) \n(Wilcox).  They must leave office when their terms of seven \nand five years respectively end.  5 U.S.C. § 1202(a) (Harris); \n29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (Wilcox).  In the interim, the President can \nremove them for cause if they fail to “faithfully execute[]” the \nlaw, as well as for basic incompetence.  U.S. CONST. Art. II, \n§ 3;  see  5  U.S.C.  § 1202(d)  (Harris);  29  U.S.C.  § 153(a) \n(Wilcox).  This alone gives the President “ample authority” to \nensure  they  are  “competently  performing  [their]  statutory \nresponsibilities[.]”  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 692; see also Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 509 (With “a single level of good-\ncause tenure” between the President and the Board, “[t]he \nCommission is then fully responsible for the Board’s actions, \nwhich are no less subject than the Commission’s own functions \nto Presidential oversight.”).  On top of this, Congress can \neliminate  their  offices  completely.    U.S.  CONST.  Art.  I, \n§ 8.  The public can comment on their policies.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(c).  And they must regularly send reports to the President \nand  Congress.    Id.  § 1206  (Harris);  29  U.S.C.  § 153(c) \n(Wilcox).  Just because a President cannot fire Harris and \nWilcox for no reason or because he does not like their rulings \ndoes not mean that they wield unchecked and unaccountable \nauthority. \n \nBeyond that, the suggestion in Judge Walker’s opinion that \nelectoral accountability is the Constitution’s lodestar for the \nexecutive branch is misplaced.  See J. Walker Op. 48 (“The \npeople elected the President, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute \nthe nation’s laws.”) (emphases added).  But there are other \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 100 of 114\n40 \nvalues at stake—stability, competence, experience, efficiency, \nenergy, and prudence, for example.  Anyhow, the members of \nCongress  who  created  the  MSPB  and  NLRB  are  directly \nelected by the people who are affected by the competence and \nstability of the federal civil service and labor disruptions.  By \ncontrast, Americans do not directly elect the President.  Instead, \nthey vote for delegates to the electoral college who cast votes \nfor  the  President.    See  U.S.  CONST.  Amend.  XII.    This \nprocedure  was  not  designed  to  maximize  popular \naccountability.    See  THE  FEDERALIST  NO.  68  (Alexander \nHamilton)  (“It  was  equally  desirable,  that  the  immediate \nelection should be made by men most capable of analyzing the \nqualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances \nfavorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all \nthe reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their \nchoice.  A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-\ncitizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess \nthe information and discernment requisite to such complicated \ninvestigations.”).  To the extent that Judge Walker’s opinion’s \ndescription of the presidency appears familiar, it is because it \ndescribes the presidency circa 2025, not circa 1788 when the \nConstitution was adopted and the roles of Congress and the \nPresident in designing the government were formulated. \n \n* * * * * \n \nIn  short,  this  Nation’s  historical  practice  of  removal \nrestrictions on multimember boards combined with the acute \nneed for impartial adjudicatory bodies to give effect to civil \nservice protections and to provide labor peace and stability \ntogether demonstrate the constitutional permissibility of the \nremoval limitations for members of these two adjudicatory \nbodies.  Such a “systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long \npursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before \nquestioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 101 of 114\n41 \nuphold the Constitution, making as it were such exercise of \npower part of the structure of our government, may be treated \nas a gloss on ‘executive Power’ vested in the President by § 1 \nof Art. II.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U.S. at 610–\n611 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).   \n \nFor  all  those  reasons,  at  this  procedural  juncture,  the \ngovernment  is  not  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  its \nargument that the removal provisions are unconstitutional even \nif binding Supreme Court and circuit precedent did not already \nresolve the likelihood of success question in favor of Harris and \nWilcox. \n \nF \n \nThe government additionally has failed to demonstrate a \nlikelihood of success on its argument that this court cannot \nremedy Harris’s and Wilcox’s injuries.  “The very essence of \ncivil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to \nclaim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an \ninjury.”  Marbury, 5 U.S. at 163.  And it is “indisputable” that \nthe wrongful removal from office constitutes “a cognizable \ninjury[.]”  Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042; see Sampson v. Murray, \n415 U.S. 61, 91 (1974); Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356 (permitting \nsuit for damages).  Indeed, the government acknowledges that \nHarris and Wilcox have remediable injuries.  Gov’t. Stay Mot. \nin Harris 18; Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Wilcox 19.   \n \nFour remedies are available in this context, should the \ndistrict court judgments in favor of Harris and Wilcox be \nsustained on appeal. \n \nFirst, there is no dispute that Harris and Wilcox could \nobtain backpay due to an unlawful firing if their wages have \nbeen disrupted.  See, e.g., Myers, 272 U.S. at 106. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 102 of 114\n42 \n \nSecond, federal courts may preserve in office or reinstate \nsomeone fired from the Executive Branch with an injunction if \nthe circumstances are “extraordinary.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at \n92 n.68; see Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 388 (1957).  The \nplaintiff must demonstrate “irreparable injury sufficient in kind \nand  degree  to  override”  the  “disruptive  effect”  to  “the \nadministrative process[.]”  Sampson, 354 U.S. at 83–84; see id. \nat 92 n.68.   \n \nThis  rule  extends  to  officers  who  hold  positions  on \nmultimember  boards.    Even  though  an  injunction  cannot \nrestore  such  officeholders  to  office  de  jure,  this  court’s \nprecedent holds that a court can order their restoration to office \nde facto.  In Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973 (D.C. Cir. 1996), \nPresident Clinton removed Robert Swan from the board of the \nNational Credit Union Administration, id. at 974.  This court \nheld that it could grant Swan relief by enjoining the board and \nall  other  relevant  executive  officials  subordinate  to  the \nPresident to treat Swan as a legitimate board member.  Id. at \n980.  Similarly, in Severino v. Biden, this court concluded that \nit could issue an injunction to “reinstate a wrongly terminated \nofficial  ‘de  facto,’  even  without  a  formal  presidential \nreappointment.”  71 F.4th at 1042–1043 (quoting Swan, 100 \nF.3d at 980). \n \nAt this juncture, the government has failed to show that, \nshould  the  judgments  in  favor  of  Harris  and  Wilcox  be \nsustained on appeal, there would be an insufficient basis for the \ninjunctions that retained them in office.  Harris’s and Wilcox’s \nremovals  would  disrupt  the  routine  administration  of  the \nExecutive Branch by (1) depriving the adjudicatory bodies on \nwhich they sit of quora to function, and (2) denying the parties’ \nwhose cases Congress has channeled to the MSPB and NLRB \nthe very impartiality and expertise in decision-making that \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 103 of 114\n43 \nprotections against removal provide.  A merits panel could find \nthat to be a severe injury to the public. \n \nThe government invokes older caselaw holding that an \ninjunction  cannot  restore  someone  to  their  position  in  the \nExecutive Branch.  See Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 19–20 (citing \nIn re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888), and White v. Berry, \n171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898)).  But, as the Supreme Court itself \nhas said:  “Much water has flowed over the dam since 1898,” \nand it is now well established that “federal courts do have \nauthority to review the claim of a discharged governmental \nemployee.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 71. \n \nThe government argues that we cannot enjoin the President.  \nGov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 18.  That argument is beside the point \nbecause Harris and Wilcox never asked the district court to \nenjoin the President.  The district courts enjoined subordinate \nexecutive officers, not the President, consistent with circuit \nprecedent in Swan that binds this panel.  Harris, 2025 WL \n679303,  at  *16;  Wilcox,  2025  WL  720914  at  *16,  18.  \nInjunctions against subordinate executive officials to prevent \nillegal action by the Executive Branch are well known to the \nlaw.  See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U.S. at 584; \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 567 (2006); Swan, 100 \nF.3d at 980.  Nor do such injunctions “necessarily target[] the \nPresident[.]”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL \n559669,  at  *13  n.2  (D.C.  Cir. Feb.  15,  2025)  (Katsas,  J., \ndissenting).  The injunctions put the President under no legal \nobligation  to  recognize  Harris  and  Wilcox  as  legitimate \nofficeholders.    The  injunctions  instead  require  other \ngovernment officials to treat them as de facto office holders for \nthe rest of their terms.  \n \nThe government reads Swan and Severino as limited to \ndisputes about standing.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 20.  That \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 104 of 114\n44 \nmakes no sense.  Standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite to \nbringing suit in federal court.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998).  To establish standing, \nplaintiffs must show, among other things, that their “injury \nwould likely be redressed by judicial relief.”  TransUnion LLC \nv. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021); see Lujan v. Defenders \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 568–571 (1992); Steel Co., 523 U.S. \nat 107.  So recognizing the existence of a legal remedy is a \ncritical  precondition  to  resolving  a  lawsuit  on  the  merits.  \nBecause jurisdiction in both Swan and Severino depended on \nholding that an injunction could issue, and both cases held that \nthere was jurisdiction and went on to decide the merits, both \ncases necessarily held that an injunction could restore someone \nto office de facto.  \n \nThird, the government did not dispute in district court that \nWilcox could obtain a declaratory judgment, so it has forfeited \nany argument as to the unavailability of that form of relief in \nher case.  Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at *16.   \n \nThe government does argue that Harris is ineligible for \ndeclaratory relief.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 21.  That is \nincorrect.    Declaratory  relief  is  governed  by  “the  same \nequitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction.”  \nSamuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 73 (1971).  For the same \nreasons that injunctions could be warranted in these cases, so \ntoo could declaratory judgments.  And a declaratory judgment \nmay issue against the President.  Clinton v. City of New York, \n524 U.S. 417, 428 (1998); National Treasury Employees, 492 \nF.2d at 616.   \n \nFourth, a writ of mandamus is another available form of \nrelief  for  Harris  and  Wilcox.    A  writ  of  mandamus  is  a \ntraditional remedy at law ordering an executive official to carry \nout a mandatory and legally ministerial duty, Swan, 100 F.3d \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 105 of 114\n45 \nat 977, which includes redressing an unlawful removal from \npublic office, In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212; White, 171 U.S. at \n377.   \n \nThe use of mandamus to assert title to an office was well \nknown at the founding.  See, e.g., R. v. Blooer (1760) 97 Eng. \nRep. 697, 698 (KB) (Mansfield, C.J.) (“A mandamus to restore \nis  the  true  specific  remedy  where  a  person  is  wrongfully \ndispossessed  of  any  office  or  function[.]”);  3  WILLIAM \nBLACKSTONE,  COMMENTARIES  ON  THE  LAWS  OF  ENGLAND \n*264 (1765) (“The writ of mandamus” is “a most full and \neffectual remedy” for “wrongful removal, when a person is \nlegally possessed” of an office.); R. v. The Mayor, Aldermen, \nand Common Council, of London, (1787) 100 Eng. Rep. 96, \n97–98 (KB) (Ashhurst, J.) (agreeing with counsel’s argument \nthat “[w]henever a person is improperly suspended or removed \nfrom an office * * * the Court will grant a mandamus to restore \nhim”); R. v. The Mayor and Alderman of Doncaster (1752) 96 \nEng. Rep. 795, 795 (KB) (restoring an alderman to office with \na writ of mandamus).  Indeed, Marbury—who, like Harris and \nWilcox, was nominated by the President, and confirmed by the \nSenate, Journal of the Executive Proceedings of the Senate, \nvol.  1,  at  338,  390  (1801)—sought  mandamus  to  compel \ndelivery of his commission to serve as a justice of the peace in \nWashington D.C, see Marbury, 5 U.S. at 155.   \n \nIf no injunctive relief were available, mandamus could \nissue in these cases because the President violated a non-\ndiscretionary  statutory  duty  by  firing  Harris  and  Wilcox \nwithout  relevant  justification,  in  direct  violation  of  the \ngoverning  laws’  plain  language.    See  5  U.S.C.  § 1202(d) \n(MSPB members “may be removed by the President only for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”); 29 \nU.S.C.  § 153(a)  (The  President  can  remove  NLRB  board \nmembers only with advance notice and “for neglect of duty or \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 106 of 114\n46 \nmalfeasance  in  office”).    Although  the  President  certainly \nenjoys broad discretion when making a finding of inefficiency, \nneglect, or malfeasance, the duty to justify removal on one of \nthose grounds is non-discretionary under both statutes.   \n \nThe government argues that the President is not amenable \nto mandamus.  Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Harris 22.  While issuance \nof  mandamus  against  the  President  would  be  a  last-resort \nremedy to enforce the rule of law, binding circuit precedent \nsays that “[m]andamus is not precluded because the federal \nofficial at issue is the President of the United States.”  National \nWildlife Federation v. United States, 626 F.2d 917, 923 (D.C. \nCir. 1980); see National Treasury Employees Union v. Nixon, \n492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974).   \n \nThe government relies on Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. \n475 (1866), but that case expressly “left open” the question \nwhether mandamus can issue against the President.  Franklin \nv. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801–802 (1992); see Swan, \n100  F.3d  at  977.    That  is  because  Johnson  involved  the \nPresident’s discretionary judgment under the Reconstruction \nActs to use military force to govern the former confederate \nstates.  71 U.S. at 499.  So that decision does not speak to circuit \nprecedent  holding  that  mandamus  is  available  for  non-\ndiscretionary ministerial duties.   \n \nFor  all  those  reasons,  the  government  is  not  likely  to \nsucceed in its argument that no remedy can be given to Harris \nand Wilcox, should the decisions in their favor be sustained on \nappeal. \n \nIV \n \nThe remaining stay factors concern injury to the parties and \nthe public interest.  That balance implicates multiple competing \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 107 of 114\n47 \ninterests here because the government seeks to have provisions \nof duly enacted federal statutes declared unconstitutional and \nto prevent agencies  created and funded by Congress from \nfunctioning during (at least) the pendency of these appeals, if \nnot longer. \n \nAs the party seeking a stay, the government bears the \nburden of demonstrating that it will suffer an irreparable injury \nduring the time these cases are pending before this court.  Nken, \n556 U.S. at 433–434.  The government has disclaimed any \nargument  that  Harris  and  Wilson  are  incompetent  or \nmalfeasant.  Instead, the sole irreparable injury asserted is that \nthe President’s asserted constitutional right to terminate Harris \nand Wilcox will be infringed.  See Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Harris \n22; Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Wilcox 22.  That falls short of an \nirreparable injury for three reasons. \n \nFirst, the asserted injury to the President is entirely bound \nup  with  the  merits  of  the  government’s  constitutional \nargument.  And controlling Supreme Court precedent says \nthere is no such constitutional injury.  The Supreme Court in \nWiener said specifically that “no such power” to remove a \npredominantly  adjudicatory  board  official  “is  given  to  the \nPresident directly by the Constitution[.]”  357 U.S. at 356; see \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.  This court is in no \nposition to recognize an injury that the Supreme Court has \ntwice unanimously disclaimed.  See Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237.  \nSo the same lack of clarity that Judge Henderson’s opinion sees \nin the merits, J. Henderson Op. 1–3, means that the asserted \ninjury of not being able to remove Harris and Wilcox is equally \nuncertain to exist. \n \nSecond, the government itself has not manifested in this \nlitigation the type of imminent or daily injury now claimed by \nthe government and Judge Walker’s opinion.  Gov’t Stay Mot. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 108 of 114\n48 \nin Harris 22–23; Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 22–24; J. Walker \nOp. 43–45.  Harris’s and Wilcox’s cases have been pending for \nalmost two months.  In Harris’s case, the government agreed to \nhave the district court proceed to briefing and decision on \nsummary judgment on an expedited basis while a temporary \nrestraining order was in place.  Joint Status Report for Harris, \nECF No. 13 at 1.  In Wilcox’s case, the government proposed \nlengthening the briefing schedule, requesting that its brief be \ndue on March 10th, rather than Wilcox’s proposed February \n18th.  Joint Response Regarding Briefing Schedule for Wilcox, \nECF No. 12 at 2.  The government has not explained why it \ncould not similarly afford this court the time necessary to \ndecide a highly expedited appeal.   \n \nThird,  the  notion  that  the  presidency  is  irreparably \nweakened by not terminating Harris and Wilcox while this \nlitigation is pending ignores that eight Presidents (including \nthis  President)  have  faced  similar  constraints  in  removing \nMSPB members for decades, and fifteen Presidents could not \nremove NLRB members without cause.  Yet the government \npoints to no concrete manifestation of the harm it asserts, or \neven a public complaint from any preceding President.  Plus, if \nthe government prevails on appeal, any decisions resulting \nfrom Harris’s and Wilcox’s presence on their Boards would \nhave to be “completely undone” if a party requested it.  Collins, \n594 U.S. at 259–260.  So any harm in terms of decisions made \nis repairable. \n \nBy contrast, the entry of a stay in these cases materially \nalters the status quo in an unprecedentedly injurious manner to \nthe public as well as to Harris and Wilcox.  The point of a stay \nis to preserve the status quo pending litigation.  Nken, 556 U.S. \nat 429; Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 \nU.S. 1312, 1312 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers).  And this \ncourt’s precedent defines the relevant status quo as “the last \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 109 of 114\n49 \nuncontested status which preceded the pending controversy[,]” \nwhich is Harris and Wilcox in office.  Huisha-Huisha, 27 F.4th \nat  733  (citation  omitted).    So  does  the  Supreme  Court:  \n“Although such a stay acts to ‘ba[r] Executive Branch officials \nfrom removing [the applicant,] * * * it does so by returning to \nthe status quo—the state of affairs before the removal order \nwas entered.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 429 (citation omitted); cf. \nLackey v. Stinnie, 145 S. Ct. 659, 662 (2025) (“The purpose of \na preliminary injunction is merely to preserve  the relative \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.”). \n \nYet the stay sought by the government and entered by the \ncourt today turns the status quo for the last 46 and 89 years \nupside down.  By virtue of a preliminary and expeditiously \nconsidered  order,  this  court  has,  for  the  first  time  in  the \nNation’s history, allowed the termination of an MSPB member \nand  an  NLRB  member  in  violation  of  express  statutory \nconditions, 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) (MSPB); 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) \n(NLRB), and on-point Supreme Court and circuit precedent. \n \nIn addition, this court, without any adjudication of the \nmerits, has afforded the government relief that will disable the \nMSPB and NLRB from operating by depriving both boards of \na quorum.  5 C.F.R. § 1200.3 (MSPB); 29 U.S.C. § 153(b) \n(NLRB).  Far from “staying” anything, the court’s order acts to \nkneecap  two  federal  agencies  and  prevent  them  from \nperforming the work assigned them by federal law and funded \nby Congress.   \n \nBecause federal law expressly channels federal employee \nand labor disputes to these agencies, the stay will lead to an \nimmediate backlog of cases.  When the MSPB was deprived of \na quorum between 2017 and 2022, a backlog of 3,793 cases \nbuilt up.  MSPB, Lack of Quorum and the Inherited Inventory:  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 110 of 114\n50 \nChart of Cases Decided and Cases Pending at 2 (Feb. 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/Q58S-PLVV.   \n \nThe NLRB likewise cannot decide cases without a quorum.  \nSee 29 U.S.C. § 153(b); New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, 560 \nU.S. 674, 676 (2010).  Although the NLRB can delegate some \nof  its  responsibilities,  29  C.F.R.  §§ 102.178–182;  Order \nContingently Delegating Authority to the General Counsel, 76 \nFed.  Reg.  69,768  (Nov.  9,  2011),  it  cannot  delegate  the \nauthority  to  decide  cases.    Hundreds  of  cases  are  already \npending before the NLRB.  NLRB, Administrative Law Judge \nDecisions (Mar. 18, 2025), https://perma.cc/Z5S2-4UEP.   \n \nIf these Boards are deprived of quora, both employers and \nworkers  will  be  trapped  with  no  other  place to  take  their \ndisputes  for  resolution.    Federal  courts  cannot  hear  labor \ndisputes in the first instance because prior review by the NLRB \nis a jurisdictional prerequisite for judicial review.  29 U.S.C. \n§ 160(f); Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 476–477 \n(1964).  Nor can the parties resort to state court because the \nNational Labor Relations Act preempts state procedures.  San \nDiego Building Trades Council, Millmen’s Union, Loc. 2020 v. \nGarmon, 359 U.S. 236, 245 (1959) (“[T]he States as well as \nthe federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of \nthe National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state \ninterference with national policy is to be averted.”).  Paralyzing \nthe peaceful resolution of labor disputes threatens the vital \npublic  interests  in  avoiding  labor  strife  and  the  severe \neconomic consequences it causes.   \n \nThere is also a risk that these boards will be disabled for a \nmuch longer period of time.  Nothing obligates the President to \nappoint replacement members.  So by granting a stay, the \nmajority opinion converts the President’s removal authority \ninto the power to render inoperable, potentially for years on \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 111 of 114\n51 \nend, boards that Congress established and funded to address \ncritical national problems.  And that single-handed power to \nshutter agencies would render vital federal legislation a futility. \n \nIn  short,  whatever  the  scope  of  the  non-textual \nconstitutional removal power, it cannot license the Executive \nto destroy the ability of Congress to solve critical national \nproblems and to provide Americans with neutral and impartial \ndecision-making  processes  when  their  economic  lives, \nproperty, and wellbeing are affected.  The authority of two \nBranches is equally at stake.  That is why historical practice has \ntreated  the  statutory  adoption  of  removal  limitations  for \nmultimember boards and adjudicatory bodies as a matter for \nCongress and Presidents to work out together through the \nenactment and presentment process.   \n \nThese are just the consequences for the two agencies before \nthis court.  But given the test proposed by Judge Walker’s \nopinion foreclosing the exercise of “any” executive power or \ndeviating in any trivial manner from the 1935 FTC, this stay \ndecision admits of no cabining.  See J. Walker Op. 10 (The \nDecision of 1789 eliminated “any” Congressional control over \nremoval.), 14 (“[T]he President ha[s] inherent, inviolable, and \nunlimited  authority  to  remove  principal  officers  exercising \nsubstantial executive authority[.]”), 15 (Humphrey’s Executor \n“has few, if any, applications today.”), 20 (There can be no \nremoval protections for “any agency that wields the substantial \nexecutive power that Humphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC \nnot  to  exercise.”),  30  (Humphrey’s  Executor  cannot  be \nextended “to any new contexts[.]”), 36 (Removal protections \nare unconstitutional if the agency exercises “any” executive \npower.);  see  also  J.  Henderson  Op.  1  (questioning  “the \ncontinuing vitality of Humphrey’s”).  \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 112 of 114\n52 \nThat  would  mean  that  a  century-plus  of  politically \nindependent monetary policy is set to vanish with a pre-merits \nsnap of this court’s fingers.  A constitutional ruling that the \nPresident  has  unrestricted  removal  power  over  all \nmultimember agencies exercising any executive power directly \nthreatens  the  independence  of  numerous  multimember \nagencies,  including  the  Federal  Reserve  Board,  the  Open \nMarket Committee, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, the Chemical Safety and \nHazard  Investigation  Board,  and  the  National  Mediation \nBoard, among others. \n \nThe government insists that there is a special rule for the \nFederal Reserve Board.  Gov’t Reply Br. in Harris 8; Gov’t \nReply Br. in Wilcox 7–8.  The President does not agree.  While \nhis recent Executive Order chose to exempt “the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System” and “the Federal \nOpen Market Committee” from his “ongoing supervision and \ncontrol,” that carveout is limited only to their “conduct of \nmonetary  policy.”    Exec.  Order  No.  14,215,  Ensuring \nAccountability for All Agencies, 90 Fed. Reg. 10,447, 10,448 \n(Feb.  24,  2025).    As  to  all  other  Federal  Reserve  Board \nactivities, such as bank regulation, 12 U.S.C. § 1813(q)(3), and \nconsumer protection regulation, 15 U.S.C. § 1681m(e)(1), the \nExecutive Order claims unlimited power to remove members \nof the Federal Reserve Board for any reason or no reason at all, \n90 Fed. Reg. at 10,448.  That part-in-part-out approach allows \na President unhappy with monetary policy to fire one or all \nFederal Reserve members at will because he need not give any \nreason for a firing.  By definition, a right to remove someone \nfor no reason cannot be confined to certain reasons. \n   \nBeyond  that,  the  Executive  Order  does  not  disclaim \nauthority to remove members of the Federal Reserve or Federal \nOpen Market Committee going forward, and the government’s \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 113 of 114\n53 \nposition and Judge Walker’s opinion here admit of no such \nlimit.  Indeed, it is difficult to understand how it could, as the \ntheory that the President has illimitable removal authority is, \nby definition, a theory that there are no limits on the President’s \nauthority to remove every single executive official.7 \n \nAgencies are not the only entities at risk under the majority \nopinion’s new regime.  Given the primarily adjudicatory nature \nof the MSPB and the NLRB, it is difficult to understand how \nthe  majority  opinion’s  rule  does  not  eliminate  removal \nrestrictions on non-Article III judges, including judges of the \nCourt of Federal Claims, the Bankruptcy Courts, the Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims, and the Court of Appeals for the \nArmed Forces.  Apparently all of those adjudicators can now \nbe  fired  based  not  on  any  constitutional  decision  by  the \nSupreme Court or this court, but simply on the government’s \napplication for a stay citing nothing more than the President’s \ninability  to  fire  those  officials  as  the  requisite  irreparable \ninjury. \n \nSuch action fails to exhibit the normal “judicial humility” \nthat courts adopt at a preliminary stage when there is still \n \n7  To  the  extent  that  the  government  suggests  a  potential \nexemption for the Federal Reserve Board given its “unique historical \nbackground” and “special arrangement sanctioned by history,” see \nCFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America, \nLtd., 601 U.S. 416, 467 n.16 (2024) (Alito, J., dissenting), that \nexemption applies equally to the MSPB and NLRB, given that \nremoval restrictions on adjudicators like territorial and Claims Court \njudges and justices of the peace go back to the founding.  Since there \nis  no  basis  in  the  Constitution’s  text  or  separation-of-powers \nprinciples for minting an ad  hoc exception just for certain functions \nof one entity, the better lesson to draw from this history is that limited \nremoval restrictions for multimember and adjudicatory bodies are a \nmanifestation of the Constitution’s division of powers.     \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2108335            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 114 of 114\n54 \n“grave uncertainty” about the merits.

United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Wiener v.\nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld removal\nrestrictions for government officials on multimember adjudicatory boards.  While two\nlaws governing removal restrictions for single heads of agencies exercising executive\npolicymaking and enforcement powers have been held unconstitutional, see Seila Law\nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly stated that it was not overturning the precedent established in\nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener for multimember adjudicatory bodies.  Instead, the\nSupreme Court has, in its own words, left that precedent “in place[.]”  Seila Law, 591\nU.S. at 215 (2020); see id. at 228 (“not revisit[ing] Humphrey’s Executor”); Collins, 594\nU.S. at 250–251 (2021) (recognizing that Seila Law did “not revisit [] prior decisions”)\n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204); see also Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 687\n(1988) (in case involving restrictions on removal of an inferior officer, recognizing that\nHumphrey’s Executor remains good law); see generally Free Enter. Fund v. Public Acct.\nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (in case involving multimember board,\ndeclining to “reexamine” Humphrey’s Executor); id. at 501 (“[W]e do not * * * take issue\nwith for-cause limitations in general[.]”).\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant\nSupreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it.  If\na precedent of the Supreme Court “has direct application in a case,” lower courts\n“‘should follow the case which directly controls,’” leaving to the Supreme Court “‘the\nprerogative of overruling its own decisions.’”  Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S.\n122, 136 (2023) (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490\nU.S. 477, 484 (1989)).  That rule governs “even if the lower court thinks the precedent\nis in tension with ‘some other line of decisions.’”  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 (quoting\nRodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at 484); see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237\n(1997) (“We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, that other courts should conclude\nour more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier precedent.”).\nCircuit precedent compels the same result.  See, e.g., National Security Archive\nv. CIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“This Court is charged with following\ncase law that directly controls a particular issue[.]”); Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 54\n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237); Sierra Club v. E.P.A., 322 F.3d\n718, 725 (D.C.

The government, in fact, has acknowledged a lack of clarity\nin the law.  See Oral Arg. Tr. 24:25–25:3 (“I’m not saying that [the Supreme Court has\nbeen] clear.”); 10:24–11:5 (“[T]he Supreme Court has left the lower courts in something\nof a tough spot[.]”); 84:16–23 (There is, “at a minimum, a very substantial question” and\n“reasonable minds can differ” about the scope of Humphrey’s Executor today.);\n88:17–18 (“[T]here’s some uncertainty” in the wake of Collins.).  In addition, at both\nparties’ request, the court has set a highly expedited schedule for the merits of these\nappeals that will allow the cases to be resolved in short order.\nWe hereby vacate the March 28, 2025 order staying the district courts’ final\njudgments and permanent injunctions in these cases.  In light of the precedent in\nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener concerning multimember adjudicatory bodies, the\ngovernment’s motions for a stay pending appeal are denied.  The government has not\ndemonstrated the requisite “strong showing that [it] is likely succeed on the merits” of\nthese two appeals.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The government\nlikewise has not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that\nthere is no available remedy for Harris or Wilcox, or that allowing the district court's\ninjunctions to remain in place pending appeal is impermissible.  See Panel Order\nGranting Stay at  41-46 (Millett, J., dissenting).  Nor has it demonstrated irreparable\ninjury because the claimed intrusion on presidential power only exists if Humphrey’s\nExecutor and Wiener are overturned.  See Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356 (“[N]o such power”\nto remove a predominantly adjudicatory board official “is given to the President directly\nby the Constitution[.]”); Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.  It is\nFURTHER ORDERED that the request for a 7-day stay be denied.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk\nBY: /s/\nLaura M. Morgan\nDeputy Clerk\n* Chief Judge Srinivasan fully joins this order, but he would grant the government’s request to\nstay this order for 7 days to permit the government to seek relief from the Supreme Court.\nPage 3\n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 4 of 18\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5037 September Term, 2024\n** Circuit Judges Henderson, Katsas, Rao, and Walker dissent from this order, and they would\nalso grant the government’s request to stay this order for 7 days to permit the government to\nseek relief from the Supreme Court.

Only the Supreme Court can decide the \ndispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 6 of 18\n \nRAO, Circuit Judge, dissenting: President Donald Trump \nremoved two principal officers wielding significant executive \npower: Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board and \nGwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board. The \ndistrict court held the removals were unlawful and imposed \nunprecedented and far reaching injunctions, ordering cabinet \nsecretaries and other Executive Branch officials to treat Harris \nand Wilcox as if they were never removed. A panel of this court \nwisely stayed those orders pending appeal. A majority of the \nen banc court now vacates the panel’s order and denies the stay \npending appeal.  \nThe  government  raises  two  independent  grounds  for \ngranting a stay. The en banc majority briefly discusses the first: \nthe lawfulness of the President’s removal of these officers. In \nmy  view,  a  stay  is  warranted  on  this  ground.  But  even \naccounting for disagreement as to the continuing validity of \nHumphrey’s Executor, the district court’s remedial overreach \nindependently justifies a stay. Because the majority denies the \nstay, it should have explained why the government is not likely \nto  prevail  on  its  argument  that  the  injunctions  exceed  the \ncourt’s equitable authority. Instead, the order devotes a single \nsentence to this question, likely because these remedies have \nno historical basis and put the courts on a collision course with \nthe President over his exercise of core executive power. I \nrespectfully dissent. \n* * * \nAs to the constitutional question, the government is likely \nto  succeed  because  the  President’s  removal  of  Harris  and \nWilcox falls within his Article II authority. The Constitution \nvests all executive power in a single President. U.S. CONST. art. \nII, § 1. The President has both the power and the responsibility \nto  supervise  and  direct  Executive  Branch  officers.  Id.  § 3 \n(requiring  the  President  to  “take  Care  that  the  Laws  be \nfaithfully  executed”).  To  carry  out  this  responsibility,  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 7 of 18\n2 \nPresident must be able to remove officers at will. “Since 1789, \nthe Constitution has been understood to empower the President \nto  keep … officers  accountable—by  removing  them  from \noffice,  if  necessary.”  Free  Enter.  Fund  v.  Pub.  Co.  Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (citing Myers v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)); see also Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2191 (2020) (explaining that without \nthe  removal  power  “the  President  could  not  be  held  fully \naccountable for discharging his own responsibilities”) (cleaned \nup).  \nThe en banc majority urges that we must continue to \nfollow Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 \n(1935), and Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), \nwhich held Congress may impose limits on the President’s \nability  to  remove  officers  of  some  so-called  independent \nagencies.  Although  those  cases  have  not  been  formally \noverruled, a series of  recent Supreme Court decisions has \nsubstantially eroded them, as Judge Walker explained. See \nHarris v. Bessent, No. 25-5037, 2025 WL 980278, at *7–13 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 28, 2025) (Walker, J., concurring); see also id. \nat *21–23 (Henderson, J., concurring) (concluding “reasonable \nminds can—and often do—disagree about the ongoing vitality \nof the Humphrey’s exception”). Under Article II, “[t]he buck \nstops with the President,” and he “therefore must have some \npower of removing those for whom he cannot continue to be \nresponsible.” Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 493 (cleaned up). \nWhile statutes provide for-cause removal protections for Harris \nand  Wilcox,  these  restrictions  are  likely  unconstitutional \nbecause they interfere with the President’s authority to remove \nprincipal officers who execute the law.  \nI will not elaborate on these points in this posture, as the \ndisagreement about the scope of the President’s removal power \nwas discussed at length in the panel opinions granting the stay.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 8 of 18\n3 \n* * * \nThat brings us to the second ground for granting a stay \npending  appeal:  the  district  court’s  expansive  and \nunprecedented injunctions. Since the panel majority granted \nthe stay on constitutional grounds, it had no need to evaluate \nthe likelihood the government would succeed on its challenge \nto the injunctive remedies. See Harris, 2025 WL 980278, at *2 \nn.10 (Walker, J., concurring). The en banc majority, however, \nis denying the stay and therefore should at least have explained \nwhy the government’s challenge to the remedy fails. Even if \nthe majority is right that Harris and Wilcox were unlawfully \nremoved under current Supreme Court precedent, there is a \nwholly separate question of whether reinstatement, effectuated \nby enjoining scores of Executive Branch officials, is the proper \nremedy.  \nIn its rush to vacate the panel’s stay and get Harris and \nWilcox back to work, the en banc majority essentially ignores \nthis question and assumes Harris and Wilcox may be restored \nto their offices through a judicially imposed fiction—namely, \ninjunctions  directing  agency  officials  to  treat  Harris  and \nWilcox as though they remain in office. \nThe district court’s injunctions present difficult and novel \nquestions about the remedial authority of the Article III courts \nin the context of the President’s exercise of his Article II \npowers. See  Dellinger  v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL \n559669, at *12 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) \n(noting the “extraordinary character” of an order “direct[ing] \nthe President to recognize and work with an agency head whom \nhe has already removed”). The government is likely to succeed \non  its  remedial  challenge  because  the  injunctive  relief \nconcocted by the district court is wholly unprecedented and \ntransgresses historical limits on our equitable authority. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 9 of 18\n4 \nIt is worth recounting the broad sweep of the injunctions \nimposed here. Harris and Wilcox are no longer in office. The \ndistrict court purported to reinstate these officers by simply \ndeclaring  they  were  never  removed  in  the  first  place  and \nordering Executive Branch officials to play along. For Wilcox, \nthe district court ordered the Chairman of the NLRB “and his \nsubordinates,  agents,  and  employees”  to  refrain  “from \nremoving [Wilcox] from her office without cause or in any way \ntreating [Wilcox] as having been removed from office, from \nimpeding in any way her ability to fulfill her  duties as a \nmember of the NLRB, and from denying or obstructing her \nauthority or access to any benefits or resources of her office.” \nWilcox  v.  Trump,  No.  25-334,  2025  WL  720914,  at  *18 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025) (emphasis added). It further ordered \nthese same officials to provide Wilcox access to government \nfacilities  and  equipment  to  carry  out  her  duties.  Id.  The \ninjunction  for  Harris  is  similarly  novel,  prohibiting  the \nSecretary  of  the  Treasury  and  numerous  other  Executive \nBranch officers from “removing Harris from her office without \ncause or in any way treating her as having been removed \nwithout  cause.”  Harris  v.  Bessent,  No.  25-412,  2025  WL \n679303, at *16 (D.D.C. Mar. 4, 2025) (emphasis added). The \norder enjoins those same officials from “placing a replacement \nin Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other person \nas a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board in Harris’s \nposition.” Id. \nThese  injunctions  are  formally  directed  at  Executive \nBranch  officials,  not  the  President.  But  in  reality,  their \nprohibitions include actions only the President may take. By \nwhat remedial fiction can the district court enjoin the Chairman \nof the NLRB or the Treasury Secretary from removing officers \nthey have no power to remove? No one suggests anyone other \nthan the President has  authority to remove these principal \nofficers. By what remedial fiction can the district court enjoin \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 10 of 18\n5 \nexecutive officers from choosing a replacement for Harris? \nMembers  of  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  must  be \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.  See  5  U.S.C.  § 1201.  When  a  decision,  like \nappointment or removal, “is by Constitution or law conferred \nupon [the President], … we are precluded from saying that it \nis, in practical effect, the decision of someone else.” Franklin \nv.  Massachusetts,  505  U.S.  788,  825  (1992)  (Scalia,  J., \nconcurring  in  part  and  concurring  in  the  judgment).  The \ninjunctions  purport  to  enjoin  the  President’s  subordinates, \ndirecting them to disregard the President’s removal and to \nrefrain from taking actions within the President’s exclusive \nconstitutional  and  statutory  powers.  There  is  simply  no \nprecedent for such expansive judicial directives against officers \nof the Executive Branch wielding essential executive powers.1 \nThese orders effectively reappoint officers removed by the \nPresident and direct all other Executive Branch officials to treat \nthe  removed  officers  as  if  they  were  still  in  office.  Such \ninjunctive relief is beyond the scope of our equitable authority. \nFederal courts have authority to issue only those equitable \nremedies administered by the English Court of Chancery and \ncourts sitting in equity at the time of the Founding. See Grupo \nMexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. \n308, 318–19 (1999) (“[T]he equity jurisdiction of the federal \ncourts is the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court \n \n1  Plaintiffs  identify  only  two  district  court  decisions  enjoining \nPresidential removal decisions. See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, \n1983 WL 538, at *6 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. \nSupp. 144, 148 (D.D.C. 1993). We vacated Mackie as moot without \nreaching the merits. Mackie v. Clinton, No. 93-5001, 1993 WL \n498033, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 27, 1993). More to the point, both cases \ndirectly contradict Supreme Court precedent recognizing courts lack \nauthority to enjoin the President. See Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. \n(4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1866); Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802–03. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 11 of 18\n6 \nof Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the \nConstitution  and  the  enactment  of  the  original  Judiciary \nAct …. The  substantive  prerequisites  for  obtaining  an \nequitable remedy … depend on traditional principles of equity \njurisdiction.”) (cleaned up); Boyle v. Zacharie, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) \n648, 658 (1832) (“[T]he settled doctrine of this court is, that the \nremedies in equity are to be administered … according to the \npractice of courts of equity in [England].”).  \nNothing  in  Anglo-American  history  supports  the \ninjunctive relief granted by the district court and restored by \nthe en banc majority. Although the injunctions are nominally \ndirected at subordinate executive officials, their purpose and \neffect  are  to  restrain  the  President’s  exercise  of  his \nconstitutional appointment and removal powers. But courts \nhave never possessed authority to “enjoin the President in the \nperformance of his official duties.”2 Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 \nU.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1866); see also Franklin, 505 U.S. at \n827  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (describing  this  limitation  as \n“implicit  in  the  separation  of  powers  established  by  the \nConstitution”).  \n \n2 The Supreme Court has left open the possibility that a court may \nenjoin the President to discharge a ministerial duty, that is, one in \nwhich the President has no discretion. See Johnson, 71 U.S. at 498 \n(reserving the question of whether “the President of the United States \nmay be required, by the process of this court, to perform a purely \nministerial act under a positive law”); Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802 \n(same). The President’s exercise of his appointment and removal \nauthority can in no way be denominated as “ministerial,” however, \nas these powers are essential to his Article II power to control and \nsupervise “those who wield executive power on his behalf.” Seila \nLaw,  140  S.  Ct.  at  2191;  see  also  Johnson,  71  U.S.  at  499 \n(distinguishing  ministerial  duties  from  “purely  executive  and \npolitical” duties).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 12 of 18\n7 \nEven indulging the fiction that the injunctions are aimed \nonly at subordinate executive officials, equitable remedies of \nthis kind still find no support in our history. At the Founding, \nit appears to have been well-established that a court sitting in \nequity had “no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal \nof public officers.”3 White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) \n(quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888)); see also \nBessent v. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 517 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting). The lesson from history is clear: Federal courts \nhave no equitable authority to enjoin the removal or to mandate \nthe reinstatement of executive officers.  \nPerhaps  recognizing  these  limits  on  our  equitable \nauthority, officers challenging their removals have generally \nrefrained  from  seeking  injunctions  mandating  their \nreinstatement.  The  removed  officers  have  instead  brought \nbackpay actions for damages. See, e.g., Wiener, 357 U.S. at \n349–50; Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 618; Myers, 272 \nU.S. at 106. The en banc majority binds itself to the mast of \n \n3 Equitable remedies were unavailable because courts of law had \nexclusive jurisdiction to determine title to public office. See In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888); Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. D.C. \n310, 319–21 (1914) (collecting English and American cases granting \nmandamus to restore an unlawfully removed officer). Although the \nSupreme Court has more recently stated that courts are “not totally \nwithout authority to grant interim injunctive relief” directing the \nreinstatement of wrongfully terminated federal employees, see, e.g., \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 63 (1974), such cases do not \nnecessarily  raise  the  same  constitutional  concerns  as  judicial \nreinstatement of an officer removed by the President. Even in cases \ninvolving mere employees, the Court has warned that an injunction \nwill issue only upon a heightened showing. Id. at 83–84. Insofar as \nthese decisions go beyond the scope of equity jurisdiction at the time \nof the Founding, they conflict with the Supreme Court’s more recent \nholding in Grupo. See 527 U.S. at 318–19. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 13 of 18\n8 \nHumphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener  with  respect  to  the \nconstitutional merits but says nothing about these precedents \non the question of remedies.  \n* * * \nFinally, the district court and Judge Millett in her panel \ndissent  suggest  Harris  and  Wilcox  could  secure  a  writ  of \nmandamus  if  injunctive  relief  were  unavailable.  But  it  is \nextremely unlikely  that mandamus could issue to reinstate \nofficers removed by the President.  \nAs a threshold matter, against whom would mandamus lie? \nThese cases seem to present two options: The court could issue \nmandamus against the President to reinstate the officers, or it \ncould issue mandamus against everyone else in the Executive \nBranch to act as if the President has reinstated the officers. The \ndistrict  court  here  would  apparently  have  done  the  latter, \ndirecting various principal officers and their subordinates—but \nnot the President—to recognize that Harris and Wilcox remain \nin office.4 See Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *15; Wilcox, 2025 \nWL 720914, at *16 n.22. A writ of mandamus, however, may \nbe issued only when an official violates a “clear duty to act.” \nMuthana v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 893, 910 (D.C. Cir. 2021). No \nExecutive Branch officer or employee, not even the Treasury \n \n4 Although our decision in Swan v. Clinton contemplates that de facto \nreinstatement  via  mandamus  issued  against  Executive  Branch \nofficials  may  be  available,  that  determination  was made  in the \ncontext of finding redressability for the purposes of standing. The \ncourt  denied  relief  on  the  merits,  so  it  never  imposed  this \nextraordinary relief. See 100 F.3d 973, 976–81, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1996); \nsee also Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042–43 (D.C. Cir. 2023) \n(reaffirming Swan’s redressability analysis). Moreover, Swan says \nnothing about when it would be appropriate to impose mandamus. \nIn any event, the en banc court is not bound by Swan’s analysis. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 14 of 18\n9 \nSecretary or the Chairman of the NLRB, could have violated a \nclear duty because no officer or employee removed Harris or \nWilcox—the President did. If mandamus were to issue against \nthese officers, there would be a complete mismatch between \nthe  supposedly  unlawful  removal  and  the  officers  being \ntargeted with mandamus.  \nThat leaves the President. Judge Millett argued in dissent \nthat mandamus could issue against the President because he \n“violated a non-discretionary statutory duty by firing Harris \nand Wilcox without relevant justification.” See Harris, 2025 \nWL 980278, at *45 (Millett, J., dissenting). It is extremely \ndoubtful that mandamus could issue against the President. \nWhile this court has at times claimed authority to issue writs of \nmandamus against the President, I am aware of no case in \nwhich we have taken this extraordinary step. To the contrary, \nwe have repeatedly declined to issue the writ “in order to show \nthe  utmost  respect  to  the  office  of  the  Presidency  and  to \navoid … any clash between the judicial and executive branches \nof the Government.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 \nF.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974); see also Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n \nv. United States, 626 F.2d 917, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (declining \nto issue mandamus against the President). \nEven if mandamus could lie against the President, it is \nunlikely Harris and Wilcox could have established a “clear \nright to relief.” Muthana, 985 F.3d at 910. Given the substantial \nquestions regarding whether Humphrey’s Executor remains \ngood law, it is hard to see how the plaintiffs could have shown \ntheir removal from office “was so plainly and palpably wrong \nas [a] matter of law that the writ should issue.” United States \nex  rel.  Chicago  Great  W.  R.  Co.  v.  Interstate  Commerce \nComm’n, 294 U.S. 50, 61 (1935). Moreover, Harris and Wilcox \nhave failed to identify a single case in which mandamus has \nbeen granted when an officer contests his removal by the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 15 of 18\n10 \nPresident. At a minimum, the fact that such a remedy has never \nbeen  imposed,  much  less  against  the  President,  is  good \nevidence that Harris and Wilcox do not have a clear entitlement \nto the writ. \nFurthermore,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  mandamus  to \nreinstate  officers  removed  by  the  President  could  ever  be \nappropriate. “Although the remedy by mandamus is at law, its \nallowance is controlled by equitable principles, and it may be \nrefused for reasons comparable to those” governing a court of \nequity. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U.S. 352, \n359  (1933)  (cleaned  up).  For  this  court  to  order  the \nperformance  of  executive  acts  vested  exclusively  in  the \nPresident would “at best create[] an unseemly appearance of \nconstitutional tension and at worst risk[] a violation of the \nconstitutional separation of powers.” Swan, 100 F.3d at 978; \nsee also Johnson, 71 U.S. at 499 (rebuffing the idea of ordering \nthe President to perform executive acts as “an absurd and \nexcessive extravagance”) (cleaned up). These constitutional \nconcerns render mandamus—an extraordinary writ—wholly \ninappropriate in these removal cases. \n* * * \nThe Constitution creates three co-equal departments of \ngovernment,  each  with  an  independent  responsibility  to \ninterpret  and  uphold  the  Constitution.  While  courts  must \nfaithfully exercise their duty to say what the law is, in choosing \nremedies, courts historically have afforded every measure of \nrespect to the President. Sound judgment demands that when \ncontemplating  coercive  process  against  the  Executive,  the \ncourts take account of the “enduring consequences upon the \nbalanced power structure of our Republic.” Youngstown Sheet \n& Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 634 (1952) (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 16 of 18\n11 \nWithout considering the difficult questions regarding the \nscope of the court’s equitable or legal authority, the en banc \nmajority blesses the district court’s unprecedented injunctions \nand  purports  to  reinstate  principal  officers  ousted  by  the \nPresident. In so doing, the majority threatens to send this court \nheadlong into a clash with the Executive. I respectfully dissent. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 17 of 18\n \nWALKER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  \n \nHaving explained my views previously, I add only this: In \nPHH v. CFPB, the en banc court said that the Supreme Court \nwould need to narrow Humphrey’s Executor in order to hold \nthat  the  CFPB’s  removal  restrictions  are  unconstitutional.1  \nThen, in Seila Law, the Supreme Court held those restrictions \nunconstitutional.2  So by the PHH majority’s own reasoning, \nthe outcome in Seila Law depended on the Supreme Court \nnarrowing Humphrey’s Executor.   \n \nPerhaps  the  members  of  today’s  en  banc  majority \nrecognize that Humphrey’s Executor cannot be read as broadly \nas it once could but disagree with the panel in this case about \nhow  much  it  has  been  narrowed.    If  so,  it  is  hollow  and \nhyperbolic for today’s majority to proclaim, “The Supreme \n \n1  See  881  F.3d  75,  93  (D.C.  Cir.  2018)  (“There  is  nothing \nconstitutionally  suspect  about  the  CFPB’s  leadership  structure. \nMorrison and Humphrey’s Executor stand in the way of any holding \nto the contrary.”); id. at 113 (Tatel, J., concurring, joined by Millett, \nJ., and Pillard, J.) (“PHH is free to ask the Supreme Court to revisit \nHumphrey’s Executor and Morrison, but that argument has no truck \nin a circuit court of appeals.”); id. at 118 (Wilkins, J., concurring, \njoined by Rogers, J.) (“the dissenters seek to overcome the precedent \nupholding  tenure  protection  for  officers  with  significant  quasi-\njudicial and quasi-legislative responsibilities”). \nSimilarly, in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, the majority said \nthe “bulk of the Fund’s challenge to the Act was fought — and \nlost — over seventy years ago when the Supreme Court decided \nHumphrey’s Executor.”  537 F.3d 667, 685 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The \nSupreme Court disagreed.  Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 \nU.S. 477, 514 (2010) (“While we have sustained in certain cases \nlimits on the President’s removal power, the Act before us imposes \na new type of restriction — two levels of protection from removal \nfor those who nonetheless exercise significant executive power. \nCongress cannot limit the President’s authority in this way.”). \n2 Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2197 (2020). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5055      Document #2109524            Filed: 04/07/2025      Page 18 of 18\n2 \nCourt has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant \nSupreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself \nchanges it or overturns it.”  Each of us recognizes that a lower \ncourt  cannot  overrule  Humphrey’s  Executor.    We  simply \ndisagree about how broadly to read it. \n \n  \n ",

ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES AND \nCIRCUIT JUSTICE FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT: \nThe  government  asks  this  Court  to  overturn  a  century  of  practice  and \nprecedent—and invalidate the structure of numerous agencies—“on a short fuse \nwithout benefit of full briefing and oral argument.”  Does v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17, 18 \n(2021) (Barrett, J., concurring).  Doing so would have immediate consequences for \nfoundational institutions—from the Federal Reserve to the National Transportation \nSafety Board.  Even if this Court wishes to revisit settled precedent, a blitzkrieg-to-\njudgment is not the way to go about it.  The Court should deny the application; \npreserve the status quo that has existed for a century; allow the D.C. Circuit to hold \nexpedited oral argument on May 16; and consider the case in due course.   \nThe  time  courts  have  had  to  consider  the  new  Administration’s  major \nstructural constitutional challenge is inversely proportional to how long this Court’s \nprecedents have decided it. It was just two months ago, on February 10, that the \nPresident—without even trying to show cause—purported to remove Cathy Harris \nfrom  her  position  as  a  member  of  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board,  an \n“adjudicatory body” that hears employment appeals regarding civil servants.  Wiener \nv. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958).  Under a law that has existed for half-\ncentury without challenge from chief executives such as Reagan and Bush, the \nPresident may terminate members of the Board “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, \nor malfeasance in office.”  5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).   \nThe  government  insists  that  Article  II  of  the  Constitution  provides  the \nPresident unchecked authority to remove Board members at will.  That is not the law.  \n  1 \n\nUnder Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), Congress may \nenact standards of removal for “multimember board[s],” Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 \nU.S.  197,  207  (2020),  particularly  “predominantly  quasi  judicial,”  Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 624, “adjudicatory bod[ies],” Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.   \nHumphrey’s Executor reflects “deeply rooted historical practice” on which the \npolitical branches have long relied.  PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 174 (D.C. Cir. \n2018) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  In Seila Law and Collins, this Court recently \ninvalidated removal protections for novel agencies led “by a single individual” that \nlacked a foothold in history.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213; see Collins v. Yellen, 594 \nU.S. 220, 251 (2021).  This Court did not “revisit Humphrey’s Executor or any other \nprecedent,” and the Chief Justice’s decision repeatedly contrasted single-director-led \nagencies with traditional multimember boards or commissions.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 228.  Since then, at the United States’s urging, this Court has denied requests to \noverturn Humphrey’s Executor,1 and the Courts of Appeals have uniformly rejected \nthe strained reading of Seila Law and Collins the Solicitor General now embraces.2   \nThe government now asks this Court to rush to junk that settled precedent in \nthe guise of a stay pending appeal.  As even the government acknowledges (at 14), it \nmust show a “likelihood of success” “under existing law” to receive a stay.  NetChoice, \n \n1 See Leachco, Inc. v. CPSC, No. 24-156 (cert denied Jan. 13, 2025); Consumers’ Rsch. \nv. CPSC, No. 23-1323 (cert denied Oct. 21, 2024).   \n2 See Magnetsafety.org v. CPSC, 129 F.4th 1253, 1266 (10th Cir. 2025); Leachco, Inc. \nv. CPSC, 103 F.4th 748, 763 (10th Cir. 2024); Consumers’ Rsch. v. CPSC, 91 F.4th \n342, 351-352 (5th Cir. 2024) (Willett, J.); Illumina, Inc. v. FTC, 88 F.4th 1036, 1047 \n(5th Cir. 2023); Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC, No. 24-5054, 2024 WL 1549732, at *2 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 29, 2024) (per curiam).   \n  2 \n\nLLC v. Paxton, 142 S. Ct. 1715, 1716 (2022) (Alito, J., dissenting) (quotation marks \nomitted) (emphasis added).  But the best the government could say in the D.C. Circuit \nwas that there was “a lack of clarity in the law”—well short of the demanding \nstandard needed to receive a stay pending appeal.  App.3a.   \nTo be clear:  There is no “lack of clarity.”  Humphrey’s Executor has not been \nnarrowed into nonexistence, such that it applies only “if the agency in question is the \nidentical twin of the 1935” Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  App.54a (Walker, J., \nconcurring).  Quite the opposite.  This Court took pains not to disturb the Humphrey’s \nExecutor framework for traditional multimember boards and commissions.  The \nMerit Systems Protection Board exercises far less significant authority than the FTC, \nand falls within the heartland of this Court’s precedent.  As the government agreed, \nthe Board is “predominantly an adjudicatory body.”  App.94a (Millett, J., dissenting) \n(quoting oral argument).  It does not launch investigations, set policy, fill up vague \nstatutes, or regulate “the economy at large.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 253.  The Board \nmerely hears discrete cases regarding civil servants, and neutrally applies laws \nCongress passed prohibiting arbitrary dismissal, discrimination, and retaliation.   \nThe Board is the easy case.  If the Board’s structure is not constitutional under \nHumphrey’s Executor, nothing is.  Not the Federal Reserve, which sets monetary \npolicy and regulates banks.  Not the National Transportation Safety Board, which \ndetermines  the  causes  of  air  accidents.    The  list  goes  on.    Granting  the  stay \napplication in this case would invalidate agencies in every case.3  \n \n3 The D.C. Circuit should be permitted to decide both Wilcox v. Trump, 25-5057 (D.C. \n  3 \n\nThe government separately argues that Article III courts are powerless to issue \na meaningful remedy when the President violates a for-cause removal statute.  The \nCourt should reject the suggestion that one-weird-trick allows the government to \nsidestep Humphrey’s Executor.  Courts may issue equitable relief.  See Sampson v. \nMurray, 415 U.S. 61, 71 (1974); Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 370, 389 (1957); \nVitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 537, 546 (1959); Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, \n1042-1043 (D.C. Cir. 2023); Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \nThere is an extremely long Anglo-American history and tradition of courts issuing \nthe same relief in the form of mandamus to provide “full and effectual remedy” “for \nwrongful  removal.”  3  William  Blackstone,  Commentaries  *264; see Marbury  v. \nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 173 (1803) (wrongful divestment of Senate-confirmed \nposition presented “a plain case for a mandamus”).  And the government agreed below \nthat the District Court could declare “that the removal was unlawful,” and it is bound \nby that concession before this Court.  See Gov. D.C. Cir. Br. at 40 n.7.   \nAt minimum, the government cannot make the necessary “strong showing” of \nsuccess on the merits, Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009) (quotation marks \nomitted), under “existing precedent.”  NetChoice, LLC, 142 S. Ct. at 1716 (Alito, J., \ndissenting)  (quotation  marks  omitted).    But  the  point  is  more  basic:    In  our \nconstitutional system, courts “say what the law is,” and the executive branch complies \nwith the judiciary’s judgments.  Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177.  To hold that the judiciary \n \nCir.), and this case, and examine the different issues each Board presents.  But if this \nCourt were to grant review in Wilcox, it should grant this case as well, so the \ndifferences in each Board can be ventilated and provide guidance to the lower courts. \n  4 \n\ncannot provide meaningful relief in this case would overturn Humphrey’s Executor \nby  creating  a  remedial  blackhole  in  which  lawful  statutes  Congress  passed  are \ncompletely unenforceable.  The Court should be particularly careful of going down \nthis path, because it would prevent the Court from ever preserving any subset of \nremoval statutes, and risks undermining the foundations of judicial review in cases \ninvolving the executive. \nThe government’s application flunks the remaining stay factors.  History \ndisproves the government’s assertion that the President will be irreparably harmed \nif he cannot remove Harris.  No other President in our lifetimes has ever attempted \nto violate for-cause removal statutes in this manner.  The current chief executive is \nnot being held to a different standard.  He is being asked to follow binding precedent \nunless and until the Court overturns it, just like his predecessors for nearly a \ncentury.  If that is an incursion on executive power, it is only one due to his \nidiosyncratic view of what that power is—one that rejects Congress’ and this Court’s \nlongstanding view of the issue, as well as the practice of every past President.  See \nNLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 525 (2014). \nOn the other side of the ledger, there are high costs to granting a stay.  A stay \nwill subject Harris to arbitrary removal, the very thing that Congress did not want.  \nAs a result of the Court’s administrative stay, the Merit Systems Protection Board \nimmediately lost a quorum, and the Board will be divested of a quorum until the end \nof the case should the Court issue a stay.  Meanwhile, the Court’s decision would send \na  clear  signal  that  the  President  can  arbitrarily  remove  members  of  every \n  5 \n\nindependent agency, from the Federal Reserve Board on down.  That way lies chaos. \nFinally, the Court should reject the government’s request to take the extremely \nunusual step of granting certiorari before judgment.  The Courts of Appeal are in \nagreement, and the Court previously denied review in cases asking it to overturn \nHumphrey’s Executor.  At this unique juncture, a rush-to-judgment that would call \ninto question the longstanding balance-of-power could be particularly destabilizing. \nAnd there is no need to do so.  The D.C. Circuit has already set an expedited briefing \nschedule and will hear oral argument on May 16, 2025.  There are important issues \nthat the lower court should consider, such as: the precise functions of the Board; its \nunique history; and the effect of a decision invalidating the Board on other critical \nindependent adjudicators who sit within the executive branch. \nOne example demonstrates the last point.  It is telling that nowhere in its 39-\npage  application  did  the  Solicitor  General  say  a  word  about  what  overturning \nHumphrey’s Executor—or narrowing it into oblivion—would mean for the Federal \nReserve Board, despite this moment of considerable economic turmoil.  Not one.  If \nthe Court is to consider overturning landmark precedent, it should at least do so with \nthe benefit of the Court of Appeals’ reasoned analysis on that and other important \nissues.  The Court should deny the application. \nBACKGROUND \nA. The Merit Systems Protection Board \nThis case involves a quintessential adjudicatory body—the Merit Systems \nProtection Board—that reflects a centuries-long effort to combat patronage in federal \n  6 \n\nemployment.  See infra pp. 18-19.  At the President’s urging, Congress provided that \nthe Board’s members “may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.”  5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).  The Board’s three members \nserve staggered seven-year terms, and no more than two are of the same political \nparty.  Id. §§ 1201, 1202(a)-(c). \nThe Board adjudicates federal employee appeals, including claims of political \ndiscrimination and whistleblower retaliation.  Id. §§ 2302(b)(1), (b)(8).  Its jurisdiction \nis circumscribed to avoid encroaching on core Presidential prerogatives.  It may not \nhear appeals by political appointees, id. § 7511, has limited authority as to senior \nexecutive managers, id. § 3592(a), and cannot wade into national security issues, \nKaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (en banc). \nB. Procedural History \n1.  Cathy Harris was nominated and confirmed as a member in 2022.  Her term \nexpires March 1, 2028.  On February 10, 2025, Harris received an email claiming the \nPresident terminated her, without any reason.  She filed this action the next day.   \nIn the proceedings below, the government did not contest: (i) that the Board \ndoes not “dictate or enforce policies regarding the federal workforce”; (ii) that the \n“Board does not initiate disciplinary actions”; and (iii) that “over 95% of the decisions” \nof the Board are “unanimous.”  D. Ct. Dkt. 22-2 at 7-9. \n2.  The District Court concluded that Board members’ “removal protections are \nconstitutional  under Humphrey’s Executor.”    App.186a.    As  the  District  Court \nexplained, Seila Law and Collins took pains to preserve “the constitutionality of for-\n  7 \n\ncause removal provisions for multimember bodies of experts heading an independent \nagency.”  App.189a-190a.  In Seila Law, this “Court even opined that Congress could \nfix” the agency in question by “ ‘converting’ ” the agency “ ‘into a multimember’ ” body.  \nApp.191a (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 237).  The court found the Board to be a \nquintessential multimember body with “ ‘quasi judicial’ ” “duties” that “conducts \npreliminary adjudications of federal employees’ claims.”  App.192a.   \nThe District Court granted injunctive and declaratory relief for Harris.  But \nthe court also made clear that, were “equitable injunctive relief unavailable,” it would \nissue “a writ of mandamus as an alternative remedy.”  App.214a.   \n3.  The government appealed and sought a stay pending appeal.  At oral \nargument on the stay, the government characterized the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard as “predominantly an adjudicatory body.”  Supp.App.5a.  \nThe panel granted the stay pending appeal.  There was no majority opinion.  \nIn a concurrence, Judge Walker narrowed Humphrey’s Executor into non-existence, \ncalling it a “benched quarterback” that applies only “if the agency in question is the \nidentical twin of the 1935 FTC.”  App.53a-54a (Walker, J., concurring).  Under his \nview of Seila Law and Collins, nothing is left of Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener, \nand no independent agency is constitutional, including the Federal Reserve. \nJudge Henderson voted to grant the stay.  But she acknowledged that the \nBoard’s “powers are relatively more circumscribed” than other agencies, and deemed \n“the merits as a slightly closer call.”  App.73a, 76a (Henderson, J., concurring).   \nJudge Millett dissented, emphasizing that the panel’s decision conflicted with \n  8 \n\n“controlling Supreme Court precedent” and conflicted with every Court of Appeals to \nhave considered the question.  App.83a (Millett, J., dissenting).  The panel’s order, \nshe explained, called “into question the constitutionality of dozens” of agencies “from \nthe Federal Reserve Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the National \nTransportation Safety Board and the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.”  Id. \n4.  The en banc Court vacated the stay in a 7-4 vote.  The D.C. Circuit explained \nthat this Court “has repeatedly stated that it was not overturning the precedent \nestablished  in Humphrey’s Executor  and Wiener  for  multimember  adjudicatory \nbodies.”  App.2a.  The appeal is proceeding on a “highly expedited schedule.”  App.3a.  \nThe merits have been fully briefed and oral argument is scheduled on May 16, 2025. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Government Cannot Show A Likelihood Of Success Under Existing Law.  \nA stay pending appeal is an “extraordinary” remedy.  Williams v. Zbaraz, 442 \nU.S. 1309, 1311 (1979) (Stevens, J., in chambers).  To prevail, the government must \nprove a “substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Alabama Ass’n. of Realtors \nv. Dep’t of Health and Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 761 (2021) (per curiam), “under \n‘existing law.’  ”  NetChoice, 142 S. Ct. at 1716 (Alito, J., dissenting) (emphasis added) \n(quoting Merrill v. Milligan, 142 S. Ct. 879 (2022) (Roberts, C .J., dissenting)).  The \ngovernment does not come close.  Seila Law and Collins did not invalidate the rule \nfor  traditional  multimember  bodies,  and  the  Board  falls  squarely  within  the \nheartland of Humphrey’s Executor.  Even the government agreed below that it is \n“predominantly an adjudicatory body.”  Supp.App.12.  Finally, the District Court’s \n  9 \n\norder rests on centuries of Anglo-American remedies precedent.   \nA.  Ruling For The Government Requires Overturning The Humphrey’s \nExecutor Framework. \n1.  The Board Falls Within The Heartland Of Humphrey’s Executor. \na.  Under Humphrey’s Executor, Congress may afford a measure of removal \nprotection to “multimember board[s] or commission[s],” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207, \nwhich exercise “predominantly quasi judicial” functions, Humphrey’s Executor, 295 \nU.S. at 624, and serve as “adjudicatory bod[ies],” Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.   \nThe quintessential example is the War Claims Commission, a three-member \ngroup of experts housed within the executive branch that “ ‘adjudicate[d]’ ” claims \n“ ‘according to law’ ” and issued final decisions unreviewable “by any other official of \nthe United States or by any court.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 355.  Wiener rejected the \n“naked[]” “claim that the President could remove a member of an adjudicatory body \nlike the War Claims Commission merely because he wanted his own appointees.”  Id. \nat 356.  “[N]o such power is given to the President directly by the Constitution.”  Id.  \nThe Court explained that modest removal protections further critical due process \nvalues by ensuring the “attitude of independence” needed to decide cases without fear \nor  favor.    Id.  at  353  (quoting  Humphrey’s Executor,  295  U.S.  at  629).    The \nadjudicatory powers in Wiener far eclipsed those of the Board here—from the subject \nmatter (payment of claims) to how decisions were reviewed (zero review in Wiener). \nIn the years since Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener, this Court has not once \ninvalidated a “traditional independent agency headed by a multimember board or \ncommission.”    Seila Law,  591  U.S.  at  207.    Quite  the  opposite.    “[R]emoval \n  10 \n\nrestrictions” “have been generally regarded as lawful” for entities ranging from the \n“Consumer Product Safety Commission” to “Article I courts.”  Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 724-725 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see Mistretta v. United States, 488 \nU.S. 361, 411 (1989).  The Court has squarely rejected the argument, which the \ngovernment  now  embraces  (at  12),  that  “the  language  of  Article  II  vesting  the \nexecutive power of the United States in the President requires that every officer of \nthe United States exercising any part of that power must serve at the pleasure of the \nPresident.”  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690 n.29. \nb.  In Selia Law and Collins, this Court held that Humphrey’s Executor does \nnot extend to “novel” agencies headed by a single director that wield considerable \n“rulemaking  and  enforcement  powers”  and  are  exempt  from  the  traditional \nappropriations process.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 251; Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; see Free \nEnter. Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 496 (2010).  But in Seila Law, the Court went \nout of its way not to disturb “Humphrey’s Executor or any other precedent,” Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 228, and repeatedly contrasted the novel agencies at issue in those \ncases with permissible multimember boards, see id. at 207, 216, 218, 237.  Meanwhile, \nCollins represented a “straightforward application of” Seila Law to another “agency \nled by a single Director.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 251. \nFinally,  if  there  were  any  question  about  the  validity  of  traditional \nmultimember  bodies  after Seila Law  and Collins,  seven  Justices  in Seila Law \ndispelled that doubt when they invited Congress to repair the constitutional flaw by \nreconstituting the agency as a multimember body.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 237 \n  11 \n\n(Roberts, C.J., joined by Alito and Kavanaugh, JJ.); id. at 298 (Kagan, J., joined by \nGinsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ.).  As the government argued to this Court just \na few short months ago, litigants “cannot plausibly maintain that” this Court “invited \nCongress to adopt a structure that the preceding pages of the same opinion had just \ndeclared unconstitutional.”  U.S. Brief in Opp., Leachco, Inc. v. CPSC at 15, No. 24-\n156 (U.S. Nov. 14, 2024).  In short, Seila Law and Collins mean what they said, and \nHumphrey’s Executor dictates the rule for traditional multimember bodies. \nc.  The Merit Systems Protection Board falls squarely within the heartland of \nthe Humphrey’s Executor framework in both form and function, and the government \ncannot make the strong showing of success under existing law needed to receive a \nstay.  By contrast, if this Board is not constitutional, nothing is left of Humphrey’s \nExecutor, and Seila Law’s repeated admonitions that it did not disturb precedent \nwould have been “a disingenuous bait-and-switch.”  App.105a (Millett, J., dissenting). \nStart with function.  Even the government agrees the Board is “predominantly \nan adjudicatory body.”  App.94a (Millett, J., dissenting) (quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Board does not fill up vague statutes, establish policy, or “regulate the conduct \nof private parties.”  App. 192a.  It hears a narrow range of appeals regarding civil \nservants—including claims of “discrimination, loyalty oaths, coercion to engage in \npolitical  activity,  and  retaliation  against  whistleblowers”—applying  the  laws \nCongress passed to the facts of each discrete case.  App.193a.  Just like an Article III \ncourt, the Board “cannot initiate its own personnel cases, but must instead passively \nwait for them to be brought.”  App.192a-193a (quotation marks omitted).  \n  12 \n\nThere is no way to rule for the government without overturning Wiener.  Just \nas with the War Claims Commission, Congress could have “given jurisdiction over” \ncivil service disputes “to the District Courts or to the Court of Claims.”  Weiner, 357 \nU.S. at 355.  That fact only underscores the “intrinsic judicial character of the task \nwith which the” Board is “charged.”  Id.  If anything, the Board exercises less power \nthan the Commission in Wiener, whose decisions were completely unreviewable “by \nany other official of the United States or by any court.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  \nBy contrast, the Board’s decisions are reviewable in Article III courts.   \nThe  Board’s  history  confirms  its  adjudicatory  nature.    In  1883,  Congress \nestablished  the  Civil  Service  Commission,  which  handled  both  personnel \nmanagement  and  adjudications.    In  1978,  Congress  split  the  Commission  into \nmultiple entities, including: (1) the Office of Personnel Management, to manage the \nfederal workforce; and (2) the Board, as an adjudicatory authority.  Pub. L. No. 95-\n545, 92 Stat. 1111, 1122 (1978).  In 1989, Congress cleaved off the Office of Special \nCounsel—a single-director led entity that investigates and prosecutes violations of \ncivil service rules—into a separate executive branch agency.  Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 \nStat. 16 (1989).  The result is a fully “adjudicatory” Board.  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.   \nThe  Board’s  multimember  structure  is  also  straight  out  of  Humphrey’s \nExecutor.  The Board’s three members must be “drawn from both sides of the aisle,” \nand serve “staggered terms,” ensuring the accrual of “significant expertise.”  Seila \nLaw,  591  U.S.  at  218; accord Humphrey’s Executor,  295  U.S.  at  624.    By  law, \nmembers must be experts whose “ability, background, training, or experience” make \n  13 \n\nthem “especially qualified” to serve on the Board.  5 U.S.C. § 1201.  Meanwhile, the \nPresident may designate the Board’s chairman, affording him a measure of control \nover the Board.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225; PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 189 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  And the Board lacks the unique permanent funding \nfeatures that insulated agencies in Seila Law and Collins from the constitutional \n“appropriations process,” and further “aggravate[d] the * * * threat to Presidential \ncontrol.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 226. \nd.  Any one of Humphrey’s Executor, Wiener, Seila Law and Collins would be \nenough to deny a stay.  But it bears emphasis:  The Board reflects “deeply rooted \nhistorical practice,” which carries great weight in the “separation of powers analysis.”  \nPHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 174, 179 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 222; Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 505.  This history underscores why the Court \nshould deny the application and leave the existing legal framework in place. \nAs Humphrey’s Executor recognized, Congress has long enacted measures to \nprotect the “independence” of adjudicators who sit within the executive branch.  295 \nU.S. at 630.  In the first years of the new nation, Congress allowed territorial judges \nto hold their commissions “during good behavior.”4  Shortly before the Civil War, \nCongress created the Court of Claims, a “legislative [c]ourt” whose judges were \nprotected from arbitrary removal.  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.5  In 1890, \n \n4 See, e.g., An Act to Provide for the Government of the Territory North-West of the \nRiver Ohio, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50, 51 (1789); Act of Apr. 7, 1798, ch. 28, § 3, 1 Stat. 549, \n550 (1798).  Territorial courts were not Article III courts.  McAllister v. United States, \n141 U.S. 174, 184, 187 (1891).   \n5 See Act of Feb. 24, 1855, ch. 122, § 1-1, 33 Stat. 612 (1855).  The Court of Claims \n  14 \n\nCongress afforded removal protection to the Board of General Appraisers;6 in 1924, \nto the members of the Board of Tax Appeals; and in 1946, to administrative law \njudges.7  Today, judges on the Tax Court, 26 U.S.C. § 7443(f), the Court of Appeal for \nVeterans Claims, 38 U.S.C. § 7253(f), and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, \n10 U.S.C. § 942(c), are all adjudicators who sit within the executive branch and are \nprotected from arbitrary dismissal through for-cause removal provisions.   \nThere is an equally established tradition of multimember bodies with removal \nprotection.  Congress created the multimember Sinking Fund Commission in 1790; \nthe First Bank of the United States a year later; and the Second Bank in 1816.  \nApp.109a-110a (Millett, J., dissenting).  To pick a few more, Congress established the \nInterstate Commerce Commission in 1887; the Federal Reserve Board in 1913; the \nFederal Trade Commission in 1914; the National Mediation Board in 1934; the \nNational Labor Relations Board in 1935; the Atomic Energy Commission in 1946; the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1977; and the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard  in  1978.8    And  there  are  many  other  agencies,  such  as  the  National \n \nwas a “legislative court.”  Williams v. United States, 289 U.S. 553, 571, 581 (1933); \naccord Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629. \n6 Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, § 12, 51 Stat. 136-138 (1890).   \n7 Revenue Act of 1924, ch. 243, 43 Stat. 253, 337 (1924); Administrative Procedure \nAct, ch. 324, § 11, 237, 244 (1946).   \n8 See Interstate Commerce Act, Pub. L. No. 49-104, 24 Stat. 379, 383 (1887); Federal \nReserve Act, Pub. L. No. 63-48, 38 Stat. 251, 260 (1913); Federal Trade Commission \nAct, Pub. L. No. 63-203, 38 Stat. 717, 718 (1914); An Act to Amend the Railway Labor \nAct, Pub. L. No. 442, 48 Stat. 1185, 1193 (1934); National Labor Relations Act, Pub. \nL.

No. 95-\n91, 91 Stat. 565, 582 (1977). \n  15 \n\nTransportation Safety Board.  The Solicitor General’s Vesting Clause and Take Care \nClause arguments would imperil all of them, on a highly expedited timeline.  \nIn contrast to the government’s current position, the executive branch has long \naccepted this deeply rooted tradition.  Neither the Office of Legal Counsel “nor any \nPresident in a signing statement has called into doubt Humphrey’s Executor or \nWiener.”  App.117a n.6 (Millett, J., dissenting).  The opposite.  When Congress \ncreated the Board, the Department of Justice agreed it is “a quasi-judicial body whose \nofficials may be legitimately exempted from removal at the pleasure of the President.”  \n2 O.L.C. 120, 121 (1978) (emphasis added); see 3 O.L.C. 357, 358-359 (1979) (similar).  \nThe Humphrey’s Executor framework is at the constitutional apogee—representing \nthe legal consensus of all three branches:  For nearly a century, Congress and the \nPresident have created independent agencies in reliance on this Court’s precedent. \nThis long history highlights the extraordinary stare decisis values at stake, \nwhich stand to be upended should the Court grant a stay.  If the design of the Merit \nSystems Protection Board is not constitutional, nothing is.  Not the Federal Reserve \nBoard,  which  sets  monetary  policy  and  regulates  banks.    Not  the  National \nTransportation Safety Board, which investigates air accidents.  Not any legislative \ncourt.  This Court should not usher in such upheaval on its emergency docket.  \ne.  In attempt to assuage concerns about eliminating the independence of the \nFederal Reserve, the government below has suggested, in wishy-washy language, \nthat the Federal Reserve’s “ ‘unique historical background’ ” “may illuminate the \nconstitutional analysis,” pointing to “the First and Second Banks of the United \n  16 \n\nStates.”  Gov. D.C. Cir. Merits Reply Br. 14 (quoting CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n \nof Am., Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 467 n.16 (2024) (Alito, J., dissenting)). \nThat does not hold up.  There is no coherent way to create a special “Federal \nReserve exception” that cabins the destructive effects of the government’s theory.  For \none thing, the Federal Reserve exercises far more executive power than the Merit \nSystems Protection Board.  It sets money policy and regulates banks.  It is incoherent \nto  argue  that  the  Constitution  provides  the  President  unfettered  authority  to \nterminate everyone who exercises the smallest amount of executive power—but then \nblow a massive hole in that constitutional theory for the Federal Reserve.  No matter \nhow the Court couches a stay order, granting a stay in this case will empower the \nPresident to undermine the Federal Reserve tomorrow—which is precisely why the \nCourt should deny the application.  For another, the fact that directors of the First \nand Second Banks were not removable by the President does not mean there should \nbe a special historical exception for the Federal Reserve.  See App.110a (Millett, J., \ndissenting).  It shows that the government’s theory of executive power is wrong.  The \nFramers did not think every member of a multimember board needed to be removable \nby the President at will.9 \n \n9 Notably, the Solicitor General’s brief before this Court says not one word about the \nFederal Reserve.  But his claim that all executive power is vested in the President \nwould obviously undo the Federal Reserve.  And the historical exception argument \nthe government floated below (but not in this Court) would not prevent the President \nfrom firing the Reserve’s members without cause anyway.  The President could point \nto the language “may,” and then insist, as he does in this Court, that the federal \ncourts are powerless to provide relief.  Under the Solicitor General’s remarkable view, \ntherefore, all that stands between the firing of Jerome Powell and the Constitution is \na cashier’s check that would have to be cut for his backpay.  That can hardly be the \n  17 \n\nRegardless, even under this half-baked historical exception test, the Merit \nSystems Protection Board has a “unique historical background.”  Cmty. Fin. Servs., \n601 U.S. at 467 n.16 (Alito, J., dissenting).  Consider the highlights.  Since the \nFounding, there has been a tug-of-war between merit-based service and patronage.  \nPatricia Wallace Ingraham, The Foundation of Merit: Public Service in American \nDemocracy 17-18 (1995).  By the Civil War, the partisan spoils system had taken hold.  \nThe effects were “tragic,” undermining “the effectiveness of the Union army and” \n“federal government.”  Id. at 22.  Only after President Garfield was assassinated by \nan office-seeker did Congress pass the Pendleton Act in 1883, which established a \nCivil Service Commission, with three members removable by the President at will.  \nId. at 27.  But even then, patronage persisted.  The “Commission itself” emerged as \n“a problem” because it served inherently conflicting roles, “protect[ing] the merit \nsystem” while “assist[ing] the president in patronage matters.”  Id. \nAbuses  in  the  Watergate  Era  brought  matters  to  a  head.    Investigations \nrevealed that “top Commission officials,” “including Commissioners,” succumbed to \n“high-level pressures” to engage in patronage and “failed to respond effectively” to \n“political interference in the operation of the Federal merit system.”  U.S. Civ. Serv. \nComm., A Self-Inquiry into Merit Staffing 39, 46, 65 (1976).  President Jimmy Carter \ncampaigned  on  and  spearheaded  the  passage  of  the  Civil  Service  Reform  Act.  \nIngraham, supra,  at  75-77.    That  legislation  split  the  Commission’s  personnel \nmanagement and adjudicatory functions, see supra p.13, and created a “strong and \n \nmeaning of our constitutional structure.   \n  18 \n\nindependent” Board free of the defects that had plagued the old Commission.  S. Rep. \nNo.  95-969,  at  7  (1978).    The  Board’s  unique  history—and  untouched  for-cause \nremoval  provisions  for  a  half  century—strongly  counsel  against  upsetting  the \ncenturies-long, bipartisan effort to ensure a professional, merit-based civil service. \nf.  Finally, the government’s own admissions before the D.C. Circuit confirm it \ncannot make a strong showing of success based on existing precedent.  Before that \ncourt, the government said there is “a lack of clarity in the law.”  App.3a.  We disagree, \nas does every Court of Appeals to have considered the question, see supra p.2 n.2.  \nBut those admissions doom a stay here.  If the law is unclear, the government does \nnot deserve extraordinary relief based on existing precedent.   \n2.  The Government’s Contrary Arguments Are Wrong. \na.  In this Court, the government argues (at 13-15) that Seila Law and Collins \nnarrowed the Humphrey’s Executor framework into oblivion, rendering it applicable \nonly to “the identical twin of the 1935 FTC” “as Humphrey’s understood the 1935 \nFTC.”  App.54a (Walker, J., concurring).  That is not the best, let alone a fair, reading \nof this Court’s decisions.  This Court did not effectively overturn the Humphrey’s \nExecutor framework while disclaiming that very result. \nThe blast radius of the government’s theory reaches far and wide.  If everyone \nwho sits within Article II must be removable at will under the Vesting and Take Care \nClauses,  see  Application  at  13,  then  every  independent  agency  and  neutral \nadjudicator lives underneath “the Damocles’ sword of removal,” Wiener, 357 U.S. at \n356.  According to the government, the President could fire the members of the \n  19 \n\nNational Transportation Security Board if they refuse to cover up the cause of an \naccident.  The President could remove Tax Court judges who decline to give tax \nbreaks to political allies.  And so on.  The threat of removal will undermine both \nactual impartiality and the appearance of it that are critical for the public to have \nfaith in these foundational institutions.  There is a reason no President has attempted \nto exert this kind of naked authority:  The corrosive effects are vast and disturbing. \nThe  government’s  theory  would  mean  that  “a  century-plus  of  politically \nindependent  monetary  policy”  is  no  more.    App.134a  (Millett,  J.,  dissenting).  \nMeanwhile, the merit based civil service is on the chopping block.  The government \npays lip service (at 13) to decisions permitting Congress to “limit and restrict the \npower of removal” with respect to inferior officers and employees.  United States v. \nPerkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886).  But that precedent is impossible to square with \nthe Administration’s limitless theory of removal under which anyone who exercises \nany executive power must be removable at will by the President.  Even if members of \nthis  Court  wish  to  revisit Humphrey’s Executor  in  some  manner,  it  would  be \nparticularly  dangerous  to  do  so  in  a  stay  with  such  limited  briefing,  given  the \npotentially far-reaching consequences.   \nb.  The government (at 17-18) claims the Merit Systems Protection Board \nexercises “substantial executive power.”  But it told the court below that the Board is \n“predominantly an adjudicatory body,” App.94a (Millett, J., dissenting) (quoting stay \noral argument), and even Judge Henderson agreed the Board’s “powers are relatively” \n“circumscribed,” App.76a (Henderson, J., concurring).  There is no way to invalidate \n  20 \n\nthe  Board  based  on  the  nature  of  the  powers  it  exercises  without  effectively \noverturning Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener.    \nFirst, the fact that the Board exercises “adjudicatory power,” “reviews * * * \nappeals” brought by employees, and “reviews proceedings brought by the Office of \nSpecial Counsel” does not render the Board unconstitutional.  Application at 17 \n(quotation marks omitted).  On the contrary.  A multimember board hearing cases is \nthe ne plus ultra of a permissible “adjudicatory body.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  \nAdjudicating cases does not render the Board unconstitutional; it underscores the \nreverse.  See Freytag v. Comm’r, 501 U.S. 868, 891 (1991) (explaining “the Tax Court \n* * * is * * * an adjudicative body * * * [that] does not make political decisions.”). \nContra the government (at 20), the Board exercises even less authority than \nthe War Claims Commission in Wiener.  The Commission issued completely non-\nreviewable decisions from its perch within the executive branch.  Id. at 354-355.  The \nBoard’s decisions are reviewable in Article III courts.  The government also attempts \n(at 20) to distinguish the Board from the War Claims Commission on the basis that \nthe Commission was only “temporary.”  But the government “nowhere explains why \nthe length of an agency’s mandate matters.”  App.102a (Millett, J., dissenting). \nSecond, the government argues (at 19) that the Board exercises substantial \nexecutive power because it hears matters involving “the hiring and firing of” federal \n“employees.”  But the Board no more interferes with the President’s management of \nthe executive branch than an Article III court interferes with educational institutions’ \nadmissions when it enforces foundational civil rights laws.  See Students for Fair \n  21 \n\nAdmissions v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).  If anything, the Board stands on firm \nfooting precisely because Congress has constitutional authority to “limit, restrict, and \nregulate the removal” of federal employees and inferior officers, and the Board is an \nintegral part of the statutory scheme Congress has enacted.  Perkins, 116 U.S. at 485. \nThird,  the  government  complains  (at  17)  the  Board  “may  send  its  own \nattorneys to” “lower federal courts” in complex procedural appeals, where the Board’s \nattorneys have unique expertise, and in circumstances in which the Director of the \nOffice of Personnel Management petitions a court to review a Board decision.   \nThere are no constitutional concerns here.  The Board’s modest ability to \nrepresent itself when sued looks nothing like the litigation authority the executive \nbranch wields through the Department of Justice, which launches investigations and \nprosecutes cases.  Moreover, the ability to appear before courts is a typical feature of \nindependent agencies, which only underscores the degree to which adopting the \ngovernment’s position here would require overturning Humphrey’s Executor.10  Nor \nis it a uniquely executive function.  Federal courts retain attorneys on their behalf in \nmandamus cases, and Congress litigates in court.   \nFourth, the government takes aim (at 17-18) at the fact that the Office of \nSpecial Counsel can request a single member of the Board to enter a temporary stay \nin personnel actions, which the full Board may “terminate[]” “at any time.”  5 U.S.C. \n \n10 See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 2061(a) (CPSC); 42 U.S.C. § 7171(i) (FERC); 5 U.S.C. § 7105(h) \n(FLRA); 46 U.S.C. § 41307(a), (d) (FMC); 12 U.S.C. § 248(p) (Federal Reserve); 15 \nU.S.C. § 53(b) (FTC); 29 U.S.C. § 154(a) (NRLB); 49 U.S.C. § 1301(c)(1) (STB); 39 \nU.S.C. § 409 (USPS).   \n  22 \n\n§ 1214(b)(1)(D).  But the ability of a single judge to grant a temporary stay is a typical \nfeature of multimember adjudicatory bodies.  See, e.g., Sup. Ct. Rs. 22.5, 23.1.  In this \ncase, for example, the Chief Justice entered an administrative stay on his own \nauthority, subject to the full Court’s review.  And a Board member’s ability to enter a \ntemporary stay, subject to the review of the full Board, looks nothing like the vast \npower wielded by single directors that troubled the Court in Seila Law and Collins.   \nThe argument fails for another reason: only the Special Counsel (not Harris or \nany other Board official) may seek this kind of stay, 5 U.S.C. § 1214(b)(1)(A)(i), and \nthe President has appointed his preferred acting Special Counsel.  The D.C. Circuit \nrecently held that the President could remove the Special Counsel because he was a \nsingle director head of a prosecutorial agency.  See Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052, \n2025 WL 887518 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (per curiam).  As a result, the President \nhas installed an acting Special Counsel, who in turn completely controls the ability \nto request stays.  If the government does not want more of these stays, the President’s \nacting Special Counsel simply need not seek them.  The government’s theoretical \nconcern is therefore solved by the President’s existing powers, and there is certainly \nno need for emergency relief from this Court. \nFifth,  the  government  argues  (at  17)  that  the  Board’s  structure  is \nunconstitutional  because  the  Board  may sua sponte  review  Office  of  Personnel \nManagement regulations to ensure compliance with laws Congress passed regulating \nprohibited  practices,  such  as  discrimination  and  retaliation.    But  this  purely \n“negative power” is also adjudicatory.  App.77a (Henderson, J., concurring).  This \n  23 \n\nauthority is effectively never employed.  We could find one instance, almost a half-\ncentury ago, upholding a regulation.  In re Exceptions from Competitive Merit Plans, \n9 M.S.P.R. 116 (MSPB 1981).  To top it off, the government may seek “judicial review” \nof the Board’s decisions.  App.99a (Millett, J., dissenting).  Regardless, if the Court \nwere truly worried about that vestigial function (or any similar one), the solution—\nconsistent with principles of constitutional avoidance and judicial modesty—is not to \nblow up the century-plus structure of agencies, but to invalidate the particular \nexercise of that function should it ever be used.  See United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1, 24-26 (2021).  At the least, a never exercised vestigial function is certainly \nnot such a pressing concern that it requires emergency relief.   \nThe bottom line: There is no way the government can succeed under existing \nlaw, and the Court should not upset longstanding precedent in a stay motion. \nB.  Article III Courts Are Not Powerless To Enforce The Law. \nThe District Court granted Harris an injunction and declaratory relief, and \nexplained that it would award “mandamus as an alternative remedy” if necessary.  \nApp.214a.  This relief is rooted in centuries of Anglo-American history and tradition.  \n1.  Courts May Issue “Full And Complete” Relief In Removal Cases. \nThe District Court properly provided relief by enjoining subordinate executive \nofficials from “denying or obstructing Harris’s access” to “her office.”  App.214a.  This \ntype of injunction does not run against the President.  Instead, the order requires \nsubordinate officials to permit Harris “ ‘to exercise the privileges’ ” of her office.  \nSeverino, 71 F.4th at 1043 (quoting Swan, 100 F.3d at 980).  This injunction neither \n  24 \n\nreinstates Harris to office, nor requires the President to exercise his appointments \npower.  Rather, because the President’s putative removal was “illegal and void” under \nHumphrey’s Executor, “the office never became vacant,” Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. \nD.C. 310, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1914), and “Harris was never in fact removed.”  App.205a \nn.13.  The order simply requires subordinate officials to honor that reality.  As Judge \nSilberman has explained, this kind of injunction provides Harris “all the relief” she \nwill “ever need” “without ever attempting to impose judicial power directly on the \nPresident of the United States.”  Swan, 100 F.3d at 989 (Silberman, J., concurring).   \nThe law permitting injunctive relief in this context is so settled that the \ngovernment agreed in the D.C. Circuit that the District Court could provide equitable \nrelief “as a matter of circuit precedent.”  Supp.App.7a; see Severino, 71 F.4th at 1043; \nSwan, 100 F.3d at 980.  Indeed, “[i]njunctions against subordinate executive officials \nto prevent illegal action by the Executive Branch are” commonplace.  App.125a \n(Millett, J., dissenting); see, e.g., Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 567 (2006); \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 583 (1952); Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 828 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring \nin judgment) (“Review of * * * Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a suit \nseeking to enjoin the officers who attempt to enforce the President’s directive.”). \nThis Court’s precedent confirms such injunctions are available in removal \ncases.  In Sampson v. Murray, the Court recognized that “in disputes over tenure of \ngovernmental employees,” courts of law rather than courts of equity historically \nprovided relief.  415 U.S. at 71.  But then-Justice Rehnquist explained for the Court \n  25 \n\nthat “[m]uch water has flowed over the dam,” and that modern “federal courts do have \nauthority to review the claim of a discharged governmental employee.”  Id.at 71.   \nConsider Service v. Dulles, on which Sampson relied.  In that case, a foreign \nservice officer had sought both injunctive and declaratory relief, Service, 354 U.S. at \n389,  and  obtained  that  relief  on  remand  after  this  Court  held  his  termination \nunlawful, Service, B-134614 (Comp. Gen.), 1958 WL 1888 (Mar. 3, 1958).  Similarly, \nin Vitarelli v. Seaton, a federal employee sought judgment declaring his dismissal \nunlawful and “an injunction requiring his reinstatement,” and the Court held that he \nwas “entitled to the reinstatement which he seeks.”  359 U.S. at 537, 546; see also \nMiller v. Clinton, 687 F.3d 1332, 1360 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) \n(noting  public  servants  facing  “unconstitutional  discrimination”  may  obtain  “an \ninjunction”).  In short, the District Court had authority power to issue an injunction.  \nb.  There is a long tradition of courts issuing similar relief styled as mandamus.  \nAs the District Court detailed, to “the extent that English equity courts declined to \nissue  injunctions,”  “a  court  of  law”  “would  readily  issue  mandamus  instead.”  \nApp.204a (collecting precedent).  After the merger of law and equity, an injunction “is \nessentially” “mandamus in this context”—meaning that history supports the District \nCourt’s authority to issue an injunction.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 976 n.1.  But the “broader \npoint” is that the court possessed the authority to “provide Harris some form of \neffective relief,” regardless of the precise label.  App.206a.  \nThere is “overwhelming” English authority that “mandamus” lies where a \nperson removable only for “causes specified” “is wrongfully dispossessed.”  Kalbfus, \n  26 \n\n42 App. D.C. at 319 (quoting R v. Blooer, (1760) 97 Eng. Rep. 697; 2 Burr. 1043, 1045).  \n“[M]andamus” provides a “full and effectual remedy.”  Blackstone, supra, *264; see, \ne.g., R v. Mayor, Bailiffs and Common Council of the Town of Liverpool, (1759) 97 \nEng. Rep. 533; 2 Burr. 730-732.11  That English tradition of mandamus crossed the \nAtlantic and is etched into the cornerstone of judicial review.  Marbury v. Madison \ninvolved a Senate-confirmed official whose commission was wrongfully withheld—a \ncircumstance analogous to wrongful removal.  According to Chief Justice Marshall, \nthat scenario presented “a plain case for a mandamus.” Marbury, 5 U.S. at 173.  \nNumerous other cases abound.12   \nc.  Finally, the District Court had the authority to enter declaratory relief.  It \nis the basic duty of this Court to “say what the law is,” Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177, and \nour  system  relies  on  “executive”  “officials”  abiding  “by  an  authoritative \ninterpretation” of the law, Franklin, 505 U.S. at 803 (plurality op.).  Notably, although \n \n11 See Oliver Field, Civil Service Law, ch. XI § V (1939) (“Mandamus to reinstate” is \n“commonly used remedy in civil service removal cases.”); James L. High, A Treatise \non Extraordinary Remedies 71 (2d ed. 1884) (“[C]ivil courts” may “restore one [to \noffice]  who  has  been  wrongfully  removed.”);  Samuel  Slaughter  Merril,  Law of \nMandamus 182 (1892) (Officer “will be restored” “by the writ of mandamus.”); Thomas \nTapping, The Law and Practice of the High Prerogative Writ of Mandamus 240 (1853) \n(Mandamus lies as a “remedy for a wrongful dispossession of an office.”); John Shortt, \nInformations (Criminal and Quo Warranto), Mandamus and Prohibition 302 (1888) \n(“mandamus”  is  “true  specific  remedy”  for  person  “wrongfully  dispossessed” \n(quotation marks omitted)).   \n12 Fuller v. Trs. of Acad. Sch. in Plainfield, 6 Conn. 532, 547 (Conn. 1827) (mandamus \nproper where “no just cause is shewn”); State ex rel. Gill v. Common Council of City \nof Watertown, 9 Wis. 254, 258 (Wis. 1859) (“[A] mandamus is a proper remedy.”); \nRansom v. Mayor of Boston, 79 N.E. 823, 823 (Mass. 1907) (mandamus to “reinstate” \nplaintiff “unlawfully ousted”);  Truitt v. City of Philadelphia, 70 A. 757, 761 (Pa. 1908) \n(mandamus “to reinstate” superintendent); see also Macfarland v. United States ex \nrel. Russell, 31 App. D.C. 321, 322 (D.C. Cir. 1908) (mandamus for police officer).  \n  27 \n\nthe government purports to now challenge declaratory relief, the government’s merits \nbrief below accepted the availability of that remedy.  See Gov. D.C. Cir. Br. at 40 n.7.   \n2.  The Government’s Arguments Are Wrong. \nThe government’s arguments are wrong, and at the very least the government \nfalls short of the necessary “ ‘strong showing’ ” of success.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 426.   \nFirst, the government argues (at 21-22) that courts may award only backpay \nbecause other remedies “violate[] Article II” by compelling the President to retain \n“someone he has fired.”  But that restates the merits question, i.e., may the President \nremove Harris on a whim.  Because Congress can protect against arbitrary removal, \nHarris remaining in office does not violate Article II.   \nThe  government’s  argument  defies  historical  practice.    Presidents  have \nhonored Humphrey’s Executor for nearly a century.  It cannot be that every other \nchief executive could have cut some checks for trivial sums to evade removal statutes \nCongress enacted.  Let’s be honest:  A backpay-only rule would gut Humphrey’s \nExecutor by turning every removal statute into unenforceable dead letter.  The Court \nshould be cautious of ruling for the government on this basis because it would \nforeclose any ability for the Court to later preserve some of Humphrey’s Executor by \nidentifying a subset of removal statutes that remain lawful and enforceable.   \nSecond, the government argues for a backpay-only rule on the theory that there \nis no “historical precedent” for issuing other relief to principal officers.  Application \nat  23  (quotation  marks  omitted).    But  that  is  wrong.    William  Marbury  “was \nnominated by the President, and confirmed by the Senate,” App.127a (Millett J., \n  28 \n\ndissenting), and Chief Justice Marshall dubbed Marbury’s wrongful removal “a plain \ncase for mandamus.”  Marbury, 5 U.S. at 173.13 \nIndeed, the government elsewhere acknowledges that Anglo-American courts \nhave issued meaningful relief in the form of mandamus for centuries, including to \nSenate-confirmed officers.  But the government then says (at 30) a court may only \nuse “mandamus to try the title to judicial or local offices.”  The government, however, \ncannot cite any authority to support this arbitrary limitation.  Our history and \ntraditions matter.  The government’s remedies theory is not rooted in them.  It is \ngerrymandered to fit this case.  But to the extent that Harris’s circumstances are \nunprecedented, that fact rebounds on the government.  It underscores that no other \nPresident has attempted to gut independent agencies. \nThird, to support a backpay only rule, the government (at 21) points to the fact \nthat “removed executive officers (or their executors) have challenged their removal \nby seeking back pay.”  See also App. 12a (Rao, J., dissenting).  But the plaintiffs in \nMarbury and Wiener sought to return to office by bringing suits at law, and there is \na lengthy Anglo-American tradition of officials doing the same.  See supra p.29 n.13.   \nThe government’s parenthetical, moreover, gives the game away.  There was a \nreason William Humphrey’s executor sued for backpay in the landmark case bearing \nhis name.  Humphrey had passed away at the time of the suit’s filing, and Humphrey \n \n13 Similarly, in Wiener, the plaintiff originally brought a legal proceeding to recover \nhis Senate confirmed position on the War Claims Commission, which became moot \nupon the Commission’s abolition.  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 351 n.*.   \n  29 \n\ncould not return to office.14  Everyone knew the case was about much more than a \nright to backpay.  “Humphrey’s case was a cause célèbre” because it decided the \nbroader rule that the President may not arbitrarily dismiss members of quasi-judicial \nand quasi-legislative bodies.  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 353; see App.232a (“[T]hese cases \nrepresent far more than grievances over backpay and routine personnel issues.”).   \nFourth, the government argues (at 24-25) that injunctive and declaratory relief \nare unavailable because only courts of law provided relief historically.  But the \ngovernment conceded the availability of declaratory relief in its merits brief below, \nand cannot walk back that representation now.  Meanwhile, in Sampson, 415 U.S. at \n71, this Court acknowledged the historical limitation on courts of equity, but then \nexplained “[m]uch water has flowed over the dam since.”   \nRegardless, the government’s own sources prove that meaningful relief was \navailable via courts of law, which is more than enough to sustain the District Court’s \ndecision.  White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) and In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, \n212 (1888), expressly acknowledged the availability of mandamus.  The government’s \npreferred treatise quotes confirms that dispute over “title to office” are “cognizable” \n“by courts of law.”  2 James L. High, Treatise on the Law of Injunctions § 1312, at \n863 (2d ed. 1880).  In short, courts are not powerless in this circumstance.  \nThis case is therefore nothing like Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. \n \n14 Samuel F. Ratherburn Br., 1935 WL 32964, at *2, Humphrey’s Executor v. United \nStates, No. 667 (U.S. 1934) (lawsuit filed April 28, 1934, Humphrey died February \n14, 1934).  Similarly, in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 52 (1926), the plaintiff \nsued three months before his term ended (and then died during litigation).  It would \nhave made no sense to seek return to office with such little time left on the clock.    \n  30 \n\nBond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308 (1999).  In Grupo Mexicano, a federal court had sought \nto order a specific type of “relief that ha[d] never been available before” and was \n“specifically disclaimed by longstanding judicial precedent.”  Id. at 322.  By contrast, \nhere, there is a long history of Anglo-American courts ordering meaningful relief in \nremoval cases.  After the merger of law and equity, the distinction of labeling that \norder a writ of mandamus or an injunction is immaterial.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 976 n.1.   \nFifth, the government attempts (at 30) to brush aside the history of mandamus \nrelief in removal cases by arguing that Harris’s “right to relief” is not sufficiently clear \nfor mandamus to issue.  See also App.14a-15a (Rao, J., dissenting).  That is wrong.  \nHarris has a clear right to relief.  The removal statute is unambiguous.  The Court’s \nprecedent is binding.   \nMoreover, a right to relief can be sufficiently clear for mandamus to issue even \nif courts must perform some legal analysis along the way.  See In re Cheney, 406 F.3d \n723, 729 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (explaining that “mandamus actions” are not “ruled out \nwhenever the statute allegedly creating the duty is ambiguous”); Swan, 100 F.3d at \n364 (explaining that a “nonremoval duty of sufficient clarity” exists, even if “the \ninterpretation of the controlling statute is in doubt” (quotation marks omitted)).  This \nfact highlights how granting the government a stay based on its remedies arguments, \non such limited briefing, could accidentally upset other areas of law.  \n Sixth,  the  government  argues  (at  24)  that  because  Congress  “has  never \nenacted a Reinstatement Act under which principal executive officers may seek \nrestoration to office,” Congress did not want courts to provide such relief.  But \n  31 \n\nCongress  provided  express  statutory  authorization  for  mandamus  relief, see  28 \nU.S.C. § 1361, codifying the long history of courts issuing mandamus in this context.  \nSee Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U.S. 554, 560 (2019) (A “term” “transplanted” “brings \nthe old soil with it.”) (cleaned up).  As the government acknowledges (at 29), Congress \nalso enacted a statute permitting officers to bring a writ of quo warranto when two \ncompeting officers vie for the same position.  D.C. Code §§ 16-3501.  These statutes \nindicate Congress intended Courts to provide meaningful relief in removal cases.15    \nThere is also a long backdrop of courts issuing equitable relief to remedy ultra \nvires executive action, which provides a default norm that equitable relief is available \nunless  Congress  displaces  it.    See, e.g., Youngstown,  343  U.S.  at  583.    The \nAdministrative  Procedure  Act  authorizes  the  Court  to  “compel  agency  action \nunlawfully withheld,” 5 U.S.C. § 706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes \n“[f]urther necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment,” 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2202, providing additional statutory authority to grant relief.  If there were any \ndoubt,  the  removal  statute  itself  indicates  Congress  intended  courts  to  issue \nmeaningful relief.  Congress did not enact a removal statute to ensure that removed \nBoard members received a few dollars in backpay.  5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).  Congress \nsought to shield these adjudicators, and others like them, from “the Damocles’ sword \n \n15 Quo warranto normally applied if there was another, competing office holder to sue.  \nOsgood v. Jones, 60 N.H. 282, 288 (N.H. 1880); Public Office, 38 Harv. L. Rev. 693, \n693 (1925).  In addition to requesting mandamus, Harris asked the District Court for \nquo warranto if necessary.  See D. Ct. Dkt. 38 at 25 n.10.  The government is \nseparately wrong (at 29) to suggest plaintiffs must make a futile gesture of applying \nto the Attorney General for permission to sue, which would effectively bar “access to \ncourt.”  Andrade v. Lauer, 729 F.2d 1475, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1984).   \n  32 \n\nof removal.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356. \nThe government also reaches the wrong conclusion (at 24) from the fact that \nCongress has enacted statutes providing mechanisms for federal employees to seek \ncertain remedies, including reinstatement.  The statutes were necessary to outline \nthe  administrative  processes  federal  employees  must  exhaust  before  heading  to \nCourt, such as appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board.  See 5 U.S.C. §7701.  \nMembers of the Board, by contrast, can’t go to the Board.  Congress did not require \nexhaustion because there is nowhere for them to turn before an Article III forum.  \nCongress left the background rules in place for Board members, under which they \nproceed directly to court to stop ultra vires action. \n Seventh, the government argues (at 27-28) that allowing courts to issue relief \nwill  cause  “chaos,”  and  warns  that  “courts  may  feel  pressure  to  rush  to  final \njudgment.”  This is chutzpah.  Any pressure in this case is due to the Administration’s \nchoices.  Instead of creating circumstances conducive to orderly litigation, for example \ndelaying the purported removal or holding it in abeyance pending the outcome of the \ncase, the Administration has pressed forward at breakneck speed and asked for \ncertiorari before judgment on an extremely expedited timeline.   \nNor will issuing meaningful relief to Harris, and affirming the en banc D.C. \nCircuit, “risk damaging the public confidence that is vital to the functioning of the \nJudicial Branch.”  Application 28 (quotation marks omitted).  Quite the opposite.  It \nwould undermine public confidence if the Court declares Congress’ longstanding \nhandiwork unconstitutional, overturns the Humphrey’s Executor framework in an \n  33 \n\nemergency stay motion, and greenlights the President to remake everything from the \nFederal  Reserve  to  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board,  when  no  other \nPresident has done anything like this.  This is the wrong way, and the wrong moment, \nto revisit settled law regarding the separation of powers. \nThe government also suggests that suits for backpay create “time between the \npolitical resolution and the judicial review,” reducing the appearance that the Court \nis meddling in politics.  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  This is misleading.  The \ngovernment is not suggesting that a lawsuit for backpay will test the legal question \nwhether the President may fire Harris, after which the President will then abide by \nthe Court’s authoritative statement of the law.  The government’s position is that \nbackpay is all Harris or anyone else can ever get—and the President can always defy \nthe law, so long as the Treasury pays a trivial sum.  Regardless, to the extent “time” \ninsulates the Court from blowback that is only a further confirmation that issuing an \nextraordinary stay and granting certiorari before judgment are both bad ideas.    \nII.  The Remaining Factors Weigh Against A Stay. \nThe remaining stay factors confirm a stay is unwarranted. \nA.  The government will not suffer irreparable harm in the few short months \nin which this case is decided in the D.C. Circuit.  Denying a stay simply preserves a \nlegal status quo that has endured for more than a century.  The government’s theory \nof injury (at 33) to the President’s Article II prerogatives is, once more, bound up with \nits view of the merits.  There is no meaningful harm to the Administration in \nfollowing binding precedent, unless and until this Court overturns it.  Application at \n  34 \n\n33 (quotation marks omitted).  It is particularly telling that no other chief executive—\nincluding President Trump in his first term—has asserted the need to immediately \nremove members of independent boards and commissions in this manner.   \nOrdering the executive branch to follow the law will not harm “our democratic \nsystem.”  Application at 33.  The Board is not a headless fourth branch of government \nobstructing President Trump.  The Board does not set policy.  The Board is a modest \nadjudicatory body like that in Wiener—subject to even greater degrees of Presidential \ncontrol and judicial review than the War Claims Commission—which hears appeals \nregarding arbitrary dismissal, retaliation, and discrimination.   \nThe government tries to paint as nefarious (at 34-35) the fact that Harris \nissued a temporary stay of removal.  Because she is an adjudicator, Harris will let \nher decision speak for itself.16  But note two things:  First, the President has now \ninstalled his preferred acting Special Counsel, who in turn completely controls the \nability to request stays.  If the government does not want more stays, the acting \nSpecial  Counsel  can  decide  not  to  seek  them.   See supra  pp.  23.    Second,  the \ngovernment offers not a word about the substance of Harris’s legal decision.  It should \ngo without saying, but we say it anyway:  The job of an adjudicator, including those \nhoused within Article II, is to apply law to facts, without fear or favor.  Article II \narbiters do not “thwart the elected President’s agenda,” Application at 35, if the law \nrequires an outcome the President dislikes, any more than an Article III court does \n \n16 See Special Couns. ex rel. John Doe v. Dep’t of Agric., No CB-1208-25-20-U-1 \n(MSPB Mar. 5, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/4kdjsvyh. \n  35 \n\nwhen  it  strikes  down  an  administration’s  preferred  policy,  see, e.g.,  Biden  v. \nNebraska, 600 U.S. 477 (2023); West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nB.  Harris will suffer great harm from a stay.  Harris took an oath of office to \nfulfill specific functions set out by Congress.  If she is barred from performing her \nduties, no amount of money will repair that injury, or undo the violence to the statute \nCongress enacted.  Nor is “back pay” a sufficient remedy—as the long history of \nmandamus shows—precisely because these injuries are not reparable by dollars and \ncents.  Application at 38.  Consider an analogy:  No one would tell an Article III judge \nthat backpay would suffice if the judge were improperly barred from chambers. \nA stay would also irrevocably mar the independence that Congress deemed \nnecessary  for  Harris  and  the  other  members  of  the  Board  to  perform  their \nadjudicatory functions without fear or favor.  If the executive may illegally bar \nadjudicators  from  office  and  then  receive  a  stay,  that  independence  would  be \n“effectively lost,” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985), and every adjudicator \nwill live underneath the “Damocles’ sword of removal.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.17 \nC.  A stay is not in the “public interest.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 436.  It would \ngreenlight chaos, including the potential destruction of the independent Federal \nReserve on which the national economy relies.  A stay pending appeal will divest the \nBoard of a quorum (indeed, the administrative stay already has done just that).  That \nresult will trap “in legal limbo millions of” federal workers who “must go to” the Board \n \n17 Contra the government (at 35-36), Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997), “supports \nHarris’s claim to injury.”  App.210a.   \n  36 \n\nto resolve “employment disputes.”  App.84a.  Amazingly, just last month, the Solicitor \nGeneral urged this Court to vacate a district court decision reinstating fired federal \nemployees because employees needed to proceed through the Board process.  See \nApplication, OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904 (U.S. Mar. 24, 2025).  Those employees may \nnow find themselves in an intolerable Catch-22.  The government’s suggestion (at 36) \nthat the Senate should confirm new members to the Board to restore a quorum is cold \ncomfort to the millions of employees stuck in the meantime.  And for comparison, the \nlast time the Board lost a quorum, it resulted in a massive backlog of 3,800 cases that \nthe Board has only just cleared.  App.184a.   \nThe  government  suggests  (at  35)  that  federal  employees  might  challenge \nHarris’s  participation  in  decisions  during  this  litigation.    This  late-breaking \nargument, not made in the District Court, see Gov. Opp., D. Ct. Dkt. 33 at 20-21, is \nforfeited on appeal.  It is also wrong.  This Court’s decisions remain binding law \nunless and until that Court overturns them, and any problems could also be resolved \nby the de facto officer doctrine.  Buckley, 424 U.S. at 142.  Moreover, if any employee \ndoes object to Harris hearing a case (to our knowledge, none have), the Board could \nchoose to hold that particular matter in abeyance.  This concern again is entirely of \nthe government’s own making because the Administration chose not to pause the \npurported removal until litigation was resolved.  Finally, the countervailing here-\nand-now need for the Board to operate outweighs any such speculative harms. \nD.  A stay is also unwarranted because the Court may well deny review should \nthe D.C. Circuit affirm the judgment.  Mills, 142 S. Ct. at 18 (Barrett, J., concurring).  \n  37 \n\nThe Courts of Appeal have uniformly rejected the legal arguments now advanced by \nthe government; this Court has declined to overturn Humphrey’s Executor; and the \ngovernment (until this case) urged this Court against upsetting settled precedent.   \nMoreover, to the extent that critics of Humphrey’s Executor worry that some \nindependent agencies make policy without sufficient presidential oversight, other \nlegal doctrines reduce the scope of agencies’ authority, such as: the major questions \ndoctrine, Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 504; the non-delegation doctrine, Paul v. United \nStates, 140 S. Ct. 342, 205 (2019) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the denial of certiorari); \nthe jury trial right, SEC v. Jarkesy, 603 U.S. 109, 140 (2024); and the overruling of \nChevron deference, Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024).  To \nbe  very  clear,  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board does not set policy.    The \ngovernment  agrees  the  Board  is  “predominantly  an  adjudicatory  body.”  \nSupp.App.5a.  But if this Court is worried about other agencies, the Court has many \navenues to ameliorate its concerns short of overturning Humphrey’s Executor. And \ngiven the severe recency of decisions like Nebraska, Jarkesy, and Loper Bright, the \nissues here should percolate, and certainly should not be decided on a rushed basis. \nThe government argues the case is cert-worthy (at 31-32) now because it \ninvolves the separation of powers and remedies.  This Court should be wary of \naccepting the suggestion these topics are certiorari cheat codes.  Doing so would invite \nPresidents to defy precedent, seek stays, and force the Court to intervene.  The \ngovernment (at 32) suggests the Court should grant a stay to decide “the interim \nstatus of the removals.”  But that would undo Congress’ handiwork, without full \n  38 \n\nbriefing and argument.  This Court can have the last word, in the ordinary process.  \nIII.  The Court Should Not Grant Certiorari Before Judgment. \nThe  Court  should  reject  the  extraordinary  request  for  certiorari  before \njudgment.  The law is settled, and there is no need for this Court to hear this case on \na rushed timetable, especially at the end of the Term.  The Solicitor General himself \nsays “time between” “political” action and “judicial” resolution fosters legitimacy, \nApplication at 28 (quotation marks omitted)—a point that strongly counsels against \ndeviating from normal processes.  In contrast, adopting extraordinary procedural \nmeasures in a fraught moment, to say nothing of overturning longstanding precedent \nin the blink of an eye, risks undermining faith in the judiciary.  Indeed, a key purpose \nof certiorari jurisdiction is to enable the Court to choose what to decide when.  Even \nif  some  members  of  this  Court  wish  to  revisit Humphrey’s Executor,  denying \ncertiorari before judgment does not prevent the Court from doing so in the future, \neven in this very case.  It just means the Court need not do so right now.  \nThe appeal is also briefed before the D.C. Circuit, which will hear argument \nMay 16.  Even if the Court ultimately takes this case, waiting a few short months will \npermit the D.C. Circuit to consider important issues, including the effect of ruling for \nthe government on the Federal Reserve and adjudicators like Tax Court judges, and \nthe broader ramifications of the government’s remedies theory.   \nMoving even faster than the highly expedited schedule set by the D.C. Circuit \nwould sharply deviate from past practice in major structural challenges.  In Free \nEnterprise Fund, this Court took 539 days from the petition for certiorari to decision, \n  39 \n\nand in Seila Law, it took 367 days.  That was after exhaustive consideration in the \nlower courts.  In Free Enterprise Fund there were 1602 days between the complaint’s \nfiling and judgment.  In Seila Law, there were 1134 days.  By contrast, the complaint \nhere was filed on February 11, and the Solicitor General is seeking to truncate the \nprocess by tenfold, seeking a full-blown merits determination that calls into question \ndecades of constitutional law in a blitzkrieg lasting four months, start-to-finish.  \nRushing such important matters risks making mistakes and destabilizing \nother areas of the law.  Cf. U.S. Opp. to Cert. Before Judgment, Am. Inst. For Inter. \nSteel v. United States at 14, No. 18-1317 (U.S. May 28, 2019) (“Even where a litigant \nseeks to challenge” “precedents” “the Court ordinarily awaits the completion of the \nappellate process.”).  One telling example: The Solicitor General’s brief before this \nCourt says not one word about the implications of its theory for the Federal Reserve.  \nAnd none of the many briefs filed before the D.C. Circuit on an expedited basis made \nthe point that the Government’s remedy argument would give the President power to \nfire Federal Reserve Board officers regardless of the merits, simply by cutting a check \nfor backpay.  There’s a reason why this Court takes time in cases of this magnitude.  \nCf. Donald Trump’s Opp. to Cert. Before Judgment, United States v. Trump at 1, No. \n23-624 (U.S. Dec. 20, 2023) (urging Court to employ “ordinary review procedures”).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe government’s application should be denied. \n  40 \n\n          Respectfully submitted, \nMICHAEL J.

Mr. McArthur for the \n11  appellants, Mr. Zelinsky for Appellee Harris, and Mr. Gupta \n12  for Appellee Wilcox.   \n13      JUDGE HENDERSON:  All right.  Mr. McArthur, good \n14  morning.   \n15  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MCARTHUR, ESQ. \n16  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS \n17      MR. MCARTHUR:  Good morning, Your Honors, and may \n18  it please the Court.  Eric McArthur for the defendants.  The \n19  Court should stay the judgments below pending appeal because \n20  the government is likely to prevail on the merits and \n21  because the balance of harms and the public interest favor a \n22  stay. \n23      On the merits, the government is likely to prevail \n24  for two independent reasons -- first, because Article II \n25  empowers the President to remove members of the NLRB and \n \n\nSupp.App.5a\n \n  12 \n1  was -- \n2      MR. MCARTHUR:  Perhaps predominantly, but -- \n3      JUDGE MILLETT:  -- in Humphrey's and Wiener.  They \n4  are -- \n5      MR. MCARTHUR:  -- but -- \n6      JUDGE MILLETT:  -- they're predominantly -- the \n7  MSPB and NLRB are -- the Board, as it acts, is predominantly \n8  adjudicative.  The MSPB, that's all it does. \n9      MR. MCARTHUR:  Well, that's not all it does, but I \n10  think -- \n11      JUDGE MILLETT:  It makes some rules to govern its \n12  own proceedings -- \n13      MR. MCARTHUR:  It -- \n14      JUDGE MILLETT:  -- as do -- does this Court. \n15      MR. MCARTHUR:  It does some other things that are \n16  executive powers, but to go back to Your Honor's point  \n17  about -- \n18      JUDGE MILLETT:  But not predominantly. \n19      MR. MCARTHUR:  I agree with that.  I think the \n20  MSPB is -- \n21      JUDGE MILLETT:  I -- \n22      MR. MCARTHUR:  -- predominantly an adjudicatory \n23  body, but the issue here is how you apply the Supreme \n24  Court's precedents when the holdings are left intact, but \n25  the rationale has been repudiated, and -- \n \n\nSupp.App.6a\n \n  36 \n1  officials to treat the plaintiffs as de facto members of \n2  their boards -- de facto.  The Court in both cases drew a \n3  very clear distinction between being de facto reinstated and \n4  actually being officially clothed with the authority of the \n5  office.  The decisions below, both of them, take that next \n6  step here and say this isn't just de facto, this is -- we \n7  are ordering that these plaintiffs remain members of these \n8  boards and shall continue to serve as members unless and \n9  until they are removed for cause. \n10      JUDGE MILLETT:  So for your stay motion, you don't \n11  quibble with the de facto, I mean, put aside -- I know there \n12  are arguments on other prongs, but for this prong -- \n13      MR. MCARTHUR:  I would say -- \n14      JUDGE MILLETT:  -- de facto, we got circuit \n15  precedent binding -- if to the extent the court, the \n16  district court's decisions are read as de facto \n17  reinstatement and only operating upon other executive \n18  officers, you don't quibble and you don't quibble with the \n19  declaratory judgment saying that what happened here was \n20  unlawful, unlawful for both of them, then it's just the \n21  official status?  The things that you're having is sort of \n22  de jure -- \n23      MR. MCARTHUR:  I think de jure is a problem and \n24  one of the ways in which those -- this goes beyond Severino \n25  and Swan. \n \n\nSupp.App.7a\n \n  37 \n1      JUDGE MILLETT:  Okay.   \n2      MR. MCARTHUR:  I would say that we do accept -- \n3      JUDGE MILLETT:  Yes. \n4      MR. MCARTHUR:  -- as a matter of circuit \n5  precedent, that the court would have power in appropriate \n6  circumstances to order that sort of partial relief that was \n7  contemplated, but whether the court has power to do it is a \n8  separate question from whether it's appropriate -- \n9      JUDGE MILLETT:  Just hang on one second.  I just \n10  want to make sure we didn't lose Judge Henderson here. \n11      MR. MCARTHUR:  Oh, no.   \n12      JUDGE MILLETT:  Judge Henderson, are you still on?   \n13      JUDGE HENDERSON:  Yes.   \n14      JUDGE MILLETT:  Okay.  Your picture has \n15  disappeared, so we wanted to make sure you were still here. \n16      I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   \n17      MR. MCARTHUR:  But there are -- \n18      JUDGE HENDERSON:  Okay.   \n19      MR. MCARTHUR:  -- the two other points that I \n20  wanted to make with respect to the remedy.  One is, the \n21  Court in Severino and Swan did not consider this separate \n22  line of authority, a long-standing limitation on the power \n23  of a court sitting in equity to interfere with the removal \n24  of a public officer.  This is about public officers \n25  generally.  It's not just about the President removing \n ",

TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL., APPLICANTS \n \nv. \n \nGWYNNE A. WILCOX AND CATHY A. HARRIS \n \n─────────── \n \nREPLY IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR STAY \n \n─────────── \nArticle II of the Constitution vests the “executive Power”—“all of it”—in the \nPresident alone.  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).  The district court \nheld otherwise.  It ruled that the President must have cause to fire the leaders of exec-\nutive agencies that dictate the terms of private employment relationships and control \naspects of federal employment, and it compelled the President to continue entrusting \nsignificant executive power to principal executive officers whom he considers unfit to \nwield it.  Those decisions were gravely erroneous, and they should be stayed. \nRespondents now claim the mantle of the status quo.  They argue that court-\nordered reinstatement of these principal officers is a minor and reasonable imposition \non the President’s constitutional prerogatives, and they warn of separation-of-powers \nchaos if Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), does not broadly \njustify removal restrictions across multimember agencies.   \n That doomsaying gets the merits and equities backwards.  Respondents treat \nHumphrey’s Executor as a precedent on par with Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 \n(1803).  Yet they refuse to take seriously this Court’s admonitions in Seila Law that \n“unrestricted removal” is the “general rule”; that Humphrey’s Executor is a narrow \n(1) \n\n2 \n“exceptio[n]” at the “ ‘outermost  * * *  limits’ ” of what the Constitution permits, if it \nis within those limits at all; that for-cause removal restrictions for principal officers \n(at most) extend to “multimember expert agencies,” like the 1935 Federal Trade Com-\nmission (FTC), that “do not wield substantial executive power”; and that courts and \nCongress cannot “elevate” Humphrey’s Executor “into a freestanding invitation” to \n“impose additional restrictions on the President’s removal authority.”  Id. at 215, 218, \n228 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  And while respondents focus heavily on other \nagencies such as the Federal Reserve Board, they ignore Seila Law’s observation that \nthe Federal Reserve’s tenure protection presents a distinct question with a unique \nhistorical pedigree.  See id. at 222 n.8.  That question is not at issue here. \nThe  agencies  actually  at  issue  here—the  National  Labor  Relations  Board \n(NLRB) and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)—wield substantial executive \npower in executing federal labor and civil-service laws, including the power to conduct \nagency adjudications, to make or block rules, and to litigate in federal court on behalf \nof the government.  Under Seila Law, those agencies cannot fit into the narrow ex-\nception of Humphrey’s Executor.   \nRespondents also ignore that reinstating removed principal officers is not a \nroutine restoration of the status quo.  Rather, it is a grave affront to the President’s \nability to run the Executive Branch and exceeds the limits on district courts’ equitable \npowers.  Respondents do not dispute that this Court has squarely held that a court of \nequity may not “restrain an executive officer from making a wrongful removal,” White \nv. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (citation omitted); that no federal statute grants \ncourts the authority to issue such an order; or that, until this Administration, no \nfederal court had issued an order reinstating a principal executive officer fired by the \nPresident.  Respondents instead argue that courts have traditionally tried the title to \n \n\n3 \npublic offices in actions for writs of mandamus.  But respondents cannot “defend the \ndistrict court’s exercise of its equitable remedial authority by pointing to a distinct \nlegal remedy” that “the district court never invoked”—not least because mandamus \ncarries heightened procedural and substantive standards they cannot meet.  Bessent \nv. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 517 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \nMoreover, the costs of such reinstatements are immense.  “The moment that \n[the President] loses confidence” in an executive officer, “he must have the power to \nremove [the officer] without delay.”  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 134 (1926).  \nForcing the President to entrust his executive power to respondents for the months \nor years that it could take the courts to resolve this litigation would manifestly cause \nirreparable harm to the President and to the separation of powers.  The President \nwould lose control of critical parts of the Executive Branch for a significant portion of \nhis term, and he would likely have to spend further months voiding actions taken by \nimproperly reinstated agency leaders.  By contrast, in the unlikely event that re-\nspondents were to ultimately prevail, they could seek the traditional remedy of back-\npay.  In short, their asserted harms during the pendency of litigation are remediable, \nwhile the President’s are not.  The Court should stay the district court’s judgments \nand grant certiorari before judgment. \nA.  Article II Empowers The President To Remove NLRB And MSPB \nMembers At Will \n1.  Respondents rely chiefly on Humphrey’s Executor, which they contend \nauthorizes Congress to grant tenure protection to “multimember agencies,” Wilcox \nOpp. 1, or “multimember boards or commissions,” Harris Opp. 2.  But Seila Law fore-\ncloses respondents’ position.  Seila Law described Humphrey’s Executor as a narrow \n“exceptio[n]” to the “general rule” of “unrestricted removal.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n \n\n4 \n215.  The Court explained that “the contours of the Humphrey’s Executor exception \ndepend upon the characteristics of the agency before the Court”—i.e., the FTC “as it \nexisted in 1935.”  Ibid.  It explained that the exception applied only to “ ‘officers of the \nkind  * * *  under consideration’ ” there—i.e., to members of “a multimember body of \nexperts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and judicial func-\ntions and was said not to exercise any executive power.”  Id. at 215-216 (citation omit-\nted).  The Court made clear that the exception represented the “ ‘outermost constitu-\ntional limi[t] of permissible congressional restrictions’ ” on the President’s power to \nremove principal executive officers, and it declined “to extend” that precedent any \nfurther.  Id. at 218, 220 (citation omitted).  Seila Law, in short, establishes that the \nHumphrey’s Executor exception extends, at most, to certain “multimember expert \nagencies that do not wield substantial executive power,” id. at 218 (emphasis added)—\nnot, as respondents now contend, to multimember agencies in general. \nOn respondents’ broad reading of Humphrey’s Executor, Congress could de-\nprive the President of control of the entire Executive Branch by converting every ex-\necutive department or agency into an independent multimember commission.  Con-\ngress could replace the Department of State with a Foreign Affairs Commission, the \nDepartment of Justice with a Federal Litigation Tribunal, the Department of Agri-\nculture with a National Food Board, and so on.  Respondents’ theory “provides no real \nlimiting principle” and “ ‘heightens the concern that [the Executive Branch] may slip \nfrom the Executive’s control, and thus from that of the people.’ ”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 229 n.11 (citation and emphasis omitted).   \nRespondents cite (Wilcox Opp. 14; Harris Opp. 11) the remedial portion of Seila \nLaw, in which three Justices stated that their “severability analysis does not foreclose \nCongress from pursuing alternative responses to the problem—for example, convert-\n \n\n5 \ning the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] into a multimember agency.”  591 \nU.S. at 237 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  But that statement means only what it says:  \nThe Court’s “severability analysis” did not “foreclose” Congress from reconstituting \nthe CFPB as a multimember agency.  Ibid.  The Court did not purport to decide in \nadvance whether Article II would allow Congress to grant tenure protection to such \na hypothetical multimember agency if Congress’s “alternative respons[e],” ibid., did \nnot also involve limiting the CFPB’s powers to go no further than the 1935 FTC’s \npowers.  Seila Law’s tentative observation that “there may be means of remedying \nthe defect in the CFPB’s structure,” ibid., cannot reasonably be read to override its \ndetailed description of the limits on Humphrey’s Executor’s scope, see id. at 215-217 \n(majority opinion).   \nRespondents note (Wilcox Opp. 12-13; Harris Opp. 15-16) that Congress has \ncreated independent multimember agencies since at least the Interstate Commerce \nCommission in 1887.  But the constitutional text controls over contrary historical \npractice, see INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 945-959 (1983), and practice from the \nFounding era controls over practice from long afterwards, see Powell v. McCormack, \n395 U.S. 486, 541-547 (1969).  This Court accordingly explained in Myers that late-\n19th-century legislative practice could not overcome Article II and the “decision of \n1789”—especially given that the practice “ha[d] never been acquiesced in by either \nthe executive or the judicial department.”  272 U.S. at 142, 176; see id. at 171-176.  \nAnd the Court in Seila Law reaffirmed the “general rule” of “unrestricted removal,” \n591 U.S. at 215, rejecting the dissenting Justices’ reliance on the same history that \nrespondents now invoke, see id. at 275-276 (opinion of Kagan, J.).  \nContrary to Harris’s suggestion (Opp. 6), there is nothing untoward about giv-\ning Humphrey’s Executor a “narro[w]” reading—not least when this Court has already \n \n\n6 \ndone so.  “When determining how broadly or narrowly to read a precedent,” this Court \n“will often consider how the precedent squares with the Constitution’s text and his-\ntory.”  United States v. Rahimi, 602 U.S. 680, 730 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).1  Because “text, first principles, the First Congress’s decision in 1789, [and] \nMyers” all establish that the President may remove executive officers at will, this \nCourt has confined Humphrey’s Executor to “ ‘officers of the kind’ ” considered there \nand has repeatedly declined to “extend” that precedent to “novel context[s].”  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 204, 215, 228 (citation omitted); see Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, \n561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (declining to extend Humphrey’s Executor to “a new situa-\ntion”).  Wilcox contends (Opp. 2) that stare decisis requires respecting Humphrey’s \nExecutor.  But stare decisis cuts the other way:  respondents cannot adopt an exces-\nsively narrow reading of Seila Law—treating it as a case only about single-headed \nagencies while ignoring all its reasoning—while insisting on a broad reading of \nHumphrey’s Executor that Seila Law already rejected.    \nRespondents’ disagreement about the extent of executive power involved un-\nderscores  their  problems  in  pigeonholing  the  agencies  at  issue  into  the  narrow \nHumphrey’s Executor exception.  Wilcox does not dispute that the NLRB’s authority \nexceeds the 1935 FTC’s, yet Harris argues (Opp. 3) that the MSPB “exercises far less \nsignificant authority.”  Harris is wrong.  While the 1935 FTC could order violators to \n“cease and desist” from unlawful practices, Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 620, \nthe MSPB may impose severe disciplinary sanctions—including suspension, removal, \n \n1  See, e.g., SEC v. Jarkesy, 603 U.S. 109, 136-140 (2024) (narrowing Atlas \nRoofing Co. v. OSHRC, 430 U.S. 442 (1977)); Vega v. Tekoh, 597 U.S. 134, 152 (2022) \n(narrowing Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)); Carson v. Makin, 596 U.S. 767, \n788-789 (2022) (narrowing Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 (2004)); Egbert v. Boule, 596 \nU.S. 482, 491 (2022) (narrowing Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal \nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)); Arizona Christian School Tuition Organi-\nzation v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 130 (2011) (narrowing Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968)). \n \n\n7 \ndebarment, and civil penalties—upon federal employees.  5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(3)(A).  \nWhile the 1935 FTC had to go to court to seek enforcement, see Humphrey’s Executor, \n295 U.S. at 620-621, the MSPB may enforce its own orders, see 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) \nand (e)(2).  And while Humphrey’s Executor did not allude to any authority that 1935 \nFTC Commissioners could exercise unilaterally, MSPB members may unilaterally \nstay executive agencies’ personnel actions—as Harris did when she blocked the firing \nof thousands of probationary employees without even giving the affected agency the \nopportunity to comment.  See Appl. 34.  Upholding respondents’ tenure protection \nwould require extending Humphrey’s Executor—the very step that Seila Law bars \ncourts from taking.    \n2.  Respondents next argue (Wilcox Opp. 17; Harris Opp. 9) that Congress \nmay insulate all primarily adjudicatory bodies from at-will presidential removal, and \nthat the NLRB and MSPB so qualify.  That putative exception too would vastly ex-\npand Humphrey’s Executor beyond its narrow bounds, and it would contradict other \nprecedents as well.  Agency adjudications are “exercises of  * * *  the ‘executive \nPower.’ ”  City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 305 n.4 (2013).  Article II accordingly \nrequires “political accountability and effective oversight for adjudication,” just like \nfor other exercises of the executive power.  United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, \n20 (2021).  Agency adjudicators “must remain ‘dependent on the President,’ ” id. at 17 \n(citation omitted), who “may consider [a] decision after its rendition as a reason for \nremoving the officer,” Myers, 272 U.S. at 135.   \nRegardless, respondents’ proposed exception does not even fit their agencies, \nbecause the NLRB and MSPB are not purely adjudicatory bodies.  The NLRB has the \npower to issue rules, the MSPB has the power to invalidate rules issued by the Office \nof Personnel Management, and both agencies have the power to litigate in federal \n \n\n8 \ncourt.  See Appl. 15-18.  Respondents describe (Wilcox Opp. 31; Harris Opp. 3) the \nNLRB  and  MSPB  as  “principally”  or  “predominantly”  adjudicatory  entities,  but \n“[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the relative importance” of an agency’s various \nfunctions.  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021).  The scope of the President’s \nremoval power accordingly cannot “hing[e] on such an inquiry.”  Ibid. \nMoreover, even on its own terms, respondents’ special rule for adjudicators is \nerroneous.  Respondents argue (Wilcox Opp. 2; Harris Opp. 19-20) that tenure pro-\ntection is essential to the fairness of agency adjudications.  But executive officers have \nconducted adjudications “since the beginning of the Republic.”  Arlington, 569 U.S. at \n305 n.4.  Until the 20th century, it was common for executive officers exercising such \nfunctions to be subject to at-will removal.  See Harold J. Krent, Presidential Control \nof Adjudication Within The Executive Branch, 65 Case W. Reserve L. Rev. 1083, 1089-\n1091 (2015).  Even today, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., \nallows agency heads—including heads without tenure protection—to preside at hear-\nings in lieu of administrative law judges, see 5 U.S.C. 556(b)(1)-(2), and to issue final \ndecisions, see 5 U.S.C. 557(b).   \nRespondents also err in claiming that agency adjudicators serve as “neutral \narbiter[s]” (Wilcox Opp. 2) who do not “set policy” (Harris Opp. 3).  Agencies “are \ngenerally free to develop regulatory standards ‘either by general legislative rule or by \nindividual order’ in an adjudication.”  FDA v. Wages & White Lion Investments, LLC, \nNo. 23-1038, slip op. 19 (Apr. 2, 2025) (citation omitted); see, e.g., NLRB v. Bell Aer-\nospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974) (adjudications often “serve as vehicles for the \nformulation of agency policies”) (citation omitted).  Moreover, even if respondents’ \nduties were limited to “apply[ing] the law” (Wilcox Opp. 2), Article II would still enti-\ntle the President to remove them at will.  Without that power, the President could \n \n\n9 \nnot fulfill his own duty to “take Care” that respondents are “faithfully execut[ing]” \nthe law.  U.S. Const. Art. II, § 3; see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 214.  \nContrary to respondents’ contention (Wilcox Opp. 1; Harris Opp. 1), Wiener v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), does not establish an exception to the President’s \nremoval power for adjudicators.  Seila Law treated Wiener as an “appli[cation]” of \nHumphrey’s Executor, not as an additional exception to the removal power.  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 216.  The NLRB’s and MSPB’s adjudicatory powers also far exceed \nthose of the War Claims Commission in Wiener.  The Commission was a temporary \nbody that awarded a government benefit (payment from a compensation fund).  See \n357 U.S. at 349-350.  The NLRB and MSPB, by contrast, are permanent agencies \nwhose orders can deprive individuals of liberty and property.  See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. \n160(c) (NLRB’s authority to award back pay); 5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(3)(A) (MSPB’s author-\nity to impose debarment and civil penalties).   \n3.  Respondents argue (Wilcox Opp. 2; Harris Opp. 1) that ruling for the \ngovernment would necessarily invalidate removal restrictions for the Board of Gov-\nernors of the Federal Reserve System.  See 12 U.S.C. 242.  But that distinct question \nis not presented here.  This Court has stated that “financial institutions like the  * * *  \nFederal Reserve” may be able to “claim a special historical status.”  Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 222 n.8.  If there is an “exception” to the President’s removal power for the \nFederal Reserve—a question that this Court need not decide, as in Seila Law—it \nwould be “an historical anomaly” that reflects “the unique function of the Federal \nReserve with respect to monetary policy.”  PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 192 n.17 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (en banc) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  The Federal Reserve is “not a \nmodel or precedent” for “a vast independent regulatory state.”  Ibid.; see CFPB v. \nCommunity Financial Services Ass’n of America, Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 467 n.16 (2024) \n \n\n10 \n(Alito, J., dissenting) (The Federal Reserve “is a unique institution with a unique \nhistorical background.”).   \nRespondents also analogize (Wilcox Opp. 2; Harris Opp. 15) the NLRB and \nMSPB to tenure-protected Article I tribunals like the Tax Court and the Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces.  But this Court has distinguished such tribunals from \nadministrative agencies.  For example, the Court has explained that administrative \nagencies exercise executive power, see Arlington, 569 U.S. at 305 n.4, but has stated \n(rightly or wrongly) that Article I tribunals “exercise the judicial power,” Freytag v. \nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 889 (1991).  Relatedly, the Court has held that free-\nstanding administrative agencies constitute “Departments” for purposes of the Ap-\npointments Clause, see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 511, but that entities like \nthe Tax Court are “Courts of Law,” see Freytag, 501 U.S. at 892.  And the Court has \nheld that Article III allows it to hear appeals from the Court of Appeals from the \nArmed Forces, see Ortiz v. United States, 585 U.S. 427, 431 (2018), but has distin-\nguished appeals from “adjudicative bodies in the Executive Branch  * * *  advancing \nan administrative (rather than judicial) mission,” id. at 448.  Whether or not Congress \nmay insulate Article I tribunals from removal—another question that the Court need \nnot resolve in these cases—those tribunals do not serve as precedents for regulatory \nagencies such as the NLRB and MSPB.  \nB.  The District Court’s Remedies Exceeded Its Authority \nThe government is independently likely to succeed in showing that the district \ncourt exceeded its remedial authority.  Respondents offer no convincing response to \nthe long line of precedents establishing that “a court of equity will not, by injunction, \nrestrain an executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate ap-\npointee.”  White, 171 U.S. at 377 (citation omitted); see, e.g., In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. \n \n\n11 \n200, 210 (1888).  They dismiss those precedents as “outdated,” Wilcox Opp. 20, and \nstate that “ ‘much water has flowed over the dam’ ” since then, Harris Opp. 26 (brack-\nets and citation omitted).  That response is at odds with their insistence that Humph-\nrey’s Executor circa 1935 must be given the fullest stare decisis effect, never mind \nintervening precedents cabining it.  Nor do respondents square their eagerness to \njettison cases like White with their insistence (Wilcox Opp. 2) that “precedents can’t \nbe casually cast aside on the emergency docket.”  The courts below remained bound \nby those precedents despite any intervening events, see State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 \nU.S. 3, 20 (1997), and the government has “a ‘likelihood of success’ ‘under existing \nlaw,’ ” Harris Opp. 2 (citations omitted).   \nContrary to respondents’ suggestion (Wilcox Opp. 21; Harris Opp. 4), Service \nv. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363 (1957), Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535 (1959), and Sampson \nv. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974), do not support the district court’s injunctions.  Those \ncases all involved employees, not principal executive officers.  See Service, 354 U.S. at \n372; Vitarelli, 359 U.S. at 536; Sampson, 415 U.S. at 62.  Service also considered only \n“the validity of the termination,” 354 U.S. at 372, and Vitarelli similarly focused on \n“the validity of [the] discharge,” 359 U.S. at 538; neither decision addressed the pro-\npriety of reinstatement as a remedy.  Sampson, meanwhile, explained that the re-\nviewability of personnel decisions in federal courts “does not, without more, create \nthe [reinstatement] authority” that “was held lacking in cases such as White.”  415 \nU.S. at 72.  Sampson additionally required the employee, “at the very least,” to satisfy \na heightened standard to overcome the “factors cutting against” injunctive relief “in \nGovernment personnel cases.”  Id. at 84.  Respondents do not satisfy even the usual \ntest for injunctive relief, much less Sampson’s heightened standard.  \nEqually mistaken is respondents’ claim (Wilcox Opp. 3; Harris Opp. 28) that \n \n\n12 \nthe government waived its objections to the district court’s declaratory judgments.  In \nfact, respondents have consistently sought reinstatement to office, and the govern-\nment has just as consistently objected to that relief, even if provided through a de-\nclaratory judgment.2  In the very footnote on which respondents rely (Wilcox Opp 22; \nHarris Opp. 4), the government stated that it “contested any declaratory judgment” \nthat provides “reinstatement.”  Gov’t C.A. Br. 40 n.7.  To the extent respondents now \nmean to argue that the district court could have granted a declaratory judgment that \nstopped short of ordering their reinstatement, they do not explain what such a judg-\nment would look like, why this Court should craft such a judgment in the first in-\nstance, or how such an abstract pronouncement would be jurisdictionally proper in \nthe absence of any other concrete relief.   \nRespondents also contend (Wilcox Opp. 20; Harris Opp. 26-27) that the district \ncourt could have issued writs of mandamus restoring them to office.  But this Court \nreviews the judgments that lower courts actually issued, not hypothetical relief.  The \ndistrict court issued injunctions and declaratory judgments, not writs of mandamus.  \nRespondents may not defend the equitable remedies that the court granted by point-\ning to a distinct legal remedy that it did not grant.  \nRespondents, in any event, have no right to mandamus.  First, as Harris con-\ncedes (Opp. 31), a court may award mandamus only if the litigant satisfies the high \nbar of showing a “clear and indisputable” right to relief.  United States ex rel. Bernar-\ndin v. Duell, 172 U.S. 576, 582 (1899).  Respondents have not cleared that hurdle.  \nSee Appl. App. 14a (Rao, J., dissenting).  Second, in deciding whether to award man-\n \n2  See, e.g., Gov’t C.A. Br. 40 (contesting “declar[atory]” relief); Gov’t Wilcox \nC.A. Stay Mot. 9 (contesting “declaratory relief ”); Gov’t Harris C.A. Stay Mot. 8 (con-\ntesting “declaratory relief ”); Gov’t Wilcox D. Ct. Stay Mot. 3 (contesting “declaratory” \nrelief); Gov’t Harris D. Ct. Stay Mot. 4 (contesting “declaratory judgment”). \n \n\n13 \ndamus, a court must consider “separation of powers” principles.  Cheney v. U.S. Dis-\ntrict Court, 542 U.S. 367, 381 (2004).  As the government has explained (Appl. 21-23), \nand as respondents do not seriously dispute, an order requiring the President to en-\ntrust executive power to a fired principal executive officer raises grave separation-of-\npowers concerns.  Third, respondents “have failed to identify a single case in which \nmandamus has been granted when an [executive] officer contests his removal by the \nPresident.”  Appl. App. 14a-15a (Rao, J., dissenting).  They cite (Wilcox Opp. 3; Harris \nOpp. 4) Marbury, which Chief Justice Taft already distinguished as involving “an \noffice [of ] the District of Columbia,” not an executive office of the United States.  My-\ners, 272 U.S. at 143.  The fact that respondents’ requested remedy “is without a prec-\nedent” “is of much weight against it.”  Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 500 (1867). \nHarris complains (Opp. 36) that back pay is not “a sufficient remedy.”  But that \nis the remedy that executive officers traditionally have sought when challenging their \nremovals.  For good reason:  Officers do not have a personal stake in maintaining the \npowers that come with their office, above and beyond their salaries.  See Appl. 35-36.  \nRegardless, “the question of whether a given remedy is adequate is a legislative de-\ntermination that must be left to Congress, not the federal courts.”  Egbert v. Boule, 596 \nU.S. 482, 498 (2022).  That is particularly true here, where the reinstatement remedy \nthat respondents seek would severely intrude on the President’s Article II powers.    \nC.  The Equities Support A Stay \n1.  Respondents argue that “there is no immediate urgency here,” Wilcox \nOpp. 23, and that the “government will not suffer irreparable harm in the few short \nmonths in which this case is decided in the D.C. Circuit,” Harris Opp. 34.  But this \nCourt has recognized that “sudden removals” are sometimes “necessary,” United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879), and that the President “must have the \n \n\n14 \npower to remove [executive officers] without delay,” Myers, 272 U.S. at 134.  Forcing \nthe President to postpone the removal of executive officers for months would “make \nimpossible that unity and co-ordination in executive administration essential to ef-\nfective action.”  Ibid.  The harm to the President is especially acute now, in the early \nmonths of his Administration.  Without the power to fire holdover officers, the new \nPresident could not “shape his administration and respond to the electoral will that \npropelled him to office.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 278 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part).  In \nany event, respondents’ prediction of a decision from the D.C. Circuit in “a few short \nmonths” is highly questionable, as that court has already granted en banc considera-\ntion of the government’s stay motion and may well do so again on the merits. \nWilcox errs in suggesting (Opp. 24) that the President’s ability to appoint new \nNLRB members solves the problem.  Such appointments require the Senate’s advice \nand consent, which typically take time to secure.  In the meantime, Wilcox’s rein-\nstatement irreparably harms the President by forcing him to leave the NLRB in the \ncontrol of the opposing political party.  See Appl. 33 (explaining that, with Wilcox, the \nNLRB would have two Democratic members and one Republican member).  It also \nirreparably harms the President by forcing him to continue entrusting executive \npower to an officer who has not “been operating in a manner consistent with [his] \nobjectives” and whom he does not trust to “fairly evaluate matters” or to “faithfully \nexecute” federal labor law.  Wilcox Compl. Ex. A at 2-3.3  \n \n3  Wilcox additionally notes (Opp. 25) that the government has not yet sought \na stay in Grundmann v. Trump, No. 25-cv-425, 2025 WL 782665 (D.D.C. Mar. 12, \n2025), a case where a district court blocked the President’s removal of a member of \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority.  But when the district court issued that order, \nthe government’s stay motions in these cases were already pending before the D.C. \nCircuit.  See Gov’t Wilcox C.A. Stay Mot. (Mar. 10, 2025); Gov’t Harris C.A. Stay Mot. \n(Mar. 6, 2025).  The government reasonably decided to wait for decisions in these \ncases before seeking relief in Grundmann. \n \n\n15 \n  2.  Respondents identify no competing equities that justify denying a stay.  \nThey assert an interest in “resuming [their] work,” Wilcox Opp. 26, and “performing \n[their] duties,” Harris Opp. 36.  Article II, however, vests the executive power in the \nPresident, not in respondents.  NLRB and MSPB members, like other executive offic-\ners, “ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate.”  The \nFederalist No. 72, at 487 (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961) (Alexander Hamilton).  They \nwield the President’s power on the President’s behalf.  They have no personal interest \nin wielding executive power at all, and they certainly have no legitimate interest in \ncontinuing to wield that power over the President’s objection.  See Appl. 35-36. \nRespondents also observe (Wilcox Opp. 1; Harris Opp. 5) that their removals \nwould leave the NLRB and MSPB without quorums.  But it is for the President, not \nthe courts, to decide whether it is better to deprive those agencies of quorums than to \ncontinue entrusting executive power to respondents.  The creation of quorums to take \nactions that the President opposes is itself an irreparable harm to the government.  \nIf this Court ultimately sides with the government, moreover, those quorums might \nbe retroactively vitiated, and courts or the agencies themselves might have to undo \nthe actions taken during this litigation by agency heads who were wrongfully rein-\nstated and could not exercise executive power.  See Appl. 35; Coalition for a Demo-\ncratic Workplace Amicus Br. 21-25. \nD.  This Court Should Grant Certiorari Before Judgment \n1.  Observing that this Court recently denied certiorari in two recent cases \nconcerning the constitutionality of tenure protections for members of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission, respondents argue (Wilcox Opp. 20 n.6; Harris Opp. 2 \nn.1) that the questions presented are not certworthy.  See Leachco, Inc. v. CPSC, No. \n24-156, 2025 WL 76435 (Jan. 13, 2025); Consumers’ Research v. CPSC, 145 S. Ct. 414 \n \n\n16 \n(2024) (No. 23-1323).  But the argument for certiorari in Wilcox and Harris, which \ninvolve direct challenges to removals, is far stronger than in Leachco and Consumers’ \nResearch, which involved claims that removal restrictions rendered other agency ac-\ntions unlawful.  Leachco arose in a preliminary-injunction posture; the court of ap-\npeals affirmed the denial of preliminary relief for lack of irreparable harm and dis-\ncussed the merits only briefly.  See Br. in Opp. at 7-8, Leachco, supra (No. 24-156).  \nThe government argued that Leachco “would not be an appropriate vehicle in which \nto take up” the constitutional question.  Id. at 7.  In Consumers’ Research, meanwhile, \nprivate parties contested the agency’s processing of Freedom of Information Act re-\nquests on the ground that Congress had restricted the President’s power to remove \nthe agency’s members.  See Br. in Opp. at 2, Consumers’ Research, supra (No. 23-\n1323).  The government questioned the parties’ standing and argued that their \n“highly artificial suit” was an “exceptionally poor vehicle for deciding a constitutional \nquestion of this magnitude.”  Id. at 10.   \nIn this case, by contrast, the President has removed respondents from the \nNLRB and MSPB, and respondents have sued the President to contest their removal.  \nThe questions presented have become more important and more urgent now that the \nPresident has exercised his removal power.  And these cases do not involve any of the \nvehicle problems that plagued Leachco and Consumers’ Research.  These cases plainly \nwarrant this Court’s review.  \n2.  Respondents additionally argue that “there is no emergency warranting \ncertiorari before judgment,” Wilcox Opp. 33, and that “there is no need for this Court \nto hear this case on a rushed timetable,” Harris Opp. 39.  But after the D.C. Circuit \nmotions panel granted the government a stay, Wilcox told the en banc court that its \nintervention was “urgently necessary,” that “the practical consequences of delay are \n \n\n17 \nsevere and immediate,” and that “[t]o allow multiple federal agencies to persist in \nthis state of uncertainty  * * *  is unsustainable.”  Wilcox C.A. En Banc. Pet. 1-2.  \nHarris similarly argued the en banc court’s “intervention [wa]s urgently needed,” that \nthere was a “pressing need” for “immediate guidance,” and that only an “authorita-\ntive” decision “can quell the uncertainty.”  Harris C.A. En Banc Pet. 1, 3, 18.  The \nlower courts, too, recognized the importance of resolving this case promptly; the dis-\ntrict court entered final judgment in each case just one day after the hearing, and the \ncourt of appeals set highly expedited briefing schedule.  See Appl. 27-28; see also \nAppl. App. 5a (Henderson, J., dissenting) (“Only the Supreme Court can decide the \ndispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better.”).  \nDenying certiorari before judgment could significantly delay the eventual res-\nolution of this dispute.  Most notably, if the D.C. Circuit merits panel rules in the \ngovernment’s favor, the full court will likely again rehear the case en banc.  Even \nwithout en banc review, it might take months for the D.C. Circuit to issue a decision, \nfor the losing party to file a petition for a writ of certiorari, and for this Court to \nconsider and grant that petition.  By contrast, if this Court grants certiorari before \njudgment, it could resolve the questions presented far more promptly, including after \nhearing argument in a special siting in May or September.  See Citizens United v. \nFEC,  558  U.S.  310  (2010)  (reargued  September  2009;  decided  January  2010); \nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2003) (argued September 2003; decided December \n2003); Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586 (2006) (reargued May 2006; decided June \n2006); Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997) (argued May 1997; decided June 1997). \n \n\n18 \n*  *  *  *  * \nIn both Wilcox and Harris, this Court should stay the judgment of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia pending the resolution of the government’s \nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and pending any proceedings \nin this Court.  The Court should also construe this application as a petition for a writ \nof certiorari before judgment and grant the petition.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nD. JOHN SAUER \n   Solicitor General  \nAPRIL 2025    \n ",

Harris \nafter concluding that President Donald J. Trump had unlawfully attempted to remove her from \nher position as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.  See Order Granting Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 39.  In its accompanying memorandum opinion, the \nCourt reasoned that this action violated a federal statute, and that the statute is constitutional \nunder Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935).  See generally Memorandum \nOpinion Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 40.  The Court \nadditionally granted declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction.  See id.  Defendants now \nmove to stay the order pending appeal.  See Defs.’ Mot. to Stay Order Pending Appeal, ECF No. \n42. \n“[T]he factors regulating the issuance of a stay” include “(1) whether the stay applicant \nhas made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant \nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 45     Filed 03/05/25     Page 2 of 2\nthe other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Hilton v. \nBraunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987).  As the Court discussed in its memorandum opinion, it is \nblackletter law that Congress may enact for-cause removal protections for members of a \ntraditional independent agency headed by a multimember board or commission.  See Mem. Op. \nat 7–16.  Defendants thus establish no likelihood of success on the merits.  Defendants do not \nestablish any irreparable harm to the Government, particularly given that Defendants trace this \nharm to the inability to deploy a removal power the President does not have.  See id. at 31–32.  \nDefendants furthermore do not argue that Harris has been ineffective in her position or has \notherwise impeded the business of the MSPB.  See id.  To the contrary, staying the Court’s order \nwill injure Harris in her personal capacity and her official capacity as a member of the MSPB, \nand the Court has already found this harm to be irreparable.  See id. at 28–30.  Staying the \nCourt’s order is not in the public interest, particularly given that the Court simply orders \nDefendants to comply with clear and controlling federal law.  The Court thus finds a stay \nunwarranted. \nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Stay \nOrder Pending Appeal (ECF No. 42) is DENIED. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  March 5, 2025  RUDOLPH CONTRERAS \n  United States District Judge \n2 \n ",

HARRIS, in her personal capacity   \nand in her official capacity as Member of the   \nMerit Systems Protection Board,   \n       Civil Case No. 1:25-cv-00412-RC \nPlaintiff,   \n    \n-against-   \n   \nSCOTT BESSENT, in his official capacity as  ORAL ARGUMENT \nSecretary of the Treasury, et al.,  RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nOpposition To Defendants’ Motion to Stay Temporary Restraining Order \n \n  In opposing Plaintiff’s request for a temporary restraining order, the Government asks this \nCourt to ignore landmark, century-old Supreme Court precedent for the thinnest of reasons.  Defs’ \nTRO Opp. 8 n.1 (acknowledging that “Humphrey’s Executor is binding on this Court”).  Now the \nGovernment has taken the extraordinary step of asking this Court for a stay of its emergency relief. \n  This Court should reject that request.  It is hornbook law that a litigant cannot appeal a \ntemporary restraining order, and earlier this week a panel of the D.C. Circuit confirmed that the \nCourt of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over a similar appeal to a temporary restraining order in the \ncase involving the purported removal of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger.  See Dellinger v. \nBessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir, Feb. 15, 2024).  Indeed, the whole purpose of the temporary \nrestraining order is to preserve the status quo for a few days while the parties can brief the case \nand produce an appealable order for appellate review.   \nThis  is  no  meaningful  justification  for  this  appellate  fire  drill—except,  perhaps, \nDefendants’ thin hope of a different result this time in the Court of Appeals.  This Court has already \nestablished an extremely expedited briefing schedule in which Plaintiff’s brief is due this Sunday, \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 17     Filed 02/20/25     Page 2 of 3\nFebruary 23, 2025, and Plaintiff has agreed to consolidate the preliminary injunction with a merits \nhearing under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).  The merits of this case are crystal clear, \nindeed perhaps even stronger than in Dellinger because Plaintiff Harris serves as a member of “a \ntraditional independent agency” “run by a multimember board.”  Seila L. LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n197, 206 (2020); see TRO Op.  9 (“This case appears to be on all fours with Humphrey’s \nExecutor.”).  Meanwhile, the Government with no sense of irony declines to engage with this \nCourt’s opinion, accuses this Court of ignoring precedent, and argues that this Court’s order to \npreserve the status quo threatens “our democratic system.”  TRO Op. 2.  This Court should apply \nsettled law and deny the motion. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Defendant’s motion to stay the Temporary \nRestraining Order pending appeal. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Jeremy D.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris was appointed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) \non June 1, 2022, to a term set to expire on March 1, 2028.  Federal law states that members of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board may be removed from office “only for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.”  On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump informed \nHarris that her position on the MSPB was “terminated, effective immediately” but provided no \nreason for Harris’s termination.  The following day, Harris filed this lawsuit against President \nTrump and several other federal officials (“Defendants”), claiming that her termination violated \nfederal law.  She moves for a temporary restraining order declaring her removal from office to be \nunlawful, declaring that she remains a member of the MSPB, and enjoining Defendants from \ntreating her as having been removed.  For the following reasons, the Court grants that motion \nwhile the parties fully brief a motion for a preliminary injunction. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 2 of 21\nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \nCongress created the Merit Systems Protection Board as a component of the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978, which “establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions taken \nagainst federal employees.”  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 44 (2012); see also Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978 (“CSRA”), Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121–25 (1978) \n(codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 1201–05).  Congress’s Findings and Statement of Purpose indicate that \n“[i]t is the policy of the United States that . . . to provide the people of the United States with a \ncompetent, honest, and productive Federal work force[,] . . . Federal personnel management \nshould be implemented consistent with merit system principles.”  CSRA § 3, 92 Stat. at 1112.  \nThose merit system principles include, among others, “[r]ecruitment . . . from qualified \nindividuals” where “selection and advancement [is] determined solely on the basis of relative \nability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive \nequal opportunity.”  Id. § 101, 92 Stat. at 1113 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301).  Congress \nadditionally instructed that “[e]mployees should be . . . protected against arbitrary action, \npersonal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes,” as well as “against reprisal for \nthe lawful disclosure of information which the employees reasonably believe evidences,” among \nother things, violations of law, gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or substantial and \nspecific dangers to public health or safety.  Id. \nThe CSRA established the MSPB as “an independent agency consisting of three \nmembers” and “charged [it] with protecting the merit system principles and adjudicating \nconflicts between federal workers and their employing agencies.”  Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. \nBd., 672 F.2d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see also CSRA § 101, 92 Stat. at 1114–17 (codified at 5 \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 3 of 21\nU.S.C. § 2302) (establishing prohibited personnel practices, such as employment discrimination, \nunlawful political activities, and any other violations of law within the federal civil service).  The \nBoard reviews federal employee appeals of adverse actions “which [are] appealable to the Board \nunder any law, rule, or regulation,” including those related to removal or suspension for periods \ngreater than fourteen days.  5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); see also id. § 1204(a)(1).  It may order federal \nagencies and employees to comply with its decisions and conduct studies “relating to the civil \nservice” for the President and Congress.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2), (a)(3).  The MSPB also reviews \n“rules and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management.”  Id. § 1204(a)(4).  The MSPB’s \nfinal decisions are generally subject to judicial review.  See id. § 7703. \nMembers of the MSPB are “appointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate,” and “not more than 2 of [the members] may be adherents of the same \npolitical party.”  CSRA § 202 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1201).  Members of the MSPB are \nappointed to seven-year terms that may be extended by up to one year if a successor has not yet \nbeen appointed.  Id. (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1202(a)–(c)).  “Any member may be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. (codified at 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202(d)). \nB.  Factual Background \nPresident Joseph R. Biden initially nominated Harris to be a member of the MSPB on \nJune 24, 2021, and renominated her on January 4, 2022.  Compl. ¶ 24, ECF No. 1.  The Senate \nconfirmed Harris on May 25, 2022, and she was sworn in on June 1, 2022.  Id.  Her term expires \non March 1, 2028.  Id.

A to Compl., ECF No. 1-1; see also Ex. A to Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 2-2.  The \ncommunication does not explain the basis for Harris’s termination. \n  Harris filed this lawsuit on February 11, 2025, claiming that her firing was ultra vires, \nunconstitutional, and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  See Compl. ¶¶ 31–37, 40–\n41.  She seeks relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, issuance of a writ of mandamus, and \nequitable relief.  See id. ¶¶ 38–39, 42–46.  Harris additionally filed a motion for a temporary \nrestraining order, see Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 2, which Defendants oppose, see Defs.’ \nOpp’n to Mot. for TRO (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 6.  On February 13, 2025, the Court held a \nhearing on the TRO motion. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n“The purpose of a temporary restraining order is to preserve the status quo for a limited \nperiod of time until the Court has the opportunity to pass on the merits of the demand for a \npreliminary injunction.”  Barrow v. Graham, 124 F. Supp. 2d 714, 715–16 (D.D.C. 2000) (citing \nWarner Bros. Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc., 877 F.2d 1120, 1125 (2d Cir. 1989)).  “An \napplication for a TRO is analyzed using the same factors applicable to a request for preliminary \ninjunctive relief.”  Scottsdale Cap. Advisors Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., Inc., 678 F. Supp. \n3d 88, 99 (D.D.C. 2023) (citing Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 723–24 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).   \n“A preliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the [movant] is entitled to such relief.’”  John Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 5 of 21\nBureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  “The last two factors ‘merge when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.’”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & \nExplosives, 920 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  \n“Of course, the movant carries the burden of persua[ding]” the Court that these factors merit \npreliminary relief, Fla. EB5 Invs., LLC v. Wolf, 443 F. Supp. 3d 7, 11 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing \nCobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2004)), and must do so by making a “clear \nshowing,” Cobell, 391 F.3d at 258.  A district court must generally consider and balance each of \nthese factors in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.  See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 \nF.3d 388, 392–93 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  “A preliminary injunction may be granted based on less \nformal procedures and on less extensive evidence than in a trial on the merits.”  Cobell, 391 F.3d \nat 261.   \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nThe Court concludes that Harris has established a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits, that irreparable harm is likely to occur in the absence of injunctive relief, and that the \npublic interest weighs in favor of enjoining Defendants’ actions.  Harris has thus carried her \nburden to establish that a temporary restraining order is warranted here. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nHarris argues that she is likely to prevail on the merits of her claims based on Supreme \nCourt precedent and the nature of the MSPB’s powers.  See Mem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for TRO \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 6 of 21\n(“Pl.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 2-1.  Specifically, she argues that Humphrey’s Executor v. United States \nand its progeny confirm the constitutionality of the conditions placed on removal of MSPB \nmembers.  295 U.S. 602 (1935); see also Pl.’s Mot. at 5–6.  She additionally cites the MSPB’s \nlimited authority, quasi-legislative functions, need for independence, and accountability to \nCongress and the President as reasons for the constitutionality of members’ appointment for a \nterm of years with specific conditions for removal.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 8–10.  Defendants argue \nthat Humphrey’s Executor does not apply because the MSPB exercises executive power—it may \nissue orders to federal employees, adjudicate and take final action, and litigate on its own behalf.  \nSee Defs.’ Opp’n at 7.  The Court concludes that Harris has demonstrated a likelihood of success \non the merits. \nHumphrey’s Executor appears to dictate the outcome of this case.  The Federal Trade \nCommission (“FTC”) comprises five members “appointed by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate,” and “[n]ot more than three of the commissioners shall be \nmembers of the same political party.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619–20 (quoting 15 \nU.S.C. § 41).  “Any Commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41).  In Humphrey’s Executor, \nPresident Hoover had appointed William Humphrey as a member of the Federal Trade \nCommission, which carried a term of seven years.  295 U.S. at 612.  Less than two years later, \nPresident Roosevelt terminated Humphrey over differences of political opinion, stating, \n“[e]ffective as of this date you are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the \nFederal Trade Commission.”  Id. at 619.  Humphry died several months later, but his estate sued \nto recover backpay on the basis that his removal was unlawful.  Id. at 612. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 7 of 21\nThe Supreme Court confirmed that President Roosevelt’s termination of Humphry was \nindeed unlawful.  The Court observed that “[t]he statute fixes a term of office, in accordance \nwith many precedents.”  Id. at 623.  The Court further explained: \nThe commission is to be nonpartisan; and it must, from the very nature of its \nduties, act with entire impartiality.  It is charged with the enforcement of no \npolicy except the policy of the law.  Its duties are neither political nor executive, \nbut predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative.  Like the Interstate \nCommerce Commission, its members are called upon to exercise the trained \njudgment of a body of experts “appointed by law and informed by experience.” \nId. at 624.  The Court differentiated FTC members from the postmaster in Myers v. United \nStates, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) (evaluating statute stating that postmasters “shall hold their offices for \nfour years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law”).  “A postmaster is an \nexecutive officer restricted to the performance of executive functions” and is “charged with no \nduty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power.”  Id. at 627.  The FTC, in contrast, \n“acts in part quasi legislatively and in part quasi judicially” rather than exercising traditional \nexecutive powers.  Id. at 629.  “We think it plain under the Constitution that illimitable power of \nremoval is not possessed by the President in respect of officers of the character of those just \nnamed,” the Court concluded.  Id.   \nTwo decades later, the Court considered President Eisenhower’s removal of a member of \nthe War Claims Commission, whom President Truman had appointed and the Senate had \nconfirmed.  See Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958).  Congress charged that \ncommission with processing “claims for compensating internees, prisoners of war, and religious \norganizations . . . who suffered personal injury or property damage at the hands of the enemy in \nconnection with World War II,” and the commissioners’ terms were limited by the short duration \nof the commission’s existence.  Id.  The Court reasoned that Congress intended to “preclude[] \nthe President from influencing the Commission in passing on a particular claim,” which meant \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 8 of 21\nthat the President naturally could not “hang . . . the Damocles’ sword of removal” over the \ncommissioners.  Id. at 356.  The Court reaffirmed that the President had “no such power” to \n“remove a member of an adjudicatory body like the War Claims Commission merely because he \nwanted his own appointees on such a Commission.”  Id.1 \nThe Supreme Court recently recognized the constitutionality of this narrow restriction on \nthe President’s removal power in Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 215 (2020).  Humprey’s Executor, the Court explained, “permitted Congress to give \nfor-cause removal protections to a multimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, \nthat performed legislative and judicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive \npower.”  Id. at 216; see also Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, \n483 (2010) (summarizing Humphrey’s Executor as holding that “Congress can, under certain \ncircumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the President, \nwhom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause.”). \nThis case appears to be on all fours with Humphrey’s Executor.  The MSPB is “a \nmultimember body of experts” that is “balanced along partisan lines.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n215.  The President will therefore likely have the “opportunity to shape its leadership and thereby \n \n1 The Court once again considered a multi-member body in Mistretta v. United States \nwhen passing on the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing Commission, which \nformally resides in the Judiciary.  488 U.S. 361 (1989).  The Sentencing Report Act of 1984 \nempowered the President to appoint commissioners to the Sentencing Commission, with \nmembers “subject to removal by the President ‘only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \nor for other good cause shown.’”  Id. at 368 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 991(a)).  When considering \nwhether the Act affords the President undue influence over federal judges who served as \ncommissioners, the Court recognized that “the President’s removal power under the Act is \nlimited.”  Id. at 410.  “Such congressional limitation on the President’s removal power, like the \nremoval provisions upheld in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and Humphrey’s Executor \n. . . , is specifically crafted to prevent the President from exercising ‘coercive influence’ over \nindependent agencies.”  Id. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 9 of 21\ninfluence its activities.”  Id. at 225.  The CSRA envisions that the Board “is to be nonpartisan; \nand it must, from the very nature of its duties, act with entire impartiality.”  Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 624.  The CSRA also “fixes a term of office.”  Id. at 623.  The MSPB’s \nduties are “quasi judicial,” id. at 624, in that it conducts preliminary adjudication of federal \nemployees’ claims, which may then be appealed to the Federal Circuit.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 1204(a)(1), 7703.  Although the MSPB lacks its own rulemaking authority, Congress intended \nthe agency to aid its legislative goals by regularly transmitting reports to Congress regarding the \nBoard’s functions.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(l), 1205.  It is additionally evident that Congress hoped \nto “preclude[] the President from influencing the [Board] in passing on a particular claim.”  \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 356. \nThe MSPB additionally regulates government activity rather than that of private parties, \nlimiting the risk that its members can represent any “special threat to individual liberty.”  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 223; see also Pl.’s Mot. at 8 (emphasizing that “the MSPB does not regulate or \npenalize private activity”).  Instead, the MSPB primarily enforces merit system principles within \nthe federal government and responds to prohibited personnel practices, such as employment \ndiscrimination and retaliation against whistleblowers.  See 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b).  This authority is \nfundamentally narrower than that of the FTC, which regulates private conduct.  See 15 U.S.C. \n§ 45a–55 (defining scope of trade practices regulated by the FTC); id. § 45 (empowering FTC to \nregulate commerce); see also Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at *8 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025), aff’d, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (per curiam) (explaining \nthat the Office of Special Counsel “is not an agency endowed with the power to articulate, \nimplement, or enforce policy that affects a broad swath of the American public or its economy”).  \nThe Board also remains politically accountable to Congress and the President through the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 10 of 21\nappropriations process in a manner inapplicable to independent agencies with their own funding \nsources.  See Selia Law, 591 U.S. at 226 (discussing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s \n“receipt of funds outside the appropriations process”); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 231 \n(2021) (observing that “the [Federal Housing Finance Agency] is not funded through the \nordinary appropriations process”). \nFinally, the MSPB’s mission and purpose require independence.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 9–10.  \nIn enacting the CSRA, Congress exercised its power to regulate the civil service.  See U.S. Civ. \nServ. Comm’n v. Nat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 413 U.S. 548, 555 (1973) (“Congress \nand the President are responsible for an efficient public service.” (quoting United Pub. Workers \nof Am. (C.I.O.) v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 99 (1947))).  It defined certain prohibited personnel \npractices, to include discrimination, loyalty oaths, coercion to engage in political activity, and \nretaliation against whistleblowers.  See 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1)–(3), (8).  Direct political control \nover the MSPB would have limited effect on the President’s implementation of his policy \nagenda.  It would instead neuter the CSRA’s statutory scheme by allowing high-ranking \ngovernment officials to engage in prohibited practices and then pressure the MSPB into inaction.  \nThe MSPB’s independence is therefore structurally inseparable from the CSRA itself.2 \nBecause the MSPB falls within the scope of Humphrey’s Executor, Congress has the \npower to specify that members of the MSPB may serve for a term of years, with the President \nempowered to remove those members only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice.  The President did not indicate that any of these reasons drove his decision to terminate \n \n2 Furthermore, the MSPB’s duties dovetail with United States v. Perkins, in which the \nSupreme Court held that Congress may place some limitations on the removal of inferior \nofficers.  116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886).  Denying independence to the Board would undermine these \nconstitutionally sound limitations on the removal of civil servants. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 11 of 21\nHarris.  The Court thus concludes that Harris has demonstrated that she is likely to show her \ntermination as a member of the MSPB was unlawful.3 \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nHarris asserts that she will suffer irreparable harm because, absent interim relief, she will \nbe deprived of her “statutory right to function” as a senior government official.  Pl.’s Mot. at 10 \n(quoting Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as \nmoot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam)).  She additionally contends that the injury will \nbe irreparable because her claim to MSPB membership may be frustrated by the appointment of \na successor.  Id. at 11.  She also argues that denial of emergency relief and confusion about the \nstatus of the MSPB may “deprive Plaintiff and the MSPB of the ‘ability to fulfill [their] mandate’ \nto federal employees.”  Id. (quoting Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5).  Defendants respond that Harris \ncannot claim irreparable harm as an employee separated from her position, see Defs.’ Opp’n at \n10–11, because the MSPB continues to function with a quorum, see id. at 11–13, and because the \nPresident has not yet nominated a successor, see id. at 13.  The Court concludes that Harris has \nestablished irreparable harm in this case.   \nTo sustain injunctive relief, the threat of irreparable injury must be “likely in the absence \nof an injunction,” rather than a mere “possibility.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  The injury must be \n \n3 Defendants argue that Harris cannot show entitlement to reinstatement because she has \nbeen removed from office, and “[t]he President cannot be compelled to retain the services of a \nprincipal officer whom the President no longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise of \nexecutive power.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 10.  Defendants posit that Harris’s remedy should be limited \nto back pay.  See id.  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974), discussed further below, appears \nto cut against this conclusion, as there the Supreme Court did “not wish to be understood as \nforeclosing [injunctive] relief in the genuinely extraordinary situation.”  Id. at 92 n.68.  In \naddition, the Court’s job at this stage is to determine whether to issue a temporary restraining \norder preserving the “the regime in place” before Defendants issued the termination order while \nthese issues are fully considered.  Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733 (D.C. Cir. \n2022).   \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 12 of 21\ntruly irreparable: “[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy \nnecessarily expended in the absence of a[n injunction] are not enough.”  Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. Fed. \nEnergy Reg. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  The “the irreparable \nharm analysis . . . assumes, without deciding, that the movant has demonstrated a likelihood that \nthe non-movant’s conduct violates the law.”  Id. at 303. \nIn addition, a federal employee seeking an injunction requiring the Government to \nemploy her during the course of litigation “must make a showing of irreparable injury sufficient \nin kind and degree to override” the Government’s traditional autonomy over its internal affairs, \nwhich “cut[s] against the availability of preliminary injunctions in Government personnel cases.”  \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 84 (1974).  In Sampson, the Supreme Court considered \nwhether a probationary employee at the General Services Administration could receive a \ntemporary restraining order enjoining her dismissal during an administrative appeal to the Civil \nService Commission.  Id. at 62–63.  The Court concluded that, particularly considering the \nGovernment’s prerogative to manage its employees, the loss of wages and reputation that may be \nremedied through further proceedings fell “far short of the type of irreparable injury which is a \nnecessary predicate to the issuance of a temporary injunction in this type of case.”  Id. at 91–92.  \nThe Court nonetheless allowed that a “District Court is not totally without authority to grant \ninterim injunctive relief to a discharged Government employee,” id. at 63, and that relief may be \nappropriate “in the genuinely extraordinary situation,” rather than “in the routine case.”  Id. at 92 \nn.68.   \nHarris has established that this case represents a “genuinely extraordinary situation” \nmeriting injunctive relief for a discharged Government employee.  Unlike the probationary \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 13 of 21\nemployee in Sampson, Harris was appointed Chairman of a federal agency and confirmed by the \nSenate.4   See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 80–81.  The conditions under which the President may end \nher tenure are made plain by federal statute and supported by ninety years of Supreme Court \nprecedent.  See Dellinger, at *10 (finding Sampson’s “analysis” to be “of little utility” in case of \nemployee terminated despite for-cause removal protections).  Sampson additionally relied on \n“the well-established rule that the Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude \nin the ‘dispatch of its own internal affairs.’” Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (quoting Cafeteria & Rest. \nWorkers Union, Local 473, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 896 (1961)).  Yet that \nconcern is minimized in the context of an action that at this stage appears to be nakedly illegal, \nsuch that the Government’s range of options is necessarily constrained. \nHarris cites Berry v. Reagan, which—although vacated as moot under United States v. \nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950), see 732 F.2d 949—remains instructive here.  See \nPl.’s Mot. at 10–11.  In that case, Congress established “[t]he Commission on Civil Rights [as] a \ntemporary, bipartisan agency” to be “composed of six members, appointed by the President, by \nand with the advice and consent of the Senate.”  Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *1.  The commissioners \nwere to serve for a fixed term set to “expire[] sixty days after submission of [the Commission’s] \nfinal report and recommendations to the President and to Congress.”  Id.  Three years after their \nappointments, President Reagan notified the commissioners of their termination, and they sought \nan injunction.  Id. \n \n4 Defendants cite numerous cases in which courts have declined to issue injunctive relief \nbased on “the deprivation of a unique, singular, or high-level position.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 11.  \nNone of these cases involved plaintiffs who enjoyed removal protections enacted by Congress \nand signed into law by the President.  Courts have found injunctive relief warranted in such \nsituations.  See Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5; Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *14. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 14 of 21\nThe Berry court proceeded through analysis remarkably similar to that here.  The court \nconsidered whether the Civil Rights Act of 1957 contained a congressional intent to protect the \ncommissioners’ independence under Humphrey’s Executor.  See id. *2–4.  After concluding that \nCongress intended the commissioners to serve for the full life of the Commission, the court \nmoved on to consider irreparable harm.  See id. at *4.  The court then looked to Sampson to \ndetermine if the commissioners’ injuries “override the factors militating against the issuance of \npreliminary relief” in Government personnel actions.  Id. at *5.  The court concluded that the \ninjury was irreparable because denial of preliminary relief would have an “obviously disruptive \neffect” on “the Commission’s final activities.”  Id.  “Moreover,” the court continued, “it is not \nclear that the President has the power to remove Commissioners at his discretion and that he \nshould be given the widest latitude to exercise this authority.”  Id.  In addition, the \ncommissioners did “not have administrative, statutory, or other relief that is readily available to \nmany federal employees.”  Id.5  The court then granted the injunction.  Id. at *6. \nOne Judge in this Circuit recently issued a temporary restraining order under similar \ncircumstances.  See generally Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022.  In that case, the President terminated \nSpecial Counsel Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed to a five-year term to the independent \nOffice of Special Counsel and “may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. at *3 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 1211(b)).  The court concluded \nthat these for-cause removal conditions were likely constitutional.  Id. at *9.  Analyzing the \nirreparable harm, the court also turned to Sampson and Berry, determining that Dellinger “was \nappointed for a fixed term, and he has a statutory mission that his removal has rendered him \n \n5 The parties do not discuss what administrative relief may be available to Harris here, so \nthe Court does not consider the issue. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 15 of 21\nunable to fulfill.”  Id. at *11.  “[T]he loss of the ability to do what Congress specifically directed \nhim to do cannot be remediated with anything other than equitable relief.”  Id.   \nAt the motion hearing in this case, Defendants argued that Dellinger is incorrect in part \nbecause the court there conflated the notion of an agency’s statutory right to function with what \nthey say is “essentially an employment action.”  But Berry, Dellinger, Humphrey’s Executor, \nand Wiener together make clear that these cases represent far more than grievances over backpay \nand routine personnel issues.  Like the plaintiffs in Berry and Dellinger, Harris was appointed to \nand confirmed as a member of an agency charged with acting with a degree of independence \nfrom the President.  By vindicating their rights to occupy those offices, these plaintiffs act as \nmuch in their own interests as those of their agencies’.6  The Supreme Court in Humphrey’s \nExecutor and Wiener similarly viewed the plaintiffs before them as vindicating the independence \nof their agencies and discussed at length the nature of the President’s power over those agencies \nrather than the narrow issue of unpaid salaries.  See, e.g., Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629 \n(discussing the relative authorities of Congress and the President over independent agencies); \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 353–56 (same).  The plaintiffs in these cases are not low-ranking staff \nmembers at those agencies, either—Dellinger was appointed to lead the Office of Special \nCounsel, and Harris was appointed as one of three members of the MSPB.  Striking at the \nindependence of these officials accrues harm to their offices, as well.  See Berry, 1983 WL 538, \nat *5 (considering the effect on the federal agency of declining to issue an injunction); English v. \nTrump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 335 (D.D.C. 2018) (same). \n \n6 Indeed, Harris stands before this Court in her personal and official capacities.  See \nCompl. at 1; see also Pl.’s Reply at 4–6, ECF No. 7 (discussing harm to Harris in her official \ncapacity). \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 16 of 21\nWith this in mind, the irreparable harm in this case becomes clear.  Were the President \nable to displace independent agency heads from their positions for the length of litigation such as \nthis, those officials’ independence would shatter.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 10 (“Simply put, Congress \nreasonably concluded that the MSPB cannot serve as an independent protector of a merit system \nif the Members are subject at all times to removal without cause by the President.”); Pl.’s Reply \nat 7, ECF No. 7 (“Allowing Ms. Harris’s illegal termination to stand for even a short period \nwould violate the bipartisan, independent nature of the Board.”).  Even if this Court were to \ndirect Harris’s reinstatement after resolving the merits of her claims—a process that can take \nsome time—the MSPB’s congressionally mandated independence would be permanently marred \nby the threat of renewed removal and delayed reinstatement while litigation proceeds.  See \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629–30 (explaining that the “coercive influence” of the \nremoval power “threatens the independence of a commission”).  Harris would reenter the \nposition as a Chairman of the MSPB who had just been removed from her role for a significant \nlength of time, and “the Damocles’ sword of removal by the President,” Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356, \nwould hang over her and her colleagues.  This harm would accrue in the absence of a temporary \nrestraining order, and the passage of time would both cause this damage and preclude a remedy.  \nSee Wisc. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674 (stating that injunctive relief is appropriate when post-hoc \n“legal remedies” are “inadqeua[te]”).  If there ever were an “extraordinary case[]” meriting \ninjunctive relief for a Government employee, Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68, then this would be \nit. \nAssuming that the Defendants’ actions are unlawful, see Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches at 303, Harris additionally suffers irreparable harm because she is at present prevented \nfrom chairing the Board following Senate confirmation to that position, see Pl.’s Mot. at 10–11.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 17 of 21\nThe Berry court reasoned that “deprivation” of the plaintiff commissioners’ “statutory right to \nfunction as Commissioners” following “their unlawful removal from office by the President” \nrepresented irreparable harm.  1983 WL 538, at *5.  So too did the Special Counsel in Dellinger \nsuffer irreparable harm by the inability to fulfill his “statutory mission” to protect employees \nfrom prohibited personnel practices, such that “the loss of the ability to do what Congress \nspecifically directed him to do cannot be remediated with anything other than equitable relief.”  \nDellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *11.  MSPB members are similarly charged with protecting \nfederal employees from prohibited practices, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204, and subtracting time from \nHarris’s congressionally mandated seven-year term prevents her from carrying out the duties \nCongress has assigned to her.  \nFurthermore, Defendants contend that because Harris has been removed from office and \nseeks to return, she can suffer no injury in her capacity as a member of the MSPB.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’ at 10 (arguing that Harris “seek[s] judicial reinstatement to a principal office”); id. at 11 \n(comparing Harris’s situation to those of government employees lacking tenure protections).  \nThis puts the cart before the horse.  First, assuming that the President lacked the power to \nterminate Harris without cause, then she rightfully remains a Senate-confirmed member of the \nMSPB.  See Humphrey’s Executor at 629 (holding that the removal “power does not extend to an \noffice such as that here involved”).  Defendants thus conflate wrongful termination with the lack \nof power to effectuate termination—at least without cause.  Second, this position fails to \nrecognize that any later reinstatement of Harris would not restore the state of affairs that existed \nprior to her purported termination, given that she would not longer serve as a member of a truly \nindependent agency. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 18 of 21\nDefendants contend that Harris “cites no injury of a kind that the Supreme Court has \nrecognized as irreparable in this context.”  Def.’s Mot. at 11 (citing Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & \nn.6).  They aver that “court after court in this Circuit and others has concluded that loss of \nemployment does not constitute irreparable harm.”  Id.  Indeed, it is “well settled that economic \nloss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.”  Wisc. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.  Yet \ncourts often reach this conclusion based on the notion that a wrongfully discharged employee \nmay be entitled to back pay.  See, e.g., id. (reasoning that “adequate compensatory or other \ncorrective relief [may] be available at a later date”); Sampson, 415 U.S. at 90; Davenport v. Int’l \nBhd. of Teamsters, AFL-CIO, 166 F.3d 356, 367 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Williams v. Walsh, 619 F. \nSupp. 3d 48, 63–64 (D.D.C. 2022).  That is not the issue in this case.  Harris does not seek \ncompensatory damages, but rather complains of injury arising from her inability to occupy a \nposition at an independent agency following her presidential appointment and Senate \nconfirmation.   \nDefendants additionally cite English v. Trump for the notion that “‘any such harm’ to \nPlaintiff coming solely from her not functioning as a Member of the MSPB ‘can be remediated \nin the ordinary course of this case.’”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 12 (quoting English, 279 F. Supp. at 335).  \nIn English, the CFPB Director resigned, he appointed his Deputy to take his place, and an \napparent conflict arose between two statutes governing succession at the agency.  English, 279 F. \nSupp. at 319.  One provision of the Dodd-Frank Act stated that the CFPB Deputy Director would \n“serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the Director.”  Id. (quoting 12 U.S.C. \n§ 5491(b)(5)(B)).  The Federal Vacancy Reform Act (“FVRA”), however, also grants the \nPresident the power to appoint acting officers either from within a federal agency or from a \ndifferent agency if the official is Senate-confirmed.  See id. at 312.  The English court \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 19 of 21\ndetermined that the two statutes could be read to avoid a conflict, such that the Dodd-Frank Act \nprovided a default rule that the President may override under the FVRA.  Id. at 319.  Even \nassuming that the Deputy Director were likely to prevail, however, the court found no irreparable \nharm because CFPB would continue to operate, and the Deputy Director never functioned as the \nCFPB’s acting director.  See id. at 334 (distinguishing Berry).   \nEnglish does not guide the outcome here for at least three reasons.  First, Harris was duly \nappointed to her position at the MSPB.  In contrast, the Deputy Director in English was not \nSenate-confirmed to carry out specific duties and never occupied the position of acting Director.  \nSee id. at 335; see also Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *12.  The Deputy Director was instead \ndenied the opportunity to fill a role in the context of a statutory conflict between the Dodd-Frank \nAct and the FVRA, and she was not attempting to preserve the status quo.  See English, 279 F. \nSupp. at 335; see also Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *12.  Second, Harris was terminated from \nher Senate-confirmed position without cause, while the Deputy Director was not fired from any \nposition, much less one from which she could be removed solely for cause.  See English, 279 F. \nSupp. at 313–15.  Finally, Harris’s termination from the MSPB has foreclosed her ability to carry \nout the agency’s mission, whereas the Deputy Director remained in place at the CFPB.  See id. at \n334.7 \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Harris has demonstrated a likelihood that \nshe will experience irreparable harm that cannot be remedied by her reinstatement once the \nmerits have been decided.8 \n \n7 The parties additionally appeal to Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144 (D.D.C.), to \nsupport their respective positions.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11; Defs.’ Opp’n at 12–13.  Mackie is \ninapplicable here for the reasons articulated in Dellinger.  See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, *11 \nn.6. \n8 The Court does not, at present, find the threat of Harris’s replacement to represent \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 20 of 21\nC.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \nHarris argues that the balance of the equities and public interest weigh in her favor \nbecause the Government’s recent flurry of personnel actions has led to uncertainty that requires \nstability at the MSPB.  Pl.’s Mot. at 12.  Defendants respond that the public interest counsels \nagainst injunctive relief, which would “intru[de] into the President’s authority to exercise ‘all of’ \nthe ‘executive Power’ of the United States.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13–14. \nGiven that federal law limits the conditions under which Harris’s tenure may be \nterminated, Supreme Court precedent supports the constitutionality of those conditions, and \nDefendants do not argue that those conditions were met here, the Court finds that it is in the \npublic interest to issue injunctive relief.  “[T]here is a substantial public interest ‘in having \ngovernmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.’”  \nLeague of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting \nWashington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).  So too is there substantial public \ninterest in the protections from removal Congress has given to certain members of independent \nagencies.  Furthermore, the government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends \nan unlawful practice or reads a statute as required.”  R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 \n(D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013)). \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris’s Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder is GRANTED; and it is  \n \nirreparable injury, as she does not establish that the President is “likely” to nominate a \nreplacement “in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis omitted); see \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 13 (citing English, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 335). \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 9     Filed 02/18/25     Page 21 of 21\nFURTHER ORDERED that from the date of entry of this Court’s Order until the Court \nrules on a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris shall continue to serve as Chairman \nof the MSPB.  Defendants Secretary Scott Bessent, Deputy Director Trent Morse, Director \nSergio Gor, Acting Chairman Henry Kerner, and Director Russell Vought are ENJOINED from \nremoving Harris from her office or in any way treating her as having been removed, denying or \nobstructing Harris’s access to any of the benefits or resources of her office, placing a \nreplacement in Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other person as a member of the \nMSPB in Harris’s position, pending further order of the Court; and it is  \nFURTHER ORDERED that Harris shall file any motion for a preliminary injunction on \nor before February 23, 2025.

HARRIS, in her personal capacity  : \nand in her official capacity as Member of the  : \nMerit Systems Protection Board,  : \n    : \n  Plaintiff,  :  Civil Action No.:  25-412 (RC) \n    : \n  v.  :  Re Document No.:  16 \n    : \nSCOTT BESSENT, in his official capacity as  : \nSecretary of the Treasury, et al.,  : \n    : \n  Defendants.  : \nORDER \nDENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \nOn February 18, 2025, this Court issued a temporary restraining order requiring \nDefendants to reinstate Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris as Chairman of the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard.  See Order Granting Mot. for Temporary Restraining Order, ECF No. 8.  In its \naccompanying memorandum opinion, the Court reasoned that Harris was likely to show both that \nher termination violated a federal statute, and that the statute was constitutional under \nHumphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935).  See generally Mem. Op. Granting \nMot. for Temporary Restraining Order (“Mem. Op.”), ECF No. 9.  The Court additionally \nreasoned that Harris would suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and that the equities \nand public interest weighed in favor of a temporary restraining order.  See id.  Defendants now \nmove to stay the temporary restraining order.  See Defs.’ Mot. to Stay Temporary Restraining \nOrder (“Defs.’ Mot.”), ECF No. 16. \n“[T]he factors regulating the issuance of a stay” include “(1) whether the stay applicant \nhas made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 18     Filed 02/20/25     Page 2 of 2\nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure \nthe other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Hilton v. \nBraunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987).  As the Court discussed in its memorandum opinion, \nHarris—not Defendants—has shown a likelihood of success on the merits.  See Mem. Op. at 5–\n11.  Defendants do not establish irreparable harm flowing from the Government’s requirement to \nfollow the law, particularly one supported by at least ninety years of Supreme Court precedent.  \nSee Defs.’ Mot. at 2 (arguing that the President’s inability to appoint a replacement constitutes \nirreparable harm).  The Court has likewise explained that the public interest and balance of the \nequities weigh in favor of injunctive relief when the Government is asked to abide by federal \nlaw.  See Mem. Op. at 20.  Staying the temporary restraining order would additionally \n“substantially injure” Harris for the reasons the Court explained in its memorandum opinion.  \nHilton, 481 U.S. at 776; see also Mem. Op. at 11–19.  The Court thus finds a stay unwarranted \nhere, particularly given the parties’ compressed schedule for briefing on the merits of Harris’s \nclaims.  See Joint Status Report, ECF No. 13 (stating parties’ agreement to consolidate \npreliminary injunction with the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)). \nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Stay \nTemporary Restraining Order (ECF No. 16) is DENIED. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  February 20, 2025  RUDOLPH CONTRERAS \n  United States District Judge \n2 \n ",

United States, 564 U.S. 211, 221 (2011).  And “[t]he declared \npurpose of separating and dividing the powers of government, of course, was to ‘diffus[e] power \nthe better to secure liberty.’”  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986) (quoting Youngstown \nSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)).  Allowing \nCongress to thwart presidential supervision of high-level Executive Branch officers presents an \nespecially grave danger to the States and their citizens by vesting executive power in those lacking \nthe political accountability and responsiveness Article II contemplates.   \n  Tennessee  and  other  States  have  already  suffered  harm  at  the  hands  of  putatively \nindependent Executive Branch officials.  In at least one case, Tennessee is caught between a live \ndispute between President Trump—who has ordered an executive agency enforcement document \nrescinded—and  Executive  Branch  officials  who  claim  power  to  buck  direct  presidential \ninstructions.  See Pls.’ Resp. to Notice of Executive Order and Unopposed Mot. to Vacate Hr’g, \nTennessee v. EEOC, No. 3:24-cv-224-CEA-DCP (E.D. Tenn. Jan. 22, 2025).  Tennessee thus has \nan  interest  in  pushing  against  positions  that  further  enable  a  “headless  fourth  branch  of \ngovernment” to pursue executive actions no democratically elected actor has endorsed.  City of \nArlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 314 (2013) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (citation omitted).  \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 7 of 18\nINTRODUCTION \nArticle II vests the “executive Power” in a single, nationally elected president able to act \nwith “energy” and “dispatch.”  The Federalist No. 70, at 424 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton \nRossiter ed., 1961).  Part and parcel of the President’s law-execution duty is the power to supervise \nthose carrying out Article II’s chain-of-command.  When Congress restricts the President’s ability \nto dismiss agency heads, it thwarts the vesting of “executive Power” in the President alone.   \nYet for some time now, the 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor has carved out an \naberrant exception from the constitutional rule of presidential supervision.  Whatever Humphrey’s \nreasoning used to be worth, subsequent Supreme Court cases have repudiated it.  Instead, the \nrequirement  of  at-will  removal  applies  “whenever  an  agency  does  important  work”  of  the \nExecutive Branch, regardless of its “size or role.”  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 252 (2021) \n(emphasis added).  That describes the Board to a T:  It claims power to regulate “Federal personnel \nmanagement” including “Federal agenc[ies]” and “employee[s].”  D.E. 1 ¶ 18.  So whether because \nHumphrey’s is wrong or just inapplicable, the Board’s for-cause removal restrictions violate \nArticle II.  Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary and permanent relief thus should fail.   \nPlaintiff’s counters back her into a second constitutional corner.  As several have noted, \nthe Board’s removal insulation creates an independent problem under Free Enterprise Fund’s rule \nagainst  “two  layers  of  for-cause  protection,”  since  the  Board  in  turn  may  remove  certain \nAdministrative Law Judges (ALJs) only for cause.  Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 463 (5th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477 (2010)), aff’d on \nother grounds, 603 U.S. 109.  So at the very least, either the Board’s or ALJs’ removal restrictions \ncannot stand.  Given Board members’ role as principal officers, and their Board’s adjudicatory \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 8 of 18\nduties, their restrictions are invalid under Plaintiff’s favored cases and in light of the Board’s status \nas a more modern innovation in the Executive Branch.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Article II’s vesting of the “executive Power” in a single, elected president requires \nplenary supervision of subordinate executive officials.  \nA.  The Framers’ genius lies in their choice to separate the legislative, executive, and \njudicial powers and vest each in its own branch.  The legislative power “prescribes the rules” of \nthe community. The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961).  \nThe executive power is the “sword of the community.”  Id.  And the judicial power, “declare[s] \nthe sense of the law.” Id. at 469.  The Framers “viewed the principle of separation of” those powers \nas “the absolutely central guarantee of a just Government.”  Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 697 \n(1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).   \nWith that principle in mind, the Framers proposed, and “the People of the United States …  \nordain[ed] and establish[ed],” the U.S. Constitution’s separation-of-powers framework.  U.S. \nConst. pmbl.  Article I vests “legislative Powers” in “a Congress of the United States.”  U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 1.  Article III vests the “[t]he judicial Power” in “one supreme Court, and in such inferior \nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 1.  And \nfinally, Article II: “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States.”  U.S. \nConst. art. II, § 1.   \nThe Framers understood that “[e]nergy in the executive is a leading character in the \ndefinition of good government,” while a “feeble executive” leads to “bad government.”  The \nFederalist No. 70, at 423 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961).  To satisfy the \n“necessity of an energetic executive,” Article II blends “ingredients which constitute energy in the \nexecutive,”  namely,  “unity;  duration;  an  adequate  provision  for  its  support;  and  competent \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 9 of 18\npowers.”  Id. at 423-24.  And the Constitution commands the President to “take Care that the Laws \nbe faithfully executed” to promote accountability for executive action.  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.  \nB.  While the executive power is vested in “a President,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, as a \npractical matter “the President alone and unaided could not execute the laws.”  Myers v. United \nStates, 272 U.S. 52, 117 (1926).  So the Constitution contemplates that the President will enjoy \n“the assistance of subordinates” selected through required appointment processes.  Id.  Such \nsubordinate officials include the heads of administrative agencies, which, having no superior other \nthan the President, are principal officers.  See United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021).    \nThe history of the executive power, the text  of  Article  II, and the structure of the \nConstitution dictate the President’s power to remove executive agency heads.  To start, agencies \nexercise executive power.  That follows from a process of elimination.  Agencies cannot exercise \nlegislative powers because those powers are vested in Congress, U.S. Const. art. I, § 1, and \nCongress may not delegate those powers, Whitman v. Am. Trucking Assocs., 531 U.S. 457, 472 \n(2001).  Agencies cannot exercise judicial power because they are not the Supreme Court or \ninferior courts.  Compare, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (establishing the National Labor Relations \nBoard “as an agency of the United States”) with, e.g., 26 Stat. 826-30 (1891) (establishing “circuit \ncourts  of  appeals”).    Therefore,  agency  “activities”  are  “exercises  of—indeed,  under  our \nconstitutional structure they must be exercises of—the ‘executive Power.’”  City of Arlington, 569 \nU.S. at 304 n.4 (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, § 1).  So agencies exercise executive power when they \n“issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, and \ndetermine what penalties to impose on private parties.”  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, \n225 (2020) \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 10 of 18\n   For centuries of Anglo-American legal history, the executive power has included plenary \nauthority to remove subordinate executive officials.  See generally VHS Acquisition Subsidiary \nNo. 7 v. NLRB, No. 1:24-cv-02577, 2024 WL 5056358, at *3-4 (D.D.C. Dec. 10, 2024) (collecting \nhistorical examples).  Henry of Bracton, writing in 13th century England, noted that the king \nwielded “the sword” of the community.   2 Henry de Bracton, On the Laws and Customs of England \n32 (Samuel E. Thorne trans., 1977), https://tinyurl.com/yc2xa8sy; cf. The Federalist No. 78, at \n465 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (“The executive … holds the sword of the \ncommunity.”).  While “powerful persons” were a part of “the sword” and helped the “defence of \nthe realm and the country,” they were “under the king,” and they could neither “question” nor \n“contravene” his “acts.”  Id. at 32-33.  The English king’s power over subordinates continued up \nto the American founding: “The king had the prerogative power to remove” executive officers “at \nwill.”  Michael W. McConnell, The President Who Would Not Be King 162 (2020).   \nThat English tradition carried into the United States.  During the much-discussed Decision \nof 1789, the First Congress concluded the President enjoys a “preexisting removal power.” \nSaikrishna Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91 Cornell L. Rev. 1021, 1026 (2006); see \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 492.  And that power was not academic for the Founders, as \nPresident  George  Washington  “plainly  and  willingly  employed”  the  “removal  power”  to \n“administer the executive branch … in an orderly fashion.”  Steven G. Calabresi & Christopher S. \nYoo, The Unitary Executive 42 (2008).   \nHistorical practice surrounding presidential removal power aligns with Article II’s plain \nlanguage, which guarantees the “President’s power to remove—and thus supervise—those who \nwield executive power on his behalf.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204; see also Trump v. United States, \n603 U.S. 593, 620 (2024) (“[T]he Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 11 of 18\nPresident.”).  And plenary removal also addresses functional concerns.  After all, Executive Branch \nsubordinates “act for [the President] under his direction in the execution of the laws.”  Myers, 272 \nU.S. at 117.  By “implication,” the President’s “power of removing” his subordinates “is essential \nto the execution of the laws.”  Id.  Otherwise, swaths of critical enforcement authority would \noperate insulated from “a clear and effective chain of command” headed by the President, on whom \nthe public can “pass judgment.”  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 498.     \nSurveying all this, the Supreme Court in Myers held that Article II “grants to the President” \nthe power of “removal of executive officers.”  272 U.S. at 163-64.  Myers’s approximately six-\ndozen pages of analysis included “an exhaustive examination of the First Congress’s determination \nin 1789, the views of the Framers and their contemporaries, historical practice, and [Supreme \nCourt] precedents up until that point.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 214.  Writing for the Court, Chief \nJustice Taft reinforced the President’s removal power as a pillar in our constitutional framework—\nto  impede  that  power  “might  make  impossible  that  unity  and  co-ordination  in  executive \nadministration essential to effective action.”  Myers, 272 U.S. at 134.   \nII.  For-cause removal protections for the Board and like agencies violate Article II. \nMyers’s detailed analysis of the President’s power to remove executive officials soon met \nmotivated opposition in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935).  But that \ncase was wrongly decided.  And its reasoning does not extend to the Board regardless.   \nA.  Humphrey’s examined the Federal Trade Commission Act, which limited the \nPresident’s  removal  of  FTC  commissioners  to  cases  of  “inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.”  Id. at 619.   The Humphrey’s Court considered a claim for back-pay from \nthe estate of an FTC commissioner dismissed by President Franklin Roosevelt without indicating \na statutory cause for the dismissal.  Id. at 612-19.  In about a dozen pages, the Supreme Court \nupheld the FTC’s removal restrictions against a constitutional challenge.      \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 12 of 18\nThe decision in Humphrey’s—“considered by many at the time the product of an activist, \nanti-New Deal Court bent on reducing the power of President Franklin Roosevelt,” Morrison, 487 \nU.S. at 724 (Scalia, J., dissenting)—has since been read to “permit[] Congress to give for-cause \nremoval protections to a multimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines.”  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 216.  Humphrey’s did not square that holding with Article II’s Vesting or Take Care \nClauses.  Instead, it rested its reasoning on a belief that “the duties” of the commission at issue \nwere “neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative.”  \nHumphrey’s  Ex’r,  295  U.S.  at  624.    In  so  holding,  the  Court  described  the  FTC  as  “an \nadministrative body created by Congress to carry into effect legislative policies embodied in the \nstatute and in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed, and to perform other \nspecified duties as a legislative or as a judicial aid.”  Id. at 628.   \n  Humphrey’s reasoning was wrong the day it was rendered.  To “carry into effect legislative \npolicies” and “perform other specified duties” is, by definition, to execute a law.  As discussed \nabove (supra Section I.A.) government power is either legislative, executive, or judicial.  See The \nFederalist No. 78, at 465 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961).  The legislative \npower is to prescribe rules; the executive power is to effectuate those rules.  See id.  And the \nConstitution exclusively vests each of those powers in Congress and the President, respectively.  \nFor the Court to state that the FTC’s “duties” were not “executive” was to contradict our \nconstitutional design.  Executive agency officials wield the executive power, even when doing \nthings that look like legislating and adjudicating.  See City of Arlington, 569 U.S. at 304 n.4.   \nGiven its flaws, it is no surprise that subsequent cases have narrowed Humphrey’s nearly \nout of existence: \n•  Free Enterprise Fund exhaustively detailed Article II’s design to permit agencies to be \n“fully accountable” to the President for their conduct.  Applying that rule, the Court \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 13 of 18\nheld  that  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board’s  “dual  for-cause \nlimitations on the removal of Board members contravene the Constitution’s separation \nof powers.”  561 U.S. at 492.       \n \n•  City of Arlington acknowledged that all agency activities are exercises of the executive \npower—contra Humphrey’s quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial conception of FTC.  569 \nU.S. at 304 n.4.   \n \n•  Seila Law cabined Humphrey’s Executor to allowing “for-cause removal protections to \na  multimember  body  of  experts,  balanced  along  partisan  lines,  that  performed \nlegislative and judicial functions and [are] said not to exercise any executive power.”  \n591  U.S.  at  216.    Seila  Law  noted  that,  even  under  Humphrey’s  Executor,  a \nmultimember agency that “wield[s] substantial executive power” violates Article II.  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.     \n \n•   In Collins v. Yellen, the Court held that the “Recovery Act’s for-cause restriction on \nthe President’s removal authority violates the separation of powers.”  594 U.S. at 250.  \nThe Recovery Act created the Federal Housing Finance Agency, “led by a single \nDirector” removable “by the President ‘for cause.’”  Id. at 229 (citation omitted).  The \n“FHFA clearly exercises executive power,” so even “‘modest restrictions’ on the \nPresident’s power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer” violates \nthe Constitution.  Id. at 254, 256 (citation omitted).  And that rule of at-will removal \napplies “whenever an agency does important work.”  Id. at 252. \n \nMost recently, in last term’s Trump v. United States decision, the Court noted that the \n“removal”  of  certain  federal  officers  “implicates  ‘conclusive  and  preclusive’  Presidential \nauthority.”  603 U.S. at 620-21.  A President’s exclusive power that “stem[s] … from the \nConstitution itself” is “conclusive and preclusive.”  See id. at 607 (quoting Youngstown Sheet & \nTube Co., 343 U.S. at 585; id. at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring)).  That includes “the President’s \n‘unrestricted power of removal’ with respect to ‘executive officers of the United States whom he \nhas appointed.’”  Id. at 609 (quoting Myers, 272 U.S. at 106).  “Congress cannot act on, and courts \ncannot  examine,  the  President’s  actions  on  subjects  within  his  ‘conclusive  and  preclusive’ \nconstitutional authority.”  Id. at 609.  Therefore, Trump determined that Congress cannot regulate \na President’s removal of those officers by way of criminal sanction.  Id. at 621. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 14 of 18\nPutting all this together, the Supreme Court’s recent instruction leaves at most a 1930s-\nFTC-specific exception to the general rule of at-will presidential removal.  For those modern-day \nagencies  exercising  executive  power,  Article  II  prohibits  statutes  that  purport  to  limit  the \nPresident’s ability to dismiss an agency head.  See, e.g., Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 464 n.19 (discussing \nthe interaction between City of Arlington and Seila Law).  \nB.  The Board is “composed of 3 members appointed by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, not more than 2 of whom may be adherents of the same political \nparty.”   5 U.S.C. § 1201.  If the Board exercises significant executive authority, then the \nConstitution requires its heads to be removable by the President at will.   \nThere can be no serious debate that the Board exercises “quintessentially executive power.”  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 219; see also Collins, 594 U.S. at 252-53.  The Board “adjudicate[s] … all \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the Board,” “order[s] any Federal agency or employee to comply \nwith” its orders and decisions, and “enforce[s] compliance with” those orders and decisions.  5 \nU.S.C. § 1204(a)(1), (2).  And it may “designate[]” attorneys to “appear for the Board” in “civil \naction[s]” to enforce its orders and decisions.  Id. § 1204(i).  Finally, it may “prescribe such \nregulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions.”  Id. § 1204(h).   \nYet despite those immense executive powers, the Board’s governing statute provides that \n“[a]ny member may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance  in  office.”    Id.  §  1202(d).    The  Board’s  removal  restrictions  are  plainly \nunconstitutional under Seila Law and Collins.  So Article II empowered President Trump to \nterminate Plaintiff Harris without cause or recourse in the form she requests—i.e., a court order \nsupervising presidential personnel decisions.    \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 15 of 18\nIII.  Granting  the  Board  for-cause  protection  creates  independent  constitutional \nproblems.       \nPlaintiff’s defense of the Board’s for-cause-insulated structure only tees up an independent \nconstitutional problem other courts have recognized.  Specifically, the MSPB’s suite of powers \nincludes the exclusive authority to assess and remove many Executive Branch ALJs, who are \nthemselves “Officers of the United States.”  See Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 241 (2018).  But, \nimportantly, the Board’s removal authority is generally limited to removing ALJs “only for good \ncause established.”  5 U.S.C. § 7521(a).   \nCarrying forward the Board’s for-cause removal restrictions thus generates an independent \nconstitutional problem under Free Enterprise Fund.  That case’s Article II-based rule bars \nCongress from imposing “two levels of protection from removal for those who nonetheless \nexercise significant executive power.”  561 U.S. at 514.  But Lucia determined that ALJs are indeed \nExecutive Branch officers.  And while their functions might be “adjudicative,” as Executive \nBranch officers ALJs “cannot exercise anything but executive power.”  Fleming v. USDA, 987 \nF.3d 1093, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (Rao, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The upshot:  \nIf the Board remains for-cause-removal insulated, then two levels of removal protection (the \nPresident to the Board, and the Board to ALJs) operate to insulate ALJs from presidential \nsupervision.  That result is contrary to Free Enterprise Fund.  See id. at 1115-23; see also Jarkesy, \n34 F.4th at 463 (invalidating ALJ removal protections on this basis). \nAt a minimum, then, either the Board’s or ALJs’ for-cause removal restrictions are \nunlawful.  And when it comes to remedying that constitutional problem, Plaintiff’s arguments cut \nagainst her.  First, Plaintiff contends (at 12-13, 16-17, 25) that Congress has more leeway to \ninsulate executive adjudicators from removal than those who exercise other types of enforcement \nauthority.  That framing is suspect under modern removal precedents.  See, e.g., Seila Law, 591 \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 16 of 18\nU.S. at 216 n.2 (Humphrey’s “conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive power has not \nwithstood the test of time”); Fleming, 987 F.3d at 1120 (“ALJ adjudication is an enforcement \npower.”) (Rao, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 465 n.20 (ALJs \nare “integral pieces within the SEC's powerful enforcement apparatus”).  But even accepting it, an \nadjudicator-protective test would counsel maintaining the removal restrictions of ALJs, who \nengage exclusively in adjudications, not the removal restrictions of the Board.  After all, the Board \nindisputably exercises additional executive powers—like rulemaking and independent litigation \nof cases—that are broader than ALJs’ adjudicative duty to resolve individual legal claims.  See \nU.S. Br. 3-4, 7, 9-10; Pl.’s Mot. 12. \nSecond, Plaintiff appears to posit (at 13, 20, 22-23) that Congress can more readily cabin \nremoval of inferior (versus principal) officers.  Others defending removal restrictions have argued \nsimilarly.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Mot. for a TRO & Prelim. Inj. & Mem. in Supp. of Same at 15, Storch \nv. Hegseth, No. 1:25-cv-00415-ACR (D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2025).  But the Board, no one disputes, \ncomprises principal officers, while ALJs typically qualify as inferior officers.  U.S. Br. 3-4.  So if \nanything Plaintiff’s conception of Article II favors solving the Board’s Free Enterprise Fund \nproblem by enjoining the Board’s principal-officer removal protections, not inferior-officer ALJs’.       \nTo be sure, Article II, best read, renders all for-cause restrictions on Executive-Branch \nofficers highly suspect.  See Morrison, 487 U.S. at 715-27 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But if nothing \nelse, Free Enterprise Fund teaches that a novel scheme1 imposing double for-cause restrictions on \n \n1 Far from reflecting longstanding “history and tradition,” Pl.’s Mot. 20, the Board’s for-cause \nscheme is novel.  Originally, the “members of the Civil Service Commission”—the Board’s \npredecessor agency—“were removable at will by the President.”  Fleming, 987 F.3d at 1116-17 \n(Rao, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). “It was not until 1978 that Congress established \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board” and the attending removal restrictions which have led to \nALJs’ double-for-cause protection.  Id. at 1117.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 37     Filed 03/01/25     Page 17 of 18\nthe President’s ability to remove executive officers like ALJs cannot pass constitutional muster.  \nMaintaining the Board’s for-cause removal protections carries  forward just such a scheme.  \nReducing the President to “cajoler-in-chief” twice over defies Article II and the Supreme Court’s \nrecent precedents interpreting it.  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 502.  Enforcing the President’s \npower to supervise the Board’s membership, by contrast, avoids that independent constitutional \nproblem. \nCONCLUSION \n  The foregoing arguments support denying the Plaintiff’s requested relief.   \n \nDated: March 1, 2025 \n  JONATHAN SKRMETTI \nTennessee Attorney General  \n  & Reporter \n/s/ Whitney Hermandorfer \n  WHITNEY HERMANDORFER (DC Bar #888314222) \n   Director of Strategic Litigation \nJOSEPH M.

This case is not among them.  As the Court explained in its TRO decision (at 8), \nthis case is “on all fours with Humphrey’s Executor” and its progeny.  The Merit Systems Protection \nBoard is a “multimember body,” whose members must be experts in federal employment law, \nwhich by law must be “balanced along partisan lines,” and which exercises quintessential “quasi-\njudicial duties.”  Mem. Op. (“TRO Op.”) at 8-9, ECF No. 9 (quoting Seila L. LLC v. CFPB, 591 \nU.S. 197, 216 (2020), and Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 624 (1935)).  The \n“three-member ‘adjudicatory body,’ ” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216 (quoting Wiener v. United States, \n357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958)), “conducts preliminary adjudication of federal employees’ claims, \nwhich may then be appealed” to an Article III court.  TRO Op. at 9.  The Board does not “wield \nsubstantial executive power,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218, and its limited authority does not \n“interfere impermissibly with” the President’s “constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful \nexecution of the laws,” Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 693 (1988).  And to ensure this bipartisan \nadjudicatory Board would remain insulated from politics, Congress mandated that its members \nmay only be removed for good cause.  Under Humphrey’s Executor, that removal standard is \nunquestionably constitutional.  \nIn fact, it is difficult to point to a body that would fall more squarely on the constitutional \nside of the line than the Merit Systems Protection Board.  As this Court has underscored, the \nBoard’s unique “mission and purpose require independence.”  TRO Op. at 10.  The Board does \nnot make policy by filling up vaguely defined statutes to regulate unfair competition or set \nreasonable prices.  The Board hears targeted case-specific claims regarding unlawful abuse within \nthe executive branch—including adverse actions taken against civil servants based on partisan \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 13 of 50\ndiscrimination or in retaliation for whistleblowing.  Congress reasonably determined that the Board \ncannot fulfill that adjudicatory mission if its members face a risk that, when they apply the laws \nCongress passed to “limit, restrict, and regulate the removal” of federal employees, the members \nwill be subject to political retribution.  United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886).   \nNow more than ever, the Board’s actual impartiality and the appearance of impartiality are \ncritical.  Recent executive orders regarding federal employees have resulted in a ten-fold increase \nin the number of cases before the Board.  It is imperative that everyone—civil servants, courts, \nand the public at large—has confidence in the Board’s ability to do its job, free from fear or favor.  \nIt is in the government’s interest, too, to ensure impartiality, so that when the Board rules for the \ngovernment over an employee, everyone accepts its decisions as fair.  \nIn opposing a temporary restraining order, Defendants attempted to distinguish the Merit \nSystems Protection Board from Humphrey’s Executor and its progeny.  Their arguments are paper \nthin.  At the end of the day, even the government acknowledges that “Humphrey’s Executor is \nbinding on this Court,” and signals that it desires to create a vehicle with which to ask the Supreme \nCourt to “overturn” landmark precedent.  Defs’ TRO Resp. at 8 n.1, ECF No. 6.  But let’s be clear: \nIf the members of the Merit Systems Protection Board cannot enjoy a modicum of protection from \narbitrary removal, then no multimember commission can—and perhaps not even ordinary civil \nservants.  This Court should reject Defendants’ request to ignore binding Supreme Court precedent, \nrule for Plaintiff on the merits, and issue both a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction \nin her favor.1 \n \n1 To the extent the Court does not issue its decision within 14 days of the entry of the TRO, Plaintiff \nrequests that the Court extend the TRO.  Good cause exists for an extension.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n65(b)(2).  None of the harms from denying temporary relief have dissipated during the pendency \nof  this  case.   Defendants  have  not,  and  will  not,  identify  “impending  injury  or  alleged \nconstitutional error” that would “outweigh” that harm.  See Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-0385, \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 14 of 50\nFACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Legal Background. \nIn 1978, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act to address widespread public \nconcerns about the federal civil service and to ensure “efficient and effective” government \n“impartially administered” by employees selected and retained on merit rather than by political \nfavoritism.  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 4 (1978); see Pub. L. No. 95–454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978).  A \ncritical piece of the Act was the new Merit Systems Protection Board, which assumed the former \nCivil Service Commission’s federal employee adjudicatory authority. \nIn a letter to Congress, President Carter proposed what eventually became the Civil \nService Reform Act, and specifically requested that Congress create a “Merit Protection Board” \nwhose members would be removable only for cause.  He explained that the board was necessary \nto “guarantee independent and impartial protection to employees” and “safeguard the rights of \nFederal  employees  who  ‘blow  the  whistle’  on  violations  of  laws  or  regulations  by  other \nemployees, including their supervisors.”2 \nOver the following seven months, Congress formulated President Carter’s proposal into \nlegislation.  Throughout the process, members of Congress from both parties emphasized that a \n“strong Merit Systems Protection Board” was essential to “absolutely insure against any form of \ndestructive political manipulation” of the civil service.  124 CONG. REC. 27566 (1978) (statement \nof Sen. Percy); see 124 CONG. REC. 27535 (1978) (statement of Sen. Ribicoff); S. Rep. No. 95-\n \n2025 WL 471022, at *13 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025).  If it is necessary to extend the TRO beyond that \nadditional 14-day period and if the government does not consent to an extension of the TRO, see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2), Plaintiff also requests that the Court grant Plaintiff’s motion for a \npreliminary injunction. \n2  Jimmy  Carter,  Federal  Civil  Service  Reform  Message  to  the  Congress,  THE  AMERICAN \nPRESIDENCY PROJECT (Mar. 2, 1978), https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/federal-civil-\nservice-reform-message-the-congress. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 15 of 50\n969, at 6 (1978) (explaining that a “strong and independent” Board was necessary to serve as a \n“vigorous protector” of merit principles). \nTo ensure the new Board’s independence, Congress provided that its members “may be \nremoved by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Civil \nService Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, 1122 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1202).  In Congress’s assessment, the Civil Service Commission’s lack of for-cause protections \nhad hampered its ability to protect the merit-based civil service.  124 CONG. REC. 27536 (1978).  \nWhen President Carter signed the Civil Service Reform Act into law, he declared that the \n“landmark legislation” would create “a new system of excellence and accountability.”3 \nThe Board’s primary mission is “to provide the people of the United States with a \ncompetent, honest, and productive Federal workforce,” and to ensure that “Federal personnel \nmanagement is implemented consistent with merit systems principles and free from prohibited \npersonnel practices,” including discrimination and reprisal for whistleblowing. Civil Service \nReform Act, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, 1112 (1978).  \nThe Board has a carefully tailored jurisdiction and exists only to conduct a “preliminary \nadjudication of federal employees’ claims.”  TRO Op. at 9 (emphasis added).  It hears a narrow \nrange of inward-facing personnel matters, including: \n•  Claims  of  federal  employees  being  targeted  due  to  partisan  political  affiliation.  \n5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1).  See, e.g., Hollingsworth v. Dep’t of Hous. and Urb. Dev., MSPB \nDkt.  No.  DC-315H-21-0101-I-1  (Nov.  26,  2024)  (considering  claim  that  HUD \nemployee was terminated because she was a Republican and did not support President \nBiden in the 2020 election). \n \n3 Jimmy Carter, Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S, 2640 Into Law, THE \nAMERICAN  PRESIDENCY  PROJECT  (Oct.  13,  1978), \nhttps://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/civil-service-reform-act-1978-statement-signing-s-\n2640-into-law. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 16 of 50\n•  Claims of whistleblower retaliation against federal employees for having reported a \nviolation of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, among other abuses \nof authority.  5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8).  See, e.g., Smith v. Dep’t of the Army, 2022 MSPB \n4, MSPB Dkt No. PH-1221-16-0010-W-1 (Apr. 13, 2022) (finding actions against \nemployee were influenced by her complaints about the U.S. military’s mishandling of \nthe remains of her husband, who had been killed in action while deployed in Iraq). \n•  Claims that federal employees have violated the Hatch Political Activities Act by \nengaging in prohibited political activities while on duty.  5 U.S.C. § 7324.  See, e.g., \nSpecial Couns. v. Sims, 2006 MSPB 151, MSPB Dkt No. CB-1216-05-0013-T-1, CB-\n1216-05-0012-T-1  (June  12,  2006)  (reversing  dismissal  of  claim  against  federal \nemployee who forwarded an email while on duty with the subject line stating “Why I \nam supporting John Kerry for President”).  \n•  Claims of discrimination raised in response to an adverse personnel action.  5 U.S.C. § \n7702.  See e.g., Heffernan v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 2007 MSPB 246, \nMSPB  Dkt  DC-0752-04-0756-P-1  (awarding  compensatory  damages  to  Roman \nCatholic priest Chaplain who was fired due to religious discrimination and retaliation).  \n \n•  Claims by U.S. military service members and veterans who had been denied the right \nto be reemployed in their federal civil service positions upon return from military \nservice.  38 U.S.C. §§ 4312-15. See, e.g., Patrie v. U.S. Postal Serv., MSPB Dkt. No. \nPH-4324-18-0222-I-2 (Aug. 23, 2023), vacated as moot, MSPB Dkt. No. PH-4324-18-\n0222-R-1 (Jan. 25, 2024) (finding violation of reemployment rights of National Guard \nmember who sought reemployment at USPS following honorable discharge from active \nduty  in  the  Global  War  on  Terrorism,  including  “Operation  Noble  Eagle”  and \n“Operation Enduring Freedom”). \n•  Claims that veterans’ preference rights were violated.  5 U.S.C. § 3330a.  See, e.g., \nWhite v. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., MSPB Dkt. No. DA-3330-15-0044-P-2 (Feb. 24, 2023) \n(finding  violation  where  applicant’s  veterans’  preference-eligible  status  was  not \nconsidered in making hiring decision). \nThe Board’s jurisdiction is also limited in other respects.  For example, the Board may \nnot hear adverse action appeals by political appointees, 5 U.S.C. § 7511, it has limited authority \nto hear certain appeals by senior civil servants, see id. § 3592(a), and it cannot adjudicate the \nmerits of issues regarding national security.  See Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148, 1166 (Fed. \nCir. 2013) (en banc).  An employee may appeal the Board’s adverse determination to an Article \nIII court, which is usually but not always the Federal Circuit.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703(a).  The \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 17 of 50\ngovernment through the director of the Office of Personnel Management may similarly petition \nan Article III court to hear cases that “will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, \nregulation, or policy directive.”  See id. § 7703(d)(1)-(2).   \nThe  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  is  structured  as  a  traditional  multimember \nadjudicatory body with three members.  All members must be nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate.  By law, each member must be an “individual[] who, by demonstrated ability, \nbackground, training, or experience are especially qualified to carry out the functions of the Board.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 1201.  Once confirmed, members serve seven-year terms and, if a successor has not yet \nbeen appointed, a member may serve an additional year.  The members’ terms are staggered, and \nno more than two of the three Board members may be adherents to the same political party.  Id.  \n  In the nearly half-century of its existence, the Board has adjudicated well over one hundred \nfifty thousand employee appeals.  While small and largely unheralded, the Board is truly a \nworkhorse.  The Board’s administrative judges issue roughly 5,000 decisions each year, and “about \n400-600 cases are filed each year at the appellate level” before the Board.  Ex. 1, Harris Decl. ¶ 16; \nsee id. ¶ 34 (describing “400 new appeals per month at the regional level”).  Additionally, the \nBoard offers parties access to the Mediation Appeals Program, which uses trained mediators to \nmediate cases and seek informal resolutions.4   \nIn the past few weeks, the Board has seen an extraordinary surge in new filings.  Ordinarily \nthe Board will receive about 400 new appeals per month at the regional level.  But since February \n9, 2025, the Board has received more than 1,600 new appeals.  See id. ¶ 34. \n \n4  See  Mediation  Appeals  Program  (MAP),  U.S.  MERIT  SYSTEMS  PROTECTION  BOARD, \nhttps://www.mspb.gov/appeals/mediationappeals.htm. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 18 of 50\nII.  Factual Background. \n The facts of this case are straightforward and undisputed.  Plaintiff Cathy Harris was \nnominated by President Biden to be a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board in January \n2022.  The Senate confirmed her on May 25, 2022, and she was sworn in on June 1, 2022.5  Harris’s \ncurrent term expires on March 1, 2028.  Shortly after being sworn in, President Biden designated \nher as Vice Chairman, and she served as Acting Chairman of the Board until March 6, 2024, when \nthe Senate confirmed her as Chairman.  Harris was sworn in as Chairman of the Board on March \n14, 2024.6 \nOn February 11, 2025, Harris received an email from Trent Morse, Deputy Assistant to the \nPresident and the Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, which stated \nin its entirety: “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your \nposition on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.  Thank you \nfor your service[.]”  Ex. 2. \nThe one-sentence email does not allege any inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office.  Nor would there have been a basis for such an allegation.  During her time as a member \nof the Board, Harris has been extremely efficient and effective.  Between 2017 and 2022, the Board \nlacked a quorum and could therefore not vote on any appellate-level cases.  This produced a \nbacklog of 3,793 cases.  When she joined the Board as a member in June 2022, Harris was told it \nwould take five to six years to issue decisions on those thousands of outstanding cases.  See Harris \n \n5 William Spencer, MSPB Welcomes Acting Chairman Cathy A. Harris, U.S. MERIT SYSTEMS \nPROTECTION  BOARD  (June  6,  2022), \nhttps://www.mspb.gov/publicaffairs/press_releases/Cathy_Harris_Press_Release_1930967.pdf. \n6 William Spencer, New MSPB Chairman and Vice Chairman, U.S. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION \nBOARD  (Mar.  14,  2024), \nhttps://www.mspb.gov/publicaffairs/press_releases/New_MSPB_Chairman_and_Vice%20Chair\nman.pdf. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 19 of 50\nDecl. ¶9.  Since that time, however, the Board has been able to issue decisions on all but 32 of \nthose 3,793 cases, while simultaneously keeping up with newly filed cases.  See id. ¶15.  \nIII.  Procedural History. \nHarris filed this action on February 11, 2025—the day after she received notice of her \nunlawful termination.  Compl., ECF No. 1.  In addition to requesting a writ of mandamus and any \nother appropriate relief, the Complaint requests: (1) a declaration that her purported termination \nwas unlawful and that she remains a member of the Board who may be removed “ ‘only for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,’ ” id. at 11; and (2) an order enjoining \nDefendants from removing Harris from office, treating her as being removed, or exercising \nauthority with respect to the Board “without regard” to Harris’s position as a board member, id.7   \nOn the same day that she initiated this suit, Harris moved for a temporary restraining order \nto preserve the status quo while the parties briefed injunctive relief and the merits.  ECF No. 2; \nECF No. 2-1 at 5-6.  One week later, on February 18, the Court granted Harris’s motion and issued \na temporary restraining order stating that Harris would continue to serve as Chairman of the Board \nand enjoining Defendants from removing her from office.  ECF No. 9.8    \nIn the opinion accompanying the TRO, the Court explained that Harris would likely \nsucceed on the merits because Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), \n“appears to dictate the outcome of this case.”  Id. at 6.  The Court found irreparable harm based on \n \n7 For ease of reference, references to the Complaint use the document’s ECF pagination. \n8 Harris does not contest that the President may remove her from her position as Chairman of the \nBoard, leaving her as a member.  The post of Chairman is not subject to for-cause removal.  5 \nU.S.C. § 1203(a).  At the time of her removal, the President had announced that he intended to \ndesignate member Henry J. Kerner as Acting Chair, although the President had not yet designated \nKerner as Vice Chairman, which in turn would permit Kerner to become Acting Chair.  Id. \n§ 1203(b).  At this time, Harris does not request that she be reinstated as Chairman, but instead \nmerely as a Board member, and requests that the Court modify the TRO accordingly.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 20 of 50\nHarris’s “loss of the ability” to perform the mission “specifically directed” by Congress, the \nresulting deprivation of her “statutory right” to function as a Board member, and the corresponding \nharm to the Board’s independence.  Id. at 15 (quotation marks omitted).  The Court also determined \nthat the remaining injunctive relief factors favored Harris because there is a strong public interest \nin “governmental agencies abiding by the federal laws.”  Id. at 20 (same).  \nWhen it issued the TRO, the Court ordered expedited preliminary injunction briefing and \nscheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for March 3.  ECF No. 8 at 2.  The next day, the parties \nfiled a joint status report confirming their agreement to consolidate the motion for preliminary \ninjunction with the merits of the case.  ECF No. 13 at 1.   \nOn February 20, Defendants appealed the TRO after it had been in effect for just two days \nand moved for an emergency stay pending appeal.  ECF No. 14, 16.  The Court denied emergency \nrelief based on the already-expedited briefing schedule and found that the government would not \nbe irreparably harmed by following the law in the interim, “particularly one supported by at least \nninety years of Supreme Court precedent.”  ECF No. 18 at 2.  Defendants’ TRO appeal remains \npending as of the filing of this motion.9  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nCourts apply the summary judgment standard where a preliminary injunction hearing is \nconsolidated with a trial on the merits under Rule 65(a)(2), “the record is sufficient for a \ndetermination on the merits,” and there “are no material fact disputes.”  Mar. for Life v. Burwell, \n \n9 On February 15, 2025, the D.C. Circuit dismissed a similar appeal for lack of jurisdiction in a \ncase involving the purported removal of the Special Counsel, in which Judge Jackson also issued \na TRO.  See Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (per \ncuriam).  The government sought an application in the Supreme Court seeking vacatur of Judge \nJackson’s TRO.  On February 21, 2025, the  Supreme Court issued a decision holding the \napplication in abeyance until February 26, 2025, the date Judge Jackson will hear a motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 21 of 50\n128 F. Supp. 3d 116, 124 (D.D.C. 2015); see also Minute Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-\n385 (D.D.C. Feb. 15, 2025) (ordering the case consolidated pursuant to Rule 65(a)(2) and directing \nthe parties to submit cross motions for summary judgment).  \nPursuant to the Declaratory Judgement Act, a court may declare the rights and legal \nrelations of any party that requests it in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction.  28 \nU.S.C. § 2201.  When assessing whether to grant declaratory relief, courts have looked to “whether \nit would finally settle the controversy between the parties; whether other remedies are available or \nother proceedings pending; the convenience of the parties; the equity of the conduct of the \ndeclaratory judgment plaintiff; prevention of ‘procedural fencing’; the state of the record; the \ndegree of adverseness between the parties; and the public importance of the question to be \ndecided.”  Hanes Corp. v. Millard, 531 F.2d 585, 591 n.4. (D.C. Cir. 1976).  Courts in this Circuit \nhave traditionally granted a declaratory judgement when doing so would either “ ‘serve a useful \npurpose in clarifying the legal relations in issue’ ” or “terminate and afford relief from the \nuncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.’ ”  President v. Vance, 627 \nF.2d 353, 364 n.76 (D.C. Cir. 1980). \nThe preliminary injunction factors mirror those the Court applied in granting a TRO: \nPlaintiff must show (1) she is “likely to succeed on the merits”; (2) that she is “likely to suffer \nirreparable harm” absent preliminary relief; (3) that the “balance of equities” tips in her favor; and \n(4) that an injunction is in “the public interest.”  Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 79 F. Supp. \n3d 174, 185 (D.D.C.), aff’d, 808 F.3d 905 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). \nA plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate: (1) “an irreparable injury, (2) \nthat remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 22 of 50\ninjury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy \nin equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent \ninjunction.”  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).  For a permanent \ninjunction, a plaintiff must show “actual success” on the merits.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 32.  Factors \n(3) and (4) merge when the defendant is the government.  Singh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 107 (D.C. \nCir. 2023) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  \nARGUMENT  \nI.  This Case Falls Squarely Within The Heartland Of Humphrey’s Executor And Its \nProgeny. \nSince the Founding, the Supreme Court has recognized Congress’s authority to regulate \nthe  removal  of  federal  employees  and  officers.    In  1887,  Congress  established  the  first \nmultimember board whose members are entitled to for-cause removal protection.  See Interstate \nCommerce Act, Pub. L. No. 49-104, 24 Stat. 379, 383 (1887).  Starting with Humphrey’s Executor \nin 1935, the Supreme Court has consistently blessed these “traditional” “multimember board[s] or \ncommission[s],” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207, which “exercise predominantly quasi judicial and \nquasi legislative” functions, Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624; see, e.g., Wiener, 357 U.S. at \n356.  In a pair of recent cases, Collins and Seila Law, the Court struck down for-cause removal \nprovisions for two novel independent agencies created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. \nBoth were headed by a single director who wielded significant executive authority and were funded \noutside the normal appropriations process.  See Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 220, 253 (2021); \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 218; see also Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 495 (2010).  The \nCourt in both cases was careful to distinguish and preserve Humphrey’s Executor.  \nThe Board looks nothing like the novel entities at issue in Collins and Seila Law.  Instead, \nas the United States all but acknowledges, see Defs’ TRO Resp. at 8 n.1, and as this Court already \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 23 of 50\nheld, this case is “on all fours with Humphrey’s Executor” and its progeny, TRO Op. at 8.  Indeed, \nif the Merit Systems Protection Board’s members may not be limited to for-cause removal, it is \ndifficult to imagine that any member of any commission could ever receive that protection.  This \nCourt should decline the government’s effort to evade binding precedent, and rule for Harris on \nthe merits.   \nA.  The Board Does Not Wield Substantial Executive Power. \nThe for-cause removal protection at issue in this case is constitutional because the Merit \nSystems  Protection  Board  does  “not  wield  substantial  executive  power,”  or  “interfere \nimpermissibly with” the President’s “constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of \nthe laws,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218; Morrison, 487 U.S. at 693.  Rather, the Board is the kind of \n“quasi judicial,” “adjudicatory body” that Congress may determine requires a measure of “freedom \nfrom Executive interference” to function.  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629; Collins, 594 \nU.S. at 250 n.18 (quoting Wiener, 357 U.S. at 353).  If Congress cannot provide the members of \nthe Board for-cause removal protection, it is not clear that Congress may provide anyone that \nprotection, including potentially even ordinary civil servants.  See Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690 n.20. \nAs this Court outlined in its TRO opinion, the Board’s authority is circumscribed.  The \nBoard does not regulate private parties, let alone “dictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of \nthe economy affecting millions of Americans.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  The Board “lacks its \nown rulemaking authority” except in furtherance of its adjudicatory functions, and aside from \nsubmitting reports to Congress, its role is essentially adjudicative.  TRO Op. at 9.  Like Article III \ncourts, the Board cannot initiate cases itself, it must passively wait for them to be brought.10  See \n \n10 The only instance where the Board can initiate any type of proceeding on its own is when it may \nconduct a limited review of regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management.  See \n5 U.S.C. § 1204(f)(1)(A).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 24 of 50\n5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); cf. Alexander Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch: The Supreme Court at the \nBar of Politics (1962).  The Board, moreover, is focused entirely inward on the treatment of federal \nworkers  who  allege  they  have  been  subject  to  unlawful  employment  actions,  including \ndiscrimination and retaliation.  See supra pp. 4-5.  The Board’s case-specific adjudicatory role is \nvastly different from entities that exercise considerable policymaking discretion to fill out vague \nstandards (for example, to prohibit unfair practices), whose members could theoretically stymie \nthe President’s lawful goals in office.   \nThere are strong reasons to defer to Congress’s judgment that, of all the boards and \ncommissions across the federal government, the members of the Merit Systems Protection Board \nrequire a modest degree of protection.  As the Supreme Court has long recognized, Congress \npossesses  constitutional  “authority  to  limit,  restrict,  and  regulate  the  removal”  of  federal \nemployees and inferior officers.  Perkins, 116 U.S. at 485; see U.S. Const. art. II, § 2 (“[T]he \nCongress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.”); Humphrey’s Executor \n295 U.S. at 631 (“In Marbury v. Madison, it is made clear that Chief Justice Marshall was of \nopinion that a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia was not removable at the will of the \nPresident.”) (internal citation omitted); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 161 (1926) (“The \ncourt also has recognized in the Perkins Case that Congress, in committing the appointment of \nsuch inferior officers to the heads of departments, may prescribe incidental regulations controlling \nand restricting the latter in the exercise of the power of removal.”).   \nThe Merit Systems Protection Board’s central purpose is to further Congress’s lawful \nregulation of the civil service, and to protect federal employees against unlawful discrimination \nand retaliation from within the executive branch itself.  Congress has determined that the Board \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 25 of 50\ncannot perform that mission if the Board’s members themselves are subject to similar retaliation.  \nAs  this  Court  aptly  explained,  “[d]enying  independence  to  the  Board  would  undermine” \n“constitutionally sound limitations on the removal of civil servants.”  TRO Op. at 10 n.2.  It would \n“neuter” the “Civil Service Reform Act’s” statutory scheme if “high-ranking government officials” \ncould “engage in prohibited practices,” such as “discrimination, loyalty oaths, coercion to engage \nin political activity, and retaliation against whistleblowers,” “and then pressure the” Board “into \ninaction.”  Id. at 10.   \nAt the same time, Congress has tailored the Board’s structure to avoid encroaching on the \nPresident’s core prerogatives to manage the executive branch, within the laws Congress passed \nand the President signed.  As an initial matter, by making an internal board that specializes in \nfederal employment issues the first port of call for employee grievances—rather than, for example, \nan Article III court—Congress reduced the potential for interbranch friction.  It would be more \nconcerning from a separation of powers perspective—not less—if Congress had required an \nArticle III entity to resolve every federal employment dispute.  In this respect, the government’s \narguments at the TRO stage rebound on them.  If the government thinks that having an Article III \ncourt issue relief in this case far too intrusive, see Defs. TRO Resp. at 12, surely the government \nwould not wish for an Article III court to be the initial and exclusive option for federal employees \nin every case.  By contrast, housing a specialized Merit Systems Protection Board within the \nexecutive branch ensures that the Board will have expertise in executive branch equities, including \nthe particular ways in which agencies manage their staff.  Moreover, as compared to generalist \nArticle III judges, the specialized Board can more effectively mediate cases and reach informal \nresolutions that reduce the impact on agencies and the need for the executive to engage in full \nblown litigation in a trial court.  See Mediation Appeals Program (MAP), U.S. MERIT SYSTEMS \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 26 of 50\nPROTECTION BOARD, https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/mediationappeals.htm (explaining that the \nBoard’s mediation program settles “50% of all cases mediated” in the program and more “will \nlater settle after returning to the traditional adjudication track”).  At the same time, the fact that \nCongress could have “given jurisdiction over employment” claims “to the District Courts or to the \nCourt of Claims” confirms that the Board is truly the kind of adjudicatory body that does not wield \nsubstantial executive power.  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 355.  \nTo further protect the President’s core removal powers, Congress has also limited the \nBoard’s jurisdiction.  The Board can only hear adverse action appeals regarding civil servants and \ncannot adjudicate cases regarding political appointees.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7511.  Even for civil \nservants, the Board’s powers are circumscribed.  For example, when a federal employee in the \nSenior Executive Service is removed from a position “for less than fully successful executive \nperformance,” she may receive only an informal hearing, and removal from the Senior Executive \nService can occur before that informal meeting.  5 U.S.C. § 3592(a)(2).  Similarly, to protect the \nPresident’s powers as Commander in Chief, the Board cannot “review the merits” of “national \nsecurity determinations concerning eligibility of an employee to occupy a sensitive position that \nimplicates national security.”  Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (en banc); \nsee Dep’t of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988).  In short, Congress ensured the Board does \nnot trample on the President’s core policymaking authority or wield significant executive power.   \nNor does the Board have the final say in the most significant matters.  As this Court \nexplained, the Board effectively conducts a “preliminary adjudication of federal employees’ \nclaims.”  TRO Op. at 9 (emphasis added).  An employee may appeal the Board’s adverse \ndetermination to the Article III courts, which is usually but not always the Federal Circuit.  \n5 U.S.C. § 7703(a); see Perry, 582 U.S. 420 at 425 (outlining appeals to regional circuits for \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 27 of 50\ncertain cases).11  The government through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management \nmay similarly petition the relevant Court of Appeals to hear cases that the Director determines \n“will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.”  See id. \n§ 7703(d)(1)-(2).12  This structure ensures that, where the President disagrees with the Board over \na meaningful question of executive power, the President can nevertheless advance his preferred \napproach.   \nThe Board’s circumscribed adjudicatory authority contrasts sharply with the recent cases \nin which the Supreme Court has concluded that an unaccountable, independent agency wielded \n“substantial executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  For example, in Seila Law, the \nSupreme Court struck down for-cause removal protections for the director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Court explained that the director was “insulated from \nPresidential control” and could “dictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of the economy \naffecting millions of Americans.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204, 218, 225.  Far from case-by-case \nadjudication based on settled legal principles, the Bureau possesses extremely broad rulemaking \nauthority to prevent “any unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice” by certain participants in \nthe consumer-finance sector.  Id. at 206.  The Bureau, moreover, may engage in enforcement \nactions against private parties, pursuing “restitution, disgorgement, and injunctive relief, as well \nas” staggering “civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 (inflation adjusted) for each day that a violation \noccurs.”  Id.   \n \n11 Typically, judicial review of Board cases lies in the Federal Circuit.  So called “mixed cases” \nincluding claims under employment discrimination laws like Title VII proceed to district courts in \nthe first instance.  Regional courts of appeal may review whistleblower cases. \n12 This provision permits the Director to seek review, for example, of a decision reinstating a \nterminated employee or reassigning one.  See, e.g., Archuleta v. Miller, 562 F. App’x 978 (Fed. \nCir. 2014) (granting Director’s request for review). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 28 of 50\nMeanwhile, in Collins, the Supreme Court struck down a similar for-cause removal \nprotection for the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).  That agency regulates \nmortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which in 2007 “had a combined value of \napproximately $5 trillion,” and supervises “nearly every aspect of the companies’ management \nand operations.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 228-230.  Like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nthe agency can “impose penalties ranging from $2,000 to $2 million per day;” “must approve any \nnew products that the companies would like to offer;” and “may order the companies to dispose of \nor acquire any asset”—to name just a few powers.  Id. at 230.  Given the centrality of home \nmortgages to the American economy, the agency’s actions “could have an immediate impact on \nmillions of private individuals and the economy at large.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 253.  \nIt should go without saying, but we say it anyway:  The Merit Systems Protection Board is \nnothing like those agencies by a country mile, and it does not wield the kind of “substantial \nexecutive power” that raises a profound constitutional concern.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  \nInstead, it is the kind of adjudicatory body that the Supreme Court has long blessed. \nB.  The Board Is A Traditional Multimember Body. \nThe Merit Systems Protection Board also falls within the heartland of the Humphrey’s \nExecutor framework for a second critical reason:  It is “a traditional independent agency” “run by \na multimember board.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 206.   \nWhen the Supreme Court has faced a traditional, multimember board or commission, the \nCourt has easily rejected the constitutional challenge to a for-cause removal provision.  See \nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 410 (1989) (upholding for-cause removal protections for \nthe Sentencing Commission); Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356 (War Claims Commission); Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 632 (Federal Trade Commission).  By contrast, when the Supreme Court \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 29 of 50\nstruck down for-cause removal provisions in Seila Law and Collins, the Court emphasized that the \nindependent agencies in question had a novel and non-traditional structure, i.e., they were led by \na single director.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; Collins, 594 U.S. at 251; see also Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 496 (“This novel structure . . .”); cf. Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S at 626 \n(explaining that Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), stands for “the narrow point” “that \nthe President had power to remove a postmaster of the first class, without the advice and consent \nof the Senate as required by act of Congress”). \nIn those latter cases—and in particular, Seila Law—the Supreme Court contrasted the \nnovel, unconstitutional agencies in question with the traditional and permissible multimember \nstructure.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207 (“Rather than create a traditional independent agency \nheaded by a multimember board or commission . . . .”); id. at 216 (“Humphrey’s Executor permitted \nCongress to give for-cause removal protections to a multimember body of experts.”); id. at 218 \n(noting Congress may choose to provide “multimember expert agencies” for-cause protection); id. \nat 237 (noting that Congress could convert “the CFPB into a multimember agency” via legislation, \nbut the Court could not do so unilaterally); see also Collins, 594 U.S. at 253 n.19 (contrasting the \nstructure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency with “a multi-member Commission.”); Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 501 (“The point is not to take issue with for-cause limitations in general; \nwe do not do that.”). \nAs this Court’s TRO decision recognizes (at 8-9), the distinction between multimember \nboards and single-director agencies is constitutionally significant.  By their nature, multimember \nentities do not concentrate “power in the hands of any single individual,” consistent with the \nFramers’ design of divided government.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 223.  Meanwhile, the traditional \nrequirement  that  a  multimember  board  contain  members  from  both  parties  ensures  that  its \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 30 of 50\nadjudicatory decisions are respected as “nonpartisan” and “impartial[].”  Humphrey’s Executor, \n295 U.S. at 624.  The assurance of impartiality is particularly critical for the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, which hears claims regarding unlawful retaliation, and is already receiving ten \ntimes the number of cases as it normally would.  See supra p.6.   \nBecause members of traditional multimember bodies serve staggered terms, moreover, a \nPresident  is  assured  of  appointing  at  least  some  members  to  the  board,  ensuring  that  the \nmultimember body reflects the results of nationwide presidential elections.  See Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 225 (“[T]he agency’s single-Director structure means the President will not have the \nopportunity to appoint any other leaders—such as a chair or fellow members of a Commission or \nBoard—who can serve as a check on the Director’s authority and help bring the agency in line \nwith the President’s preferred policies.”).  “[S]taggered” “terms” additionally ensure that the Board \ncan “accumulate technical expertise” in a unique area—federal employment law—over time.  Id. \nat 216; accord Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624 (“It is manifestly desirable that the terms of \nthe commissioners shall be long enough to give them an opportunity to acquire the expertness in \ndealing  with  these  special  questions  concerning  industry  that  comes  from  experience.”).  \nMeanwhile, the President may typically replace the chairperson of the board or commission, \nproviding him a further measure of control.13   \nThe Merit Systems Protection Board also notably lacks the unique permanent funding \nfeatures that insulated the CFPB and the FHFA from the constitutional “appropriations process,” \nand further “aggravate[d] the” “threat to Presidential control” in Seila and Collins.  Id. at 226.  The \n \n13 As noted supra p. 8 n.8, Plaintiff does not contest the President’s authority to demote her from \nher position as Chairman and assign her as a member of the Board.  Defendants have not raised \nthis issue, perhaps because they realize it undercuts their position regarding the President’s ability \nto exercise control over the Board. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 31 of 50\n“President normally has the opportunity to recommend or veto spending bills that affect the \noperation of administrative agencies” and to submit “a proposed budget to Congress for approval.”  \nId.  But both the CFPB and the FHFA received funding outside of that process, which made it \n“even more likely that the agency” would “slip from the Executive’s control, and thus from that of \nthe people.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted); see Collins, 594 U.S. at 231 (“[T]he FHFA is not \nfunded  through  the  ordinary  appropriations  process.”).    That  the  Board  is  subject  to  the \nappropriations process confirms that the Board is a traditional and permissible multimember body. \nC.  Ruling For Defendants Would Upend Constitutional Law. \nAdopting the cramped interpretation of Humphrey’s Executor advanced by the government \nin this case—which the government essentially acknowledges requires overturning it, TRO Op. at \n8 n.1—would represent a sharp departure from the nation’s history and tradition and would herald \nan unprecedented revolution in the structure of the federal government that could potentially \nimpact every federal employee.  That is yet another reason to reject Defendants’ arguments.   \nSince Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court has consistently recognized that Congress \nhas the constitutional authority to “regulate” “removal” of employees and inferior officers—the \nprecise goal the Board’s independent members further.  Perkins, 116 U.S. at 485; see Humphrey’s \nExecutor 295 U.S. at 631; see supra p. 13.  Even in Myers, the brief high-water mark for the \nmaximalist interpretation of the President’s removal power, the Supreme Court recognized that \nCongress could to some degree limit “the exercise of the power of removal.”  Myers, 272 U.S. at \n161.  The result of that historical process is a fully merit-based civil service, in which a Republican \nfederal employee can rest assured that a Democratic President cannot fire him for his political \nbeliefs and vice versa.  The Merit Systems Protection Board is integral to that goal.  See supra pp. \n3-4.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 32 of 50\nMultimember  boards  with  a  degree  of  for-cause  protection  have  existed  since  the \nNineteenth Century.  Congress established the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887.14  See \nInterstate Commerce Act, Pub. L. No. 49-104, 24 Stat. 379, 383 (1887) (members removable for \n“inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office”).  The Federal Reserve followed in 1913, \nand the Federal Trade Commission a year later.  See Federal Reserve Act, Pub. L. No. 63-48, 38 \nStat. 251, 260 (1913) (providing members are removable “for cause”); Federal Trade Commission \nAct, Pub. L. No. 63-203, 38 Stat. 717, 718 (1914) (providing commissioners are removable “for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office”).  Today, the multimember bodies whose \nmembers are entitled to for-cause removal protection include, to name just a few: the National \nLabor Relations Board; the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission; the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission; the Federal Energy Regulation Commission; the Chemical Safety and Hazard \nInvestigation Board; the Postal Regulatory Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health \nReview Commission; and the Federal Maritime Commission.15   \nThis long and unbroken history is constitutionally significant, particularly in a separation \nof powers case like this one in which the constitutional text is indeterminate.  As Justice Kagan—\njoined by Justices Sotomayor, Barrett, and Kavanaugh—recently explained “[l]ong settled and \nestablished practice” carries “great weight” “in interpreting constitutional provisions about the \n \n14 Bipartisan multimember boards without for-cause protection are even older.  See, e.g., An Act \nto Amend Section Fifty-Three Hundred and Fifty-Two of the Revised Statutes of the United States, \nin Reference to Bigamy, and for Other Purposes, 47 Cong. Ch. 47, 22 Stat. 30, 32 (1882) (creating \na bipartisan, five-member board to govern the Territory of Utah).  \n15 See 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (National Labor Relations Board); 30 U.S.C. § 823(b) (Mine Safety and \nHealth Review Commission); 42 U.S.C. § 5841(e) (Nuclear Regulatory Commission); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7171(b) (Federal Energy Regulation Commission); 42 U.S.C § 7412(r)(6) (Chemical Safety and \nHazard Investigation Board); 39 U.S.C. § 502(a) (Postal Regulatory Commission); 29 U.S.C. § \n661(b) (Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission); 46 U.S.C. § 46101(b) (Federal \nMaritime Commission). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 33 of 50\noperation of government.”  CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n of Am., Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 442 (2024) \n(Kagan, J., concurring) (quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 \nU.S. 654, 683 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.) (practice of Congressional acquiescence to President settling \nclaims against foreign nations by executive agreement supported President’s power to do so); \nStuart v. Laird, 5 U.S. 299, 309 (1803) (upholding the assignment of Supreme Court Justices to sit \nas circuit judges because “practice and acquiescence under it for a period of several years, \ncommencing with the organization of the judicial system, affords an irresistible answer, and has \nindeed fixed the construction”).   \nIn contrast, ruling for Defendants in this case would have sweeping practical ramifications.  \nInvalidating Harris’s tenure protections would mean invalidating tenure protections for every \nmultimember board.  Stare decisis principles strongly counsel against this extraordinary upheaval.  \nIndeed, even the government recognizes that it would be catastrophic for the American economy \nto strip at least one board—the Federal Reserve Board—of its independence.  Earlier this week, \nthe President issued an executive order requiring all “independent agencies” to submit “significant \nregulatory actions” for the President’s approval.  See Exec. Order No. 14,215 (2025) (Ensuring \nAccountability for All Agencies).  That order is predicated on the same argument Defendants have \nadvanced here, i.e., that all executive branch personnel must be subject to “the President’s ongoing \nsupervision and control.”  Id.  But with no explication whatsoever, the executive order specifically \ncarves out an exception for “the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System” and “the \nFederal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.”  Id.  In short, the government \nknows it would be catastrophic to adopt the logical extensions of its own legal position. \nThe potential upheaval would not stop there.  In its opposition to the temporary restraining \norder, the government paid lip service to the long historical tradition of Congress regulating the \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 34 of 50\nremoval of inferior officers and federal employees.  See, e.g., Defs. TRO Resp. at 6.  It is difficult \nto square that longstanding practice, however, with Defendants’ ahistoric and inflexible notion of \nthe President’s removal power.  If it is unconstitutional for Congress to ever protect from removal \na board member who exercises “any executive power” to any degree, there is no plausible basis to \ndistinguish the whole gamut of federal employees who exercise varying degrees of executive \npower.  Defs. TRO Resp. at 7 (emphasis original, quotation marks omitted).    \nFinally, there is an important, additional separation of powers concern if a court were to \npull the rug from Congress and invalidate tenure provisions.  For a century, Congress passed laws \nestablishing boards and appropriating funds to hire millions of federal employees on the assurance \nthat the President would not be a king, and that the merits based civil service could not become a \nspoils system.  Congress may have—indeed, likely would have—chosen to not pass a significant \nportion of that legislation had it known a single person could so dramatically reshape the landscape \nof federal employment and aggrandize huge amounts of power.  Instead, Congress may have \nlodged certain entities (like the Merit Systems Protection Board) in another branch, see Wiener, \n357 U.S. at 355; may have passed far more rigorous (and from the executive’s perspective, more \nintrusive) laws regarding civil servants’ rights; and may have radically scaled back the executive’s \nauthority altogether.  If the judiciary changes the rules on Congress now, and overturns Humphrey’s \nExecutor, it will radically upset the balance of power in a single, undemocratic stroke.16   \nD.  The Government’s Arguments On The Merits Are Wrong. \nAt the TRO stage, the government advanced a handful of arguments to distinguish this case \nfrom Humphrey’s Executor on the merits.  None hold water. \n \n16 Because the Constitution makes legislation difficult to pass, including because it is subject to \nPresidential veto, it is no answer to suggest that Congress could now pass legislation to pare back \nthe President’s sudden accumulation of power.      \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 35 of 50\nFirst, the government formalistically argued that if a multimember board exercises any \ndegree of executive authority, the Board falls outside of the Humphrey’s Executor framework.  \nAccording  to  the  government,  Humphrey’s  Executor  mischaracterized  the  Federal  Trade \nCommission as exercising quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power in an Article I and III sense; \nmodern courts understand that entities like the Merit Systems Protection Board actually exercise a \ndegree of Article II executive authority; and so this case is distinguishable from Humphrey’s \nExecutor on that technical basis.          \nThe Supreme Court has already rejected that reading of Humphrey’s Executor and the \nargument that if someone exercises a mere scintilla of executive power, she must be removable at \nwill by the President.  In Morrison, the Court acknowledged that under modern precedent, “the \npowers of the” Federal Trade Commission “at the time of Humphrey’s Executor would at the \npresent time be considered ‘executive,’ at least to some degree.”  487 U.S. at 689 n.28.  But the \nCourt explained its use of the terms quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial in Humphrey’s Executor \nwas not meant “to define rigid categories of those officials who may or may not be removed at \nwill by the President.”  Id. at 689.  Instead, the terms quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial help \ndescribe the circumstances in which Congress might be more inclined to find that \na degree of independence from the Executive, such as that afforded by a “good \ncause” removal standard, is necessary to the proper functioning of the agency or \nofficial.  It is not difficult to imagine situations in which Congress might desire that \nan official performing “quasi-judicial” functions, for example, would be free of \nexecutive or political control. \nId. at 691 n.30.  \nThe government’s invocation of Seila Law on this point (at 9) is particularly off base.  Far \nfrom describing Humphrey’s Executor as holding that a “multimember body” cannot “exercise any \nexecutive power,” Defs. TRO Resp. at 9 (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 198, but emphasis added \nby the government), Seila Law explained that “multimember expert agencies that do not wield \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 36 of 50\nsubstantial executive power” may receive for-cause removal protections under the Humphrey’s \nExecutor framework, Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218 (emphasis added).  And because the Merit \nSystems Protection Board does not exercise substantial executive power, the for-cause removal \nprovision at issue in this case is constitutional.    \nSecond, the government attempted to distinguish the Merit Systems Protection Board \n“from a purely adjudicative body” like the War Claims Commission in Wiener based on several \nfactors.  Defs. TRO Op. at 7.  Its arguments only underscore why the Board does not wield \nsubstantial executive authority and why the Board is a true adjudicatory body like the War Claims \nCommission.   \nFor example, the government complained that the Board “hears” and “adjudicates” matters \nand, subject to the appeals process, takes “final action.”  Id. (brackets omitted, quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(a)(1)).  But the whole point of an adjudicatory body is to hear and adjudicate matters.  \nMoreover, the War Claims Commission, which the government appears to acknowledge was \nconstitutional, could exercise far more authority than the Board.  As the Supreme Court explained \nin Wiener, the Commission’s “finality of determination” was  \nnot subject to review by any other official of the United States or by any court by \nmandamus or otherwise.  Awards were to be paid out of a War Claims Fund in the \nhands of the Secretary of the Treasury, whereby such claims were given even more \nassured collectability than adheres to judgments rendered in the Court of Claims. \n \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 354-355 (internal citation omitted, emphasis added).  In contrast, the Board’s \ndecisions are subject to appellate review in Article III courts.   \n  The government likewise complains the Board has the authority to review Office of \nPersonnel Management rules to ensure they do not violate prohibitions against certain employment \npractices, such as coercing employees into engaging in political activity.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(f), \n2302(b)(3).  That too is hardly the exercise of “substantial executive power,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 37 of 50\nat 218, particularly because the Director of Office of Personnel Management may seek an Article \nIII court’s intervention where the President disagrees with the Board.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703(d).  \nFinally, the government points to the fact that the Board is “the named respondent” in some cases \nand can litigate the matter in the Courts of Appeals.  This happens when the Board resolves a \nmatter on procedural grounds, or if the government contests a Board decision.  Defs. TRO Op. at \n7.  That is not “substantial executive power,” either.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218 (emphasis added).  \nIt is a minor aspect of the Board’s function that ensures the Board may (1) have its experts handle \ncomplex procedural appeals, and (2) inform the Court of its views when the Director petitions a \nCourt of Appeals for review.17     \n  Third, the government argued (at 9) that, under Collins, a court may not ever weigh the \nsubstantiality of the executive power a multimember body possesses when determining whether a \nfor-cause removal provision is constitutional.  But that is not what the Court said in Collins.  \nInstead,  the  Court  stressed  that  Collins  was  a  “straightforward  application  of”  the  Court’s \n“reasoning in Seila Law,” and that its holding is limited to “an agency led by a single Director.”  \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 251.  In fact, Collins reiterated that Seila Law had not “revisit[ed]” “prior \ndecisions allowing certain limitations on the President’s removal power,” but instead declined to \nextend Humphrey’s Executor in a “novel context” involving a single director.  Id. (quoting Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 204).  And Seila Law is crystal clear:  For “multimember expert agencies,” the \nquestion is whether they “wield substantial executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.    \n \n17 Even if the Court thinks Congress crossed over the line and granted the Board some authority \nthat counts as substantial executive power (it did not), the appropriate remedy would not be to \ninvalidate the tenure provision.  Instead, in an appropriate case challenging a specific authority as \nbeyond what a multimember body may exercise, should one ever arise, a court could invalidate \nthat offending exercise of authority. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 38 of 50\nII.  This Court Should Provide The Full Relief Harris Seeks. \nMoving from merits to remedy, this Court should award the full measure of relief Plaintiff \nseeks, as well as any other remedy the Court deems appropriate.  The open-and-shut nature of the \nmerits case underscores why meaningful and effective relief is so critical.  \nA.  Plaintiff is entitled to declaratory relief.  There are “ ‘no dispositive factors’ ” for when \ndeclaratory judgment should issue, but courts typically rely on “two criteria” when determining \nwhether to issue declaratory relief: (1) whether the judgment will “clarify[] the legal relations at \nissue” and (2) whether it will “afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving \nrise to the proceeding.”  New York v. Biden, 636 F. Supp. 3d 1, 31 (D.D.C. 2022) (quoting Glenn \nv. Thomas Fortune Fay, 222 F. Supp. 3d 31, 36 (D.D.C. 2016)).   \nBoth factors warrant declaratory relief here.  There is no question that a judgment would \nsettle a “substantial controversy” as to the parties’ relations—namely whether Plaintiff remains a \nduly appointed member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.  See Glenn, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 36.  \nDeclaratory relief would similarly remove the uncertainty at the heart of this case:  Whether Harris \ncan  be  removed  from  her  position  on  the  Board  absent  “inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.”  5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).   \nNor would any of the typical concerns that might weigh against declaratory relief apply.  \nThere are no questions about the “equity” of Harris’s conduct; the “state of the record” is fully \ndeveloped as to all facts relevant to the legal issue before this Court; the parties are plainly \n“adverse[]”; and, as this Court has already recognized, the “question to be decided” is one of \nsubstantial “public importance.”  POM Wonderful LLC v. F.T.C., 894 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (D.D.C. \n2012)  (noting  several  “useful  considerations”  found  by  the  D.C.  Circuit); TRO  Op.  at  20 \n(discussing the “substantial public interest” in this case).   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 39 of 50\nB.  Plaintiff also satisfies the requirements for a permanent injunction.18  Plaintiff (1) will \nsuffer irreparable injury if an injunction is denied; (2) remedies “available at law” cannot remedy \nthat injury; and (3) the balance of hardships and public interest favor Plaintiff.  See eBay Inc., 547 \nU.S. at 391.  Where, as here, the “enforce[ment] of federal law” hangs in the balance, courts “must \nnot hesitate in awarding necessary relief.”  Ramirez v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 568 F. Supp. \n3d 10, 22 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting DL v. District of Columbia, 860 F.3d 713, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2017)).  \nAll the reasons this Court presented why this case is a “genuinely extraordinary situation” \nwarranting such relief apply with even greater force at this stage.  See TRO Op. at 12-14. \nFirst, the harms at issue here are irreparable and “sufficient in kind and degree” to override \nthe factors typically weighing against relief in “personnel cases.”  See Sampson v. Murray, 415 \nU.S. 61, 84 (1974).   \nMost  importantly,  Defendants’  actions  cause  irreparable  harm  to  the  Board  itself.19  \nDefendants seek to deprive Plaintiff “of the ability to do what Congress specifically directed,” i.e., \nto serve as an independent member of the Board.  TRO Op. at 15 (quoting Dellinger v. Bessent, \nNo. 25-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at *11 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025)).  Plaintiff’s “statutory mission” is \ncore to the Board’s independence.  Denying a merits-stage injunction would not just “threaten[] \nthe independence” of the Board, it would destroy its independence entirely by suggesting that the \nco-equal branches lack any ability to counteract the plainly illegal removal of Board members for \ncause.  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 630; see also Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL \n \n18 For the same reasons discussed here and for the reasons outlined in the Court’s TRO opinion, \nPlaintiff also satisfies the standard for a preliminary injunction.  Should the Court not issue its \nmerits decision before the TRO dissolves, Plaintiff requests a preliminary injunction on or before \nthe dissolution of the TRO.    \n19 This Court correctly observed (TRO Op. at 15) that the “interests of [a plaintiff’s agency]” is a \npermissible factor to consider in awarding equitable relief.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 40 of 50\n538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983) (explaining that irreparable injury is “evident by the obviously \ndisruptive effect the denial of preliminary relief will likely have on [an independent] Commission’s \nfinal activities”).  More narrowly, Plaintiff would also be deprived of her “ ‘statutory right to \nfunction’ ” as a board member, which is a separate harm based on Plaintiff’s inability to fulfill her \nseven-year term.  See TRO Op. at 17.  These are the quintessential types of harm that “cannot be \nremedied with anything other than equitable relief.”  Id.; accord TRO Op. at 15.20 \nSecond, the nature of the irreparable harm makes plain why legal remedies are inadequate.  \nPlaintiff’s “loss of the ability” to perform her congressionally directed, presidentially appointed, \nand Senate confirmed mission transcends the “loss of income” or “embarrassment” involved in the \ntypical employment action; and it cannot be restored by an award of damages.  Dellinger, 2025 \nWL 471022, at *10-11; TRO Op. at 18.  The government’s argument in its TRO briefing that \nbackpay is the only appropriate remedy, Defs’ TRO Resp. at 10, is unavailing.  As an initial matter, \nthe mere availability of other equitable relief does not render injunctive relief improper.  See Brown \nv. Alabama Dep’t of Transp., 597 F.3d 1160, 1184 (11th Cir. 2010) (explaining that back pay “is \nconsidered equitable relief”).  In any event, no amount of money paid to Plaintiff will reanimate \nthe Board’s independence once it is eviscerated or replace her lost time in office. \nThird, as at the TRO stage, the balance of the equities and public interest favor Plaintiff.  \nThere is an extremely strong interest in the executive branch “abid[ing] by the federal laws that \ngovern [its] existence and operations.”  TRO Op. at 20 (quoting League of Women Voters of United \n \n20 In addition, member Raymond Limon’s term will expire on March 1, 2025.  Declining to issue \ninjunctive relief would potentially deprive the Board of a quorum and prevent it from deciding \ncases.  The government may suggest that this harm is lessened by the possibility that Limon \nchooses to hold over for an additional year.  But it is entirely speculative that Limon will choose \nto extend his term by a year, or that the President will not attempt to fire him if Limon does extend.  \nRegardless, what is a fact is that Limon’s term expires on March 1, 2025, and absent some further \ndevelopment, the Board will lack a quorum if Harris is not acting as a member.   \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 41 of 50\nStates v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)).  In its stay papers, the government asserted a \ncountervailing harm based on the purported “intrusion” of an injunction on the President’s Article \nII prerogative.  Stay Mot. at 2, ECF No. 16.  But that is just an attempt by the government to “tie \ntheir argument to the merits.”  Dellinger, 2024 WL 471022 at *13.  This Court should reject that \nsleight of hand.  If Congress could permissibly grant for-cause removal protections to members of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board, then there has been no intrusion on the President’s Article II \npowers.  The Government has no interest in doing what the law forbids.  League of Women Voters, \n838 F.3d at 12 (“There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency \naction.”).  Permanent injunctive relief is therefore proper.21  \nC.  In its TRO filings and in Dellinger, the Government has suggested that it would be \ninappropriate to provide injunctive relief in this case due to separation of powers concerns.  But \nthose arguments are all wrong.   \n1.  The government relies on a separation-of-powers argument grounded in the norm \nagainst  “enjoin[ing]  the  President  in  the  performance  of  his  official  duties.”    Franklin  v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (plurality) (quoting Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, \n501 (1867)); Defs’ TRO Resp. at 10; Gov’t Stay App. (“Dellinger App.”) at 21-22, Bessent v. \nDellinger, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 16, 2025).  But the government fundamentally misreads \nprecedent.  The norm against issuing injunctive relief against the President as an individual reflects \na unique concern that injunctive relief that runs “against the President personally” would “distract \nhim from his constitutional responsibilit[ies].”  Id. at 828 (Scalia, J. concurring in part and \n \n21 For the additional reasons discussed below, to the extent permanent injunctive relief is not \navailable, Plaintiff is also entitled to mandamus.  See Compl., ECF No. 1 at 16 (requesting \nmandamus relief in Count Five). \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 42 of 50\nconcurring in the judgment).22  That norm has never been held to prevent suits against lesser \nexecutive officials, which do not “invoke separation-of-powers considerations to the same extent,” \nand which ensure relief to the plaintiff.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 811 n.17 (1982).  As \nto those executive officials, “injunctive relief” is firmly “within the courts’ power,” Franklin, 505 \nU.S. at 802, and consistent with “a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, \ntracing back to England.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015).  \nNor is it uncommon for plaintiffs to include the President as a named party, but for the relief to run \nagainst his subordinates.  See Hawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 788 (9th Cir. 2017) (maintaining the \nPresident as a defendant but tailoring “injunctive relief” to the other “remaining Defendants”), \nvacated on other grounds, 583 U.S. 941 (2017).23   \nIndeed, the D.C. Circuit has rejected this precise argument.  As the Court explained, the \nfact that challenged action “is essentially that of the President does not insulate the entire executive \nbranch from judicial review.”  Chamber of Com. Of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. \n1996).  Rather, it is “well established” that plaintiffs can obtain full review by “seeking to enjoin \nthe officers who attempt to enforce the President’s directive” “[e]ven if [they] were acting at the \nbehest of the President.”  Id. (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 815 (Scalia, J. concurring)).  The D.C. \n \n22 Even Franklin “did not absolutely slam the door shut on presidential injunctions”—rather, both \nthe plurality and Justice Scalia left open the possibility that the President “might be subject to a \njudicial injunction requiring the performance of a purely ‘ministerial’ duty.”  McCray v. Biden, 574 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802; id. at 827 n.2 (Scalia, J. \nconcurring)).  \n23 To avoid any doubt, the Court may wish to make clear that all injunctive relief (temporary, \npreliminary, or permanent) applies only “to the other defendants acting on [the President’s] \nbehalf.”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025). \nThe D.C. Circuit has held that courts “may utilize the tool of declaratory relief” against the \nPresident as a defendant.  Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. \n1974).  But to similarly avoid the government recycling its argument about whether the President \nis a proper defendant for declaratory relief, the Court may wish to issue declaratory relief solely \nagainst the other Defendants. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 43 of 50\nCircuit recently reaffirmed this point in Dellinger, explaining that such relief is “unquestionably” \navailable in removal cases.  Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1. \nThe government’s position also proves too much.  Taken to its logical conclusion, the \ngovernment would prohibit relief against any official that can be said to exercise Article II power, \nincluding any time the President orders someone to act under his prerogative to “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.”  Dellinger App. at 12.  Indeed, if the government is correct, the \nPresident could always avoid judicial review by asserting that the acts of his officials constitute \nthe use of “executive power on his behalf.”  Id.  That cannot be right.  Our federal system of checks \nand balances relies on the ability of the judiciary to “determine if the executive branch is abiding \nby the terms of legislative enactments,” Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1996), and \n“to say what the law is,” Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177.  That core aspect of the separation of powers—\nand indeed the “rule of law”—could effectively be “bypassed” were courts unable to issue \n“injunctive relief against subordinate officials” in those circumstances.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 978. \n2.  The government also argued that injunctive relief would amount to improper “judicial \nreinstatement.”  Defs’ TRO Resp. at 10.  This argument conflates the merits and remedies analysis.  \nWhether Plaintiff must be reinstated, or whether she currently is a legally appointed Board \nmember, “is the very merits issue” that must be “adjudicated by [this] [C]ourt.”  Dellinger, 2025 \nWL 559669, at *6.  To entertain the government’s argument, this Court would have to presume \nthat the for-cause removal protection itself is unconstitutional—“the opposite of what courts \nnormally do.”  Id.  If this Court follows the normal course and concludes that “the statute is \nconstitutional and binding,” see id., only one conclusion is available: that Plaintiff is and always \nhas been a duly appointed member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.  See also Wilkinson v. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 44 of 50\nLegal Servs. Corp., 27 F. Supp. 2d 32, 64 (D.D.C. 1998) (explaining that courts only “reach the \nquestion of . . . remedy” if a plaintiff “prevail[s]” on her claim).   \nInjunctive relief, therefore, would simply prevent Cathy Harris from being “removed from \nher office” or “in any way be[ing] treated as having been removed.”  Compl. at 11-12.  It would \nnot require “reinstatement” or otherwise coerce executive officials in a way different from the mine \nrun of cases enjoining ultra vires executive acts.  See, e.g., Reich, 74 F.3d at 67 (explaining that \n“courts are normally available” when the executive “acts ultra vires”).  In short, the Government’s \nobjection only makes sense if Plaintiff’s removal was lawful in the first place—the very inquiry \non the merits.  The Court should reject this end run around the typical permanent injunction inquiry.  \n3.  The government in Dellinger also advanced a highly technical argument that only legal \nrelief is available in these circumstances, citing a statement from an 1898 case that that courts of \nequity traditionally lacked jurisdiction over “the appointment and removal of public officers.”  \nDellinger App. at 24 (quoting, inter alia, White v. Berry 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898)).  But the \nSupreme Court has explained that “[m]uch water has flowed under the dam since 1898,” Sampson, \n415 U.S. at 71, including the merger of law and equity in 1938.  Since 1898, the Supreme Court \nhas expressly recognized that Article  III  courts are not “without authority to grant interim \ninjunctive relief to a discharged government employee,” despite the “historical denial” of such \nrelief “in cases such as White.”  Id. at 71, 83; see also id. at 92 n.68 (“[W]e do not wish to be \nunderstood as foreclosing [such] relief.”).  Indeed, other plaintiffs have received equitable relief in \nanalogous  contexts.    See,  e.g.,  Vitarelli  v.  Seaton,  359  U.S.  535,  540  (1959)  (holding  that \nDepartment of Interior official was illegally dismissed in violation of binding regulations and \nstating official was therefore “entitled to the reinstatement which he seeks”); Service v. Dulles, 354 \nU.S. 363, 370 (1957) (considering similar claim for declaratory and injunctive relief by illegally \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 45 of 50\ndischarged foreign service employee); Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. \nNov. 14, 1983) (granting preliminary injunction); cf. Wiener, 357 U.S. at 351 & n.* (noting that \nmember of War Claims Commission had initially filed suit to retain his office, but then switched \nto seeking back pay after “the Commission was abolished”).24 \nRegardless, even if the government were correct that the Court may not issue equitable \nrelief here (to be clear: the government is wrong), the Court should at minimum grant other relief \nPlaintiff seeks.  For one, the technical constraints that may apply to injunctive relief need not apply \nto declaratory judgments, which “are neither legal nor equitable,” Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. \nMayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 284 (1988), and need not “fit into one of the existing equitable \npatterns.”  AstenJohnson, Inc. v. Columbia Cas. Co., 562 F.3d 213, 223 (3d Cir. 2009).  In addition, \ncases the government cited in its application before the Supreme Court in Dellinger confirm that \ncourts have jurisdiction “to determine the title to a public office” by “certiorari, error, or appeal, \nor by mandamus, prohibition, [or] quo warranto.”  In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888) (cited \nat Dellinger App. 23-24).  To be clear, the fact that so many remedies have long been available in \npersonnel  cases  proves  that  no  grave  separation-of-powers  concerns  arise  from  issuing  an \ninjunction.  But in this particular case, the Complaint includes a request for mandamus relief.  \nCompl. ¶¶ 42-44.  If the Court concludes other relief is unavailable, a writ of mandamus should \nissue.  “[N]o other adequate means to attain relief” would exist; Plaintiff’s entitlement to relief is \n“clear and indisputable”; and mandamus would be “appropriate under the circumstances.”  See In \n \n24 The District Court in Service later entered an order declaring the Secretary of State’s action \n“purporting to terminate” the plaintiff to be “invalid and without legal effect” and ordering the \nplaintiff’s “restoration . . . as a foreign service officer.”  Service, B-134614 Comp. Gen., 1958 WL \n1888 (Mar. 3, 1958).  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 46 of 50\nre Al Baluchi, 952 F.3d 363, 368 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (quoting Cheney v.

Finally, as a variant of its argument that an officer may not seek equitable relief, the \ngovernment has relatedly suggested that Harris’s potential relief is limited to backpay.  Defs’ TRO \nResp. at 10.  This, too, misreads precedent.  Sampson expressly left open the possibility of \ninjunctive relief in the “extraordinary situation” where there is no other proper equitable remedy.  \nTRO Op. at 11 n.3 (citing Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n. 68).  Plaintiff is aware of no court—and the \ngovernment cites none—establishing a “per se” backpay-only rule.  Robinson v. D.C. Gov’t, No. \n97-CV-787, 1997 WL 607450, at *7 (D.D.C. July 17, 1997) (collecting cases).  As Judge Jackson \nexplained in Dellinger, the considerations that have led courts to deny injunctive relief in other \ncontexts have “little utility” as applied to officials removable only for cause.  Dellinger, 2025 WL \n471022, at *10. \nAt bottom, it makes no sense to limit relief to backpay:  The President has “naked[ly]” \nclaimed that he may “remove a member of an adjudicatory body” “merely because he wanted his \nown appointees.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 256.  But “no such power is given to the President directly \nby the Constitution.”  Id.  It cannot be that the President may unlawfully terminate a protected \nadjudicatory official like Cathy Harris, and the only minor consequence of violating the law is that \nthe Treasury must write her a check each pay period, a negligible expense from the President’s \nperspective.  Congress did not provide for-cause protection to Board members to ensure they \n \n25 To facilitate appellate review, if the Court were to grant a permanent injunction, the Court may \nstill wish to additionally note that it would alternatively grant mandamus were the option of a \npermanent injunction not available. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 47 of 50\nreceive pay upon removal.  Congress protected members from arbitrary dismissal to ensure they \nremain in office and exercise their duties, free from fear or favor.26   \n* * * \n Let’s be clear: Defendants purport to champion the separation of powers.  But at the end \nof the day, their position that this Article III Court is powerless to award meaningful relief to Cathy \nHarris and enforce landmark precedent takes direct aim at the very notion of judicial review core \nto the separation of powers.  “The government of the United States has been emphatically termed \na government of laws, and not of men.  It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if \nthe laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.”  Marbury, 5 U.S. at 163; see \nid. (“[W]here there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy” (quotation marks omitted)).  This \nCourt can and should say “no.”   \n \n26 Indeed, under the logical extent of the government’s backpay-only framework, if the President \npurported to terminate Article III judges and ordered executive branch officials to bar them from \ntheir chambers, the harmed judge would have no meaningful recourse.  That cannot be right. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 48 of 50\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris’s motion should be granted, the Court \nshould enter declaratory relief for Plaintiff, the Court should order the proposed permanent \ninjunction submitted by Plaintiff, and the Court should issue a writ of mandamus.  Plaintiff also \nrespectfully requests that the Court extend the operative TRO if it does not resolve the merits \nwithin 14 days of the TRO’s entry.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2).  Plaintiff similarly respectfully \nrequests a preliminary injunction if the TRO dissolves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 \nand the Court has not yet issued a decision on the merits.27 \n \n \n27 For analytic simplicity, Plaintiff’s complaint was divided into six overlapping counts.  She \ndeserves to prevail on the merits of counts one and four because, as we just explained in Part I, the \nalleged “termination of Ms. Harris is ultra vires,” and violates the “reasonable limitations on the \nremoval of the heads of independent agencies” established by Congress pursuant to its powers \nunder the Constitution.  Compl. ECF No. 1 at 15, 16.  She deserves to prevail on count two, under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, because, as we explained in Part I, any action taken by the \ndefendants toward her or the Board with respect to her alleged termination is not “in accordance \nwith law.”  Id. at 16 (quotation marks omitted).  She deserves to prevail on count three (declaratory \nrelief), count five (mandamus), and count six (injunction) for the reasons described above in Part \nII. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 22     Filed 02/23/25     Page 49 of 50\n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nDated: February 23, 2025  /s/ Jeremy D.

HARRIS,      \n     \n        Plaintiff,       \n   \nv.  Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00412-RC \n   \nSCOTT BESSENT, et al.,   \n   \n \n        Defendants. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \nThe Constitution vests the entirety of the “executive Power” in the President, who is given \nthe sole responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Art. II, § 1, cl. 1; id. § 3.  \nThat executive power encompasses the authority to remove those who aid the President in carrying \nout his duties.  On February 11, 2025, the President exercised this authority when he removed Plaintiff \nCathy Harris from her position as a Member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (the “Board” or \n“MSPB”), an executive branch agency that performs quintessentially executive functions.  Plaintiff \nnow challenges her removal, seeking among other relief, a temporary restraining order that would \nrequire reinstallation to her former principal office on the Board.  But because she cannot satisfy the \nrequirements necessary to obtain that extraordinary relief, the Court should deny her request. \nFirst, Plaintiff has not shown that she is likely to succeed on the merits.  The MSPB adjudicates \nemployment disputes within the executive branch, has the authority to issue binding orders, and has \nthe power to enforce compliance with those orders.  Because the MSPB wields significant executive \npower, its Members fall squarely within the President’s removal power.  For that reason, Humphrey’s \nExecutor—which carved out a narrow exception to that removal power for multimember bodies with \n“quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” functions that exercise no executive power—does not apply. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 2 of 14\nSecond, Plaintiff has not shown that she will suffer imminent irreparable harm in the absence \nof a temporary restraining order.  The loss of government employment constitutes irreparable harm \nonly in a “genuinely extraordinary situation,” Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 & n.68 (1974), and \nPlaintiff does not even attempt to argue that she meets this high bar.  Rather, she casts her claim of \nirreparable harm as a deprivation of a “statutory right to function” as a Member of the MSPB, see Pl.’s \nMot. at 10.  But she does not explain why she will suffer irreparable harm “during whatever modest \namount of time may be necessary to adjudicate an expedited motion for preliminary injunction.”  See \nOrder, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir.) (Katsas, J., concurring) (casting doubt on ability of \nremoved head of the Office of Special Counsel to show irreparable harm).  And if Plaintiff asserts \nirreparable harm to the functioning of the MSPB, that assertion is misplaced, both because the MSPB \ncan continue to function with its existing Board members and because Plaintiff would lack standing \nto raise such a harm. \nThird, the balance of the equities and the public interest favor Defendants.  The relief that \nPlaintiff seeks—an order requiring the President to reinstate a person he has chosen to remove from \noffice—is extraordinary.  And with good reason:  such an order that would greatly impede the \nPresident’s authority to exercise “all of” “the ‘executive Power’” of the United States.  Seila Law, 590 \nU.S.  at  203.    Allowing  Plaintiff  to  exercise  executive  power  over  the  President’s  objection \nunquestionably inflicts irreparable harm on both the Executive and the separation of powers. \nBecause the merits and the other temporary restraining order factors all cut against Plaintiff, \nher motion for extraordinary preliminary relief should be denied.  \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background \nCongress created the Merit Systems Protection Board (the “Board” or “MSPB”) as part of the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 (the “Act”).  Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 118–44 \n(1978).  Before that, in 1883, Congress established a Civil Service Commission, comprised of three \nPresidentially appointed Commissioners, that helped the President prepare suitable civil service rules \nfor examinations of applicants for federal employment.  Act of Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, §2, 22 Stat. 403 \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 3 of 14\n(1883).  When Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act almost a century later, it split the \nfunctions of the Civil Service Commission between two separate new agencies: the Office of \nPersonnel Management and the MSPB.  Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 Act, 92 Stat. 1111, 1118–\n44.  The Act charged OPM with conducting personnel management functions formerly performed by \nthe Civil Service Commission, while the MSPB performed the Civil Service Commission’s “hearing, \nadjudication, and appeals functions, and exercised its authority to enforce agency compliance with its \ndecisions.”  Congressional Research Service, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB): A Legal \nOverview 3 (March 25, 2019). \nThe Act provides that the Board—like the Civil Service Commission before it—shall consist \nof three Members, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  5 U.S.C. § \n1201.  No more than two Members may belong to the same political party.  Id.  The Act also provides \nthat Members can “be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office.”  Id. § 1202(d). \n The Board primarily reviews federal employee appeals of adverse actions “which [are] \nappealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation,” including those related to removal or \nsuspension for periods greater than fourteen days.  5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); see also id. § 7701(a); id. § 7521(a); \n5 C.F.R. § 1201.3(a).  Cases may be heard by the Board directly or referred to either Administrative \nLaw Judges (ALJs) or administrative judges employed by the Board.  Id. § 7701(b)(1).  The Board has \nthe authority to “take final action on any such matter[s]” before it.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1).  It can then \norder any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board . . . \nand enforce compliance with any such order.”  Id. § 1204(a)(2).   \nThe Board also has independent litigating authority to send its own attorneys (not Department \nof Justice attorneys) to litigate civil actions outside the Supreme Court in connection with any of its \nfunctions.  Id. § 1204(i).  And under certain circumstances, the Board itself is the named respondent \n(and thus a litigant) in judicial proceedings seeking review of Board decisions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703(a)(2).  \nIt can also review rules of the Office of Personnel Management, another executive agency.  Id. \n§ 1204(a)(3).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 4 of 14\nII.  The Present Controversy \nPlaintiff was first nominated by President Biden to serve as a Member of the MSPB on June \n24, 2021.  Compl. ¶ 24.  She was renominated on January 4, 2022.  Id.  The Senate confirmed her on \nMay 25, 2022, and she was sworn in as a Member of the Board on June 1, 2022.  Id.  She was sworn \nin as Chairman of the Board on March 14, 2024.  Id. ¶ 25. \nOn February 11, 2025, the Deputy Assistant to the President and the Deputy Director of the \nWhite House Presidential Personnel Office informed Plaintiff that she was being removed from her \nposition.  Compl. ¶ 26.  That same day, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit, see generally Compl., and moved for \na temporary restraining order, requesting that she be reinstated.  See ECF No. 2-4.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nPlaintiff seeks a temporary restraining order—“an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of \nright.” Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  To obtain such extraordinary relief, a plaintiff “must \nshow (1) ‘[she] is likely to succeed on the merits,’ (2) ‘[she] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief,’ (3) ‘the balance of equities tips in [her] favor,’ and (4) issuing ‘an \ninjunction is in the public interest.’”  Hanson v. District of Columbia, 120 F.4th 223, 231 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20); see also Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Bus. Admin., 646 F. Supp. 3d 101, \n109 (D.D.C. 2022) (“The decision of whether to award a TRO is analyzed using the same factors \napplicable to preliminary injunctive relief[.]” (cleaned up)).  When “the Government is the opposing \nparty,” the assessment of “harm to the opposing party” and “the public interest” merge.  Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nPlaintiff must do more than merely show the possibility of prevailing on the merits, but rather \nmust show “a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.”  Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 \nF.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Plaintiff also must establish irreparable harm, as failure do so \nconstitutes “grounds for refusing to issue [preliminary relief], even if the other three factors entering \nthe calculus merit such relief.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. \n2006); accord Wright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2948.1 (3d ed.) (irreparable harm is “the \nsingle most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction” as “[o]nly when the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 5 of 14\nthreatened harm would impair the court’s ability to grant an effective remedy is there really a need for \npreliminary relief”). \nMandatory injunctions that “would change the status quo” are disfavored as “an even more \nextraordinary remedy” than the typical preliminary injunction, “especially when directed at the United \nStates Government.”  Kondapally v. USCIS, No. CV 20-00920 (BAH), 2020 WL 5061735, at *3 (D.D.C. \nAug. 27, 2020) (citations omitted); see also Mylan Pharms., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 36 (D.D.C. \n2000) (“In this Circuit, ‘the power to issue a preliminary injunction, especially a mandatory one, should \nbe sparingly exercised.’” (quoting Dorfmann v. Boozer, 414 F.2d 1168, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1969))).  “Plaintiffs \nseeking this type of relief . . . face ‘an additional hurdle’ when proving their entitlement to relief,” and \ncourts “exercise extreme caution in assessing” such motions.  Kondapally, 2020 WL 5061735, at *3.  \n“As a rule, when a mandatory preliminary injunction is requested, the district court should deny such \nrelief unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.”  Id. (cleaned up). \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiff fails to satisfy any of the factors necessary for the extraordinary remedy she seeks—\na mandatory temporary restraining order compelling Defendants, including the President, to reinstate \nher to a position from which she has been removed.  Such an order would be unprecedented and \nunwarranted, and should be rejected. \nI.  Plaintiff Cannot Succeed On The Merits \nPlaintiff alleges that the President did not validly remove her from office because members of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board may be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.”  Compl. at 3, 5 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 1201).  But Board members are principal \nofficers who lead a freestanding component within the executive branch and exercise executive power.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 6 of 14\nAccordingly, because the entirety of the executive power is vested in the President, see Art. II, § 1, cl. \n1, the President must be able to remove Board members at will. \nA.  At-Will Removal is the General Rule, and MSPB Does Not Fit Within Any \nExceptions.  \n 1.  The Constitution vests the entirety of the “executive Power” in the President, who is given \nthe sole responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Art. II, § 1, cl. 1; id. § 3; see \nalso Severino v. Biden, 71 F. 4th 1038, 1043–44 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  “[A]s a general matter,” the executive \npower encompasses “the authority to remove those who assist [the President] in carrying out his \nduties.”  Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 513–14 (2010).  Without such \npower, the President would be unable to control those who aid him in executing the laws and “could \nnot be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities.”  Id. at 514.     \nFor nearly a century, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed “the President’s power to \nremove—and thus supervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf.”  Seila L. LLC v. \nConsumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 204 (2020) (citing Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)).  \nThe Supreme Court has recognized “only two exceptions to the President’s unrestricted removal \npower.”  Id.  First, in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Supreme Court held \nthat Congress could impose for-cause removal restrictions on “a multimember body of experts, \nbalanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and judicial functions and was said not to \nexercise any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.  Second, in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 64 \n(1988), and United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886), the Court recognized an exception “for inferior \nofficers with limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n218.  Those exceptions represent the “outermost constitutional limits of permissible restrictions on \nthe President’s removal power” under current precedent.  Id. (quoting PHH Corp. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. \nBureau, 881 F.3d 75, 196 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting)).   \n2.  Members of the MSPB do not fit within either of these exceptions.  They are not inferior \nofficers with narrowly defined duties; to the contrary, they are principal officers appointed by the \nPresident with Senate confirmation, see U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2; 5 U.S.C. § 1201, oversee their own \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 7 of 14\ndepartment, and are not subservient to any other principal officer, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204.  See also Free \nEnterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 511 (explaining that a department “is a freestanding component of the \nExecutive Branch, not subordinate to or contained within any other such component”).  Nor does \nthe Humphrey’s Executor exception apply.  Nor does the Humphrey’s Executor exception apply.  As the \nSupreme Court made clear in Seila Law, that exception is limited to “multimember bodies with ‘quasi-\njudicial’ or ‘quasi-legislative’ functions” that do not exercise “any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 216–17 (quoting Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632) (emphasis added).  That narrow \nexception does not encompass the MSPB.  \nThe MSPB is no “mere legislative or judicial aid,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 199.  It is an \nindependent agency that performs many executive functions.  For instance, the MSPB has the \nauthority to “order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by \nthe Board … and enforce compliance with any such order,” 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2); see also Seila Law, \n591 U.S. 197 at 219 (explaining that the CFPB Director exercises executive power because he “may \nunilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal and equitable relief in administrative adjudications.”).  \nIt also “hear[s], adjudicate[s], or provide[s] for the hearing or adjudication” of matters within its \njurisdiction and, “subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take[s] final action on any such \nmatter.”  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1).  The MSPB can review rules of the Office of Personnel Management, \nanother executive agency, id. § 1204(f).  It has independent litigating authority to send its own attorneys \n(not Department of Justice attorneys) to litigate civil actions outside the Supreme Court in connection \nwith any of its functions.  Id. § 1204(i); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138–40 (recognizing \ninterpreting  and  enforcing  law  through  litigation  as  executive  function).    And  under  certain \ncircumstances, the Board itself is the named respondent (and thus a litigant) in judicial proceedings \nseeking review of Board decisions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703(a)(2).  These features distinguish the Board \nfrom a purely adjudicatory body.  Contra Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958) (upholding \nremoval restriction on member of purely adjudicatory body).  \nIn short, the MSPB wields executive power and must be accountable to the President through \nthe removal power.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204 (“The President’s power to remove—and thus \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 8 of 14\nsupervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf follows from the text of Article II[.]”). \n3.  Plaintiff’s contrary contention rests largely on an overbroad reading of Humphrey’s Executor \nand Wiener.  Plaintiff seeks to stretch them beyond their facts to reach a Board that exercises substantial \nexecutive power.  The Supreme Court in Seila Law made clear, however, that neither Humphrey’s \nExecutor nor Wiener extends so far.  After Seila Law, “only a very narrow reading of those cases is still \ngood law” and there is “little to nothing is left of the Humphrey’s exception to the general rule that the \nPresident may freely remove his subordinates.”  Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1050 (D.C. Cir. 2023) \n(Walker, J., concurring).1     \nIn  Humphrey’s  Executor,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  the  constitutionality  of  a  provision \nprohibiting  removal  of  Federal  Trade  Commissioners  absent  “inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.”  265 U.S. at 632.  Despite reaffirming Myers’s then-recent holding that the \nPresident “has unrestrictable power … to remove purely executive officers,” id. at 632, Humphrey’s \nExecutor concluded that Myers did not control because the FTC Commissioner at issue was “an officer \nwho occupies no place in the executive department and who exercises no part of the executive power \nvested by the Constitution in the President,” id. at 628.  Instead, Humphrey’s Executor understood the \nFTC to be “an administrative body” that “carr[ied] into effect legislative policies” and “perform[ed] \nother specified duties as a legislative or judicial aid.”  Id.  Those duties, according to the Court, “c[ould \n] not in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive.”  Id.  The Court \nunderstood the FTC not to be exercising executive power at all but rather to “act[] in part quasi \nlegislatively and in part quasi judicially.”  Id.  On that understanding, Humphrey’s Executor found no \nconstitutional problem with restricting the removal of FTC Commissioners.  \nBut Humphrey’s Executor rested on a fiction, and its reasoning has since been “repudiated” by \nthe Supreme Court.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 239 (Thomas, J., concurring in part).  As early as Morrison, \n \n1 While the government acknowledges that whatever little remains of Humphrey’s Executor is binding \non this Court until overturned by the Supreme Court, see Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, \n136 (2023), it preserves the argument that Humphrey’s Executor was wrongly decided. See, e.g., Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 239–51 (Thomas and Gorsuch, JJ., concurring in part) (advocating for the Court to \n“reconsider Humphrey’s Executor in toto”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 9 of 14\nthe  Supreme  Court  retreated  from  Humphrey’s  Executor’s  “quasi-legislative”  or  “quasi-judicial” \nrationale, noting that “it is hard to dispute that the powers of the FTC at the time of Humphrey’s \nExecutor would at the present time be considered ‘executive,’ at least to some degree.”  487 U.S. at 690 \nn.28, 691; see also Kuretski v. C.I.R., 755 F.3d 929, 939–45 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that the Tax Court \nexercises  executive,  not  judicial,  power).    And  Seila  Law  observed  that  Humphrey’s  Executor’s \n“conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive power has not withstood the test of time.”  591 \nU.S. at 216 n.2; see also Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 n.4 (2013) (noting that agencies may engage \nin activities that “take ‘legislative’ and ‘judicial’ forms, but [those activities] are exercises of—indeed, \nunder our constitutional structure they must be exercises of—the ‘executive Power’”).    \nPlaintiff’s insistence that the MSPB performs adjudicatory functions, has a limited ambit, and \nreports to Congress, Pl.’s Mot. at 8–9, is thus beside the point.  The Board exercises executive authority \nand is therefore not comparable to the FTC as understood by the Supreme Court in Humphrey’s \nExecutor.  See Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 627 (describing FTC Commissioner as officer “who \nexercises no part of the executive power”).  As Seila Law made clear, the Humphrey’s Executor exception \napplies only to a multimember body that “was said not to exercise any executive power,” Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 198, which cannot be said of the MSPB.    \nPlaintiff’s policy arguments about the supposed “unique” “need for independence” at the \nMSPB, Pl.’s Mot. at 9–10, do not move the needle.   Similar arguments were made and rejected in Seila \nLaw itself.  Cf. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring in part) (urging that Congress had \nstrong policy justifications for enacting the tenure protections for the CFPB Director that were held \ninvalid by the majority).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has since rejected that entire mode of reasoning:  \nin Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), the Court refused to entertain arguments about whether the \nfunctions of certain executive agencies were relatively less significant than others.  The Court explained \nthat “[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the relative importance of the regulatory and enforcement \nauthority of disparate agencies” and that “the constitutionality of removal restrictions” does not \n“hinge[] on such an inquiry.”  Collins, 594 U.S. at 253.  Because the MSPB exercises executive power, \nit does not fall within the narrow Humphrey’s Executor exception.  Board members must therefore be \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 10 of 14\nremovable at will by the President.   \nSimilarly, the fact that the MSPB may be accountable in other ways, Pl.’s Mot. at 10, cannot \ncompensate for the President’s inability to control the Board members through removal.  See Free \nEnterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 504 (noting “[b]road power” over the functions of the inferior officers at \nissue there “is not equivalent to the power to remove Board members”). \nB.  Plaintiff cannot show entitlement to reinstatement.  \nPlaintiff is also deeply mistaken in seeking judicial reinstatement to a principal office.2  When \nprincipal officers have been removed from their posts, they generally have challenged that removal in \nsuits for back pay. See Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (challenge sought “to recover a sum of \nmoney alleged to be due”); Myers, 272 U.S. at 106 (same); Wiener, 357 U.S. at 349–51(same).  The \nPresident cannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal officer whom the President no \nlonger believes should be entrusted with the exercise of executive power.  Such a remedy would raise \ngrave separation-of-powers concerns and undermine the objective of electoral accountability within \nthe Executive Branch that animated the holdings in Free Enterprise Fund and Seila Law. \n \nII.  Plaintiff Fails To Identify Any Irreparable Harm \n The “high standard for irreparable injury”—even higher here insofar as Plaintiff requests a \nmandatory injunction that would alter the status quo, Phillip v. Fairfield Univ., 118 F.3d 131, 133 (2d \nCir. 1997)—requires a two-fold showing by Plaintiff: First, because an irreparable injury “must be \nboth certain and great,” Plaintiff “must show ‘the injury complained of is of such imminence that \nthere is a “clear and present” need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.’” Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297 (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  \nAnd second, “the injury must be beyond remediation.” Id. \nPlaintiff has failed to meet her burden for either of the two required showings.  She principally \n \n2 Plaintiff contends that she “asks only that the Court preserve the status quo,” Pl.’s Mot. at 12, but \nshe is, in fact, seeking functional reinstatement to her office.  While she appears to believe she has \nnot yet been removed from office, see, e.g., Pl. Mot at 2 (requesting injunction to prevent defendants \n“from removing Ms. Harris from her office or in any way treating her as having been removed”), \nshe was informed of her removal on February 10, 2025, “effective immediately.”  Pl.’s Mot, Ex. A.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 11 of 14\ncontends that her ongoing harm stems from the deprivation “of her statutory entitlement to serve as \na Member of the MSPB.”  Pl.’s Mot. at 10–11.  But Plaintiff cites no injury of a kind that the Supreme \nCourt has recognized as irreparable in this context.  See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & n.68 (holding loss \nof income, face, and reputation do not amount to irreparable harm).  Indeed, court after court in this \nCircuit and others has concluded that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable harm.  See, \ne.g., Hetreed v. Allstate Ins. Co., 135 F.3d 1155, 1158 (7th Cir. 1998); Davis v. Billington, 76 F. Supp. 3d 59, \n65–66 (D.D.C. 2014) (collecting cases); Farris v. Rice, 453 F. Supp. 2d 76, 79–80 (D.D.C. 2006) (“cases \nare legion holding that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable injury”).  And to the extent \nthat Plaintiff attempts to distinguish her case from a “garden-variety employment dispute,” Pl.’s Mot. \nat 11, courts have repeatedly rejected the notion that the deprivation of a unique, singular, or high-\nlevel position is any more of an irreparable injury.  See Hetreed, 135 F.3d at 1158 (loss of position as \nsenior manager leading audit department not irreparable injury); Marxe v. Jackson, 833 F.2d 1121, 1122 \n(3d Cir. 1987) (division manager); Rubino v. City of Mount Vernon, 707 F.2d 53 (2d Cir. 1983) (mayoral-\nappointed City Assessor); Franks v. Nimmo, 683 F.2d 1290, 1291 (10th Cir. 1982) (Associate Chief of \nStaff for Research and Development position at Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center); \nEEOC v. City of Janesville, 630 F.2d 1254, 1256 (7th Cir. 1980) (Chief of Police); Levesque v. Maine, 587 \nF.2d 78, 79 (1st Cir. 1978) (Maine Commissioner of Manpower); Nichols v. Agency for Int’l Dev., 18 F. \nSupp. 2d 1, 2, 4 (D.D.C. 1998) (Chief of Information Management Systems, Office of Inspector \nGeneral); Burns v. GAO Emps. Fed. Credit Union, No. 88-3424, 1988 WL 134925, at *1–2 (D.D.C. Dec. \n2, 1988) (President of Credit Union Board of Directors).  \nPlaintiff also argues that the purported deprivation of her “statutory right to function” as a \nMember of the MSPB constitutes irreparable harm.  Pl.’s Mot. at 10.  She relies for this proposition \nsolely on two cases that are plainly distinguishable and that were both later vacated by the D.C. Circuit: \nBerry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. \nCir. 1983), and Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, 146 (D.D.C.), vacated sub nom. Mackie v. Clinton, 10 \nF.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \nIn Berry v. Reagan, President Reagan removed several members of the Commission on Civil \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 12 of 14\nRights, an action that left the Commission without a quorum and meant that it could not complete a \nreport it was statutorily required to complete by a date certain.  Id. at *1, *5.  But Plaintiff and MSPB \nare not similarly situated to the plaintiffs in Berry.  First, the MSPB “continues to operate” with a \nquorum, see Eric Katz, Trump fires one-third of federal employee appeals board, Government Executive (Feb. \n11,  2025,  3:38  p.m.),  https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/02/trump-fires-one-third-\nfederal-employee-appeals-board/402912/ (noting “the board will maintain its quorum”).3  See English \nv. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 335 (D.D.C. 2018) (distinguishing Berry from case in which plaintiff \nwho sought to affirm her entitlement to role as Acting Director of CFPB).  And second, like in English, \n“any such harm” to Plaintiff coming solely from her not functioning as a Member of the MSPB “can \nbe remediated in the ordinary course of this case.”  Id.  That stands in contrast to Berry, in which “any \nharm suffered by the commissioners was plainly irreparable because the commission would have \nexpired and they could not have been reinstated to it.”  Id.   \nSimilarly, in Mackie v. Bush, the President sought to remove the majority of the Board of \nGovernors of the Postal Service Board, an action that the court worried would “be irrevocably \ndisruptive of the Board’s function.”  809 F. Supp. at 146.  But the MSPB is capable of functioning \nwithout Plaintiff, since it continues to have the quorum necessary to conduct its business.  See Katz, \nsupra; 5 C.F.R. § 1200.3 (providing procedures for decisions when only two Board members present).  \nMoreover, in Mackie (a decision likewise vacated by the Court of Appeals, see 10 F.3d 13), the district \ncourt  entered  an  injunction  preventing  the  removal  of  the  governors before  their  removal  was \neffectuated, id. at 148; it did not purport to reinstate an officer who has already been removed, the far \nmore intrusive step that Plaintiff asks this Court to take here.  Mackie and Berry are thus insufficient to \n“show irreparable injury during whatever modest amount of time may be necessary to adjudicate an \nexpedited motion for preliminary injunction.”  Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir.) \n(Katsas, J., concurring) (doubting ability of removed head of Office of Special Counsel to show \n \n3 Even if the MSPB were left without a quorum, Berry would still be distinguishable.  In Berry, the harm \nwas irreparable in part because the commission was set to expire.  1983 WL 538, at *5.  But here, the \nMSPB will not cease to exist and could resume its functioning upon the resumption of a quorum.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 13 of 14\nirreparable harm in similar circumstances). \nPlaintiff’s remaining claims of irreparable harm are similarly unavailing.  Plaintiff first claims \nthat temporary restraining order is warranted because another person could be nominated and \nconfirmed such that her claim to the role will be mooted.  Pl.’s Mot. at 11.  But this is too speculative \na basis for injunctive relief.  See English, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 335 (rejecting argument that traditional \ndamages remedy or declaratory judgment would be insufficient once President nominated new \ncandidate because “it is entirely speculative how long it could take for the President to nominate and \nthe Senate to confirm a permanent CFPB Director”).  That is especially so in the context of Plaintiff’s \nrequest for a temporary restraining order, which can last at most 28 days.  Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(b)(2).   \nPlaintiff next argues that denying her preliminary relief would deprive her and the MSPB of \ntheir ability to fulfill their mandate to federal employees.   Pl.’s Mot. at 11 (citing Berry, 1983 WL 538, \nat *5).   But, as explained, unlike in Berry, the MSPB can continue to fulfill its mandate without Plaintiff, \nsince it continues to have a quorum.  And in any event, this contention simply repackages Plaintiff’s \ncontention that she is the best person for the position and that the President had no sound reason for \nremoving her—i.e., that a Board with Plaintiff as a member would better serve the agency’s mission \nthan one without her.  That is the President’s prerogative to determine. \nIII.  The Balance Of Equities and Public Interest Favor Defendants \n Granting the extraordinary relief requested would be an unprecedented intrusion into the \nPresident’s authority to exercise “all of” the “executive Power” of the United States.  Seila Law, 590 \nU.S. at 203.  Defendants are aware of only a single instance in which a federal court effectively \nreinstalled a member of a multimember agency commission who had been removed.  See Berry, 1983 \nWL 538.  That case was later vacated, see Berry v. Reagan, 732 F.2d 949, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per \ncuriam), and is distinguishable.  Part of the district court’s reasoning there was that the commission’s \n“‘only purpose’” was “‘to find facts which [could] subsequently be used as a basis for legislative or \nexecutive action,’” leading the district court to express an understanding that the Commission \nfunctioned as a “legislative agency.”  Id. at *2.  Given the MSPB’s clear exercise of executive authority, \nsee supra p. 7, there can be no misconception that the MSPB is similarly a “legislative agency.”  Because \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 6     Filed 02/13/25     Page 14 of 14\nit is instead an agency exercising executive authority, functionally reinstalling one of its principal \nofficers would work a harm to the Executive, and to the constitutional separation of powers, that is \ntransparently irreparable.  That harm is particularly pronounced here, given the MSPB’s role in \noverseeing and managing the internal workforce of the Executive Branch.  \nMoreover, the public interest is better served by an MSPB member who holds the President’s \nconfidence and, accordingly, will more effectively serve him in executing his duties as Chief Executive.  \n“[T]he Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the ‘dispatch of its own \ninternal affairs.’” Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (quoting Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, \nA.F.L.-C.I.O. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 896 (1961)).  It is especially important that the President have \nsuch latitude to oversee the MSPB, which performs a critical role in managing the Executive Branch’s \nown workforce.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons above, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining \norder. \n \n \nDated: February 13, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              BRETT A.

HARRIS, in her personal capacity   \nand in her official capacity as Member of the   \nMerit Systems Protection Board,       Civil Case No. ______________________ \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n    \n-against-   \n   \nSCOTT BESSENT, in his official capacity as   \nSecretary of the Treasury, TRENT MORSE,   \nin his official capacity as Deputy Assistant to  EMERGENCY HEARING \nthe President and Deputy Director of the  RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED \nWhite House Presidential Personnel Office, \nSERGIO GOR, in his official capacity as \nDirector of the White House Presidential \nPersonnel Office, HENRY J. KERNER, in his \nofficial capacity as Acting Chairman of the \nMerit Systems Protection Board, DONALD J. \nTRUMP, in his official capacity as President \nof the United States of America, RUSSELL \nVOUGHT, in his official capacity as Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S MOTION \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n \nOn February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump purported to terminate Plaintiff Cathy \nA. Harris from her Senate-confirmed role as a Member of the United States Merit Systems \nProtection Board (MSPB). Ms. Harris hereby seeks emergency, interim relief from that illegal \ntermination, which violated a statute conferring for-cause removal protections designed to ensure \nthe independence of the MSPB. \nAs shown below, Ms. Harris is likely to succeed on the merits of her claims that President \nTrump violated the law in terminating her and that the other Defendants may not lawfully treat this \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 2 of 13\npurported termination as valid. Ms. Harris is also suffering clear irreparable injury, including the \ndeprivation of her statutory right to function in office. Moreover, the equities and the public interest \nboth favor interim relief to preserve the status quo while these issues are more fully adjudicated. \nIn light of the historic upheaval currently occurring within federal employment, it is urgent that \nthe MSPB remain operational and free of legal doubt in carrying out its statutory mission.  \nAccordingly, and as set forth below, Ms. Harris seeks a TRO (1) declaring on an interim \nbasis that President Trump’s removal of Ms. Harris from office, and actions from the MSPB while \nshe is not in office, is unlawful, and that Ms. Harris is a Member of the MSPB; and (2) enjoining \nthe remaining Defendants from removing Ms. Harris from her office or in any way treating her as \nhaving been removed, denying or obstructing her in accessing any of the benefits or resources of \nher office, acting on official business of the MSPB without Ms. Harris in office, pending further \norder of the Court. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Merit Systems Protection Board \n  The Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) is an independent agency of the United \nStates. In 1978, Congress first established the MSPB as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978 (“CSRA”), PL 95–454 (S 2640), 92 Stat. 1111 (Oct. 13, 1978). The CSRA was enacted to \naddress widespread public concerns about the federal civil service.1  \n  The legislation that became the CSRA was first proposed by President Carter. In a letter to \nCongress, President Carter requested that Congress create the MSPB, whose members would be \nremovable only for cause. President Carter explained that this structure was intended to “guarantee \n \n1 The Civil Service and the Statutory Law of Public Employment, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1619, 1631–\n32 (1984). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 13\nindependent and impartial protection to employees” and thereby “safeguard the rights of Federal \nemployees who ‘blow the whistle’ on violations of laws or regulations by other employees, \nincluding their supervisors.”2  \n  Over  the  following  seven  months,  Congress  worked  to  formulate  President  Carter’s \nproposal  into  final  legislation.  Throughout  these  deliberations,  Congress  emphasized  the \nimportance of an independent MSPB with sufficient authority to protect the federal workforce \nconsistent with merit system principles. To ensure that independence, Congress in the CSRA \nprovided that the Members of the MSPB “may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Civil Service Reform Act, P.L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, \nCh. 12, § 1202. \n  On October 13, 1978, President Carter signed the CSRA into law, declaring that the \n“landmark legislation” would create “a new system of excellence and accountability.”3  \n  The MSPB’s primary  mission is to provide the people of the United States with a \ncompetent, honest, and productive Federal workforce, provide that Federal personnel management \nis implemented consistent with merit systems principles and free from prohibited personnel \npractices, including reprisal for whistleblowing. Civil Service Reform Act, P.L. 95-454, 92 Stat. \n1111, Ch. 11, § 1101.  \n  Members of the MSPB hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all \nmatters  within  the  MSPB’s  jurisdiction  involving  Federal  employees  and  Federal  agencies. \nMembers of the Board are empowered to order any Federal agency or employee to comply with \n \n2 Federal Civil Service Reform Message to the Congress (Mar. 2, 1978), \nhttps://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/federal-civil-service-reform-message-the-congress. \n3 President Jimmy Carter Remarks on Signing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 into Law \n(Oct. 13, 1978), https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/civil-service-reform-act-1978-\nstatement-signing-s-2640-into-law. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 4 of 13\nany order or decision issued by the Board and enforce compliance with any such order. 5 U.S.C. § \n1204(a)(1)-(2). \n  Members of the MSPB are to conduct, from time to time, special studies relating to the \ncivil service and to other merit systems in the executive branch, and report to the President and to \nthe Congress as to whether the public interest in a civil service free of prohibited personnel \npractices is being adequately protected. 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(3). \n  Members of the MSPB are required to review rules and regulations of the Office of \nPersonnel Management. 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(4). \n  A Member of the MSPB must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. \nMembers of the MSPB must also be “individuals who, by demonstrated ability, background, \ntraining, or experience are especially qualified to carry out the functions of the Board.” 5 U.S.C. § \n1201. \n  Once confirmed, a Member of the MSPB serves a seven-year term and, if a successor has \nnot yet been appointed, up to one additional year. “Any member may be removed by the President \nonly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” 5 U.S.C. § 1202; see also Axon \nEnter. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 181 (2023) (“the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)—a \nseparate agency whose members are themselves removable by the President only for cause, such \nas ‘neglect of duty’ or ‘malfeasance.’) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d)). \nII.  Procedural History \nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris has served as a Member of the MSPB since June 1, 2022, \nfollowing her nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. Ms. Harris’s term \nexpires on March 1, 2028. On February 10, 2025, Ms. Harris received an email from Trent Morse, \nDeputy Assistant to the President and the Deputy Director of the White House Presidential \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 5 of 13\nPersonnel Office, which stated in its entirety: “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am \nwriting to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, \neffective immediately. Thank you for your service[.]” Ex. A.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo obtain a TRO, a movant must show that “(1) it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) it \nis likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities \ntips in [its] favor; and (4) the issuance of a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.” Alpine \nSec. Corp. v. FINRA, 121 F.4th 1314, 1324 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted); \naccord Council on Am.-Islamic Rels. v. Gaubatz, 667 F. Supp. 2d 67, 74 (D.D.C. 2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiff Has a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits. \nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris is substantially likely to prevail on her claims, all of which rest \non the premise that she has been unlawfully removed from office in violation of her statutory for-\ncause removal protection. See 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d). In purporting to terminate Ms. Harris on behalf \nof President Trump, Mr. Morse stated only that Ms. Harris was “terminated, effective immediately” \nand did not reference any finding of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Id. \nAccordingly, this termination notice facially violated 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d). Plaintiff will therefore \nprevail  unless  her  statutory  for-cause  removal  protection  is  unconstitutional—and  she  is \nsubstantially likely to show that this protection is fully consistent with the constitutional separation \nof powers and applicable Supreme Court precedents. \nThe Supreme Court’s original pronouncement on this issue is Humphrey’s Executor v. \nUnited States, which upheld the constitutionality of a materially identical restriction on the \nPresident’s authority to remove members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 295 U.S. 602, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 6 of 13\n625-26, 629 (1935). There, the Supreme Court explained that Congress had created the FTC as an \nindependent agency—and that the FTC held not only executive authorities, but also “specified ties \nas a legislative or as a judicial aid” that distinguished it from being “an arm or an eye of the \nexecutive.” Id. at 628. For example, the FTC was required to “mak[e] investigations and reports \nthereon for the information of Congress ... in aid of the legislative power,” in which function it \n“acts as a legislative agency.” Id. Because of the FTC’s quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial roles, \nthe Supreme Court concluded that Congress could appropriately impose for-cause limits against \npresidential removal. More broadly, the Supreme Court recognized in Humphrey’s Executor that \nCongress could shield agency heads from removal without cause where Congress deemed such \nprotections necessary to secure a measure of impartiality, expertise, and independence. That ruling \nwas no small matter: it forms the basis for a substantial part of the modern federal government and \nhas been repeatedly reaffirmed. E.g., Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 355-56 (1958); \nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 410-11 & n.32 (1989); Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., \nAFLCIO v. Gates, 486 F.3d 1316, 1328-29 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (Kavanaugh, J.). \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has identified several contexts in which for-cause \nremoval limits unduly infringe on Article II—either because an independent agency’s leadership \nis too insulated from presidential control or because a single-director agency’s power and functions \nrequire more robust presidential supervision. The reasoning of those authorities only confirms that \nthe limited for-cause removal protection afforded to Members of the MSPB is constitutional. \nThe Supreme Court began this line of cases by addressing a scheme that created too many \nlayers of insulation between agency officials and the President. Specifically, in Free Enterprise \nFund v. PCAOB, the Supreme Court considered removal protections for members of the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), an independent multi-member agency within \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 7 of 13\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 561 U.S. 477, 485 (2010). The PCAOB was \nvested with broad power to regulate the accounting industry and impose severe financial penalties \nto enforce its rules. See id. Members of the PCAOB could be removed by the SEC only for willful \nviolations of the law or abuses of authority. See id. at 486-87. Commissioners of the SEC, in turn, \ncould be removed by the President only for cause. See id. at 503. Confronted with this novel \nscheme—in which the layering of “dual for-cause limitations” precluded the President from \ndirectly removing PCAOB members—the Supreme Court struck it down. Id. at 492, 495-96. In so \nholding, however, the Court maintained precedents affirming the constitutionality of single-layer \nremoval provisions directly beneath the President, as is true of the MSPB. See id. at 495, 508. \nSince PCAOB, the Supreme Court has issued two opinions invalidating removal limits for \nsingle-headed agencies that wield substantial regulatory and enforcement authority over private \nactors. First came Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020). \nThere, the Supreme Court noted that for-cause removal limits for single-person agency leadership \nstructures are a relatively recent phenomenon. See id. at 220-22. It then concluded that applying \nsuch statutory protections to the Director of the CFPB raised exceptionally grave concerns in light \nof the Director’s broad power to “issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement \npriorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose on private parties.” Id. at \n225. As the Supreme Court noted, the Director’s authority to “dictate and enforce policy for a vital \nsegment of the economy affecting millions of Americans” infringed on Article II. Id. And this \nviolation was magnified by the CFPB’s unique funding structure, which ensured automatic funding \nthrough the Federal Reserve and defeated a crucial source of potential accountability to the \nPresident. See id. at 226. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the President must be able to \nremove the CFPB Director at will. See id. at 227-238.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 8 of 13\nThe Court’s decision in Selia Law cast into doubt removal protections at the Federal \nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA)—which were stricken down one year later in Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220 (2021). See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 222. In reaching this conclusion, reasoned that \nasserted differences between the CFPB and FHFA regarding the “nature and breadth” of their \nauthority were not dispositive of the constitutional analysis—adding that the FHFA was in some \nrespects more powerful than the CFPB and that it had direct “regulatory and enforcement authority \nover two companies that dominate the secondary mortgage market and have the power to reshape \nthe housing sector.” 594 U.S. at 251, 253. \nTogether, Humphrey’s Executor, Seila Law, and Collins all support the constitutionality of \nthe MSPB’s for-cause removal provision. Four considerations anchor that conclusion. \nFirst, Seila Law and Collins were fundamentally animated by a profound concern about the \nPresident’s inability to remove officials exercising executive power in ways that could “dictate and \nenforce policy for a vital segment of the economy affecting millions of Americans.” Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 225; accord Collins, 594 U.S. at 255 (highlighting that “FHFA’s control over Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac can deeply impact the lives of millions of Americans by affecting their \nability to buy and keep their homes”). That concern is not present here. The MSPB is a primarily \nquasi-judicial agency with limited advisory and reporting functions—all focused exclusively on \nfederal personnel issues. In performing these functions, the MSPB does not regulate or penalize \nprivate activity. See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221 (noting that the OSC, which brings cases before \nthe MSPB, “does not bind private parties at all”). The MSPB lacks the power to commence \nprosecutions, bring suits in an Article III tribunal, or control (whether directly or indirectly) the \nsubstantive regulatory framework for any public or private entities. While the MSPB’s work is \ntruly essential, it occurs within a “limited jurisdiction” related to federal employers and employees. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 9 of 13\nId. at 221. It poses no “special threat to individual liberty” for the Members of the MSPB to receive \nlimited  independence  from  direct  political  control  in  reviewing  and  investigating  alleged \nprohibited personnel practices from federal employees. See id. at 223. \nSecond, consistent with the reasoning of  Humphrey’s Executor, the  MSPB exists to \nvindicate quasi-legislative functions and interests held in common by Congress, the Executive \nBranch, and the public. Congress carefully designed the MSPB to play an important reporting role \nwith respect to legislative oversight and deliberations. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(l) & 1205. The \nMSPB’s work also furthers the distinct, quasi-legislative interest in promoting Executive Branch \ncompliance with congressionally imposed merit system and personnel requirements. In that \nrespect, the MSPB is more than just an aspect of the executive power. See Humphrey’s Executor, \n295 U.S. at 628. On this point, it is especially notable that the MSPB’s structure—specifically \nincluding its for-cause removal provision for Members—reflects an intent to create independence \nfrom the President.  \nThird, the need for independence at the MSPB is unique in its character and purposes. With \nrespect to the CFPB and FHFA, the case for agency independence rested heavily on a substantive \nbelief that economic regulation should be free of specific forms of presidential political control. \nSee Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; Collins, 594 U.S. at 229-30. Put differently, agency independence \nin those settings was specifically designed to restrain the President’s ability to direct the agencies’ \nregulatory powers consistent with his agenda. Here, in contrast, the MSPB lacks broad-reaching \nregulatory powers—and the independence afforded by its statutory for-cause removal provisions \nserves an entirely different function. Rather than hamper the President’s substantive regulatory \nagenda,  the  MSPB’s  independence  functions  to  protect  and  assure  civil  servants  and \nwhistleblowers. If the officials charged with adjudicating claims of whistleblower retaliation were \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 10 of 13\nutterly vulnerable to retaliation and removal for reviewing politically charged or inconvenient \ncases, then the purpose of a merit system and whistleblower protections might fail when it is most \nneeded. Simply put, Congress reasonably concluded that the MSPB cannot serve as an independent \nprotector of a merit system if the Members are subject at all times to removal without cause by the \nPresident. \nFinally, the presence of the for-cause removal limitation does not completely exempt the \nMSPB from accountability. The MSPB remains accountable through its substantial reporting \nobligations—and through the traditional appropriations process, which requires that Congress and \nthe President approve the agency’s funding, unlike the CFPB’s and the FHFA’s deliberately \ninsulated funding schemes. See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225-26; Collins, 594 U.S. at 231. \nConsidering all this and applying the presumption of constitutionality afforded to Acts of \nCongress, see Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170, 175 (1978), the MSPB’s removal protection \nis plainly constitutional. Because President Trump purported to terminate Ms. Harris in flagrant \ndisregard of that protection—and thus offended a squarely applicable statutory limit—Plaintiff is \nlikely to succeed on the merits of her claims in this action. \nII.  Plaintiff Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent Relief. \nInterim relief is further justified because Ms. Harris is suffering irreparable injury from \nDefendants’ conduct, which is depriving her in real time of her statutory entitlement to serve as a \nMember of the MSPB.4 This Court has recognized that even if the deprivation of a senior \ngovernment official’s “statutory right to function” is temporary, the injury to them and their agency \nis both significant and irreparable. Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. \n \n4 In assessing whether the plaintiff has suffered an irreparable harm, this Court must assume that \nMs. Harris has demonstrated a likelihood that Defendants’ conduct violates the law. Chaplaincy \nof Full Gospel Churches v. English, 454 F.3d 290, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 11 of 13\nNov. 14, 1983) (granting preliminary injunction against removal of plaintiffs as members of the \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam). \nCertainly, a damages remedy after a final judgment and all appeals have been exhausted is \nordinarily inadequate. See Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, 147 (D.D.C. 1993) (granting TRO \nagainst removal of plaintiff members of Postal Service Board of Governors), vacated as moot sub \nnom. Mackie v. Clinton, 10 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (per curiam). \nFor two additional reasons, Plaintiff’s showing of irreparable injury is especially acute. \nFirst, if another person is nominated and confirmed to the role of Member of the MSPB, then her \nclaim to that role will be mooted, and her judicial remedy extinguished entirely despite the \nillegality of her termination throughout this period. See, e.g., Berry v. Reagan, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. \nCir. 1983); Mackie v. Clinton, 10 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Second, the denial of immediate \nemergency relief—and ensuing confusion or uncertainty about the status of the MSPB—may \ndeprive Plaintiff and the MSPB of the “ability to fulfill [their] mandate” to federal employees, \nBerry, 1983 WL 538, at *5, including those whose challenges to personnel actions are pending \nnow before the MPSB.  \nAccordingly, this case is nothing like a garden-variety employment dispute in which an \nemployee seeks backpay or similar remedies for wrongful termination. Ms. Harris is not suing for \nmonetary harm but instead the fundamental loss of her public office. And even if the purely private \nemployment context were a relevant comparator, then Ms. Harris’s request would present exactly \nthe kind of “extraordinary case[]” in which removal from office warrants extraordinary relief. \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974). \nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Favor Plaintiff. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 12 of 13\nOver the past several weeks, the Administration has announced the placement of many \nthousands of employees and officials throughout the federal government on administrative leave. \nThese personnel actions have generated widespread uncertainty among career civil servants and \nagency officials. See Erica Green et al., Trump’s Moves to Upend Federal Bureaucracy Touch Off \nFear and Confusion, N.Y. Times (Jan 25, 2025). In this context, the proper functioning of the \nMSPB is more vital than ever—and the unlawful termination of a Senate-confirmed MSPB \nMember creates a gap in protections provided by the MSPB, risking severe confusion over the \nleadership, mission, and role of the agency (as well as doubt over the lawfulness of any actions \nthat it takes). Congress created the MSPB to protect the federal workforce consistent with merit \nsystem principles. See United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 444-45 (1988) (CSRA created \n“integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate \ninterests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient \nadministration.”). Ensuring that the MSPB can carry out its statutory mission is plainly in the \npublic interest.  \nHere, Plaintiff asks only that the Court preserve the status quo while the weighty issues she \nraises are more fully adjudicated. Such relief would vindicate important equities and public \npurposes, while inflicting marginal burdens on Defendants, who will soon enough have an \nopportunity to fully present their case and seek to defend their unprecedented conduct. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris’s motion for a TRO should be granted \nand the Court should order the proposed TRO submitted by Plaintiff. \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 2-1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 13 of 13\n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Michael J.

That is not the law, and it has not been for decades upon decades.  Full \nstop.   \nAs this Court’s prior order recognized, this is an easy case.  Under Humphrey’s Executor v. \nUnited States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and its progeny, Congress may enact legislation ensuring that \nthose who serve on “multimember expert agencies” may not be removed except for cause.  Seila \nLaw LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 218 (2020).  The Merit Systems Protections Board is precisely \nthe kind of “traditional” “multimember board,” id. at 207, that does not exercise “substantial \nexecutive power,” id. at 218, and instead fulfills a quintessentially “quasi judicial” function, \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.  The Board is a purely “adjudicatory body.”  Wiener v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958).  It does not launch investigations, fill up vague statutes, \nset fair prices and prohibit unfair practices, or regulate “the economy at large.”  Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021).  Rather, the Board receives and hears cases brought to it regarding civil \nservants, including claims of partisan discrimination and whistleblower retaliation, neutrally \napplying the laws that Congress passed to “limit, restrict, and regulate the removal” of federal \nemployees.  United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886); see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. \n137, 172 (1803).  The Board’s decisions, in turn, are subject to judicial review in Article III courts.  \nIt  is  difficult  to  identify  an  “adjudicatory  body”  that  would  fall  more  squarely  within  the \nHumphrey’s Executor framework than the Merit Systems Protection Board.  Wiener, 357 U.S. at \n356.  \nThe government admits (at 13) that “[o]verturning Humphrey’s Executor is, of course, not \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 9 of 28\nan option available to this Court.”  But make no mistake:  Ruling for the government in this case \nmeans overturning Humphrey’s Executor—to say nothing of Marbury v. Madison, United States v. \nPerkins, Wiener v. United States, and more.  The new Administration’s breathtaking argument is a \nconstitutional bull in a china shop.  If the Merit Systems Protections Board is not constitutional \nbecause its members exercise an iota of executive power, Congress cannot ever provide an \nadjudicatory body with the most modest removal protections—and likely cannot even prevent the \narbitrary dismissal of ordinary civil servants.   \nAt the end of the day, even the government realizes its extreme view of presidential power \nthreatens our constitutional system.  So it incomprehensibly backtracks, asserting (at 12) “some \nagencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, might be assessed differently.”  This admission \ngives up the game.  If the independent Federal Reserve Board is constitutional—for the sake of \nthe global economy, let’s hope it is—the far more modest Merit Systems Protection Board passes \nmuster.  The government’s halfhearted suggestion that the Board wields a unique degree of \nexecutive power is wrong.  As our opening brief explained, the Board exercises less authority than \nthe War Claims Commission, which the Supreme Court upheld in Wiener.  The government \ntellingly offers no response.   \nFinally, the government once again argues that the executive is effectively immune from \njudicial  review  because  this  Court  may  not  issue  a  meaningful  remedy  to  Plaintiff.   That \nextraordinary suggestion is as incorrect as it sounds.  Article III courts are not powerless to enforce \nthe law.  As the D.C. Circuit confirmed in Swan and Severino, both removal cases, the Court may \nissue “[i]njunctive relief” “against subordinate executive officials.”  Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, \n980 (D.C. Cir. 1996); accord Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. Cir. 2023); see also \nDellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (per \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 10 of 28\ncuriam).  And if equitable relief were not an option here (to be clear: it is), a long line of Anglo-\nAmerican precedent dating to Blackstone and Marbury v. Madison confirms that “mandamus” \nprovides a “full and effectual remedy” “for wrongful removal.”  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries \non the Laws of England *264-265.  Indeed, “a request for an injunction” “is essentially a request \nfor a writ of mandamus in this context,” and the long history of mandamus confirms that an \ninjunction is appropriate.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 977 n.1.  To prevent any doubt for purposes of \nappellate review, Plaintiff requests the Court make clear that it would grant mandamus in the \nalternative, if equitable relief is not available. \nAt bottom, the government’s constitutional theory “in all the nakedness in which it is \npresented” is incorrect.  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  The President cannot “remove a member of an \nadjudicatory body” “merely because he want[s] his own appointees.”  Id.  No “such power is given \nto the President directly by the Constitution.”  Id.  This Court can and should say so, preserve our \nconstitutional order, and rule for Harris. \nARGUMENT  \nI.  Humphrey’s Executor Is Controlling. \nA.  This case is controlled by settled precedent.  As our opening brief explained, the \nSupreme Court has always been careful to preserve Humphrey’s Executor and its progeny.   \nIn Seila Law, the Supreme Court went out of its way to contrast the “novel” Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau “led by a single Director” with traditional “multimember expert \nagencies that do not wield substantial executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204.  Indeed, the \nCourt confirmed that Congress could convert the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau “into a \nmultimember agency.”  Id. at 237; see also Pltf.’s Mem., ECF No. 22 at 17 (“Pltf.’s Mem.”).  \nMeanwhile, in Collins, the Court conducted a “straightforward application” of “Seila Law,” and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 11 of 28\ndid not “revisit” its “prior decisions allowing certain limitations on the President’s removal power.”  \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 251 (quotation marks omitted).  Far from there being “ ‘little to nothing left \nof’ ” Humphrey’s Executor, Gov. Opp., ECF No. 33 at 8 (“Gov. Opp.”), Humphrey’s Executor and \nits progeny unquestionably remain untouched after Seila Law and Collins.   \nAs  our  opening  brief  explained,  the  Board  falls  within  the  Humphrey’s  Executor \nframework.  The Board is a purely adjudicatory body, focused inwardly on the government, that \ndecides the cases brought to it.  See Pltf.’s Mem. at 12-13.  The Board does not wield substantial \nexecutive  authority,  and  Congress  carefully  tailored  the  Board’s  jurisdiction  to  avoid  any \nseparation of powers concerns.  See id. at 14-16.  Indeed, the Merit Systems Protection Board is \non even firmer footing than most traditional multimember commissions because the Board furthers \nCongress’s long-recognized authority to regulate the civil service.  See id. at 13-14.  Meanwhile, \nthe Board is a traditional multimember body composed of members from different political parties \nwho serve staggered terms—precisely the kind of entity upheld in Humphrey’s Executor and \nWiener, and distinguished as constitutional in Seila Law and Collins.  See id. at 17-20. \nB.  In arguing that the Board is unconstitutional, the government initially starts from the \nextreme position that the Constitution mandates that anyone who exercises executive power—to \nany degree—must be removable by the President at will.  See Gov. Opp. at 1 (arguing that Harris \nmust be removable at will because she “exercise[s] some of the executive Power”); see also, e.g., \nid. at 5, 7-11.  \nOur opening brief explained why this view of the removal power is wrong, and outlined \nhow the government has misread the Supreme Court’s opinions.  For example, we dispelled the \ngovernment’s cramped interpretation of Seila Law and Collins, and explained why Humphrey’s \nExecutor’s use of the term “quasi judicial” does not mean the case is a dead letter.  Pltf.’s Mem. at \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 12 of 28\n23-26.  In response, the government copies and pastes its TRO filings nearly verbatim, declining \nto meaningfully engage with our analysis.  That silence speaks volumes.     \nThe government pays lip service (e.g., at 6) to the notion that Congress may “limit, restrict, \nand regulate the removal” of inferior officers and civil servants.  Perkins, 116 U.S. at 485.  But it \nis difficult to square those for-cause removal protections—which Congress has enacted since the \nFounding, see Marbury, 5 U.S. at 172—with the government’s limitless theory of the removal \npower.  If the President must possess the ability “to remove all executive officials simply because \nthey  wield  ‘executive’  power,”  there  is  no  coherent  basis  to  distinguish  for-cause  removal \nprovisions protecting multimember commissions from similar provisions for “ ‘inferior’ executive \nofficials” and ordinary federal employees.  Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689 n.27 (1988).  \nInstead, accepting the government’s legal argument in this case would mean the President may fire \nanyone in the executive branch for whatever reason—something which has never been the law at \nany point in American history.  \nThe government also attempts to downplay the natural consequences of its legal argument, \ni.e., that every independent agency is unconstitutional.  According to the government (at 12), there \n“are good reasons to think that some agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, might be \nassessed differently.”  This suggestion does not wash.  The Federal Reserve Board clearly exercises \nexecutive power.  It “dictate[s] and enforce[s] policy” for “the economy” as a whole.  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 225.  Nor can the government credibly maintain that the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard—with its purely adjudicatory role and targeted jurisdiction—somehow exercises more \nexecutive power than the Federal Reserve Board.  Regardless, if the independent Federal Reserve \nBoard is constitutional, then the government’s core legal theory is wrong, and those who exercise \nexecutive authority need not always be removable at will.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 13 of 28\nMeanwhile, the government’s suggestion that the Federal Reserve Board “might have \nspecial historical status” that could differentiate it from other independent agencies rebounds in \nthis case.  Gov. Opp. at 12 (quotation marks omitted).  The Merit Systems Protection Board also \nreflects a long-established American tradition of Congress regulating the removal of civil servants \nand is distinguishable on the same basis.   \nC.  The government tries to argue that the Merit Systems Protection Board exercises a \nunique degree of authority that distinguishes the Board from other independent agencies.  These \narguments are difficult to take seriously.  The fact that the Board “hear[s]” cases and “issue[s] final \norders” does not mean it exercises an impermissible “executive function.”  Gov. Opp. at 7 \n(quotation marks omitted, first alteration in original).  Quite the opposite.  A board hearing cases \nis the ne plus ultra of an “adjudicatory body.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  Indeed, as our opening \nbrief explained (at 25), the Board exercises less authority than the War Claims Commission upheld \nin Wiener.  The Commission issued non-reviewable decisions, whereas the Board’s decisions are \nreviewable in Article III courts.  Here again, the government’s lack of a response is telling.  \nThe government (at 3) mischaracterizes the Board’s role as reviewing “how much of the \nExecutive Branch supervises its workforce” and overseeing “the bulk of the federal workforce.”  \nThat is wildly inaccurate.  When the Board adjudicates contested claims between employees and \nagencies—such as allegations of prohibited partisan retaliation—the Board does not supervise \nagencies.  See Pltf.’s Mem. at 4-5.  It applies the law in a “quasi judicial” manner.  Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 624.   \nDon’t take our word for it.  Take the government’s.  In the Dellinger case, the government \nvigorously contested the notion that the Board’s role as an adjudicatory body means it supervises \nthe agencies before it—in that case, the single-director led Office of Special Counsel.  See Gov. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 14 of 28\nReply at 4, ECF No. 25, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) \n(“Plaintiff also argues that the Special Counsel is ‘effectively’ supervised by the MSPB.  But that \nmakes no sense:  The Special Counsel is not ‘supervised’ by the MSPB any more than the Solicitor \nGeneral is ‘supervised’ by the Supreme Court.” (citation omitted)).  The government can hardly \nargue the opposite in this case. \nThe government points (at 7) to the fact that, in certain appeals, the Board can “modify or \nreduce the penalties that agencies impose on their employees.”  But when an employee argues that \na penalty imposed is unreasonable or arbitrary, the Board is careful to defer to the “agency’s broad \ndiscretion to determine the appropriate penalty for a particular case.”  Lucas v. USPS, No. 2023-\n2345, 2024 WL 1852935, at *5 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 29, 2024).1  Regardless, when the Board acts to \nreduce penalties, it no more exercises substantial executive authority than does an Article III court \nwhen it reviews an executive-imposed fine.  In both cases, the Board and the court act as \nadjudicators. \nThe government also points to the fact that the Board may “send its own attorneys (not the \nDepartment of Justice attorneys) to litigate civil actions outside the Supreme Court” and is a \n“named respondent” in some cases.  Gov. Opp. at 7.  But the government tellingly omits the big \ndifference between the Board and the Department of Justice:  The Board does not initiate litigation \n \n1 See, e.g., Einboden v. Dept. of Navy, 802 F.3d 1321, 1325–26 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (“We give wide \nberth to agency decisions as to what type of adverse action is necessary to promote the efficiency \nof the service, provided that the agency’s decision bears some nexus to the reason for the adverse \naction.”) (quotation marks omitted); Greer v. Dept. of Army, 79 M.S.P.R. 477, 485 (MSPB 1998) \n(“Normally the Board should give deference to the judgment by each agency of the employee’s \nperformance in light of the agency’s assessment of its own personnel needs and standards.”) \n(same); Special Counsel ex. rel. Cefalu v. DOJ, MSPB Dkt. No. CB-1208-13-0006-U-2, at 5 \n(MSPB Dec. 6, 2012) (“Employees’ free speech rights must be balanced, however, against the \nneed of government agencies to exercise ‘wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive \noversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.’ ”) (quoting Mings v. Dep’t of \nJustice, 813 F.2d 384, 387 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 15 of 28\n(for example, to bring an enforcement action).  Rather, in limited circumstances the Board may \nrepresent itself when sued.2  As our opening brief explained (at 26), and as the government never \naddresses, this circumscribed authority primarily ensures the Board’s expert attorneys may provide \ncourts their perspective on complex procedural appeals.  \nIndeed, the ability to litigate cases is a typical feature of independent agencies, a fact which \nonly underscores the degree to which adopting the government’s position here would require \noverturning Humphrey’s Executor.  See, e.g., 15 U.S.C § 2061(a) (Consumer Product Safety \nCommission); 42 U.S.C § 7171(i) (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission); 5 U.S.C § 7105(h) \n(Federal Labor Relations Authority); 46 U.S.C § 41307(a), (d) (Federal Maritime Commission); \n12 U.S.C § 248(p) (Federal Reserve); 15 U.S.C § 53(b) (Federal Trade Commission); 29 U.S.C \n§ 154(a) (National Labor Relations Board); 49 U.S.C. § 1301(c)(1) (Surface Transportation \nBoard); 39 U.S.C. § 409 (United States Postal Service).  And the Merit Systems Protection Board \nlacks litigating authority in the Supreme Court, confirming that it is not exercising executive power \nto speak on behalf of the government in that forum. \nNor is the Board’s capacity to appear in court when sued a uniquely executive function.  \nFederal district courts, for example, retain attorneys to litigate on their behalf in mandamus cases, \nin which the judge is formally deemed the respondent,3 and the houses of Congress may litigate \n \n2 The chief exception is that the Board may act as a plaintiff to enforce subpoenas.  This “is a very \nrare occurrence” and it has not “occurred” during Harris’s tenure on the Board.  Harris Decl., ECF \nNo. 22-3 at 8.  And if this modest power truly offended the Constitution, the remedy is to invalidate \nthat narrow authority, not declare the for-cause removal provision unconstitutional. \n3 See, e.g., Katelyn Polantz, Judge in Michael Flynn Case Hires Prominent DC Law Firm to Help \nWith Appeal, CNN (May 24, 2020), https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/23/politics/emmet-sullivan-\nmichael-flynn-appeal-wilkinson-walsh/index.html. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 16 of 28\non their own behalf in court.4  The government’s invocation (at 7) of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n(1976),  is  puzzling.    In  that  case,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  Congress  cannot  appoint \ncommissioners, a question which is not the issue here.  Id. at 113, 137.  Quite unlike the Board, \nthe Federal Election Commission at issue in Buckley did exercise “direct and wide ranging” \n“enforcement power.”  Id. at 111.  Even then, the Supreme Court cited Humphrey’s Executor and \nmade clear that “the President may not insist that such functions be delegated to an appointee of \nhis removable at will.”  Id. at 141. \nFinally, the government argues that the Board can review certain “rules of the Office of \nPersonnel Management.”  Gov. Opp. at 7.  But as we explained in our opening brief, see Pltf.’s \nMem. at 25, that power is limited to ensuring the Office of Personnel Management’s regulations \ndo not conflict with a narrow range of employment laws, and the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management may seek judicial review where he disagrees with the Board.  In practice, \nit is “exceedingly rare” for the Board to review Office of Personnel Management regulations, and \nit has never occurred during Harris’s tenure.  Harris Decl., ECF No. 22-3 at ¶ 31.  Regardless, even \nif Congress somehow crossed the line in granting the Board this narrow authority (or any other), \nthe appropriate remedy would be to invalidate that particular power in an appropriate case. \n* * * \nThis Court got it right in its TRO decision:  The case is “on all fours with Humphrey’s \nExecutor” and its progeny.  Mem. Op., ECF No. 9 at 8-9.  This Court should apply settled law and \nrule for Harris. \n \n4 See, e.g., Moore v. U.S. House of Representatives, 733 F.2d 946 (D.C. Cir. 1984); U.S. House of \nRepresentatives v. Burwell, 130 F. Supp. 3d 53 (D.D.C. 2015); U.S. House of Representatives v. \nUnited States Dep’t of Com., 11 F. Supp. 2d 76 (D.D.C. 1998). \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 17 of 28\nII.  The Court Has The Authority To Issue Relief. \nJust as the government is wrong on the merits, it is wrong on remedy.  Everything from \nBlackstone to recently published D.C. Circuit precedent confirms this Court may grant a “full and \neffectual remedy” “for wrongful removal.”  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of \nEngland *264-265.  The Court should order a declaration that Plaintiff may be removed only for \n“inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” Compl., ECF No. 1 at 12, and an \ninjunction against removing Plaintiff from her office or treating her as having been removed.  id.   \nFor the reasons discussed below, the government is wrong when it suggests this Court may \nnot order injunctive relief.  But the government’s arguments about injunctions make no difference \nanyway.  Count V of the complaint requests mandamus relief.  The Court should make clear that \nit would alternatively grant mandamus relief if an injunction is unavailable.  Id. at 10.  There is an \nextremely  long  tradition  of  Anglo-American  courts  issuing  mandamus  in  precisely  these \ncircumstances, and an alternative grant of mandamus would dispel any doubt regarding this \nCourt’s remedial authority and provide the best record for appellate review.5 \nA.  The Court Should Issue Injunctive And Declaratory Relief. \n1.  According to binding precedent, this Court may issue “[i]njunctive relief” in removal \ncases.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 980; accord Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042-1043.  The D.C. Circuit in Swan \nheld that courts have the authority to issue injunctions to “redress” an official’s “injury” caused by \nunlawful removal.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 980.  Just two years ago, Severino reaffirmed that courts \n“can enjoin ‘subordinate executive officials’ to reinstate a wrongly terminated official.”  Severino, \n71 F.4th at 1042-43 (quoting Swan, 100 F.3d at 980)); see Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1.  \n \n5 Plaintiff continues to request that relief (including mandamus) run against all the Defendants with \nthe exception of the President.  Pltf.’s Mem. at 31 n.23. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 18 of 28\nThat is precisely the relief Plaintiff seeks.6   \nIf that were not enough, additional precedent confirms that equitable relief is available in \nremoval cases.  In Sampson v. Murray, the Supreme Court explained that a federal court may \n“review the claim of a discharged governmental employee” and employ its “injunctive power” to \nremedy the injury.  415 U.S. 61, 71, 92 n.68 (1974).  In Service v. Dulles—on which Sampson \nrelied, id. at 71—a federal employee had sought both injunctive and declaratory relief and obtained \nthat relief on remand after the Supreme Court held his termination unlawful.  354 U.S. 363, 370, \n389 (1957) (cited at Pltf.’s Mem. at. 34 n.24).  And in Vitarelli v. Seaton, a federal employee \nsimilarly sought “a declaration that his dismissal had been illegal and ineffective and an injunction \nrequiring his reinstatement,” and the Court held that he was “entitled to the reinstatement which \nhe seeks.”  359 U.S. 535, 537, 546 (1959) (same).   \nOther courts—including this one—have issued injunctive relief in analogous contexts.  See, \ne.g., Paroczay v. Hodges, 219 F. Supp. 89, 95 (D.D.C. 1963) (ordering that Department of \nCommerce official was “entitled to be reinstated to his position” and retaining jurisdiction to issue \n“a mandatory injunction” to enforce that judgment); Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, \nat *6 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983) (enjoining the “prevent[ion] or interfer[ence] with plaintiffs[’] \nservice as members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights”), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, 148 (D.D.C. 1993) (enjoining termination of \nPostal Service Board of Governors members), vacated as moot sub nom. Mackie v. Clinton, 10 \nF.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993); cf. Johnson v. Bergland, 586 F.2d 993, 996 (4th Cir. 1978) (granting \npreliminary junction to state official whose First and Fifth Amendment rights were violated by \n \n6 The government’s attempt (at 16) to distinguish Swan—arguing that relief may be available for \npurposes of Article III redressability yet unavailable “as a remedy” when sought—makes no sense.  \nThe D.C. Circuit meant what it said:  This court may issue an injunction. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 19 of 28\nremoval). \n2.  Plaintiff satisfies the factors for a permanent injunction.   \nAs the Court recognized at the TRO stage, without an injunction Plaintiff will suffer \nirreparable harm from the loss of her “statutory right to function” as an independent Board member \nfree from fear or favor, and no amount of backpay can remedy that harm.  Pltf.’s Mem at 29 \n(quoting TRO Op., ECF No. 9 at 15).  As Judge Jackson put it in Dellinger:  “This is not a routine \ncase dealing with a terminated probationary employee.”  Mem. Op., Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-\nCV-385, at 61 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 2025).  Indeed, no one would contest that an Article III judge \nwrongfully barred from his chambers by an executive branch official would face irreparable harm \nand should not be satisfied with some dollars and cents from backpay as a remedy.  The same is \ntrue for Plaintiff, who is an adjudicator and who Congress protected with a special for-cause \nremoval protection.  See id. (granting permanent injunction and finding the inability “to fulfill” a \n“statutory duty” is “a loss that can never be restored”).  Moreover, even a temporary unlawful \nremoval will forever harm the independence that Congress deemed so critical to the Board’s \nfunctioning.  Cf. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) (explaining that even a temporary \ndenial of official immunity is “effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial”); \nMills v. District of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (it has “long been established \nthat  the  loss  of  constitutional  freedoms,  for  even  minimal  periods  of  time,  unquestionably \nconstitutes irreparable injury”) (quotation marks omitted).  In addition, for the reasons described \nbelow, following the retirement of member Raymond A. Limon on February 28, 2025, the Board \nwill be irreparably harmed because it will be unable to function absent an injunction.  See infra \np. 14. \nIn arguing that Harris faces no meaningful harm (at 19), the government primarily cites \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 20 of 28\nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820 (1997).  But Raines confirms that when individuals are “deprived \nof something to which they personally are entitled” like “seats as Members of Congress” (or \npositions as members of the Board), they do suffer a legally cognizable harm.  Id. at 821.  That \nsupports an injunction in this case.  Meanwhile, the government dismisses the harms to the Board \non the theory that the Board “will not cease to exist,” Gov. Opp. at 19-20 & n.9, as would have \noccurred with the commission at issue in Berry v. Regan.  But Berry’s holding was not so limited.  \nThe court there looked to “the obviously disruptive effect the denial of” “relief” would have.  \nBerry, 1983 WL 538 at *5 (emphasis omitted).  In that case, the disruption happened to be the \ncommission’s expiration.  In this case, the Board of which Plaintiff is a lawful member will be \nunable to function for an indefinite period of time, a harm which cannot be remedied by backpay. \nThe remaining injunctive relief factors favor Plaintiff.  The government does not—and \ncannot—dispute the public interest in requiring the executive to abide by the rule of law.  Pltf.’s \nMem. at 29.  Meanwhile, the government continues (at 20-21) to repackage its merits argument \nthat the President has the right to remove Harris (he does not) into a putative harm to the President \nfrom being unable to remove Harris.  But that argument wrongly collapses the government’s view \nof the merits with harm to the government, the latter factor which courts only reach if the plaintiff \nhas “prevailed” on the merits.  Wilkinson v. Legal Servs. Corp., 27 F. Supp. 2d 32, 65 (D.D.C. \n1998); see also Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. \n1998) (court properly considered injunction factors “once the court reached [a] conclusion” on the \nmerits); Nichols v. Truscott, 424 F. Supp. 2d 124, 143 (D.D.C. 2006) (“Actual success on the merits \nis naturally a prerequisite to permanent injunctive relief.”).   \nFinally, an injunction is even more clearly in the public’s interest today than when Harris \nfirst filed her motion.  On February 28, 2025, member Raymond A. Limon announced his \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 21 of 28\nretirement effective the same day, leaving the Merit Systems Protection Board with only two \nmembers.7  Absent relief from this Court and without Harris, the Board will have only a single \nmember and will thus lack a quorum.  A single member’s authority is limited to forwarding a \nnarrowly circumscribed set of matters to an administrative judge.  5 C.F.R. §§ 1200.3(c)(1)-(4).  \nThe lack of a quorum will immediately harm the public because the Board will be unable to \nperform the essential functions Congress empowered it to exercise: adjudicating petitions for \nreview of decisions issued by administrative judges.  See 5 C.F.R. §§ 1200.3(a), (c).   \nThe harm will be particularly serious to federal employees with meritorious cases.  If \nneither party files a petition before the Board, the aggrieved party may treat the administrative \njudge’s decision as final and appeal to an Article III court.  But if a party chooses to file a petition \nbefore the quorum-less Board, the appeal will remain in abeyance until either (1) the party \nwithdraws the petition, or (2) the Board regains a quorum.  The latter scenario facilitates a degree \nof procedural gamesmanship.  When the Board has previously lost a quorum, federal agencies \ncould and did file petitions for review in cases in which the administrative judge ruled for the \nemployee.  In some cases, the tactic could place the employee in limbo, unable to pursue the \nmeritorious case to completion so long as the agency’s petition remained pending and the Board \nlacked a quorum.  See, e.g., Howell v. HUD, No. DC-0432-13-6622-I-2, 2023 WL 303824, at *1 \n& n.3 (MSPB Jan. 18, 2023) (case was held in abeyance without temporary relief for the employee \nwhile the Board lacked a quorum).  That open-ended delay is precisely what Congress did not want \nin setting up the Board.  \n3.  The Court can and should also issue declaratory relief.  See Salleh v. Christopher, 876 \n \n7 William Spencer, Member Raymond A. Limon Retiring, U.S. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION \nBOARD  (Feb  28,  2025), \nhttps://www.mspb.gov/publicaffairs/press_releases/Ray_Limon_Farewell_Press_Release.pdf. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 22 of 28\nF. Supp. 297, 307 (D.D.C. 1995) (granting declaratory relief to Foreign Service officer illegally \ndismissed without cause), aff’d, 85 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Wilson, \n290 F.3d 347, 362 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (remanding with instructions to enter judgment that plaintiff \nwas “a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights with all the powers, privileges, \nand emoluments thereunto of right appertaining” (quotation marks omitted)).   \nB.  The Court Should Alternatively Grant Mandamus Relief. \nThere is also a long-established Anglo-American history and tradition of courts issuing \nwrits of mandamus in cases of unlawful removals from office.  Because “a request for an \ninjunction” “is essentially a request for a writ of mandamus in this context,” that history confirms \nthat the Court may issue an injunction in this case.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 976 n.1; accord Leopold v. \nManger, 102 F.4th 491, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  And at a minimum, that longstanding Anglo-\nAmerican history and tradition means the Court can grant mandamus relief.  To avoid any doubt \nabout the Court’s remedial power, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court make clear it would \ngrant mandamus in the alternative if equitable relief is somehow not available.   \nThe D.C. Circuit has long recognized the “overwhelming” authority that “[a] mandamus \nto restore” lies where a person removable only for “causes specified” “is wrongfully dispossessed \nof [an] office.”  Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. D.C. 310, 319 (D.C. Cir. 1914) (quoting Rex v. Blooer, \n2 Burr. 1043, 1045 (1760)).  That remedial power has a firm basis in English common law.  See 3 \nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *264-265 (“mandamus” is a “full and \neffectual remedy” “for refusal or admission where a person is intitled to an office” and “for \nwrongful removal, where a person is legally possessed” and “the franchise[] concern[s] the \npublic”); James L. High, A Treatise on Extraordinary Remedies 69–70 (2d ed. 1884) (recognizing \nthat, where officers removable only “ ‘for due cause’ ” are illegally terminated, courts may \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 23 of 28\n“restore” that person “by mandamus . . . to an office to which he is justly entitled”).8   \nThe English tradition crossed the Atlantic and is reflected in American caselaw “from the \nearliest days of the Republic.”  Milton Eisenberg, The Influence of the Writ of Mandamus in \nFederal Personnel Litigation, 45 Geo. L.J. 388, 388 (1957).  Indeed, Marbury v. Madison involved \nan officer whose commission was wrongfully withheld—a circumstance analogous to the wrongful \nattempted removal of an officer.  According to Chief Justice Marshall, that scenario presented “a \nplain case for a mandamus.”  Marbury, 5 U.S. at 173; see also United States v. Malmin, 272 F. \n785, 790 (3d Cir. 1921) (collecting cases) (“[M]andamus is an appropriate remedy to restore to \noffice one lawfully in possession and unlawfully removed.”).9  \nAs we noted at the outset, this long history and tradition provides a powerful indication \nthat injunctive relief is available now, especially in the context of a suit about whether to “comply \nwith removal restrictions,” where the two remedies are “essentially” the same.  Swan, 100 F.3d at \n \n8 See also Oliver Field, Civil Service Law, ch. XI § V (1939) (“Mandamus to reinstate the ousted \nemployee to the position from which he claims to have been illegally separated is probably the \nmost commonly used remedy in civil service removal cases which reach the courts.”); High, supra, \nat 71 (noting, “both in England and America,” that “the power of the civil courts to restore one [to \noffice] who has been wrongfully removed is well established”); Samuel Slaughter Merril, Law of \nMandamus 182 (1892) (“When an officer has been wrongfully removed from his office, he will be \nrestored thereto by the writ of mandamus”); Thomas Tapping, The Law and Practice of the High \nPrerogative Writ of Mandamus 240 (1853) (mandamus “to restore” lies as a “remedy for a \nwrongful dispossession of an office or function which has temporal rights attached to it”); John \nShortt, Informations (Criminal and Quo Warranto), Mandamus and Prohibition 302 (1888) \n(recognizing  that  “mandamus  to  restore”  is  the  “true  specific  remedy”  when  “a  person  is \nwrongfully dispossessed of any office” (quotation marks omitted)).  \n9 See also Macfarland v. U. S. ex rel Russell, 31 App. D.C. 321, 322 (D.C. Cir. 1908) (mandamus \nto compel re-enrollment of plaintiff as a police officer); Truitt v. City of Philadelphia, 70 A. 757, \n761 (Pa. 1908) (mandamus “to reinstate” local superintendent after he was “illegally removed”); \nRansom v. City of Boston, 79 N.E. 823, 823 (Mass. 1907) (mandamus to “reinstate” plaintiff \n“unlawfully ousted” from position with city labor service); Fuller v. Trs. of the Acad. Sch. in \nPlainfield, 6 Conn. 532, 546 (1827) (mandamus to “restore the plaintiff” as a trustee of public \nretirement board); cf. Farley v. U.S. ex rel. Welch, 92 F.2d 533, 539 (D.C. Cir. 1937) (mandamus \nwhere official was unlawfully denied compulsory promotion). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 24 of 28\n976-7 & n.1; Ross v. United States, 460 F. Supp. 2d 139, 150 (D.D.C. 2006) (“It is broadly \nrecognized that a request for relief in the nature of mandamus is no different than a request for a \nmandatory  injunction.”).   The  settled  tradition  of  mandamus  thus  furnishes  support  for  an \ninjunction here.   \nRegardless, the Court can alternatively issue mandamus if an injunction is not available.  \nPlaintiff’s entitlement to relief—supported by centuries of on-point authority—is “clear and \nindisputable.”  Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 381 (2004) (quotation marks \nomitted).  And mandamus is “appropriate” in this circumstance, id., because it would direct the \nnon-presidential  Defendants  to  perform  the  “ministerial”—i.e.,  “not  discretionary”—duty  of \n“abid[ing] by the requirements of duly enacted and otherwise constitutional” removal restrictions.  \nSwan, 100 F.3d at 977; see also id. at 978 (rejecting government’s argument that Congress could \nnot “impose a nonremoval duty of sufficient clarity to create a ministerial duty”). \nC.  The Government’s Counterarguments Are Wrong. \nThe government’s claims that this Court is powerless to issue a remedy strike at the heart \nof the separation of powers and would fundamentally undermine American conceptions of judicial \nreview.  See Marbury, 5 U.S. at 163 (“[W]here there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy \nby suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded.”) (quotation marks omitted).  This Court \nshould reject them. \nFirst, the government recycles its argument (at 13-14) that courts cannot enjoin the \nPresident.  But as the D.C. Circuit just confirmed in Dellinger, “a court can unquestionably review \nthe legality of the President’s action by enjoining the officers who would attempt to enforce the \nPresident’s order.”  2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1; see also Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 352 (1976) \n(plurality op.) (rejecting the argument that “the executive’s responsibility to insure that the laws \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 25 of 28\nbe faithfully executed requires the power of appointment or removal at will, unimpaired by any \njudicial oversight”).  This Court can and should issue an injunction against the President’s \nsubordinates, who are Defendants here.  See Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042-1043; Swan, 100 F.3d at \n980.  \nSecond, the government argues that the “traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction” in \nremoval cases forecloses an injunction.  Gov. Opp. at 15 (quoting inter alia Baker v. Carr, 369 \nU.S. 186, 231 (1962)).  But the cases the government cites demonstrate that, prior to the merger of \nlaw and equity, plaintiffs proceeded in the “courts of law” for this form of relief.  See, e.g., White \nv. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898).  It bears emphasis:  Even the government’s authority recognizes \nthat  meaningful  relief  was  available  at  law,  including  via  mandamus.    Id.  (availability  of \n“mandamus,” among other writs); In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888) (same).  The rigid \nhistoric divide between courts of law and courts of equity has little practical relevance today when \nthe “jurisdiction conferred on the federal courts embraces suits in equity as well as at law.”  Great \nLakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943).10   \nThe long history of mandamus relief also means this case is unlike Grupo Mexicano, on \n \n10 In the Supreme Court in the Dellinger stay application, the government and Justice Gorsuch \nsuggested the plaintiff there should have sought a writ of quo warranto.  Quo warranto is a “quasi \ncriminal” action to determine title to an office brought against the occupant of that office for \nunlawful “usurpation.”  Newman v. U.S. of Am. ex rel. Frizzell, 238 U.S. 537, 544 (1915); Bessent \nv. Dellinger, No. 24A790, 2025 WL 580388, at *2 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025) (Gorsuch J., dissenting).  \nThe government seems to have abandoned the suggestion that a plaintiff like Harris must proceed \nvia quo warranto.  For good reason:  Historically, the writ of quo warranto was appropriate only \nif the dispossessed official could challenge someone currently occupying the office.  Where there \nis no usurper to sue—as in this case—the writ of quo warranto does not lie.  See Osgood v. Jones, \n60 N.H. 282, 288 (N.H. 1880).  Instead, if “there is no adverse claimant in possession” mandamus \nprovided the appropriate remedy.  Public Office—Remedies for Improper Removal—Mandamus—\nQuo Warranto, 38 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 693 (1925).  But if necessary, this Court and subsequent \nappellate courts may read Plaintiff’s request for “all other appropriate relief,” Compl., ECF No. 1 \nat 11, to encompass a request for quo warranto as well.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 980 & n.3 (noting the \nCourt has authority to “amend [the] complaint in this fashion”).    \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 26 of 28\nwhich the government relies.  In Grupo Mexicano, a federal court had sought to order a specific \ntype  of  “relief  that  has  never  been  available  before”  and  was  “specifically  disclaimed  by \nlongstanding judicial precedent.”  Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 \nU.S. 308, 322 (1999).  By contrast, in this case, there is a long history of courts ordering that the \ngovernment respect for-cause removal protections.  Whether one labels that relief legal or equitable \ntoday is largely irrelevant.  The government is also incorrect to assert (at 21-22) that the limits on \nequity jurisdiction preclude declaratory relief.  Declaratory judgments arise “both at law and in \nequity.”  Great Lakes, 319 U.S. at 299 (emphasis added).  Declaratory relief may thus be available \neven if courts would have traditionally lacked equity jurisdiction in this context because courts \nhad the power to issue legal relief in the form of mandamus.  \nThird, the government again argues Harris should seek backpay, while simultaneously \ndisclaiming  a  “backpay-only  rule.”    Gov.  Opp.  at  15,  17  (quotation  marks  omitted).   The \ngovernment protests too much.  It is advancing a backpay-only rule that would render this Court \nimpotent.  At bottom, “the bedrock principle that our system of government is founded on the rule \nof law” would crumble if the President could flout the “terms of legislative enactments” simply by \nwriting a check.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 978.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and the reasons in Plaintiff’s initial memorandum, Plaintiff’s \nmotion should be granted, the Court should enter declaratory relief for Plaintiff, the Court should \norder the proposed permanent injunction submitted by Plaintiff, and the Court should make clear \nthat it would alternatively issue a writ of mandamus.  Plaintiff also respectfully requests that the \nCourt extend the operative TRO if it does not resolve the merits within 14 days of the TRO’s \nentry.   See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(b)(2).    Plaintiff  similarly  respectfully  requests  a  preliminary \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 38     Filed 03/02/25     Page 27 of 28\ninjunction if the TRO dissolves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and the Court has not \nyet issued a decision on the merits. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Jeremy D.

HARRIS \n \n─────────── \n \nAPPLICATION TO STAY THE JUDGMENTS  \nOF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nAND REQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE STAY \n \n─────────── \nPursuant to Rule 23 of the Rules of this Court and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \n1651, the Solicitor General—on behalf of applicants Donald J. Trump, President of \nthe United States, et al., and Scott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury, et al.— \nrespectfully requests that this Court stay the judgments issued by the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia (App., infra, 177a-178a; id. at 216a-217a) pending \nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and any further proceedings \nin this Court.  The Solicitor General also respectfully requests an administrative stay \nof those judgments while this Court considers this application.  \nThis case raises a constitutional question of profound importance:  whether the \n(1) \n\n2 \nPresident can supervise and control agency heads who exercise vast executive power \non the President’s behalf, or whether Congress may insulate those agency heads from \npresidential control by preventing the President from removing them at will.  Here, \nsoon after taking office, President Trump removed respondents from the National \nLabor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  Re-\nlying on statutes that purport to insulate members of those agencies from removal, \nthe district court countermanded the President’s decisions and ordered respondents \nrestored to their offices.  Although a panel of the D.C. Circuit stayed those orders, the \nen banc court vacated the stay, allowing respondents to continue exercising the Pres-\nident’s executive power over the President’s express objection.   \nThis situation is untenable.  “Under our Constitution, the ‘executive Power’—\nall of it—is ‘vested in a President,’ who must ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.’”  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).  “The President’s power \nto remove—and thus supervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf fol-\nlows from the text of Article II, was settled by the First Congress, and was confirmed \nin the landmark decision Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926).”  Ibid.  This \nCourt has “recognized only two exceptions to the President’s unrestricted removal \npower,” and it has declined to “extend these precedents to a new configuration.”  Ibid.   \nThis “unrestricted removal power,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203, lies at the heart \nof Article II.  The President’s “ ‘power to remove—and thus supervise—those who \nwield executive power on his behalf,’ ” stands among his “core constitutional powers.”  \nTrump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 606, 608 (2024) (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 204).  It is “conclusive and preclusive,” and thus untouchable by Congress.  Id. at \n607 (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 638 (1952) (Jack-\nson, J., concurring)).   \n \n\n3 \nHumphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), does not dictate a \ncontrary result as to members of the MSPB and NLRB.  That case recognized a nar-\nrow exception to the President’s removal power that, properly construed, extends only \nto “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.”  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 218 (emphasis added).  The NLRB and MSPB do wield substantial \nexecutive power in implementing and enforcing federal labor and civil-service laws.  \nThe lower courts protested that they were bound to follow Humphrey’s Executor until \nit is overruled, but they were also bound to follow Seila Law’s more recent, definitive \nexposition of Humphrey’s Executor.  In reading Humphrey’s Executor more broadly, \nthe en banc court and district court ignored this Court’s admonitions that Humphrey’s \nExecutor “ ‘represent[s] what up to now ha[s] been the outermost constitutional limi[t] \nof permissible congressional restrictions on the President’s removal power’ ” over prin-\ncipal officers, and that it should not be “elevate[d]  * * *  into a freestanding invitation \nfor Congress to impose additional restrictions.”  Id. at 218, 228.  Indeed, the district \ncourt frankly acknowledged that its reading of Article II was “Contra Seila L.”  App., \ninfra, 168a n.19.  \nFurther, the district court’s orders violate Article II on an independent and \nequally troubling basis.  Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equita-\nble authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the President has \nremoved and to force the President to rely on principal officers whom the President \nbelieves should not be exercising any executive power.  Exercising non-existent equi-\ntable  authority  to  saddle  the  President  with  already-removed  principal  officers \n“deeply wounds the President” in his exercise of the executive power.  Morrison v. \nOlson, 487 U.S. 654, 713 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).    \nSuch reinstatement orders find no support in our jurisprudence.  Executive \n \n\n4 \nofficers have traditionally challenged their removal by suing for back pay, not by \nseeking reinstatement—as Humphrey’s Executor itself illustrates.  Until this Admin-\nistration, no court had ever ordered the reinstatement of a concededly executive of-\nficer removed by the President.  See Bessent v. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 517 (2025) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  Indeed, this Court has squarely held that a “court of equity” \nhas no power to “restrain an executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a \nsubordinate appointee.”  White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (citation omitted).  \nThe en banc court and district court thus inexplicably hewed to an overbroad reading \nof Humphrey’s Executor that this Court has jettisoned, while ignoring the remedial \naspect of Humphrey’s Executor that should have guided their decisions.  \nAs these cases demonstrate, allowing district courts to reinstall agency heads \nin the Executive Branch against the President’s will causes grave and irreparable \nharm to the President and to our Constitution’s system of separated powers.  In firing \nrespondent Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB, the President explained that Wilcox had \nnot “been operating in a manner consistent with the [Administration’s] objectives,” \nthat she had issued decisions that “have vastly exceeded” the NLRB’s authority, that \nhe lacked confidence that she could “fairly evaluate matters” before the NLRB or that \nshe would “faithfully execute” the statute.  Wilcox Compl. Ex. A, at 2-3.  Likewise, \nafter the President fired respondent Cathy Harris from the MSPB, Harris obtained \nreinstatement from a district court and then overturned the Executive Branch’s firing \nof thousands of other federal employees, disrupting the President’s efforts to reform \nthe federal workforce.  The President should not be forced to delegate his executive \npower to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the Administration’s policy \nobjectives for a single day—much less for the months that it would likely take for the \ncourts to resolve this litigation.  \n \n\n5 \nThis Court should stay the district court’s judgments.  Given the urgency and \nimportance of these issues, the government also respectfully requests that the Court \ntreat this application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment and \npromptly settle the questions presented.  The Court should also grant an administra-\ntive stay pending its consideration of this application.   \nSTATEMENT \nA.  Wilcox  \n1.  Congress established the NLRB in the National Labor Relations Act of \n1935 (NLRA), ch. 372, 49 Stat. 449.  The NLRB consists of five members appointed \nby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  See 29 U.S.C. 153(a).  \nMembers serve five-year terms and, under the Act, “may be removed by the President, \nupon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other \ncause.”  Ibid.  The President “designate[s] one member to serve as Chairman.”  Ibid.   \nThe NLRB has broad power to execute the Act’s provisions.  For instance, the \nNLRB’s General Counsel brings, and the NLRB adjudicates, actions claiming that \nemployers or unions have engaged in unfair labor practices.  See 29 U.S.C. 153(d), \n160.  The NLRB may award remedies such as “back pay,” “reinstatement,” and other \nrelief that “will effectuate the policies” of the statute.  29 U.S.C. 160(c).  The NLRB \nalso has the power to issue “rules and regulations” to carry out the Act.  29 U.S.C. \n156.  The NLRB may authorize its General Counsel to file petitions in courts of ap-\npeals to enforce its orders, see 29 U.S.C. 160(e), and suits in district court to enjoin \nunfair labor practices, see 29 U.S.C. 160( j).  Its factual findings are “conclusive” “if \nsupported by substantial evidence.”  29 U.S.C. 160(e). \n2.  In 2021, President Biden, with the advice and consent of the Senate, \nappointed respondent Gwynne Wilcox to the NLRB.  See Wilcox Compl. ¶ 12.  In 2023, \n \n\n6 \nPresident Biden appointed Wilcox to a second term.  See App., infra, 148a.   \nOn January 27, 2025, a week after taking office, President Trump removed \nWilcox as an NLRB member.  See App., infra, 148a.  The Deputy Director of the White \nHouse Office of Presidential Personnel emailed Wilcox a letter on behalf of the Pres-\nident.  See Wilcox Compl. Ex. A.  In the letter, the President stated that the NLRB \n“is not presently fulfilling its responsibility to the American people”; that “[t]he aims \nand purposes of the Administration with respect to the work on the Board can be \ncarried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection”; and that Wilcox \n“ha[d] not, in my judgment, been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives \nof my administration.”  Id. at 2.  The President observed, for example, that Wilcox \nhad “adopted a host of decisions that have improperly cabined employers’ right to \nspeak on the subject of unionization, raising serious First Amendment concerns”; that \n“[s]everal such decisions were issued on the eve of the new Administration”; and that \nWilcox had “also issued decisions that, in my judgment, have vastly exceeded the \nbounds of the National Labor Relations Act.”  Id. at 2-3.  The President therefore \n“lack[ed] confidence” that Wilcox “can fairly evaluate matters before [the NLRB] \nwithout unduly disfavoring the interests of employers.”  Id. at 3.  The President also \n“lack[ed] confidence that [Wilcox] will faithfully execute” the statute.  Ibid. \n3.  Days later, Wilcox sued the President and the NLRB Chairman in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  See App., infra, 149a.  She claimed \nthat her removal violated her statutory tenure protection and sought judicial relief \nrestoring her to office.  See ibid.  \nOn March 6, the district court granted summary judgment to Wilcox, rejecting \nthe government’s argument that NLRB members’ statutory tenure protection violates \nArticle II.  App., infra, 141a-176a.  The court read Humphrey’s Executor v. United \n \n\n7 \nStates, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), as establishing “the constitutionality of removal protec-\ntions [for] independent, multimember boards.”  App., infra, 152a.  The court also \nstated that the Executive Branch is not “strictly unitary”; that the President’s re-\nmoval power “has never been viewed as unrestricted”; that this Court’s opinion in \nMyers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) was “unreliable,” “inapposite,” and “prolix”; \nand that Humphrey’s Executor is “consistent with the text and historical understand-\nings of Article II.”  App., infra, 162a-164a, 167a, 168a (capitalization omitted).   \nThe district court issued a declaratory judgment that Wilcox’s removal was \n“unlawful” and “null and void”; that she “remains a member” of the NLRB; and that \nshe “may be removed by the President” only in accordance with the statutory removal \nrestriction.  App., infra, 177a-178a.  The court also issued a permanent injunction \nprohibiting the NLRB Chairman from “in any way treating [Wilcox] as having been \nremoved from office, from impeding in any way her ability to fulfill her duties as a \nmember of the NLRB, and from denying or obstructing her authority or access to any \nbenefits or resources of her office.”  Id. at 178a.  The court rejected the government’s \nargument that courts lack the power to issue equitable relief restoring removed exec-\nutive officials.  See id. at 173a n.22.   \nThe government appealed to the D.C. Circuit.  The district court denied the \ngovernment’s motion for a stay pending appeal.  See App., infra, 137a-140a.  \nB.  Harris \n1.  Congress established the MSPB in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 \n(CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111.  The MSPB consists of three members, \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  See 5 U.S.C. \n1201.  No more than two members may belong to the same political party.  See ibid.  \nMembers serve seven-year terms and, according to the Act, “may be removed by the \n \n\n8 \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  5 U.S.C. \n1202(d); see 5 U.S.C. 1202(a).  The President, with the advice and consent of the Sen-\nate, “from time to time appoint[s]” one of the members as Chairman.  5 U.S.C. 1203(a).   \nThe MSPB adjudicates federal employees’ challenges to adverse employment \nactions.  See 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(1).  It also adjudicates proceedings brought by the Office \nof Special Counsel, including disciplinary proceedings against federal employees who \nhave allegedly violated federal civil-service laws.  See 5 U.S.C. 1215(a).  The MSPB \nmay, in addition, review and invalidate rules issued by the Office of Personnel Man-\nagement, an agency that oversees the federal workforce.  See 5 U.S.C. 1204(f ).  And \nthe MSPB may send its own attorneys to litigate civil actions in the lower federal \ncourts.  See 5 U.S.C. 1204(i).  \n2.  In 2022, President Biden, with the advice and consent of the Senate, \nappointed respondent Cathy Harris to the MSPB.  See App., infra, 184a.  In 2024, \nPresident Biden, with the advice and consent of the Senate, designated Harris as \nChairman.  See ibid.  On February 10, 2025, the Deputy Director of the White House \nOffice of Presidential Personnel sent Harris an email stating: “On behalf of President \nDonald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems \nProtection Board is terminated, effective immediately.  Thank you for your service.”  \nIbid. (citation omitted).   \n3.  The next day, Harris sued the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe MSPB’s Acting Chairman, and several White House officials in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia.  See Harris Compl. ¶¶ 8-13.  She claimed that her \nremoval violated her statutory tenure protection and sought immediate judicial relief \nrestoring her to office.  See App., infra, 185a.  \nOn February 18, the district court issued a temporary restraining order rein-\n \n\n9 \nstating Harris.  App., infra, 218a-238a.  Although the statute purports to grant tenure \nprotection only to MSPB members and does not restrict a member’s removal from the \noffice of Chairman, see 5 U.S.C. 1202(b), the TRO directed that Harris “shall continue \nto serve as Chairman of the MSPB,” App., infra, 239a.  \nOn March 4, the district court vacated the TRO and granted Harris summary \njudgment—this time restoring Harris only as a member, not as Chairman.  App., \ninfra, 181a-215a.  The court read Humphrey’s Executor as establishing the validity of \ntenure protections for “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial \nexecutive power.”  Id. at 190a (citation omitted).  The court stated that the MSPB \n“ ‘does not wield substantial executive power, but rather spends nearly all of its time \nadjudicating ‘inward-facing personnel matters’ involving federal employees.”  Id. at \n192a (brackets and citation omitted).  The court further concluded that “the MSPB’s \nmission and purpose require independence.”  Id. at 193a.   \nThe district court issued a declaratory judgment that Harris “remains a mem-\nber” of the MSPB and that she “may be removed by the President” only in accordance \nwith the statutory removal provision.  App., infra, 216a.  The court also issued a per-\nmanent injunction prohibiting the defendants other than the President from “in any \nway treating [Harris] as having been removed without cause, denying or obstructing \nHarris’s access to any of the benefits or resources of her office, placing a replacement \nin Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other person as a member of the \nMerit Systems Protection Board in Harris’s position.”  Id. at 217a.  The court rejected \nthe government’s argument that it lacked the power to issue equitable relief restoring \nremoved executive officials.  See id. at 196a-214a.   \nThe government appealed to the D.C. Circuit.  The district court denied the \ngovernment’s motion for a stay pending appeal.  App., infra, 179a-180a.  \n \n\n10 \nC.  D.C. Circuit Proceedings \n1.  A motions panel of the D.C. Circuit stayed the district court’s judgments \nin Wilcox and Harris pending appeal.  App., infra, 23a-136a.  Each member of the \npanel issued a separate opinion.   \nJudge Walker voted to stay the district court’s judgments.  App., infra, 25a-\n72a.  He recognized that Humphrey’s Executor “carved out an exception” to the Pres-\nident’s removal power “for agencies that wield ‘no part of the executive power,’ ” but \nobserved that this Court has since “severely narrowed” that decision and has “forbid-\nden extensions of Humphrey’s to any new contexts.”  Id. at 42a, 54a (citation omitted).  \nHe explained that the government was likely to succeed in showing that the NLRB \nand MSPB fall outside the exception recognized in Humphrey’s Executor because both \nagencies exercise substantial executive power.  See id. at 55a-67a.  He also concluded \nthat “the President suffers irreversible harm each day the district courts’ injunctions \nremain in effect” and that respondents’ harms “are either incognizable or outweighed \nby the irreparable harm suffered by the Government.”  Id. at 67a, 69a.  \nJudge Henderson, too, voted to stay the district court’s judgments.  App., infra, \n73a-82a.  Although Judge Henderson found the government’s likelihood of success on \nthe merits “a somewhat closer call” than did Judge Walker, she ultimately agreed \nthat the President has the power to remove NLRB and MSPB members “because of \nthe substantial executive power that the [agencies] both wield.”  Id. at 78a.   She also \nconcluded that “the government has more than satisfied its burden to show irrepara-\nble harm that far outweighs any harm to [respondents] from a stay.”  Ibid.  \nJudge Millett dissented.  App., infra, 83a-136a.  In Judge Millett’s view, this \nCourt’s precedents “squarely foreclose” the contention that the President may remove \nNLRB and MSPB members at will.  Id. at 89a.  Judge Millett also rejected the gov-\n \n\n11 \nernment’s argument that the district court’s judgments exceeded the courts’ remedial \nauthority, see id. at 123a-128a, and concluded that the equities did not support a \nstay, see id. at 128a-136a.  \n2.  By a vote of 7-4, the en banc court of appeals vacated the panel’s stay.  \nApp., infra, 1a-18a.  The court read this Court’s precedent to establish the lawfulness \nof  “removal  restrictions  for  governmental  officials  on  multimember  adjudicatory \nboards.”  Id. at 2a.  By a vote of 6-5, the court also denied the government’s request \nto stay the vacatur of the panel’s order for seven days to give the government time to \nseek relief from this Court.  See id. at 3a.   \nChief Judge Srinivasan agreed with the en banc court’s vacatur of the panel’s \nstay but would have granted the government’s request to stay that vacatur for seven \ndays.  App., infra, 3a n.*.  Judge Henderson issued a dissenting opinion in which she \nstated that “[o]nly the Supreme Court can decide the dispute”—“the sooner, the bet-\nter.”  Id. at 5a.  Judge Rao, joined by Judges Henderson, Katsas, and Walker, issued \na dissent in which she agreed that the President’s removal of respondents was lawful \nand argued that the district court’s orders exceeded its remedial authority.  Id. at 6a-\n16a.  Judge Walker, joined by Judge Henderson, issued a dissenting opinion agreeing \nwith the en banc majority that lower courts are bound by this Court’s precedents, but \nexplaining that he disagreed with the majority’s reading of those precedents.  Id. at \n17a-18a. \nARGUMENT \nUnder Rule 23 of the Rules of this Court and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, \nthe Court may stay a district court’s judgment pending review in the court of appeals \nand in this Court.  See, e.g., McHenry v. Texas Top Cop Shop, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 1 (2025).  \nTo obtain such relief, an applicant must show a likelihood of success on the merits, a \n \n\n12 \nreasonable probability of obtaining certiorari, and a likelihood of irreparable harm.  \nSee Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam).  In “close cases,” \n“the Court will balance the equities and weigh the relative harms.”  Ibid.  Those fac-\ntors overwhelmingly support a stay here.   \nA.  The Government Is Likely To Succeed On The Merits \nThe most critical stay factor is usually the applicant’s likelihood of success on \nthe merits, see Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024), and here, that likelihood is \nhigh.  First, this Court’s precedents establish that Article II empowers the President \nto remove, at will, members of multimember boards that wield substantial executive \npower, such as the NLRB and MSPB.  Second, the Court’s precedents also establish \nthat district courts lack the power to issue injunctions or declaratory judgments coun-\ntermanding the President’s removal of executive officers. \n1.  Article II empowers the President to remove NLRB and MSPB \nmembers at will \na.  Article II vests the “executive Power” in the President and directs him \nto “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. Art. II, § 1, Cl. 1; id. \n§ 3.  The executive power “generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the \nagents who wield executive power in his stead.”  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n197, 238 (2020).  The President’s power to remove executive officers whom he has \nappointed “follows from the text of Article II,” “was settled by the First Congress,” \nand has been “confirmed” by this Court many times.  Ibid.; see Trump v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 593, 621 (2024); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 250-256 (2021); Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 213-232; Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 577, 492-508 \n(2010); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 108-176 (1926).  The President’s removal \npower is “ ‘conclusive and preclusive,’ ” meaning that it “may not be regulated by Con-\n \n\n13 \ngress or reviewed by the courts.”  Trump, 603 U.S. at 620-621.  \nThis Court’s precedents have recognized only “two exceptions” to the “general \nrule” of “unrestricted removal”:  one for certain principal officers in Humphrey’s Ex-\necutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and one for certain “inferior officers with \nlimited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 215.  Those exceptions “represent what up to now have been the outermost consti-\ntutional limits of permissible congressional restrictions on the President’s removal \npower.”  Id. at 218 (citation omitted).  Because everyone agrees that NLRB and MSPB \nmembers are principal officers, only the Humphrey’s Executor exception is pertinent \nhere.  \nIn Humphrey’s Executor, this Court upheld a statute that protected members \nof the New Deal-era Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from removal except for “inef-\nficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  295 U.S. at 620 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n41).  In reaching that conclusion, the Court explained that Congress’s authority to \nrestrict the removal of an officer “will depend upon the character of the office.”  Id. at \n631.  “Because the Court limited its holding ‘to officers of the kind here under consid-\neration,’ ” “the contours of the Humphrey’s Executor exception depend upon the char-\nacteristics of the agency before the Court.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215 (quoting \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632).  “Rightly or wrongly, the Court viewed the \nFTC (as it existed in 1935) as exercising ‘no part of the executive power.’ ”  Ibid. (quot-\ning Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628).  The Court instead regarded the 1935 \nFTC as a “legislative” or “judicial” “aid”—an entity that acted “as a legislative agency” \nby “making investigations and reports thereon for the information of Congress,” and \n“as an agency of the judiciary” by making recommendations to courts “as a master in \n \n\n14 \nchancery.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628.1 \nThis Court has therefore read Humphrey’s Executor to hold only that Congress \ncould “give for-cause removal protections to a multimember body of experts, balanced \nalong partisan lines, that performed legislative and judicial functions and was said \nnot to exercise any executive power.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.  The Court has also \nexplained that the “exceptio[n]” recognized in Humphrey’s Executor’s encompasses \nonly “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.”  \nId. at 218; see id. at 239 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[T]he \nCourt takes a step in the right direction by limiting Humphrey’s Executor to ‘multi-\nmember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.’ ”) (emphasis \nin original; citation omitted). \nTo the extent Humphrey’s Executor requires upholding tenure protections for \nagencies such as the NLRB and MSPB, the government intends to ask this Court to \nhold,  after  receiving  full  briefing  and  argument,  that  Humphrey’s  Executor was \nwrongly decided, is not entitled to stare decisis effect, and should be overruled.  See \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 239-251 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in \npart).  For purposes of this application, however, the government’s narrower reading \nof Humphrey’s Executor—and the ensuing conclusion that the agency heads at issue \nhere must be removable at will—follows the holding of Seila Law and warrants a stay \npending further review.   \nb.  Unlike the 1935 FTC as understood by Humphrey’s Executor, the NLRB \n \n1  This Court has since recognized that Humphrey’s Executor may have misap-\nprehended the 1935 FTC’s powers and may have misclassified those powers as quasi-\nlegislative or quasi-judicial rather than executive.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216 \nn.2, 219 n.4.  This Court has explained, however, that it will “take the decision on its \nown terms.”  Id. at 219 n.4.  “[W]hat matters is the set of powers [Humphrey’s Execu-\ntor] considered as the basis for its decision, not any latent powers that the agency \nmay have had not alluded to by the Court.”  Ibid.   \n \n\n15 \nand MSPB do not simply make reports to Congress or recommendations to courts.  \nEach  agency  instead  exercises  executive  power—indeed,  “substantial  executive \npower.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  Then-Judge Kavanaugh accordingly included \nboth the NLRB and the MSPB on a list of “agencies exercising substantial executive \nauthority.”  PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 173 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (en banc) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., dissenting).   Each agency thus falls outside the Humphrey’s Executor \nexception—and within the “general rule” that the President may remove executive \nofficers at will.  Id. at 215. \nNLRB.  The NLRB exercises substantial executive power in executing the \nNLRA, a major federal statute that regulates private-sector industrial relations.  See \nApp., infra, 55a-61a (Walker, J., concurring).  To begin, the NLRB adjudicates ad-\nministrative enforcement actions against employers or unions accused of unfair labor \npractices.  See 29 U.S.C. 160(a)-(c).  As part of that process, the NLRB may issue \nsubpoenas requiring witnesses to produce evidence and provide testimony.  See 29 \nU.S.C. 161.  The statute empowers the NLRB not only to order a violator to “cease \nand desist” from the practice, but also to award “reinstatement,” “back pay,” or other \nremedies that “will effectuate the policies” of the statute.  29 U.S.C. 160(c).  Further, \nthe NLRB may, and often does, use its adjudications as “vehicles for the formulation \nof agency policies” that govern the conduct of employers and unions.  NLRB v. Bell \nAerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974) (citation omitted).  The NLRB also adjudi-\ncates proceedings relating to union representation; among other things, it identifies \nthe appropriate bargaining unit, decides whether to hold elections to certify or decer-\ntify unions, and administers such elections.  See 29 U.S.C. 159.  The NLRB’s adjudi-\ncatory authority amounts to substantial executive power.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n219-220 (agency exercised “significant executive power” by “awarding legal and equi-\n \n\n16 \ntable relief in administrative adjudications”); City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, \n305 n.4 (2013) (agency adjudication is an exercise of executive power).   \nThe NLRB, in addition, has the power to make “rules and regulations” “to carry \nout the provisions” of the NLRA.  29 U.S.C. 156.  The Wilcox district court claimed \nthat the NLRB “hardly engages in rulemaking,” App., infra, 156a, but that is incor-\nrect.  In fact, when firing Wilcox, the President noted that she had “supported a new \njoint employer rule” that “vastly exceeded the bounds” of the statute and that “courts \nthen invalidated.”  Wilcox Compl. Ex. A, at 3.2  In any event, what matters is the \nagency’s power, not how often the agency chooses to exercise it.  An agency’s power \nto make rules to carry out a federal statute is substantial executive power.  See Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 218, 220 (agency exercised “significant executive power” because it \ncould “promulgate binding rules” implementing federal statutes); Arlington, 569 U.S. \nat 305 n.4 (agency rulemaking is an exercise of executive power).  \nThe NLRB, finally, may file suits asking district courts to enjoin unfair labor \npractices.  See 29 U.S.C. 160( j).  Although the NLRB General Counsel represents the \nagency in such judicial proceedings, it is the NLRB members who authorize the ini-\ntiation of the proceedings.  See ibid.  The power to seek remedies “against private \nparties on behalf of the United States in federal court” is “a quintessentially executive \npower not considered in Humphrey’s Executor.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219; see Buck-\nley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138 (1976) (per curiam) (“A lawsuit is the ultimate remedy \nfor a breach of the law, and it is to the President  * * *  that the Constitution entrusts \nthe responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’ ”) (quoting U.S. \n \n2  See Standard for Determining Joint Employer Status, 88 Fed. Reg. 73,946 \n(Oct. 27, 2023) (rule changing the definition of “joint employer”); Chamber of Com-\nmerce of United States v. NLRB, 723 F. Supp. 3d 498 (E.D. Tex. 2024) (holding the \nrule unlawful). \n \n\n17 \nConst. Art. II, § 3).   \nMSPB.  The MSPB, similarly, exercises substantial executive power in execut-\ning laws governing the federal workforce.  See App., infra, 61a-67a (Walker, J., con-\ncurring).  To start, it exercises extensive adjudicatory power.  It reviews federal em-\nployees’ appeals from adverse employment actions, such as firings, suspensions, and \nfurloughs, see 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(1), 7701, and may “order any Federal agency or em-\nployee to comply with” its decision, 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2).  The MSPB also reviews pro-\nceedings brought by the Office of Special Counsel, including disciplinary proceedings \nseeking civil penalties or other sanctions against employees who have allegedly vio-\nlated civil-service laws.  See 5 U.S.C. 1215(a).  In conducting adjudications, the MSPB \nmay issue subpoenas directing witnesses to produce evidence or provide testimony.  \nSee 5 U.S.C. 1204(b)(2)(A).  Those are all substantial executive powers.  \nThe MSPB also may review and invalidate regulations issued by the Office of \nPersonnel Management, see 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(4), and may send its own attorneys to \nrepresent it in the lower federal courts “in any civil action brought in connection with \nany function carried out by the Board,” 5 U.S.C. 1204(i).  The MSPB’s authority to \nveto another executive agency’s exercise of executive power is itself a significant ex-\necutive power.  Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 967-968 (1983) (White, J., dissent-\ning) (discussing the importance of the power to veto agency action).  As discussed \nabove, the power to litigate cases in district court on behalf of the federal government \nis likewise a core executive power.  See p. 16, supra.  \nAggravating the constitutional problem, MSPB members may exercise some of \nthe Board’s powers unilaterally.  For instance, a single member may, at the request \nof the Special Counsel, stay any personnel action for 45 days.  See 5 U.S.C. 1214(b).  \nIn fact, after being fired by the President and reinstated by the district court, Harris \n \n\n18 \nunilaterally reinstated thousands of employees who had been fired by the Depart-\nment of Agriculture.  See p. 34, infra.  That unilateral authority further distinguishes \nthis case from Humphrey’s Executor, which involved an agency member whose exer-\ncise of power could be “check[ed]” by “fellow members.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  \nc.  The contrary arguments of the lower courts and respondents lack merit.   \nFirst, the district court’s opinion in Wilcox contradicts Seila Law.  Even though \nSeila Law recognized that Article II vests the “entire ‘executive Power’ ” in “the Pres-\nident alone,” 591 U.S. at 213, the district court stated that “the executive branch [i]s \nnot  * * *  strictly unitary,” App., infra, 163a-164a.  Even though Seila Law viewed \nthe First Congress’s debates over removal as “contemporaneous and weighty evi-\ndence” that “the executive power include[s] a power to oversee executive officers \nthrough removal,” 591 U.S. at 214 (citations omitted), the district court concluded \nthat those debates “did not make clear” whether the President’s removal power “de-\nrived from the Constitution,” App., infra, 163a.  Even though Seila Law relied on the \n“exhaustive examination” of the removal power in this Court’s “landmark decision” \nin Myers, 591 U.S. at 204, 214, the district court dismissed Myers as “unreliable,” \n“prolix,” and “inapposite,” App., infra, 164a, 167a.  Even though Seila Law recognized \na “general rule” of “unrestricted removal,” 591 U.S. at 215, the district court rejected \nas “misguided” the argument that Article II grants the President an “ ‘unrestricted \nremoval power,’ ” App., infra, 162a (citation omitted).  And the district court stated \nthat Humphrey’s Executor could not be “fairly described as an ‘exception’ to the gen-\neral rule of presidential removal authority,” while acknowledging that such a reading \nwas “Contra Seila L.”  Id. at 168a n.19. \nThe district court’s analysis in Harris is likewise flawed.   The court empha-\nsized that the MSPB regulates government activity rather than that “the conduct of \n \n\n19 \nprivate parties.”  App., infra, 192a.  But an agency’s execution of a federal statute \ndoes not somehow become less executive because the statute concerns government \nemployees rather than private individuals.  To the contrary, the hiring and firing of \nemployees in the Executive Branch is itself an important aspect of executive power.  \nSee Constitutionality of Proposed Regulations of Joint Committee on Printing, 8 Op. \nO.L.C. 42, 49 n.7 (1984) (“Each branch of the Federal Government can conduct the \nhiring and firing of employees within that branch.”).  The court also stated that “the \nMSPB’s mission and purpose require independence.”  App., infra, 193a.  But this \nCourt has repeatedly rejected arguments made in dissent that Congress may restrict \nthe President’s power to remove an executive officer based on a particular agency’s \nperceived need for independence.  See, e.g., Collins, 594 U.S. at 285 (Sotomayor, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“require a degree of independence”); Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 264 (Kagan, J., concurring in the judgment with respect to severa-\nbility and dissenting in part) (“a feature of that agency its creators thought funda-\nmental to its mission—a measure of independence from political pressure”); Free En-\nterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 531 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“particular need for independ-\nence”).  In any event, the MSPB’s statutory precursor, the Civil Service Commission, \nfulfilled substantially the same mission without tenure protection for almost a cen-\ntury before the creation of the MSPB in 1978.  See Act of Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, § 1, 22 \nStat. 403 (1883).   \nThe en banc D.C. Circuit’s analysis, too, was unsound.  The court emphasized \nthat the NLRB and MSPB are “multimember” bodies.  App., infra, 3a.  But Seila Law \ncorrectly read Humphrey’s Executor to address only “multimember expert agencies \nthat do not wield substantial executive power,” not multimember agencies in general.  \n591 U.S. at 218 (emphasis added).  The en banc court also invoked Wiener v. United \n \n\n20 \nStates, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), a case in which this Court held that members of the War \nClaims Commission—a temporary body that distributed money from a compensation \nfund—were not removable at will.  App., infra, 2a.  But the NLRB and MSPB are \npermanent rather than temporary bodies, and their powers are far more substantial \nthan the War Claims Commission’s—and are plainly executive in nature.  Finally, \nthe D.C. Circuit described the NLRB and MSPB as “adjudicatory” entities.  App., \ninfra, 3a.  But that description overlooks the NLRB’s power to make rules, the \nMSPB’s power to block rules, and both agencies’ power to litigate cases in court.  See \npp. 16-17, supra.  Regardless, agency adjudications “are exercises of—indeed, under \nour constitutional structure they must be exercises of—the ‘executive Power.’ ”  Ar-\nlington, 569 U.S. at 304 n.4 (citation omitted); see SEC v. Jarkesy, 603 U.S. 109, 172 \nn.2 (2024) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“An executive official properly vested with the \nauthority to find facts, apply the law to those facts, and impose the consequences \nprescribed by law exercises executive power.”); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. \n868, 909 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (agency \nadjudicators “exercise the executive power”).3 \n2.  A court lacks the power to issue equitable relief restoring a \nremoved executive officer \nThis Court need not resolve broader questions about Humphrey’s Executor to \n \n3  Insofar as the 1935 FTC had adjudicatory powers of its own, Humphrey’s \nExecutor did not expressly address those powers when upholding the agency’s inde-\npendence, 295 U.S. at 628, and thus is not precedent sustaining removal protections \nin that regard, see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219 n.4.  Moreover, the NLRB’s and MSPB’s \nadjudicatory powers far exceed the 1935 FTC’s.  For instance, while the 1935 FTC \ncould order violators only to cease and desist from unlawful activity, see Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 620, the NLRB may in addition direct violators to take “affirm-\native action” and may impose monetary remedies such as “back pay,” 29 U.S.C. 160.  \nAnd while the 1935 FTC had to ask a court to enforce its orders, see Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 620-621, the MSPB may enforce its own orders, see 5 U.S.C. \n1204(a)(2) and (e)(2)(A). \n \n\n21 \ndecide this stay application.  The Court can also grant the application on the narrow, \nindependent ground that the government is likely to show that the district court’s \nremedies of reinstating agency heads were unlawful.  See App., infra, 6a-16a (Rao, \nJ., dissenting); see also Bessent v. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 516-518 (2025) (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting) (voting to stay a district court’s reinstatement of removed Special \nCounsel Hampton Dellinger on the ground that the court exceeded its remedial au-\nthority); Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *14-*15 (D.C. Cir. \nFeb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) (same).   \nTraditionally, removed executive officers (or their executors) have challenged \ntheir removal by seeking back pay—not injunctions or declaratory judgments restor-\ning them to office.  See, e.g., Wiener, 357 U.S. at 350; Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. \nat 618; Myers, 272 U.S. at 106; Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 318 (1903); \nParsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, 327 (1896); United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. \n483, 483 (1886).  This practice exists for good reasons.  Such an injunction or decla-\nration violates Article II, lacks clear statutory authorization, exceeds federal courts’ \nequitable powers, create serious practical problems, and represents an abuse of dis-\ncretion.   \na.  A court violates Article II by ordering the restoration of an executive \nofficer removed by the President.  The President’s removal power is “ ‘conclusive and \npreclusive,’ ” which means that it “may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by \nthe courts.”  Trump, 603 U.S. at 620-621 (emphasis added).  Although Humphrey’s \nExecutor held that Congress may sometimes restrict the removal power by statute, \nthis Court has never held that courts may restrain the removal of executive officers \nthrough injunctions or declarations.  Permitting judicial reinstatement orders would \ninvolve a substantial extension of Humphrey’s Executor, which involved only back \n \n\n22 \npay.  A back-pay order requires the Executive Branch only to pay a sum of money; a \nreinstatement order, by contrast, compels the President to entrust his executive \npower to someone he has fired.   \nReinstatement suits also needlessly entangle courts in political disputes, for \ninstance by forcing them to judge whether the equities and the public interest support \nallowing removals to take effect.  See, e.g., App., infra, 211a (questioning whether “the \npublic interest would be better served by removing Harris from her position”).  “There \nis no need to magnify the separation-of-powers dilemma posed by the headless Fourth \nBranch * * * by letting Article III judges—like jackals stealing the lion’s kill—expro-\npriate some of the power that Congress has wrested away from the unitary Execu-\ntive.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 525-526 (2009) (Scalia, J.). \nHistory confirms that a court may not force the President to retain the services \nof an executive officer whom he no longer trusts with executive power.  Many mem-\nbers of the First Congress argued against requiring the Senate’s advice and consent \nfor removals precisely because of the risk that such a procedure would require the \nPresident to retain someone he had sought to remove.  Representative Benson ob-\nserved that, “[i]f the Senate, upon its meeting, were to acquit the officer, and replace \nhim in his station, the President would then have a man forced on him whom he \nconsidered as unfaithful.”  Myers, 272 U.S. at 124 (citation omitted).  Representative \nBoudinot similarly argued: “But suppose [the Senate] shall decide in favor of the of-\nficer, what a situation is the President then in, surrounded by officers with whom, by \nhis situation, he is compelled to act, but in whom he can have no confidence.”  Id. at \n131-132 (citation omitted).  And Representative Sedgwick asked rhetorically:  “Shall \na man under these circumstances be saddled upon the President, who has been ap-\npointed for no other purpose than to aid the President in performing certain duties?  \n \n\n23 \nShall he be continued, I ask again, against the will of the President?”  Id. at 132 \n(citation omitted).  If the Senate may not saddle the President with an unwanted \nexecutive officer, a district court certainly may not do so. \n“Perhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with \nthe” district court’s remedy “is the lack of a historical precedent for [it].”  Free Enter-\nprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 505 (citation omitted).  We are unaware of any previous case, \nbefore this Administration took office, in which a court restrained the President’s re-\nmoval of a principal officer who concededly wields executive power.  See Dellinger, \n145 S. Ct. at 517 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting); Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *14 (Katsas, \nJ., dissenting).  At most, a district court in 1983 effectively reinstated removed mem-\nbers of the multimember U.S. Commission on Civil Rights because that court believed \nthat the commission functioned as a “legislative agency” whose “ ‘only purpose’ ” was \n“to find facts which [could] subsequently be used as a basis for legislative or executive \naction”—not to exercise any executive power in its own right.  Barry v. Reagan, No. \n83-cv-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *2 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983).  That is no support for the \nextraordinary and intrusive remedies issued here. \nb.  The district court’s remedies in these cases also lacked clear statutory \nauthorization.  This Court’s precedents require “an express statement by Congress” \nto authorize judicial remedies that could burden the President’s exercise of Article II \npowers.  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801 (1992); see id. at 800-801 (lack \nof clear statement subjecting presidential action to judicial review under the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.); Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 748 \nn.27 (1982) (lack of clear statement subjecting the President to a damages remedy).  \nRelatedly, the Court’s precedents require “very clear and explicit language” before \nassuming  that  Congress  has  sought  to  burden  the  President’s  removal  power.  \n \n\n24 \nShurtleff, 189 U.S. at 315; see Collins, 594 U.S. at 248.  Respondents, however, have \nidentified no statutory provision that provides—much less clearly—that courts may \nrestore Board members whom the President has removed without cause.   \nIf anything, the relevant statutes imply that courts may not grant such relief.  \nCongress has enacted a Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. 5596, under which wrongfully fired \nofficials may seek back pay, but it has never enacted a Reinstatement Act under \nwhich principal executive officers may seek restoration to office.  The “express provi-\nsion” of one type of remedy “suggests that Congress intended to preclude others.”  Al-\nexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 290 (2001).  In addition, the NLRA and CSRA \nboth authorize the reinstatement of employees whose firings violate the statutes’ sub-\nstantive provisions.  See 5 U.S.C. 7118(a)(7)(C) (authorizing the Federal Labor Rela-\ntions Authority (FLRA) to require the “reinstatement” of employees as a remedy for \nunfair labor practices by agencies); 29 U.S.C. 160(c) (authorizing the NLRB to order \n“reinstatement of employees” as a remedy for unfair labor practices by private em-\nployers).  Yet neither statute expressly authorizes the reinstatement of a Board mem-\nber whose firing violates the relevant tenure provisions.  “That is significant because \nCongress generally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another.”  DHS v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 391 (2015). \nc.  In addition, the injunctions and declaratory judgments issued in these \ncases exceed the district court’s equitable powers.  Federal courts derive their equi-\ntable powers from the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 73.  See Grupo Mexicano \nde Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318 (1999).  They must \nexercise those powers in accordance with “traditional principles of equity jurisdic-\ntion,” as understood at the Founding.  Id. at 319 (citation omitted).  They may award \nonly those equitable remedies that were “traditionally accorded by courts of equity,” \n \n\n25 \nand they may not “create remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence.”  Id. \nat 319, 332; accord Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021).   \nOne of the most well-established principles of equity jurisprudence is that a \ncourt may not enjoin the removal of an executive officer.  For instance, in White v. \nBerry, 171 U.S. 366 (1898), this Court reversed an injunction preventing the removal \nof a federal revenue officer who had been appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury.  \nThe Court explained that “a court of equity will not, by injunction, restrain an exec-\nutive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain \nthe appointment of another.”  Id. at 377 (citation omitted).  Similarly, in In re Sawyer, \n124 U.S. 200 (1888), the Court held that a federal court lacked the power to enjoin \nthe removal of a municipal officer.  It is “well settled,” the Court explained, “that a \ncourt of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public offic-\ners.”  Id. at 212.  The Court has reaffirmed those principles in many other cases.  See \nBaker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962); Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. \n487, 490 (1924); Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898).   \nThat principle is longstanding and well established.  “No English case has been \nfound of a bill for an injunction to restrain [an] appointment or removal.”  Sawyer, \n124 U.S. at 212.  State courts have “denied” the “power of a court of equity to restrain  \n* * *  removal” in “many well-considered cases.”  Ibid.  One 19th-century scholar \nwrote that “[n]o principle of the law of injunctions, and perhaps no doctrine of equity \njurisprudence, is more definitely fixed or more clearly established than that courts of \nequity will not interfere by injunction to determine questions concerning the appoint-\nment of public officers or their title to office.”  2 James L. High, Treatise on the Law \nof Injunctions § 1312, at 863 (2d ed. 1880).  The injunctions in these cases flout that \nprinciple. \n \n\n26 \nThat principle forecloses declaratory relief as well.  A declaratory-judgment \nsuit is “essentially an equitable cause of action.”  Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70 \n(1971) (citation omitted). Because the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201-\n2202, empowers a district court to enforce a declaratory judgment through “[f ]urther \nnecessary or proper relief,” 28 U.S.C. 2202, a declaratory judgment can “serve as the \nbasis for a subsequent injunction,” Samuels, 401 U.S. at 72.  “[E]ven if the declaratory \njudgment is not used as a basis for actually issuing an injunction, the declaratory \nrelief alone has virtually the same practical impact as a formal injunction would.”  \nIbid.  As a result, “the same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an in-\njunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining \nwhether to issue a declaratory judgment.”  Id. at 73.  Because “an injunction” to re-\nstrain the removal of an executive officer “would be impermissible,” “declaratory re-\nlief should  * * *  be denied as well.”  Ibid.; see Macauley v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 327 \nU.S. 540, 545 n.4 (1946) (“The same principles which justified dismissal of the cause \ninsofar as it sought injunction justified denial of the prayer for a declaratory judg-\nment.”); Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 300 (1943) (The \nDeclaratory Judgment Act “only provided a new form of procedure for the adjudica-\ntion of rights in conformity” with “established equitable principles.”).   \nThe declaratory judgments here suffer from an additional flaw.  Just as a court \n“has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President,” Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. \n475, 501 (1867), a court also “cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the Presi-\ndent,” Franklin, 505 U.S. at 827 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment).  See Newdow v. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“With re-\ngard to the President, courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him  * * *  and have \nnever submitted the President to declaratory relief.”).  Although the district court’s \n \n\n27 \ninjunctions here ostensibly run against defendants other than the President, the de-\nclaratory judgments, on their face, run against the President himself.  The Wilcox \njudgment declares that “the termination of plaintiff Gwynne A. Wilcox”—an action \ntaken by the President—“was unlawful” and “therefore null and void.”  App., infra, \n177a.  And the Wilcox and Harris judgments both declare that respondents “may be \nremoved by the President” only for cause.  Id. at 178a, 216a (emphasis added). \nd.  Court orders reinstating fired executive officers create serious practical \nproblems as well.  To start, reinstatement orders can “lead to the utmost confusion in \nthe management of executive affairs.”  White, 171 U.S. at 378.  Here, for example, \nrespondents were removed by the President, reinstated by the district court, removed \nagain by virtue of the panel’s decision, and reinstated again by the en banc court.  \nHarris’s career trajectory is even more confusing; the district court at first reinstated \nher as MSPB Chairman but later reinstated her only as a member.  See p. 9, supra.   \nAnd respondents’ status may change yet again after the merits panel or this Court \nissues a final decision.  Judicial  intervention has thus thrown the NLRB’s and \nMSPB’s operations into chaos, cast a cloud on the lawfulness of the agencies’ actions, \nleft the President and Senate uncertain about whether and when they may install \nnew officers to succeed respondents, and undermined “the steady administration of \nthe laws” that Article II seeks to secure.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 223 (citation omitted).  \nRespondents’ remedial theory also encourages hasty judicial decisionmaking.  \nRemoved officers may seek temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, \nand other forms of emergency relief immediately restoring them to office.  See, e.g., \nApp., infra, 239a-240a (TRO in Harris).  And courts may feel pressure to rush to final \njudgment, lest they prolong the uncertainty about the lawfulness of the removal.  See, \ne.g., C.A. 3/18/25 Order (setting expedited briefing schedule under which briefing will \n \n\n28 \nbe completed on April 11, 2025); App., infra, 177a-178a (district court’s final judgment \nin Wilcox one day after the hearing); id. at 216a-217 (same in Harris).  Such fast-\npaced litigation deprives courts of the opportunity for careful deliberation and creates \na serious risk of judicial error.  See id. at 239a-240a (TRO wrongly reinstating Harris \nas Chairman, overlooking a lack of statutory tenure protection for the chairmanship).  \nFinally,  reinstatement  suits  threaten  to  “embroi[l]  the  federal  courts”  in \n“power contest[s] nearly at the height of [their] political tension.”  Raines v. Byrd, 521 \nU.S. 811, 833 (1997) (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment).  By inviting courts to \nrestore officers immediately after the President has fired them, such suits raise the \n“specter of judicial readiness to enlist on one side of a political tug-of-war” and “risk \ndamaging  the  public  confidence  that  is  vital  to  the  functioning  of  the  Judicial \nBranch.”  Id. at 833-834; see id. at 827 (majority opinion) (“[I]f the federal courts had \nentertained an action to adjudicate the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act \nimmediately after its passage in 1867, they would have been improperly and unnec-\nessarily plunged into the bitter political battle being waged between the President \nand Congress.”).  A back-pay suit, by contrast, alleviates those concerns by providing \n“some greater separation in the time between the political resolution and the judicial \nreview.”  Id. at 834 (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment).   \ne.  At a minimum, the remedies here represent an abuse of discretion.  “The \ndecision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion.”  \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).  Similarly, because the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act provides that a court “may” grant declaratory relief, 28 \nU.S.C. 2201(a), courts possess “substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare \nthe rights of litigants,” Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 286 (1995).   \nFor the reasons discussed above, injunctive or declaratory relief reinstating a \n \n\n29 \nremoved executive officer raises serious constitutional, legal, and practical concerns.  \nThose concerns are especially acute when, as here, this Court has not yet rendered a \nfinal decision definitively resolving the lawfulness of the removal.  In light of those \nconcerns, the prudent exercise of equitable discretion requires, at a minimum, that \nthe President’s removal decisions remain in effect while litigation remains ongoing.  \nCf. Myers, 272 U.S. at 123-125 (even those members of the First Congress who be-\nlieved that the removal of executive officers required Senate consent agreed that the \nPresident could suspend the officers pending the Senate’s final decision). \nf.  In both Wilcox and Harris, the district court reasoned that courts have \nhistorically had the power to restore removed officers by issuing writs of quo warranto \nand mandamus.  See App., infra, 173a n.22; 212a-214a.  But quo warranto and man-\ndamus are legal remedies, while injunctions and declarations are equitable remedies.  \nThe legal remedies come with crucial safeguards that the equitable remedies lack.  \nFirst, Congress has authorized quo warranto actions with respect to any “pub-\nlic office of the United States” “within the District of Columbia.”  D.C. Code § 16-\n3501.4  But a plaintiff must satisfy stringent requirements before he may bring such \nan action.  A plaintiff must first ask the Attorney General or U.S. Attorney to sue, \nand those officials have “broad discretion” to refuse to do so.  Andrade v. Lauer, 729 \nF.2d 1475, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see D.C. Code §§ 16-3501 to 16-3502.  If those offi-\ncials refuse, the plaintiff may ask a court for leave to sue, “but the court, too, has \nbroad discretion to deny the writ.”  Andrade, 729 F.2d at 1498; see D.C. Code § 16-\n3503.  By seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, respondents bypassed those pro-\ncedural safeguards.  \n \n4  Although the relevant provision is codified in the D.C. Code, it was enacted \nby Congress.  See District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of \n1970, Pub. L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 561. \n \n\n30 \nMandamus, too, comes with essential guardrails.  “Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 81(b) abolished the writ of mandamus in the district courts, but relief ‘in the \nnature of mandamus’ may still be obtained through an appropriate action.”  Sanchez-\nEspinoza v. Reagan, 770 F.2d 202, 207 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, J.) (quoting 28 \nU.S.C. 1361).  “The principles that governed the former writ now govern attempts to \nsecure similar relief.”  Ibid.  Under those principles, a court may award mandamus \nonly if the applicant has a “clear and indisputable” right to relief.  United States ex \nrel. Bernardin v. Duell, 172 U.S. 576, 582 (1899); see Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, \n616 (1984).  For the reasons discussed above, respondents’ right to relief is, at a min-\nimum, unclear.  See pp. 12-20, supra.  In addition, while this Court has approved the \nuse of mandamus to try the title to judicial or local offices, we are unaware of any \nprecedent for using mandamus to reinstate an executive officer removed by the Pres-\nident.  See Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 256 (1839) (court clerk); Marbury v. Madi-\nson, 1 Cranch 137, 168 (1803) (justice of the peace in the District of Columbia). \nThe district court suggested in Wilcox that, because of “the merger of law and \nequity,” the distinction between a writ of mandamus and an injunction no longer \n“makes [a] difference.”  App., infra, 173a n.22.  But the merger of law and equity \nmeans only that, instead of using different forms of action and procedural rules for \n“actions at law” and “cases in equity,” courts now use “one form of civil action and \nprocedure for both.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 advisory committee’s note.  The merger “did not \nalter” the “ ‘substantive principles’ ” governing the availability of relief.  Grupo Mexi-\ncano, 527 U.S. at 322 (citation omitted); see Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lock Po, 336 \nU.S. 368, 382 n.26 (1949) (“Notwithstanding the fusion of law and equity by the Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the substantive principles of Courts of Chancery remain unaf-\nfected.”).  One such substantive principle, as explained above, precludes courts from \n \n\n31 \nenjoining allegedly wrongful removals or ordering reinstatement as a remedy.  \nThe district court in Harris, meanwhile, relied principally on this Court’s deci-\nsion in Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974).  App., infra, 201a-202a.  But Sampson \nrecognized at most that courts may, in some cases, grant “injunctive relief to dis-\ncharged federal employees.”  415 U.S. at 78 (emphasis added); see App., infra, 12a n.3 \n(Rao, J., dissenting).  It did not overrule this Court’s precedents precluding injunctive \nrelief for discharged “officers.”  White, 171 U.S. at 376 (emphasis added).  And even \nunder Sampson, courts must apply a heightened standard before awarding injunctive \nrelief to discharged government employees—a standard that must account for the \nExecutive Branch’s “latitude in the ‘dispatch of its own internal affairs.’ ”  415 U.S. at \n83 (emphasis added).  Respondents have not satisfied even the ordinary test for in-\njunctive relief, let alone Sampson’s heightened standard. \nB.  The Other Factors Support Relief From The District Court’s Orders \nIn  deciding  whether  to  grant  emergency  relief,  this  Court  also  considers \nwhether the underlying issues warrant review, whether the applicant likely faces \nirreparable harm, and, in close cases, the balance of equities.  See Hollingsworth, 558 \nU.S. at 190.  Those factors overwhelmingly support relief here.   \n1.  The issues raised by these cases warrant this Court’s review \nThe question whether the President may remove NLRB and MSPB members \nat will warrants this Court’s review.  This Court has often granted certiorari to review \nthe validity of restrictions on the President’s power to remove executive officers.  See \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 236; Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 209; Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 488.  The Court also has been appropriately receptive to reviewing cases where, as \nhere, “[t]he Executive Branch, at its highest level, is seeking the aid of the courts to \nprotect its constitutional prerogatives.”  Cheney v. United States District Court, 542 \n \n\n32 \nU.S. 367, 385 (2004); see Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 689-690 (1997) (“The repre-\nsentations made on behalf of the Executive Branch as to the potential impact of the \n[decision below] merit our respectful and deliberate consideration.”).   \nThe remedial question, too, warrants this Court’s review.  As discussed above, \ncourt orders reinstating removed executive officers raise grave separation-of-powers \nconcerns.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  And this Court has often granted certiorari to resolve \nimportant questions concerning the extent of the lower courts’ remedial authority.  \nSee, e.g., Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 548 (2022); Monsanto Co. v. \nGeertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149 (2010); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 423 \n(2009); Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).   \nIn addition, the “interim status” of the removals—that is, whether respondents \nmay continue to exercise executive power “while the parties wait for a final merits \nruling”—“itself raises a separate question of extraordinary significance.”  Labrador v. \nPoe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 929 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  Since the beginning of \nthis Administration, multiple executive officers removed by the President—an NLRB \nmember, an MSPB member, a member of the FLRA, two FTC members, and inspec-\ntors general across multiple agencies—have challenged their removal in court.  See \nGrundmann v. Trump, No. 25-cv-425, 2025 WL 782665 (D.D.C. Mar. 12, 2025); \nSlaughter v. Trump, No. 25-cv-909 (D.D.C. filed Mar. 27, 2025); Storch v. Hegseth, \nNo. 25-cv-415 (D.D.C.) (heard Mar. 27, 2025).  The litigation in those cases in the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals, and this Court may well last more than a year—\ni.e., more than a quarter of the President’s four-year term.  This Court, not the lower \ncourts, should decide whether the President should be required to continue employing \nthe removed officers in their offices during that period.  \n \n\n33 \n2.  The  district  court’s  restoration  of  respondents  to  office \ncauses irreparable harm to the Executive Branch \nThe district court’s judgments cause extraordinary and irreparable harm to the \nPresident, in whom the Constitution vests “all of ” “the ‘executive Power.’ ”  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 203 (quoting Art. II, § 1, Cl. 1).  The district court is forcing the President \nto continue allowing respondents to exercise executive power as principal officers, \neven though the President has removed respondents.  “That level of interference is \nvirtually unheard of, and it impinges on the conclusive and preclusive power through \nwhich the President controls the Executive Branch that he is responsible for super-\nvising.”  App., infra, 47a-48a (Walker, J., concurring) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  That sort of harm—to the Executive Branch, to the separation of powers, \nand to our democratic system—is manifestly irreparable. \nThat is not merely “an abstract constitutional injury”; “it is a serious, concrete \nharm.”  App., infra, 68a (Walker, J., concurring).  With Wilcox, the NLRB would have \ntwo Democratic members, one Republican member, and two vacancies.  With Harris, \nthe MSPB would have one Democratic member, one Republican member, and one \nvacancy.  Compelling the President to work with an executive agency that is dead-\nlocked or controlled by the opposing political party—especially during the critical \nearly months of his administration—irreparably impairs his ability to implement his \nagenda.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225 (recognizing the harm that a President suf-\nfers if he has “saddled with a holdover [officer] from a competing political party who \nis dead set against [his] agenda”) (emphasis omitted).   \nThe President’s stated reasons for firing Wilcox underscore the irreparable \nharm caused by her reinstatement.  The President has determined that the NLRB “is \nnot presently fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,” that Wilcox has not \n \n\n34 \n“been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of [the] administration,” \nthat she has “adopted a host of decisions that have improperly cabined employers’ \nrights to speak on the subject of unionization,” and that she has issued decisions that \nhave “vastly exceeded the bounds” of the NLRA.  Wilcox Compl. Ex. A, at 2-3.  The \nPresident accordingly “lack[s] confidence” that Wilcox “can fairly evaluate matters \nbefore [her] without unduly disfavoring the interests of employers” and that she “will \nfaithfully execute” the NLRA.  Id. at 3.  Compelling the President to entrust executive \npower to an officer in whom he has lost confidence plainly inflicts irreparable harm.  \n“The moment [the President] loses confidence” in a principal executive officer, “he \nmust have the power to remove him without delay.”  Myers, 272 U.S. at 134.   \nSo too, Harris’s conduct since her removal illustrates how her court-ordered \nreinstatement has irreparably harmed the Executive Branch.  Earlier this year, \nHampton Dellinger, a Special Counsel who had been removed by the President but \nreinstated by a district court, sought a stay of the firing of roughly 6000 employees at \nthe Department of Agriculture.  See App., infra, 68a (Walker, J., concurring).   Harris, \nan MSPB member who had been fired by the President but reinstated by a district \ncourt, unilaterally granted the requested stay.  See Order on Stay Request at 2, Spe-\ncial Counsel ex rel. John Doe v. Department of Agriculture, No CB-1208-25-20-U-1 \n(MSPB Mar. 5, 2025).  Although the Department of Agriculture “filed an opposition \nto the stay request,” Harris “d[id] not consider these additional submissions” because \nshe believed that the applicable statute “does not provide an opportunity for agency \ncomment on an initial stay request.”  Id. at 2 n.3.  In other words, a fired MSPB \nmember and a fired Special Counsel together undid the firing of thousands of federal \nemployees, all without giving the affected executive agency an opportunity even to \ncomment.  As that episode illustrates, court-ordered reinstatement of fired executive \n \n\n35 \nofficers can enable those officers to thwart the elected President’s agenda from within \nthe Executive Branch.  \nThe district court’s judgments also threaten irreparable harm to the NLRB and \nMSPB.  In Collins, this Court recognized that private persons may be entitled to ju-\ndicial relief when an unconstitutional removal restriction “inflict[s] compensable \nharm.”  594 U.S. at 259.  For instance, if “the President had attempted to remove [an \nagency head] but was prevented from doing so by a lower court decision,” the removal \nrestriction “would clearly cause harm” to affected persons.  Ibid.  By blocking the \nPresident’s removal of NLRB and MSPB members, the district court has arguably \nexposed every action by those agencies to legal challenge.  The prospect of mass in-\nvalidation of everything done by the NLRB and MSPB during respondents’ court-\nordered tenures provide a further reason to grant immediate relief. \n3.  The balance of equities favors a stay \nStaying the district court’s judgments would not cause any irreparable harm \nto respondents.  Although respondents’ removal deprives them of their employment \nand salary, such harms ordinarily are not considered irreparable, “however severely \nthey may affect a particular individual.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68.  A court can \nredress such harms by awarding back pay at the end of the case.  \nThe district court found that respondents’ firings irreparably harmed them by \ndepriving Wilcox of her ability “to carry out [her] congressional mandate in protecting \nlabor rights,” App., infra, 170a, and Harris of her ability “to pursue her ‘statutory \nmission’ to protect employees,” id. at 209a (citation omitted).  That reasoning is un-\nsound.  Although a public official’s “loss of salary” amounts to a judicially cognizable \nharm, his “loss of political power” does not.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 820.  The notion that \npublic officials “have a separate private right, akin to a property interest, in the pow-\n \n\n36 \ners of their offices” is “alien to the concept of a republican form of government.”  \nBarnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Bork, J., dissenting).  At bottom, \nrespondents’ claim to irreparable injury from their inability to continue wielding ex-\necutive power is precisely the problem.  Executive power belongs to the President, not \nto respondents. \nJudge Millett also emphasized that Wilcox’s and Harris’s firings deprive the \nNLRB and MSPB of quorums.  See App., infra, 131a.  But that harm is not irrepara-\nble.  For example, the President and Senate can address it by nominating and con-\nfirming new members.  The President also could properly conclude that it is better to \nleave the NLRB or MSPB temporarily without a quorum than to entrust executive \npower to officers in whom he lacks confidence.  And if this Court ultimately concludes \nthat respondents’ firings were lawful, actions taken by the agencies in the meantime \nmight need to be unwound anyway.  See p. 35, supra.  In sum, the irreparable harm \ncaused by the district court’s judgments “far outweighs any harm to Harris and Wil-\ncox from a stay.”  App., infra, 78a (Henderson, J., concurring).  \nC.  This Court Should Grant Certiorari Before Judgment \nRegardless of whether this Court grants a stay, it should construe this appli-\ncation as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment and grant review of the \nfollowing questions:  (1) whether 29 U.S.C. 153(a) violates the separation of powers \nby prohibiting the President from removing a member of the National Labor Rela-\ntions Board except for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office”; (2) whether 5 U.S.C. \n1202(d) violates the separation of powers by prohibiting the President from removing \na member of the Merit Systems Protection Board except for “inefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office”; and (3) whether the district court’s orders restoring \nrespondents to office exceeded the court’s remedial authority.   \n \n\n37 \nThese cases satisfy the demanding criteria for certiorari before judgment:  \nThey are “of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal \nappellate practice and to require immediate determination in this Court.”  Sup. Ct. \nR. 11.  As discussed above, members of four multimember agencies—the NLRB, \nMSPB, FLRA, and FTC—have brought suits in federal district court challenging their \nremovals and seeking reinstatement to office.  See p. 32, supra.  No matter which \nparty prevails in the lower courts, this Court would likely ultimately grant review.  \nBut until the Court issues a final decision, the agencies will operate under a cloud of \nlegal uncertainty and will risk legal challenges to any actions that they take.  See p. \n35, supra.  The President, the agencies, and the public thus all have a strong interest \nin obtaining, as speedily as possible, a definitive judicial resolution of the dispute.   \nOn the other side of the ledger, there would be little benefit to postponing this \nCourt’s review until after the D.C. Circuit issues its final decision.  The district court \nin each case has already issued an opinion resolving the merits; the D.C. Circuit stay-\npanel members have issued three separate opinions spanning 114 pages; Judge Rao \nissued a further opinion at the en banc stage exploring the remedial issue; and the en \nbanc D.C. Circuit has already signaled that it will rule in respondents’ favor.  On top \nof all that, the scope of the President’s removal power is a fundamental question of \nconstitutional law that has been thoroughly discussed in this Court, in the lower \ncourts, and in the academy.  Because the harms of further delay so plainly outweigh \nthe benefits, the Court should grant certiorari before judgment.  \nEspecially if this Court does not grant this stay application, it should also order \nexpedited briefing and hold oral argument in a special May sitting this Term.  If the \nCourt instead defers a decision until next Term, the NLRB, MSPB, FLRA, and FTC \nmight all remain under a legal cloud until 2026, and the President might be forced to \n \n\n38 \ncontinue entrusting executive power to fired officers for more than a quarter of his \nfour-year term.  We acknowledge the concerns surrounding litigating and deciding \nthe important questions raised by these cases on such a short timeline, see pp. 27-28, \nsupra, but respondents’ decision to seek (and the district court’s decisions to grant) \nreinstatement rather than back pay leaves no workable alternative.  As Judge Hen-\nderson correctly observed, “[o]nly [this] Court can decide the dispute,” and “the \nsooner” it does so, “the better.”  App., infra, 5a.   \nD.  This Court Should Issue An Administrative Stay While It Considers \nThis Application \nThe government respectfully requests an administrative stay of the district \ncourt’s judgments while it considers this application.  The government “will suffer \nirreparable harm each day the President is deprived of the ability to control the ex-\necutive branch.”  App., infra, 25a (Walker, J., concurring).  Experience shows that a \nfired principal executive officer can wreak significant damage on the President’s au-\nthority if allowed to remain in office for even a few days.  See p. 34, supra (discussing \nhow fired MSPB member Harris and fired Special Counsel Dellinger undid the firings \nof thousands of other federal employees).  And the longer respondents continue to \nexercise executive power over the President’s objection, the greater the number of \nNLRB and MSPB actions that would be vulnerable to legal challenge once this Court \nconfirms the lawfulness of respondents’ removal.   \nFive members of the en banc D.C. Circuit—Chief Judge Srinivasan and the \nfour dissenters—would have granted the government an administrative stay.  See \nApp., infra, 3a-4a n.*-** (noting that Chief Judge Srinivasan and the four dissenters \nwould have granted an administrative stay).  An administrative stay would enable \nthis Court to consider this important application in an orderly manner.  An adminis-\n \n\n39 \ntrative stay of the district court’s unprecedented judgments also is warranted in light \nof “the high respect that is owed to the office of the Chief Executive,” “a matter that \nshould inform the conduct of the entire proceeding.”  Cheney, 542 U.S. at 385 (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  \nCONCLUSION \nIn both Wilcox and Harris, this Court should stay the judgment of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia pending the resolution of the government’s \nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and pending any proceedings \nin this Court.  The Court should also construe this application as a petition for a writ \nof certiorari before judgment and grant the petition.  Finally, the Solicitor General \nrespectfully requests an administrative stay of the district court’s judgments pending \nthe Court’s consideration of this application.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nD.

United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Wiener v.\nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld removal\nrestrictions for government officials on multimember adjudicatory boards.  While two\nlaws governing removal restrictions for single heads of agencies exercising executive\npolicymaking and enforcement powers have been held unconstitutional, see Seila Law\nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly stated that it was not overturning the precedent established in\nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener for multimember adjudicatory bodies.  Instead, the\nSupreme Court has, in its own words, left that precedent “in place[.]”  Seila Law, 591\nU.S. at 215 (2020); see id. at 228 (“not revisit[ing] Humphrey’s Executor”); Collins, 594\nU.S. at 250–251 (2021) (recognizing that Seila Law did “not revisit [] prior decisions”)\n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204); see also Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 687\n(1988) (in case involving restrictions on removal of an inferior officer, recognizing that\nHumphrey’s Executor remains good law); see generally Free Enter. Fund v. Public Acct.\nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (in case involving multimember board,\ndeclining to “reexamine” Humphrey’s Executor); id. at 501 (“[W]e do not * * * take issue\nwith for-cause limitations in general[.]”).\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant\nSupreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it.  If\na precedent of the Supreme Court “has direct application in a case,” lower courts\n“‘should follow the case which directly controls,’” leaving to the Supreme Court “‘the\nprerogative of overruling its own decisions.’”  Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S.\n122, 136 (2023) (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490\nU.S. 477, 484 (1989)).  That rule governs “even if the lower court thinks the precedent\nis in tension with ‘some other line of decisions.’”  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 (quoting\nRodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at 484); see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237\n(1997) (“We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, that other courts should conclude\nour more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier precedent.”).\nCircuit precedent compels the same result.  See, e.g., National Security Archive\nv. CIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“This Court is charged with following\ncase law that directly controls a particular issue[.]”); Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 54\n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237); Sierra Club v. E.P.A., 322 F.3d\n718, 725 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at 484).\nPage 2\n\n3a\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5037 September Term, 2024\nThe Supreme Court’s repeated and recent statements that Humphrey’s Executor\nand Wiener remain precedential require denying the government’s emergency motions\nfor a stay pending appeal.  The government, in fact, has acknowledged a lack of clarity\nin the law.  See Oral Arg. Tr. 24:25–25:3 (“I’m not saying that [the Supreme Court has\nbeen] clear.”); 10:24–11:5 (“[T]he Supreme Court has left the lower courts in something\nof a tough spot[.]”); 84:16–23 (There is, “at a minimum, a very substantial question” and\n“reasonable minds can differ” about the scope of Humphrey’s Executor today.);\n88:17–18 (“[T]here’s some uncertainty” in the wake of Collins.).  In addition, at both\nparties’ request, the court has set a highly expedited schedule for the merits of these\nappeals that will allow the cases to be resolved in short order.\nWe hereby vacate the March 28, 2025 order staying the district courts’ final\njudgments and permanent injunctions in these cases.  In light of the precedent in\nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener concerning multimember adjudicatory bodies, the\ngovernment’s motions for a stay pending appeal are denied.  The government has not\ndemonstrated the requisite “strong showing that [it] is likely succeed on the merits” of\nthese two appeals.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The government\nlikewise has not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that\nthere is no available remedy for Harris or Wilcox, or that allowing the district court's\ninjunctions to remain in place pending appeal is impermissible.  See Panel Order\nGranting Stay at  41-46 (Millett, J., dissenting).  Nor has it demonstrated irreparable\ninjury because the claimed intrusion on presidential power only exists if Humphrey’s\nExecutor and Wiener are overturned.  See Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356 (“[N]o such power”\nto remove a predominantly adjudicatory board official “is given to the President directly\nby the Constitution[.]”); Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.  It is\nFURTHER ORDERED that the request for a 7-day stay be denied.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk\nBY: /s/\nLaura M. Morgan\nDeputy Clerk\n* Chief Judge Srinivasan fully joins this order, but he would grant the government’s request to\nstay this order for 7 days to permit the government to seek relief from the Supreme Court.\nPage 3\n\n4a\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5037 September Term, 2024\n** Circuit Judges Henderson, Katsas, Rao, and Walker dissent from this order, and they would\nalso grant the government’s request to stay this order for 7 days to permit the government to\nseek relief from the Supreme Court.  Separate dissenting statements of Circuit Judges\nHenderson, Rao, and Walker are attached.  Circuit Judges Henderson, Katsas, and Walker join\nin the statement of Circuit Judge Rao.  Circuit Judge Henderson joins in the statement of Circuit\nJudge Walker.\nPage 4\n\n5a\nKAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \n  We  do  the  parties  (especially  a  functioning  executive \nbranch) no favors by unnecessarily delaying Supreme Court \nreview of this significant and surprisingly controversial aspect \nof Article II authority.  Only the Supreme Court can decide the \ndispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better. \n\n6a\nRAO, Circuit Judge, dissenting: President Donald Trump \nremoved two principal officers wielding significant executive \npower: Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board and \nGwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board. The \ndistrict court held the removals were unlawful and imposed \nunprecedented and far reaching injunctions, ordering cabinet \nsecretaries and other Executive Branch officials to treat Harris \nand Wilcox as if they were never removed. A panel of this court \nwisely stayed those orders pending appeal. A majority of the \nen banc court now vacates the panel’s order and denies the stay \npending appeal.  \nThe  government  raises  two  independent  grounds  for \ngranting a stay. The en banc majority briefly discusses the first: \nthe lawfulness of the President’s removal of these officers. In \nmy  view,  a  stay  is  warranted  on  this  ground.  But  even \naccounting for disagreement as to the continuing validity of \nHumphrey’s Executor, the district court’s remedial overreach \nindependently justifies a stay. Because the majority denies the \nstay, it should have explained why the government is not likely \nto  prevail  on  its  argument  that  the  injunctions  exceed  the \ncourt’s equitable authority. Instead, the order devotes a single \nsentence to this question, likely because these remedies have \nno historical basis and put the courts on a collision course with \nthe President over his exercise of core executive power. I \nrespectfully dissent. \n* * *\nAs to the constitutional question, the government is likely \nto  succeed  because  the  President’s  removal  of  Harris  and \nWilcox falls within his Article II authority. The Constitution \nvests all executive power in a single President. U.S. CONST. art. \nII, § 1. The President has both the power and the responsibility \nto  supervise  and  direct  Executive  Branch  officers.  Id.  § 3 \n(requiring  the  President  to  “take  Care  that  the  Laws  be \nfaithfully  executed”).  To  carry  out  this  responsibility,  the \n\n7a\n2 \nPresident must be able to remove officers at will. “Since 1789, \nthe Constitution has been understood to empower the President \nto  keep … officers  accountable—by  removing  them  from \noffice,  if  necessary.”  Free  Enter.  Fund  v.  Pub.  Co.  Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (citing Myers v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)); see also Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2191 (2020) (explaining that without \nthe  removal  power  “the  President  could  not  be  held  fully \naccountable for discharging his own responsibilities”) (cleaned \nup).  \nThe en banc majority urges that we must continue to \nfollow Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 \n(1935), and Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), \nwhich held Congress may impose limits on the President’s \nability  to  remove  officers  of  some  so-called  independent \nagencies.  Although  those  cases  have  not  been  formally \noverruled, a series of  recent Supreme Court decisions has \nsubstantially eroded them, as Judge Walker explained. See \nHarris v. Bessent, No. 25-5037, 2025 WL 980278, at *7–13 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 28, 2025) (Walker, J., concurring); see also id. \nat *21–23 (Henderson, J., concurring) (concluding “reasonable \nminds can—and often do—disagree about the ongoing vitality \nof the Humphrey’s exception”). Under Article II, “[t]he buck \nstops with the President,” and he “therefore must have some \npower of removing those for whom he cannot continue to be \nresponsible.” Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 493 (cleaned up). \nWhile statutes provide for-cause removal protections for Harris \nand  Wilcox,  these  restrictions  are  likely  unconstitutional \nbecause they interfere with the President’s authority to remove \nprincipal officers who execute the law.  \nI will not elaborate on these points in this posture, as the \ndisagreement about the scope of the President’s removal power \nwas discussed at length in the panel opinions granting the stay. \n\n8a\n3 \n* * *\nThat brings us to the second ground for granting a stay \npending  appeal:  the  district  court’s  expansive  and \nunprecedented injunctions. Since the panel majority granted \nthe stay on constitutional grounds, it had no need to evaluate \nthe likelihood the government would succeed on its challenge \nto the injunctive remedies. See Harris, 2025 WL 980278, at *2 \nn.10 (Walker, J., concurring). The en banc majority, however,\nis denying the stay and therefore should at least have explained\nwhy the government’s challenge to the remedy fails. Even if\nthe majority is right that Harris and Wilcox were unlawfully\nremoved under current Supreme Court precedent, there is a\nwholly separate question of whether reinstatement, effectuated\nby enjoining scores of Executive Branch officials, is the proper\nremedy.\nIn its rush to vacate the panel’s stay and get Harris and \nWilcox back to work, the en banc majority essentially ignores \nthis question and assumes Harris and Wilcox may be restored \nto their offices through a judicially imposed fiction—namely, \ninjunctions  directing  agency  officials  to  treat  Harris  and \nWilcox as though they remain in office. \nThe district court’s injunctions present difficult and novel \nquestions about the remedial authority of the Article III courts \nin the context of the President’s exercise of his Article II \npowers. See  Dellinger  v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL \n559669, at *12 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) \n(noting the “extraordinary character” of an order “direct[ing] \nthe President to recognize and work with an agency head whom \nhe has already removed”). The government is likely to succeed \non  its  remedial  challenge  because  the  injunctive  relief \nconcocted by the district court is wholly unprecedented and \ntransgresses historical limits on our equitable authority. \n\n9a\n4 \nIt is worth recounting the broad sweep of the injunctions \nimposed here. Harris and Wilcox are no longer in office. The \ndistrict court purported to reinstate these officers by simply \ndeclaring  they  were  never  removed  in  the  first  place  and \nordering Executive Branch officials to play along. For Wilcox, \nthe district court ordered the Chairman of the NLRB “and his \nsubordinates,  agents,  and  employees”  to  refrain  “from \nremoving [Wilcox] from her office without cause or in any way \ntreating [Wilcox] as having been removed from office, from \nimpeding in any way her ability to fulfill her  duties as  a \nmember of the NLRB, and from denying or obstructing her \nauthority or access to any benefits or resources of her office.” \nWilcox  v.  Trump,  No.  25-334,  2025  WL  720914,  at  *18 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025) (emphasis added). It further ordered \nthese same officials to provide Wilcox access to government \nfacilities  and  equipment  to  carry  out  her  duties.  Id.  The \ninjunction  for  Harris  is  similarly  novel,  prohibiting  the \nSecretary  of  the  Treasury  and  numerous  other  Executive \nBranch officers from “removing Harris from her office without \ncause or in any way treating her as having been removed \nwithout  cause.”  Harris  v.  Bessent,  No.  25-412,  2025  WL \n679303, at *16 (D.D.C. Mar. 4, 2025) (emphasis added). The \norder enjoins those same officials from “placing a replacement \nin Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other person \nas a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board in Harris’s \nposition.” Id. \nThese  injunctions  are  formally  directed  at  Executive \nBranch  officials,  not  the  President.  But  in  reality,  their \nprohibitions include actions only the President may take. By \nwhat remedial fiction can the district court enjoin the Chairman \nof the NLRB or the Treasury Secretary from removing officers \nthey have no power to remove? No one suggests anyone other \nthan the President has  authority to remove these principal \nofficers. By what remedial fiction can the district court enjoin \n\n10a\n5 \nexecutive officers from choosing a replacement for Harris? \nMembers  of  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  must  be \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.  See  5  U.S.C.  § 1201.  When  a  decision,  like \nappointment or removal, “is by Constitution or law conferred \nupon [the President], … we are precluded from saying that it \nis, in practical effect, the decision of someone else.” Franklin \nv. Massachusetts,  505  U.S.  788,  825  (1992)  (Scalia,  J.,\nconcurring  in  part  and  concurring  in  the  judgment).  The\ninjunctions  purport  to  enjoin  the  President’s  subordinates,\ndirecting them to disregard the President’s removal and to\nrefrain from taking actions within the President’s exclusive\nconstitutional  and  statutory  powers.  There  is  simply  no\nprecedent for such expansive judicial directives against officers\nof the Executive Branch wielding essential executive powers.1\nThese orders effectively reappoint officers removed by the \nPresident and direct all other Executive Branch officials to treat \nthe  removed  officers  as  if  they  were  still  in  office.  Such \ninjunctive relief is beyond the scope of our equitable authority. \nFederal courts have authority to issue only those equitable \nremedies administered by the English Court of Chancery and \ncourts sitting in equity at the time of the Founding. See Grupo \nMexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. \n308, 318–19 (1999) (“[T]he equity jurisdiction of the federal \ncourts is the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court \n1  Plaintiffs  identify  only  two  district  court  decisions  enjoining \nPresidential removal decisions. See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, \n1983 WL 538, at *6 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. \nSupp. 144, 148 (D.D.C. 1993). We vacated Mackie as moot without \nreaching the merits.

Zacharie, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) \n648, 658 (1832) (“[T]he settled doctrine of this court is, that the \nremedies in equity are to be administered … according to the \npractice of courts of equity in [England].”).  \nNothing  in  Anglo-American  history  supports  the \ninjunctive relief granted by the district court and restored by \nthe en banc majority. Although the injunctions are nominally \ndirected at subordinate executive officials, their purpose and \neffect  are  to  restrain  the  President’s  exercise  of  his \nconstitutional appointment and removal powers. But courts \nhave never possessed authority to “enjoin the President in the \nperformance of his official duties.”2 Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 \nU.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1866); see also Franklin, 505 U.S. at \n827  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (describing  this  limitation  as \n“implicit  in  the  separation  of  powers  established  by  the \nConstitution”).  \n2 The Supreme Court has left open the possibility that a court may \nenjoin the President to discharge a ministerial duty, that is, one in \nwhich the President has no discretion. See Johnson, 71 U.S. at 498 \n(reserving the question of whether “the President of the United States \nmay be required, by the process of this court, to perform a purely \nministerial act under a positive law”); Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802 \n(same). The President’s exercise of his appointment and removal \nauthority can in no way be denominated as “ministerial,” however, \nas these powers are essential to his Article II power to control and \nsupervise “those who wield executive power on his behalf.” Seila \nLaw,  140  S.  Ct.  at  2191;  see  also  Johnson,  71  U.S.  at  499 \n(distinguishing  ministerial  duties  from  “purely  executive  and \npolitical” duties).  \n\n12a\n7 \nEven indulging the fiction that the injunctions are aimed \nonly at subordinate executive officials, equitable remedies of \nthis kind still find no support in our history. At the Founding, \nit appears to have been well-established that a court sitting in \nequity had “no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal \nof public officers.”3 White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) \n(quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888)); see also \nBessent v. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 517 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting). The lesson from history is clear: Federal courts \nhave no equitable authority to enjoin the removal or to mandate \nthe reinstatement of executive officers.  \nPerhaps  recognizing  these  limits  on  our  equitable \nauthority, officers challenging their removals have generally \nrefrained  from  seeking  injunctions  mandating  their \nreinstatement.  The  removed  officers  have  instead  brought \nbackpay actions for damages. See, e.g., Wiener, 357 U.S. at \n349–50; Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 618; Myers, 272 \nU.S. at 106. The en banc majority binds itself to the mast of \n3 Equitable remedies were unavailable because courts of law had \nexclusive jurisdiction to determine title to public office. See In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888); Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. D.C. \n310, 319–21 (1914) (collecting English and American cases granting \nmandamus to restore an unlawfully removed officer). Although the \nSupreme Court has more recently stated that courts are “not totally \nwithout authority to grant interim injunctive relief” directing the \nreinstatement of wrongfully terminated federal employees, see, e.g., \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 63 (1974), such cases do not \nnecessarily  raise  the  same  constitutional  concerns  as  judicial \nreinstatement of an officer removed by the President. Even in cases \ninvolving mere employees, the Court has warned that an injunction \nwill issue only upon a heightened showing. Id. at 83–84. Insofar as \nthese decisions go beyond the scope of equity jurisdiction at the time \nof the Founding, they conflict with the Supreme Court’s more recent \nholding in Grupo. See 527 U.S. at 318–19. \n\n13a\n8 \nHumphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener  with  respect  to  the \nconstitutional merits but says nothing about these precedents \non the question of remedies.  \n* * *\nFinally, the district court and Judge Millett in her panel \ndissent  suggest  Harris  and  Wilcox  could  secure  a  writ  of \nmandamus  if  injunctive  relief  were  unavailable.  But  it  is \nextremely unlikely  that mandamus could issue to reinstate \nofficers removed by the President.  \nAs a threshold matter, against whom would mandamus lie? \nThese cases seem to present two options: The court could issue \nmandamus against the President to reinstate the officers, or it \ncould issue mandamus against everyone else in the Executive \nBranch to act as if the President has reinstated the officers. The \ndistrict  court  here  would  apparently  have  done  the  latter, \ndirecting various principal officers and their subordinates—but \nnot the President—to recognize that Harris and Wilcox remain \nin office.4 See Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *15; Wilcox, 2025 \nWL 720914, at *16 n.22. A writ of mandamus, however, may \nbe issued only when an official violates a “clear duty to act.” \nMuthana v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 893, 910 (D.C. Cir. 2021). No \nExecutive Branch officer or employee, not even the Treasury \n4 Although our decision in Swan v. Clinton contemplates that de facto \nreinstatement  via  mandamus  issued  against  Executive  Branch \nofficials  may  be  available,  that  determination  was made  in the \ncontext of finding redressability for the purposes of standing. The \ncourt  denied  relief  on  the  merits,  so  it  never  imposed  this \nextraordinary relief. See 100 F.3d 973, 976–81, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1996); \nsee also Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042–43 (D.C. Cir. 2023) \n(reaffirming Swan’s redressability analysis). Moreover, Swan says \nnothing about when it would be appropriate to impose mandamus. \nIn any event, the en banc court is not bound by Swan’s analysis. \n\n14a\n9 \nSecretary or the Chairman of the NLRB, could have violated a \nclear duty because no officer or employee removed Harris or \nWilcox—the President did. If mandamus were to issue against \nthese officers, there would be a complete mismatch between \nthe  supposedly  unlawful  removal  and  the  officers  being \ntargeted with mandamus.\nThat leaves the President. Judge Millett argued in dissent \nthat mandamus could issue against the President because he \n“violated a non-discretionary statutory duty by firing Harris \nand Wilcox without relevant justification.” See Harris, 2025 \nWL 980278, at *45 (Millett, J., dissenting). It is extremely \ndoubtful that mandamus could issue against the President. \nWhile this court has at times claimed authority to issue writs of \nmandamus against the President, I am aware of no case in \nwhich we have taken this extraordinary step. To the contrary, \nwe have repeatedly declined to issue the writ “in order to show \nthe  utmost  respect  to  the  office  of  the  Presidency  and  to \navoid … any clash between the judicial and executive branches \nof the Government.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 \nF.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974); see also Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n\nv.United States, 626 F.2d 917, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (declining\nto issue mandamus against the President).\nEven if mandamus could lie against the President, it is \nunlikely Harris and Wilcox could have established a “clear \nright to relief.” Muthana, 985 F.3d at 910. Given the substantial \nquestions regarding whether Humphrey’s Executor remains \ngood law, it is hard to see how the plaintiffs could have shown \ntheir removal from office “was so plainly and palpably wrong \nas [a] matter of law that the writ should issue.” United States \nex  rel.  Chicago  Great  W.  R.  Co.  v.  Interstate  Commerce \nComm’n, 294 U.S. 50, 61 (1935). Moreover, Harris and Wilcox \nhave failed to identify a single case in which mandamus has \nbeen granted when an officer contests his removal by the \n\n15a\n10 \nPresident. At a minimum, the fact that such a remedy has never \nbeen  imposed,  much  less  against  the  President,  is  good \nevidence that Harris and Wilcox do not have a clear entitlement \nto the writ. \nFurthermore,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  mandamus  to \nreinstate  officers  removed  by  the  President  could  ever  be \nappropriate. “Although the remedy by mandamus is at law, its \nallowance is controlled by equitable principles, and it may be \nrefused for reasons comparable to those” governing a court of \nequity. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U.S. 352, \n359  (1933)  (cleaned  up).  For  this  court  to  order  the \nperformance  of  executive  acts  vested  exclusively  in  the \nPresident would “at best create[] an unseemly appearance of \nconstitutional tension and at worst risk[] a violation of the \nconstitutional separation of powers.” Swan, 100 F.3d at 978; \nsee also Johnson, 71 U.S. at 499 (rebuffing the idea of ordering \nthe President to perform executive acts as “an absurd and \nexcessive extravagance”) (cleaned up). These constitutional \nconcerns render mandamus—an extraordinary writ—wholly \ninappropriate in these removal cases. \n* * *\nThe Constitution creates three co-equal departments of \ngovernment,  each  with  an  independent  responsibility  to \ninterpret  and  uphold  the  Constitution.  While  courts  must \nfaithfully exercise their duty to say what the law is, in choosing \nremedies, courts historically have afforded every measure of \nrespect to the President. Sound judgment demands that when \ncontemplating  coercive  process  against  the  Executive,  the \ncourts take account of the “enduring consequences upon the \nbalanced power structure of our Republic.” Youngstown Sheet \n& Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 634 (1952) (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  \n\n16a\n11 \nWithout considering the difficult questions regarding the \nscope of the court’s equitable or legal authority, the en banc \nmajority blesses the district court’s unprecedented injunctions \nand  purports  to  reinstate  principal  officers  ousted  by  the \nPresident. In so doing, the majority threatens to send this court \nheadlong into a clash with the Executive. I respectfully dissent. \n\n17a\nWALKER, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nHaving explained my views previously, I add only this: In \nPHH v. CFPB, the en banc court said that the Supreme Court \nwould need to narrow Humphrey’s Executor in order to hold \nthat  the  CFPB’s  removal  restrictions  are  unconstitutional.1  \nThen, in Seila Law, the Supreme Court held those restrictions \nunconstitutional.2  So by the PHH majority’s own reasoning, \nthe outcome in Seila Law depended on the Supreme Court \nnarrowing Humphrey’s Executor.   \nPerhaps  the  members  of  today’s  en  banc  majority \nrecognize that Humphrey’s Executor cannot be read as broadly \nas it once could but disagree with the panel in this case about \nhow  much  it  has  been  narrowed.   If  so,  it  is  hollow  and \nhyperbolic for today’s majority to proclaim, “The Supreme \n1  See  881  F.3d  75,  93  (D.C.  Cir.  2018)  (“There  is  nothing \nconstitutionally  suspect  about  the  CFPB’s  leadership  structure. \nMorrison and Humphrey’s Executor stand in the way of any holding \nto the contrary.”); id. at 113 (Tatel, J., concurring, joined by Millett, \nJ., and Pillard, J.) (“PHH is free to ask the Supreme Court to revisit \nHumphrey’s Executor and Morrison, but that argument has no truck \nin a circuit court of appeals.”); id. at 118 (Wilkins, J., concurring, \njoined by Rogers, J.) (“the dissenters seek to overcome the precedent \nupholding  tenure  protection  for  officers  with  significant  quasi-\njudicial and quasi-legislative responsibilities”). \nSimilarly, in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, the majority said \nthe “bulk of the Fund’s challenge to the Act was fought — and \nlost — over seventy years ago when the Supreme Court decided \nHumphrey’s Executor.”  537 F.3d 667, 685 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The \nSupreme Court disagreed.  Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 \nU.S. 477, 514 (2010) (“While we have sustained in certain cases \nlimits on the President’s removal power, the Act before us imposes \na new type of restriction — two levels of protection from removal \nfor those who nonetheless exercise significant executive power. \nCongress cannot limit the President’s authority in this way.”). \n2 Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2197 (2020). \n\n18a\n2 \nCourt has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant \nSupreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself \nchanges it or overturns it.”  Each of us recognizes that a lower \ncourt  cannot  overrule  Humphrey’s  Executor.    We  simply \ndisagree about how broadly to read it. \n\n19a\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5037 September Term, 2024\n1:25-cv-00412-RC\nFiled On: April 7, 2025 \nCathy A.

Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nDaniel J. Reidy \nDeputy Clerk\nPage 2\n\n25a\n \nWALKER, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nArticle II of the Constitution vests the “executive Power” \nin “a President of the United States” and requires him to “take \nCare  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully  executed.”1    “To  protect \nindividual  liberty,  the  Framers . . . created  a  President \nindependent  from  the  Legislative  Branch.”2    “To  further \nsafeguard liberty, the Framers insisted upon accountability for \nthe  exercise  of  executive  power,”  so  they  “lodged  full \nresponsibility for the executive power in a President of the \nUnited  States,  who  is  elected  by  and  accountable  to  the \npeople.”3   \nExecutive branch agencies do not disrupt that design when \nthey are accountable to the President.  “But consent of the \ngoverned is a sham if an administrative agency, by design, does \nnot meaningfully answer for its policies to either of the elected \nbranches.”4    That’s  why  the  Supreme  Court  has  said  that \nCongress cannot restrict the President’s removal authority over \nagencies that “wield substantial executive power.”5 \nThat Court’s precedents control this court’s case.  Under \nthose  precedents,  the  Government  is  likely  to  succeed  in \nshowing that the statutory removal protections for National \nLabor  Relations  Board  commissioners  and  Merit  Systems \nProtection  Board  members  are  unconstitutional.    The \nGovernment has also shown that it will suffer irreparable harm \neach day the President is deprived of the ability to control the \nexecutive branch.  Conversely, the removed officials suffer no \n \n1 U.S. Const., art. II, §§ 1, 3. \n2 Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 537 F.3d 667, 689 (D.C. Cir. \n2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). \n3 PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 164 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (en banc) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). \n4 Id. at 137 (Henderson, J., dissenting). \n5 Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2199-2200 (2020). \n \n\n26a\n2 \ncognizable  irreparable  harm  during  the  pendency  of  these \nappeals, nor do the agencies where they previously worked \nuntil the President fired them.  Finally, the public interest also \nsupports a stay.  The people elected the President to enforce the \nnation’s laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the \npeople’s chosen officer to control the executive branch. \nI therefore support granting the motions for a stay pending \nappeal in Harris v. Bessent (25-5055) and Wilcox v. Trump (25-\n5057). \nI. Background \nThe  National  Labor  Relations  Board  and  the  Merit \nSystems Protection Board are executive branch agencies.  By \nthe  terms  of  statutes  that  the  Government  argues  are \nunconstitutional,  their  members  may  be  removed  only  for \ncause.6   \nOn January 27, 2025, President Donald Trump removed \nGwynne Wilcox from the NLRB prior to her term’s expiration \nin  2028.    In  an  explanatory  letter,  the  President  informed \nWilcox that the NLRB had not “been operating in a manner \nconsistent with the objectives of [his] administration.”7  Citing \nseveral  recent  Board  decisions,  he  expressed  concern  that \nWilcox was “unduly disfavoring the interests of employers.”8 \nWilcox sued for reinstatement on February 5, 2025.  Five \ndays later, she moved for summary judgment on an expedited \nbasis.  After a hearing on March 5, the district court granted \n \n6 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) (MSPB); 29 U.S.C § 153(a) (NLRB). \n7 Pl.’s Ex. A at 2, Wilcox v. Trump, No. 25-cv-334 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, \n2025), ECF No. 10-4. \n8 Id. \n \n\n27a\n3 \nsummary judgment to Wilcox, declaring that she remained a \nmember of the NLRB and permanently enjoining the NLRB’s \nChair and his subordinates from effectuating the President’s \nremoval order. \nA similar chain of events occurred in Harris v. Bessent.  \nOn February 10, 2025, the President removed Cathy Harris \nfrom the MSPB prior to her term’s expiration in 2028.  Unlike \nWilcox, Harris did not receive an explanatory letter.  \nHarris sued for reinstatement on February 11, 2025.  Seven \ndays later, the district court granted her request for a temporary \nrestraining order, effectively reinstating her to the MSPB.  A \nfew  weeks later, the  court granted summary judgment  for \nHarris, declaring that she remained a member of the MSPB and \npermanently  enjoining  various  government  officials  from \nexecuting the President’s removal order. \nIn  defending  these  removals,  the  Government  has  not \nargued that the President met the statutory criteria for removal.9  \nInstead,  it  has  insisted  that  those  provisions  are \nunconstitutional infringements on the President’s Article II \nremoval power — a position consistent with the President’s \nrecent executive order regarding independent agencies.10 \n \n9 See 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) (removal “only for inefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office”); 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (removal only \n“upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in \noffice, but for no other cause”). \n10 Exec. Order No. 14,215, Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies \n(Feb. 18, 2025), https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-03063. \nThe Government also maintains that federal district courts lack \nthe equitable power to reinstate an officer who has been removed by \nthe President.  Because this court grants the Government’s stay \napplication on alternative grounds, I have no occasion to address this \n \n\n28a\n4 \nOn that basis, the Government appealed both orders and \nmoved for emergency stays pending appeal.  We considered \nthe two motions together and heard oral argument on March \n18, 2025. \nII. The Presidential Removal Power \n  Before addressing the stay factors, it is prudent to address \nthe text, history, and precedents that control this preliminary \nmerits determination. \nA.  History \nI begin with a review of our nation’s founding period, the \ncreation of our Constitution, and the historical practice in the \ndecades that followed. \n1.  The Energetic Executive \nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the early Republic \nexperienced the perils of having a weak executive.  With “no \nexecutive separate from Congress,”11 the federal government \nhad to rely on the states’ good graces to carry out national \npolicies.12    And  it  was  powerless  to  respond  to  national \n \nargument.

Ct. 515, 517 (2025) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (observing that “by the 1880s [the Supreme] \nCourt considered  it ‘well settled that a  court of equity has no \njurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers’” \n(quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888))); Dellinger v. \nBessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *14 (D.C.

Original Understanding of the Removal Power \nAgainst that backdrop, the Constitution assigns a lofty role \nto the President.  Article II vests the “executive Power” in the \n“President of the United States of America.”31  And it charges \nthe  President  to  “take  Care  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully \nexecuted.”32   \nOf course, the President cannot carry out his duties “alone \nand  unaided” — he  must  enlist  the  “assistance  of \nsubordinates.”33    The  Framers  envisioned  a  “chain  of \ndependence”  in  the  executive  branch,  where  “the  lowest \nofficers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as they \nought, on the President.”34  The Vesting Clause empowers the \nPresident  to  direct  and  control  those  officials.    As  James \nMadison explained, “if any power whatsoever is in its nature \nexecutive,  it  is  the  power  of  appointing,  overseeing,  and \ncontrolling those who execute the laws.”35   \n \n29 Id. \n30 Id. \n31 U.S. Const. art.

The \nFirst Congress encountered the question directly, and its debate \nand decision — now called “the Decision of 1789” — provides \n“contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s \nmeaning since many of the Members of the First Congress had \ntaken part in framing that instrument.”38 \nDuring the summer of 1789 “ensued what has been many \ntimes described as one of the ablest constitutional debates \nwhich has taken place.”39  The topic of the President’s removal \npower came up “during consideration of a bill establishing \ncertain Executive Branch offices and providing that the officers \n \n36 Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 492 (quoting Letter from James \nMadison to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), in 16 Documentary \nHistory of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004)). \n37 Id.

After \nrecounting  the  Decision  of  1789  and  the  “continued  and \nuninterrupted practice” of plenary presidential removal, the \nCourt construed Parsons’ four-year term as a ceiling for how \nlong he could remain in office — not as a restriction on the \nPresident’s power to remove him sooner.67 \nAs this history demonstrates, the Founders understood that \nthe President had inherent, inviolable, and unlimited authority \nto remove principal officers exercising substantial executive \nauthority, and Presidents have exercised that authority since the \nvery  beginning  of  the  Republic,  beginning  with  George \nWashington. \nB.  Precedent \nWith those historical underpinnings, I turn to the Supreme \nCourt’s more recent precedents.  The Court has reaffirmed the \nPresident’s  inherent  removal  power  on  several  occasions, \n \n63 Free Enterprise Fund, 537 F.3d at 692 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). \n64 Id. at 692-93. \n65 Parsons, 167 U.S. at 327-28. \n66 Id. at 328. \n67 Id. at 338-39, 340. \n \n\n39a\n15 \nrelying  often  on  the  historical  evidence  recounted  in  the \npreceding section.   \nThat is not to say the Court’s removal-power jurisprudence \nhas  always  been  consistent.    Though  the  Court  in  Myers \nreaffirmed  the  President’s  unilateral  removal  power, \nHumphrey’s Executor created an exception to the rule.  It left \nfuture courts to decide when that exception might apply.  To \nthe extent that Humphrey’s created a showdown between the \nMyers rule and the Humphrey’s exception, the Court’s recent \ndecisions have been unequivocal: Humphrey’s has few, if any, \napplications today.  To discern the Supreme Court’s rule, I \nreview the Court’s holdings, beginning with Myers. \n1.  Myers \nIn 1920, President Woodrow Wilson removed postmaster \nFrank Myers from office.68  Myers sought backpay, relying on \na statute that required the President to obtain Senate approval \nbefore  removing  him — something  the  President  had \nindisputably not done.69  The question before the Court was \nwhether the Constitution permitted such a restriction. \nWriting for the Court, Chief Justice Taft undertook a deep \nhistorical  survey,  concluding  that  the  statutory  provision \ndenying the President the “unrestricted power of removal” was \n“in violation of the Constitution and invalid.”70  That survey \nhighlighted much of the history recounted above, including the \nDecision of 1789.  The Court focused on four points advanced \n \n68 Myers, 272 U.S. at 106. \n69 Id. at 107-08. \n70 Id. at 176. \n \n\n40a\n16 \nby James Madison and his allies during that congressional \ndebate. \nFirst,  Myers  stressed  that  the  President’s  supervisory \npower over officers is crucial for protecting the separation of \npowers: “If there is any point in which the separation of the \nlegislative and executive powers ought to be maintained with \ngreat caution, it is that which relates to officers and offices.”71  \nIt further explained that to “take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted,” the President must be able to “select those who were \nto act for him under his direction” and remove “those for whom \nhe  cannot  continue  to  be  responsible.”72    The  Court’s \nconclusion: “[N]o express limit was placed on the power of \nremoval by the executive” and “none was intended.”73 \nSecond, the Court considered whether the Senate’s role in \npresidential appointments carried with it a corresponding role \nin removals.  It concluded that history would not support that \ninference.  The power of removal “is different in its nature from \nthat  of  appointment,”  as  was  “pointed  out”  in  the  First \nCongress’s debate.74  That’s because a Senate veto of a removal \n“is a much greater limitation upon the executive branch, and a \nmuch  more  serious  blending  of  the  legislative  with  the \nexecutive, than a rejection of a proposed appointment.”75  So \nwhere the Constitution does not directly provide Congress any \npower over removals, that power “is not to be implied.”76 \n \n71 Id. (quoting 1 Annals of Congress 581 (1789) (James Madison)). \n72 Id. at 117, 122. \n73 Myers, 272 U.S. at 118. \n74 Id. at 121. \n75 Id. \n76 Id. \n \n\n41a\n17 \nThird, the Court observed that Congress’s power to create \noffices  did  not  carry  a  corresponding  power  to  limit  the \nPresident’s removal power over them.  The “legislative power” \nis “limited to” the powers “enumerated” under Article I of the \nConstitution;  the  “executive  power”  is  a  “more  general \ngrant.”77  Thus, the Court found it “reasonable to suppose” that \nif the Founders “intended to give to Congress power to regulate \nor control removals,” they would have included those powers \n“among  the  specifically  enumerated  legislative  powers  in \narticle 1, or in the specified limitations on the executive power \nin article 2.”78 \nFourth and finally, the Court noted the threat that Congress \ncould  “thwart[] the  executive in  the exercise  of his  great \npowers  and  in  the  bearing  of  his  great  responsibility  by \nfastening upon him . . . men who” might render his faithful \nexecution of the laws “difficult or impossible” — be it “by \ntheir inefficient service under him, by their lack of loyalty to \nthe service, or by their different views of policy.”79  To avoid \nthis  possibility,  the  moment  that  the  President  “loses \nconfidence in the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of \nany one of [his subordinates], he must have the power to \nremove him without delay.”80 \nThe Court specifically included within that authority the \npower to remove executive officers whose duties include those \n“of a quasi judicial character.”81  Though the Court noted that \n“the President cannot . . . properly influence or control” the \ndischarge of such duties, he may still “consider the decision \n \n77 Id. at 128. \n78 Myers, 272 U.S. at 128. \n79 Id. at 131. \n80 Id. at 134. \n81 Id. at 135. \n \n\n42a\n18 \nafter its rendition as a reason for removing the officer. . . . \nOtherwise he does not discharge his own constitutional duty of \nseeing that the laws be faithfully executed.”82 \nMyers was a landmark decision.  It established that the \nPresident’s removal power is grounded in the Constitution’s \ntext and history and bolstered by tradition.  It is essential to the \nconstitutional  separation  of  powers  and  to  the  President’s \nability to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”83   \n2.  Humphrey’s Executor  \nThen came Humphrey’s Executor.84  It reaffirmed the core \nholding of Myers — that the President holds an “illimitable \npower of removal” over “purely executive officers.”85  But “in \nsix quick pages devoid of textual or historical precedent for the \nnovel  principle  it  set  forth,”86  Humphrey’s  carved  out  an \nexception for agencies that wield “no part of the executive \npower.”87 \nAccording to the Court, that exception permitted Congress \nto insulate officers of the relevant agency, the Federal Trade \nCommission, from at-will removal.  That exception rested on \nthe  Court’s  characterization  of  the  FTC  as  an  entity  that \nexercised “no part of the executive power” and that in no way \nacted as “an arm or an eye of the executive.”88  Instead, the \n \n82 Id. \n83 U.S. Const. art.

Olson,  487  U.S.  654,  726  (1988)  (Scalia,  J., \ndissenting). \n87 Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628. \n88 Id. \n \n\n43a\n19 \nCourt viewed the agency as “wholly disconnected from the \nexecutive department” — “an agency of the legislative and \njudicial departments.”89 \nConfronted with the 1935 FTC’s role in investigating and \nreporting  violations  of  the  law — responsibilities  typically \nassociated with the executive branch — the Court insisted that \nthe  1935  FTC  did  not  wield  “executive  power  in  the \nconstitutional  sense,”  even  if  it  performed  an  “executive \nfunction.”90  To justify the distinction, it classified the agency’s \nwork as “neither political nor executive, but predominantly \nquasi judicial and quasi legislative.”91 \nThe Humphrey’s Court conceded the ambiguity inherent \nin  its  ruling,  acknowledging  a  potential  “field  of  doubt” \nbetween  Myers — where  presidential  removal  power  over \npurely  executive  officers  was  absolute — and  Humphrey’s, \nwhich  permitted  removal  restrictions  only  if  an  agency \n“exercise[d] no part of the executive power.”92  Rather than \nclarifying the boundaries between these categories, the Court \nexplicitly deferred such questions for “future consideration and \ndetermination.”93 \n \n89 Id. at 630. \n90 Id. at 28. \nI say the “1935 FTC” to distinguish it from the 2025 FTC, which \nexercises greater power than the 1935 FTC.  See, e.g., Collins v. \nYellen, 141 S. Ct. 1761, 1806 (2021) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in \npart and dissenting in part) (“1935 FTC did not [have] the power to \nimpose fines”). \n91 Id. at 624. \n92 Id. at 628, 632. \n93 Id. at 632. \n \n\n44a\n20 \nAs the rest of this survey will show, subsequent decisions \nby the Supreme Court have come close to closing the gap that \nHumphrey’s left.

United States.94  There, \nthe Court “read a removal restriction into the War Claims Act \nof  1948”  because  the  War  Claims  Commission  “was  an \nadjudicatory body.”95 \nThe Wiener opinion took for granted that the Commission \nwas purely an adjudicatory body.  Indeed, the Commission’s \nentire  responsibility,  in  the  Court’s  view,  consisted  of \n“receiv[ing]  and  adjudicat[ing] . . . three  classes  of  claims” \ndefined  by  statute.96    Nothing  more.    So  in  Wiener,  the \nHumphrey’s  exception  continued  unchanged:  Officers  of \nagencies that do not exercise executive power may be insulated \nfrom presidential removal. \n \n94 357 U.S. 349 (1958); cf.

Free Enterprise Fund \nThe  Court  declined  to  extend  Humphrey’s  in  Free \nEnterprise Fund v. PCAOB.97  That case involved a challenge \nto the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s double-\nlayer removal protections — its members were removable only \nfor cause by SEC commissioners who in turn were removable \nonly for cause.98  \nReversing a panel decision of this court, the Supreme \nCourt  rejected  the  Board’s  structure  as  a  violation  of  the \nVesting Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Constitution’s \nseparation  of  powers.99   Multi-layered  removal  protections \nrendered the President helpless to “oversee the faithfulness of \nthe officers who execute” the law.100  If an inferior officer \nperformed poorly, the President could not remove him; nor \ncould the President remove the poor performer’s supervisor for \nfailing to carry out the desired removal.101  As a result, the \nPresident  had  no  way  to  hold  officers  accountable  in  the \nexecutive branch. \nAccording to Free Enterprise Fund, the Founders created \na unitary executive in part to ensure political accountability to \nthe people.  Because citizens “do not vote for the ‘Officers of \nthe United States,’” they must instead “look to the President to \nguide  the  ‘assistants  or  deputies  . . .  subject  to  his \n \n97 561 U.S. 477 (2010). \n98 Id. at 487. \n99 Id. at 484, 492. \n100 Id. at 484. \n101 Id. \n \n\n46a\n22 \nsuperintendence.”102  Without this “clear and effective chain of \ncommand,” voters cannot identify “on whom the blame or the \npunishment” should fall when the government errs.103   \nThe Court stressed that its decision did not constrain the \nsize  of  the  executive  branch  but  instead  safeguarded  its \naccountability.  The larger and more complex the executive \nbranch becomes, the greater the risk that it will “slip from the \nExecutive’s control, and thus from that of the people.”104  As \nthe executive branch expands — wielding “vast power and \ntouch[ing]  almost  every  aspect  of  daily  life” — its \naccountability to a democratically elected President is even \nmore essential.105   \nWhere did Free Enterprise Fund leave Myers?  It called \nMyers a “landmark.”106  And it reaffirmed Myers’ “principle \nthat  Article  II  confers  on  the  President  ‘the  general \nadministrative control of those executing the laws,’” including \nthe removal power.107   \nAnd Humphrey’s?  The Court declined to extend that \ndecision to “a new type of restriction.”108  So Free Enterprise \n \n102 Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 497-98 (first quoting U.S. \nConst. art I, § 2, cl. 2, then quoting The Federalist No. 72 (Alexander \nHamilton)). \n103 Id. at 498 (quoting The Federalist No. 70 (Alexander Hamilton)). \n104 Id. at 499. \n105 Id. \n106 Id. at 492. \n107 Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 492 (quoting Myers, 272 U.S. \nat 164). \n108 Id. at 514. \n \n\n47a\n23 \nFund’s  reasoning  “is  in  tension  with”  Humphrey’s,109 \nincluding  Humphrey’s  departure  from  Myers’  “traditional \ndefault  rule”  that  “removal  is  incident  to  the  power  of \nappointment.”110  For any future case about an agency in the \n“field of doubt” between Myers and Humphrey’s, the Court \ndirected us to apply Myers, not Humphrey’s. \n5.  Seila Law \nThe Court again declined to extend Humphrey’s in Seila \nLaw  LLC  v. CFPB.111    That  case  presented  another  “new \nsituation”: “an independent agency,” the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, “led by a single Director and vested with \nsignificant executive power.”112   \nAs in Free Enterprise Fund, the Supreme Court repudiated \na decision of this court.113  And as in Free Enterprise Fund, the \nSupreme Court took the President’s absolute removal power as \nexpressed in Myers as “the rule,” with Humphrey’s as a limited \nexception.114  The Court explained that Humphrey’s represents \n“the  outermost  constitutional  limits  of  permissible \ncongressional restrictions on the President’s removal power,” \n \n109 PHH Corp. v.

Collins \nCollins v. Yellen applied Seila Law’s holding to another \nindependent agency led by a single top officer — the Federal \nHousing Finance Authority.117  In doing so, the Court doubled \ndown  on  its  prior  reasoning  and  has  been  understood  by \nsome — including Justice Kagan — to have gone even further \nthan Seila Law in affirming the Myers default rule.118   \nFirst, the Court rejected the argument that FHFA’s more \nlimited authority justified its removal protection.119  Instead, \nthe Court reaffirmed the President’s removal power as serving \n“vital purposes” regardless of an agency’s scope or power.120   \n \n115 Id. at 2200 (quoting PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 196 (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting)) (emphasis added). \n116 Id. at 2200-01. \n117 See 141 S.

Ct. at 1785 (cleaned up). \n123 Id. at 1786. \n124 Id.  \n125 Id. \n126 Id. \n127 Collins, 141 S. Ct. at 1786. \n \n\n50a\n26 \nthat the Constitution “prohibits even ‘modest restrictions’” on \nthe President’s removal power.128 \nOnce again, Myers occupied the “field of doubt” between \nthe (by now exceptionally broad) Myers rule and the (by now \nexceptionally narrow) Humphrey’s exception. \nC.  The State of the Doctrine Today \nText, history, and precedent are clear: The Constitution \nvests the “entire ‘executive Power’” in the President.129  That \npower “includes the ability to remove executive officials.”130  \nWithout  such  power,  it  would  be  “impossible  for  the \nPresident . . . to  take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully \nexecuted.”131 \nThe Supreme Court has “left in place two exceptions to the \nPresident’s unrestricted removal power.”132  Each of them is \nbinding on lower  courts, even if each of them  is  also  on \njurisprudential  life  support.    One  of  them — Morrison  v. \nOlson — is not relevant here.133   \nThe second exception is Humphrey’s.  It allows Congress \nto restrict the President’s removal power for “a multimember \nbody of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that perform[s] \nlegislative and judicial functions” and exercises “no part of the \n \n128 Id. at 1787 (quoting Seila Law, 140 S.

Ct. at 2200 (Morrison \ncovers “inferior officers with limited duties and no policymaking or \nadministrative authority”). \n \n\n51a\n27 \nexecutive power.”134  Under modern Supreme Court precedent, \nthat  exception  stretches  no  further  than  partisan-balanced \n“multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial \nexecutive power.”135 \nFor a court to conclude that an executive agency wields \nsubstantial  executive  power,  it  need  not  assemble  a  fact-\nintensive catalog of the agency’s executive functions.  The \ndefault: Executive agencies exercise executive power.  The \nexception covers only an agency materially indistinguishable \nfrom the 1935 FTC, as Humphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC.   \nWhy  did  the  Supreme  Court  narrow  Humphrey’s  so \nseverely in Seila Law and Collins?   \nPerhaps  it  was  because  Humphrey’s  “authorize[s]  a \nsignificant intrusion on the President’s Article II authority to \nexercise the executive power and take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.”136 \nOr perhaps it was because Humphrey’s “did not pause to \nexamine how a purpose to create a body ‘subject only to the \npeople of the  United States’ — that is,  apparently, beyond \ncontrol  of  the  constitutionally  defined  branches  of \n \n134 Id. at 2198-99 (second part quoting Humphrey’s Executor, 295 \nU.S. at 628). \n135 Id. at 2199-2200. \nAlthough the CFPB does not conduct adjudications, it’s clear that \nSeila’s “substantial executive power” test applies to adjudicatory \nagencies like the MSPB and NLRB.  After all, Seila was describing \nthe  exception  in Humphrey’s,  which  dealt  with  an  adjudicatory \nagency — the 1935 FTC. \n136  Free  Enterprise  Fund,  537  F.3d  at  696  (Kavanaugh,  J., \ndissenting). \n \n\n52a\n28 \ngovernment — could  itself  be  sustained  under  the \nConstitution.”137 \nOr  perhaps  it  was  because  Humphrey’s  relied  on \ninconsistent separation-of-powers logic, which fails to account \nfor how “an agency can at the same moment reside in both the \nlegislative and the judicial branches” without infringing on “the \n‘fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general \ndepartments of government entirely free from the control or \ncoercive influence . . . of either of the others.’”138   \nOr  perhaps  still  it  was  because  Humphrey’s  made \nincomprehensible distinctions “between ‘executive function’ \nand ‘executive power.’”139  “Of course the commission was \ncarrying  out  laws  Congress  had  enacted;  in  that  sense  its \nfunctions could hardly have been characterized as other than \nexecutive, whatever procedures it employed to accomplish its \nends.”140 \nWhatever the reason, without overturning Humphrey’s, \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  seemed  “keen  to  prune . . . \nHumphrey’s.”141    The  Court’s  recent  opinions  have \n“characterized the ‘independent agencies’ as executive and \n \n137  Peter  L.

Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1050 (D.C. \nCir.  2023)  (Walker,  J.,  concurring)  (citing  Oil  States  Energy \nServices, LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC, 138 S. Ct. 1365, \n1372-73 (2018)).  And “congress cannot delegate legislative power \nto the president.”  Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692 \n(1892); cf. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 419 (1989) \n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (“Strictly speaking, there is no acceptable \ndelegation of legislative power.”).  As a result, while specifically \nlisting an executive agency’s executive functions is a sufficient basis \nfor concluding the President may remove that agency’s principal \nofficers, it is not a necessary basis.  See Collins, 141 S. Ct. at 1801 \n(Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) \n(arguing that Collins “broaden[ed]” Seila Law by clarifying that “the \nconstitutionality of removal restrictions does not hinge on the nature \nand breadth of an agency’s authority” (cleaned up)).  If it’s not \nexercising executive power, what is it doing in the executive branch?  \nCf. Severino, 71 F.4th at 1050 (Walker, J., concurring) (“[I]t might \nbe that little to nothing is left of the Humphrey’s exception to the \ngeneral rule that the President may freely remove his subordinates.”). \n143 Mallory v.

And if the agency in question is the identical twin \nof the 1935 FTC (as Humphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC) \nthen Humphrey’s controls.   \nBut as Judge Henderson wrote in 2018, we should “be \nloath to cede any more of Article II than Humphrey’s Executor \nsquarely demands.”144  Since then, Seila Law and Collins have \nturned that wisdom into a binding command on the lower \ncourts.  As in the context of Bivens — like Humphrey’s, a \nprecedent not overruled but severely narrowed by subsequent \ndecisions — “[e]ven  a  modest  extension  is  still  an \nextension.”145  And because the Supreme Court has forbidden \nextensions of Humphrey’s to any new contexts, we cannot \nextend Humphrey’s — not even an inch.   \nIII. Stay Factors \nTo determine whether a stay pending appeal is appropriate, \n“we ask (1) whether the applicant is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, (2) whether it will suffer irreparable injury without a \nstay, (3) whether the stay will substantially injure the other \nparties interested in the proceedings, and (4) where the public \ninterest  lies.”146    “The  first  two  factors . . . are  the  most \ncritical.”147 \n \n144 PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 156 (Henderson, J., dissenting). \n145 Id.

Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nUnder binding Supreme Court precedent, Congress cannot \nrestrict the President’s power to remove the principal officers \nof agencies that “wield substantial executive power.”148  And \nfor the reasons explained below, the NLRB and the MSPB \n“exercis[e] substantial executive authority” — as then-Judge \nKavanaugh said in a dissent later vindicated by Seila Law.149   \nBecause those agencies exercise  “substantial  executive \npower,”150 the Government is likely to prevail in its contention \nthat the President may fire NLRB commissioners and MSPB \nmembers.   \n1.  Wilcox v. Trump \nThe NLRB is an executive branch agency that administers \nfederal labor law.151  It has five members who are “appointed \nby the President by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.”152  They serve five-year terms,  and the  President \nchooses “one member to serve as Chairman.”153  The statute \npurports to restrict the President’s removal power.154 \n \n148 Seila Law v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct.2183, 2199-2200 (2020). \n149 PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 173 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (en banc) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).   \n150 Seila Law, 140 S.

It is not a “mere \nlegislative or judicial aid.”161  Instead, it is a (strong) arm of the \nexecutive branch and wields substantial executive power.162 \nTo  reinstate  Wilcox,  the  district  court  relied  on  an \noverbroad reading of Humphrey’s and a misplaced emphasis \non twentieth-century history. \nFirst,  beginning  with  Humphrey’s,  the  district  court \ncompared the NLRB to the 1935 FTC, arguing that they share \nsimilar functions and authorities.163  But the two agencies are \nfar from identical.  For one thing, the NLRB is not subject to a \nstatutorily imposed partisan-balance requirement.164  And the \nNLRB exercises authorities that the 1935 FTC did not.  For \nexample, it has the power to go directly to federal court to seek \ninjunctions  against  employers  or  unions  while  a  case  is \npending.165  And the NLRB’s ability to seek monetary relief \nlike backpay “against private parties on behalf of the United \n \n161 Id. \n162 True, as the district court pointed out, the General Counsel \n(removable at will) leads investigations and prosecutions “on behalf \nof the Board.”  Wilcox v.

But the \nGeneral Counsel is subservient to the NLRB, which possesses the \nsole power to seek enforcement of its orders in federal court, pursue \ninjunctive  relief,  and  approve  certain  settlements.    29  U.S.C. \n§ 160(e), (j); NLRB v.

But it is not our job to ask, “What \nwould the 1935 Court do?”  Rather, we must ask what the \nSupreme Court has done — in Humphrey’s yes, but also in \nSeila Law, Collins, and the Court’s other precedents (guided by \nthe  original  meaning  of  the  Constitution  when  binding \nprecedent does not answer the question).167 \nUnder Seila Law, “the Humphrey’s Executor exception \ndepend[s]” on “the set  of powers the  [Humphrey’s] Court \nconsidered as the basis for its decision, not any latent powers \nthat the agency may have had not alluded to by the Court.”168  \nUnder  Collins,  “the  President’s  removal  power  serves \nimportant  purposes  regardless  of  whether  the  agency  in \nquestion  affects  ordinary  Americans  by  directly  regulating \nthem or by taking actions that have a profound but indirect \neffect on their lives.”169   \nThe district court did not grapple with these developments, \ninstead fixating on Humphrey’s.  Opposing the Government’s \nstay  motion,  Wilcox  supports  that  approach,  repeating  the \nuncontroversial statement that Humphrey’s is “good law,” as if \nthat requires us to read it broadly when the Supreme Court’s \n \n166 See Seila Law, 140 S. Ct. at 2200. \n167 See id. at 2198-99; Collins, 141 S. Ct. at 1784-86. \n168 Seila Law, 140 S. Ct. at 2198, 2200 n.4. \n169 Collins, 141 S. Ct. at 1786. \n \n\n59a\n35 \nmore recent precedents command us to read it narrowly.170  \nThat approach does not faithfully apply precedent. \nUnder a faithful application of Seila Law and Collins, \nHumphrey’s  controls  only  if  an  agency  is  materially \nindistinguishable from the 1935 FTC.  Humphrey’s covers \nnothing more than that because the reasoning in Seila Law and \nCollins requires a reading of Humphrey’s that covers nothing \nmore than that.  In other words, Humphrey’s can cover only an \nagency that exercises no “substantial executive power.”  The \ndistrict court “chants [Humphrey’s Executor] like a mantra, but \nno matter how many times it repeats those words, it cannot give \n[Humphrey’s Executor] substance” that Seila Law and Collins \nsay “that it lacks.”171 \nStrikingly, the district court gave short shrift to Collins, \ndismissing it in a footnote because it involved a single-headed \nagency and the Court “reaffirmed it ‘did not revisit its prior \ndecisions.’”172    Of  course  neither  Seila  Law  nor  Collins \noverruled Humphrey’s.  But we are not free to ignore the \nSupreme Court’s binding interpretation of its precedent simply \nbecause the Court didn’t overrule that precedent.   \nAfter Seila Law, a removal restriction is valid only if it \n(1) applies to a “multimember expert agenc[y], balanced along \npartisan lines” that (2) does not “wield substantial executive \npower.”173  Though the FHFA in Collins clearly failed the first \nprong, the Court also addressed the second prong.  When \nCollins  did  so,  it  arguably  “broaden[ed]”  Seila  Law  and \n \n170 Wilcox Opp. 1, 15, 16. \n171 SEC v. Jarkesy, 144 S.

The \ndistrict  court  found  it  persuasive  that  no  President  before \nPresident Trump removed an NLRB commissioner.175  But \nSupreme  Court  precedent,  not  twentieth-century  history, \nresolves this case.  And as the district court said, Congress’s \nwidespread  use  of  independent,  multimember  boards  and \ncommissions did not begin until the early 1900s.176  So even if \nwe were evaluating the original meaning of Article II on a \nblank slate, which we aren’t, that twentieth-century history \nwould be of limited value for discerning the Constitution’s \noriginal meaning.177   \nFinally,  the  district  court  described  the  President’s \nremoval of Wilcox as a “power grab” and “blatantly illegal.”178  \nBut  unconstitutional  statutes  are  void  ab  initio  because \n \n174 Id. at 1801 (Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment). \n175 Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at *5. \n176 See id. at *6. \n177  Similarly  unpersuasive  is  Wilcox’s  assertion  that  Congress \nspecifically designed the NLRB to be independent.  Wilcox Opp. 5-\n6.  That may well be true, but it does not bear on whether Article II, \nas  interpreted  by  the  Supreme  Court,  renders  NLRB  removal \nrestrictions invalid.  After all, “Members of Congress designed the \nPCAOB  to  have  ‘massive  power,  unchecked  power.’”    Free \nEnterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 537 F.3d 667, 687 (D.C.

That did not win the day at the Supreme \nCourt. \n178 Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at *3, *5. \n \n\n61a\n37 \nCongress lacks the authority to enact them.179  Such statutes are \nnot law, so it is not “illegal” for the President to violate them.180  \nAnd under the Supreme Court’s precedents, the President’s \nactions within the executive branch cannot amount to a “power \ngrab” because “[t]he entire ‘executive Power’ belongs to the \nPresident alone.”181    \n*  *  * \n  The  NLRB  exercises  “substantial  executive  power.”182  \nTherefore, the Government is likely to prevail in its argument \nthat the NLRB’s removal protections are unconstitutional.  \n2.

MSPB adjudication is nothing \nmore than intra-branch dispute resolution.  That’s an exercise \nof executive (not quasi-judicial) power. \nIn additional ways, the MSPB is not like the 1935 FTC as \nunderstood  by  Humphrey’s.    It  reviews  the  removal  and \ndiscipline of federal employees and has the power to directly \noverride other executive agencies’ disciplinary actions.198  That \ngives  it  a  significant  authority  that  the  FTC  never  had.  \nAdditionally, the MSPB has the power to issue binding orders \nand “enforce compliance with any such order.”199  The 1935 \nFTC lacked that power.  It could issue cease-and-desist orders, \nbut if those were disobeyed, the agency had to petition to a \nfederal court to enforce its orders.200   \nNor is the MSPB like the War Claims Commission in \nWiener.  The MSPB is a permanent body, unlike the temporary \nWar Claims Commission, which served the limited purpose of \nassigning distributions from a compensation fund.201  More \nimportantly, the MSPB’s powers far outstrip the War Claims \nCommission’s in a critical way — it can force the President to \n \n197 See Frazier v. MSPB, 672 F.2d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (the \nMSPB adjudicates “conflicts between federal workers and their \nemploying agencies”). \n198 5 U.S.C. § 7701.   \n199 Id. § 1204(a)(1)-(2).   \n200 See Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 620-21 (citing 15 U.S.C. \n§ 45). \n201 Wiener v.

To the extent its ability to invalidate \ncertain regulations resembles legislative activity, that authority \ndoes not involve public-facing regulation.203  So again, even \nunder a broad reading of Humphrey’s, the MSPB’s functions \ndo not align with those of the 1935 FTC or the War Claims \nCommission.  The MSPB “is hardly a mere legislative or \njudicial aid.”204  It does far more than merely make “reports and \nrecommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did.”205 \nThe district court recognized that the MSPB “preserves \npower within the executive branch by charging presidentially \nappointed  [MSPB]  members  with  mediation  and  initial \nadjudication  of  federal  employment  disputes.”206    But  the \ndistrict court erred in concluding that the MSPB’s “features” \nmade any effect on the President’s exercise of the executive \npower “limited.”207  To the contrary, as one member of the \nSupreme  Court  has  already  acknowledged,  the  preserved \npower within the MSPB is “substantial executive authority.”208  \nIn Harris’s tenure alone, the MSPB resolved thousands of \ncases involving “allegations that federal agencies engaged in \n \n202 Seila Law, 140 S.

Just because a CEO may informally \nadjudicate an internal employee dispute does not mean the \nCEO is any less the chief executive officer.  It’s part of the job.  \nWhat’s more, Harris has been a productive member of the \nMSPB, participating “in nearly 4,500 decisions” between June \n1, 2022, and February 10, 2025.210  In short, the district court’s \nself-contradictory assertion that the MSPB “does not wield \nsubstantial executive power, but rather spends nearly all of its \ntime adjudicating inward-facing personnel matters involving \nfederal employees,” tends to show that the MSPB does indeed \nexercise substantial executive power.211 \nFinally, the position of the Department of Justice two years \nago in Severino v. Biden, supports at-will removal of MSPB \nmembers.212    There,  DOJ  argued  that  the  President’s \nunrestricted  removal  power  did  not  extend  to  the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States because the \nConference “does not resolve or commence matters for the \nExecutive  Branch  or  determine  anyone’s  rights  or \nobligations.”213  The MSPB,  in  contrast, does  “resolve . . . \n \n209 Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *14. \n210 Id. at *2. \n211 Id. at *6 (cleaned up). \n212 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C.

Irreparable Harm \nA stay applicant must show that it will be irreparably \nharmed absent a stay.216 \nHere, the Government contends that the President suffers \nirreversible  harm  each  day  the  district  courts’  injunctions \nremain in effect because he is deprived of the constitutional \nauthority vested in him alone.  I agree. \n Article II vests the President with the “entire ‘executive \nPower,’”  which  “generally  includes  the  ability  to  remove \nexecutive officials.”217  The district courts’ orders effectively \nnullify that power.  That level of interference is “virtually \nunheard  of,”  and  “it  impinges  on  the  ‘conclusive  and \npreclusive’ power through which the President controls the \n \n214 Id. \n215 Order on Stay Request, Special Counsel ex rel John Doe v. \nDepartment of Agriculture, No. CB-1208-25-0020-U-1 (MSPB Mar. \n5, 2025), https://perma.cc/3F45-PKG5. \n216 Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \n217 Seila Law, 140 S.

Each year, the NLRB oversees tens \nof thousands of unfair labor practice charges and decides (on \naverage) roughly 200 cases.220  Additionally, the NLRB lacks \na quorum without Wilcox, meaning the district court’s order \ntips the scales in favor of political appointees that do not share \nthe President’s policy objectives.  The President’s removal \npower, properly understood, avoids that result.221   \nAs for the MSPB, just this month, upon the motion of a \njudicially reinstated Special Counsel, Harris (also judicially \nreinstated)  stayed  the  termination  of  roughly  6,000 \nprobationary  employees.222    Now,  in  opposing  the \nGovernment’s stay motion, Harris assures us that we need not \nworry about such actions because the President (after action by \nthis court) replaced the Special Counsel.  But even if Harris no \nlonger  has  the  opportunity  to  stay  personnel  actions,  she \n \n218 Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *14, *16 \n(D.C. Cir.

Harm to Removed Officials \nAlthough the two “most critical” factors support issuing \nstays, I also consider whether those stays “will substantially \ninjure the other parties interested in the proceeding.”224 \nThey will not.  Harris and Wilcox identify harms that are \neither incognizable or outweighed by the irreparable harm \nsuffered  by  the  Government  under  the  district  courts’ \ninjunctions.225   \nFirst, Wilcox and Harris assert a statutory right to remain \nin office.  According to Harris, a stay will prevent her “from \nfulfilling  her  duties  while  removed,”  which  she  says  is \nirreparable because she “took an oath of office to fulfill specific \nstatutory functions set out by Congress.”226  Similarly, Wilcox \n \n223  Free  Enterprise  Fund,  537  F.3d  at  689  (Kavanaugh,  J., \ndissenting). \n224 Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \n225  Vague  assertions  about  presidential  removal  committing \n“violence to the statute Congress enacted” will not suffice — even \nsetting aside that an unconstitutional statutory provision cannot be \nvalidly enacted.  See Harris Opp. 23.   \n226 Harris Opp. 23. \n \n\n70a\n46 \nsuggests that her removal “prevents her from carrying out the \nduties Congress has assigned to her.”227 \nThe assertion of a “statutory right” is, of course, entangled \nwith the merits because a statutory right exists only if the \nstatute  is  constitutional.    I’ve  explained  why  the  removal \nprovisions here are likely not constitutional.  And I assume that \nWilcox and Harris each took an oath to “support and defend the \nConstitution.”228  So I’m not convinced that their removals \ninflict any irreparable harm. \nSecond, both Harris and Wilcox allege that if we issue a \nstay,  their  agencies  will  be  harmed.    Specifically,  Wilcox \nargues that she (and the other NLRB commissioners) will be \n“deprived  of  the  ability  to  carry  out  their  congressional \nmandate in protecting labor rights” and “suffer an injury due to \nthe loss of the office’s independence.”229  She adds that her \nremoval “eliminated a quorum, . . . bringing an immediate and \nindefinite halt to the NLRB’s critical work.”230  For her part, \nHarris contends “a stay would mar the very independence that \nCongress  afforded  Harris  and  the  other  members  of  the \nBoard.”231 \nTo begin, those are institutional interests, not personal \ninterests, so we may take them into account only as they relate \nto the public interest.  Even then, this court recently doubted its \nability  to  “balance  [one  agency’s]  asserted  public  interest \nagainst the public interest asserted by the rest of the executive \n \n227 Wilcox Opp. 21 (quoting Harris v.

Public Interest \nStaying  these  cases  pending  appeal  is  in  the  public \ninterest.   The  people  elected  the  President,  not  Harris  or \nWilcox, to execute the nation’s laws.235 \nThe forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed \nprincipal  officer  disenfranchises  voters  by  hampering  the \nPresident’s ability to govern during the four short years the \npeople  have  assigned  him  the  solemn  duty  of  leading  the \nexecutive branch.236  One may honestly believe that labor \ndisputes  and  personnel  matters  are  more  conveniently  or \nefficiently  resolved  by  an  independent  agency,  but \n \n232 Order at 7, Dellinger v.

Conclusion \nThe  district  courts  did  their  level  best  in  rushed \ncircumstances to follow Supreme Court precedent.  But their \nfidelity to that precedent was unduly selective.  By reading \nHumphrey’s Executor in an expansive manner, they read it in a \nmanner that Seila Law and Collins preclude.  Though those \ncases did not overturn Humphrey’s Executor, their holdings \nrelied on an exceptionally narrow reading of it. \nEven the most casual reader will have guessed by now that \nI agree with how Seila Law and Collins read Humphrey’s \nExecutor.  But even if I disagreed with them, this court would \nlack the authority to undo what they did.

The \nCourt first observed that the CFPB is not a multimember expert \nagency because it “is led by a single Director who cannot be \ndescribed as a ‘body of experts’ and cannot be considered ‘non-\npartisan’ in the same sense as a group of officials drawn from \nboth sides of the aisle.”  Id.  The Court then distinguished the \nCFPB from the 1935 FTC—which had been characterized as a \n“mere  legislative  or  judicial  aid”—based  on  three  sets  of \npowers.    Id.    Those  powers  “must  be  exercises  of”  the \n“executive Power” under our constitutional structure but they \n \n\n74a\n2 \ncan “take ‘legislative’ and ‘judicial’ forms.”  Id. at 216 n.2 \n(quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 305 n.4 \n(2013)). \nFirst, in terms of executive power with a legislative form \nthe  CFPB  Director  “possesses  the  authority  to  promulgate \nbinding rules fleshing out 19 federal statutes, including a broad \nprohibition  on  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  in  a  major \nsegment of the U.S. economy.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  \nSecond,  as  to  executive  power  with  a  judicial  form,  “the \nDirector may unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal \nand equitable relief in administrative adjudications.”  Id. at 219.  \nThird,  regarding  purely  executive  power,  “the  Director’s \nenforcement authority includes the power to seek daunting \nmonetary penalties against private parties on behalf of the \nUnited States in federal court—a quintessentially executive \npower not considered in Humphrey’s Executor.”  Id.  Based on \nthe breadth of those three powers, and before going on to raise \nother concerns about the novelty of the CFPB’s structure, the \nCourt held that the CFPB was “[u]nlike the New Deal-era FTC \nupheld [in Humphrey’s].”  Id. at 218. \nThe next question becomes what kind of agency—single- \nor  multi-headed—falls  on  either  side  of  Seila  Law’s \n“substantial executive power” dividing line.  On the one hand, \na plurality of the Seila Law court mused in its discussion of \nseverability that “[o]ur severability analysis does not foreclose \nCongress from pursuing alternative responses to the problem—\nfor  example,  converting  the  CFPB  into  a  multimember \nagency.”  Id. at 237 (Roberts, C.J.).  But simply converting the \nCFPB into a multi-headed agency could not have sufficed \nbecause the Court had earlier explained that the CFPB failed \nthe Humphrey’s “substantial executive power” test.  See Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 218–19 (maj. op.) (explaining why the CFPB \nitself falls outside the Humphrey’s exception).  Perhaps the \n \n\n75a\n3 \nplurality’s dictum in another section of the opinion meant that \nsuch  a  response  would  be  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient \ncondition.  Conversely, Seila Law’s gloss on Humphrey’s did \nuse  the  same  phrase—“substantial  executive  power”—as \nJustice Kavanaugh’s dissent in PHH when he was a judge on \nthis court.  881 F.3d at 167 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  That \nopinion listed both the NLRB and the MSPB as “agencies \nexercising substantial executive authority.”  Id. at 173. \nIn Collins v. Yellen, the Court further explained that “the \nnature and breadth of an agency’s authority is not dispositive \nin determining whether Congress may limit the President’s \npower to remove its head.”  594 U.S. 220, 251–52 (2021).  \nInstead, “[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the relative \nimportance of the regulatory and enforcement  authority of \ndisparate  agencies,  and  we  do  not  think  that  the \nconstitutionality  of  removal  restrictions  hinges  on  such  an \ninquiry.”  Id. at 253; see also id. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring \nin part and concurring in the judgment) (recognizing Collins’ \n“broadening”  of  Seila  Law);  id.  at  293  (Sotomayor,  J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (same).  However, \nCollins  did  not  discuss  Humphrey’s  and  the  Court \ncharacterized its decision as a “straightforward application of \nour reasoning in Seila Law” because the agency there was also \n“led by a single Director.”  Id. at 251 (maj. op.).  Thus, it is not \nclear that Collins’ instruction not to weigh up the nature and \nbreadth  of  an  agency’s  authority  extends  to  multimember \nboards. \nAccordingly,  reasonable  minds  can—and  often  do—\ndisagree  about  the  ongoing  vitality  of  the  Humphrey’s \nexception.  See, e.g., Consumers’ Rsch. v. CPSC, 98 F.4th 646 \n(5th Cir.) (mem.) (splitting 9–8 on whether to grant rehearing \nen  banc  on  the  constitutionality  of  the  Consumer  Product \nSafety  Commission’s  removal  restrictions).    But  simply \n \n\n76a\n4 \napplying Seila Law’s test and examining both the NLRB’s and \nthe MSPB’s executive powers—regardless of their legislative, \njudicial and executive forms—the government has satisfied its \nburden of showing a strong likelihood that they are substantial.  \nBoth Wilcox and Harris concede that their agencies wield \nsubstantial power of an “adjudicative” form—indeed, that is \nhow they hope to fall within the Humphrey’s exception.  We \nmust therefore consider those powers that are of a legislative \nand executive form. \nThe NLRB has traditionally preferred to set precedent by \nadjudicating,  Wilcox  v.  Trump,  2025  WL 720914,  at  *9 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025), but it retains broad authority of a \nlegislative form to promulgate “such rules and regulations as \nmay be necessary to carry out” its statutory mandate, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 156.  Moreover, its regulatory authority over labor relations \naffects a “major segment of the U.S. economy.”  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 218.  Indeed, the district court explained that the \nNLRB was established by the Congress “in response to a long \nand  violent  struggle  for  workers’  rights,”    Wilcox,  2025 \nWL 720914, at *3, and emphasized its indisputably “important \nwork,” id. at *17.  Granted, the NLRB’s executive power is \npartly  bifurcated  because  the  General  Counsel  investigates \ncharges and prosecutes complaints before the Board.  See 29 \nU.S.C. § 153(d).  However, as Judge Walker points out, the \nBoard retains the power to “seek monetary relief like backpay \n‘against private parties on behalf of the United States in federal \ncourt,’  [which  is]  a  ‘quintessentially  executive  power  not \nconsidered in Humphrey’s Executor.’”  Op. (Walker, J.) at 32 \n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219). \nThe MSPB’s powers are relatively more circumscribed.  In \nterms of power of a legislative form, its rulemaking authority \nis limited to issuing “such regulations as may be necessary for \nthe  performance  of  its  functions.”    5  U.S.C.  § 1204(h).  \n \n\n77a\n5 \nHowever, it possesses the negative power, even if rarely used, \nto review sua sponte and invalidate regulations issued by the \nOffice of Personnel Management.  Id. § 1204(f).  As to power \nof  an  executive  form,  at  least  in  certain  circumstances  it \nrepresents itself litigating in federal court.  See Harris Decl. \n¶ 33  (Harris  Opp’n  App.  B  at  7–8);  5  U.S.C.  §§ 1204(i), \n7703(a)(2).  As the Supreme Court stated in Buckley v. Valeo, \n424 U.S. 1, 139–40 (1976), the “responsibility for conducting \ncivil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating \npublic rights” is one of the “executive functions.”  The MSPB’s \nlitigation power also distinguishes it from other agencies that \ncannot be respondents in federal court.  See, e.g., Oil, Chem. & \nAtomic Workers Int’l Union v. OSHRC, 671 F.2d 643, 651–53 \n(D.C. Cir. 1982) (explaining that the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission cannot be a respondent in federal \ncourt and contrasting it with the NLRB).  And Harris as a single \nMSPB member recently wielded considerable power over the \nexecutive by temporarily reinstating thousands of probationary \nemployees.  Order on Stay Request (Mar. 5, 2025) (Harris \nOpp’n App. C).1 \nGranted, in Seila Law the Court distinguished the Office \nof the Special Counsel from the CFPB in part because the OSC \n“does not bind private parties,” 591 U.S. at 221, and the MSPB \nsimilarly operates entirely within the executive branch.  But it \nmay be that the Court was simply highlighting that the CFPB \nposed more of a threat to individual liberty than the OSC rather \nthan diminishing the constitutional problem of dividing power \nwithin the executive branch.  Compare PHH, 881 F.3d at 183 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (emphasizing the CFPB’s structure \n \n1  Indeed,  Harris’s  declaration  recites  that  she  “cannot  issue \nadjudication decisions unilaterally,” Harris Decl. ¶ 26 (Harris Opp’n \nApp. B at 5), thereby conceding that perhaps her most expansive \naction  to  date—“staying”  the  termination  of  executive  branch \nemployees by the thousands—is not in fact adjudicative. \n \n\n78a\n6 \nas a threat to individual liberty), with Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n223  (explaining  that  the  Framers  sought  to  “divide”  the \nlegislative power and “fortif[y]” the executive power) (quoting \nThe Federalist No. 51 (J. Madison)). \nAccordingly, the first Nken factor is a somewhat closer call \nin my view than in Judge Walker’s but the government has met \nits  “strong  showing”  burden  at  this  stage  because  of  the \nsubstantial executive power that the NLRB and MSPB both \nwield. \nB. \nIn addition, the government has more than satisfied its \nburden to show irreparable harm that far outweighs any harm \nto Harris and Wilcox from a stay.  As Harris concedes, the \n“question of whether the government will prevail is distinct \nfrom  whether  the  government  will  suffer  irreparable  harm \nabsent a stay.”  Harris Opp’n 19.  Thus, we consider whether \nany harm suffered by the government can be undone if it \nprevails. \nAs this panel explained in Dellinger v. Bessent, “it is \nimpossible to unwind the days during which a President is \n‘directed to recognize and work with an agency head whom he \nhas already removed.’”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052, slip \nop. at 6 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (alterations omitted) (quoting \nDellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 559669, at *16 (D.C. Cir. Feb. \n15,  2025)  (Katsas,  J.,  dissenting)).    Such  a  requirement \nencroaches  on  the  President’s  “conclusive  and  preclusive” \npower to supervise those wielding executive power on his \nbehalf.  Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 608–09 (2024) \n(citing Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204; Myers, 272 U.S. at 106). \nHarris is also wrong to downplay the government’s injury \nas a “vague assertion of harm to the separation of powers.”  \n \n\n79a\n7 \nHarris Opp’n 20.  In addition to the concrete actions by the \nNLRB and the MSPB that Judge Walker details, Op. (Walker, \nJ.) at 45, the executive branch—not merely the separation of \npowers—is  harmed  through  (1)  a  “[d]iminution  of  the \nPresidency” and (2) a “[l]ack of accountability,” see PHH, 881 \nF.3d at 155–60 (Henderson, J., dissenting). \nFirst, as the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise \nFund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 499 (2010), our “Constitution \nwas  adopted  to  enable  the  people  to  govern  themselves, \nthrough their elected leaders.”  The growth of the “headless \nFourth  Branch”  of  government,  FCC  v.  Fox  Television \nStations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  502,  525–26  (2009)  (Scalia,  J.), \n“heightens the concern that [the Executive Branch] may slip \nfrom the Executive’s control, and thus from that of the people, \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 499.  It is incongruous with the \nPresident’s duty to  “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, that he be “fasten[ed]” with \nprincipal officers who “by their different views of policy might \nmake his taking care that the laws be faithfully executed most \ndifficult or impossible,” Myers, 272 U.S. at 131.  It makes no \ndifference that the President can appoint the chair or other \nmembers of a board to reduce the magnitude or duration of this \ndiminution—it is a diminution nonetheless.  See PHH, 881 \nF.3d at 156–57 (Henderson, J., dissenting) (“Even assuming \nthe CFPB violates Article II only some of the time—a year \nhere, a couple years there—that is not a strong point in its \nfavor.”). \nSecond,  the  Framers  decided  to  check  the  President’s \nuniquely  concentrated  power  by  making  him  “the  most \ndemocratic  and  politically  accountable  official  in \nGovernment.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  That accountability \nis “enhanced by the solitary nature of the Executive Branch, \nwhich  provides  ‘a  single  object  for  the  jealousy  and \n \n\n80a\n8 \nwatchfulness of the people.’”  Id. (quoting The Federalist No. \n70  (A.  Hamilton)).    Accordingly,  the  President  “cannot \ndelegate  ultimate  responsibility  or  the  active  obligation  to \nsupervise that goes with it . . . .”  Id. (quoting Free Enter. Fund, \n561 U.S. at 496–97).  Without the power to remove principal \nofficers, “the President could not be held fully accountable for \ndischarging  his  own  responsibilities;  the  buck  would  stop \nsomewhere else.”  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 514.  That the \nbuck would stop with members of a board rather than a solitary \nagency head obstructing his agenda does not eliminate his \ninjury. \nConversely, both Harris and Wilcox assert harm from their \ninability to perform their official functions in addition to any \nbackpay to which they may be entitled if they prevail.  See \nWilcox Opp’n 21 (arguing harm of deprivation of “statutory \nright to function”)  Harris Opp’n 23 (arguing stay will “prevent \nHarris from fulfilling her duties”).  Indeed, the district courts \nfound injuries to Harris and Wilcox in being deprived of the \n“statutory right to function” as well as distinct injuries to their \nagencies.  Harris v. Bessent, 2025 WL 679303, at *13 (D.D.C. \nMar. 13, 2025) (quoting Berry v. Reagan, 1983 WL 538, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. \nCir. 1983) (per curiam)); see also Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at \n*15–16 (citing Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5).  Needless to say, \nwe are not bound by a vacated district court decision from 40 \nyears ago.  At this stage at least, it is far from clear that Harris \nor Wilcox may assert rights against the executive branch on \nbehalf of their offices or agencies as opposed to themselves \npersonally.  See Op. (Walker, J.) at 46–48. \nFor its part, the government cites Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. \n811, 820 (1997), for the proposition that “public officials have \nno individual right to the powers of their offices.”  Harris Gov’t \nMot. 3; Wilcox Gov’t Mot. 3.  The Supreme Court in Raines \n \n\n81a\n9 \npointed out that if a federal court were to have heard a dispute \nbetween  the  President  and  the  Congress  about  the \nconstitutionality  of  restrictions  on  the  presidential  removal \npower,  it  “would  have  been  improperly  and  unnecessarily \nplunged into the bitter political battle being waged between” \nthem.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 827.  Instead, Presidents wait for “a \nsuit brought by a plaintiff with traditional Article III standing.”  \nId.  Here, we are being asked to enter a political battle between \nthe institutional offices of the NLRB, the MSPB and other \nexecutive-branch officials, including the President. \nThe district court in Harris sought to distinguish Raines by \nobserving that it addressed whether legislators had standing to \nchallenge a vote that did not go their way, that the injury was \ndiffused  across  members  of  the  Congress  and  that  “the \nlegislators did not claim injury arising from ‘something to \nwhich they personally are entitled.’”  2025 WL 679303, at *13 \n(quoting Raines, 521 U.S. at 821).  But the next clause of the \nquoted language reads:  “such as their seats as Members of \nCongress after their constituents had elected them.”  Raines, \n521 U.S. at 821.  Here, voters elected the President, not Harris \nor Wilcox.  As in Raines, Harris’s and Wilcox’s “injury thus \nruns (in a sense) with the Member’s seat, a seat which the \nMember holds (it may quite arguably be said) as trustee . . . , \nnot  as  a  prerogative  of  personal  power.”    Id.  (citing  The \nFederalist No. 62 (J. Madison)).  Moreover, in Raines the \nlegislators  “had  not  been  authorized  to  represent  their \nrespective Houses of Congress in th[e] action, and indeed both \nHouses actively oppose[d] their suit.”  Id. at 829.  Here, there \nis at least a serious question whether Harris and Wilcox seek to \nvindicate personal rights or only those of the office and agency, \nand their suits are actively opposed by their own branch of \ngovernment. \n \n\n82a\n10 \nAs we recently explained in Dellinger, “[a]t worst” Harris \nand Wilcox “would remain out of office for a short period of \ntime.”  Dellinger, slip op. at 7.  Because we have ordered highly \nexpedited merits briefing with the agreement of the parties, that \nperiod is particularly brief.  See Order, Wilcox v. Trump, No. \n25-5057 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 18, 2025); Order, Harris v. Bessent, \nNo. 25-5037 &  25-5055 (D.C. Cir.  Mar. 18, 2025).   “By \ncontrast, the potential injury to the government of . . . having \nto  try  and  unravel  [Harris’s  and  Wilcox’s]  actions  is \nsubstantial.”  Dellinger, slip op. at 7.  Thus, even if the first \nNken factor is not a lead-pipe cinch, the injury-focused factors \nplainly favor a stay. \nC. \nIn terms of the public interest, and as we explained in \nDellinger, it is not clear how we could balance Harris’s and \nWilcox’s asserted public interest on behalf of the MSPB and \nNLRB continuing to function as the Congress intended against \nthe public interest asserted by the rest of the executive branch.  \nSee  Dellinger,  slip  op.  at  7.    And  of  course,  “[o]nly  the \nPresident (along with the Vice President) is elected by the \nentire Nation.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  At minimum, this \nfactor does not weigh in Harris’s and Wilcox’s favor. \n* * * \nAccordingly, the government has met its burden for grants \nof a stay during the pendency of these appeals. \n \n\n83a\n \nMILLETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  The  two opinions \nvoting  to  grant  a  stay  rewrite  controlling  Supreme  Court \nprecedent and ignore binding rulings of this court, all in favor \nof putting this court in direct conflict with at least two other \ncircuits.  The stay decision also marks the first time in history \nthat a court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, has licensed the \ntermination of members of multimember adjudicatory boards \nstatutorily protected by the very type of removal restriction the \nSupreme Court has twice unanimously upheld.   \n \nWhat is more, the stay order strips the National Labor \nRelations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board of the \nquora that the district courts’ injunctions preserved, disabling \nagencies that Congress created and funded from acting for as \nlong as the President wants them out of commission.  That \ndecision will leave languishing hundreds of unresolved legal \nclaims  that  the  Political  Branches  jointly  and  deliberately \nchanneled to these expert adjudicatory entities.  In addition, the \nmajority decisions’ rationale openly calls into question the \nconstitutionality of dozens of federal statutes conditioning the \nremoval  of  officials  on  multimember  decision-making \nbodies—everything from the Federal Reserve Board and the \nNuclear  Regulatory  Commission  to  the  National \nTransportation Safety Board and the Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims.   \n \nThat would be an extraordinary decision for a lower federal \ncourt to make under any circumstances.  But what makes it \neven more striking is that all we are supposed to decide today \nis whether a stay pending appeal should issue.  As to that \nnarrow question, the stay decision is an unprecedented and, in \nmy view, wholly unwarranted use of this court’s stay power, \nwhich is meant only to maintain the status quo pending an \nappeal.    See Nken  v.  Holder,  556  U.S.  418,  429 \n(2009) (“A stay simply  suspend[s]  judicial  alteration  of \nthe status quo,” which is defined as “the state of affairs before \nthe  removal  order[s]  [were]  entered.”)  (citation  omitted); \n \n\n84a\n2 \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, \nInc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (A stay pending appeal \nis “preventative, or protective; it seeks to maintain the status \nquo pending a final determination of the merits of the suit.”); \nsee also Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733–734 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (“[T]he status quo [i]s ‘the last peaceable \nuncontested status’ existing between the parties before the \ndispute  developed.”)  (quoting  11A  Charles  Alan  Wright, \nArthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 2948 (3d ed. 1998)).   \n \nI cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary \nfirst-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the \nlaw that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap \nin legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the \nlaw says must go to these boards for the resolution of their \nemployment disputes.  I would deny a stay. \n \nI \n \nA \n \nThese cases arise out of the summary termination, without \nnotice, of two members of multimember adjudicatory bodies \nthat Congress created to resolve disputes impartially and free \nof political influence for reasons of grave national importance. \n \n  Cathy Harris is a member of the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard (“MSPB”).  The MSPB is an adjudicatory body that \nprimarily  reviews  federal  employees’  appeals  alleging  that \ntheir government employer discriminated against them based \non  their  race,  color,  gender,  political  affiliation,  religion, \nnational  origin,  age,  disability,  or  marital  status;  retaliated \nagainst  them  for  whistleblowing;  failed  to  comply  with \nprotections for veterans; or otherwise subjected them to an \n \n\n85a\n3 \nadverse employment action, such as termination, suspension, \nor a reduction in pay grade, 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(a)(1); 1221; \n2302(b)(1), (8)–(9); 3330a(d); 7512. \n \nThe MSPB has three members who are appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate to serve \nseven-year terms.  5 U.S.C. §§ 1201, 1202(a)–(c).  No more \nthan two members of the MSPB may belong to the same \npolitical party.  Id. § 1201.  The President can also appoint one \nof the members, with the advice and consent of the Senate, as \nthe Chair of the MSPB.  Id. § 1203(a).  MSPB members may \nbe  removed  only  for  “inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.”  Id. § 1202(d). \n \n  Gwynne Wilcox is a member, and former Chair, of the \nNational Labor Relations Board (“NRLB”), which Congress \ncharged with “prevent[ing] any person from engaging in any \nunfair labor practice[.]”  29 U.S.C. § 160(a).  The NLRB has \ntwo distinct parts.  The five-member Board, on which Wilcox \nsits, adjudicates appeals of labor disputes from administrative \nlaw judges.  Id. § 153(a).  Separately, the NLRB General \nCounsel prosecutes unfair labor-practice charges.  Id. § 153(d); \nsee also NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 139 \n(1975).    These  two  divisions  of  the  Board  operate \nindependently.  NLRB. v. United Food & Com. Workers Union, \nLoc. 23, AFL-CIO, 484 U.S. 112, 118 (1987). \n \nWhen reviewing administrative law judge decisions, the \nNLRB reviews the entire record, receives briefing, and issues \nits own decision on both the facts and the law.  29 U.S.C. \n§ 160(c); 29 C.F.R. § 101.12.  The Board may issue a cease-\nand-desist order to halt unfair labor practices, or it may issue \nan order requiring reinstatement of terminated employees, with \nor without backpay, and similar equitable remedies.  29 U.S.C. \n \n\n86a\n4 \n§ 160(c).  These orders, however, are not self-executing.  They \nare enforceable only by a federal court.  Id. § 160(e). \n \nThe President appoints NLRB members with the advice \nand consent of the Senate, and the members serve staggered \nfive-year  terms.    29  U.S.C.  § 153(a).    The  President  also \ndesignates one of the members to serve as Chair.  Id.  Congress \nlimited the President’s power to remove a Board member to \n“neglect  of  duty  or  malfeasance  in  office,”  and  required \nadvance notice and a hearing.  Id.  In contrast, the President \nmay remove the General Counsel at will.  See id. § 153(d).   \n \nB \n \n1 \n \nCathy Harris began her seven-year term as a member of the \nMSPB in June 2022.  On February 10, 2025, Harris received \nan  email  from  the  White  House  Office  of  Presidential \nPersonnel stating:  “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I \nam writing to inform you that your position on the Merit \nSystems  Protection  Board  is  terminated,  effective \nimmediately.”  Declaration of Cathy Harris (“Harris Decl.”) \n¶ 4.  The email did not allege any inefficiency, neglect of duty, \nor malfeasance on Harris’s part. \n \nHarris filed suit on February 11th, challenging her removal \nas  ultra  vires,  unconstitutional,  and  a  violation  of  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  She sought relief under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, issuance of a writ of mandamus, \nand equitable  relief.   The district court  awarded summary \njudgment to Harris and granted a permanent injunction and \ndeclaratory relief maintaining her in office.  Harris v. Bessent, \n__ F. Supp. 3d __, No. 25-cv-412 (RC), 2025 WL 679303, at \n*3 (D.D.C. March 4, 2025).  The court added that, if equitable \n \n\n87a\n5 \nrelief were “unavailable[,]” it would issue a writ of mandamus \n“as an alternative remedy at law.”  Id. at *15. \n \n2 \n \n  Gwynne Wilcox was confirmed in September 2023 for her \nsecond term as a member of the NLRB.  President Biden \ndesignated her Chair of the Board in December 2024.  On \nJanuary 27, 2025, Wilcox received an email from the White \nHouse Office of Presidential Personnel stating that she was \n“hereby removed from the office of Member[] of the National \nLabor Relations Board.”  Declaration of Gwynne Wilcox Ex. \nA, at 1.  Wilcox did not receive the statutorily required advance \nnotice of her termination, and the email did not offer Wilcox a \nhearing or claim any neglect of duty or malfeasance on her part.  \nId.; see also Motions Hearing Tr. 51:6–14 (March 5, 2025) \n(government acknowledging that Wilcox was not “removed for \nany neglect or malfeasance”). \n \nWilcox  sued  President  Trump  and  the  new  Board \nChairman, Marvin Kaplan, on February 5th, alleging that her \nremoval  violated  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act.    Her \ncomplaint sought an injunction directing Kaplan to reinstate \nher as a member of the Board.  Because the suit involved only \nquestions  of  law,  Wilcox  promptly  moved  for  expedited \nsummary  judgment.    The  district  court  granted  summary \njudgment for Wilcox, holding that her removal was unlawful \nand issued a permanent injunction maintaining her in office.  \nWilcox v. Trump, __ F. Supp. 3d__, No. 25-cv-334 (BAH), \n2025 WL 720914, at *5, 18 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n88a\n6 \n3 \n \nThe government appealed the judgments in both Harris’s \nand Wilcox’s cases and seeks a stay of the district courts’ \njudgments. \n \nII \n \nA  stay  pending  appeal  is  an  “extraordinary”  remedy.  \nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election \nComm’n, 904 F.3d 1014, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam).  \nTo obtain such exceptional relief, the stay applicant must (1) \nmake a “strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the \nmerits”  of  the  appeal;  (2)  demonstrate  that  it  will  be \n“irreparably injured” before the appeal concludes; (3) show \nthat issuing a stay will not “substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding”; and (4) establish that “the public \ninterest” favors a stay.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hilton \nv. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \n \nThe government has satisfied none of those stay factors.  \nFirst, the government has failed to make any showing, let alone \na “strong showing[,] that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits” \nin its appeal to this court.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; see also id. \n(the likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable injury \nare the “most critical” factors).  Controlling Supreme Court \nprecedents—Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. \n602  (1935),  and  Wiener  v.  United  States,  357  U.S.  349 \n(1958)—establish  that  the  MSPB  and  NLRB’s  for-cause \nremoval protections are constitutional.  Circuit precedent binds \nthis  panel  to  that  same  conclusion.    In  addition,  the \ngovernment’s  efforts  to  de-constitutionalize  those  statutory \nprotections are unlikely to succeed given the long tradition of \nremoval limitations and their particular justifications.   \n \n \n\n89a\n7 \nSecond, the government has not identified any irreparable \nharm that would arise from a stay while these appeals are \nexpeditiously  decided.    Its  argument  that  the  President’s \nremoval power is irreparably impaired depends entirely on this \ncourt overturning Supreme Court rulings holding that these \nremoval protections do not unconstitutionally encroach on the \nPresident’s power. \n \nThird, the balance of harms to the plaintiffs and the public \ninterest weighs strongly against a stay.   \n \nIII \n \nA \n \nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Humphrey’s Executor \nand Wiener squarely foreclose the government’s arguments on \nappeal.  In those cases, the Supreme Court unanimously held \nthat  for-cause  removal  protections  like  those  applicable  to \nMSPB and NLRB members were constitutional as applied to \nofficials on multimember independent agencies that exercise \nquasi-adjudicatory and quasi-legislative functions within the \nExecutive Branch—just like those undertaken by the MSPB \nand NLRB.  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624; Wiener, \n357 U.S. at 355–356.   \n \nIn Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court upheld for-\ncause removal protections for members of the Federal Trade \nCommission (“FTC”).  295 U.S. at 620.  The Court reasoned \nthat,  as  a  five-member  board  with  no  more  than  three \ncommissioners from the same political party, the FTC was \ndesigned to be “nonpartisan” and “act with entire impartiality.”  \nId. at 619–620, 624.  In addition, the FTC was “charged with \nthe enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law.”  Id. \nat 624.   \n \n\n90a\n8 \n \nIn  that  way,  the  FTC’s  functions  were  held  to  be \n“predominantly  quasi-judicial  and  quasi-legislative.”  \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.  The Commission’s \nfunctions  were  quasi-judicial  because  it  could  hold \n“hearing[s]”  on  claims  alleging  “unfair  methods  of \ncompetition,” prepare “report[s] in writing stating its findings \nas to the facts,” and “issue * * * cease and desist order[s,]” \nwhich  only  federal  courts  (and  not  the  FTC  itself)  could \nenforce.  Id. at 620–622, 628.  The FTC was quasi-legislative, \nin that the Commission “fill[ed] in and administer[ed] the \ndetails”  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act  and  made \n“investigations  and  reports  * * *  for  the  information  of \nCongress[.]”  Id. at 628.   \n \nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed Humphrey’s Executor two \ndecades later.  In Wiener, the Court upheld for-cause removal \nprotections for members of the War Claims Commission—a \nthree-member body that adjudicated Americans’ injury and \nproperty claims against Nazi Germany and its allies.  357 U.S. \nat 350.  The Court concluded that the Commission could not \naccomplish  its  adjudicatory  function—fairly  applying \n“evidence and governing legal considerations” to the “merits” \nof claims—without some protection against removal.  Id. at \n355–356.    The  Constitution,  the  Court  held,  permitted \nsheathing “the Damocles’ sword of removal” by instituting for-\ncause protections for Commission members.  Id. at 356. \n \nThe Wiener Court also clarified what qualifies as a “quasi-\njudicial”  function.    It  explained  that,  even  though  the \nCommission was part of the Executive Branch, its role was \npurely adjudicatory because Congress “chose to establish a \nCommission to ‘adjudicate according to law’ the classes of \nclaims defined in the statute[.]”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 355.  That \n \n\n91a\n9 \ndemonstrated the “intrinsic judicial character of the task with \nwhich the Commission was charged.”  Id. \n \nB \n \nHumphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener  are  precedential \ndecisions that bind this court.  Even as the Supreme Court has \nrejected more modern and novel constraints on the removal of \nsingle  heads  of  agencies  exercising  substantial  executive \npower, its modern precedent has consistently announced that \nHumphrey’s  Executor  remains  “in  place[.]”    Seila  Law  v. \nCFPB,  591  U.S.  197,  215  (2020);  see  id.  at  228  (“not \nrevisit[ing] Humphrey’s Executor”); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 250–251 (2021) (recognizing that Seila Law did “not \nrevisit [] prior decisions”) (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204); \nsee also Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 687 (1988) (in case \ninvolving  restrictions  on  removal  of  an  inferior  officer, \nrecognizing that Humphrey’s Executor remains good law); see \ngenerally Free Enter. Fund v. Public Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 \nU.S. 477, 483 (2010) (in case involving multimember board, \ndeclining to “reexamine” Humphrey’s Executor); id. at 501 \n(“[W]e  do  not”  “take  issue  with  for-cause  limitations  in \ngeneral[.]”). \n \nFree Enterprise Fund, for example, held unconstitutional \ndouble-layered  for-cause  removal  protections.    That  is, \nMembers of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \ncould be removed only for cause by the Securities Exchange \nCommission,  whose  members,  in  turn,  the  Court  accepted \ncould be removed by the President only for cause.  Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 484–487.  The Supreme Court held that a \ntwice-restricted removal power imposed too great a constraint \non the President’s authority.  Id. at 492.   \n \n \n\n92a\n10 \nIn devising a remedy, the Supreme Court left the Securities \nand Exchange Commission’s accepted single-layer removal \nprotections intact; only the Board’s protections were stricken.  \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 492, 495, 509.  The Court found \nthis would be a sufficient constitutional remedy because, even \nwith  the  Commissioners  enjoying  for-cause  protection,  the \nPresident could “then hold the Commission to account for its \nsupervision of the Board, to the same extent that he may hold \nthe Commission to account for everything else it does.”  Id. at \n495–496.    In  so  ruling,  the  Court  repeated  the  rule  from \nHumphrey’s  Executor  that  “Congress  can,  under  certain \ncircumstances, create independent agencies run by principal \nofficers appointed by the President, whom the President may \nnot remove at will but only for good cause.”  Id. at 483. \n \nSeila Law likewise repeated that Humphrey’s  Executor \nremains governing precedent.  In that case, the Supreme Court \ninvalidated the removal protections for the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”)’s single director because she had \n“sole  responsibility  to  administer  19  separate  consumer-\nprotections  statutes”  and  could  “unilaterally,  without \nmeaningful  supervision,  issue  final  regulations,  oversee \nadjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, \nand determine what penalties to impose on private parties.”  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 219, 225.  Structural features of the \nCFPB further insulated the director from presidential control.  \nBecause the agency was headed by one director with a five-\nyear term, “some Presidents may not have any opportunity to \nshape its leadership and thereby influence its activities.”  Id. at \n225.  The CFPB also receives its funding from the Federal \nReserve  Board,  which  is  funded  outside  of  the  annual \nappropriations process, further diluting presidential oversight.  \nId. at 226. \n \n \n\n93a\n11 \nImportantly, the Supreme Court’s decision was explicit that \nHumphrey’s Executor remains “in place.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 215; id. at 228 (“[W]e do not revisit Humphrey’s Executor \nor any other precedent today[.]”).  In fact, in Seila Law, three \nJustices invited Congress to “remedy[] the [CFPB’s] defect” by \n“converting the CFPB into a multimember agency,” id. at 237 \n(Roberts, C.J., joined by Alito and Kavanaugh, JJ., concurring \nin the judgment), and four more Justices agreed that such a \nredesign would be constitutional, id. at 298 (Kagan, J., joined \nby Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., concurring in the \njudgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part). \n \nMost recently, the Supreme Court’s decision in Collins, \nwhich struck down another single-headed agency performing \npredominantly executive functions, also acknowledged that \nHumphrey’s Executor remained precedential.  Collins, 594 \nU.S. at 250–251. \n \nC \n \nUnder  the  precedent  set  in  Humphrey’s  Executor  and \nWiener, and preserved in Free Enterprise Fund, Seila Law, and \nCollins,  the  MSPB  and  NLRB  removal  protections  are \nconstitutional.   \n \n1 \n \nThe MSPB is a “multimember expert agenc[y] that do[es] \nnot wield substantial executive power[.]”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 218.  No more than two of its three members may hail from \nthe same political party.  5 U.S.C. § 1201; see also Humphrey’s \nExecutor,  295  U.S.  at  624  (“The  commission  is  to  be \nnonpartisan[.]”).  MSPB members serve staggered seven-year \nterms, giving each President the “opportunity to shape [the \nBoard’s] leadership and thereby influence its activities.”  Seila \n \n\n94a\n12 \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 225.  President Trump, in fact, will be able to \nappoint at least two of the MSPB’s three members.   \n \nIn  the  government’s  own  words,  the  MSPB  is \n“predominantly an adjudicatory body.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 12:19–\n23.  The MSPB has no investigatory or prosecutorial role.  \nInstead,  it  hears  disputes  between  federal  employees  and \nfederal agencies.  5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(a)(1), 7701(a).  As such, \nthe MSPB is passive and must wait for appeals to be initiated \neither by employees who have suffered an adverse employment \naction,  discrimination,  or  whistleblower  retaliation,  or  by \nemploying agencies or the Office of Special Counsel.  Id. \n§§ 1204(a)(1), 1214(b)(1)(a); 5 C.F.R. § 1201.3; see Seila Law, \n591  U.S.  at  219–220  (reiterating  the  constitutionality  of \nremoval protections for an officer who wielded “core executive \npower” because “that power, while significant, was trained \ninward  to  high-ranking  Governmental  actors  identified  by \nothers, and was confined to a specified matter in which the \nDepartment of Justice had a potential conflict of interest”).1   \n \nLike the War Claims Commission in Wiener, the MSPB \nmust  “‘adjudicate  according  to  law’  the  classes  of  claims \ndefined in the statute[.]”  357 U.S. at 355.  That confirms the \n“intrinsic judicial character of the task with which” the MSPB \nis “charged.”  Id. \n \n \n1 In the exercise of its adjudicatory authority, the MSPB has \nlimited jurisdiction.  Only civil servants that fall within the statutorily \ndefined  term  “employee”  can  seek  its  review.    5  U.S.C. \n§§ 7511(a)(1), 7701(a); see also Roy v. MSPB, 672 F.3d 1378, 1380 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012).  That definition excludes, among other categories, \npolitical appointees and civil servants in “probationary” or “trial \nperiod[s]” of employment.  5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1); see also Roche v. \nMSPB, 596 F.3d 1375, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \n \n\n95a\n13 \nThe history of the MSPB as a bifurcated entity reinforces \nits almost exclusively adjudicatory role.  In 1978, Congress \ndivided  the  Civil  Service  Commission  into  the  Office  of \nPersonnel Management and the MSPB.  Civil Service Reform \nAct of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 201, 92 Stat. 1111, 1119.  \nThe  Office  of  Personnel  Management  was  tasked  with \n“executing, administering, and enforcing * * * civil service \nrules and regulations[,]” while the MSPB—then, as now—was \ntasked with adjudicating disputes.  Id. § 202, 92 Stat. at 1122. \n \nOnce the MSPB issues decisions, federal agencies and \nemployees are expected to “comply” with its orders, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(a)(2), but the MSPB has no independent means of \nenforcing its orders.  Cf. Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at \n620–621 (FTC cease-and-desist orders could only be enforced \nby  application  “to  the  appropriate  Circuit  Court  of \nAppeals[.]”).  \n  \nIn addition, most MSPB decisions are subject to Article III \nreview.  Employees can appeal to federal court any decision \nthat “adversely affect[s] or aggrieve[s]” them, and the Director \nof the Office of Personnel Management can petition for judicial \nreview of any MSPB decision that the Director believes is \nerroneous and “will have a substantial impact on a civil service \nlaw,  rule,  regulation,  or  policy  directive.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 7703(a)(1), (d)(1). \n \nThe MSPB has limited rulemaking authority to prescribe \nonly those regulations “necessary for the performance of its \nfunctions,” many of which are akin to the federal rules of \nprocedure  and  local  rules  that  courts  adopt.    5  U.S.C. \n§ 1204(h); see,  e.g., 5  C.F.R. §§ 1201.14 (electronic filing \nprocedures),  1201.23  (computation  of  time  for  deadlines), \n1201.26 (service of pleadings).  It also must prepare “special \nstudies” and “reports” on the civil service for the President and \n \n\n96a\n14 \nCongress,  5  U.S.C.  § 1204(a)(3),  but  these  are  just \n“recommendations[,]”  carry  no  force  of  law,  and  are  not \nenforced by the MSPB, Harris Decl. ¶ 30; see Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 621 (citing 15 U.S.C. § 46).  In addition, \nthe MSPB remains accountable to the President and Congress \nthrough the appropriations process.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 118-\n47,  138  Stat.  557  (2024).    That  affords  the  President  an \n“opportunity to recommend or veto spending bills” to fund its \noperations.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 226. \n \n2 \n \nThe NLRB also fits the Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener \nmold.  Indeed, Congress enacted the National Labor Relations \nAct,  which  created  the  NLRB,  just  over  a  month  after \nHumphrey’s Executor was decided and modeled the statute on \nthe FTC’s organic statute.  Compare National Labor Relations \nAct, Pub. L. No. 74-198, 49 Stat. 449 (1935), with An Act to \ncreate a Federal Trade Commission, Pub. L. No. 63-203, 38 \nStat. 717 (1914); see also J. Warren Madden, Origin and Early \nYears of the National Labor Relations Act, 18 HASTINGS L.J. \n571, 572–573 (1967).   \n \nAs designed, the NLRB is a “multimember” agency that \ndoes “not wield substantial executive power[.]”  Seila Law, 591 \nU.S.  at  218.    It  is  composed  of  five  members  that  serve \nstaggered five-year terms, thus affording each President the \nchance to affect its composition.  29 U.S.C. § 153(a); see also \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  Though the Act does not require \nthe  Board’s  members  to  be  balanced  across  party  lines, \nPresidents since Eisenhower have adhered to a “tradition” of \nappointing no more than three members from their own party.  \nBrian D. Feinstein & Daniel J. Hemel, Partisan Balance with \nBite, 118 COLUM. L. REV. 9, 54–55 (2018).  No one disputes \n \n\n97a\n15 \nthat continues to be the case with the current Board of which \nWilcox is a member. \n \nThe NLRB is predominantly an adjudicatory body.  It hears \ncomplaints alleging unfair labor practices by employers and \nlabor  unions.    Glacier  Northwest  v.  International  Bhd.  of \nTeamsters Loc. Union No. 174, 598 U.S. 771, 775–776 (2023).  \nIt  can  issue  cease-and-desist  orders  aimed  at  unfair  labor \npractices and orders requiring reinstatement or backpay.  29 \nU.S.C. § 160(c).  These orders, however, are not independently \nenforceable.  They must be given legal force by a federal court \nof appeals.  Id. at §§ 154(a), 160(e); see also Dish Network \nCorp. v NLRB, 953 F.3d 370, 375 n.2 (5th Cir. 2020) (The \nNLRB  “needs  a  court’s  imprimatur  to  render  its  orders \nenforceable.”).  In addition, any person “aggrieved” by an \nNLRB decision may obtain judicial review in federal court.  29 \nU.S.C. § 160(f).   \n \nConspicuously absent from the NLRB’s authority is any \npower to investigate or prosecute cases.  That authority is left \nto the (removable-at-will) General Counsel.  See 29 U.S.C. \n§ 153(d).  So the NLRB’s powers are less than those of the FTC  \nin  Humphrey’s  Executor  because  the  FTC  could  launch \ninvestigations “at its own instance[.]”  Brief for Samuel F. \nRathbun, Executor, at 46 n.21, Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. \n602 (1935) (No. 667); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219 n.4 \n(“[W]hat matters” for assessing Humphrey’s Executor “is the \nset  of  powers  the  Court  considered  as  the  basis  for  its \ndecision[.]”).   \n \nLike the MSPB, the NLRB is funded through congressional \nappropriations. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 698 \n(2024).  Also like the MSPB, the NLRB has circumscribed \nrulemaking authority.  It can issue rules and regulations that are \nnecessary to carry out its statutory duties.  29 U.S.C. § 156.  As \n \n\n98a\n16 \npart of this authority, the NLRB may promulgate interpretive \nrules  “advis[ing]  the  public  of  [its]  construction”  of  the \nNational Labor Relations Act, Shalala v. Guernsey Mem’l \nHosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99 (1994) (citation omitted), but Article III \ncourts  review  those  interpretations  de  novo,  Loper  Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024). \n \nD \n \nAll of that makes the answer to the question whether the \ngovernment is likely to succeed in its appeal an easy “No.”  The \nunanimous holdings in Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener that \nremoval  restrictions  on  multimember,  non-partisan  bodies \nengaged  predominantly  in  adjudicatory  functions  are \nconstitutional bind this court, especially in light of the Supreme \nCourt’s repeated preservation of that precedent and Seila Law’s \nexpress invitation for Congress to change the CFPB into a \nmultimember body.   \n \nThe government and my colleagues’ opinions press two \ncentral arguments to escape this binding authority, but neither \naffords the government a likelihood of success on appeal. \n \n1 \n \nTo  start,  the  government  and  the  opinions  of  Judges \nHenderson and Walker try to distinguish the MSPB and NLRB \nfrom  the  multimember  agencies  at  issue  in  Humphrey’s \nExecutor and Wiener.  But those efforts do not work.   \n \nThe government casts the MSPB as exercising executive \nauthority  because  the  MSPB  “hear[s]”  and  “adjudicate[s]” \nmatters, is authorized to take “final action” on those matters, \n“issue[s]”  remedies,  and  orders  “compliance”  with  its \n \n\n99a\n17 \ndecisions.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 12 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(a)(1)–(2)).  \n \nTrue—the MSPB does do those things.  But those are the \nhallmarks  of  an  adjudicative  body.    The  War  Claims \nCommission was an “adjudicatory body[,]” and it issued final \nand unreviewable decisions that ordered funds to be paid from \nthe Treasury Department’s War Claims Fund.  Wiener, 357 \nU.S. at 354–356.  The decisions of the MSPB and NLRB, more \nmodestly, can only be enforced by a federal court.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 1204(a)(2), 7703 (MSPB); 29 U.S.C. § 160(e) (NLRB). \n \nThe government points out that the MSPB can invalidate \nrules issued by the Office of Personnel Management.  Gov’t \nStay Mot. in Harris 12 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1204(f)).  But the \nMSPB can invalidate only those rules that are themselves \ninherently unlawful because they would require employees to \nviolate the law by engaging in discriminatory, retaliatory, or \nother impermissible conduct.  5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(f)(2), 2302(b).  \nNeedless to say, that type of invalidation is an “exceedingly \nrare occurrence,” Harris Decl. ¶ 31, and could not trench upon \nany  lawful  exercise  of  the  President’s  duty  to  “faithfully \nexecute” the laws of the United States, U.S. CONST. Art. II, § 3.  \nAnd the government nowhere disclaims its ability to obtain \njudicial review of such a decision.  See generally 5 U.S.C. \n§ 7703(d)(1). \n \nThe government also highlights that MSPB attorneys, as \nopposed  to  lawyers  from  the  Department  of  Justice,  may \nrepresent the Board in civil actions in the lower federal courts.  \nGov’t Mot. in Harris 12 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1204(i)).  But that is \nalso true of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 U.S.C. § 248(p), and \nthe  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  whose  removal \nprotections the Supreme Court took as given as part of the \nconstitutional remedy adopted in Free Enterprise, 15 U.S.C. \n \n\n100a\n18 \n§§ 77t(b)–(c),  78u(c)–(e).    Anyhow,  independent  litigating \nauthority is not uniquely executive in character.  The Political \nBranches have statutorily authorized the Senate Legal Counsel \nand the General Counsel of the House to represent the Senate \nand  House,  respectively,  in  court  proceedings.    2  U.S.C. \n§§ 288c, 5571(a). \n \nFinally,  Judge  Walker  claims  that  the  MSPB  wields \nexecutive power because “it can force the President to work \nwith thousands of employees he doesn’t want to work with[.]”  \nJ. Walker Op. 40–41.  The assertion that the President could \nfire every single employee in the Executive Branch, as opposed \nto principal officers, is a breathtaking broadside on the very \nexistence  of  a  civil  service  that  not  even  the  government \nadvances.    And  Judge  Walker  cites  no  authority  for  that \nproposition, which is odd given that the only issue before us is \nthe likelihood of the government’s success on appeal on the \narguments it advances.   \n \nAnyhow, his point proves the opposite.  Issuing an order \nthat an employee was unlawfully discharged is intrinsically \nadjudicative.  Federal courts often conclude that employment \ndischarges by the federal government were contrary to law and \norder employees reinstated.  See, e.g., Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 \nU.S. 535, 546 (1959) (reversing lower courts and ordering \nreinstatement of Department of Interior employee who was \nfired without procedurally proper notice or hearing); Lander v. \nLujan, 888 F.2d 153, 158 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (affirming district \ncourt order reinstating Bureau of Mines employee to position \nhe was demoted from in violation of Title VII); American \nPostal Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. United States Postal Serv., \n830 F.2d 294, 312 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (finding Postal Worker \ndischarged in violation of the First Amendment was entitled to \nreinstatement and back pay).   \n \n \n\n101a\n19 \nJudge Walker’s opinion also overlooks that the MSPB has \nno legal authority to “force” its decisions on anybody as it has \nno enforcement arm or sanctions to impose for noncompliance.  \nOnly a federal court can do that.  And even then, the decisions \nonly “force” the President to work with individuals whom the \nPresident  cannot  legally  fire  under  the  anti-discrimination, \nwhistleblower-protection, and veterans-preference laws that he \nhas sworn to uphold.  So just like the FTC, the MSPB’s charge \nis “the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law.”  \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.   \n \nAs for the NLRB, the government insists that the Board is \nnot  “hermetically  sealed”  off  from  the  General  Counsel’s \nenforcement functions.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 16.  In \nparticular,  the  government  argues  that  the  Board,  not  the \nGeneral Counsel, may seek injunctions against unfair labor \npractices in federal court.  Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 160(j)).  My \ncolleagues’ opinions likewise note that the NLRB can seek \nbackpay against private parties in federal court.  J. Walker Op. \n33–34; J. Henderson Op. 4. \n \nBut the Board’s power to seek injunctions in federal court \nmirrors the 1935 FTC’s power to “apply” to circuit courts for \n“enforcement”  of  cease-and-desist  orders.    Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 620–621.  In any event, the Board cannot \nact until the General Counsel does.  The Board may seek an \ninjunction only upon the “issuance of a complaint[,]” 29 U.S.C. \n§ 160(j), which the General Counsel has “final authority” to \nissue or not, id. § 153(d).  As for backpay, such equitable relief \nmust be sought by the General Counsel who alone supervises \nthe attorneys representing the NLRB in federal court.  Id.   \n \nLastly,  Judge  Walker’s  opinion  says  that  having  an \nintrinsically  adjudicatory  function  like  the  War  Claims \nCommission  in  Wiener  does  not  count  because  the \n \n\n102a\n20 \nCommission’s work was “temporary.”  J. Walker Op. 40.  The \nopinion  nowhere  explains  why  the  length  of  an  agency’s \nmandate matters constitutionally.  If Congress established an \nagency to run the military, gave its directors for-cause removal \nprotection, but limited its operation to two years, that agency \nwould trench on the President’s Article II authority far more \nthan the NLRB or MSPB ever could.  In any event, if time \nmatters, Harris’s and Wilcox’s remaining tenures in office \nwould be shorter than those of the War Claims Commissioners.  \nSee War Claims Act of 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-896, § 2(a), (c)–\n(d), 62 Stat. 1240, 1241 (The War Claims Commissioners were \noriginally authorized to serve up to five-year terms). \n \nIn  short,  none  of  the  government’s  arguments  or  my \ncolleagues’ opinions distinguish the MSPB or NLRB in any \nmaterially relevant way from the Supreme Court’s holdings in \nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener.   \n \n2 \n \na \n \nAs their second tack, the government and my colleagues’ \nopinions take aim at Humphrey’s Executor.  The government \nsays that decision has effectively been overruled and confined \nto its facts because its conclusion about the nature of the FTC’s \nexecutive power “has not withstood the test of time.”  Gov’t \nStay Mot. in Harris 15 (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216 n.2); \nsee also Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 14.   \n \nThe Supreme Court expressly rejected this argument in \nMorrison.    See  Morrison,  487  U.S.  at  686–691,  689  n.28 \n(applying Humphrey’s Executor even though the “powers of \nthe FTC at the time of Humphrey’s Executor would at the \npresent  time  be  considered  ‘executive,’  at  least  to  some \n \n\n103a\n21 \ndegree”).  That ruling binds this court.  Plus that argument has \nnothing to say about the controlling force of Wiener, which \ninvolved a predominantly adjudicatory body much more akin \nto the NLRB and MSPB.   \n \nIt is this court’s job to apply Supreme Court precedent, not \nto cast it aside or to declare it on “jurisprudential life support.”  \nJ. Walker Op. 26.  If a precedent of the Supreme Court “has \ndirect application in a case”—as Humphrey’s Executor and \nWiener do here—“a lower court ‘should follow the case which \ndirectly  controls,’”  leaving  to  the  Supreme  Court  “‘the \nprerogative  of  overruling  its  own  decisions.’”  Mallory  v. \nNorfolk  S.  Ry.  Co.,  600  U.S.  122,  136  (2023)  (quoting \nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 \nU.S. 477, 484 (1989)).   \n \nImportantly, that rule governs “even if the lower court \nthinks the precedent is in tension with ‘some other line of \ndecisions.’”  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 (quoting Rodriguez de \nQuijas, 490 U.S. at 484); see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. \n203, 237 (1997) (“We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, \nthat other courts should conclude our more recent cases have, \nby  implication,  overruled  an  earlier  precedent.”);  National \nSecurity Archive v. CIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. \n2024) (“This Court is charged with following case law that \ndirectly controls a particular issue[.]”).2   \n \nYet “tension” is the most that the government and my \ncolleagues’  opinions  can  claim.    The  government  frankly \nadmits it.  At oral argument, the government, with admirable \n \n2 See also Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 54 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237); Sierra Club v. E.P.A., 322 F.3d \n718, 725 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Rodriquez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at \n484). \n \n\n104a\n22 \ncandor, acknowledged no less than four times that it believes \nthe constitutionality of removal protections for multimember \nbodies is not “clear.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 24:25; see id. at 10:24–11:5 \n(“[T]he Supreme Court has left the lower courts in something \nof a tough spot[.]”); 84:16–23 (There is, “at a minimum, a very \nsubstantial question” and “reasonable minds can differ” about \nthe  scope  of  Humphrey’s  Executor  today.);  88:17–18 \n(“[T]here’s some uncertainty” in the wake of Collins.).   \n \nJudge  Henderson  agrees  that  it  is  “unclear”  when  the \nHumphrey’s Executor rule for multimember boards applies, J. \nHenderson Op. 1, and that “reasonable minds can—and often \ndo—disagree”  about  how  to  apply  the  Supreme  Court’s \nprecedent, id. at 3.  \n \nThe reason for that lack of clarity is obvious:  The Supreme \nCourt  has  not  overruled  Humphrey’s  Executor  or  Wiener.  \nQuite the opposite, it has expressly carved out multimember \nindependent boards from its recent holdings on the removal \npower  and  has  expressly  left  Humphrey’s  Executor  “in \nplace[.]”    Seila  Law,  591  U.S.  at  215.    That  is  why  the \nconcurring opinion of Justices Thomas and Gorsuch in Seila \nLaw exists at all:  They write to say that they would have gone \nfurther than the Court and struck down Humphrey’s Executor.  \nId. at 238–239 (Thomas, J., joined by Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin part and dissenting in part).  So Judge Walker cannot cite a \nsingle Supreme Court case saying that the Court has effectively \noverruled Humphrey’s Executor or confined that opinion to its \nfacts, never to be applied again.  See J. Walker Op. 30.   \n \nJudge  Walker’s  opinion,  instead,  presumes  to  do  the \nSupreme Court’s job for it.  After omitting what the Supreme \nCourt  actually  said  about  Humphrey’s  Executor  in  Free \nEnterprise, Seila Law, and Collins, Judge Walker discerns a \nclarity that everyone  else has missed,  announcing that the \n \n\n105a\n23 \nSupreme Court has imposed “a binding command on the lower \ncourts”  not  to  extend  Humphrey’s  Executor  to  “any  new \ncontexts,” so that this court “cannot extend Humphrey’s—not \neven an inch.”  J. Walker Op. 30. \n \nThe problem?  The opinion never cites to Supreme Court \nlanguage for that “binding obligation,” nor does it quote or cite \nanything for the proposed requirement that any multimember \nboard must be an “identical twin” to the FTC to be sustained.   \n \nThat is because the Supreme Court has not said either thing.   \nRather than take the Supreme Court at its word, Judge Walker’s \nopinion  prognosticates  that  the  Supreme  Court  will  in  the \nfuture invalidate all removal protections for all multimember \nboards that exercise “any” executive power in any form.  J. \nWalker Op. 36.   \n \nBut that is the very job the Supreme Court has forbidden us \nto undertake.  We are to apply controlling precedent, not play \njurisprudential weather forecasters.  To do otherwise would be \nto accuse the Supreme Court of not meaning what it said when \nit  repeatedly  left  Humphrey’s  Executor  in  place,  and  of \nengaging  in  a  disingenuous  bait-and-switch  when  seven \nJustices openly invited Congress to repair the constitutional \nflaw in the CFPB by reconstituting it as a multimember body.  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 237 (Roberts, C.J., joined by Alito and \nKavanaugh, JJ., concurring in the judgment); id. at 298 (Kagan, \nJ., joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., concurring \nin the judgment with respect to severability and dissenting in \npart).  \n \nGetting out ahead of the Supreme Court that way is beyond \nmy pay grade.  When the Supreme Court makes and expressly \npreserves precedent, “we [should] take its assurances seriously.  \nIf the Justices [were] just pulling our leg, let them say so.”  \n \n\n106a\n24 \nSherman v. Community. Consol. Sch. Dist. 21 of Wheeling \nTownship, 980 F.2d 437, 448 (7th Cir. 1992) (Easterbrook, J.); \nsee also Illinois v. Ferriero, 60 F.4th 704, 718–719 (D.C. Cir. \n2023) (“[C]arefully considered language of the Supreme Court, \neven  if  technically  dictum,  generally  must  be  treated  as \nauthoritative.”) (citation omitted). \n \nStaying in our lane is even more vital in deciding a motion \nto stay.  A stay pending appeal, like a preliminary injunction, \nis meant to be a “stopgap measure[,]” made under “conditions \nof grave uncertainty” and with the awareness that it may prove \nto be “mistaken” once the merits are decided.  Singh v. Berger, \n56 F.4th 88, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted).  It is not an \nopportunity to effect a sea change in the law—especially one \nthat the Supreme Court itself has repeatedly forborne.   \n \nb \n \nAs if Supreme Court precedent was not enough to find that \nthe  government  is  not  likely  to  succeed  in  these  appeals, \nbinding circuit precedent doubles down on it.  Prior circuit \nopinions are “of course binding on us under the law-of-the-\ncircuit doctrine.”  Palmer v. FAA, 103 F.4th 798, 806 (D.C. Cir. \n2024); Campaign Legal Ctr. v. 45Committee, Inc., 118 F.4th \n378, 386 n.* (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“‘One three-judge panel’ of this \ncourt ‘does not have the authority to overrule another three-\njudge panel of the court. * * *  That power may be exercised \nonly by the full court,’ either through an en banc decision or a \nso-called Irons footnote.”) (quoting LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 \nF.3d 1389, 1395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc)). \n \nThis court has repeatedly applied Humphrey’s Executor as \nprecedent, including as recently as the last two years.  See Meta \nPlatforms, Inc. v. FTC, No. 24-5054, 2024 WL 1549732, at *2 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 29, 2024) (per curiam); Severino v. Biden, 71 \n \n\n107a\n25 \nF.4th 1038, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 2023); FEC v. NRA Political \nVictory Fund, 6 F.3d 821, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (noting that \ncases such as Humphrey’s Executor and Morrison confirmed \nthe  constitutionality  of  the  Federal  Election  Commission’s \nstructure).  Yet both Judge Walker’s and Judge Henderson’s \nopinions ignore that binding precedent. \n \nOther circuits too have faithfully hewed to the Supreme \nCourt’s admonition not to get out over their jurisprudential skis \nand  have  continued  to  apply  Humphrey’s  Executor.    See \nConsumers’ Research v. CPSC, 91 F.4th 342, 347, 352 (5th \nCir.  2024)  (Humphrey’s  Executor  is  “still-on-the-books \nprecedent” and “has not been overruled[.]”), cert. denied, 145 \nS. Ct. 414 (2024); Leachco, Inc. v. CPSC, 103 F.4th 748, 761–\n762 (10th Cir. 2024) (“[T]he Supreme Court in Seila Law \nclearly  stated  that  Humphrey’s  Executor  remains  binding \ntoday.”); Magnetsafety.org v. CPSC, No. 22-9578, 2025 WL \n665101, at *7 (10th Cir. Mar. 3, 2025) (“Humphrey’s Executor \nremains binding today.”) (quoting Leachco, 103 F.4th at 761).   \n \nIn sum, this court’s duty—especially at this early stay \nstage—is to follow binding and dispositive Supreme Court and \ncircuit precedent in evaluating the government’s likelihood of \nsuccess.  And the government has not shown any likelihood of \nprevailing under Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener, as well as \ncircuit precedent.  If the government thinks it has a likelihood \nof success on certiorari to the Supreme Court, it can raise that \nargument there.  This court has no business getting ahead of \nthat Court in these appeals.  And we certainly should not cast \noff Supreme Court precedent, depart from circuit precedent, \nand create a circuit conflict just to determine the government’s \neligibility for a stay that is meant only to maintain the status \nquo. \n \n \n \n\n108a\n26 \nE \n \nEven if Supreme Court precedent did not dictate the answer \nto the likelihood-of-success question, the government’s and my \ncolleagues’ efforts in their opinions to reduce Humphrey’s \nExecutor and Wiener to constitutional rubble are not likely to \nsucceed.   \n \n1 \n \nThis court’s starting point is to presume that the Civil \nService Reform Act and the National Labor Relations Act are \nconstitutional.  United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. 445, 463 n.6 \n(2019); Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality v. \nE.P.A., 790 F.3d 138, 182 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  And with or \nwithout  that  presumption,  the  statutory  removal  provisions \npass constitutional muster.   \n \nTo  start,  the  removal  restrictions  comport  with  the \nConstitution’s text.  Article I gives Congress the full authority \nto  create  agencies  and  the  officer  positions  to  run  those \nagencies.  U.S. CONST. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18 (“The Congress shall \nhave Power * * * To make all Laws which shall be necessary \nand proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, \nand  all  other  Powers  vested  by  this  Constitution  in  the \nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or \nOfficer thereof.”).  The Constitution also makes explicit that \nCongress, and not just the President, has a role in staffing the \nagencies and positions created by law.  Under Article II’s \nAppointments  Clause,  the  President  can  appoint  principal \nofficers only “by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate” and only as the legislature “shall * * * establish[] by \nLaw” those positions.  Art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  Congress also has \nplenary power to vest the appointment of inferior officers “in \nthe President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of \n \n\n109a\n27 \nDepartments.”  Id.  And, of course, it is Congress who pays, \nwith taxpayer dollars, for everyone employed in the Executive \nBranch.  Art. I, § 8, cl. 1.    \n \nArticle II, for its part, says nothing about removal power.  \nBut it does vest in the President “[t]he executive Power” and \ncharge the President with “tak[ing] Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed[.]”  U.S. CONST. Art. II, §§ 1, 3.  Read \ntogether,  the  Constitution  invests  both  the  President  and \nCongress with coordinate responsibilities to build an effective \nand efficient government that serves the Nation’s important \ninterests.   \n \nHistory confirms that Congress may, as part of its design \nand  staffing  decisions,  condition  the  President’s  removal \nauthority when necessary to accomplish vital national goals.  \nCongressional authority to enact for-cause removal restrictions \ntraces back to the time of the Constitution’s adoption.  When \nCongress reenacted the Northwest Ordinance, it transferred the \nConfederation Congress’s removal authority over territorial \nofficials to the President, An Act to provide for the Government \nof the Territory Northwest of the river Ohio, ch. 8, § 1, 1 Stat. \n50,  53  (Aug.  7,  1789),  but  left  intact  for-cause  removal \nprotections for territorial judges, id. at 51.3   \n \nThen,  in  1790,  Congress  created  the  Sinking  Fund \nCommission  (the  Federal  Reserve’s  early  predecessor)  to \nperform economically critical executive and policy functions.  \nCongress  directed  that  two  of  its  five  directors  would  be \nofficials whom the President could not remove.  An Act making \n \n3  Territorial  judges  do  not  constitutionally  enjoy  tenure \nprotection  because  they  are  not  Article  III  judges.    American \nInsurance Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S. 511, 546 (1828).  \n \n \n\n110a\n28 \nprovision for the reduction of the Public Debt, ch. 47, § 2, 1 \nStat. 186 (1790).  As for the First and Second Banks of the \nUnited States, Congress provided the President no removal \nauthority  over  members  of  the  First  Bank,  An  act  to \nincorporate the subscribers in the Bank of the United States, \nch. 10, § 4, 1 Stat. 191, 192–193 (1791), and gave the President \ncontrol  over  only  five  out  of  twenty-five  members  of  the \nSecond Bank, An Act to incorporate the subscribers to the \nBank of the United States, ch. 44, § 8, 3 Stat. 266, 269 (1816).4   \n \nNext, in 1855, Congress created the Court of Claims, the \njudges of which held office “during good behaviour,” An Act \nto establish a Court for the Investigation of Claims against the \nUnited States, ch. 22, § 1, 10 Stat. 612 (1855), even though they \nwere not Article III judges, see Williams v. United States, 289 \nU.S. 553, 563 (1933).   \n \nThe list goes on.  The statute creating the Comptroller of \nthe Currency required the President to gain Senate approval \nbefore removing the Comptroller, An Act to provide a national \nCurrency,  ch.  58,  § 1,  12  Stat.  665–666  (1863),  and  its \nsuccessor  statute,  while  vesting  removal  authority  in  the \nPresident, still required the President to “communicate[]” his \nreason “to the Senate” before exercising that authority, An Act \n \n4 Judge Walker’s opinion makes much of the Decision of 1789.  \nSee J. Walker Op. 9–10.  But the only thing decided in 1789 was that \nthe  President  need  not  always  consult  with  the  Senate  before \nremoving a principal officer, a proposition that no one contests today.  \nE.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 241 (1926) (Brandeis, J., \ndissenting).  Rather than focusing on short snippets from legislative \ndebates and law review articles, one can simply observe that the same \nCongress that apparently decided against removal restrictions also \ndecided to create removal restrictions, just not for every principal \nofficer. \n  \n \n\n111a\n29 \nto provide a National Currency, ch. 106, § 1, 13 Stat. 100 \n(1864). \n \nThen, in 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce \nCommission to regulate railroads.  Neither President Cleveland \nnor  a  single  member  of  Congress  raised  a  constitutional \nobjection  to  the  provision  allowing  the  removal  of \nCommissioners  only  “for  inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office[.]”  An act to regulate commerce, ch. \n104, § 11, 24 Stat. 383 (1887). \n \nFounding-era  Supreme  Court  precedent  documents  the \npractice as well.  In Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) \n137  (1803),  the  Supreme  Court,  through  Chief  Justice \nMarshall,  recognized  that  some  executive  officers  are  not \nremovable by the President:   \n \nWhere  an  officer  is  removable  at  the  will  of  the \nexecutive,  the  circumstance  which  completes  his \nappointment is of no concern; because the act is at any \ntime revocable; and the commission may be arrested, \nif still in the office.  But when the officer is not \nremovable  at  the  will  of  the  executive,  the \nappointment is not revocable, and cannot be annulled.  \nIt has conferred legal rights which cannot be resumed.   \n \nId.  at  162;  see  also  id.  at  172–173  (Marbury  “has  been \nappointed to an office, from which he is not removable, at the \nwill of the executive; and being so appointed, he has a right to \nthe commission which the secretary has received from the \npresident for his use.”).5   \n \n5 To be sure, the Supreme Court in dicta has dismissed this \ndiscussion in Marbury as “ill-considered dicta.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \n \n \n\n112a\n30 \n \nNone of this is surprising given the Constitution’s textual \nchecking and balancing, and general opposition to the over-\nconcentration of power in a single Branch.  As Justice Scalia \nsummarized when discussing the modern counterparts of these \nearly  agencies,  “removal  restrictions  have  been  generally \nregarded  as  lawful  for  so-called  ‘independent  regulatory \nagencies,’ such as the Federal Trade Commission, * * * the \nInterstate Commerce Commission, * * *, and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission * * *, which engage substantially \nin  what  has  been  called  the  ‘quasi-legislative  activity’  of \nrulemaking[.]”  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 724–725 (Scalia, J., \ndissenting).  Such “‘long settled and established practice is a \nconsideration of great  weight in a proper interpretation of \nconstitutional provisions’ regulating the relationship between \nCongress and the President.”  NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. \n513, 524 (2014) (quoting The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655, \n689 (1929)). \n \n \nat 227.  But it seems to me to be wisdom and knowledge gained from \nfirsthand experience at the time of the founding, and so cannot be \nbrushed away so easily.  John Marshall participated in the Virginia \nratification  debates  and  served  in  the  legislative  and  executive \nbranches  before  becoming  Chief  Justice.    See  Supreme  Court \nHistorical  Society,  Life  Story:    John  Marshall  (2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/JHA4-EPTH.  He was joined by Justice Paterson, a \ndelegate to the Constitutional Convention and a Senator in 1789, \nwhen the debate over removal took place.  See Supreme Court \nHistorical  Society,  William  Paterson  (2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/TL6M-7Y9M.  In searching for the Constitution’s \noriginal meaning, it is hard to understand the preference of Judge \nWalker’s  opinion  for  Myers—written  138  years  after  the \nConstitution’s  ratification—to  Marbury,  written  by  jurists  who \nhelped to write and to ratify the Constitution. \n \n\n113a\n31 \nThat is the historical grounding for the Supreme Court’s \ndecisions  in  Humphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener.  And  the \nMSPB’s and NLRB’s for-cause removal protections fit that \nhistorical practice.   \n \na \n \nStart with the MSPB.  In 1883, Congress created the Civil \nService  Commission—the  MSPB’s  predecessor  entity—to \naddress the serious problem of a federal workforce beset by \npolitical  patronage,  political  coercion,  and  instability.  \nPresidents and their subordinates could reward their supporters \nwith taxpayer-funded government jobs, but often had to fire \nthose already in office to make room for their favorites.  The \nresult was administrative dysfunction.  As one commentator \nput  it,  “[a]t  present  there  is  no  organization  save  that  of \ncorruption[;] * * * no system save that of chaos; no test of \nintegrity save that of partisanship; no test of qualification save \nthat of intrigue.”  Ari Hoogenboom, The Pendleton Act and the \nCivil Service, 64 AM. HIST. REV. 301, 301 (1959) (quoting \nJulius Bing, Our Civil Service, PUTNAM’S MAG. 232, 236 (Aug. \n1868)); see id. at 302 (“Contemporaries noted the cloud of fear \nthat  hovered  over  government  workers,  especially  after  a \nchange of administration.  It was impossible for an esprit de \ncorps  or  for  loyalty  to  office  or  agency  to  develop  in  an \natmosphere of nervous tension. * * *  A civil servant was loyal \nprimarily to his patron—the local political who procured him \nhis job.”).   \n \nConcerns about this patronage system were a longstanding \nconcern.  As Mark Twain observed:  “Unless you can get the \near of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of a Bureau or \nDepartment, and persuade him to use his ‘influence’ in your \nbehalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature \nin Washington.  Mere merit, fitness and capability[] are useless \n \n\n114a\n32 \nbaggage  to  you  without  ‘influence.’”    MARK  TWAIN  & \nCHARLES WARNER, THE GILDED AGE 223 (1873); see also \nMark Twain, Special Dispatch, N.Y. Times (Oct. 2, 1876) (“We \nhope and expect to sever [the civil] service as utterly from \npolitics as is the naval and military service, and we hope to \nmake it as respectable, too.  We hope to make worth and \ncapacity the sole requirements of the civil service[.]”). \n \nGovernmental malfunction was so disabling that President \nGarfield devoted a portion of his 1881 inaugural address to the \nproblem.    He  emphasized  the  need  for  tenure  protections, \nexplaining that the civil service could “never be placed on a \nsatisfactory basis until it is regulated by law[s]” that “prescribe \nthe grounds upon which removals shall be made during the \nterms for which incumbents have been appointed.”  President \nJames  A.  Garfield,  Inaugural  Address  (March  4,  1881), \nhttps://perma.cc/B5DM-T738.    President  Garfield’s \nassassination a few months later by a disappointed job seeker \ntransformed  concerns  about  the  patronage  system  into  a \nnational crisis.  Alan Gephardt, The Federal Civil Service and \nthe  Death  of  President  James  A.  Garfield,  National  Park \nService (2012), https://perma.cc/3QY2-LEUT. \n \nTwo years later, “strong discontent with the corruption and \ninefficiency of the patronage system of public employment \neventuated in the Pendleton Act, [ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403 (1883)].”  \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 354 (1976).  That Act created a \nCivil Service Commission to eliminate the “patronage system” \nof governance and create a professional civil service dedicated \nonly to working for the American people.  Id.  In that way, \n“Congress, the Executive, and the country” all agreed “that \npartisan  political  activities  by  federal  employees  must  be \nlimited if the Government is to operate effectively and fairly[.]”  \nUnited States Civil Service Comm’n v. National Association of \nLetter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 413 U.S. 548, 564 (1973).   \n \n\n115a\n33 \n \nThe  MSPB’s  raison  d’etre  is  to  effectuate  this \ngovernmental commitment to prioritizing merit over partisan \nloyalty.  Housing all employment matters in the Civil Service \nCommission had proven unworkable as the Commission had \naccumulated “conflicting responsibilities” in its roles as “a \nmanager, rulemaker, prosecutor and judge.”  President Jimmy \nCarter,  Fed.  Civ.  Serv.  Reform  Msg.  to  Cong.  (March  2, \n1978), https://perma.cc/2URA-FJRR.  Its  slow  pace  of \ndecision-making had also confounded efforts to enforce civil \nservice laws for both employees and employing agencies.  See \nUnited States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 458 (1988) (Stevens, J., \ndissenting).   \n \nTo address the problem, the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act \ncreated  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  to  perform \n“personnel administration[,]” the Office of Special Counsel to \n“investigate  and  prosecute[,]”  and  the  MSPB  to  “be  the \nadjudicatory arm of the new personnel system.”  President \nCarter, Fed. Civ. Serv. Reform Msg.; see Civil Service Reform \nAct of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 3, 92 Stat. 1111, 1112 (The \nAct  will  provide  “the  people  of  the  United  States  with  a \ncompetent, honest, and productive Federal work force” that is \ngoverned by “merit system principles and free from prohibited \npersonnel practices[.]”). \n \nThe  Reform  Act  provided  MSPB  members  with  some \nremoval protection to ensure both employees and agencies that \ndecisions would be made based on the facts and law, rather than \npolitical allegiance or fear of retribution.  The MSPB also hears \nclaims by whistleblowers exposing waste, fraud, and abuse \nwithin  federal  agencies.    Removal  protections  offer \nwhistleblowers  assurance  that  their  claims  will  be  heard \nimpartially  and  objectively,  free  from  retributive  political \npressure.  For “it is quite evident that one who holds his office \n \n\n116a\n34 \nonly during the pleasure of another cannot be depended upon \nto maintain an attitude of independence against the latter’s \nwill.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.   \n \nSaid  another  way,  if  the  Constitution  requires  that \nPresidents be allowed to fire members of the Merit Systems \nProtection Board for any partisan, policy, or personal reason, \nthen Congress and the taxpayers cannot have a professional \ncivil service based on merit.  Nor could the MSPB provide the \n“requirement of neutrality in adjudicative proceedings” that \n“safeguards  the  * * *  central  concerns  of  procedural  due \nprocess[.]”  Marshall v. Jericco, 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980); see \nSchweiker  v.  McClure,  456  U.S.  188,  195  (1982)  (“[D]ue \nprocess demands impartiality on the part of those who function \nin judicial or quasi-judicial capacities.”).   \n \nAt the same time, by housing the adjudicatory authority in \na multimember board, the Political Branches prevented the \naccumulation of power in the hands of a single individual \nanswerable to no one.  Cf. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 222–226; \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 \n(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (“[T]he Constitution diffuses \npower the better to secure liberty[.]”).  The group decision-\nmaking dynamic of the collective Board also helps to ensure \nthat members can and will ground their decisions in the law and \nfacts  alone,  which  they  have  to  justify  in  their  judicially \nreviewable written decisions.  That is, they have to show their \nwork.    The  requirement  of  a  politically  balanced  Board \ndemonstrates the Political Branches’ bipartisan commitment to \ncreating a neutral and unbiased adjudicatory process.  That \ncontrasts sharply with the single heads of agencies in Seila Law \nand Collins, who were accountable to no one and did not need \nto be appointed in a politically neutral manner.   \n \n \n\n117a\n35 \nPresumably that balance is why, over the last 50 years and \neight  presidential  administrations,  there  has  been  nary  a \nconstitutional objection in a presidential signing statement or \nOffice  of  Legal  Counsel  opinion  to  the  MSPB’s  removal \nrestrictions.  Quite the opposite.  Shortly before passage of the \nReform Act, the Office of Legal Counsel agreed that the MSPB \nwas “a quasi-judicial body whose officials may be legitimately \nexempted  from  removal  at  the  pleasure  of  the  President.”  \nPresidential Appointees—Removal Power—Civil Serv. Reform \nAct-Const. L. (Article II, S 2, Cl. 2), 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 121 \n(1978).6  \n \n6 The government’s briefs and Judge Henderson’s and Judge \nWalker’s opinions cite nothing at all.  The most I have found is that \nPresidents George H. Bush and Clinton noted different potential \nconstitutional problems related to the MSPB with the Whistleblower \nProtection Act of 1989 and MSPB Reauthorization Act of 1994, \nrespectively, but those had nothing to do with constitutional concerns \nabout  removal  protections  for  MSPB  members.

DOC. 516 (Apr. 10, 1989); Presidential \nStatement on Signing Legislation Reauthorizing the Merit Systems \nProtection Board and the Office of Special Counsel, 30 WEEKLY \nCOMP.  PRES.  DOC.  2202  (Oct.  29,  1994).    Moreover,  to  my \nknowledge, neither OLC nor any President in a signing statement has \ncalled into doubt Humphrey’s Executor or Wiener or suggested that \nthose opinions have lost their validity.  This stands in sharp contrast \nto removal restrictions on the four modern single-head agencies \nwhose constitutionality was questioned from the outset.  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 221 (The Office of Special Counsel was the “first \nenduring single-leader office, created nearly 200 years after the \nConstitution  was  ratified,  [and]  drew  a  contemporaneous \nconstitutional objection from the Office of Legal Counsel under \nPresident Carter and a subsequent veto on constitutional grounds by \nPresident  Reagan.”);  Collins,  594  U.S.  at  251  (These  agencies \n \n \n\n118a\n36 \n \nb \n \nThe critical national need for an impartial, multimember \nadjudicatory process applies with at least equal force to the \nNLRB.  Before its creation, the United States was racked by \nviolent  labor  strikes  and  brutal  repression  of  the  strikers.  \nBetween 1877 and 1934, there were thousands of violent labor \ndisputes, many of which required state and federal troops to \ncontrol.    See  Philip  Taft  &  Philip  Ross,  American  Labor \nViolence:  Its Causes, Character, and Outcome, in VIOLENCE \nIN AMERICA:  HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES:  \nA STAFF REPORT TO THE NATIONAL COMM’N. ON THE CAUSES \nAND PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE 225–272 (Hugh Graham & Ted \nGurr eds.  1969) (“National Report on Labor Violence”).  In \n1934 alone, the National Guard had to be mobilized to quell \nstrikes in Minnesota, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South \nCarolina and California.  Id. at 269–272.  In addition to the \nhuman toll of the many killed and wounded, the economic costs \nwere staggering: “the vacating of 1,745,000 jobs,” the “loss of \n50,242,000 working days every 12 months,” and a cost to the \neconomy of “at least $1,000,000,000 per year” in 1934 dollars, \nwhich would be approximately $23.5 billion per year now.  S. \nREP. NO. 74-573, at 2 (1935); see National Labor Relations \nAct, Pub. L. No. 74-198, 49 Stat. 449 (1935) (“The denial by \nsome  employers  of  the  right  of  employees  to  organize \n* * * lead[s] to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or \nunrest, which have * * * the necessary effect of burdening or \nobstructing commerce[.]”). \n \n \n“lack[] a foundation in historical practice[.]”) (quoting Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 204). \n \n \n\n119a\n37 \nThe inability to facilitate peaceful negotiations between \nemployers and labor was “one of the most prolific causes of \nstrife” and, according to the Supreme Court, was such “an \noutstanding fact in the history of labor disturbances that it [wa]s \na proper subject of judicial notice and require[d] no citation of \ninstances.”  NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. \n1, 42 (1937).   \n \nImportantly, federal and state courts had proven unable to \nresolve these conflicts.  See FELIX FRANKFURTER & NATHAN \nGREENE, THE LABOR INJUNCTION (1930); HOWARD GILLMAN, \nTHE CONSTITUTION BESIEGED 61–100 (1995).  That is why \nCongress created the NLRB—an expert agency capable of \nfacilitating  “negotiation”  and  “promot[ing]  [the]  industrial \npeace[.]”  Jones & Laughlin, 301 U.S. at 45.  “Everyday \nexperience  in  the  administration  of  the  [National  Labor \nRelations  Act]  gives  [the  NLRB]  familiarity  with  the \ncircumstances and backgrounds of employment relationships \nin various industries, with the abilities and needs of the workers \nfor  self  organization  and  collective  action,  and  with  the \nadaptability of collective bargaining for the peaceful settlement \nof  their  disputes  with  their  employers.”    NLRB  v.  Hearst \nPublications, 322 U.S. 111, 130 (1944).   \n \nAs with the MSPB, the Political Branches concluded that \nthe neutrality of Board members would be indispensable to \ntheir vital role, so they had to be kept free from both the \nperception and the reality of direct political influence that an \nunalloyed removal power would permit.  With “the Damocles’ \nsword of removal by the President” hanging over the NLRB, \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 356, employers and labor would lose faith \nthat the NRLB is impartially administering the law rather than \ntacking to ever-changing political winds.  \n \n \n\n120a\n38 \nIn addition, an unchecked removal power would cause \nfrequent and sharp changes in how the NLRB adjudicates \ncases.  That lack of stability in the law would make it harder \nfor businesses and labor to enter into agreements to resolve \nlabor disputes.  One party might prefer to wait for the next \nelection  before  committing  to  a  collective  bargaining \nagreement.  Or those agreements could be shortened to mirror \nthe terms of politically replaceable Board members.  Both \nwould spawn more breakdowns in labor relations, strikes, and \neconomic  disruption.    See  International  Organization  of \nMasters, Mates & Pilots, ILA, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 61 F.4th 169, \n180 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (discussing the importance of consistent \npolicymaking to protect and encourage reliance interests).  \n  \nNinety years after the NLRA, it may be hard to imagine the \nexceptional disruption to the national economy caused by the \nabsence of an impartial and expert administrative forum for the \nresolution of labor disputes.  But that is because the NLRB has \nworked.  National Report on Labor Violence at 292 (“The \nsharp decline in the level of industrial violence is one of the \ngreat achievements of the National Labor Relations Board.”).  \nAnd it is the indispensability of a neutral adjudicator between \nlabor and employers that explains why the Supreme Court has \nsaid  directly  that  the  NLRB  does  not  “offend  against  the \nconstitutional requirements governing the creation and action \nof administrative bodies.”  Jones & Laughlin, 301 U.S. at 46–\n47. \n \n2 \n \nIn  response  to  the  Political  Branches’  joint  and \nlongstanding  conclusions  as  to  the  critical  necessity  for  a \nprofessional civil service and a neutral adjudicatory forum to \nobtain  industrial  peace  in  the  national  economy,  the \ngovernment and Judge Walker’s opinion blow a one-note horn:  \n \n\n121a\n39 \naccountability.  J. Walker Op. 1, 7, 21–22; Gov’t Stay Mot. in \nHarris 10, 13; Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 9, 12.  \n \nBut  accountability  remains.    Harris  and  Wilcox  were \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  S. \nRoll Call Vote No. 209, 117th Cong., 2d Sess. (2022) (Harris); \nS. Roll Call Vote No. 216, 118th Cong., 1st Sess. (2023) \n(Wilcox).  They must leave office when their terms of seven \nand five years respectively end.  5 U.S.C. § 1202(a) (Harris); \n29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (Wilcox).  In the interim, the President can \nremove them for cause if they fail to “faithfully execute[]” the \nlaw, as well as for basic incompetence.  U.S. CONST. Art. II, \n§ 3;  see  5  U.S.C.  § 1202(d)  (Harris);  29  U.S.C.  § 153(a) \n(Wilcox).  This alone gives the President “ample authority” to \nensure  they  are  “competently  performing  [their]  statutory \nresponsibilities[.]”  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 692; see also Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 509 (With “a single level of good-\ncause tenure” between the President and the Board, “[t]he \nCommission is then fully responsible for the Board’s actions, \nwhich are no less subject than the Commission’s own functions \nto Presidential oversight.”).  On top of this, Congress can \neliminate  their  offices  completely.    U.S.  CONST.  Art.  I, \n§ 8.  The public can comment on their policies.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(c).  And they must regularly send reports to the President \nand  Congress.    Id.  § 1206  (Harris);  29  U.S.C.  § 153(c) \n(Wilcox).  Just because a President cannot fire Harris and \nWilcox for no reason or because he does not like their rulings \ndoes not mean that they wield unchecked and unaccountable \nauthority. \n \nBeyond that, the suggestion in Judge Walker’s opinion that \nelectoral accountability is the Constitution’s lodestar for the \nexecutive branch is misplaced.  See J. Walker Op. 48 (“The \npeople elected the President, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute \nthe nation’s laws.”) (emphases added).  But there are other \n \n\n122a\n40 \nvalues at stake—stability, competence, experience, efficiency, \nenergy, and prudence, for example.  Anyhow, the members of \nCongress  who  created  the  MSPB  and  NLRB  are  directly \nelected by the people who are affected by the competence and \nstability of the federal civil service and labor disruptions.  By \ncontrast, Americans do not directly elect the President.  Instead, \nthey vote for delegates to the electoral college who cast votes \nfor  the  President.    See  U.S.  CONST.  Amend.  XII.    This \nprocedure  was  not  designed  to  maximize  popular \naccountability.    See  THE  FEDERALIST  NO.  68  (Alexander \nHamilton)  (“It  was  equally  desirable,  that  the  immediate \nelection should be made by men most capable of analyzing the \nqualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances \nfavorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all \nthe reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their \nchoice.  A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-\ncitizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess \nthe information and discernment requisite to such complicated \ninvestigations.”).  To the extent that Judge Walker’s opinion’s \ndescription of the presidency appears familiar, it is because it \ndescribes the presidency circa 2025, not circa 1788 when the \nConstitution was adopted and the roles of Congress and the \nPresident in designing the government were formulated. \n \n* * * * * \n \nIn  short,  this  Nation’s  historical  practice  of  removal \nrestrictions on multimember boards combined with the acute \nneed for impartial adjudicatory bodies to give effect to civil \nservice protections and to provide labor peace and stability \ntogether demonstrate the constitutional permissibility of the \nremoval limitations for members of these two adjudicatory \nbodies.  Such a “systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long \npursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before \nquestioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to \n \n\n123a\n41 \nuphold the Constitution, making as it were such exercise of \npower part of the structure of our government, may be treated \nas a gloss on ‘executive Power’ vested in the President by § 1 \nof Art. II.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U.S. at 610–\n611 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).   \n \nFor  all  those  reasons,  at  this  procedural  juncture,  the \ngovernment  is  not  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  its \nargument that the removal provisions are unconstitutional even \nif binding Supreme Court and circuit precedent did not already \nresolve the likelihood of success question in favor of Harris and \nWilcox. \n \nF \n \nThe government additionally has failed to demonstrate a \nlikelihood of success on its argument that this court cannot \nremedy Harris’s and Wilcox’s injuries.  “The very essence of \ncivil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to \nclaim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an \ninjury.”  Marbury, 5 U.S. at 163.  And it is “indisputable” that \nthe wrongful removal from office constitutes “a cognizable \ninjury[.]”  Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042; see Sampson v. Murray, \n415 U.S. 61, 91 (1974); Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356 (permitting \nsuit for damages).  Indeed, the government acknowledges that \nHarris and Wilcox have remediable injuries.  Gov’t. Stay Mot. \nin Harris 18; Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Wilcox 19.   \n \nFour remedies are available in this context, should the \ndistrict court judgments in favor of Harris and Wilcox be \nsustained on appeal. \n \nFirst, there is no dispute that Harris and Wilcox could \nobtain backpay due to an unlawful firing if their wages have \nbeen disrupted.  See, e.g., Myers, 272 U.S. at 106. \n \n\n124a\n42 \n \nSecond, federal courts may preserve in office or reinstate \nsomeone fired from the Executive Branch with an injunction if \nthe circumstances are “extraordinary.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at \n92 n.68; see Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 388 (1957).  The \nplaintiff must demonstrate “irreparable injury sufficient in kind \nand  degree  to  override”  the  “disruptive  effect”  to  “the \nadministrative process[.]”  Sampson, 354 U.S. at 83–84; see id. \nat 92 n.68.   \n \nThis  rule  extends  to  officers  who  hold  positions  on \nmultimember  boards.    Even  though  an  injunction  cannot \nrestore  such  officeholders  to  office  de  jure,  this  court’s \nprecedent holds that a court can order their restoration to office \nde facto.  In Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973 (D.C. Cir. 1996), \nPresident Clinton removed Robert Swan from the board of the \nNational Credit Union Administration, id. at 974.  This court \nheld that it could grant Swan relief by enjoining the board and \nall  other  relevant  executive  officials  subordinate  to  the \nPresident to treat Swan as a legitimate board member.  Id. at \n980.  Similarly, in Severino v. Biden, this court concluded that \nit could issue an injunction to “reinstate a wrongly terminated \nofficial  ‘de  facto,’  even  without  a  formal  presidential \nreappointment.”  71 F.4th at 1042–1043 (quoting Swan, 100 \nF.3d at 980). \n \nAt this juncture, the government has failed to show that, \nshould  the  judgments  in  favor  of  Harris  and  Wilcox  be \nsustained on appeal, there would be an insufficient basis for the \ninjunctions that retained them in office.  Harris’s and Wilcox’s \nremovals  would  disrupt  the  routine  administration  of  the \nExecutive Branch by (1) depriving the adjudicatory bodies on \nwhich they sit of quora to function, and (2) denying the parties’ \nwhose cases Congress has channeled to the MSPB and NLRB \nthe very impartiality and expertise in decision-making that \n \n\n125a\n43 \nprotections against removal provide.  A merits panel could find \nthat to be a severe injury to the public. \n \nThe government invokes older caselaw holding that an \ninjunction  cannot  restore  someone  to  their  position  in  the \nExecutive Branch.  See Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 19–20 (citing \nIn re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888), and White v. Berry, \n171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898)).  But, as the Supreme Court itself \nhas said:  “Much water has flowed over the dam since 1898,” \nand it is now well established that “federal courts do have \nauthority to review the claim of a discharged governmental \nemployee.”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 71. \n \nThe government argues that we cannot enjoin the President.  \nGov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 18.  That argument is beside the point \nbecause Harris and Wilcox never asked the district court to \nenjoin the President.  The district courts enjoined subordinate \nexecutive officers, not the President, consistent with circuit \nprecedent in Swan that binds this panel.  Harris, 2025 WL \n679303,  at  *16;  Wilcox,  2025  WL  720914  at  *16,  18.  \nInjunctions against subordinate executive officials to prevent \nillegal action by the Executive Branch are well known to the \nlaw.  See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U.S. at 584; \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 567 (2006); Swan, 100 \nF.3d at 980.  Nor do such injunctions “necessarily target[] the \nPresident[.]”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL \n559669,  at  *13  n.2  (D.C.  Cir. Feb.  15,  2025)  (Katsas,  J., \ndissenting).  The injunctions put the President under no legal \nobligation  to  recognize  Harris  and  Wilcox  as  legitimate \nofficeholders.    The  injunctions  instead  require  other \ngovernment officials to treat them as de facto office holders for \nthe rest of their terms.  \n \nThe government reads Swan and Severino as limited to \ndisputes about standing.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 20.  That \n \n\n126a\n44 \nmakes no sense.  Standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite to \nbringing suit in federal court.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998).  To establish standing, \nplaintiffs must show, among other things, that their “injury \nwould likely be redressed by judicial relief.”  TransUnion LLC \nv. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021); see Lujan v. Defenders \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 568–571 (1992); Steel Co., 523 U.S. \nat 107.  So recognizing the existence of a legal remedy is a \ncritical  precondition  to  resolving  a  lawsuit  on  the  merits.  \nBecause jurisdiction in both Swan and Severino depended on \nholding that an injunction could issue, and both cases held that \nthere was jurisdiction and went on to decide the merits, both \ncases necessarily held that an injunction could restore someone \nto office de facto.  \n \nThird, the government did not dispute in district court that \nWilcox could obtain a declaratory judgment, so it has forfeited \nany argument as to the unavailability of that form of relief in \nher case.  Wilcox, 2025 WL 720914, at *16.   \n \nThe government does argue that Harris is ineligible for \ndeclaratory relief.  Gov’t Stay Mot. in Harris 21.  That is \nincorrect.    Declaratory  relief  is  governed  by  “the  same \nequitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction.”  \nSamuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 73 (1971).  For the same \nreasons that injunctions could be warranted in these cases, so \ntoo could declaratory judgments.  And a declaratory judgment \nmay issue against the President.  Clinton v. City of New York, \n524 U.S. 417, 428 (1998); National Treasury Employees, 492 \nF.2d at 616.   \n \nFourth, a writ of mandamus is another available form of \nrelief  for  Harris  and  Wilcox.    A  writ  of  mandamus  is  a \ntraditional remedy at law ordering an executive official to carry \nout a mandatory and legally ministerial duty, Swan, 100 F.3d \n \n\n127a\n45 \nat 977, which includes redressing an unlawful removal from \npublic office, In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212; White, 171 U.S. at \n377.   \n \nThe use of mandamus to assert title to an office was well \nknown at the founding.  See, e.g., R. v. Blooer (1760) 97 Eng. \nRep. 697, 698 (KB) (Mansfield, C.J.) (“A mandamus to restore \nis  the  true  specific  remedy  where  a  person  is  wrongfully \ndispossessed  of  any  office  or  function[.]”);  3  WILLIAM \nBLACKSTONE,  COMMENTARIES  ON  THE  LAWS  OF  ENGLAND \n*264 (1765) (“The writ of mandamus” is “a most full and \neffectual remedy” for “wrongful removal, when a person is \nlegally possessed” of an office.); R. v. The Mayor, Aldermen, \nand Common Council, of London, (1787) 100 Eng. Rep. 96, \n97–98 (KB) (Ashhurst, J.) (agreeing with counsel’s argument \nthat “[w]henever a person is improperly suspended or removed \nfrom an office * * * the Court will grant a mandamus to restore \nhim”); R. v. The Mayor and Alderman of Doncaster (1752) 96 \nEng. Rep. 795, 795 (KB) (restoring an alderman to office with \na writ of mandamus).  Indeed, Marbury—who, like Harris and \nWilcox, was nominated by the President, and confirmed by the \nSenate, Journal of the Executive Proceedings of the Senate, \nvol.  1,  at  338,  390  (1801)—sought  mandamus  to  compel \ndelivery of his commission to serve as a justice of the peace in \nWashington D.C, see Marbury, 5 U.S. at 155.   \n \nIf no injunctive relief were available, mandamus could \nissue in these cases because the President violated a non-\ndiscretionary  statutory  duty  by  firing  Harris  and  Wilcox \nwithout  relevant  justification,  in  direct  violation  of  the \ngoverning  laws’  plain  language.    See  5  U.S.C.  § 1202(d) \n(MSPB members “may be removed by the President only for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”); 29 \nU.S.C.  § 153(a)  (The  President  can  remove  NLRB  board \nmembers only with advance notice and “for neglect of duty or \n \n\n128a\n46 \nmalfeasance  in  office”).    Although  the  President  certainly \nenjoys broad discretion when making a finding of inefficiency, \nneglect, or malfeasance, the duty to justify removal on one of \nthose grounds is non-discretionary under both statutes.   \n \nThe government argues that the President is not amenable \nto mandamus.  Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Harris 22.  While issuance \nof  mandamus  against  the  President  would  be  a  last-resort \nremedy to enforce the rule of law, binding circuit precedent \nsays that “[m]andamus is not precluded because the federal \nofficial at issue is the President of the United States.”  National \nWildlife Federation v. United States, 626 F.2d 917, 923 (D.C. \nCir. 1980); see National Treasury Employees Union v. Nixon, \n492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974).   \n \nThe government relies on Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. \n475 (1866), but that case expressly “left open” the question \nwhether mandamus can issue against the President.  Franklin \nv. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801–802 (1992); see Swan, \n100  F.3d  at  977.    That  is  because  Johnson  involved  the \nPresident’s discretionary judgment under the Reconstruction \nActs to use military force to govern the former confederate \nstates.  71 U.S. at 499.  So that decision does not speak to circuit \nprecedent  holding  that  mandamus  is  available  for  non-\ndiscretionary ministerial duties.   \n \nFor  all  those  reasons,  the  government  is  not  likely  to \nsucceed in its argument that no remedy can be given to Harris \nand Wilcox, should the decisions in their favor be sustained on \nappeal. \n \nIV \n \nThe remaining stay factors concern injury to the parties and \nthe public interest.  That balance implicates multiple competing \n \n\n129a\n47 \ninterests here because the government seeks to have provisions \nof duly enacted federal statutes declared unconstitutional and \nto prevent agencies  created and funded by Congress from \nfunctioning during (at least) the pendency of these appeals, if \nnot longer. \n \nAs the party seeking a stay, the government bears the \nburden of demonstrating that it will suffer an irreparable injury \nduring the time these cases are pending before this court.  Nken, \n556 U.S. at 433–434.  The government has disclaimed any \nargument  that  Harris  and  Wilson  are  incompetent  or \nmalfeasant.  Instead, the sole irreparable injury asserted is that \nthe President’s asserted constitutional right to terminate Harris \nand Wilcox will be infringed.  See Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Harris \n22; Gov’t. Stay Mot. in Wilcox 22.  That falls short of an \nirreparable injury for three reasons. \n \nFirst, the asserted injury to the President is entirely bound \nup  with  the  merits  of  the  government’s  constitutional \nargument.  And controlling Supreme Court precedent says \nthere is no such constitutional injury.  The Supreme Court in \nWiener said specifically that “no such power” to remove a \npredominantly  adjudicatory  board  official  “is  given  to  the \nPresident directly by the Constitution[.]”  357 U.S. at 356; see \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.  This court is in no \nposition to recognize an injury that the Supreme Court has \ntwice unanimously disclaimed.  See Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237.  \nSo the same lack of clarity that Judge Henderson’s opinion sees \nin the merits, J. Henderson Op. 1–3, means that the asserted \ninjury of not being able to remove Harris and Wilcox is equally \nuncertain to exist. \n \nSecond, the government itself has not manifested in this \nlitigation the type of imminent or daily injury now claimed by \nthe government and Judge Walker’s opinion.  Gov’t Stay Mot. \n \n\n130a\n48 \nin Harris 22–23; Gov’t Stay Mot. in Wilcox 22–24; J. Walker \nOp. 43–45.  Harris’s and Wilcox’s cases have been pending for \nalmost two months.  In Harris’s case, the government agreed to \nhave the district court proceed to briefing and decision on \nsummary judgment on an expedited basis while a temporary \nrestraining order was in place.  Joint Status Report for Harris, \nECF No. 13 at 1.  In Wilcox’s case, the government proposed \nlengthening the briefing schedule, requesting that its brief be \ndue on March 10th, rather than Wilcox’s proposed February \n18th.  Joint Response Regarding Briefing Schedule for Wilcox, \nECF No. 12 at 2.  The government has not explained why it \ncould not similarly afford this court the time necessary to \ndecide a highly expedited appeal.   \n \nThird,  the  notion  that  the  presidency  is  irreparably \nweakened by not terminating Harris and Wilcox while this \nlitigation is pending ignores that eight Presidents (including \nthis  President)  have  faced  similar  constraints  in  removing \nMSPB members for decades, and fifteen Presidents could not \nremove NLRB members without cause.  Yet the government \npoints to no concrete manifestation of the harm it asserts, or \neven a public complaint from any preceding President.  Plus, if \nthe government prevails on appeal, any decisions resulting \nfrom Harris’s and Wilcox’s presence on their Boards would \nhave to be “completely undone” if a party requested it.  Collins, \n594 U.S. at 259–260.  So any harm in terms of decisions made \nis repairable. \n \nBy contrast, the entry of a stay in these cases materially \nalters the status quo in an unprecedentedly injurious manner to \nthe public as well as to Harris and Wilcox.  The point of a stay \nis to preserve the status quo pending litigation.  Nken, 556 U.S. \nat 429; Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 \nU.S. 1312, 1312 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers).  And this \ncourt’s precedent defines the relevant status quo as “the last \n \n\n131a\n49 \nuncontested status which preceded the pending controversy[,]” \nwhich is Harris and Wilcox in office.  Huisha-Huisha, 27 F.4th \nat  733  (citation  omitted).    So  does  the  Supreme  Court:  \n“Although such a stay acts to ‘ba[r] Executive Branch officials \nfrom removing [the applicant,] * * * it does so by returning to \nthe status quo—the state of affairs before the removal order \nwas entered.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 429 (citation omitted); cf. \nLackey v. Stinnie, 145 S. Ct. 659, 662 (2025) (“The purpose of \na preliminary injunction is merely to preserve  the relative \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.”). \n \nYet the stay sought by the government and entered by the \ncourt today turns the status quo for the last 46 and 89 years \nupside down.  By virtue of a preliminary and expeditiously \nconsidered  order,  this  court  has,  for  the  first  time  in  the \nNation’s history, allowed the termination of an MSPB member \nand  an  NLRB  member  in  violation  of  express  statutory \nconditions, 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d) (MSPB); 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) \n(NLRB), and on-point Supreme Court and circuit precedent. \n \nIn addition, this court, without any adjudication of the \nmerits, has afforded the government relief that will disable the \nMSPB and NLRB from operating by depriving both boards of \na quorum.  5 C.F.R. § 1200.3 (MSPB); 29 U.S.C. § 153(b) \n(NLRB).  Far from “staying” anything, the court’s order acts to \nkneecap  two  federal  agencies  and  prevent  them  from \nperforming the work assigned them by federal law and funded \nby Congress.   \n \nBecause federal law expressly channels federal employee \nand labor disputes to these agencies, the stay will lead to an \nimmediate backlog of cases.  When the MSPB was deprived of \na quorum between 2017 and 2022, a backlog of 3,793 cases \nbuilt up.  MSPB, Lack of Quorum and the Inherited Inventory:  \n \n\n132a\n50 \nChart of Cases Decided and Cases Pending at 2 (Feb. 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/Q58S-PLVV.   \n \nThe NLRB likewise cannot decide cases without a quorum.  \nSee 29 U.S.C. § 153(b); New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, 560 \nU.S. 674, 676 (2010).  Although the NLRB can delegate some \nof  its  responsibilities,  29  C.F.R.  §§ 102.178–182;  Order \nContingently Delegating Authority to the General Counsel, 76 \nFed.  Reg.  69,768  (Nov.  9,  2011),  it  cannot  delegate  the \nauthority  to  decide  cases.    Hundreds  of  cases  are  already \npending before the NLRB.  NLRB, Administrative Law Judge \nDecisions (Mar. 18, 2025), https://perma.cc/Z5S2-4UEP.   \n \nIf these Boards are deprived of quora, both employers and \nworkers  will  be  trapped  with  no  other  place to  take  their \ndisputes  for  resolution.    Federal  courts  cannot  hear  labor \ndisputes in the first instance because prior review by the NLRB \nis a jurisdictional prerequisite for judicial review.  29 U.S.C. \n§ 160(f); Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 476–477 \n(1964).  Nor can the parties resort to state court because the \nNational Labor Relations Act preempts state procedures.  San \nDiego Building Trades Council, Millmen’s Union, Loc. 2020 v. \nGarmon, 359 U.S. 236, 245 (1959) (“[T]he States as well as \nthe federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of \nthe National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state \ninterference with national policy is to be averted.”).  Paralyzing \nthe peaceful resolution of labor disputes threatens the vital \npublic  interests  in  avoiding  labor  strife  and  the  severe \neconomic consequences it causes.   \n \nThere is also a risk that these boards will be disabled for a \nmuch longer period of time.  Nothing obligates the President to \nappoint replacement members.  So by granting a stay, the \nmajority opinion converts the President’s removal authority \ninto the power to render inoperable, potentially for years on \n \n\n133a\n51 \nend, boards that Congress established and funded to address \ncritical national problems.  And that single-handed power to \nshutter agencies would render vital federal legislation a futility. \n \nIn  short,  whatever  the  scope  of  the  non-textual \nconstitutional removal power, it cannot license the Executive \nto destroy the ability of Congress to solve critical national \nproblems and to provide Americans with neutral and impartial \ndecision-making  processes  when  their  economic  lives, \nproperty, and wellbeing are affected.  The authority of two \nBranches is equally at stake.  That is why historical practice has \ntreated  the  statutory  adoption  of  removal  limitations  for \nmultimember boards and adjudicatory bodies as a matter for \nCongress and Presidents to work out together through the \nenactment and presentment process.   \n \nThese are just the consequences for the two agencies before \nthis court.  But given the test proposed by Judge Walker’s \nopinion foreclosing the exercise of “any” executive power or \ndeviating in any trivial manner from the 1935 FTC, this stay \ndecision admits of no cabining.  See J. Walker Op. 10 (The \nDecision of 1789 eliminated “any” Congressional control over \nremoval.), 14 (“[T]he President ha[s] inherent, inviolable, and \nunlimited  authority  to  remove  principal  officers  exercising \nsubstantial executive authority[.]”), 15 (Humphrey’s Executor \n“has few, if any, applications today.”), 20 (There can be no \nremoval protections for “any agency that wields the substantial \nexecutive power that Humphrey’s understood the 1935 FTC \nnot  to  exercise.”),  30  (Humphrey’s  Executor  cannot  be \nextended “to any new contexts[.]”), 36 (Removal protections \nare unconstitutional if the agency exercises “any” executive \npower.);  see  also  J.  Henderson  Op.  1  (questioning  “the \ncontinuing vitality of Humphrey’s”).  \n \n \n\n134a\n52 \nThat  would  mean  that  a  century-plus  of  politically \nindependent monetary policy is set to vanish with a pre-merits \nsnap of this court’s fingers.  A constitutional ruling that the \nPresident  has  unrestricted  removal  power  over  all \nmultimember agencies exercising any executive power directly \nthreatens  the  independence  of  numerous  multimember \nagencies,  including  the  Federal  Reserve  Board,  the  Open \nMarket Committee, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, the Chemical Safety and \nHazard  Investigation  Board,  and  the  National  Mediation \nBoard, among others. \n \nThe government insists that there is a special rule for the \nFederal Reserve Board.  Gov’t Reply Br. in Harris 8; Gov’t \nReply Br. in Wilcox 7–8.  The President does not agree.  While \nhis recent Executive Order chose to exempt “the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System” and “the Federal \nOpen Market Committee” from his “ongoing supervision and \ncontrol,” that carveout is limited only to their “conduct of \nmonetary  policy.”    Exec.  Order  No.  14,215,  Ensuring \nAccountability for All Agencies, 90 Fed. Reg. 10,447, 10,448 \n(Feb.  24,  2025).    As  to  all  other  Federal  Reserve  Board \nactivities, such as bank regulation, 12 U.S.C. § 1813(q)(3), and \nconsumer protection regulation, 15 U.S.C. § 1681m(e)(1), the \nExecutive Order claims unlimited power to remove members \nof the Federal Reserve Board for any reason or no reason at all, \n90 Fed. Reg. at 10,448.  That part-in-part-out approach allows \na President unhappy with monetary policy to fire one or all \nFederal Reserve members at will because he need not give any \nreason for a firing.  By definition, a right to remove someone \nfor no reason cannot be confined to certain reasons. \n   \nBeyond  that,  the  Executive  Order  does  not  disclaim \nauthority to remove members of the Federal Reserve or Federal \nOpen Market Committee going forward, and the government’s \n \n\n135a\n53 \nposition and Judge Walker’s opinion here admit of no such \nlimit.  Indeed, it is difficult to understand how it could, as the \ntheory that the President has illimitable removal authority is, \nby definition, a theory that there are no limits on the President’s \nauthority to remove every single executive official.7 \n \nAgencies are not the only entities at risk under the majority \nopinion’s new regime.  Given the primarily adjudicatory nature \nof the MSPB and the NLRB, it is difficult to understand how \nthe  majority  opinion’s  rule  does  not  eliminate  removal \nrestrictions on non-Article III judges, including judges of the \nCourt of Federal Claims, the Bankruptcy Courts, the Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims, and the Court of Appeals for the \nArmed Forces.  Apparently all of those adjudicators can now \nbe  fired  based  not  on  any  constitutional  decision  by  the \nSupreme Court or this court, but simply on the government’s \napplication for a stay citing nothing more than the President’s \ninability  to  fire  those  officials  as  the  requisite  irreparable \ninjury. \n \nSuch action fails to exhibit the normal “judicial humility” \nthat courts adopt at a preliminary stage when there is still \n \n7  To  the  extent  that  the  government  suggests  a  potential \nexemption for the Federal Reserve Board given its “unique historical \nbackground” and “special arrangement sanctioned by history,” see \nCFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America, \nLtd., 601 U.S. 416, 467 n.16 (2024) (Alito, J., dissenting), that \nexemption applies equally to the MSPB and NLRB, given that \nremoval restrictions on adjudicators like territorial and Claims Court \njudges and justices of the peace go back to the founding.  Since there \nis  no  basis  in  the  Constitution’s  text  or  separation-of-powers \nprinciples for minting an ad  hoc exception just for certain functions \nof one entity, the better lesson to draw from this history is that limited \nremoval restrictions for multimember and adjudicatory bodies are a \nmanifestation of the Constitution’s division of powers.     \n \n\n136a\n54 \n“grave uncertainty” about the merits.  Hanson v. District of \nColumbia, 120 F.4th 223, 247 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quoting O \nCentro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, \n389  F.3d  973,  1015  (10th  Cir.  2004)  (McConnell,  J., \nconcurring)).   \n \nV \n \nThe whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and \nturmoil.    But  the  court’s  decision  today  creates  them.    I \naccordingly respectfully dissent from the decision to grant a \nstay pending appeal. \n \n \n\n137a\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nGWYNNE A. WILCOX,\nPlaintiff,\nCivil Action No. 25-cv-334 \nv. \nJudge Beryl A. Howell \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity \nas President of the United States \nand \nMARVIN E. KAPLAN, in his official \ncapacity as Chairman of the National Labor \nRelations Board, \nDefendants. \nORDER \nYesterday evening, Friday, March 7, 2025, defendants President Donald J. Trump and \nMarvin E. Kaplan filed a motion to stay pending appeal this Court’s judgment, entered on March \n6, 2025, granting plaintiff Gwynne A. Wilcox’s motion for summary judgment and denying \ndefendants’ cross motion for summary judgment.  See Defs.’ Mot. to Stay (“Defs.’ Mot.”), ECF \nNo. 39.  This Court declared—as defendants conceded—that the President’s termination of \nplaintiff was unlawful, in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), 29 U.S.C. \n§153(a), and therefore null and void.  Order at 1, ECF No. 34.  In addition, this Court ordered\nthat plaintiff remains a duly appointed member of the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”)\nand enjoined the current NLRB Chair, defendant Kaplan, from “in any way treating plaintiff as \nhaving been removed from office, from impeding in any way her ability to fulfill her duties as a \nmember of the NLRB, and from denying or obstructing her authority or access to any benefits or \n1 \n\n138a\nresources of her office,”including by failing to“provide plaintiff with access to the necessary \ngovernment facilities and equipment so that she may carry out her duties during her term as a \nmember of the NLRB.”  Id. at 2.  Plaintiff promptly opposed defendants’ motion for a stay.  See \nPl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 40.  For the reasons explained below, defendants’ motion to stay this \nCourt’s Order is DENIED.  \n Whether a stay is appropriate depends on four factors: “(1) whether the stay applicant \nhas made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant \nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure \nthe other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).  \n“The first two factors of the traditional standard are the most critical,” id., and the showing of \nlikelihood of success must be “substantial,” Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Washington \n(“CREW”) v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 904 F.3d 1014, 1018 (D.C. Cir. 2018).   \nFor all of the reasons explained in this Court’s Memorandum Opinion, defendants have \nnot made the requisite showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits.  See Mem. Op. at \n10-29, ECF No. 35.  Defendants have conceded that the President violated the NLRA (29 U.S.C.\n§153(a)) when removing plaintiff from her presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed position\nas a member of the NLRB, without complying with the statutory procedural and for-cause \nrequirements for such removal, see id. at 5, and their constitutional challenge to that statute is \nforeclosed by binding precedent, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), \nsee Mem. Op. at 10-11.  Defendants’ reliance on case law pertaining to offices led by single \ndirectors instead of multimember boards, with staggered terms, thereby made accountable to the \nPresident through exercise of his appointment power—plus, at the NLRB, his at-will removal \n2\n\n139a\nand appointment power over the General Counsel who has investigatoryand prosecutorial \npowers—is exemplary of how their argument is unsupported by existing doctrine.  See Defs.’ \nMot. at 2 (citing Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. \nBureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), and Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052, 2025 WL 559669, at *14 \n(D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J. dissenting)). To be sure, defendants are intent on urging the \nSupreme Court to overrule Humphrey’s Executor, Defs.’ Cross Mot. for Summ. J. & Opp’n to \nPl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 8 n.2, ECF No. 23; but that aspiration is just that, and the essence of \nthe rule of law is that this Court may not anticipate changes to legal precedent that have not yet \ntranspired.  See Nat’l Sec. Archive v. CIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“This court is \ncharged with following case law that directly controls a particular issue, ‘leaving to [the \nSupreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.’” (alterations in original) \n(quoting Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, 136 (2023))); Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC, \n723 F. Supp. 3d 64, 71-72 (D.D.C. 2024) (“To give existing precedent anything less than its full \ndue based on speculation about what the Supreme Court might someday hold would exceed the \nauthority of this Court, would inject grave uncertainty in the legal landscape, and would \nundermine therule of law.”).\nDefendants’ failure to show likelihood of success is “an arguably fatal flaw for a stay \napplication,” CREW, 904 F.3d at 1019,but defendants also fail to satisfy the other factors.  \nDefendants do not describe any cognizable harm they will experience without a stay, let alone an \nirreparable one.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 3; see also Mem. Op. at 34-35 (noting the President can \nexercise control over the NLRB in ways other than removing plaintiff).  Plaintiff and the public, \non the other hand, experience harm every day that she is not able to fulfill her statutory role and \nthe NLRB is thus unable to function.  See Mem. Op. at 33-35.    \n3\n\n140a\nFinally, as plaintiff correctly notes, contrary to defendants’ suggestion, the D.C. Circuit’s \ngrant of an emergency stay pending appeal in Dellinger v.

The “unitary executive theory”—the theory, in its purest form, \nthat, under our tri-partite constitutional framework, executive power lodges in a single \nindividual, the President, who may thus exercise complete control over all executive branch\nsubordinates without interference by Congress—has been lauded by some as the hallmark of an \nenergetic, politically accountable government,whilerebuked by others as “anti-American,” a \n“myth,”and “invented history.”1  Both sides of the debate raise valid concerns, but this is no \n1 Compare, e.g., Steven G. Calabresi & Christopher S. Yoo, The Unitary Executive: Presidential Power from \nWashington to Bush (2008), Saikrishna B.

Prakash, The President's Power to Execute the Laws, \n104YALE L.J. 541, 597 (1994); with, e.g., Allen Shoenberger, The Unitary Executive Theory is Plainly Wrong and \nAnti-American: “Presidents are Not Kings,” 85 ALB.L.REV. 837, 837 (2022), Christine Kexel Chabot, Interring \nthe Unitary Executive, 98 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 129 (2022), and Lawrence Lessig & Cass R. Sunstein, The \nPresident and the Administration,94COLUM.L. REV. 1, 4 (1994) (“Any faithful reader of history must conclude that \nthe unitary executive . . . is just myth.”); Cass R. Sunstein, This Theory is Behind Trump’s Power Grab, N.Y.TIMES\n(Feb. 26, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/opinion/trump-roberts-unitary-executive-theory.html; see \n1\n\n142a\nmere academic exercise.2 The outcome of this debate has profound consequences for how we \nAmericans are governed.  On the one hand, democratic principles militateagainst a “headless \nfourth branch”3 made up of politically unaccountable, independent government entities that \nmight become agents of corrupt factions or private interest groups instead of the voting public. \nAdditionally, at least theoretically, empowering a President with absolute control over how the\nExecutive branch operates, including the power to “clean house” of federal employees, would \npromote efficient implementation of presidential policies and campaign promises that are \nresponsive to the national electorate.  On the other hand, the advantages of impartial, expert-\ndriven decision-making and congressional checks on executive authority favor some agency \nindependence from political changes in presidential administrations, with the concomitant \nbenefits of stability, reliability, and moderation in government actions.  No matter where these \npros and cons may lead, the crucial question here is, what does the U.S. Constitution allow?   \nTo start, the Framers made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to \nbe king—the President included—and not just in name only.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9, cl. 8 \n(“No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States.”).  Indeed, the very structure of the \nConstitution was designed to ensure no one branch of government had absolute power,despite \nalso Julian Davis Mortenson, The Executive Power Clause, 168 U.PA.L. REV. 1269, 1334 (2020) (describing “the \nexercise of executive power” as “fully subordinate to instructions by its legislative principal” at the founding). \n2\nThe academy has provided various formulations of the “unitary executive” theory.  See, e.g., Steven G. \nCalabresi & Kevin H. Rhodes, The Structural Constitution: Unitary Executive, Plural Judiciary, 105 HARV.L.REV. \n1153, 1158 (1992) (“Unitary executive theorists claim that all federal officers exercising executive power must be \nsubject to the direct control of the President.”); Lessig & Sunstein, supra, at 2 (“Many think that under our \nconstitutional system, the President must have the authority to control all government officials who implement the \nlaws.”); Chabot, supra, at 129 (2022) (describing the “unitary executive” theory as the idea that the Constitution \ngave the President “plenary removal power” affording him “‘exclusive control over subordinates’ exercise of \nexecutive power”).  \n3 Peter L. Strauss, The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 \nCOLUM.L.REV.573, 578 (1974) (quoting The President’s Comm. on Admin. Mgmt., Administrative Management \nin the Government of the United States 30 (1937)).  \n2\n\n143a\nthe perceived inefficiencies,inevitable delays, and seemingly anti-democratic consequences that\nmayflow from the checks and balances foundational to our constitutional system of governance. \nThe Constitution provides guideposts to govern inter-branch relations but does not fully \ndelineate the contours of the executive power or the degree to which the other two branches may \nplace checks on the President’s execution of the laws.  As pertinent here, the Constitution does \nnot, even once, mention “removal” of executive branch officers.  The only process to end federal \nservice provided in the Constitution is impeachment, applicable to limited offices (like judges \nand the President) after a burdensome political process.  See, e.g., id. art. II, § 4 (impeachment of \nPresident); id. art. III, § 1 (impeachment of federal judges).  This constitutional silence on \nremoval perplexed the First Congress, bedeviled a President shortly thereafter and a second \nPresident after the Civil War during Reconstruction (leading to condemnation of the former and \nimpeachment proceedings against the latter), and has beset jurists and scholars in our modern \nera.  See infra Part III.A.3.b.4\nYet, in assessing separation of powers, the Constitution itself is not theonly available\nguide.  Historical practice and a body of case law are, respectively, instructive andbinding.  See \ninfra Part III.A.1; e.g., Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 23 (2015)(“In \nseparation of powers cases this Court has often ‘put significant weight upon historical practice.’” \n(quoting NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 524(2014))). Both make clear that textual \n4 In 1834, President Andrew Jackson fired two Secretaries of the Treasury when each refused his order to \nremove U.S. funds from the Second National Bank, which Jackson viewed as having “resist[ed] his reelection in \npart with bank funds,” and these removal actions triggered a congressional condemnation resolution for an abuse of \npower.  See Lessig & Sunstein, supra n.1, at 78-80.  Jackson’s replacement as Secretary at Treasury, Roger Taney, \ndid as ordered and was later appointed Chief Justice.  Id. at 79.  The resolution condemning President Jackson was \nultimately expunged, in 1837, but not without significant debate and Jackson’s reputational decline.  See id. at 81-\n83.  \nOver thirty years later, in 1867, President Andrew Johnson’s removal of the Secretary of War in defiance of \na congressional statute led to his impeachment and near conviction.  Richard Murphy, 32 FED.PRAC. & PROC.JUD.\nREV. § 8128 (2d ed.) (2024).  \n3\n\n144a\nsilence regarding removal does not confer absolute authority on a President to willy-nilly \noverride a congressional judgment that expertise and insulation from direct presidential control \ntake priority when a federal officer is tasked with carrying out certain adjudicative or \nadministrative functions.  As Justice Louis Brandeis eloquently opined, “[c]hecks and balances \nwere established in order that this should be ‘a government of laws and not of men,’” observing \nfurther that the separation of powers was not adopted “to promote efficiency but to preclude the \nexercise of arbitrary power.  The purpose was, not to avoid friction, but, by means of the \ninevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three \ndepartments, to save the people from autocracy.”  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 292-93\n(1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). \nA President who touts an image of himself as a “king” ora “dictator,”5 perhaps as his \nvision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. \nConstitution.  In our constitutional order, the President is tasked to be a conscientious custodian \nof the law, albeit an energetic one, to take care of effectuating his enumerated duties, including \nthe laws enacted by the Congress and as interpreted by the Judiciary.  U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 3\n(“[H]e shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. . . .”). At issue in this case, is the \nPresident’s insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive \nbranch, overriding any congressionallymandated law in his way.  See Letter from Sarah Harris, \nActing Solicitor General, to Sen. Richard Durbin on Restrictions on the Removal of Certain \n5 See @WhiteHouse, X (Feb. 19, 2025, 1:58 PM), https://perma.cc/V9Y2-SWRD (“LONG LIVE THE \nKING!”); WSJ News, Trump Says He Won’t Be a Dictator “Except for Day One” if Re-Elected, YOUTUBE(DEC. 6,\n2023), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQkrWL7YuGk; see also @realDonaldTrump, X (Feb. 15, 2025, 1:32 \nPM), https://perma.cc/S5GR-BXF5 (“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”).  Some of defendants’ \nsupporting amici also draw analogies to the British monarchy; Tennessee has described the tradition of the British \nking’s “‘prerogative power to remove’ executive officers ‘at will,’” which “carried into the United States.”  \nTennessee’s Amicus Br. at 5-6 (quoting Michael W. Connell, The President Who Would Not Be King 162 (2020)).  \nIn a democracy created to repudiate that very regime, that analogy has little purchase.    \n4\n\n145a\nPrincipal Officers of the United States (“Letter from Acting SG”) (Feb. 12, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/D67G-FKK4(describing the Trump administration’s view of the removal \npower).  Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article \nII, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on \npresidential authority.  The President’s interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power—\nor, more aptly, his aspiration—is flat wrong.  \nThe President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor \nRelations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a \nblatant violation of the law. Defendants concede that removal of plaintiff as a Board Member \nviolates the terms of the applicable statute, seeMotions H’rg(Mar. 5, 2025),Rough Tr. at 51:12-\n13, and because this statute is a valid exercise of congressional power, the President’s excuse for \nhis illegal act cannot be sustained.  \nI. BACKGROUND\nThe statutory and procedural background relevant to resolving this dispute is summarized\nbelow. \nA. Statutory Background\nThe National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) was established ninety years ago by \nCongress in the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) in response to a long and violent \nstruggle for workers’ rights.  See generally, J. Warren Madden, Origin and Early Years of the \nNational Labor Relations Act, 18HASTINGS L.J. 571 (1967); Arnold Ordman, Fifty Years of the \nNLRA: An Overview, 88 W.VA. L. REV. 15, 15-16 (1985).  Congress sought to protect industrial \npeace and stability in labor relations and thus created a board to resolve efficiently labor disputes \nand protect the rights of employees to “self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor \norganizations [and] to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.” 29 \n5\n\n146a\nU.S.C. §157; see also id. § 151; Crey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 375 U.S. 261, 271 (1964)\n(describing these goals); Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. v. NLRB, 338 U.S. 355, 362 (1949)(same). \nThe NLRB is a “bifurcated agency”consisting, on one side, of a five-member, quasi-\njudicial “Board” that adjudicates appeals of labor disputes from administrative law judges \n(“ALJs”), and on the other, of a General Counsel (“GC”) and several Regional Directors who \nprosecute unfair labor practices and enforce labor law and policy.  See NLRB, Who We Are, \nhttps://perma.cc/9RLA-FSYL; 29 U.S.C. §§ 153(a), (d), 160; Starbucks v. McKinney, 602 U.S. \n339, 357 (2024) (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The two sides operate \nindependently, with the GC independent of the Board’s control.  NLRB v. United Food & Com. \nWorkers Union, Local 23, AFL-CIO, 484 U.S. 112, 117-18 (1987) (describing how the Labor \nManagement Relations Act of 1947 amended the NLRA to separate the prosecutorial and \nadjudicatory functions between the Board and General Counsel).   \nThe NLRB generally addresses labor disputes as follows: Upon the filing of a “charge” \nby an employer, employee, or labor union, a team working under the Regional Director will \ninvestigate and decide whether to pursue the allegation as a formal complaint.  See NLRB, \nInvestigate Charges, https://perma.cc/CU82-KU4V.6 If the parties do not settle and the Director \nformally pursues the complaint, the Directorwill issuenotice of a hearing before an ALJ.  Id.; 29 \nU.S.C. §160(b); 29 C.F.R. § 101.10; Starbucks, 602 U.S. at 342-43.7 If necessary, after \nissuance of a complaint, the Board may seek temporary injunctive relief in federal district court\nwhile the dispute is pending at the NLRB.  29 U.S.C. § 160(j); Starbucks, 602 U.S. at 342.  The \n6 The initial request made by the employee, union, or employer is referred to as a “charge”; only the Director \nissues a “complaint.”   NLRB, What We Do, https://perma.cc/CU82-KU4V. \n7 If the parties do formally settle after issuance of a complaint, Board approval is required.  NLRB, 484 U.S. \nat 120. \n6\n\n147a\nALJ then gathers evidence and presents “a proposed report, together with a recommended order \nto the Board.”  29 U.S.C. §160(c). That order will become the order of the Board unless the \nparties file “exceptions.”  Id.; 29 C.F.R. §§ 101.11-.12.  If the parties file exceptions requesting \nthe Board’s review, the Board will consider the ALJ’s recommendation, gather additional facts \nas necessary, and issue a decision.  29 U.S.C. § 160(c); 29 C.F.R. § 101.12.  The Board may craft \nrelief, such as a cease-and-desist order to halt unfair labor practices or an order requiring \nreinstatement of terminated employees.  29 U.S.C. § 160(c).  These orders, however, are not \nindependently enforceable; the Board must seek enforcement in a federal court of appeals (and \nmay appoint attorneys to do so).  Id. §§ 154, 160(e); In re NLRB, 304 U.S. 486, 495 (1938) \n(noting compliance with a Board order is not obligatory until entered as a decree by a court).  \nAside from adjudicating disputes, the Board may also conduct and certify the outcome of union \nelections, 29 U.S.C. § 159, and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out its statutory duties, \nid. § 156.   \nAlthough both the Board members and the GC are appointed by the President with \n“advice and consent” from the Senate, id. §§ 153(a), (d), only the Board is protected from \nremoval at-will by the President, who is authorized to remove a Board member “upon notice and \nhearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause,” id. § 153(a).  Such \nrestrictions were intentional; much like many other multimember entities, the Board was \ndesigned to be an independent panel of experts that could impartially adjudicate disputes.  See 29 \nU.S.C. § 153(a); Kirti Datla & Richard L. Revesz, Deconstructing Independent Agencies (and \nExecutive Agencies), 98 CORNELL L. REV. 76, 770-71 (2013) (describing the NLRB as a classic \nexample of an agency designed to be independent).  Board members serve staggered five-year \nterms, and the President is authorized to designate one board member as Chairman.  29 U.S.C. \n7\n\n148a\n§153(a). In practice, the Board is partisan-balanced based on longstanding norms, though such a\nbalance is not statutorily mandated.  See Brian D. Feinstein & Daniel J. Hemel, Partisan Balance \nwith Bite, 118 COLUM.L. REV.9, 54-55 (2018).  \nB. Factual Background\nAs set out in plaintiff’s complaint and statement of material facts, and undisputed by \ndefendants, plaintiff Gwynne Wilcox was nominated by President Biden and confirmed by the \nU.S. Senate to a second five-year term as member of the NLRB in September 2023.

J., Statement of\nUndisputed Material Facts (“Defs.’ SUMF”) ¶ 2, ECF No. 23-2.  She was designated Chair of \nthe Board in December 2024.  Complaint ¶ 12, ECF No. 1.   \nShortly after taking office, President Trump moved Marvin Kaplan, a then-sitting Board\nmember and a defendant in this case, into the position of Chair, replacing plaintiff.  Id. ¶ 13.  \nPresident Trump then, on January 27, 2025, terminated plaintiff from her position on the Board \nvia an email sent shortly before 11:00 PM, by the Deputy Director of the White House \nPresidential Personnel Office.  Pl.’s Decl., Ex. A, ECF No. 10-4; Pl.’s SMF ¶ 3; Defs.’ SUMF \n¶ 3.  The termination was not preceded by “notice and hearing,” nor was any “neglect of duty or \nmalfeasance” identified, despite the explicit restrictions to removal of a Board member in the \nNLRA.  Pl.’s Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Pl.’s SMF ¶¶4-5; Defs.’SUMF ¶ 5 (regarding lack of notice and \nhearing); Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), Rough Tr. at 51:10-17. The email instead cited only \npolitical motivations—that plaintiff does not share the objectives of the President’s \nadministration—and asserted, in a footnote, that the restriction on the President’s removal \nauthority is unconstitutional as “inconsistent with the vesting of the executive Power in the \nPresident.”  Pl.’s Decl. ¶ 3; Ex. A.   \n8\n\n149a\nThe NLRB’s Director of Administration, who reports directly to Mr. Kaplan, began the \ntermination process, cutting off plaintiff’s access to her accounts and instructing her to clean out \nher office.  Pl.’s Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.  The Board already had two vacancies, andnow,without plaintiff, \nit is reduced to only two sitting members—one short of the three-member quorum required to \noperate.  Compl. ¶ 18; 29 U.S.C. § 153(b).  Removal of plaintiff has thus stymied the functioning \nof the Board.  \nPlaintiff filed the instant suit, challenging her removal and requesting injunctive relief \nagainst Mr. Kaplan so that she may resume her congressionally mandated role.  See Compl. \n¶¶ 21-22.  Recognizing that this case involves a pure question of law, plaintiffmoved for \nexpedited summary judgment,on February 10, 2025, Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 10, anddefendants \nresponded with a cross-motion for summary judgment, with briefing completed on a condensed \nschedule.  See Defs.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. (“Defs.’ \nOpp’n”), ECF No. 23; Pl.’s Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross-Mot. and Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ.

Interested parties also weighed in as amici.8  Following a hearing, held on March \n5, 2025, the parties’cross-motions for summary judgement are ready for resolution.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nSummary judgment shall be granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R.CIV.P.\n56(a).  A fact is only “‘material’ if a dispute over it might affect the outcome of a suit under the \n8 Amici include: the Constitutional Accountability Center (“CAC”) and a cohort of nineteen states and the \nDistrict of Columbia, led by Minnesota, writing in support of plaintiff, see CAC’s Amicus Br., ECF No. 15; \nNineteen States & D.C.’s Amicus Br., ECF No. 31; and Tennessee and a cohort of twenty states, led by Florida, \nwriting in support of defendants, see Tennessee’s Amicus Br., ECF No. 18; Twenty States’ Amicus Br., ECF No. \n26.\n9\n\n150a\ngoverning law; factual disputes that are ‘irrelevant or unnecessary’ do not affect the summary \njudgment determination.”  Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  The dispute is only “genuine” if \n“the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.”  Id. \n(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).   \nA plaintiff “seeking a permanent injunction . . . must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered \nan irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between \nthe plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest \nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  Monsanto Co v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 \nU.S. 139, 156-57 (2010) (quoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)). \nIII. DISCUSSION\nIn the ninety years since the NLRB’s founding, the President has never removeda\nmember of the Board.  Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 4, ECF No. 10-2.  His \nattempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal \nact are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice.  For the reasons \nexplained below, plaintiff’s motion is granted.  Plaintiff’s termination from the Board was \nunlawful, and Mr. Kaplan and his subordinates are ordered to permit plaintiff to carry out all of \nher duties as a rightful, presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed member of the Board.  \nA. Humphrey’s Executor and its Progeny are Binding on this Court.\nThe Board is a paradigmatic example of a multimember group of experts who lead an \nindependent federal office.  Since the early days of the founding of this country, Congress, the \nPresident, and the Supreme Court all understood that Congress could craft executive offices with \nsome independence, as a check on presidential authority.  That understanding has not changed \n10\n\n151a\nover the 150-year history of independent, multimember commissions,nor over the 90-year \nhistory of the NLRB. The Supreme Court recognized this history and tradition in Humphrey’s \nExecutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), inupholding removal protections for such \nboards or commissions, and this precedent remains not only binding law, but also awell-\nreasoned reflection of the balance of power between the political branches sanctioned by the \nConstitution.  \n1. Removal Restrictions on Board Members are Well-Grounded in History\nand Binding Precedent.\nAs a textual matter, the Constitution is silent as to removals.  See In re Hennen, 38 U.S. \n230, 258 (1839).  Consequently, though Article II grants the President authority over some \nappointments—with advice and consent of the Senate—and vests in him the “executive power,” \nArticle II contains no express authority from which to infer an absolute removal power.   \nCompare U.S.CONST.art. II, § 1, cl. 1 (vesting clause), and id., § 2, cl. 2 (appointments clause); \ntoid. art. I,§8, cl. 18(clause granting Congress the authority “to make all laws” “necessary and \nproper” for carrying out its powers and “all other Powers vested . . . in the Government”).  The \nSupreme Court has held that a general power to remove executive officers can be inferred from \nArticle II, see Myers,272 U.S. at 163-64, yet the contours of that removal powerand the extent\nto whichCongress may impose constraints are nowhere clearly laid out.  \nThe courts in such cases must therefore turn to established precedent—judicial decisions\nas well as general practice and tradition.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that \n“‘traditional ways of conducting government . . . give meaning’ to the Constitution.”  Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 401 (1989) (alteration in original) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & \nTube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 610 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)).  Thus, “[i]n \nseparation-of-powers cases this Court has often‘put significant weight upon historical practice.’”  \n11\n\n152a\nZivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 23 (quoting Noel Canning, 573 U.S. at 524). Even when the validity of a \nparticular power is in question, the Court will, “in determining the . . . existence of [that] power,” \ngive weight to “the usage itself,” United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. 459, 473 (1915), \nand “hesitate to upset the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of \nGovernment themselves have reached,” Noel Canning, 573 U.S. at 526.  Justice Frankfurter in \nhis seminal concurring opinion in Youngstown declared that “systematic, unbroken” practice \ncould even “be treated as a gloss on ‘executive Power’ vested in the President.”  343 U.S. at 610-\n11.   \nNot only are the removal protections on members of the independent, multimember \nboards like the NLRB supported by over a century of unbroken practice, but they have also been \nexpressly upheld in clear Supreme Court precedent.  Since 1887, Congress has created multiple \nindependent offices led by panels whose members are appointed by the President but removable \nonly for cause.  See, e.g., Interstate Commerce Act, Pub. L. No. 49-41, ch. 104, § 11, 24 Stat. \n379, 383 (1887) (creating the Interstate Commerce Commission, with restrictions on officers’ \nremoval except for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance”); Federal Reserve Act, Pub. L. \nNo. 63-64, ch. 6, § 10, 38 Stat. 251, 260-61 (1913) (creating the Federal Reserve Board, whose \nmembers are removable only “for cause”).  In 1914, Congress established the Federal Trade \nCommission (“FTC”) with an “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” removal \nrestriction for its five commissioners.  FTC Act, Pub. L. No. 63-203, ch. 311, § 1, 38 Stat. 717, \n717-18 (1914).\nThe Supreme Court explicitly upheld removal restrictions for such boards when \nconsidering removal protections for the commissioners of the FTC in Humphrey’s Executor in \n1935, while also recognizing the President’s general authority over removal of executive branch \n12\n\n153a\nofficials.  The Court noted that commissioners of the FTC, “like the Interstate Commerce \nCommission” “are called upon to exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts ‘appointed \nby law and informed by experience.’”  Id. at 624 (quoting Ill. Cent. R.R. Co. v. Interstate Com. \nComm’n, 206 U.S. 441, 454 (1907)).  Congress, having the power to create such expert \ncommissions with quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial authority, must also have, “as an \nappropriate incident, power to fix the period during which they shall continue, and to forbid their \nremoval for except for cause in the meantime.”  Id. at 629.   \nTwo months later, with the guidance supplied in Humphrey’s Executor and following the \nmodel of the FTC as endorsed by the Supreme Court there, Congress established the National \nLabor Relations Board.  See Madden, supra, at 572-73; Yapp USA Auto. Sys., Inc. v. NLRB, --F. \nSupp. 3d--, No. 24-cv-12173, 2024 WL 4119058, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Sep. 9, 2024).  Both \nentities—the FTC and NLRB—have five-memberleadership boards with staggered terms of \nseveral years, minimizing instability and allowing for expertise to accrue.  See 29 U.S.C. \n§153(a); Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 216 (2020). Both were\nintended to exercise impartial judgment.  See Datla & Revesz, supra, at 770-71(describing \nindependence of the NLRB); Seila L., 591 U.S. at 215-16 (describing the FTC as “designed to be \n‘non-partisan’ and ‘to act with entire impartiality’” (quoting Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 U.S. at 624)).\nThe Board, like the FTC, is “predominately quasi judicial and quasi legislative” in nature, with \nthe primary responsibility of impartially reviewing decisions made by ALJs.  Humphrey’s Ex’r, \n292 U.S. at 624; see 29 U.S.C. § 160.  In fact, the Board does not prosecute labor cases nor \nenforce its rulings.  The side of the NLRB managed by the General Counsel—who is removable \nat-will by the President—carries out those more “executive” powers.  See 29 U.S.C. § 153(d) \n(describing the General Counsel’s “final authority, on behalf of the Board” over “the \n13\n\n154a\ninvestigation of charges and issuance of complaints . . . and . . . the prosecution of such \ncomplaints before the Board”).  As plaintiff correctly states, the Board closely resembles the \nFTC and is thus “squarely at the heart of the rule adopted in Humphrey’s Executor.”  Pl.’s Mem. \nat 9.   \nNumerous other offices have followed the mold of the NLRB and FTC with \nmultimember independent leadership boards protected from at-will removal by the President.  \nSee Pl.’s Mem. at 7 n.2 (listing, e.g., the Merit Systems Protection Board, 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d); the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority, 5 U.S.C. § 7104(b); and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, 42 U.S.C. § 7171(b)(1)).  “Since the Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey’s \nExecutor, the constitutionality of independent [multimember] agencies, whose officials possess \nsome degree of removal protection that insulates them from unlimited and instantaneous political \ncontrol, has been uncontroversial.”  Leachco, Inc. v.

Courts have also recently upheld restrictions on removal under \nHumphrey’s Executor for other multimember boards, such as the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission (“CPSC”).  See, e.g., Leachco, 103 F.4th at 761-62; Consumers’ Rsch. v. CPSC, 91 \nF.4th 342, 352 (5th Cir. 2024); United States v. SunSetter Prods. LP, No. 23-cv-10744, 2024 WL\n1116062, at *4 (D. Mass. Mar. 14, 2024).  The same has been true for the FTC.  See, e.g., \nIllumina, Inc. v. FTC, 88 F.4th 1036, 1046-47 (5th Cir. 2023); Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC, 723 \nF.Supp. 3d 64, 87 (D.D.C. 2024).

The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards \nor commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal \nprotections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here.\n2. Defendants’ Argument that Humphrey’s Executor Does Not Control\nFails.\nDiscounting this robust history, defendants posit that the President’s removal power is \nfundamentally “unrestricted” and that only two, narrow “exceptions” have been recognized: one \nfor “inferior officers with narrowly defined duties,” as established in Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654 (1988), and the other for “multimember bod[ies] of experts, balanced along partisan \nlines, that performed legislative and judicial functions and [do not] exercise any executive \npower,” as established in Humphrey’s Executor.  Defs.’ Opp’nat 5-6 (second passage quoting \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 216).  According to defendants, neither exception applies to the Board.  Id. \nat 6.  Putting aside to address later whether congressional authority to constrain the President’s \n15\n\n156a\nremoval authority is characterized fairlyby defendants as anarrow “exception” to the ruleof \n“unrestricted” removal power, see infraPart III.A.3.b, Humphrey’s Executor plainly controls. \nDefendants emphasize that Humphrey’s Executor understood the FTC at the time not to \nexercise any “executive power,” which was key to its “exception,” and that the NLRB today \nclearly “wield[s] substantial executive power.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 6-8 (relying on Seila L., 591 \nU.S. at 216 n.2, 218); see also Defs.’ Reply at 3.  They do not, however, meaningfully \ndistinguish between the authority of the FTC in 1935, as recognized in Humphrey’s Executor,\nand the authority of the NLRB today.  The FTC in 1935 had powers mimicking those of both the \nBoard and the NLRB’s GC.  The FTC had broad powers of investigation and could issue a \ncomplaint and hold a hearing for potential unfair methods of competition.  See Humphrey’s Ex’r, \n295 U.S. at 620, 621; see also 15 U.S.C. § 49 (authorizing the FTC’s subpoena power).  The \nFTC, upon finding a violation, could issue a cease-and-desist order and then go to the Court of \nAppeals for enforcement.  Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 U.S. at 620-21; see also FTC Act, ch. 311, § 5, \n38 Stat. at 719-20.  The party subject to the order could also appeal to that court.  Humphrey’s \nEx’r, 295 U.S. at 621.  Further, the FTC could issue rules and regulations regarding unfair and \ndeceptive acts.  See FTC Act, § 6, 38 Stat. at 722; Hon. R. E. Freer, Member of the FTC, \nRemarks on the FTC, its Powers and Duties at 2 (1940), \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/676771/19400827_freer_remarks\n_._rational_association_of_credit_jewelers.pdf.   \nThe NLRB’s collective authority, though comparable, see supra Part I.A (describing the \nNLRB’s GC’s authority to investigate and pursue enforcement against unfair labor practices and \nthe Board’s adjudicatory authority and power to issue unenforceable cease-and-desist orders), is, \nif anything, less extensive than that of the FTC.  The NLRB hardly engages in rulemaking (other \n16\n\n157a\nthan to establish its own procedures), instead relying on adjudications for the setting of \nprecedential guidance.  See Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 \n(1998) (“The [NLRB], uniquely among major federal administrative agencies, has chosen to \npromulgate virtually all the legal rules in its field through adjudication rather than rulemaking.”).  \nMoreover, the aspects of the NLRB’s authority most executive in nature—prosecutorial authority \nto investigate and bring civil enforcement actions—are tasks assigned to the GC instead of the \nBoard itself.  See 29 U.S.C. § 153(d).10\nEven though the Supreme Court of 1935 may have not referred to these classic \nadministrative powers as “executive” and the Supreme Court today would, see, e.g., Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 216 n.2, the substantive nature of authority granted to these two independent \ngovernment entities does not significantly differ.  If the Supreme Court has determined that \nremoval restrictions on officers exercising substantially the same authority do not impermissibly \nintrude upon presidential authority, Humphrey’s Executor cannot be read to allow a different \noutcome here.  That is especially true considering that the Supreme Court, in its next major \ndecision addressing removal protections for executive branch officers, rejected the notion that \nthe permissibility of “‘good cause’-type restriction[s] . . . turn[s] on whether or not th[e] official” \n10 Defendants suggest that because the NLRB makes “significant decisions shaping the rights and obligations \nof Americans” and “set[ting] federal labor policy,” the “constitutional calculus” is different, and the Humphrey’s \nExecutor “exception” cannot apply.  Defs.’ Reply at 3, 5; Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), Rough Tr. at 54:1-7 (citing \nNLRB v. Curtin Matheson Sci., Inc., 494 U.S. 775, 786 (1990) (“[T]he NLRB has the primary responsibility for \ndeveloping and applying national labor policy.”)).  Defendants do not, however, explain how applying federal law in \nindividual adjudications establishes “federal labor policy” any more than the rulemaking and adjudications of the \nFTC in Humphrey’s Executor do, nor do they explain why subsequent caselaw—see supra Part III.A.3.a—should be \nread as putting such a gloss on the holding of Humphrey’s.  Plaintiff contributed little to the debate about the scope \nof the NLRB’s powers that may be considered “executive,” simply tying its authorities closely to the FTC in 1935, \ndespite the NLRB’s bifurcated structure, resulting in a more cabined exercise of any executive authority by the \nBoard itself.  See Pl.’s Reply at 3-5; see also Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), Tr. at 23:5-13 (plaintiff’s counsel stating, \n“answering the question about exactly what ‘executive’ means and what those terms ‘quasi-legislative’ and \n‘quasijudicial’ mean, it’s not the easiest thing in the world.

See \nMorrison, 487 U.S. at 689.11\nDefendants make a final, superficial distinction between the NLRB and the FTC to argue \nthat the precedent of Humphrey’s Executor should not apply.  Defs.’ Opp’nat 10.  The NLRB, \nthey note, has stricter removal protections because its members cannot be removed for \n“inefficiency,” whereas FTC members can.  Id.  In both Consumers’ Research, 91 F.4th at 346, \n355-56, and Leachco, 103 F.4th at 761-63, however, courts of appeals upheld removal\nprotections that did not include an exception for “inefficiency.”  “Inefficiency” does not differ in \nsubstance from “neglect of duty,” so omitting “inefficiency” as a grounds for removal cannot be \na dispositive difference in the President’s ability to exercise his Article II powers over the \nNLRB.  See Jane Manners & Lev Menand, The Three Permissions: Presidential Removal and \nthe Statutory Limits of Agency Independence, 121 COLUM. L. REV. 1, 8, 69 (2021) (explaining \n11 Defendants’ argument about the exercise of “executive power” is ultimately tautological and leaves \nHumphrey’s Executor completely devoid of force.  They reason that because the NLRB is housed within the \nexecutive branch, the Board inherently exercises “executive power.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 7 (citing Seila L., 591 U.S. at \n216 n.2 (quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 305 n.4 (2013))).  Reading Humphrey’s Executor to allow \nremoval protections only for offices that do not exercise “executive power,” defendants then conclude that the \nNLRB does not fit within Humphrey’s Executor.  The necessary implication of such reasoning is that no board or \ncommission placed with the executive branch could, as a constitutional matter, be legally subject to removal \nprotections duly enacted by Congress. Yet, defendants dodge that extraordinary result and contradictorily suggest \nthat removal protections on the Federal Reserve Board are acceptable because that Board does not exercise an \n“executive function.”  Defs.’ Reply at 5; see also Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), Rough Tr. at 59-60 (defense counsel \ndeclining to discuss Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee or why these entities should be \ntreated differently than the NLRB as to presidential removal power).  \nRecognizing that the exercise of “executive power” could not be dispositive, the Fifth Circuit in \nConsumers’ Research agreed with the plaintiffs there that the CPSC “wields substantial executive power” but still \nheld that the CPSC was constitutional under Humphrey’s Executor.  91 F.4th at 353-55 (“Having concluded that the \nCommission exercises substantial executive power (in the modern sense), we must next consider whether that \ncharacteristic—standing alone—removes the Commission from the Humphrey's exception. We conclude that it does \nnot . . . .”).  The Fifth Circuit examined the other factors in Seila Law to conclude that the removal protections for \nCPSC members were constitutionally sound: The CPSC does not have a novel structure or present a historically \nunprecedented situation; the CPSC does not have a single director but rather a multimember board; and the CPSC \ndoes not have any of the other features that concerned the Court in Seila Law, such as the receipt of funds outside \nthe appropriation process or the inability of the President to influence the office’s leadership through the \nappointment power.  See id.   \nRegardless whether the NLRB exercises “substantial executive power,” “executive power,” or “quasi-\nlegislative and quasi-judicial power,” the NLRB does not sufficiently differ from the FTC to warrant a departure \nfrom Humphrey’s Executor.  \n18\n\n159a\nthat the absence of “inefficiency” as a ground for removal does not unconstitutionally interfere \nwith the President's authority).  Defendants offer no reason to suggest otherwise. The NLRB fits \nwell within the scope of Humphrey’s Executor.   \n3. Defendants’ Argument that Humphrey’s Executor Has Been\n“Repudiated” and is No Longer Good Law Is Not Persuasive.\nFundamentally, the position of defendants and their supporting state amici urging this \nCourt not to apply Humphrey’s Executor stems from a reading of the Supreme Court’s \nsubsequent case law as “repudiat[ing]” the precedent.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 9 (quoting Seila L., 591 \nU.S. at 239 (Thomas, J., concurring in part)); Tennessee’s Amicus Br. at 7-10, ECF No. 18 \n(arguing forcefully that Humphrey’s Executor was wrongly decided and has been “narrowed . . . \nnearly out of existence”); Twenty States’ Amicus Br. at 3-8, ECF No. 26.  Defendants therefore \nargue that Humphrey’s Executor must be read extremely narrowly, despite that “whatever little \nremains” is binding on this Court.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 n.2.  To the contrary, an unbroken line of \ncases since Humphrey’s Executor has reinforced the constitutionality of removal restrictions on \nmultimember expert boards, and the pre-Humphrey’s Executor history demonstrates that this \ndecision was well-grounded in accepted principles of checks and balances. \na. Post-Humphrey’s Executor Case Law Reinforces its Central\nHolding.\nIn every case following Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court has preserved the \nconstitutionality of removal protections on independent, multimember boards and commissions. \nShortly following Humphrey’s Executor, in Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the \nCourt held that the Constitution did not grant the President authority to remove members of the \nmultimember War Claims Commission “for no reason other than that he preferred to have on \nthat Commission men of his own choosing.”  Id. at 355-56.  Thirty years later, in Morrison, the \nCourt again recognized the exception to the President’s removal power for officers with \n19\n\n160a\nadjudicatory powers, but further explained that the permissibility of removal restrictions did not \nturn on whether the officers’ functions were “quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial,” as opposed to \nexecutive in nature, instead looking to the degree to which they impeded the President’s ability \nto execute the laws.  See 487 U.S. at 691-93 (upholding removal protections for independent \ncounsel contained in the Ethics in Government Act).   \nThen, in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477 \n(2010), the Court reiterated its holding in Humphrey’s Executor that “Congress can, under \ncertain circumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the \nPresident, whom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause” and declined to \nreexamine that precedent.  Id. at 483 (striking down double for-cause removal protections); see \nalso Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 537 F.3d 667, 686 (D.C. Cir. 2008) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (describing the defendants as attempting to compare the office’s \nremoval protections to that of “the FCC, the FTC, and the NLRB,” which were understood to be \n“permissible under the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor”).   \nMost recently, in Seila Law, the Supreme Court likewise declined to “revisit [its] prior \ndecisions allowing certain limitations on the President’s removal power.”  591 U.S. at 204.  \nWhile defendants make much of dicta in this decision, such as that the FTC’s powers would now \nbe considered executive, Defs.’ Opp’n at 9; see also Tennessee’s Amicus Br. at 9, Seila Law \nmade key distinctions between single-head offices and multimember boards or commissions that \nreinforce why placing restrictions on removal of leaders of the latter is not problematic under our \nConstitution, see 591 U.S. at 224-26.  Despite restrictions on removal, the President can exercise \nmore control over a multimember board through his appointment power as vacancies arise, and \nwith staggered terms, some Board vacancies arise during each administration.  See id. at 225.  \n20\n\n161a\nThose new appointees can restrain the Board member the President might otherwise prefer to \nremove, and no President will be “saddled” with a single “holdover Director from a competing \npolitical party who is dead set against” his agenda.  Id. at 225 (emphasis in original).  That is \nparticularly the case here, where President Trump could exercise near total control over the \nNLRB by appointing two members of his choosing to the Board to join Mr. Kaplan, whom the \nPresident appointed during his first term and recently elevated to Chairman, creating a majority \nof Trump appointees, and by appointing a General Counsel of his choice.  See NLRB, Members \nof the NLRB Since 1935, https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/the-board/members-of-\nthe-nlrb-since-1935 (last visited Mar. 5, 2025); 29 U.S.C. § 153(d) (allowing the General \nCounsel to be removed at will).12\nMoreover, the multimember structure prevents the public from being subject to decisions \nmade unilaterally by an unelected official, who could become captured by private interests.  The \ndistribution of power among several individuals on the Board “avoids concentrating power in the \nhands of any single individual.”  Seila L., 591 U.S. at 222-23.  Lastly, unlike single-head offices, \nentities led by multimember boards have a robust basis—more than even a “foothold”—in \n“history [and] tradition.”  Id. at 222.  Forthese reasons, when the Court ultimately invalidated \nthe removal restrictions on the CFPB’s director as a singlehead of the bureau, Chief Justice \nRoberts expressly suggested that “converting the CFPB into a multimember agency” would solve \n“the problem.”  Id. at 237.13   \n12 Instead, by bringing the Board to a complete halt, the President has foreclosed his own ability to see his \nBoard appointees effectuate his agenda and has frozen the functioning of an important government office. \n13 The Supreme Court’s most recent removal protections case, Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), was \nlikewise about an office led by a single director, and the Court there reaffirmed it “did ‘not revisit [its] prior \ndecisions allowing certain limitations on the President’s removal power’” in Seila Law.  Id. at 250-51 (quoting Seila \nL., 591 U.S. at 204).   \n21\n\n162a\nFinally, two months ago, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Leachco, where the \nTenth Circuit upheld removal protections for commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission under Humphrey’s Executor—once again, declining to revisit that precedent.  See \n103 F.4th 748 (10th Cir. 2024), cert. denied No. 24-156, 2025 WL 76435 (U.S. Jan. 13, 2025). \nb. Presidential Removal Power Has Never Been Viewed as\nUnrestricted.\nDefendants and their supporting states’ amici go even further in suggesting that not only \nhas Humphrey’s Executor been repudiated over time but the opinion was also wrong at the time \nit was decided. Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 n.2, 9; Tennessee’s Amicus Br. at 7; see Twenty States’ \nAmicus Br. at 6-7.  Defendants read Humphrey’s predecessor, Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. \n52 (1926), as formalizing the President’s “unrestricted removal power,” which ultimately derives \nfrom the “vesting” clause in Article II establishing a “unitary” executive.  Defs.’ Reply at 1-2 \n(first passage quoting Seila L., 591 U.S. at 215); Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), Rough Tr. at \n30:22-31:4 (plaintiff’s counsel describing Myers as a “building block” in the unitary executive \ntheory).  They are again misguided.  While the Myers Court made clear that the President has a \ngeneral removal power for executive officials, defendants’ myopic focus on this case loses sight \nof the limitations in its holding, a point driven home in Humphrey’s Executor decided less than a \ndecade later.  Nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has \nsuggested the President’s removal power is absolute.  In fact, the history upon which Myers \nrelies and the immediately following Supreme Court decisions undercut any view that Congress, \nwhen exercising its constitutional authority to shape executive offices, is completely barred from \nconditioning the President’s exercise of his removal authority.   \nIn Myers, Chief Justice Taft—the only person to have served both as the President and a \nJustice of the Supreme Court—recounted and relied on the history of the Decision of 1789, a \n22\n\n163a\ncongressional debate about the President’s removal powers during the First Congress, to declare \nunconstitutional a statute requiring the “advice and consent of the Senate” for both appointment \nand removal of federal postmasters.  See 272 U.S. at 107, 111-36, 176-77.14  The First Congress \nhad created the first three executive departments, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, War, and \nTreasury, and after much debate,ultimately granted plenary removal power to the President over \nthe Secretary of Foreign Affairs and crafted that agency to be an arm of the President.  Id. at 145; \nsee also Lawrence Lessig & Cass R. Sunstein, The President and the Administration, 94COLUM.\nL.REV.1, 25-29 (1994).  The First Congress did not make clear whether that decision—to grant\nthe President plenary removal authority over the Secretary of Foreign Affairs—derived from the \nConstitution or rather was granted by Congress’s own prerogative.  See Myers, 272 U.S. at 285 \nn.75 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lessig & Sunstein, 94 COLUM. L. REV. at 26-28; Seila L., 591\nU.S. at 271 (Kagan, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (“The summer of 1789 thus \nended without resolution of the critical question: Was the removal power ‘beyond the reach of \ncongressional regulation’?” (quoting Saikrishna Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91 \nCORNELL L.REV. 1021, 1072 (2006))).  Some clarity in the First Congress’s view may be \ngleaned, however, by the disparate approach that the Congress took with respect to the \nDepartment of the Treasury.  Seeing the Treasury as a department less intrinsically tied to core\nexecutive powers enumerated in Article II like that over foreign policy, Congress gave far more \ndirection to the structure of that department, specifying in detail its offices and functions and \ngranting independence from unfettered presidential removal power to the Comptroller.  See \nLessig & Sunstein, supra,at 27-28. In short, the executive branch was not treated as strictly \n14 The statute regarding removal of the postmasters read: “Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes \nshall be appointed and may be removed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall \nhold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law.”  Myers, 272 U.S. at 107.   \n23\n\n164a\nunitary, but rather as a branch with units of varying degrees of independence and generally \nsubject to congressional direction through checks and balances—including on its personnel.  See \nJohn F. Manning, Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation, 124 HARV.L.REV. 1939, \n1964 n.135 (2011). \nChief Justice Taft in Myers cherry-pickedonly one portion of that 1789 story by \nhighlighting what the First Congress did with the Department of Foreign Affairs.

Despite the structure of the \nPost Office far more closely resembling the Treasury Department of 1789 than the Department \nof Foreign Affairs, Chief Justice Taft ignored the actual nuances reflected in the Decision of \n1789 as to congressional power to condition the President’s removal power reflected in the \ntreatment of the new Treasury Department and instead read this history “through executive-\ncolored glasses” to support “his strong preconceptions” as former President “about presidential \nremoval power,” to reach the conclusion that a regional postmaster could not be subject to \nremoval protections.

United States, 45J.SUP.CT.HIST.167, 172& n.56(2020)(first \npassage quoting Hayden Smith to William H. Taft (Sep. 1, 1925) (Taft Papers)); Myers, 272 U.S. \nat 176; Lessig & Sunstein, supra, at 25-30.15  Dicta in the lengthy Myers majority opinion made \nbroad pronouncements about the importance of the presidential removal power that were both \ncontradictory and inapposite: While Chief Justice Taft promoted the benefits of recognizing vast \n15 Notably, Chief Justice Taft reached this conclusion over three dissents, including from Justices Holmes and \nBrandeis.  Myers, 272 U.S. at 178-295.  Justice Brandeis, in particular, espoused a view of checks and balances that \nemphasized the interdependence of the executive and legislative branches, vindicated in Justice Jackson’s \nconcurring opinion in Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 634.  See Myers, 272 U.S. at 240-95.  \n24\n\n165a\npresidential removal authority on one hand, herecognized that Congress could legislate around \nappointment and removal of principal officers, in some circumstances, and inferior officers,\nrefusingto threaten protections for the civil service, on the other.  Id. at 127, 134-35, 161-62, \n183, 186 (“[T]here may be duties of a quasi judicial character imposed on executive officers and \nmembers of executive tribunals whose decisions after hearing affect interests of individuals, the \ndischarge of which the President cannot in a particular case properly influence or control. . . . \n[Moreover,] [the appointments clause] give[s] to Congress the power to limit and regulate \nremoval of such inferior officers by heads of departments when it exercises its constitutional \npower to lodge the power of appointment with them.”).16   \nOnly nine years later, in Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court—consisting of six of \nthe same justices who participated in the Myers decision (i.e., Justices Sutherland, Van Devanter, \nBrandeis, Stone, McReynolds, and Butler)—unanimously retreated, denouncing the idea of \n“illimitable” removal authority and disavowingMyers’ abundant dicta.  Morrison, 487 U.S. at\n687 (“In Humphrey’s Executor, we found it ‘plain’ that the Constitution did not give the \nPresident ‘illimitable power of removal’ over the officers of independent agencies.” (quoting 292 \nU.S. at 629)).  Justice Sutherland, who authored Humphrey’s despite joining themajority opinion \nin Myers, limited Myers to “the narrow point” that “the President had power to remove a \npostmaster of the first class, without the advice and consent of the Senate as required by act of \nCongress”and wrote that other “expressions . . . are beyond the point involved and therefore do \nnot come within the rule of stare decisis.  In so far as they are out of harmony with the views \nhere set forth, these expressions are disapproved.” Humphrey’s Ex’r, 292 U.S. at 626-27.  \n16 The bold position taken by the current administration, see Exec. Order No. 14215, 90 Fed. Reg. 10447 \n(2025), that the President has supreme control over all of his subordinates threatens to upend limits on the removal \npower over inferior officers, expressly acknowledged in Myers.   \n25\n\n166a\nHumphrey’s Executor, consistent with thedissents in Myers, did not foreclose that the President \nmay have total authority over removal of some officials (like “high political officers,”Myers, \n272 U.S. at 241 (Brandeis, J., dissenting)), but it made clear that his removal authority may \ncertainly be limited by Congress in other circumstances.17 Humphrey’s Ex’r, 292 U.S. at 629-\n32. \nThe takeaway from Myers is therefore discrete and uncontroversial: While Congress may \nstructure executive branch offices via statute and legislate about the roles of executive branch \nofficers, including standards for their removal, Congress cannot reserve for itself an active role in \nthe removal decision.  The problem in Myers was that the statute required Senate advice and \nconsent to remove postmasters and that encroached on the presidential power of removal.  272 \nU.S. at 107.  It cannot be gainsaid that the President has the power of removal of executive \nbranch officers.  When Congress has statutorily provided a for-cause removal requirement,this \nmeans that the President has the authority to determine whether the for-cause requirement \n17 Justice Brandeis’s dissent in Myers was not so broad as to authorize Congress to restrict presidential \nauthority over removal of anyone in the executive branch.  See Myers, 272 U.S. at 240-42 (Brandise, J., dissenting).  \nRather, he focused on the fact that the postmaster was an inferior officer, very unlike that of the Secretary of Foreign \nAffairs, and the mischief that would result if the majority decision were read to endorse absolute presidential \nremoval authority for all officials.  Id. at 241, 247, 257 (“Power to remove, as well as to suspend, a high political \nofficer, might conceivably be deemed indispensable to democratic government and, hence, inherent in the President. \nBut power to remove an inferior administrative officer appointed for a fixed term cannot conceivably be deemed an \nessential of government.”); see also id. at 181-82, 187, 193 (McReynolds, dissenting) (resisting Myers’ overbroad \ndicta suggesting that all executive officers must serve at the pleasure of the President).  In the dissenters’ views, a \nfunctional analysis into an office’s role and responsibilities—like that in Humphrey’s Executor—was necessary, but \nonly for principal officers.   \nIn the face of the current administration’s push for a more absolutist presidential removal power, history \nprovides significant cautions: Protections for inferior federal officers came about to counter the extensive “spoils \nsystem” that characterized the executive branch in the early 1800s—particularly during the presidency of Andrew \nJackson, whose controversial legacy is due in part to his association with widespread corruption.   See Myers, 272 \nU.S. at 276-83 (McReynolds, J., dissenting); id. at 272 U.S. at 250-52 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  Congress having a \nhand in executive appointments and removal was seen as an antidote to corruption.  Such provisions set the stage for \nthe development of the modern civil service system.  See id.; Katherine Shaw, Partisanship Creep, 118 NW.UNIV.\nL.REV.1563, 1573 & n. 48 (“[A] few decades after Andrew Jackson's administration, strong discontent with\nthe corruption and inefficiency of the patronage system of public employment eventuated in the Pendleton Act, the\nfoundation of modern civil service.” (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 354 (1976))).\n26\n\n167a\nprescribed by Congress has been met.  As the Supreme Court has since repeatedly articulated, \n“the essence” of “Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents Congress from \ndraw[ing] to itself the” power to remove.  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 686 (citing Bowsher v. Synar, \n478 U.S. 714 (1986), for that interpretation).  That holding is completely compatible with \nHumphrey’s Executor.  Little more can be gleaned from the unreliable historical retelling and \nprolix Myers majority opinion.18   \nIn short, neither the Founding-era history nor Myers can carry the heavy weight that the \ncurrent President has thrust upon it.  See Letter from Acting SG (“In Myers . . ., the Supreme \nCourt recognized that Article II of the Constitution gives the President an ‘unrestricted’ power of \n‘removing executive officers.’”).  Neither supports the view that the President’s removal power \nis “illimitable.” Whatever the benefits of unrestricted removal authority under certain \ncircumstances, “[t]he Framers did not constitutionalize presidential control over all that is now \nconsidered ‘executive’; they did not believe that the President must have plenary power over all \nwe now think of as administration,” Lessig & Sunstein, supra, at 118, and neither did the early \ntwentieth century Supreme Court.  \n18 At the motions hearing, defense counsel argued that this interpretation of both Myersand Humphrey’s\nExecutor had been rejected by the Supreme Court in Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 228.  Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), \nRough Tr. at 62:1-17.  That is not so.  In Seila Law, amicus had distilled the Court’s precedent as follows:  \nHumphrey’s Executor and Morrison establish a general rule that Congress may impose “modest” \nrestrictions on the President’s removal power, with only two limited exceptions. . . . Congress may \nnot reserve a role for itself in individual removal decisions (as it attempted to do in Myers and \nBowsher). And it may not eliminate the President’s removal power altogether (as it effectively did \nin Free Enterprise Fund). Outside those two situations, amicus argues, Congress is generally free \nto constrain the President's removal power. \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 228 (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted).  Rather than reject that reconciliation of \nMyers and Humphrey’s Executor, the Court simply restated the principle, uncontroverted in either precedent, that \n“the President’s removal power is the rule, not the exception,” id., and then declined to revisit these precedents or to \n“elevate [Humphrey’s Executor] into a freestanding invitation for Congress to impose additional restrictions on the \nPresident’s removal authority,” id.  In other words, the Supreme Court neither constrained Humphrey’s Executor by \nexpanding Myers beyond its holding nor endorsed an expansion of Humphrey’s Executor itself.  In short, Seila Law, \non this matter, had frankly little to add. \n27\n\n168a\nThe holding in Humphrey’s Executor,that Congress could create boards or commissions\nwith elements of independence from the President, was therefore not at all a “fiction”or an \naberration,as defendants have supposed.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 9.19 Humphrey’s Executor, and thus \nNLRB Board members’ removal protections, are consistent with the text and historical \nunderstandings of Article II, as well as the Supreme Court’s most recent pronouncements.  That \nCongress can exert a check on the President by imposing for-cause restrictions on the removal of \nleaders of multimember boards or commissions is a stalwart principle in our separation of \npowers jurisprudence.   \nc. Humphrey’s Executor Remains Binding.\nIn any case, Humphrey’s Executor remains binding on this Court, as defendants rightly \nacknowledge.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 n.2; Illumina, 88 F.4th at 1047 (“[T]he question of whether \n. . . Humphrey’s Executor [is] no longer binding” is for the Supreme Court alone to answer.).  As \nthe Supreme Court has made clear, “[i]f a precedent . . . has direct application in a case, yet \nappears to rely on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,” the lower courts should still \n“leav[e] to the [Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”  Rodriguez de \nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989); see also Nat’l Sec. Archive v. \nCIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“This court is charged with following case law \nthat directly controls a particular issue, ‘leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of \noverruling its own decisions.’” (alterations in original) (quoting Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., \n19 Nor can Humphrey’s Executor be fairly described as an “exception[]” to the general rule of presidential \nremoval authority.  Contra Seila L., 591 U.S. at 198.  As explained, a careful reading of the history and the scope of \nthe dispute in Myers confirms that Humphrey’s Executor was not some exception to an otherwise absolute \npresidential removal power previously established in Myers.  To the extent Myers extolled such an absolute \npresidential removal power in overbroad dicta, it was in short order rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court.  Myers \nsimply established that the President alone may exercise removal authority over principal officers, and Humphrey’s \nExecutor explained that Congress can set standards, without conferring the exercise of that power to itself, to cabin \nthe President’s singular exercise of that authority in the circumstances presented.   \n28\n\n169a\n600 U.S. 122, 136 (2023))); Meta Platforms, 723 F. Supp. 3d at 87 (“It is certainly not this \nCourt’s place to deem a long-standing Supreme Court precedent obsolete . . . and thus no longer \nbinding.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  This Court would be bound to \nconclude that plaintiff’s termination was unlawful even were the conclusion reached—and this \nCourt adamantly has not—that Humphrey’s Executor was, by today’s measure, ill-reasoned or \nwrongly decided.   \nB. Plaintiff is Entitled to Permanent Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.\nFor all of these reasons, plaintiff prevails on the merits and is therefore entitled to a \ndeclaratory ruling that she was unlawfully terminated from her position as a member of the \nBoard.  Defendants concede as much.  Motions H’rg (Mar. 5, 2025), Rough Tr. at 71:23-72:1 \n(defense counsel stating, “We are not fighting this requested declaratory judgment.”).\nPlaintiff further requests injunctive relief against Mr. Kaplan, ordering him to allow \nplaintiff to carry out all of her duties.  Compl. at 7.  To demonstrate that injunctive relief is \nwarranted, a plaintiff must show that (1) she has suffered an irreparable injury, (2) remedies \navailable at law are inadequate to compensate, (3) a remedy in equity is warranted considering \nthe balance of the hardships to each party, and (4) the public interest is not disserved.  eBay Inc. \nv.MercExchange LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).  Notwithstanding plaintiff’s success on the\nmerits, defendants contest her entitlement to injunctive relief.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 10. \n1. Plaintiff’s Irreparable Harm and Inadequate Remedies at Law\nPlaintiff is suffering irreparable harm that cannot be repairedin the absence of an \ninjunction.20 Courts have recognized as irreparable harms the “unlawful removal from office by \nthe President” and “the obviously disruptive effect” that such removal has on the organization’s \n20 These two factors are often considered together.  See, e.g., Ridgley v. Lew, 55 F. Supp. 3d 89, 98 (D.D.C. \n2014); Dellinger v. Bessent, --F. Supp. 3d--, No. 25-cv-385 (ABJ), 2025 WL 665041, at *32 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 2025). \n29\n\n170a\nfunctioning.  Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-cv-3182, 1983 WL 538, at * 5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), \nvacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (Mem.) (D.C. Cir. 1983). In Berry,terminated members of the \nCivil Rights Commission challenged President Reagan’s decision to remove them.  Id. at *1.  \nThe Commissionwas “left without a quorum,” and the court recognized as an irreparable injury \nboth the commission’s inability to “fulfill its mandate” and the individuals’ inability to serve \n“Congress in the furtherance of civil rights.” Id. at *5. Likewise here, plaintiff has been \ndeprived of a presidentially appointed and congressionally confirmed position of high \nimportance, and both she and, by consequence, the NLRB have been deprived of the ability to \ncarry out their congressional mandate in protecting labor rights—which cannot be retroactively \ncured by monetary damages.  See id.; Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-385 (ABJ), 2025 WL \n471022, at *11-13 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025) (“[T]he loss of the ability to do what Congress \nspecifically directed [her] to do cannot be remediated with anything other than equitable relief.”); \nHarris v. Bessent, --F. Supp.3d--, No. 25-cv-412 (RC), 2025 WL 521027, at *7 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, \n2025) (“By vindicating [her] right to occupy th[at] office, th[is] plaintiff[] act[s] as much in [her] \nown interests as those of [her] agenc[y’s]. . . .  Striking at the independence of these officials \naccrues harm to their offices, as well.”).21\nFurthermore, plaintiff and the NLRB suffer an injury due to the loss of the office’s \nindependence.  As an entity entrusted with making impartial decisions about sensitive labor \n21 Defendants argue that because President Trump could restore the NLRB’s quorum by appointing members \nto fill the vacant seats, the harm here is not irreparable.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 14.  While filling the open seats would halt \nthe ongoing harm and prevent future harm, restoration of the NLRB’s quorum would not do anything to repair the \npast harm—the backlog of cases, the months employers and employees have spent waiting for adjudications, the \npractical ramifications felt across the country (from workers’ rights violations to workplace unrest) of labor disputes \nleft unresolved, delayed union recognition, and so forth.  The possibility that the NLRB could once again operate \nmay be one difference between this case and the situation of the Civil Rights Commission in Berry, where the \nCommission was set to expire before it could fulfill its statutory mandate, see 1983 WL 538, at *5, but that \npossibility does not make the harm here somehow reparable.  The NLRB’s statutory mandate is not to—at some \npoint in time—operate, contrary to defendants’ suggestion, Defs.’ Opp’n at 14-15, but rather to have an ongoing, \nefficient administration of the country’s labor laws.      \n30\n\n171a\ndisputes, the NLRB’s character and perception as neutral and expert-driven is damaged by \nplaintiff’s unlawful removal.  See Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 U.S. at 630 (“[The] coercive influence \n[of the removal power] threatens the independence of a commission.”); Harris, 2025 WL \n679303, at *13 (“[T]he MSPB's independence would evaporate if the President could terminate \nits members without cause, even if a court could later order them reinstated.”).  Money likewise \ncannot make up for that kind of intangible and reputational harm.   \nDefendants argue that, regardless of the injury, plaintiff’s requested remedy—\nreinstatement to her position—is one the Court cannot grant.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 11.  Not only have \nall previous cases sought back pay instead of reinstatement, defendants point out, but also \nreinstatement is not a remedy historically available at equity, which constrains the relief \navailable to the Court today.  Id. at 12 (citing Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond \nFund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999)).  Plaintiff counters, however, that she does not request the \nremedy of “reappointment” and does not need to be reinstated: She requests only a declaration \nthat the President lacked authority to remove her—making the termination email void ab initio—\nand injunctive relief to enable her to carry out her position as before.  See Pl.’s Reply at 9.   \nDefendants do not challenge the Court’s ability to afford declaratory relief, but they do \nchallenge an injunction running against the executive branch, even against the President’s \nsubordinates, to permit plaintiff to carry out her duties.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 11, 13.  They contend \nthat such relief would effectively “compel[]” the President “to retain the services of a principal \nofficer whom he no longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise of executive power.”  \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 11; see also Defs.’ Reply at 7-8.  At most, however, this argument simply \nrestates defendants’ position on the merits, because, as a general matter, courts undoubtedly have \nauthority to constrain unlawful presidential action by enjoining the President’s subordinates.  \n31\n\n172a\nSee, e.g., Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 582, 589 (holding a presidential act unconstitutional and \naffirming the district court judgment which restrained Secretary of Commerce); Chamber of \nCom. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“[I]t is now well established that ‘[r]eview \nof the legality of Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a suit seeking to enjoin the \nofficers who attempt to enforce the President's directive.’  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. \n788, 815 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  Even if the \nSecretary were acting at the behest of the President, this ‘does not leave the courts without power \nto review the legality [of the action], for courts have power to compel subordinate executive \nofficials to disobey illegal Presidential commands.’  Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067, 1072 n. 12 \n(D.C. Cir. 1971).” (alterations in original)); Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL \n559669, at *6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (noting that a court “can unquestionably review the \nlegality of the President’s action by enjoining the officers who would attempt to enforce the \nPresident’s order”).   \nMoreover, the D.C. Circuit has held such relief is appropriate in this type of employment \ncontext: A court may, by targeting a President’s subordinates, “reinstate a wrongly terminated \nofficial ‘de facto,’ even without a formal presidential reappointment” that would require \ninjunctive relief against the President himself.  Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. \nCir. 2023) (holding that the plaintiff’s injury was therefore redressable); cf. Swanv. Clinton, 100 \nF.3d 973, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (holding that plaintiff’s claim was redressable because injunctive\nrelief against inferior officials, who could de facto reinstate plaintiff by allowing him to exercise \nthe privileges of his office, would remedy plaintiff’s harm); see also Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at \n*10-12 (holding that the court can order such relief to remedy an unlawful termination and\nrelying on Swan and Severino);  Dellinger v. Bessent, --F. Supp. 3d--, No. 25-cv-385 (ABJ), \n32\n\n173a\n2025 WL 665041, at *29-31 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 2025) (same).  TheCourt therefore has the \nauthority to issue both the declaratory and injunctive remedies that plaintiff seeks.22\n2. Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest\nThe balance of the equities and the public interest also favor injunctive relief here.  See \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (noting that, where the government is a party, “[t]hese \ntwo factors merge”).  The public has an interest in efficient and peaceful resolution of labor \nconflicts, and the Board’s functioning is crucial to that goal.  In 2024, the NLRB received 20,000 \nto 30,000 unfair labor practice charges, and the Board reviewed 144 unfair labor practice cases \n22 Defendants’ arguments that plaintiff may not be “reinstated” or “reappointed” because reinstatement was \nnot a remedy originally available at equity are not only inconsequential because relief need not be fashioned in that \nform, as described above, but they are also flawed.  Defendants’ argument ultimately boils down to a technical \ndistinction: Historically, requests for reinstatement were styled as writs of mandamus or quo warranto before courts \nof law instead of requests for injunctions before courts of equity, as defendants’ cited cases reflect.  Defs.’ Opp’n at \n12; Twenty States’ Amicus Br. at 3; see In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888) (noting that while a court of equity \ndoes not have “jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers, . . . the courts of law, . . . either by \ncertiorari, error, or appeal, or by mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo \nwarranto” do); White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (same).  After the merger of law and equity in the federal \ncourts over eighty years ago, however, that distinction makes no difference and does not render improper the \ninjunctive relief plaintiff requests.   \nUnsurprisingly, many courts have, therefore, reinstated federal employees to their positions or prevented \ntheir removals from taking effect.  See, e.g., Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 546 (1959) (“[P]etitioner is entitled to \nthe reinstatement which he seeks.”); Pelicone v. Hodges, 320 F.2d 754, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1963) (holding that plaintiff \nwas “entitled to reinstatement”); Paroczay v. Hodges, 219 F. Supp. 89, 94 (D.D.C. 1963) (holding that, because \nplaintiff “was never legally separated,” the court “will therefore order plaintiff’s reinstatement”); Berry, 1983 WL \n538, at *6 (enjoining removal of members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights); cf. Sampson v. Murray, 415 \nU.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974) (acknowledging that “[u]se of the court’s injunctive power” may be appropriate in certain \ncases regarding discharge of employees).  The other cases cited by defendants for the principle that reinstatement is \nnot available as equitable relief, Defs.’ Opp’n at 12, involve the unique situation of federal courts presiding over \nquestions about state officers’ entitlement to their positions, which is wholly inapplicable here.  See Baker v. Carr, \n369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962) (citing cases about “enjoin[ing] a state proceeding to remove a public officer”); Walton v. \nHouse of Representatives of Okla., 265 U.S. 487, 489-90 (1924) (holding that the district court did not have \n“jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of state officers”); Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 165-70 \n(1898) (declining to enjoin a state criminal proceeding); see also Twenty States’ Amicus Br. at 16-17 (making the \ninapposite argument that imposing a remedy of reinstatement of state officers invades state sovereignty).   \nIn any case, the D.C. Circuit has “note[d] that a request for an injunction based on the general federal \nquestion statute is essentially a request for a writ of mandamus in this context, where the injunction is sought to \ncompel federal officials to perform a statutorily required ministerial duty.”  Swan, 100 F.3d at 976 n.1.  Indeed, \nplaintiff made a last-minute request in her Notice of Supplemental Authority, ECF No. 33 at 4, for a writ of \nmandamus in the alternative.  A writ of mandamus requires that “(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the \ndefendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the plaintiff.”  Id. at 4 n.1 \n(alteration accepted) (quoting In re Nat’l Nurses United, 47 F.4th 746, 752 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted)).  \nAccordingly, if injunctive relief were not available here because of adherence to the historical dividing lines of law \nand equity, a writ of mandamus would likely be available, and the effective relief provided to plaintiff would be the \nsame.  See Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *11.   \n33\n\n174a\nand 115 election certification cases.  See Nineteen States & D.C.’s Br.at 7, ECF No. 31 (citing \nNLRB, Investigate Charges,https://perma.cc/CU82-KU4V; NLRB, Board Decisions Issued, \nhttps:www.nlrb.gov/reports/agency-performance/board-decisions-issued (last visited Feb. 24, \n2025)).  Without a functioning NLRB, unfair labor practices go unchallenged, union elections go \nunrecognized, and pending labor disputes go unreviewed.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 12 (providing one \nexample where Whole Foods has refused to recognize a union election because it claims the \nNLRB lacks the authority to certify it); Pl.’s Reply at 12 (citing an additional example where \nCVS has refused to recognize a majority elected union).  Incentives to comply with national \nlabor law may be severely undercut if no agency is available for enforcement.  Employees, \nemployers, and bargaining units all suffer as a result.  The public also has an interest in the \nprotection of duly enacted, constitutional laws—like the NLRA—from encroachment from other \nbranches.  See League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“[T]here is a \nsubstantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.’” (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th \nCir. 1994))).  Reinstating plaintiff would allow the NLRB to reach a quorum, thereby allowing \nthe Board to carry out the important work in promoting labor stability, adjudicating labor \ndisputes, and protecting workers’ rights, without inflicting any measurable harm on defendants.23\nDefendants protest that the President will indeed experience harm—by virtue of retaining \n“a principal officer whom the President no longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise \nof executive power,” resulting in the executive branch “slip[ping] from the Executive’s control, \nand thus from that of the people.”  Defs.’ Opp’nat 15 (second passage quoting Free Enter. Fund, \n23 As plaintiff’s supporting state amici point out, a less partisan Board, insulated from at-will removal, is less \nlikely to whipsaw the public by taking completely disparate approaches every four years, which has concomitant \npublic benefits in greater stability and predictability in administration of the law.  See Nineteen States & D.C. Br. at \n9 n.21.   \n34\n\n175a\n561 U.S. at 499). Yet,President Trump can exercise control over the NLRB by appointing two \nmembers of his choosing to the vacant seats and appointing a General Counsel who will adopt \nhis enforcement priorities; he simply has chosen not to do so.  In any case, whether the public \nwill benefit more from the balance Congress has struck in preserving some independence from \npolitical whims in the administration of our national labor laws or from complete executive \ncontrol goes to the core of the constitutional question underlying the merits—and thus the answer \nis dictated by binding precedent.   \nFinally, defendants predict their ultimate success before the Supreme Court, warning that \nif plaintiff is allowed to resume her duties on the Board now, any NLRB decisions in the \nmeantime may be voidable,and “the NLRB will be under a heavy cloud of illegitimacy.”  Defs.’ \nReply at 9; see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 16; Twenty States’ Amicus Br. at 16 (suggesting that \n“reinstatement hampers effective governance” by causing “intra-office ‘chaos’” and questions \nabout the fitness of the official).  The possibility of future changes in the law is not enough, \nhowever, to permit an unlawful termination and the halting of all Board activity in the meantime. \nPlaintiff’s wrongful termination has caused “chaos” enough and shall not be allowed to stand\nbased on defendants’ self-serving speculation.   \nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe President seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power\nin a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of \na presidency that is supreme.  Defendants cite in their briefing Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. \n593, 608-09 (2024)(granting the President absolute and presumptive immunity from criminal \nliability for “official acts”), to argue that the removal power is “conclusive and preclusive,”with \nthe result that the President need not be subject to criminal or civil legislative constraints.  Defs.’ \n35\n\n176a\nReply at 7.  The courts arenow again forced to determine how much encroachment on the \nlegislature our Constitution can bearand face a slippery slope toward endorsing a presidency that \nis untouchable by the law.  The President has given no sufficient reason to accept that path here.\nHumphrey’s Executor and its progeny control the outcome of this case and require that \nplaintiff be permitted to continue her role as Board member of the NLRB and her termination \ndeclared unlawful and void.  The Constitution and caselaw are clear in allowing Congress to \nlimit the President’s removal power and in allowing the courts to enjoin the executive branch \nfrom unlawful action.  Defendants’ hyperbolic characterization that legislative and judicial \nchecks on executive authority,as invoked by plaintiff,present “extraordinary intrusion[s] onthe \nexecutive branch,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 1, is both incorrect and troubling.  Under our constitutional \nsystem, such checks, by design,guard against executive overreachand the risk such overreach \nwould pose of autocracy. SeeMyers, 272 U.S. at 293 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). An American \nPresident is not a king—not even an “elected” one24—and his power to remove federal officers \nand honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate \ncircumstances, as are present here.   \nAn order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered contemporaneously.\nDate:  March 6, 2025\n__________________________\nBERYL A.

INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris was appointed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) \non June 1, 2022, for a term set to expire on March 1, 2028.  Federal law states that members of \nthe MSPB may be removed from office “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice.”  On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump informed Harris that her position on \nthe MSPB was “terminated, effective immediately” but provided no reason for Harris’s \ntermination.  The following day, Harris filed this lawsuit against President Trump and several \nother federal officials (“Defendants”), claiming that her termination violated federal law.  She \nmoved for a temporary restraining order enjoining Defendants from treating her as removed from \noffice, which this Court granted.  The parties consolidated preliminary injunction briefing with \nthe merits, and Harris moved for summary judgment.  The Court grants that motion, along with \ndeclaratory judgment and a permanent injunction. \n\n182a\nII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Statutory Background\nCongress created the Merit Systems Protection Board as a component of the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978 (“CSRA”), which “establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions \ntaken against federal employees.”  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 44 (2012); see also CSRA, \nPub. L. No. 95-454, § 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121–25 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 1201–05).  \nCongress’s Findings and Statement of Purpose indicate that “[i]t is the policy of the United \nStates that . . . to provide the people of the United States with a competent, honest, and \nproductive Federal work force[,] . . . Federal personnel management should be implemented \nconsistent with merit system principles.”  CSRA § 3, 92 Stat. at 1112.  Those merit system \nprinciples include, among others, “[r]ecruitment . . . from qualified individuals” where “selection \nand advancement [is] determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, \nafter fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.”  Id. § 101, 92 \nStat. at 1113 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301).  Congress additionally instructed that “[e]mployees \nshould be . . . protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan \npolitical purposes,” as well as “against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information which the \nemployees reasonably believe evidences,” among other things, violations of law, gross waste of \nfunds, an abuse of authority, or substantial and specific dangers to public health or safety.  Id., 92 \nStat. at 1114 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301). \nThe CSRA established the MSPB as “an independent agency consisting of three \nmembers” and “charged [it] with protecting the merit system principles and adjudicating \nconflicts between federal workers and their employing agencies.”  Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. \nBd., 672 F.2d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see also CSRA § 101, 92 Stat. at 1114–17 (codified at 5 \n2 \n\n183a\nU.S.C. § 2302) (establishing prohibited personnel practices, such as employment discrimination, \nunlawful political activities, and any other violations of law within the federal civil service).  The \nBoard’s primary function is to review federal employee appeals of adverse actions “which [are] \nappealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation,” including those related to removal or \nsuspension for periods greater than fourteen days.  5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); see also id. § 1204(a)(1).  \nThese adjudications consume approximately 95 percent of MSPB members’ time.  See Pl.’s \nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts ¶ 54 (“SUMF”), ECF No. 22-2.  The Board may order \nfederal agencies and employees to comply with its decisions, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2), which \nare nonetheless subject to judicial review.  See id. § 7703.  The MSPB thus acts as a preliminary \nadjudicator of these employment disputes, with federal courts providing the final say if the \nparties so desire. \nThe MSPB carries out other limited tasks in pursuit of its mission.  It conducts studies \n“relating to the civil service” for the President and Congress, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(3), although \nthis function takes up less than one percent of members’ time, see SUMF ¶ 62.  The Board may \nalso review “rules and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management,” see id. § 1204(a)(4), \non its own motion, following a complaint from the Special Counsel, or in response to a third \nparty’s petition, see id. § 1204(f)(1).  The MSPB may invalidate the rule or its implementation if \nit would require a federal employee to engage in prohibited personnel practices.  See id. \n§ 1204(f)(2).1\nMembers of the MSPB are “appointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate,” and “not more than 2 of [the members] may be adherents of the same \n1 Harris explains that invalidation of an Office of Personnel Management rule under this \nmechanism “is an exceedingly rare occurrence” that has not happened during her tenure.  Harris \nDecl. ¶ 31, ECF No. 22-3. \n3 \n\n184a\npolitical party.”  CSRA § 202 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1201).  Members of the MSPB are \nappointed to seven-year terms that may be extended by up to one year if a successor has not yet \nbeen appointed.  Id. (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1202(a)–(c)).  “Any member may be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. (codified at 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202(d)). \nB. Factual and Procedural Background\nPresident Joseph R. Biden nominated Harris to be a member of the MSPB in January \n2022.  SUMF ¶ 1.  The Senate confirmed her on May 25, 2022, and she was sworn in on June 1, \n2022.  Id. ¶ 2.  Her term expires on March 1, 2028.  Id. ¶ 3.  The Senate later confirmed Harris as \nChairman, and she was sworn in as Chairman on March 14, 2024.  Id. ¶¶ 4–5.   \nDefendants do not dispute that Harris has been efficient and effective in her role at the \nMSPB.  See id. ¶ 8.  When the MSPB’s quorum was restored in March 2022, the agency had a \nbacklog of approximately 3,800 cases that had accrued since 2017, and officials estimated that it \nwould take five or six years for the agency to catch up.  Id. ¶¶ 12–14.  By January 2025, \nhowever, the MSPB had cleared nearly 99 percent of its backlog.  Id. ¶ 20.  From June 1, 2022, \nto February 10, 2025, Harris participated in nearly 4,500 decisions.  Id. ¶ 10.   \nOn February 10, 2025, Harris received an email from Trent Morse, Deputy Assistant to \nthe President and the Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, which \nstated in its entirety: \nOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your \nposition on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective \nimmediately. Thank you for your service[.] \nEx. 4 to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and J. on the Merits, ECF No. 22-4.  The communication did \nnot explain the basis for Harris’s termination. \n4 \n\n185a\nHarris filed this lawsuit on February 11, 2025, claiming that her firing was ultra vires, \nunconstitutional, and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  See Compl. \n¶¶ 31–37, 40–41, ECF No. 1.  She seeks relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, issuance of a \nwrit of mandamus, and equitable relief.  See id. ¶¶ 38–39, 42–46.  Harris additionally filed a \nmotion for a temporary restraining order, see Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 2, which Defendants \nopposed, see Defs.’ Opp’n to Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 6.  The Court held a hearing on the TRO \nmotion on February 13, 2025, and granted the motion on February 18, 2025.  See Min. Entry \ndated Feb. 13, 2025; Order Granting Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 8; Mem. Op. Granting Pl.’s \nMot. for TRO (“Mem. Op.”), ECF No. 9.  Defendants appealed that order to the D.C. Circuit, \nand the appeal remains pending.  See Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 15. \nOn February 19, 2025, the parties filed a joint status report indicating that the Court’s \nconsideration of the subsequent motion for preliminary injunction should be consolidated with \nthe merits of the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).  See Joint Status \nReport, ECF No. 13.  On February 23, 2025, Harris filed a motion for a preliminary injunction \nand judgment on the merits.  See Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and J. on the Merits (“Pl.’s Mot.”), \nECF No. 22.  Defendants opposed the motion, see Defs.’ Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and \nJ. on the Merits (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 33, and Harris filed a reply, see Defs.’ Reply, ECF \nNo. 38.  The parties appeared for a hearing before the Court on March 3, 2025. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD\n“Having granted consolidation under Rule 65(a)(2), the Court ‘treats the parties’ briefing \nas cross-motions for summary judgment.’”  Penkoski v. Bowser, 486 F. Supp. 3d 219, 226 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Trump v. Comm. on Oversight & Reform of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, 380 F. Supp. 3d 76, 90 (D.D.C. 2019)).  “The court shall grant summary \n5 \n\n186a\njudgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A dispute is genuine if \n“the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury.”  Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251–52 (1986).  And a fact is material if it “might affect the \noutcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Id. at 248.  On summary judgment, the Court \nviews all evidence “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and . . . must draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.”  Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \nThe principal purpose of summary judgment is to streamline litigation by disposing of \nfactually unsupported claims or defenses and determining whether there is a genuine need for \ntrial.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–24 (1986).  The movant bears the initial \nburden of identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  In response, the non-\nmovant must point to specific facts in the record that reveal a genuine issue that is suitable for \ntrial.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.  In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court must \n“eschew making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence[,]” Czekalski v. Peters, 475 \nF.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and all underlying facts and inferences must be analyzed in the \nlight most favorable to the non-movant, see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.  Nevertheless, \nconclusory assertions offered without any evidentiary support do not establish a genuine issue \nfor trial.  See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).   \nIV.  ANALYSIS\nThe Court first considers the constitutionality of the MSPB’s structure, concluding that \nits members’ for-cause removal protections are constitutional under Humphrey’s Executor.  \n6 \n\n187a\nFederal law thus prevents the President from removing members of the MSPB without cause, \nand the President’s attempt to terminate Harris was unlawful.  As such, Harris is entitled to \nsummary judgment.  The Court next determines the remedies to which Harris may be entitled, \ngranting her declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction.  To the extent that injunctive \nrelief may be unavailable, the Court would grant mandamus relief in the alternative. \nA. Constitutionality of the MSPB Members’ Removal Protections\nHarris claims that her termination was ultra vires in violation of statutory authority, \nviolated the separation of powers, and was contrary to law under the APA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 31–\n37, 40–41.  She argues that this case falls squarely within the heartland of Humphrey’s Executor \nv.United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and its progeny, and that the Board is a traditional\nmultimember body that does not wield traditional executive power.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11–20.  \nMSPB members’ removal protections are therefore constitutional, according to Harris.  See id. at \n11–12.  Defendants respond that the MSPB does not fall within Humphrey’s Executor, and that \nthe independent agency wields substantial executive power.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 5–13.  The \nCourt concludes that MSPB members’ removal protections are constitutional under Humphrey’s \nExecutor and must be upheld here. \nIn Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court upheld a statutory provision identical to the \none at issue here restricting removal of Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) members.  See \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619–20 (discussing 15 U.S.C. § 41); 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).  The \nFTC comprises five members “appointed by the President[,] by and with the advice and consent \nof the Senate,” and “[n]ot more than three of the commissioners shall be members of the same \npolitical party.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619–20 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41).  “Any \nCommissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \n7 \n\n188a\nin office.”  Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41).  In Humphrey’s Executor, President Hoover had \nappointed William Humphrey as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, which carried a \nterm of seven years.  295 U.S. at 612.  Less than two years later, President Roosevelt terminated \nHumphrey over differences of political opinion, stating, “[e]ffective as of this date you are \nhereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.”  Id. at 619.  \nHumphrey died several months later, but his estate sued to recover backpay on the basis that his \nremoval was unlawful.  Id. at 612. \nThe Supreme Court confirmed that President Roosevelt’s termination of Humphrey was \nindeed unlawful.  The Court observed that “[t]he statute fixes a term of office, in accordance \nwith many precedents.”  Id. at 623.  The Court further explained that the commission comprised \na “nonpartisan” “body of experts” that was intended to “act with entire impartiality.”  Id. at 624.  \nIt was “charged with the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law” and acted in a \nmanner that was “predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative” rather than traditionally \n“political []or executive” in nature.  Id.  The Court differentiated FTC members from the \npostmaster in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) (evaluating statute stating that \npostmasters “shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended \naccording to law”).  “A postmaster is an executive officer restricted to the performance of \nexecutive functions” and is “charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial \npower.”  Id. at 627.  The FTC, in contrast, “acts in part quasi legislatively and in part quasi \njudicially” rather than exercising traditional executive powers.  Id. at 628.  “We think it plain \nunder the Constitution that illimitable power of removal is not possessed by the President in \nrespect of officers of the character of those just named,” the Court concluded.  Id. at 629.  \n8 \n\n189a\nTwo decades later, the Court considered President Eisenhower’s removal of a member of \nthe War Claims Commission, whom President Truman had appointed and the Senate had \nconfirmed.  See Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958).  Congress charged that \ncommission with processing “claims for compensating internees, prisoners of war, and religious \norganizations . . . who suffered personal injury or property damage at the hands of the enemy in \nconnection with World War II,” and the commissioners’ terms were limited by the short duration \nof the commission’s existence.  Id.  The Court reasoned that Congress intended to “preclude[] \nthe President from influencing the Commission in passing on a particular claim,” which meant \nthat the President naturally could not “hang . . . the Damocles’ sword of removal” over the \ncommissioners.  Id. at 356.  The Court reaffirmed that the President had “no such power” to \n“remove a member of an adjudicatory body like the War Claims Commission merely because he \nwanted his own appointees on such a Commission.”  Id.2 \nIn two more recent cases, however, the Supreme Court ruled that for-cause removal \nprovisions applying to independent agencies with a single director violated the separation of \npowers.  See Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 218 \n(2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021).  Neither of those cases undermines the \n2 The Court once again considered a multimember body in Mistretta v. United States \nwhen passing on the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing Commission, which \nformally resides in the Judiciary.  488 U.S. 361 (1989).  The Sentencing Report Act of 1984 \nempowered the President to appoint commissioners to the Sentencing Commission, with \nmembers “subject to removal by the President ‘only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \nor for other good cause shown.’”  Id. at 368 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 991(a)).  When considering \nwhether the Act affords the President undue influence over federal judges who served as \ncommissioners, the Court recognized that “the President’s removal power under the Act is \nlimited.”  Id. at 410.  “Such congressional limitation on the President’s removal power, like the \nremoval provisions upheld in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and Humphrey’s Executor \n. . . , is specifically crafted to prevent the President from exercising ‘coercive influence’ over \nindependent agencies.”  Id. at 410–411. \n9 \n\n190a\nconstitutionality of for-cause removal provisions for multimember bodies of experts heading an \nindependent agency.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 228 (“[W]e do not revisit Humphrey’s Executor \nor any other precedent today.”). \n“Rather than create a traditional independent agency headed by a multimember board or \ncommission, Congress elected to place the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”)] \nunder the leadership of a single Director.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207.  In Seila Law, the Court \nobserved that “[a]n agency with a structure like that of the CFPB is almost wholly \nunprecedented.”  Id. as 220; see also id. at 220–22 (searching for historical precedent to support \nthe CFPB’s structure).  The Court further concluded that “[t]he CFPB’s single-Director \nstructure” contravenes the separation of powers “by vesting significant governmental power in \nthe hands of a single individual accountable to no one,” emphasizing that the director may act \n“unilaterally” and “[w]ith no colleagues to persuade.”  Id. at 224–25.  Two other features of the \nCFPB undermined the constitutionality of the agency’s structure.  First, the director’s five-year \nterm meant that “some Presidents may not have any opportunity to shape [the agency’s] \nleadership and thereby influence its activities.”  Id. at 225.  Second, “[t]he CFPB’s receipt of \nfunds outside the appropriations process further aggravates the agency’s threat to Presidential \ncontrol.”  Id. at 226.  For these reasons, the Court concluded that the CFPB’s structure violated \nthe separation of powers.  See id. at 232.   \nNone of the reasoning in Seila Law undermined the constitutionality of the traditional \nindependent agency structure outlined in Humphrey’s Executor.  See id. at 218 (describing \n“exception[]” for “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power”).  \nRather, the Court’s reasoning reaffirmed the constitutionality of multimember boards with for-\ncause removal protections, as those agencies have a robust basis in this country’s history, and \n10 \n\n191a\ntheir members lack the power to act unilaterally.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11 (emphasizing that \nCongress established the first such board in 1887).  The Court’s rationale also relied on the \nCFPB’s divergence from traditional agency structures when finding the for-cause removal \nprotections unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 205–07 (emphasizing facts \nshowing drift from Elizabeth Warren’s initial proposal for multimember board to Congress’s \nenactment of single-headed agency).  The Court even opined that Congress could fix the problem \nby “for example, converting the CFPB into a multimember agency.”  Id. at 237. \nCollins then represented a “straightforward application” of the Court’s “reasoning in \nSeila Law” to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”).  594 U.S. at 251; see also Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 222 (noting doubt as to the constitutionality of the FHFA’s structure).  \nSimilarly to the CFPB, the FHFA was “an agency led by a single Director” that “lack[ed] a \nfoundation in historical practice and clashe[d] with constitutional structure by concentrating \npower in a unilateral actor insulated from Presidential control.”  594 U.S. at 251. \nHumphrey’s Executor thus remains alive and well, and it dictates the outcome here.  The \nMSPB is “a traditional independent agency headed by a multimember board or commission,” \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 207, and as such Congress may grant the Board’s members for-cause \nremoval protections.  The MSPB is “a multimember body of experts” that is “balanced along \npartisan lines.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216; see also Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624 \n(noting that the FTC is a “nonpartisan” “body of experts” that was intended to “act with entire \nimpartiality”).  The CSRA envisions that the Board “is to be nonpartisan; and it must, from the \nvery nature of its duties, act with entire impartiality.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.  \nThe CSRA also “fixes a term of office.”  Id. at 623.  The Board’s members serve on overlapping, \nstaggered seven-year terms, meaning that the President will have the “opportunity to shape [the \n11 \n\n192a\nMSPB’s] leadership and thereby influence its activities.” 3  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  The \nmembers’ staggered terms permit them to “accumulate[] expertise” in the operation of federal \nagencies and federal employment law.  Id. at 218.  The MSPB’s duties are “quasi judicial,” \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624, in that it conducts preliminary adjudications of federal \nemployees’ claims, which may then be appealed to Article III courts.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703 \n(providing for review in the Federal Circuit); Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 582 U.S. 420, 423 \n(2017) (providing for review of mixed cases in district court).  The MSPB’s rulemaking \nauthority is limited to “regulations . . . necessary for the performance of its functions.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(h).  Congress further intended the agency to aid its legislative goals by regularly \ntransmitting reports to Congress regarding the Board’s functions.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(l), 1205.  \nIt is additionally evident that Congress hoped to “preclude[] the President from influencing the \n[Board] in passing on a particular claim.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  The MSPB nonetheless \nremains politically accountable to both Congress and the President through the appropriations \nprocess in a manner inapplicable to independent agencies with their own funding sources, such \nas the CFPB and FHFA.  See Selia Law, 591 U.S. at 226; Collins, 594 U.S. at 231. \nThe MSPB also “do[es] not wield substantial executive power,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n218, but rather spends nearly all of its time adjudicating “inward-facing personnel matters” \ninvolving federal employees, Pl.’s Mot. at 4.  The Board does not regulate the conduct of private \nparties, nor does it possess its own rulemaking authority except in furtherance of its judicial \nfunctions.  See id. at 12.  It cannot initiate its own personnel cases, but must instead “passively \n3 One MSPB member’s term has now expired, and Harris’s term expires on March 1, \n2028.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 29 n.20; Pl.’s Reply at 13–14; SUMF ¶ 3.  President Trump will \ntherefore have the opportunity to appoint at least two members to the MSPB during his term in \noffice. \n12 \n\n193a\nwait for them to be brought.”  Id. at 12; see also 5 U.S.C. § 1204 (defining the Board’s powers \nand functions).  Harris additionally points out that the MSPB preserves power within the \nexecutive branch by charging presidentially appointed Board members with mediation and initial \nadjudication of federal employment disputes, rather than shifting those decisions to Article III \ncourts in the first instance.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 14.   \nSeveral other features of the MSPB demonstrate its limited effects on the President’s \npowers.  The MSPB’s jurisdiction is generally restricted to civil servants and does not include \npolitical appointees.4  See 5 U.S.C. § 7511.  Even among civil servants, members of the Senior \nExecutive Service removed “for less than fully successful executive performance” are entitled \nonly to an informal hearing before the Board.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3592(a).  Furthermore, the MSPB’s \ndecisions are generally not the final word.  Federal employees may appeal the Board’s decisions \nto Article III courts, see 5 U.S.C. § 7703(a), and the Director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement may similarly seek review of any decision that he determines “will have a \nsubstantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive,” id. § 7703(d)(1)–\n(2).   \nFinally, the MSPB’s mission and purpose require independence.  In enacting the CSRA, \nCongress exercised its power to regulate the civil service, defining certain prohibited personnel \npractices, to include discrimination, loyalty oaths, coercion to engage in political activity, and \nretaliation against whistleblowers.  See 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1)–(3), (8).  Direct political control \nover the MSPB would have limited effect on the President’s implementation of his policy \nagenda.  It would instead neuter the CSRA’s statutory scheme by allowing high-ranking \n4 Nor may the Board review the merits of determinations concerning an employee’s \neligibility to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security.  See Kaplan v. \nConyers, 733 F.3d 1148, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2013).   \n13 \n\n194a\ngovernment officials to engage in prohibited practices and then pressure the MSPB into inaction.  \nThe MSPB’s independence is therefore structurally inseparable from the CSRA itself.  These \nduties dovetail with United States v. Perkins, in which the Supreme Court held that Congress \nmay “limit, restrict, and regulate the removal” of inferior officers.  116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886).  \nDenying independence to the Board would undermine these constitutionally sound limitations on \nthe removal of civil servants. \nDefendants cannot argue that Humphrey’s Executor has been overturned, so they instead \nsuggest that even if the MSPB is a traditional multimember agency, it wields “‘substantial’ \nexecutive power” in a manner found significant in Seila Law.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 (quoting Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 218).  Yet the Supreme Court has clarified that it did not mean Humphrey’s \nExecutor to exclude removal protections for any official exercising authority within the \nexecutive branch.  See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 688–89 (1988); see also Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 216 (detailing “several organizational features that helped explain” the Humphrey’s \nExecutor court’s “characterization of the FTC as non-executive”).  There is instead a “spectrum” \nthat runs from “‘purely executive’ officials who must be removable by the President at will if he \nis to be able to accomplish his constitutional role” and those who serve “‘quasi-legislative’ or \n‘quasi-judicial’” roles, where the President’s control is not “so central to the functioning of the \nExecutive Branch” as to require the President to be able to terminate the official at will.  \nMorrison, 487 U.S. at 690–91.  As the Court explained above, the Board’s duties—which \nprimarily include adjudication of employment claims—do not represent “substantial” executive \npower and instead take on a quasi-judicial role.  Furthermore, the MSPB’s powers are no more \nexpansive than the FTC’s functions upheld in Humphrey’s Executor, which remains good law.  \n14 \n\n195a\nSeveral courts have deployed similar reasoning when rejecting challenges to the \nstructures of traditional multimember agencies in the years since Seila Law and Collins.  Last \nyear, the Fifth Circuit upheld the structure of the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n(“CPSC”), concluding that the agency is “a prototypical ‘traditional independent agency, run by \na multimember board,’” is not directed by a single individual, and that the President may \ninfluence its activities through appointments or the appropriations process.  Consumers’ Rsch. v. \nConsumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 91 F.4th 342, 354–55 (5th Cir. 2024), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct. \n414, 170 (2024).  The Tenth Circuit turned away a comparable challenge to the agency, \nreasoning that Humphrey’s Executor remains good law, that the CPSC is structured similarly to \nthe FTC, and that limited civil and criminal enforcement powers do not undermine the \nconstitutionality of its tenure protections.  Leachco, Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 103 \nF.4th 748, 762 (10th Cir. 2024), cert. denied, No. 24-156, 2025 WL 76435 (U.S. Jan. 13, 2025). \nCourts have additionally found the FTC’s structure constitutionally sound because the Supreme \nCourt has not revisited Humphrey’s Executor.  See Illumina, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 88 \nF.4th 1036, 1047 (5th Cir. 2023); Meta Platforms, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 723 F. Supp. 3d \n64, 87 (D.D.C. 2024).  This Court, likewise, cannot reach a different outcome regarding the \nMSPB. \nBecause the MSPB falls within the scope of Humphrey’s Executor, Congress has the \npower to specify that members of the MSPB may serve for a term of years, with the President \nempowered to remove those members only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice.  The President thus lacks the power to remove Harris from office at will.  Because the \nPresident did not indicate that he sought to remove Harris for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \n15 \n\n196a\nmalfeasance in office, his attempt to terminate her was unlawful and exceeded the scope of his \nauthority.5 \nB. Remedy\nWith the merits aside, the Court turns to the question of remedy.  Harris offers up three \navenues for relief: declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and a writ of mandamus.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 38–39, 42–44, 45–46; Pl.’s Mot. at 27–36.  The Court concludes that because any \nattempt to remove Harris is unlawful, she is entitled to declaratory judgment that she remains a \nproperly appointed member of the MSPB.  The Court additionally determines that Harris has met \nher burden for the permanent injunction she seeks, and that a writ of mandamus would be \nappropriate if such injunctive relief were unavailable. \n1. Declaratory Judgment\nThe Declaratory Judgment Act provides that, “[i]n a case of actual controversy within its \njurisdiction . . . any court of the United States . . . may declare the rights and other legal relations \nof any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be \nsought.”  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).  It provides neither jurisdiction nor a cause of action, but rather a \nform of relief when the case is already properly before the Court.  See C&E Servs., Inc. of \nWashington v. D.C. Water & Sewer Autho., 310 F.3d 197, 201 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Glenn v. \nThomas Fortune Fay, 222 F. Supp. 3d 31, 35 (D.D.C. 2016).  The Article III case-or-controversy \nrequirement “is no less strict when a party is seeking a declaratory judgment than for any other \n5 The parties do not debate the cause of action through which this legal challenge must \nflow—whether it be the APA, an ultra vires claim, or a separation of powers claim.  These \ndistinctions can be meaningful.  See, e.g., Lewis v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 743 F. Supp. 3d 181, \n199–201 (D.D.C. 2024) (examining the compatibility of an APA and ultra vires claim).  The \nCourt does not interpret this issue to be jurisdictional, however, and does not address an question \nthe parties themselves declined to raise. \n16 \n\n197a\nrelief.”  Fed. Express Corp. v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, 67 F.3d 961, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing \nAltvater v. Freeman, 319 U.S. 359, 363 (1943)).  To establish that a matter is a “controversy” \nwithin the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III of the Constitution, a party \n“must ‘show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal \ninterests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.’”  \nHoffman v. Dist. of Columbia, 643 F. Supp. 2d 132, 140 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Md. Cas. Co. v. \nPac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941)).   \n“[A] declaratory judgment always rests within the sound discretion of the court,” \nPresident v. Vance, 627 F.2d 353, 365 n.76 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (citing Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. \nof America, 316 U.S. 491, 494 (1942)), and “[t]here are no dispositive factors a district court \nshould consider in determining whether it should entertain an action brought under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act.” New York v. Biden, 636 F. Supp. 3d 1, 31 (D.D.C. 2022) (quoting \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. FTC, 894 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (D.D.C. 2012)).  Several factors may be \nhelpful to the Court’s consideration of “the propriety of granting a declaratory judgment,” \nhowever, such as “whether it would finally settle the controversy between the parties”; “whether \nother remedies are available or other proceedings pending”; and “the public importance of the \nquestion to be decided.”  Hanes Corp. v. Millard, 531 F.2d 585, 592 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1976).  The \nCourt might also consider “1) whether the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying the \nlegal relations at issue, or 2) whether the judgment will terminate and afford relief from the \nuncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”  Glenn, 222 F. Supp. 3d \nat 36 (citing President, 627 F.2d at 365 n.76).   \nFirst, the Court finds a “controversy” here within the meaning of the Declaratory \nJudgment Act.  The parties place before the Court a “substantial controversy” over the \n17 \n\n198a\nlawfulness of the President’s effort to terminate Harris without cause, and whether she remains a \nmember of the MSPB.  Hoffman, 643 F. Supp. 2d at 140; see also Pl.’s Mot. at 11–26; Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 5–13.  The parties have adverse legal interests, with Defendants arguing that the \nPresident has a power that Harris claims he does not.  See, e.g., Defs.’ Opp’n at 5 (arguing that \nthe President’s removal power over principal officers is absolute).  This controversy is also “of \nsufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.”  Hoffman, \n643 F. Supp. 2d at 140.  The controversy here is not based, for instance, on “the occurrence of a \nfuture or contingent event,” but has rather come to a head after the President attempted to \nterminate Harris.  C.F. Folks, Ltd. v. DC Jefferson Bldg., LLC, 308 F. Supp. 3d 145, 150 (D.D.C. \n2018). \nThe Court additionally finds that declaratory relief is appropriate here.  A declaratory \n“judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations” between Harris and \nDefendants and abate ongoing “uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy” over her status as a \nmember of the MSPB.  Glenn, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 36.  The question is also one of significant \n“public importance,” Hanes Corp., 531 F.2d at 592 n.4, given that it concerns the structure and \nindependence of a federal agency.  Although “other remedies” may be available, id., declaratory \njudgment remains appropriate to clarify Harris’s legal status, particularly given the complexity of \ninjunctive relief in this area.  In addition, the Declaratory Judgment Act grants authority to enter \ndeclaratory judgment “whether or not further relief is or could be sought.”  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \nDefendants argue that the Court cannot issue declaratory judgment because it cannot \nenjoin the President.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 21–22 (citing Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70 \n(1971)).  First, the declaratory judgment here clarifies not just the President’s legal relationship \nwith MSPB members, but also subordinate officials’ legal rights and duties.  Second, the \n18 \n\n199a\nSupreme Court clarified in Samuels that it did “not mean to suggest that a declaratory judgment \nshould never be issued in cases of this type if it has been concluded that injunctive relief would \nbe improper.”  Samuels, 401 U.S. at 73.  “There may be unusual circumstances in which an \ninjunction might be withheld because, despite a plaintiff’s strong claim for relief under the \nestablished standards, the injunctive remedy seemed particularly intrusive or offensive.”  Id.  \n“[I]n such a situation, a declaratory judgment might be appropriate and might not be contrary to \nthe basic equitable doctrines governing the availability of relief.”  Id.  Courts withhold injunctive \nrelief against the President precisely because it is considered “particularly intrusive or \noffensive,” and declaratory judgment remains warranted here given Harris’s “strong claim for \nrelief under the established standards.”  Id.  Defendants additionally cite no controlling authority \nfor the notion that declaratory judgment may not clarify the legal relationship between the \nPresident and other parties.  To the contrary, appellate courts have previously affirmed the \nissuance of declaratory relief involving the President.  See Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, \n492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (considering declaratory judgment to be a less drastic remedy \nthan a writ of mandamus); see also Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 421 (1998) \n(affirming declaratory judgment that the President’s actions under Line Item Veto Act were \ninvalid). \nFor these reasons, the Court enters declaratory judgment in this case clarifying that Harris \nremains a member of the MSPB, and that she may not be removed from her position absent \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. \n2. Permanent Injunction\nHarris additionally seeks a permanent injunction barring several officials—not including \nthe President—from removing her or treating her as removed.  See Compl. ¶¶ 45–46; Pl.’s Mot. \n19 \n\n200a\nat 28–30; Pl.’s Proposed Order, ECF No. 22-1.  Defendants argue that Harris is not entitled to an \ninjunction because the Court lacks the power to issue equitable relief “reinstating” an officer \nremoved by the President.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 14–18.  Defendants also contend that Harris has not \nsuffered an irreparable injury and that the balance of the equities weigh in their favor.  See id. at \n18–21.  The Court must therefore examine its power to issue equitable relief here before it \nconsiders whether to issue that relief. \na. Availability of Injunctive Relief\nDefendants argue that Harris’s remedy must be limited to backpay, and that an injunction \nis inappropriate because that relief was not “traditionally accorded by courts of equity” to \nremedy an official’s wrongful removal from office.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 14 (quoting Grupo \nMexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999)).  Plaintiff \nresponds that federal courts have long granted injunctive relief reinstating federal employees, \nand that mandamus should be available in the alternative.  See Pl.’s Reply at 10–19. \nIn Grupo Mexicano, the Supreme Court considered whether “a United States District \nCourt has the power to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the [debtor] defendant from \ntransferring assets in which no lien or equitable interest is claimed.”  527 U.S. at 310.  The Court \nexplained that “equity is flexible; but in the federal system, at least, that flexibility is confined \nwithin the broad boundaries of traditional equitable relief.”  Id. at 322.  “[E]quity jurisdiction of \nthe federal courts is the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court of Chancery in \nEngland at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the enactment of the original \nJudiciary Act, 1789 (1 Stat. 73).”  Id. at 318 (quoting A. Dobie, Handbook of Federal \nJurisdiction and Procedure 660 (1928)).  The Court concluded that because the Court of \nChancery lacked “an equitable power to restrict a debtor’s use of his unencumbered property \n20 \n\n201a\nbefore judgment,” a contemporary federal court lacks that power as well.  Id. at 322; see also id. \nat 319–20.  Defendants similarly reason that because the Court of Chancery did not issue \ninjunctions returning public officials to their offices, this Court cannot either.  See Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 14–15.  That contention stumbles, however, for at least two reasons. \nThe first is on-point Supreme Court guidance.  In Sampson v. Murray, the Supreme Court \nconsidered whether a probationary employee at the General Services Administration could \nreceive a temporary restraining order enjoining her dismissal during an administrative appeal to \nthe Civil Service Commission.  415 U.S. 61, 62–63 (1974).  The Court explained that a district \ncourt has “authority to grant interim injunctive relief to a discharged Government employee,” id. \nat 63, but that the plaintiff before the Court did not make the elevated “showing of irreparable \ninjury sufficient in kind and degree to override” the Government’s usual autonomy over its \ninternal affairs, id. at 84.  Loss of wages and reputation could be remedied through further \nproceedings and was not enough to warrant injunctive relief for a federal employee, see id. at \n91–92, but that relief may be appropriate “in the genuinely extraordinary situation,” rather than \n“in the routine case.”  Id. at 92 n.68.  The Court specifically addressed White v. Berry, in which \nthe Supreme Court reasoned that “a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and \nremoval of public officers.”  171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 \n(1888)).  The Sampson Court asserted that “[m]uch water has flowed over the dam since 1898,” \nand that subsequent cases had recognized that federal courts are generally empowered to review \nthe claims of discharged federal employees.  Sampson, 415 U.S. 71–72 (citing Service v. Dulles, \n354 U.S. 363 (1957)); see also Kloeckner, 568 U.S. at 44–46 (discussing remedies for federal \nemployee under the CSRA, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967); Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 22 (2012) \n21 \n\n202a\n(listing “reinstatement” as among “the kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers” courts to \nprovide).  Harris’s situation is additionally akin to that of the Sampson plaintiff because there is a \nfederal standard to which Harris’s hiring and firing must adhere, and one that the Court must \nenforce.  Sampson thus instructs that equitable relief is available to Harris if she can show that \nher termination represents a “genuinely extraordinary situation,” rather than a “routine case.”  \nSampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68.6  Sampson is not unique; the Supreme Court has repeatedly \ndetermined that plaintiff federal employees were entitled to reinstatement after termination \nviolated their legal rights.  See Service, 354 U.S. at 388–89; Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, \n546 (1959); see also Miller v. Clinton, 687 F.3d 1332, 1360 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting) (explaining that for a federal employee experiencing “unconstitutional \ndiscrimination, equitable relief could include an injunction prior to termination or reinstatement \nsubsequent to termination”). \nThe D.C. Circuit has also found injunctive relief against subordinate federal officials to \nbe available to restore presidential appointees to their offices, although the Government did not \nraise the scope of historical equitable relief in those cases.  See Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, \n976–81 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042–43 (D.C. Cir. 2023).7  In Swan, \nthe six-year term of a member of the Board of the National Credit Union Administration \n(“NCUA”) had expired, but he remained in office because the relevant statute allowed members \nto serve until their successors had qualified.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 975–76.  President Clinton \n6 There can additionally be no dispute that federal courts may grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \nInc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015) (citing Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, \n110 (1902)).   \n7 Cases before other courts add further evidence that this power exists.  See Pl.’s Reply at \n11–12 (collecting cases). \n22 \n\n203a\nremoved the board member, who then sued seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction \nordering his reinstatement.  See id.  The court assessed the board member’s standing to bring the \ncase, focusing on whether his claims were judicially redressable.  Id. at 976–81.  The court was \nuncertain of its power to enjoin the President himself from removing the plaintiff from office, see \nid. at 977–78, but reasoned that it could instead “ensure the rule of law” by issuing “injunctive \nrelief against subordinate officials” effectuating his reinstatement “de facto by” requiring his \ncolleagues to treat him “as a member of the NCUA Board and allowing him to exercise the \nprivileges of that office,” id. at 978, 980.  This encompassed, for instance, “including [the \nplaintiff official] in Board meetings, giving him access to his former office, recording his votes \nas official votes of a Board member, allowing him to draw the salary of a Board member etc.”8   \nId. at 980.  The Circuit reprised this analysis in Severino, in which President Biden removed a \nmember of the Administrative Conference of the United States Council, see Severino, 71 F.4th at \n1041, and the plaintiff had standing because a court could “enjoin ‘subordinate executive \nofficials’ to reinstate a wrongly terminated official ‘de facto,’ even without a formal presidential \nreappointment,” id. at 1042–43 (quoting Swan, 100 F.3d at 980).9 \nSecond, it is also clear that even if Sampson, Swan, and Severino did not make equitable \nrelief available to Harris in a “genuinely extraordinary situation,” she would nonetheless be \nentitled to a writ of mandamus—which is a remedy at law.  See Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. D.C. \n8 The Circuit ultimately concluded that the board member’s claim failed on the merits \nbecause, even assuming that NCUA board members had removal protections, holdover members \nwould be entitled to no such protection.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 983–88. \n9 Defendants argue that these cases are not on point because the courts there were \nconsidering the redressability of the plaintiffs’ claims when evaluating their standing.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 16; Swan, 100 F.3d 976–81; Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042–43.  Yet the Circuit’s reasoning \nis no mere dicta, as a federal court must determine that it has the power to grant effective relief \nbefore assuming jurisdiction over a case.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–\n61 (1992). \n23 \n\n204a\n310, 319–21 (D.C. Cir. 1914) (collecting cases); see also Pl.’s Reply at 15–16 (collecting \nsources).  To the extent that English equity courts declined to issue injunctions reinstating \nofficials to their positions, they likely did so because the King’s Bench, a court of law, would \nreadily issue mandamus instead.  See Walkley v. City of Muscatine, 73 U.S. 481, 483–84 (1867) \n(explaining, relying on English cases, that “a court of equity is invoked” only where “a court of \nlaw . . . is inadequate to afford the proper remedy”); Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton & \nWoolen Co., 67 U.S. 545, 550–51 (1862) (similar).  English courts around the time of the \nfounding recognized this power and exercised it regularly.  See, e.g., R. v. Mayor of London, 100 \nEng. Rep. 96, 98 (1787) (recognizing power to issue mandamus reinstating public official);10 R. \nv. Mayor and Aldermen of Doncaster (1752), 96 Eng. Rep. 795 (restoring municipal official to \nhis office after removal by town council); R. v. Mayor, Bailiffs, and Common Council of the \nTown of Liverpool (1759), 97 Eng. Rep. 533 (same);11 R. v. Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of \nDoncaster (1729), 92 Eng. Rep. 513 (same); 73 Eng. Rep. at 752 (discussing Thompson v. \nEdmonds, in which the King’s Bench restored a bailiff to his office because he “was removed” \nby the mayor “without cause”); R. v. Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of Gloucester, 90 \nEng. Rep. 1148 (restoring official to office of capital burgess).  Numerous treatises further \nconfirm this practice.  See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *264–265 (“The writ of mandamus is \n. . . a most full and effective remedy, in the first place, for refusal of admission where a person is \nentitled to an office or place in any such [municipal] corporation; and, secondly, for wrongful \n10 During this case, respected trial lawyer Thomas Erskine explained that “[w]henever a \nperson is improperly suspended or removed from an office, whether it concern public or private \nduties, if he has a certain term in it, and there are profits annexed to it, and the party has no other \nspecific legal remedy, the Court will grant mandamus to restore him.”  100 Eng. Rep. at 97. \n11 Here, Lord Mansfield explained that when officials respond to an action for \nmandamus, “the return must set out all the necessary facts, precisely; to shew that the person is \nremoved in legal and proper manner, and for a legal cause.”  97 Eng. Rep. at 537. \n24 \n\n205a\nremoval, when a person is legally possessed.”); Thomas Tapping, The Law and Practice of the \nHigh Prerogative Writ of Mandamus as it Obtains Both in England and in Ireland 221 (1853) \n(“The writ of mandamus . . . has by a great number of cases held to be grantable . . . to restore \nhim who has been wrongfully displaced, to any office, function, or franchise of a public nature \n. . . .”); id. at 224 (distinguishing an officer “at pleasure” who may be removed without cause).12  \nEven the treatise cited in Defendants’ opposition explains that a court sitting in equity would \n“not interfere by injunction” in such cases simply because it would instead “leave that question \nto be determined by a legal forum.”  2 James L. High, Treatise on the Law of Injunctions § 1312 \n(2d ed. 1880); see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  This was the state of the law at the time of the \nfounding, as well as when Congress passed the All Writs Act as part of the Judiciary Act of \n1789.  See Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 40 (1985).  For this reason, \nthe Supreme Court was careful in both In re Sawyer and White v. Berry to specify that \nmandamus was available “to determine the title to a public office” in “the courts of law.”  In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. at 212; White, 171 U.S. at 377.13 \n12 Later treatises provide additional support for use of the writ of mandamus “for the \npurpose of restoring an individual to an office, where he has been illegally deprived of the \npossession thereof.”  Horace G. Wood, A Treatise on the Legal Remedies of Mandamus and \nProhibition, Habeas Corpus, Certiorari and Quo Warranto 11 (1891).  “When the title to the \noffice is indisputable,” proceedings for the writ of quo warranto would be “dilatory” and “a \nmandamus would be proper and should be awarded.”  Id. at 12 (quoting 7 How., 128); see also 1 \nHoward Clifford Joyce, A Treatise on the Law Relating to Injunctions § 55 (1909) (“The \njurisdiction to determine the title to a public office belongs only to courts of law and is exercised \n. . . by mandamus . . . and the mode of procedure established by the common law or by statute”); \n2 Eugene McQuillin, A Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations § 582 (1911) (same). \n13 Defendants argue that Harris was effectively removed from office and seeks a court \norder returning her to it.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  The D.C. Circuit has clarified that this is not \nthe case, and that Harris was never in fact removed.  See Kalbfus, 42 App. D.C. at 321 (“In the \npresent case the removal of the relator having been illegal and void, the office never became \nvacant . . . .”). \n25 \n\n206a\nAs the Court explains below, however, a writ of mandamus can issue under our \ncontemporary jurisprudence only when “the party seeking issuance of the writ ha[s] no other \nadequate means to attain the relief he desires.”  Kerr v. U. S. Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of California, \n426 U.S. 394, 403 (1976) (citing Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass’n, 319 U.S. 21, 26 (1943)).  \nBecause the Court reads Sampson, Swan, and Severino to allow it to issue an injunction, it \nconcludes that this injunction represents “adequate means” to provide Harris’s requested relief, \nbarring a mandamus remedy.  Kerr, 426 U.S. at 403.  This represents a curious reversal from \nnorms before English courts, where reinstatement of officials through legal means was preferred \nover restoration through equitable means.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 976–81; Severino, 71 F.4th at  \n1042–43.  Yet the broader point is that this Court may provide Harris some form of effective \nrelief preventing her unlawful termination from the MSPB, whether it be through an injunction \nor a writ of mandamus.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 977 n.1 (explaining that a request for injunction \nand request for writ of mandamus can be “essentially” the same thing in some contexts).  \nFinally, Defendants argue that the Court cannot enjoin the President or enjoin others in a \nmanner that restricts his Article II authority.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 16.  To be clear, Harris does \nnot ask the Court to enjoin President Trump, see, e.g., Pl.’s Proposed Order, and the Court does \nnot do so.14  Yet Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that a court lacks the power to \nenjoin the President’s subordinates to restrain the President’s violation of law.  In fact, that is \n14 The availability of injunctive relief against the President may depend in part on \nwhether compliance with 5 U.S.C. 1202(d) represents a ministerial rather than executive duty, a \nquestion the Supreme Court has “left open.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 \n(1992) (plurality opinion); see also State of Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475, 498 (1866) \n(declining to decide whether a court may require the President “to perform a purely ministerial \nact,” and defining a “ministerial duty” as “one in respect to which nothing is left to discretion); \nMcCray v. Biden, 574 F. Supp. 3d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2021) (“Franklin, however, did not absolutely \nslam the door shut on presidential injunctions.”).  Of course, the Court need not decide this \nquestion here. \n26 \n\n207a\nprecisely the remedy the Supreme Court affirmed in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579, 584 (1952) (describing preliminary injunction restraining Secretary of Commerce \nfrom following President Truman’s orders and “continuing the seizure and possession of the \n[steel] plant”).  And in Swan v. Clinton, the D.C. Circuit concluded that a district court could \nenjoin the President’s subordinates in order to effectuate a federal official’s reinstatement.  See \n100 F.3d at 979; see also id. (concluding that “injunctive relief against such officials could \nsubstantially redress [the terminated official’s] injury”); see also Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042–43.  \nHaving assured itself that injunctive relief is available here, the Court proceeds to consider \nwhether a permanent injunction is warranted.15 \nb. Factors for Permanent Injunction\nAn injunction “is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  Yet “it goes without saying that federal courts \nmust vigilantly enforce federal law and must not hesitate in awarding necessary relief.”  DL v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 860 F.3d 713, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. \n433, 450 (2009)).  A permanent injunction is a “forward-looking” remedy, Gratz v. Bollinger, \n539 U.S. 244, 284 (2003), the “principal purpose” of which is to “deter future violations, and not \nto punish the violator,” Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1169 (D.C. \nCir. 1978).  “[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a \ncourt may grant such relief.”  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).  A \nplaintiff must demonstrate: “(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies \n15 Defendants additionally suggest that “when executive officers have challenged their \nremoval by the President, they have traditionally sought back pay, not reinstatement.”  Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 13.  The Court fails to see how it might lack the power to issue injunctive relief here \nsimply because the plaintiffs in Wiener and Humphrey’s Executor decided to seek another \nremedy. \n27 \n\n208a\navailable at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) \nthat, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity \nis warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  \nId.  Where the federal government is the opposing party, the balance of equities and public \ninterest factors merge.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The Supreme Court “has \nrepeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been \nirreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.”  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 \nU.S. 305, 312 (1982); see also Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, \n297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (same). \nFor the same reasons the Court discussed in its previous opinion, Harris has established \nthat she has suffered irreparable harm and will likely suffer irreparable harm in the future absent \ninjunctive relief.  See Mem. Op. at 11–19; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 540 F. Supp. 3d. 45, 55 (D.D.C. May 21, 2021) (“While the irreparable-harm \nrequirement is recited in the past tense, it is clear that future harm may qualify.” (citing \nMonsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 162 (2010))).  Congress intended the \nMSPB and its members to carry out their limited duties with a degree of independence from the \nPresident, guided primarily by his selection of members for the multimember board rather than \n“the Damocles’ sword of removal.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  As the Court reasoned in its \nprevious memorandum opinion, the MSPB’s independence would evaporate if the President \ncould terminate its members without cause, even if a court could later order them reinstated.  See \nMem. Op. at 16.  Harris has undoubtedly experienced an injury to this independence in her \ncapacity as a member of the MSPB following the President’s attempt to terminate her without \ncause, and any future attempts would prove just as harmful to that autonomy.   \n28 \n\n209a\nHarris additionally suffers irreparable harm because she has been “depriv[ed] of [her] \nstatutory right to function” as a member of the MSPB, and any further attempts to separate her \nfrom her position will exacerbate this injury.  Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983).  The termination email Harris received resulted in the inability to pursue \nher “statutory mission” to protect employees from prohibited personnel practices, such that “the \nloss of the ability to do what Congress specifically directed [her] to do cannot be remediated with \nanything other than equitable relief.”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at \n*11 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025).  In addition, unlike most other federal employees, Harris was duly \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to a position carrying a term of years \nwith specific reasons for her removal.   \nThe Court finds that this harm represents a “genuinely extraordinary situation” meriting \ninjunctive relief related to a federal employee’s discharge.  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68; see \nalso Mem. Op. at 12–13 (discussing Sampson).  The clear federal statute granting Harris for-\ncause removal protections, coupled with longstanding precedent upholding the constitutionality \nof analogous provisions, overcomes the “latitude” traditionally afforded the Government “in the \n‘dispatch of its own internal affairs.’”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83.  The plaintiff in Sampson, who \nfailed to meet this standard, sought an injunction temporarily enjoining her dismissal during an \nadministrative appeal.  See id. at 63.  Yet the parties point to no administrative pathway here \nthrough which Harris could seek reinstatement following improper termination.  Furthermore, \nwhereas the Sampson plaintiff was a probational employee, see id. at 62, Harris is a member of \nthe board of an independent agency, was appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate, and enjoys tenure protections to preserve her independence. \n29 \n\n210a\nFor similar reasons, it is also apparent that “remedies available at law, such as monetary \ndamages, are inadequate to compensate for” Harris’s injuries.  eBay Inc., 547 U.S. at 391.  \nDefendants argue that loss of salary generally does not represent irreparable harm.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 19.  As the Court has explained, however, this is not a standard employment action that \ncan be remedied through back pay and later reinstatement, and Harris’s claims do not revolve \naround her salary.  See Mem. Op. at 15.   \nDefendants additionally cite Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997), for the notion that “a \nloss of political power” does not represent injury.  Defs.’ Mot. at 15.  Raines is a case about \nlegislators’ standing to sue over legislation they perceive to cede power to the Executive Branch, \nand the case has minimal application to the irreparable injury analysis here.  See 521 U.S. at \n820–21.  Harris is not a member of Congress, nor is standing at issue.  The Supreme Court \nreasoned in Raines that any injury would be far too diffuse to support the legislators’ standing, as \nit was spread across both Houses of Congress, and the legislators did not claim injury arising \nfrom “something to which they personally are entitled.”  Id. at 821.  If anything, Raines supports \nHarris’s claim to injury based on exclusion from her office: she has “been singled out for \nspecially unfavorable treatment as opposed to other Members,” and has lost something to which \nshe is “personally” entitled.  Id.   \nFinally, injunctive relief in this case is in the public interest, and the balance of the \nequities tips in Harris’s favor.  Given that federal law limits the conditions under which Harris’s \ntenure may be terminated, Supreme Court precedent supports the constitutionality of those \nconditions, and Defendants do not argue that those conditions were met here, the Court finds that \nit is in the public interest to issue injunctive relief.  “[T]here is a substantial public interest ‘in \nhaving governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and \n30 \n\n211a\noperations.’”  League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. \n2016) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).  So too is there \nsubstantial public interest in the for-cause removal protections Congress has given to certain \nmembers of independent agencies.  Furthermore, the government “cannot suffer harm from an \ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice or reads a statute as required.”  R.I.L-R v. \nJohnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, \n1145 (9th Cir. 2013)). \nDefendants suggest that the public interest weighs against injunctive relief here because \n“[s]uch a remedy would undermine the accountability of the Executive Branch instilled by the \nConstitution,” and the President “cannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal \nofficer.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 20–21.  This argument largely relies on Defendants’ success on the \nmerits, and the Court has already determined that the President lacks the power to remove Harris \nat will.  Defendants additionally argue that “the public interest is better served by an MSPB \nmember who holds the President’s confidence.”  Id. at 21.  Yet Defendants decline to explain \nexactly how the public interest would be better served by removing Harris from her position.  \nThey do not dispute any of Harris’s factual assertions, including her efforts to consider, \ndeliberate, and vote on 35 cases per week to clear the MSPB’s backlog of nearly 3,800 cases.  \nSee SUMF ¶¶ 12–28.  This effort was successful, as by early this year the inherited cases had all \nbut disappeared.  See id. ¶ 20.  Recall that many of these cases involve allegations that federal \nagencies engaged in prohibited personnel practices, such as targeting of federal employees based \non political affiliation; retaliation against whistleblowers reporting violations of law, waste, fraud \nand abuse; discrimination; and USERRA violations, among others.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 4–5 \n(collecting cases).  Defendants make no effort to enlighten the Court as to how Harris’s handling \n31 \n\n212a\nof these cases might differ from the President’s preferred approach, let alone in a manner that \nmight tilt the public interest factor in their favor.  Defendants additionally overlook the fact that \nif Harris or her colleagues were ever to become inefficient, neglect their duty, or engage in \nmalfeasance in office, the President would be empowered to remove them for cause.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202(d).  The Court thus finds nothing in Defendants’ arguments that might support a \npublic interest against injunctive relief here. \nThe Court additionally notes that in opposing injunctive relief in its entirety, Defendants \nhave declined to engage with the scope of Harris’s proposed relief.  See generally Proposed \nOrder; Defs.’ Opp’n.  The Court will nonetheless tailor its declaratory and injunctive relief to \nmeet Harris’s entitlement under the law.16 \n3. Writ of Mandamus\nHarris requests that the Court issue a writ of mandamus if no other relief is available.  See \nPl.’s Mot. at 34–35.  Defendants argue that the President has no clear nondiscretionary duty here, \nas his selection of “who should lead an Executive Branch agency is certainly not a mere \nministerial task.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 22.   \n“The preemptory common-law writs are among the most potent weapons in the judicial \narsenal.”  Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 107 (1967).  A district court has “original \njurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus” only if  “(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to \nrelief; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy \n16 Although injunctive relief is merited, the Court narrows Harris’s request slightly.  \nHarris seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting several Defendants from removing her or \ntreating her as removed.  See Proposed Order.  Yet § 1202(d) permits the President to remove her \nfor inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  The Court nonetheless notes the \nundisputed record demonstrating that Harris and her colleagues have carried out their duties to \ndecide cases in addition to clearing a significant backlog. \n32 \n\n213a\navailable to [the] plaintiff.”  In re Nat’l Nurses United, 47 F.4th 746, 752 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Muthana v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 893, 910 (D.C. Cir. 2021)).  “[M]andamus jurisdiction \nunder § 1361 merges with the merits.”  Muthana, 985 F.3d at 910 (quoting Lovitky v. Trump, 949 \nF.3d 753, 759 (D.C. Cir. 2020)).  “[E]ven if the plaintiff overcomes all these hurdles, whether \nmandamus relief should issue is discretionary.”  In re Cheney, 406 F.3d 723, 729 (D.C. Cir. \n2005). \nThe Court finds the first two requirements for mandamus relief to be satisfied.  A court \n“can analyze the clear right to relief and clear duty to act requirements for mandamus \n‘concurrently.’”  Illinois v. Ferriero, 60 F.4th 704, 715 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Lovitky, 949 \nF.3d at 760).  “[T]o meet the ‘clear duty to act’ standard, ‘[t]he law must not only authorize the \ndemanded action, but require it; the duty must be clear and indisputable.’”  Ferriero, 60 F.4th at \n715 (quoting United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, 283 U.S. 414, 420 (1931).  Based on the \nCourt’s holding that federal law precludes the President’s power to remove Harris at will, the \nCourt finds a duty here that is clear and indisputable, and under binding Supreme Court \nprecedent there is no “room for an honest difference of opinion” on the part of federal officials.  \nReichelderfer v. Johnson, 72 F.2d 552, 554 (D.C. Cir. 1934).  In other words, the statute does not \nprovide room for executive discretion—the President has no menu of options to pick from when \nhe categorically may not remove Harris without cause.  In making this determination, the Court \nadditionally looks to the voluminous precedent demonstrating that courts of law issued \nmandamus relief in similar situations at the time Congress passed the All Writs Act in 1789 and \nover the ensuing centuries. \nAs the Court previewed earlier, however, it appears at present that Harris has a separate, \n“adequate remedy” available in the form of a permanent injunction.  In re Nat’l Nurses United, \n33 \n\n214a\n47 F.4th at 752 n.4.  The Court thus determines that her request for mandamus relief fails on that \nbasis alone.  Were equitable injunctive relief unavailable here, however, the Court would not \nhesitate to “vigilantly enforce federal law” and “award[] necessary relief” through a writ of \nmandamus as an alternative remedy at law.  DL, 860 F.3d at 726. \nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris’s motion for summary judgment is \nGRANTED; and it is  \nDECLARED that Plaintiff Cathy A.

INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris was appointed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) \non June 1, 2022, to a term set to expire on March 1, 2028.  Federal law states that members of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board may be removed from office “only for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.”  On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump informed \nHarris that her position on the MSPB was “terminated, effective immediately” but provided no \nreason for Harris’s termination.  The following day, Harris filed this lawsuit against President \nTrump and several other federal officials (“Defendants”), claiming that her termination violated \nfederal law.  She moves for a temporary restraining order declaring her removal from office to be \nunlawful, declaring that she remains a member of the MSPB, and enjoining Defendants from \ntreating her as having been removed.  For the following reasons, the Court grants that motion \nwhile the parties fully brief a motion for a preliminary injunction. \n\n219a\nII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Statutory Background\nCongress created the Merit Systems Protection Board as a component of the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978, which “establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions taken \nagainst federal employees.”  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 44 (2012); see also Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978 (“CSRA”), Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121–25 (1978) \n(codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 1201–05).  Congress’s Findings and Statement of Purpose indicate that \n“[i]t is the policy of the United States that . . . to provide the people of the United States with a \ncompetent, honest, and productive Federal work force[,] . . . Federal personnel management \nshould be implemented consistent with merit system principles.”  CSRA § 3, 92 Stat. at 1112.  \nThose merit system principles include, among others, “[r]ecruitment . . . from qualified \nindividuals” where “selection and advancement [is] determined solely on the basis of relative \nability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive \nequal opportunity.”  Id. § 101, 92 Stat. at 1113 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301).  Congress \nadditionally instructed that “[e]mployees should be . . . protected against arbitrary action, \npersonal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes,” as well as “against reprisal for \nthe lawful disclosure of information which the employees reasonably believe evidences,” among \nother things, violations of law, gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or substantial and \nspecific dangers to public health or safety.  Id. \nThe CSRA established the MSPB as “an independent agency consisting of three \nmembers” and “charged [it] with protecting the merit system principles and adjudicating \nconflicts between federal workers and their employing agencies.”  Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. \nBd., 672 F.2d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see also CSRA § 101, 92 Stat. at 1114–17 (codified at 5 \n2 \n\n220a\nU.S.C. § 2302) (establishing prohibited personnel practices, such as employment discrimination, \nunlawful political activities, and any other violations of law within the federal civil service).  The \nBoard reviews federal employee appeals of adverse actions “which [are] appealable to the Board \nunder any law, rule, or regulation,” including those related to removal or suspension for periods \ngreater than fourteen days.  5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); see also id. § 1204(a)(1).  It may order federal \nagencies and employees to comply with its decisions and conduct studies “relating to the civil \nservice” for the President and Congress.  5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2), (a)(3).  The MSPB also reviews \n“rules and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management.”  Id. § 1204(a)(4).  The MSPB’s \nfinal decisions are generally subject to judicial review.  See id. § 7703. \nMembers of the MSPB are “appointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate,” and “not more than 2 of [the members] may be adherents of the same \npolitical party.”  CSRA § 202 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1201).  Members of the MSPB are \nappointed to seven-year terms that may be extended by up to one year if a successor has not yet \nbeen appointed.  Id. (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1202(a)–(c)).  “Any member may be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. (codified at 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202(d)). \nB.  Factual Background\nPresident Joseph R. Biden initially nominated Harris to be a member of the MSPB on \nJune 24, 2021, and renominated her on January 4, 2022.  Compl. ¶ 24, ECF No. 1.  The Senate \nconfirmed Harris on May 25, 2022, and she was sworn in on June 1, 2022.  Id.  Her term expires \non March 1, 2028.  Id.  The Senate later confirmed Harris as Chairman, and she was sworn in as \nChairman on March 14, 2024.  Id. ¶ 25.   \n3 \n\n221a\nOn February 10, 2025, Harris received an email from Trent Morse, Deputy Assistant to \nthe President and the Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, which \nstated in its entirety: \nOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your \nposition on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective \nimmediately. Thank you for your service[.] \nEx. A to Compl., ECF No. 1-1; see also Ex. A to Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 2-2.  The \ncommunication does not explain the basis for Harris’s termination. \nHarris filed this lawsuit on February 11, 2025, claiming that her firing was ultra vires, \nunconstitutional, and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  See Compl. ¶¶ 31–37, 40–\n41. She seeks relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, issuance of a writ of mandamus, and\nequitable relief.  See id. ¶¶ 38–39, 42–46.  Harris additionally filed a motion for a temporary \nrestraining order, see Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 2, which Defendants oppose, see Defs.’ \nOpp’n to Mot. for TRO (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 6.  On February 13, 2025, the Court held a \nhearing on the TRO motion. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\n“The purpose of a temporary restraining order is to preserve the status quo for a limited \nperiod of time until the Court has the opportunity to pass on the merits of the demand for a \npreliminary injunction.”  Barrow v. Graham, 124 F. Supp. 2d 714, 715–16 (D.D.C. 2000) (citing \nWarner Bros. Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc., 877 F.2d 1120, 1125 (2d Cir. 1989)).  “An \napplication for a TRO is analyzed using the same factors applicable to a request for preliminary \ninjunctive relief.”  Scottsdale Cap. Advisors Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., Inc., 678 F. Supp. \n3d 88, 99 (D.D.C. 2023) (citing Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 723–24 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).   \n“A preliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the [movant] is entitled to such relief.’”  John Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot.  \n4 \n\n222a\nBureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  “The last two factors ‘merge when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.’”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & \nExplosives, 920 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  \n“Of course, the movant carries the burden of persua[ding]” the Court that these factors merit \npreliminary relief, Fla. EB5 Invs., LLC v. Wolf, 443 F. Supp. 3d 7, 11 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing \nCobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2004)), and must do so by making a “clear \nshowing,” Cobell, 391 F.3d at 258.  A district court must generally consider and balance each of \nthese factors in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.  See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 \nF.3d 388, 392–93 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  “A preliminary injunction may be granted based on less \nformal procedures and on less extensive evidence than in a trial on the merits.”  Cobell, 391 F.3d \nat 261.   \nIV.  ANALYSIS\nThe Court concludes that Harris has established a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits, that irreparable harm is likely to occur in the absence of injunctive relief, and that the \npublic interest weighs in favor of enjoining Defendants’ actions.  Harris has thus carried her \nburden to establish that a temporary restraining order is warranted here. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nHarris argues that she is likely to prevail on the merits of her claims based on Supreme \nCourt precedent and the nature of the MSPB’s powers.  See Mem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for TRO \n5 \n\n223a\n(“Pl.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 2-1.  Specifically, she argues that Humphrey’s Executor v. United States \nand its progeny confirm the constitutionality of the conditions placed on removal of MSPB \nmembers.  295 U.S. 602 (1935); see also Pl.’s Mot. at 5–6.  She additionally cites the MSPB’s \nlimited authority, quasi-legislative functions, need for independence, and accountability to \nCongress and the President as reasons for the constitutionality of members’ appointment for a \nterm of years with specific conditions for removal.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 8–10.  Defendants argue \nthat Humphrey’s Executor does not apply because the MSPB exercises executive power—it may \nissue orders to federal employees, adjudicate and take final action, and litigate on its own behalf.  \nSee Defs.’ Opp’n at 7.  The Court concludes that Harris has demonstrated a likelihood of success \non the merits. \nHumphrey’s Executor appears to dictate the outcome of this case.  The Federal Trade \nCommission (“FTC”) comprises five members “appointed by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate,” and “[n]ot more than three of the commissioners shall be \nmembers of the same political party.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619–20 (quoting 15 \nU.S.C. § 41).  “Any Commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41).  In Humphrey’s Executor, \nPresident Hoover had appointed William Humphrey as a member of the Federal Trade \nCommission, which carried a term of seven years.  295 U.S. at 612.  Less than two years later, \nPresident Roosevelt terminated Humphrey over differences of political opinion, stating, \n“[e]ffective as of this date you are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the \nFederal Trade Commission.”  Id. at 619.  Humphry died several months later, but his estate sued \nto recover backpay on the basis that his removal was unlawful.  Id. at 612. \n6 \n\n224a\nThe Supreme Court confirmed that President Roosevelt’s termination of Humphry was \nindeed unlawful.  The Court observed that “[t]he statute fixes a term of office, in accordance \nwith many precedents.”  Id. at 623.  The Court further explained: \nThe commission is to be nonpartisan; and it must, from the very nature of its \nduties, act with entire impartiality.  It is charged with the enforcement of no \npolicy except the policy of the law.  Its duties are neither political nor executive, \nbut predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative.  Like the Interstate \nCommerce Commission, its members are called upon to exercise the trained \njudgment of a body of experts “appointed by law and informed by experience.” \nId. at 624.  The Court differentiated FTC members from the postmaster in Myers v. United \nStates, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) (evaluating statute stating that postmasters “shall hold their offices for \nfour years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law”).  “A postmaster is an \nexecutive officer restricted to the performance of executive functions” and is “charged with no \nduty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power.”  Id. at 627.  The FTC, in contrast, \n“acts in part quasi legislatively and in part quasi judicially” rather than exercising traditional \nexecutive powers.  Id. at 629.  “We think it plain under the Constitution that illimitable power of \nremoval is not possessed by the President in respect of officers of the character of those just \nnamed,” the Court concluded.  Id.   \nTwo decades later, the Court considered President Eisenhower’s removal of a member of \nthe War Claims Commission, whom President Truman had appointed and the Senate had \nconfirmed.  See Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958).  Congress charged that \ncommission with processing “claims for compensating internees, prisoners of war, and religious \norganizations . . . who suffered personal injury or property damage at the hands of the enemy in \nconnection with World War II,” and the commissioners’ terms were limited by the short duration \nof the commission’s existence.  Id.  The Court reasoned that Congress intended to “preclude[] \nthe President from influencing the Commission in passing on a particular claim,” which meant \n7 \n\n225a\nthat the President naturally could not “hang . . . the Damocles’ sword of removal” over the \ncommissioners.  Id. at 356.  The Court reaffirmed that the President had “no such power” to \n“remove a member of an adjudicatory body like the War Claims Commission merely because he \nwanted his own appointees on such a Commission.”  Id.1 \nThe Supreme Court recently recognized the constitutionality of this narrow restriction on \nthe President’s removal power in Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 215 (2020).  Humprey’s Executor, the Court explained, “permitted Congress to give \nfor-cause removal protections to a multimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, \nthat performed legislative and judicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive \npower.”  Id. at 216; see also Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, \n483 (2010) (summarizing Humphrey’s Executor as holding that “Congress can, under certain \ncircumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the President, \nwhom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause.”). \nThis case appears to be on all fours with Humphrey’s Executor.  The MSPB is “a \nmultimember body of experts” that is “balanced along partisan lines.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n215. The President will therefore likely have the “opportunity to shape its leadership and thereby\n1 The Court once again considered a multi-member body in Mistretta v. United States \nwhen passing on the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing Commission, which \nformally resides in the Judiciary.  488 U.S. 361 (1989).  The Sentencing Report Act of 1984 \nempowered the President to appoint commissioners to the Sentencing Commission, with \nmembers “subject to removal by the President ‘only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \nor for other good cause shown.’”  Id. at 368 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 991(a)).  When considering \nwhether the Act affords the President undue influence over federal judges who served as \ncommissioners, the Court recognized that “the President’s removal power under the Act is \nlimited.”  Id. at 410.  “Such congressional limitation on the President’s removal power, like the \nremoval provisions upheld in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and Humphrey’s Executor \n. . . , is specifically crafted to prevent the President from exercising ‘coercive influence’ over \nindependent agencies.”  Id. \n8 \n\n226a\ninfluence its activities.”  Id. at 225.  The CSRA envisions that the Board “is to be nonpartisan; \nand it must, from the very nature of its duties, act with entire impartiality.”  Humphrey’s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 624.  The CSRA also “fixes a term of office.”  Id. at 623.  The MSPB’s \nduties are “quasi judicial,” id. at 624, in that it conducts preliminary adjudication of federal \nemployees’ claims, which may then be appealed to the Federal Circuit.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 1204(a)(1), 7703.  Although the MSPB lacks its own rulemaking authority, Congress intended\nthe agency to aid its legislative goals by regularly transmitting reports to Congress regarding the \nBoard’s functions.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(l), 1205.  It is additionally evident that Congress hoped \nto “preclude[] the President from influencing the [Board] in passing on a particular claim.”  \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 356. \nThe MSPB additionally regulates government activity rather than that of private parties, \nlimiting the risk that its members can represent any “special threat to individual liberty.”  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 223; see also Pl.’s Mot. at 8 (emphasizing that “the MSPB does not regulate or \npenalize private activity”).  Instead, the MSPB primarily enforces merit system principles within \nthe federal government and responds to prohibited personnel practices, such as employment \ndiscrimination and retaliation against whistleblowers.  See 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b).  This authority is \nfundamentally narrower than that of the FTC, which regulates private conduct.  See 15 U.S.C. \n§45a–55 (defining scope of trade practices regulated by the FTC); id. § 45 (empowering FTC to\nregulate commerce); see also Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at *8 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025), aff’d, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (per curiam) (explaining \nthat the Office of Special Counsel “is not an agency endowed with the power to articulate, \nimplement, or enforce policy that affects a broad swath of the American public or its economy”).  \nThe Board also remains politically accountable to Congress and the President through the \n9 \n\n227a\nappropriations process in a manner inapplicable to independent agencies with their own funding \nsources.  See Selia Law, 591 U.S. at 226 (discussing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s \n“receipt of funds outside the appropriations process”); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 231 \n(2021) (observing that “the [Federal Housing Finance Agency] is not funded through the \nordinary appropriations process”). \nFinally, the MSPB’s mission and purpose require independence.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 9–10.  \nIn enacting the CSRA, Congress exercised its power to regulate the civil service.  See U.S. Civ. \nServ. Comm’n v. Nat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 413 U.S. 548, 555 (1973) (“Congress \nand the President are responsible for an efficient public service.” (quoting United Pub. Workers \nof Am. (C.I.O.) v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 99 (1947))).  It defined certain prohibited personnel \npractices, to include discrimination, loyalty oaths, coercion to engage in political activity, and \nretaliation against whistleblowers.  See 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1)–(3), (8).  Direct political control \nover the MSPB would have limited effect on the President’s implementation of his policy \nagenda.  It would instead neuter the CSRA’s statutory scheme by allowing high-ranking \ngovernment officials to engage in prohibited practices and then pressure the MSPB into inaction.  \nThe MSPB’s independence is therefore structurally inseparable from the CSRA itself.2 \nBecause the MSPB falls within the scope of Humphrey’s Executor, Congress has the \npower to specify that members of the MSPB may serve for a term of years, with the President \nempowered to remove those members only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice.  The President did not indicate that any of these reasons drove his decision to terminate \n2 Furthermore, the MSPB’s duties dovetail with United States v. Perkins, in which the \nSupreme Court held that Congress may place some limitations on the removal of inferior \nofficers.  116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886).  Denying independence to the Board would undermine these \nconstitutionally sound limitations on the removal of civil servants. \n10 \n\n228a\nHarris.  The Court thus concludes that Harris has demonstrated that she is likely to show her \ntermination as a member of the MSPB was unlawful.3 \nB. Irreparable Harm\nHarris asserts that she will suffer irreparable harm because, absent interim relief, she will \nbe deprived of her “statutory right to function” as a senior government official.  Pl.’s Mot. at 10 \n(quoting Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as \nmoot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam)).  She additionally contends that the injury will \nbe irreparable because her claim to MSPB membership may be frustrated by the appointment of \na successor.  Id. at 11.  She also argues that denial of emergency relief and confusion about the \nstatus of the MSPB may “deprive Plaintiff and the MSPB of the ‘ability to fulfill [their] mandate’ \nto federal employees.”  Id. (quoting Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5).  Defendants respond that Harris \ncannot claim irreparable harm as an employee separated from her position, see Defs.’ Opp’n at \n10–11, because the MSPB continues to function with a quorum, see id. at 11–13, and because the \nPresident has not yet nominated a successor, see id. at 13.  The Court concludes that Harris has \nestablished irreparable harm in this case.   \nTo sustain injunctive relief, the threat of irreparable injury must be “likely in the absence \nof an injunction,” rather than a mere “possibility.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  The injury must be \n3 Defendants argue that Harris cannot show entitlement to reinstatement because she has \nbeen removed from office, and “[t]he President cannot be compelled to retain the services of a \nprincipal officer whom the President no longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise of \nexecutive power.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 10.  Defendants posit that Harris’s remedy should be limited \nto back pay.  See id.  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974), discussed further below, appears \nto cut against this conclusion, as there the Supreme Court did “not wish to be understood as \nforeclosing [injunctive] relief in the genuinely extraordinary situation.”  Id. at 92 n.68.  In \naddition, the Court’s job at this stage is to determine whether to issue a temporary restraining \norder preserving the “the regime in place” before Defendants issued the termination order while \nthese issues are fully considered.  Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733 (D.C. Cir. \n2022).   \n11 \n\n229a\ntruly irreparable: “[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy \nnecessarily expended in the absence of a[n injunction] are not enough.”  Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. Fed. \nEnergy Reg. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  The “the irreparable \nharm analysis . . . assumes, without deciding, that the movant has demonstrated a likelihood that \nthe non-movant’s conduct violates the law.”  Id. at 303. \nIn addition, a federal employee seeking an injunction requiring the Government to \nemploy her during the course of litigation “must make a showing of irreparable injury sufficient \nin kind and degree to override” the Government’s traditional autonomy over its internal affairs, \nwhich “cut[s] against the availability of preliminary injunctions in Government personnel cases.”  \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 84 (1974).  In Sampson, the Supreme Court considered \nwhether a probationary employee at the General Services Administration could receive a \ntemporary restraining order enjoining her dismissal during an administrative appeal to the Civil \nService Commission.  Id. at 62–63.  The Court concluded that, particularly considering the \nGovernment’s prerogative to manage its employees, the loss of wages and reputation that may be \nremedied through further proceedings fell “far short of the type of irreparable injury which is a \nnecessary predicate to the issuance of a temporary injunction in this type of case.”  Id. at 91–92.  \nThe Court nonetheless allowed that a “District Court is not totally without authority to grant \ninterim injunctive relief to a discharged Government employee,” id. at 63, and that relief may be \nappropriate “in the genuinely extraordinary situation,” rather than “in the routine case.”  Id. at 92 \nn.68.\nHarris has established that this case represents a “genuinely extraordinary situation” \nmeriting injunctive relief for a discharged Government employee.  Unlike the probationary \n12 \n\n230a\nemployee in Sampson, Harris was appointed Chairman of a federal agency and confirmed by the \nSenate.4   See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 80–81.  The conditions under which the President may end \nher tenure are made plain by federal statute and supported by ninety years of Supreme Court \nprecedent.  See Dellinger, at *10 (finding Sampson’s “analysis” to be “of little utility” in case of \nemployee terminated despite for-cause removal protections).  Sampson additionally relied on \n“the well-established rule that the Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude \nin the ‘dispatch of its own internal affairs.’” Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (quoting Cafeteria & Rest. \nWorkers Union, Local 473, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 896 (1961)).  Yet that \nconcern is minimized in the context of an action that at this stage appears to be nakedly illegal, \nsuch that the Government’s range of options is necessarily constrained. \nHarris cites Berry v. Reagan, which—although vacated as moot under United States v. \nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950), see 732 F.2d 949—remains instructive here.  See \nPl.’s Mot. at 10–11.  In that case, Congress established “[t]he Commission on Civil Rights [as] a \ntemporary, bipartisan agency” to be “composed of six members, appointed by the President, by \nand with the advice and consent of the Senate.”  Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *1.  The commissioners \nwere to serve for a fixed term set to “expire[] sixty days after submission of [the Commission’s] \nfinal report and recommendations to the President and to Congress.”  Id.  Three years after their \nappointments, President Reagan notified the commissioners of their termination, and they sought \nan injunction.  Id. \n4 Defendants cite numerous cases in which courts have declined to issue injunctive relief \nbased on “the deprivation of a unique, singular, or high-level position.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 11.  \nNone of these cases involved plaintiffs who enjoyed removal protections enacted by Congress \nand signed into law by the President.  Courts have found injunctive relief warranted in such \nsituations.  See Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5; Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *14. \n13 \n\n231a\nThe Berry court proceeded through analysis remarkably similar to that here.  The court \nconsidered whether the Civil Rights Act of 1957 contained a congressional intent to protect the \ncommissioners’ independence under Humphrey’s Executor.  See id. *2–4.  After concluding that \nCongress intended the commissioners to serve for the full life of the Commission, the court \nmoved on to consider irreparable harm.  See id. at *4.  The court then looked to Sampson to \ndetermine if the commissioners’ injuries “override the factors militating against the issuance of \npreliminary relief” in Government personnel actions.  Id. at *5.  The court concluded that the \ninjury was irreparable because denial of preliminary relief would have an “obviously disruptive \neffect” on “the Commission’s final activities.”  Id.  “Moreover,” the court continued, “it is not \nclear that the President has the power to remove Commissioners at his discretion and that he \nshould be given the widest latitude to exercise this authority.”  Id.  In addition, the \ncommissioners did “not have administrative, statutory, or other relief that is readily available to \nmany federal employees.”  Id.5  The court then granted the injunction.  Id. at *6. \nOne Judge in this Circuit recently issued a temporary restraining order under similar \ncircumstances.  See generally Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022.  In that case, the President terminated \nSpecial Counsel Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed to a five-year term to the independent \nOffice of Special Counsel and “may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. at *3 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 1211(b)).  The court concluded \nthat these for-cause removal conditions were likely constitutional.  Id. at *9.  Analyzing the \nirreparable harm, the court also turned to Sampson and Berry, determining that Dellinger “was \nappointed for a fixed term, and he has a statutory mission that his removal has rendered him \n5 The parties do not discuss what administrative relief may be available to Harris here, so \nthe Court does not consider the issue. \n14 \n\n232a\nunable to fulfill.”  Id. at *11.  “[T]he loss of the ability to do what Congress specifically directed \nhim to do cannot be remediated with anything other than equitable relief.”  Id.   \nAt the motion hearing in this case, Defendants argued that Dellinger is incorrect in part \nbecause the court there conflated the notion of an agency’s statutory right to function with what \nthey say is “essentially an employment action.”  But Berry, Dellinger, Humphrey’s Executor, \nand Wiener together make clear that these cases represent far more than grievances over backpay \nand routine personnel issues.  Like the plaintiffs in Berry and Dellinger, Harris was appointed to \nand confirmed as a member of an agency charged with acting with a degree of independence \nfrom the President.  By vindicating their rights to occupy those offices, these plaintiffs act as \nmuch in their own interests as those of their agencies’.6  The Supreme Court in Humphrey’s \nExecutor and Wiener similarly viewed the plaintiffs before them as vindicating the independence \nof their agencies and discussed at length the nature of the President’s power over those agencies \nrather than the narrow issue of unpaid salaries.  See, e.g., Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629 \n(discussing the relative authorities of Congress and the President over independent agencies); \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 353–56 (same).  The plaintiffs in these cases are not low-ranking staff \nmembers at those agencies, either—Dellinger was appointed to lead the Office of Special \nCounsel, and Harris was appointed as one of three members of the MSPB.  Striking at the \nindependence of these officials accrues harm to their offices, as well.  See Berry, 1983 WL 538, \nat *5 (considering the effect on the federal agency of declining to issue an injunction); English v. \nTrump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 335 (D.D.C. 2018) (same). \n6 Indeed, Harris stands before this Court in her personal and official capacities.  See \nCompl. at 1; see also Pl.’s Reply at 4–6, ECF No. 7 (discussing harm to Harris in her official \ncapacity). \n15 \n\n233a\nWith this in mind, the irreparable harm in this case becomes clear.  Were the President \nable to displace independent agency heads from their positions for the length of litigation such as \nthis, those officials’ independence would shatter.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 10 (“Simply put, Congress \nreasonably concluded that the MSPB cannot serve as an independent protector of a merit system \nif the Members are subject at all times to removal without cause by the President.”); Pl.’s Reply \nat 7, ECF No. 7 (“Allowing Ms. Harris’s illegal termination to stand for even a short period \nwould violate the bipartisan, independent nature of the Board.”).  Even if this Court were to \ndirect Harris’s reinstatement after resolving the merits of her claims—a process that can take \nsome time—the MSPB’s congressionally mandated independence would be permanently marred \nby the threat of renewed removal and delayed reinstatement while litigation proceeds.  See \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629–30 (explaining that the “coercive influence” of the \nremoval power “threatens the independence of a commission”).  Harris would reenter the \nposition as a Chairman of the MSPB who had just been removed from her role for a significant \nlength of time, and “the Damocles’ sword of removal by the President,” Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356, \nwould hang over her and her colleagues.  This harm would accrue in the absence of a temporary \nrestraining order, and the passage of time would both cause this damage and preclude a remedy.  \nSee Wisc. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674 (stating that injunctive relief is appropriate when post-hoc \n“legal remedies” are “inadqeua[te]”).  If there ever were an “extraordinary case[]” meriting \ninjunctive relief for a Government employee, Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68, then this would be \nit. \nAssuming that the Defendants’ actions are unlawful, see Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches at 303, Harris additionally suffers irreparable harm because she is at present prevented \nfrom chairing the Board following Senate confirmation to that position, see Pl.’s Mot. at 10–11.  \n16 \n\n234a\nThe Berry court reasoned that “deprivation” of the plaintiff commissioners’ “statutory right to \nfunction as Commissioners” following “their unlawful removal from office by the President” \nrepresented irreparable harm.  1983 WL 538, at *5.  So too did the Special Counsel in Dellinger \nsuffer irreparable harm by the inability to fulfill his “statutory mission” to protect employees \nfrom prohibited personnel practices, such that “the loss of the ability to do what Congress \nspecifically directed him to do cannot be remediated with anything other than equitable relief.”  \nDellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *11.  MSPB members are similarly charged with protecting \nfederal employees from prohibited practices, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204, and subtracting time from \nHarris’s congressionally mandated seven-year term prevents her from carrying out the duties \nCongress has assigned to her.  \nFurthermore, Defendants contend that because Harris has been removed from office and \nseeks to return, she can suffer no injury in her capacity as a member of the MSPB.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’ at 10 (arguing that Harris “seek[s] judicial reinstatement to a principal office”); id. at 11 \n(comparing Harris’s situation to those of government employees lacking tenure protections).  \nThis puts the cart before the horse.  First, assuming that the President lacked the power to \nterminate Harris without cause, then she rightfully remains a Senate-confirmed member of the \nMSPB.  See Humphrey’s Executor at 629 (holding that the removal “power does not extend to an \noffice such as that here involved”).  Defendants thus conflate wrongful termination with the lack \nof power to effectuate termination—at least without cause.  Second, this position fails to \nrecognize that any later reinstatement of Harris would not restore the state of affairs that existed \nprior to her purported termination, given that she would not longer serve as a member of a truly \nindependent agency. \n17 \n\n235a\nDefendants contend that Harris “cites no injury of a kind that the Supreme Court has \nrecognized as irreparable in this context.”  Def.’s Mot. at 11 (citing Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & \nn.6).  They aver that “court after court in this Circuit and others has concluded that loss of \nemployment does not constitute irreparable harm.”  Id.  Indeed, it is “well settled that economic \nloss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.”  Wisc. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.  Yet \ncourts often reach this conclusion based on the notion that a wrongfully discharged employee \nmay be entitled to back pay.  See, e.g., id. (reasoning that “adequate compensatory or other \ncorrective relief [may] be available at a later date”); Sampson, 415 U.S. at 90; Davenport v. Int’l \nBhd. of Teamsters, AFL-CIO, 166 F.3d 356, 367 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Williams v. Walsh, 619 F. \nSupp. 3d 48, 63–64 (D.D.C. 2022).  That is not the issue in this case.  Harris does not seek \ncompensatory damages, but rather complains of injury arising from her inability to occupy a \nposition at an independent agency following her presidential appointment and Senate \nconfirmation.   \nDefendants additionally cite English v. Trump for the notion that “‘any such harm’ to \nPlaintiff coming solely from her not functioning as a Member of the MSPB ‘can be remediated \nin the ordinary course of this case.’”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 12 (quoting English, 279 F. Supp. at 335).  \nIn English, the CFPB Director resigned, he appointed his Deputy to take his place, and an \napparent conflict arose between two statutes governing succession at the agency.  English, 279 F. \nSupp. at 319.  One provision of the Dodd-Frank Act stated that the CFPB Deputy Director would \n“serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the Director.”  Id. (quoting 12 U.S.C. \n§ 5491(b)(5)(B)).  The Federal Vacancy Reform Act (“FVRA”), however, also grants the \nPresident the power to appoint acting officers either from within a federal agency or from a \ndifferent agency if the official is Senate-confirmed.  See id. at 312.  The English court \n18 \n\n236a\ndetermined that the two statutes could be read to avoid a conflict, such that the Dodd-Frank Act \nprovided a default rule that the President may override under the FVRA.  Id. at 319.  Even \nassuming that the Deputy Director were likely to prevail, however, the court found no irreparable \nharm because CFPB would continue to operate, and the Deputy Director never functioned as the \nCFPB’s acting director.  See id. at 334 (distinguishing Berry).   \nEnglish does not guide the outcome here for at least three reasons.  First, Harris was duly \nappointed to her position at the MSPB.  In contrast, the Deputy Director in English was not \nSenate-confirmed to carry out specific duties and never occupied the position of acting Director.  \nSee id. at 335; see also Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *12.  The Deputy Director was instead \ndenied the opportunity to fill a role in the context of a statutory conflict between the Dodd-Frank \nAct and the FVRA, and she was not attempting to preserve the status quo.  See English, 279 F. \nSupp. at 335; see also Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *12.  Second, Harris was terminated from \nher Senate-confirmed position without cause, while the Deputy Director was not fired from any \nposition, much less one from which she could be removed solely for cause.  See English, 279 F. \nSupp. at 313–15.  Finally, Harris’s termination from the MSPB has foreclosed her ability to carry \nout the agency’s mission, whereas the Deputy Director remained in place at the CFPB.  See id. at \n334.7 \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Harris has demonstrated a likelihood that \nshe will experience irreparable harm that cannot be remedied by her reinstatement once the \nmerits have been decided.8 \n7 The parties additionally appeal to Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144 (D.D.C.), to \nsupport their respective positions.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11; Defs.’ Opp’n at 12–13.  Mackie is \ninapplicable here for the reasons articulated in Dellinger.  See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, *11 \nn.6.\n8 The Court does not, at present, find the threat of Harris’s replacement to represent \n19 \n\n237a\nC.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest\nHarris argues that the balance of the equities and public interest weigh in her favor \nbecause the Government’s recent flurry of personnel actions has led to uncertainty that requires \nstability at the MSPB.  Pl.’s Mot. at 12.  Defendants respond that the public interest counsels \nagainst injunctive relief, which would “intru[de] into the President’s authority to exercise ‘all of’ \nthe ‘executive Power’ of the United States.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13–14. \nGiven that federal law limits the conditions under which Harris’s tenure may be \nterminated, Supreme Court precedent supports the constitutionality of those conditions, and \nDefendants do not argue that those conditions were met here, the Court finds that it is in the \npublic interest to issue injunctive relief.  “[T]here is a substantial public interest ‘in having \ngovernmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.’”  \nLeague of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting \nWashington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).  So too is there substantial public \ninterest in the protections from removal Congress has given to certain members of independent \nagencies.  Furthermore, the government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends \nan unlawful practice or reads a statute as required.”  R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 \n(D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013)). \nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris’s Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder is GRANTED; and it is  \nirreparable injury, as she does not establish that the President is “likely” to nominate a \nreplacement “in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis omitted); see \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 13 (citing English, 279 F.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Cathy A. Harris was appointed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) \non June 1, 2022, for a term set to expire on March 1, 2028.  Federal law states that members of \nthe MSPB may be removed from office “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice.”  On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump informed Harris that her position on \nthe MSPB was “terminated, effective immediately” but provided no reason for Harris’s \ntermination.  The following day, Harris filed this lawsuit against President Trump and several \nother federal officials (“Defendants”), claiming that her termination violated federal law.  She \nmoved for a temporary restraining order enjoining Defendants from treating her as removed from \noffice, which this Court granted.  The parties consolidated preliminary injunction briefing with \nthe merits, and Harris moved for summary judgment.  The Court grants that motion, along with \ndeclaratory judgment and a permanent injunction. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 2 of 35\nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \nCongress created the Merit Systems Protection Board as a component of the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978 (“CSRA”), which “establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions \ntaken against federal employees.”  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 44 (2012); see also CSRA, \nPub. L. No. 95-454, § 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121–25 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 1201–05).  \nCongress’s Findings and Statement of Purpose indicate that “[i]t is the policy of the United \nStates that . . . to provide the people of the United States with a competent, honest, and \nproductive Federal work force[,] . . . Federal personnel management should be implemented \nconsistent with merit system principles.”  CSRA § 3, 92 Stat. at 1112.  Those merit system \nprinciples include, among others, “[r]ecruitment . . . from qualified individuals” where “selection \nand advancement [is] determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, \nafter fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.”  Id. § 101, 92 \nStat. at 1113 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301).  Congress additionally instructed that “[e]mployees \nshould be . . . protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan \npolitical purposes,” as well as “against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information which the \nemployees reasonably believe evidences,” among other things, violations of law, gross waste of \nfunds, an abuse of authority, or substantial and specific dangers to public health or safety.  Id., 92 \nStat. at 1114 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301). \nThe CSRA established the MSPB as “an independent agency consisting of three \nmembers” and “charged [it] with protecting the merit system principles and adjudicating \nconflicts between federal workers and their employing agencies.”  Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. \nBd., 672 F.2d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see also CSRA § 101, 92 Stat. at 1114–17 (codified at 5 \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 3 of 35\nU.S.C. § 2302) (establishing prohibited personnel practices, such as employment discrimination, \nunlawful political activities, and any other violations of law within the federal civil service).  The \nBoard’s primary function is to review federal employee appeals of adverse actions “which [are] \nappealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation,” including those related to removal or \nsuspension for periods greater than fourteen days.  5 U.S.C. § 7701(a); see also id. § 1204(a)(1).  \nThese adjudications consume approximately 95 percent of MSPB members’ time.  See Pl.’s \nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts ¶ 54 (“SUMF”), ECF No. 22-2.  The Board may order \nfederal agencies and employees to comply with its decisions, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(2), which \nare nonetheless subject to judicial review.  See id. § 7703.  The MSPB thus acts as a preliminary \nadjudicator of these employment disputes, with federal courts providing the final say if the \nparties so desire. \nThe MSPB carries out other limited tasks in pursuit of its mission.  It conducts studies \n“relating to the civil service” for the President and Congress, see 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(3), although \nthis function takes up less than one percent of members’ time, see SUMF ¶ 62.  The Board may \nalso review “rules and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management,” see id. § 1204(a)(4), \non its own motion, following a complaint from the Special Counsel, or in response to a third \nparty’s petition, see id. § 1204(f)(1).  The MSPB may invalidate the rule or its implementation if \nit would require a federal employee to engage in prohibited personnel practices.  See id. \n§ 1204(f)(2).1   \nMembers of the MSPB are “appointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate,” and “not more than 2 of [the members] may be adherents of the same \n \n1 Harris explains that invalidation of an Office of Personnel Management rule under this \nmechanism “is an exceedingly rare occurrence” that has not happened during her tenure.  Harris \nDecl. ¶ 31, ECF No. 22-3. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 4 of 35\npolitical party.”  CSRA § 202 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1201).  Members of the MSPB are \nappointed to seven-year terms that may be extended by up to one year if a successor has not yet \nbeen appointed.  Id. (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 1202(a)–(c)).  “Any member may be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  Id. (codified at 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202(d)). \nB.  Factual and Procedural Background \nPresident Joseph R. Biden nominated Harris to be a member of the MSPB in January \n2022.  SUMF ¶ 1.  The Senate confirmed her on May 25, 2022, and she was sworn in on June 1, \n2022.  Id. ¶ 2.  Her term expires on March 1, 2028.  Id. ¶ 3.  The Senate later confirmed Harris as \nChairman, and she was sworn in as Chairman on March 14, 2024.  Id. ¶¶ 4–5.   \nDefendants do not dispute that Harris has been efficient and effective in her role at the \nMSPB.  See id. ¶ 8.  When the MSPB’s quorum was restored in March 2022, the agency had a \nbacklog of approximately 3,800 cases that had accrued since 2017, and officials estimated that it \nwould take five or six years for the agency to catch up.  Id. ¶¶ 12–14.  By January 2025, \nhowever, the MSPB had cleared nearly 99 percent of its backlog.  Id. ¶ 20.  From June 1, 2022, \nto February 10, 2025, Harris participated in nearly 4,500 decisions.  Id. ¶ 10.   \nOn February 10, 2025, Harris received an email from Trent Morse, Deputy Assistant to \nthe President and the Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, which \nstated in its entirety: \nOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your \nposition on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective \nimmediately. Thank you for your service[.] \nEx. 4 to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and J. on the Merits, ECF No. 22-4.  The communication did \nnot explain the basis for Harris’s termination. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 5 of 35\n  Harris filed this lawsuit on February 11, 2025, claiming that her firing was ultra vires, \nunconstitutional, and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  See Compl. \n¶¶ 31–37, 40–41, ECF No. 1.  She seeks relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, issuance of a \nwrit of mandamus, and equitable relief.  See id. ¶¶ 38–39, 42–46.  Harris additionally filed a \nmotion for a temporary restraining order, see Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 2, which Defendants \nopposed, see Defs.’ Opp’n to Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 6.  The Court held a hearing on the TRO \nmotion on February 13, 2025, and granted the motion on February 18, 2025.  See Min. Entry \ndated Feb. 13, 2025; Order Granting Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, ECF No. 8; Mem. Op. Granting Pl.’s \nMot. for TRO (“Mem. Op.”), ECF No. 9.  Defendants appealed that order to the D.C. Circuit, \nand the appeal remains pending.  See Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 15. \n  On February 19, 2025, the parties filed a joint status report indicating that the Court’s \nconsideration of the subsequent motion for preliminary injunction should be consolidated with \nthe merits of the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).  See Joint Status \nReport, ECF No. 13.  On February 23, 2025, Harris filed a motion for a preliminary injunction \nand judgment on the merits.  See Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and J. on the Merits (“Pl.’s Mot.”), \nECF No. 22.  Defendants opposed the motion, see Defs.’ Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and \nJ. on the Merits (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 33, and Harris filed a reply, see Defs.’ Reply, ECF \nNo. 38.  The parties appeared for a hearing before the Court on March 3, 2025. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n“Having granted consolidation under Rule 65(a)(2), the Court ‘treats the parties’ briefing \nas cross-motions for summary judgment.’”  Penkoski v. Bowser, 486 F. Supp. 3d 219, 226 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Trump v. Comm. on Oversight & Reform of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, 380 F. Supp. 3d 76, 90 (D.D.C. 2019)).  “The court shall grant summary \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 6 of 35\njudgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A dispute is genuine if \n“the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury.”  Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251–52 (1986).  And a fact is material if it “might affect the \noutcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Id. at 248.  On summary judgment, the Court \nviews all evidence “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and . . . must draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.”  Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \nThe principal purpose of summary judgment is to streamline litigation by disposing of \nfactually unsupported claims or defenses and determining whether there is a genuine need for \ntrial.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–24 (1986).  The movant bears the initial \nburden of identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  In response, the non-\nmovant must point to specific facts in the record that reveal a genuine issue that is suitable for \ntrial.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.  In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court must \n“eschew making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence[,]” Czekalski v. Peters, 475 \nF.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and all underlying facts and inferences must be analyzed in the \nlight most favorable to the non-movant, see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.  Nevertheless, \nconclusory assertions offered without any evidentiary support do not establish a genuine issue \nfor trial.  See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).   \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nThe Court first considers the constitutionality of the MSPB’s structure, concluding that \nits members’ for-cause removal protections are constitutional under Humphrey’s Executor.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 7 of 35\nFederal law thus prevents the President from removing members of the MSPB without cause, \nand the President’s attempt to terminate Harris was unlawful.  As such, Harris is entitled to \nsummary judgment.  The Court next determines the remedies to which Harris may be entitled, \ngranting her declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction.  To the extent that injunctive \nrelief may be unavailable, the Court would grant mandamus relief in the alternative. \nA.  Constitutionality of the MSPB Members’ Removal Protections \nHarris claims that her termination was ultra vires in violation of statutory authority, \nviolated the separation of powers, and was contrary to law under the APA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 31–\n37, 40–41.  She argues that this case falls squarely within the heartland of Humphrey’s Executor \nv. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and its progeny, and that the Board is a traditional \nmultimember body that does not wield traditional executive power.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11–20.  \nMSPB members’ removal protections are therefore constitutional, according to Harris.  See id. at \n11–12.  Defendants respond that the MSPB does not fall within Humphrey’s Executor, and that \nthe independent agency wields substantial executive power.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 5–13.  The \nCourt concludes that MSPB members’ removal protections are constitutional under Humphrey’s \nExecutor and must be upheld here. \nIn Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court upheld a statutory provision identical to the \none at issue here restricting removal of Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) members.  See \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619–20 (discussing 15 U.S.C. § 41); 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).  The \nFTC comprises five members “appointed by the President[,] by and with the advice and consent \nof the Senate,” and “[n]ot more than three of the commissioners shall be members of the same \npolitical party.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619–20 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41).  “Any \nCommissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 8 of 35\nin office.”  Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41).  In Humphrey’s Executor, President Hoover had \nappointed William Humphrey as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, which carried a \nterm of seven years.  295 U.S. at 612.  Less than two years later, President Roosevelt terminated \nHumphrey over differences of political opinion, stating, “[e]ffective as of this date you are \nhereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.”  Id. at 619.  \nHumphrey died several months later, but his estate sued to recover backpay on the basis that his \nremoval was unlawful.  Id. at 612. \nThe Supreme Court confirmed that President Roosevelt’s termination of Humphrey was \nindeed unlawful.  The Court observed that “[t]he statute fixes a term of office, in accordance \nwith many precedents.”  Id. at 623.  The Court further explained that the commission comprised \na “nonpartisan” “body of experts” that was intended to “act with entire impartiality.”  Id. at 624.  \nIt was “charged with the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law” and acted in a \nmanner that was “predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative” rather than traditionally \n“political []or executive” in nature.  Id.  The Court differentiated FTC members from the \npostmaster in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) (evaluating statute stating that \npostmasters “shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended \naccording to law”).  “A postmaster is an executive officer restricted to the performance of \nexecutive functions” and is “charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial \npower.”  Id. at 627.  The FTC, in contrast, “acts in part quasi legislatively and in part quasi \njudicially” rather than exercising traditional executive powers.  Id. at 628.  “We think it plain \nunder the Constitution that illimitable power of removal is not possessed by the President in \nrespect of officers of the character of those just named,” the Court concluded.  Id. at 629.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 9 of 35\nTwo decades later, the Court considered President Eisenhower’s removal of a member of \nthe War Claims Commission, whom President Truman had appointed and the Senate had \nconfirmed.  See Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958).  Congress charged that \ncommission with processing “claims for compensating internees, prisoners of war, and religious \norganizations . . . who suffered personal injury or property damage at the hands of the enemy in \nconnection with World War II,” and the commissioners’ terms were limited by the short duration \nof the commission’s existence.  Id.  The Court reasoned that Congress intended to “preclude[] \nthe President from influencing the Commission in passing on a particular claim,” which meant \nthat the President naturally could not “hang . . . the Damocles’ sword of removal” over the \ncommissioners.  Id. at 356.  The Court reaffirmed that the President had “no such power” to \n“remove a member of an adjudicatory body like the War Claims Commission merely because he \nwanted his own appointees on such a Commission.”  Id.2 \nIn two more recent cases, however, the Supreme Court ruled that for-cause removal \nprovisions applying to independent agencies with a single director violated the separation of \npowers.  See Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 218 \n(2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021).  Neither of those cases undermines the \n \n2 The Court once again considered a multimember body in Mistretta v. United States \nwhen passing on the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing Commission, which \nformally resides in the Judiciary.  488 U.S. 361 (1989).  The Sentencing Report Act of 1984 \nempowered the President to appoint commissioners to the Sentencing Commission, with \nmembers “subject to removal by the President ‘only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \nor for other good cause shown.’”  Id. at 368 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 991(a)).  When considering \nwhether the Act affords the President undue influence over federal judges who served as \ncommissioners, the Court recognized that “the President’s removal power under the Act is \nlimited.”  Id. at 410.  “Such congressional limitation on the President’s removal power, like the \nremoval provisions upheld in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and Humphrey’s Executor \n. . . , is specifically crafted to prevent the President from exercising ‘coercive influence’ over \nindependent agencies.”  Id. at 410–411. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 10 of 35\nconstitutionality of for-cause removal provisions for multimember bodies of experts heading an \nindependent agency.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 228 (“[W]e do not revisit Humphrey’s Executor \nor any other precedent today.”). \n“Rather than create a traditional independent agency headed by a multimember board or \ncommission, Congress elected to place the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”)] \nunder the leadership of a single Director.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207.  In Seila Law, the Court \nobserved that “[a]n agency with a structure like that of the CFPB is almost wholly \nunprecedented.”  Id. as 220; see also id. at 220–22 (searching for historical precedent to support \nthe CFPB’s structure).  The Court further concluded that “[t]he CFPB’s single-Director \nstructure” contravenes the separation of powers “by vesting significant governmental power in \nthe hands of a single individual accountable to no one,” emphasizing that the director may act \n“unilaterally” and “[w]ith no colleagues to persuade.”  Id. at 224–25.  Two other features of the \nCFPB undermined the constitutionality of the agency’s structure.  First, the director’s five-year \nterm meant that “some Presidents may not have any opportunity to shape [the agency’s] \nleadership and thereby influence its activities.”  Id. at 225.  Second, “[t]he CFPB’s receipt of \nfunds outside the appropriations process further aggravates the agency’s threat to Presidential \ncontrol.”  Id. at 226.  For these reasons, the Court concluded that the CFPB’s structure violated \nthe separation of powers.  See id. at 232.   \nNone of the reasoning in Seila Law undermined the constitutionality of the traditional \nindependent agency structure outlined in Humphrey’s Executor.  See id. at 218 (describing \n“exception[]” for “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power”).  \nRather, the Court’s reasoning reaffirmed the constitutionality of multimember boards with for-\ncause removal protections, as those agencies have a robust basis in this country’s history, and \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 11 of 35\ntheir members lack the power to act unilaterally.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 11 (emphasizing that \nCongress established the first such board in 1887).  The Court’s rationale also relied on the \nCFPB’s divergence from traditional agency structures when finding the for-cause removal \nprotections unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 205–07 (emphasizing facts \nshowing drift from Elizabeth Warren’s initial proposal for multimember board to Congress’s \nenactment of single-headed agency).  The Court even opined that Congress could fix the problem \nby “for example, converting the CFPB into a multimember agency.”  Id. at 237. \nCollins then represented a “straightforward application” of the Court’s “reasoning in \nSeila Law” to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”).  594 U.S. at 251; see also Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 222 (noting doubt as to the constitutionality of the FHFA’s structure).  \nSimilarly to the CFPB, the FHFA was “an agency led by a single Director” that “lack[ed] a \nfoundation in historical practice and clashe[d] with constitutional structure by concentrating \npower in a unilateral actor insulated from Presidential control.”  594 U.S. at 251. \nHumphrey’s Executor thus remains alive and well, and it dictates the outcome here.  The \nMSPB is “a traditional independent agency headed by a multimember board or commission,” \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 207, and as such Congress may grant the Board’s members for-cause \nremoval protections.  The MSPB is “a multimember body of experts” that is “balanced along \npartisan lines.”  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216; see also Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624 \n(noting that the FTC is a “nonpartisan” “body of experts” that was intended to “act with entire \nimpartiality”).  The CSRA envisions that the Board “is to be nonpartisan; and it must, from the \nvery nature of its duties, act with entire impartiality.”  Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624.  \nThe CSRA also “fixes a term of office.”  Id. at 623.  The Board’s members serve on overlapping, \nstaggered seven-year terms, meaning that the President will have the “opportunity to shape [the \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 12 of 35\nMSPB’s] leadership and thereby influence its activities.” 3  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  The \nmembers’ staggered terms permit them to “accumulate[] expertise” in the operation of federal \nagencies and federal employment law.  Id. at 218.  The MSPB’s duties are “quasi judicial,” \nHumphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 624, in that it conducts preliminary adjudications of federal \nemployees’ claims, which may then be appealed to Article III courts.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7703 \n(providing for review in the Federal Circuit); Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 582 U.S. 420, 423 \n(2017) (providing for review of mixed cases in district court).  The MSPB’s rulemaking \nauthority is limited to “regulations . . . necessary for the performance of its functions.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(h).  Congress further intended the agency to aid its legislative goals by regularly \ntransmitting reports to Congress regarding the Board’s functions.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204(l), 1205.  \nIt is additionally evident that Congress hoped to “preclude[] the President from influencing the \n[Board] in passing on a particular claim.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  The MSPB nonetheless \nremains politically accountable to both Congress and the President through the appropriations \nprocess in a manner inapplicable to independent agencies with their own funding sources, such \nas the CFPB and FHFA.  See Selia Law, 591 U.S. at 226; Collins, 594 U.S. at 231. \nThe MSPB also “do[es] not wield substantial executive power,” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n218, but rather spends nearly all of its time adjudicating “inward-facing personnel matters” \ninvolving federal employees, Pl.’s Mot. at 4.  The Board does not regulate the conduct of private \nparties, nor does it possess its own rulemaking authority except in furtherance of its judicial \nfunctions.  See id. at 12.  It cannot initiate its own personnel cases, but must instead “passively \n \n3 One MSPB member’s term has now expired, and Harris’s term expires on March 1, \n2028.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 29 n.20; Pl.’s Reply at 13–14; SUMF ¶ 3.  President Trump will \ntherefore have the opportunity to appoint at least two members to the MSPB during his term in \noffice. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 13 of 35\nwait for them to be brought.”  Id. at 12; see also 5 U.S.C. § 1204 (defining the Board’s powers \nand functions).  Harris additionally points out that the MSPB preserves power within the \nexecutive branch by charging presidentially appointed Board members with mediation and initial \nadjudication of federal employment disputes, rather than shifting those decisions to Article III \ncourts in the first instance.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 14.   \nSeveral other features of the MSPB demonstrate its limited effects on the President’s \npowers.  The MSPB’s jurisdiction is generally restricted to civil servants and does not include \npolitical appointees.4  See 5 U.S.C. § 7511.  Even among civil servants, members of the Senior \nExecutive Service removed “for less than fully successful executive performance” are entitled \nonly to an informal hearing before the Board.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3592(a).  Furthermore, the MSPB’s \ndecisions are generally not the final word.  Federal employees may appeal the Board’s decisions \nto Article III courts, see 5 U.S.C. § 7703(a), and the Director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement may similarly seek review of any decision that he determines “will have a \nsubstantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive,” id. § 7703(d)(1)–\n(2).   \nFinally, the MSPB’s mission and purpose require independence.  In enacting the CSRA, \nCongress exercised its power to regulate the civil service, defining certain prohibited personnel \npractices, to include discrimination, loyalty oaths, coercion to engage in political activity, and \nretaliation against whistleblowers.  See 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1)–(3), (8).  Direct political control \nover the MSPB would have limited effect on the President’s implementation of his policy \nagenda.  It would instead neuter the CSRA’s statutory scheme by allowing high-ranking \n \n4 Nor may the Board review the merits of determinations concerning an employee’s \neligibility to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security.  See Kaplan v. \nConyers, 733 F.3d 1148, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2013).   \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 14 of 35\ngovernment officials to engage in prohibited practices and then pressure the MSPB into inaction.  \nThe MSPB’s independence is therefore structurally inseparable from the CSRA itself.  These \nduties dovetail with United States v. Perkins, in which the Supreme Court held that Congress \nmay “limit, restrict, and regulate the removal” of inferior officers.  116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886).  \nDenying independence to the Board would undermine these constitutionally sound limitations on \nthe removal of civil servants. \nDefendants cannot argue that Humphrey’s Executor has been overturned, so they instead \nsuggest that even if the MSPB is a traditional multimember agency, it wields “‘substantial’ \nexecutive power” in a manner found significant in Seila Law.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 (quoting Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 218).  Yet the Supreme Court has clarified that it did not mean Humphrey’s \nExecutor to exclude removal protections for any official exercising authority within the \nexecutive branch.  See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 688–89 (1988); see also Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 216 (detailing “several organizational features that helped explain” the Humphrey’s \nExecutor court’s “characterization of the FTC as non-executive”).  There is instead a “spectrum” \nthat runs from “‘purely executive’ officials who must be removable by the President at will if he \nis to be able to accomplish his constitutional role” and those who serve “‘quasi-legislative’ or \n‘quasi-judicial’” roles, where the President’s control is not “so central to the functioning of the \nExecutive Branch” as to require the President to be able to terminate the official at will.  \nMorrison, 487 U.S. at 690–91.  As the Court explained above, the Board’s duties—which \nprimarily include adjudication of employment claims—do not represent “substantial” executive \npower and instead take on a quasi-judicial role.  Furthermore, the MSPB’s powers are no more \nexpansive than the FTC’s functions upheld in Humphrey’s Executor, which remains good law.  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 15 of 35\nSeveral courts have deployed similar reasoning when rejecting challenges to the \nstructures of traditional multimember agencies in the years since Seila Law and Collins.  Last \nyear, the Fifth Circuit upheld the structure of the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n(“CPSC”), concluding that the agency is “a prototypical ‘traditional independent agency, run by \na multimember board,’” is not directed by a single individual, and that the President may \ninfluence its activities through appointments or the appropriations process.  Consumers’ Rsch. v. \nConsumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 91 F.4th 342, 354–55 (5th Cir. 2024), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct. \n414, 170 (2024).  The Tenth Circuit turned away a comparable challenge to the agency, \nreasoning that Humphrey’s Executor remains good law, that the CPSC is structured similarly to \nthe FTC, and that limited civil and criminal enforcement powers do not undermine the \nconstitutionality of its tenure protections.  Leachco, Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 103 \nF.4th 748, 762 (10th Cir. 2024), cert. denied, No. 24-156, 2025 WL 76435 (U.S. Jan. 13, 2025).  \nCourts have additionally found the FTC’s structure constitutionally sound because the Supreme \nCourt has not revisited Humphrey’s Executor.  See Illumina, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 88 \nF.4th 1036, 1047 (5th Cir. 2023); Meta Platforms, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 723 F. Supp. 3d \n64, 87 (D.D.C. 2024).  This Court, likewise, cannot reach a different outcome regarding the \nMSPB. \nBecause the MSPB falls within the scope of Humphrey’s Executor, Congress has the \npower to specify that members of the MSPB may serve for a term of years, with the President \nempowered to remove those members only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice.  The President thus lacks the power to remove Harris from office at will.  Because the \nPresident did not indicate that he sought to remove Harris for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 16 of 35\nmalfeasance in office, his attempt to terminate her was unlawful and exceeded the scope of his \nauthority.5 \nB.  Remedy \nWith the merits aside, the Court turns to the question of remedy.  Harris offers up three \navenues for relief: declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and a writ of mandamus.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 38–39, 42–44, 45–46; Pl.’s Mot. at 27–36.  The Court concludes that because any \nattempt to remove Harris is unlawful, she is entitled to declaratory judgment that she remains a \nproperly appointed member of the MSPB.  The Court additionally determines that Harris has met \nher burden for the permanent injunction she seeks, and that a writ of mandamus would be \nappropriate if such injunctive relief were unavailable. \n1.  Declaratory Judgment \nThe Declaratory Judgment Act provides that, “[i]n a case of actual controversy within its \njurisdiction . . . any court of the United States . . . may declare the rights and other legal relations \nof any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be \nsought.”  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).  It provides neither jurisdiction nor a cause of action, but rather a \nform of relief when the case is already properly before the Court.  See C&E Servs., Inc. of \nWashington v. D.C. Water & Sewer Autho., 310 F.3d 197, 201 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Glenn v. \nThomas Fortune Fay, 222 F. Supp. 3d 31, 35 (D.D.C. 2016).  The Article III case-or-controversy \nrequirement “is no less strict when a party is seeking a declaratory judgment than for any other \n \n5 The parties do not debate the cause of action through which this legal challenge must \nflow—whether it be the APA, an ultra vires claim, or a separation of powers claim.  These \ndistinctions can be meaningful.  See, e.g., Lewis v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 743 F. Supp. 3d 181, \n199–201 (D.D.C. 2024) (examining the compatibility of an APA and ultra vires claim).  The \nCourt does not interpret this issue to be jurisdictional, however, and does not address an question \nthe parties themselves declined to raise. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 17 of 35\nrelief.”  Fed. Express Corp. v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, 67 F.3d 961, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing \nAltvater v. Freeman, 319 U.S. 359, 363 (1943)).  To establish that a matter is a “controversy” \nwithin the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III of the Constitution, a party \n“must ‘show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal \ninterests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.’”  \nHoffman v. Dist. of Columbia, 643 F. Supp. 2d 132, 140 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Md. Cas. Co. v. \nPac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941)).   \n“[A] declaratory judgment always rests within the sound discretion of the court,” \nPresident v. Vance, 627 F.2d 353, 365 n.76 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (citing Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. \nof America, 316 U.S. 491, 494 (1942)), and “[t]here are no dispositive factors a district court \nshould consider in determining whether it should entertain an action brought under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act.” New York v. Biden, 636 F. Supp. 3d 1, 31 (D.D.C. 2022) (quoting \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. FTC, 894 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (D.D.C. 2012)).  Several factors may be \nhelpful to the Court’s consideration of “the propriety of granting a declaratory judgment,” \nhowever, such as “whether it would finally settle the controversy between the parties”; “whether \nother remedies are available or other proceedings pending”; and “the public importance of the \nquestion to be decided.”  Hanes Corp. v. Millard, 531 F.2d 585, 592 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1976).  The \nCourt might also consider “1) whether the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying the \nlegal relations at issue, or 2) whether the judgment will terminate and afford relief from the \nuncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”  Glenn, 222 F. Supp. 3d \nat 36 (citing President, 627 F.2d at 365 n.76).   \nFirst, the Court finds a “controversy” here within the meaning of the Declaratory \nJudgment Act.  The parties place before the Court a “substantial controversy” over the \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 18 of 35\nlawfulness of the President’s effort to terminate Harris without cause, and whether she remains a \nmember of the MSPB.  Hoffman, 643 F. Supp. 2d at 140; see also Pl.’s Mot. at 11–26; Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 5–13.  The parties have adverse legal interests, with Defendants arguing that the \nPresident has a power that Harris claims he does not.  See, e.g., Defs.’ Opp’n at 5 (arguing that \nthe President’s removal power over principal officers is absolute).  This controversy is also “of \nsufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.”  Hoffman, \n643 F. Supp. 2d at 140.  The controversy here is not based, for instance, on “the occurrence of a \nfuture or contingent event,” but has rather come to a head after the President attempted to \nterminate Harris.  C.F. Folks, Ltd. v. DC Jefferson Bldg., LLC, 308 F. Supp. 3d 145, 150 (D.D.C. \n2018). \nThe Court additionally finds that declaratory relief is appropriate here.  A declaratory \n“judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations” between Harris and \nDefendants and abate ongoing “uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy” over her status as a \nmember of the MSPB.  Glenn, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 36.  The question is also one of significant \n“public importance,” Hanes Corp., 531 F.2d at 592 n.4, given that it concerns the structure and \nindependence of a federal agency.  Although “other remedies” may be available, id., declaratory \njudgment remains appropriate to clarify Harris’s legal status, particularly given the complexity of \ninjunctive relief in this area.  In addition, the Declaratory Judgment Act grants authority to enter \ndeclaratory judgment “whether or not further relief is or could be sought.”  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \nDefendants argue that the Court cannot issue declaratory judgment because it cannot \nenjoin the President.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 21–22 (citing Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70 \n(1971)).  First, the declaratory judgment here clarifies not just the President’s legal relationship \nwith MSPB members, but also subordinate officials’ legal rights and duties.  Second, the \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 19 of 35\nSupreme Court clarified in Samuels that it did “not mean to suggest that a declaratory judgment \nshould never be issued in cases of this type if it has been concluded that injunctive relief would \nbe improper.”  Samuels, 401 U.S. at 73.  “There may be unusual circumstances in which an \ninjunction might be withheld because, despite a plaintiff’s strong claim for relief under the \nestablished standards, the injunctive remedy seemed particularly intrusive or offensive.”  Id.  \n“[I]n such a situation, a declaratory judgment might be appropriate and might not be contrary to \nthe basic equitable doctrines governing the availability of relief.”  Id.  Courts withhold injunctive \nrelief against the President precisely because it is considered “particularly intrusive or \noffensive,” and declaratory judgment remains warranted here given Harris’s “strong claim for \nrelief under the established standards.”  Id.  Defendants additionally cite no controlling authority \nfor the notion that declaratory judgment may not clarify the legal relationship between the \nPresident and other parties.  To the contrary, appellate courts have previously affirmed the \nissuance of declaratory relief involving the President.  See Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, \n492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (considering declaratory judgment to be a less drastic remedy \nthan a writ of mandamus); see also Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 421 (1998) \n(affirming declaratory judgment that the President’s actions under Line Item Veto Act were \ninvalid). \nFor these reasons, the Court enters declaratory judgment in this case clarifying that Harris \nremains a member of the MSPB, and that she may not be removed from her position absent \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. \n2.  Permanent Injunction \nHarris additionally seeks a permanent injunction barring several officials—not including \nthe President—from removing her or treating her as removed.  See Compl. ¶¶ 45–46; Pl.’s Mot. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 20 of 35\nat 28–30; Pl.’s Proposed Order, ECF No. 22-1.  Defendants argue that Harris is not entitled to an \ninjunction because the Court lacks the power to issue equitable relief “reinstating” an officer \nremoved by the President.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 14–18.  Defendants also contend that Harris has not \nsuffered an irreparable injury and that the balance of the equities weigh in their favor.  See id. at \n18–21.  The Court must therefore examine its power to issue equitable relief here before it \nconsiders whether to issue that relief. \na.  Availability of Injunctive Relief  \nDefendants argue that Harris’s remedy must be limited to backpay, and that an injunction \nis inappropriate because that relief was not “traditionally accorded by courts of equity” to \nremedy an official’s wrongful removal from office.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 14 (quoting Grupo \nMexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999)).  Plaintiff \nresponds that federal courts have long granted injunctive relief reinstating federal employees, \nand that mandamus should be available in the alternative.  See Pl.’s Reply at 10–19. \nIn Grupo Mexicano, the Supreme Court considered whether “a United States District \nCourt has the power to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the [debtor] defendant from \ntransferring assets in which no lien or equitable interest is claimed.”  527 U.S. at 310.  The Court \nexplained that “equity is flexible; but in the federal system, at least, that flexibility is confined \nwithin the broad boundaries of traditional equitable relief.”  Id. at 322.  “[E]quity jurisdiction of \nthe federal courts is the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court of Chancery in \nEngland at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the enactment of the original \nJudiciary Act, 1789 (1 Stat. 73).”  Id. at 318 (quoting A. Dobie, Handbook of Federal \nJurisdiction and Procedure 660 (1928)).  The Court concluded that because the Court of \nChancery lacked “an equitable power to restrict a debtor’s use of his unencumbered property \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 21 of 35\nbefore judgment,” a contemporary federal court lacks that power as well.  Id. at 322; see also id. \nat 319–20.  Defendants similarly reason that because the Court of Chancery did not issue \ninjunctions returning public officials to their offices, this Court cannot either.  See Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 14–15.  That contention stumbles, however, for at least two reasons. \nThe first is on-point Supreme Court guidance.  In Sampson v. Murray, the Supreme Court \nconsidered whether a probationary employee at the General Services Administration could \nreceive a temporary restraining order enjoining her dismissal during an administrative appeal to \nthe Civil Service Commission.  415 U.S. 61, 62–63 (1974).  The Court explained that a district \ncourt has “authority to grant interim injunctive relief to a discharged Government employee,” id. \nat 63, but that the plaintiff before the Court did not make the elevated “showing of irreparable \ninjury sufficient in kind and degree to override” the Government’s usual autonomy over its \ninternal affairs, id. at 84.  Loss of wages and reputation could be remedied through further \nproceedings and was not enough to warrant injunctive relief for a federal employee, see id. at \n91–92, but that relief may be appropriate “in the genuinely extraordinary situation,” rather than \n“in the routine case.”  Id. at 92 n.68.  The Court specifically addressed White v. Berry, in which \nthe Supreme Court reasoned that “a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and \nremoval of public officers.”  171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 \n(1888)).  The Sampson Court asserted that “[m]uch water has flowed over the dam since 1898,” \nand that subsequent cases had recognized that federal courts are generally empowered to review \nthe claims of discharged federal employees.  Sampson, 415 U.S. 71–72 (citing Service v. Dulles, \n354 U.S. 363 (1957)); see also Kloeckner, 568 U.S. at 44–46 (discussing remedies for federal \nemployee under the CSRA, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967); Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 22 (2012) \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 22 of 35\n(listing “reinstatement” as among “the kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers” courts to \nprovide).  Harris’s situation is additionally akin to that of the Sampson plaintiff because there is a \nfederal standard to which Harris’s hiring and firing must adhere, and one that the Court must \nenforce.  Sampson thus instructs that equitable relief is available to Harris if she can show that \nher termination represents a “genuinely extraordinary situation,” rather than a “routine case.”  \nSampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68.6  Sampson is not unique; the Supreme Court has repeatedly \ndetermined that plaintiff federal employees were entitled to reinstatement after termination \nviolated their legal rights.  See Service, 354 U.S. at 388–89; Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, \n546 (1959); see also Miller v. Clinton, 687 F.3d 1332, 1360 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting) (explaining that for a federal employee experiencing “unconstitutional \ndiscrimination, equitable relief could include an injunction prior to termination or reinstatement \nsubsequent to termination”). \nThe D.C. Circuit has also found injunctive relief against subordinate federal officials to \nbe available to restore presidential appointees to their offices, although the Government did not \nraise the scope of historical equitable relief in those cases.  See Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, \n976–81 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042–43 (D.C. Cir. 2023).7  In Swan, \nthe six-year term of a member of the Board of the National Credit Union Administration \n(“NCUA”) had expired, but he remained in office because the relevant statute allowed members \nto serve until their successors had qualified.  Swan, 100 F.3d at 975–76.  President Clinton \n \n6 There can additionally be no dispute that federal courts may grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \nInc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015) (citing Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, \n110 (1902)).   \n7 Cases before other courts add further evidence that this power exists.  See Pl.’s Reply at \n11–12 (collecting cases). \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 23 of 35\nremoved the board member, who then sued seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction \nordering his reinstatement.  See id.  The court assessed the board member’s standing to bring the \ncase, focusing on whether his claims were judicially redressable.  Id. at 976–81.  The court was \nuncertain of its power to enjoin the President himself from removing the plaintiff from office, see \nid. at 977–78, but reasoned that it could instead “ensure the rule of law” by issuing “injunctive \nrelief against subordinate officials” effectuating his reinstatement “de facto by” requiring his \ncolleagues to treat him “as a member of the NCUA Board and allowing him to exercise the \nprivileges of that office,” id. at 978, 980.  This encompassed, for instance, “including [the \nplaintiff official] in Board meetings, giving him access to his former office, recording his votes \nas official votes of a Board member, allowing him to draw the salary of a Board member etc.”8   \nId. at 980.  The Circuit reprised this analysis in Severino, in which President Biden removed a \nmember of the Administrative Conference of the United States Council, see Severino, 71 F.4th at \n1041, and the plaintiff had standing because a court could “enjoin ‘subordinate executive \nofficials’ to reinstate a wrongly terminated official ‘de facto,’ even without a formal presidential \nreappointment,” id. at 1042–43 (quoting Swan, 100 F.3d at 980).9 \nSecond, it is also clear that even if Sampson, Swan, and Severino did not make equitable \nrelief available to Harris in a “genuinely extraordinary situation,” she would nonetheless be \nentitled to a writ of mandamus—which is a remedy at law.  See Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. D.C. \n \n8 The Circuit ultimately concluded that the board member’s claim failed on the merits \nbecause, even assuming that NCUA board members had removal protections, holdover members \nwould be entitled to no such protection.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 983–88. \n9 Defendants argue that these cases are not on point because the courts there were \nconsidering the redressability of the plaintiffs’ claims when evaluating their standing.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 16; Swan, 100 F.3d 976–81; Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042–43.  Yet the Circuit’s reasoning \nis no mere dicta, as a federal court must determine that it has the power to grant effective relief \nbefore assuming jurisdiction over a case.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–\n61 (1992). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 24 of 35\n310, 319–21 (D.C. Cir. 1914) (collecting cases); see also Pl.’s Reply at 15–16 (collecting \nsources).  To the extent that English equity courts declined to issue injunctions reinstating \nofficials to their positions, they likely did so because the King’s Bench, a court of law, would \nreadily issue mandamus instead.  See Walkley v. City of Muscatine, 73 U.S. 481, 483–84 (1867) \n(explaining, relying on English cases, that “a court of equity is invoked” only where “a court of \nlaw . . . is inadequate to afford the proper remedy”); Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton & \nWoolen Co., 67 U.S. 545, 550–51 (1862) (similar).  English courts around the time of the \nfounding recognized this power and exercised it regularly.  See, e.g., R. v. Mayor of London, 100 \nEng. Rep. 96, 98 (1787) (recognizing power to issue mandamus reinstating public official);10 R. \nv. Mayor and Aldermen of Doncaster (1752), 96 Eng. Rep. 795 (restoring municipal official to \nhis office after removal by town council); R. v. Mayor, Bailiffs, and Common Council of the \nTown of Liverpool (1759), 97 Eng. Rep. 533 (same);11 R. v. Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of \nDoncaster (1729), 92 Eng. Rep. 513 (same); 73 Eng. Rep. at 752 (discussing Thompson v. \nEdmonds, in which the King’s Bench restored a bailiff to his office because he “was removed” \nby the mayor “without cause”); R. v. Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of Gloucester, 90 \nEng. Rep. 1148 (restoring official to office of capital burgess).  Numerous treatises further \nconfirm this practice.  See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *264–265 (“The writ of mandamus is \n. . . a most full and effective remedy, in the first place, for refusal of admission where a person is \nentitled to an office or place in any such [municipal] corporation; and, secondly, for wrongful \n \n10 During this case, respected trial lawyer Thomas Erskine explained that “[w]henever a \nperson is improperly suspended or removed from an office, whether it concern public or private \nduties, if he has a certain term in it, and there are profits annexed to it, and the party has no other \nspecific legal remedy, the Court will grant mandamus to restore him.”  100 Eng. Rep. at 97. \n11 Here, Lord Mansfield explained that when officials respond to an action for \nmandamus, “the return must set out all the necessary facts, precisely; to shew that the person is \nremoved in legal and proper manner, and for a legal cause.”  97 Eng. Rep. at 537. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 25 of 35\nremoval, when a person is legally possessed.”); Thomas Tapping, The Law and Practice of the \nHigh Prerogative Writ of Mandamus as it Obtains Both in England and in Ireland 221 (1853) \n(“The writ of mandamus . . . has by a great number of cases held to be grantable . . . to restore \nhim who has been wrongfully displaced, to any office, function, or franchise of a public nature \n. . . .”); id. at 224 (distinguishing an officer “at pleasure” who may be removed without cause).12  \nEven the treatise cited in Defendants’ opposition explains that a court sitting in equity would \n“not interfere by injunction” in such cases simply because it would instead “leave that question \nto be determined by a legal forum.”  2 James L. High, Treatise on the Law of Injunctions § 1312 \n(2d ed. 1880); see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  This was the state of the law at the time of the \nfounding, as well as when Congress passed the All Writs Act as part of the Judiciary Act of \n1789.  See Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 40 (1985).  For this reason, \nthe Supreme Court was careful in both In re Sawyer and White v. Berry to specify that \nmandamus was available “to determine the title to a public office” in “the courts of law.”  In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. at 212; White, 171 U.S. at 377.13 \n \n12 Later treatises provide additional support for use of the writ of mandamus “for the \npurpose of restoring an individual to an office, where he has been illegally deprived of the \npossession thereof.”  Horace G. Wood, A Treatise on the Legal Remedies of Mandamus and \nProhibition, Habeas Corpus, Certiorari and Quo Warranto 11 (1891).  “When the title to the \noffice is indisputable,” proceedings for the writ of quo warranto would be “dilatory” and “a \nmandamus would be proper and should be awarded.”  Id. at 12 (quoting 7 How., 128); see also 1 \nHoward Clifford Joyce, A Treatise on the Law Relating to Injunctions § 55 (1909) (“The \njurisdiction to determine the title to a public office belongs only to courts of law and is exercised \n. . . by mandamus . . . and the mode of procedure established by the common law or by statute”); \n2 Eugene McQuillin, A Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations § 582 (1911) (same). \n13 Defendants argue that Harris was effectively removed from office and seeks a court \norder returning her to it.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  The D.C. Circuit has clarified that this is not \nthe case, and that Harris was never in fact removed.  See Kalbfus, 42 App. D.C. at 321 (“In the \npresent case the removal of the relator having been illegal and void, the office never became \nvacant . . . .”). \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 26 of 35\nAs the Court explains below, however, a writ of mandamus can issue under our \ncontemporary jurisprudence only when “the party seeking issuance of the writ ha[s] no other \nadequate means to attain the relief he desires.”  Kerr v. U. S. Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of California, \n426 U.S. 394, 403 (1976) (citing Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass’n, 319 U.S. 21, 26 (1943)).  \nBecause the Court reads Sampson, Swan, and Severino to allow it to issue an injunction, it \nconcludes that this injunction represents “adequate means” to provide Harris’s requested relief, \nbarring a mandamus remedy.  Kerr, 426 U.S. at 403.  This represents a curious reversal from \nnorms before English courts, where reinstatement of officials through legal means was preferred \nover restoration through equitable means.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 976–81; Severino, 71 F.4th at  \n1042–43.  Yet the broader point is that this Court may provide Harris some form of effective \nrelief preventing her unlawful termination from the MSPB, whether it be through an injunction \nor a writ of mandamus.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 977 n.1 (explaining that a request for injunction \nand request for writ of mandamus can be “essentially” the same thing in some contexts).  \nFinally, Defendants argue that the Court cannot enjoin the President or enjoin others in a \nmanner that restricts his Article II authority.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 16.  To be clear, Harris does \nnot ask the Court to enjoin President Trump, see, e.g., Pl.’s Proposed Order, and the Court does \nnot do so.14  Yet Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that a court lacks the power to \nenjoin the President’s subordinates to restrain the President’s violation of law.  In fact, that is \n \n14 The availability of injunctive relief against the President may depend in part on \nwhether compliance with 5 U.S.C. 1202(d) represents a ministerial rather than executive duty, a \nquestion the Supreme Court has “left open.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 \n(1992) (plurality opinion); see also State of Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475, 498 (1866) \n(declining to decide whether a court may require the President “to perform a purely ministerial \nact,” and defining a “ministerial duty” as “one in respect to which nothing is left to discretion); \nMcCray v. Biden, 574 F. Supp. 3d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2021) (“Franklin, however, did not absolutely \nslam the door shut on presidential injunctions.”).  Of course, the Court need not decide this \nquestion here. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 27 of 35\nprecisely the remedy the Supreme Court affirmed in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579, 584 (1952) (describing preliminary injunction restraining Secretary of Commerce \nfrom following President Truman’s orders and “continuing the seizure and possession of the \n[steel] plant”).  And in Swan v. Clinton, the D.C. Circuit concluded that a district court could \nenjoin the President’s subordinates in order to effectuate a federal official’s reinstatement.  See \n100 F.3d at 979; see also id. (concluding that “injunctive relief against such officials could \nsubstantially redress [the terminated official’s] injury”); see also Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042–43.  \nHaving assured itself that injunctive relief is available here, the Court proceeds to consider \nwhether a permanent injunction is warranted.15 \nb.  Factors for Permanent Injunction \nAn injunction “is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  Yet “it goes without saying that federal courts \nmust vigilantly enforce federal law and must not hesitate in awarding necessary relief.”  DL v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 860 F.3d 713, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. \n433, 450 (2009)).  A permanent injunction is a “forward-looking” remedy, Gratz v. Bollinger, \n539 U.S. 244, 284 (2003), the “principal purpose” of which is to “deter future violations, and not \nto punish the violator,” Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1169 (D.C. \nCir. 1978).  “[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a \ncourt may grant such relief.”  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).  A \nplaintiff must demonstrate: “(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies \n \n15 Defendants additionally suggest that “when executive officers have challenged their \nremoval by the President, they have traditionally sought back pay, not reinstatement.”  Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 13.  The Court fails to see how it might lack the power to issue injunctive relief here \nsimply because the plaintiffs in Wiener and Humphrey’s Executor decided to seek another \nremedy. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 28 of 35\navailable at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) \nthat, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity \nis warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  \nId.  Where the federal government is the opposing party, the balance of equities and public \ninterest factors merge.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The Supreme Court “has \nrepeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been \nirreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.”  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 \nU.S. 305, 312 (1982); see also Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, \n297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (same). \nFor the same reasons the Court discussed in its previous opinion, Harris has established \nthat she has suffered irreparable harm and will likely suffer irreparable harm in the future absent \ninjunctive relief.  See Mem. Op. at 11–19; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 540 F. Supp. 3d. 45, 55 (D.D.C. May 21, 2021) (“While the irreparable-harm \nrequirement is recited in the past tense, it is clear that future harm may qualify.” (citing \nMonsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 162 (2010))).  Congress intended the \nMSPB and its members to carry out their limited duties with a degree of independence from the \nPresident, guided primarily by his selection of members for the multimember board rather than \n“the Damocles’ sword of removal.”  Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356.  As the Court reasoned in its \nprevious memorandum opinion, the MSPB’s independence would evaporate if the President \ncould terminate its members without cause, even if a court could later order them reinstated.  See \nMem. Op. at 16.  Harris has undoubtedly experienced an injury to this independence in her \ncapacity as a member of the MSPB following the President’s attempt to terminate her without \ncause, and any future attempts would prove just as harmful to that autonomy.   \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 29 of 35\nHarris additionally suffers irreparable harm because she has been “depriv[ed] of [her] \nstatutory right to function” as a member of the MSPB, and any further attempts to separate her \nfrom her position will exacerbate this injury.  Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983).  The termination email Harris received resulted in the inability to pursue \nher “statutory mission” to protect employees from prohibited personnel practices, such that “the \nloss of the ability to do what Congress specifically directed [her] to do cannot be remediated with \nanything other than equitable relief.”  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at \n*11 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2025).  In addition, unlike most other federal employees, Harris was duly \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to a position carrying a term of years \nwith specific reasons for her removal.   \nThe Court finds that this harm represents a “genuinely extraordinary situation” meriting \ninjunctive relief related to a federal employee’s discharge.  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68; see \nalso Mem. Op. at 12–13 (discussing Sampson).  The clear federal statute granting Harris for-\ncause removal protections, coupled with longstanding precedent upholding the constitutionality \nof analogous provisions, overcomes the “latitude” traditionally afforded the Government “in the \n‘dispatch of its own internal affairs.’”  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83.  The plaintiff in Sampson, who \nfailed to meet this standard, sought an injunction temporarily enjoining her dismissal during an \nadministrative appeal.  See id. at 63.  Yet the parties point to no administrative pathway here \nthrough which Harris could seek reinstatement following improper termination.  Furthermore, \nwhereas the Sampson plaintiff was a probational employee, see id. at 62, Harris is a member of \nthe board of an independent agency, was appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate, and enjoys tenure protections to preserve her independence. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 30 of 35\nFor similar reasons, it is also apparent that “remedies available at law, such as monetary \ndamages, are inadequate to compensate for” Harris’s injuries.  eBay Inc., 547 U.S. at 391.  \nDefendants argue that loss of salary generally does not represent irreparable harm.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 19.  As the Court has explained, however, this is not a standard employment action that \ncan be remedied through back pay and later reinstatement, and Harris’s claims do not revolve \naround her salary.  See Mem. Op. at 15.   \nDefendants additionally cite Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997), for the notion that “a \nloss of political power” does not represent injury.  Defs.’ Mot. at 15.  Raines is a case about \nlegislators’ standing to sue over legislation they perceive to cede power to the Executive Branch, \nand the case has minimal application to the irreparable injury analysis here.  See 521 U.S. at \n820–21.  Harris is not a member of Congress, nor is standing at issue.  The Supreme Court \nreasoned in Raines that any injury would be far too diffuse to support the legislators’ standing, as \nit was spread across both Houses of Congress, and the legislators did not claim injury arising \nfrom “something to which they personally are entitled.”  Id. at 821.  If anything, Raines supports \nHarris’s claim to injury based on exclusion from her office: she has “been singled out for \nspecially unfavorable treatment as opposed to other Members,” and has lost something to which \nshe is “personally” entitled.  Id.   \nFinally, injunctive relief in this case is in the public interest, and the balance of the \nequities tips in Harris’s favor.  Given that federal law limits the conditions under which Harris’s \ntenure may be terminated, Supreme Court precedent supports the constitutionality of those \nconditions, and Defendants do not argue that those conditions were met here, the Court finds that \nit is in the public interest to issue injunctive relief.  “[T]here is a substantial public interest ‘in \nhaving governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 31 of 35\noperations.’”  League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. \n2016) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).  So too is there \nsubstantial public interest in the for-cause removal protections Congress has given to certain \nmembers of independent agencies.  Furthermore, the government “cannot suffer harm from an \ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice or reads a statute as required.”  R.I.L-R v. \nJohnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, \n1145 (9th Cir. 2013)). \nDefendants suggest that the public interest weighs against injunctive relief here because \n“[s]uch a remedy would undermine the accountability of the Executive Branch instilled by the \nConstitution,” and the President “cannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal \nofficer.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 20–21.  This argument largely relies on Defendants’ success on the \nmerits, and the Court has already determined that the President lacks the power to remove Harris \nat will.  Defendants additionally argue that “the public interest is better served by an MSPB \nmember who holds the President’s confidence.”  Id. at 21.  Yet Defendants decline to explain \nexactly how the public interest would be better served by removing Harris from her position.  \nThey do not dispute any of Harris’s factual assertions, including her efforts to consider, \ndeliberate, and vote on 35 cases per week to clear the MSPB’s backlog of nearly 3,800 cases.  \nSee SUMF ¶¶ 12–28.  This effort was successful, as by early this year the inherited cases had all \nbut disappeared.  See id. ¶ 20.  Recall that many of these cases involve allegations that federal \nagencies engaged in prohibited personnel practices, such as targeting of federal employees based \non political affiliation; retaliation against whistleblowers reporting violations of law, waste, fraud \nand abuse; discrimination; and USERRA violations, among others.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 4–5 \n(collecting cases).  Defendants make no effort to enlighten the Court as to how Harris’s handling \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 32 of 35\nof these cases might differ from the President’s preferred approach, let alone in a manner that \nmight tilt the public interest factor in their favor.  Defendants additionally overlook the fact that \nif Harris or her colleagues were ever to become inefficient, neglect their duty, or engage in \nmalfeasance in office, the President would be empowered to remove them for cause.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202(d).  The Court thus finds nothing in Defendants’ arguments that might support a \npublic interest against injunctive relief here. \nThe Court additionally notes that in opposing injunctive relief in its entirety, Defendants \nhave declined to engage with the scope of Harris’s proposed relief.  See generally Proposed \nOrder; Defs.’ Opp’n.  The Court will nonetheless tailor its declaratory and injunctive relief to \nmeet Harris’s entitlement under the law.16 \n3.  Writ of Mandamus \nHarris requests that the Court issue a writ of mandamus if no other relief is available.  See \nPl.’s Mot. at 34–35.  Defendants argue that the President has no clear nondiscretionary duty here, \nas his selection of “who should lead an Executive Branch agency is certainly not a mere \nministerial task.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 22.   \n“The preemptory common-law writs are among the most potent weapons in the judicial \narsenal.”  Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 107 (1967).  A district court has “original \njurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus” only if  “(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to \nrelief; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy \n \n16 Although injunctive relief is merited, the Court narrows Harris’s request slightly.  \nHarris seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting several Defendants from removing her or \ntreating her as removed.  See Proposed Order.  Yet § 1202(d) permits the President to remove her \nfor inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  The Court nonetheless notes the \nundisputed record demonstrating that Harris and her colleagues have carried out their duties to \ndecide cases in addition to clearing a significant backlog. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 33 of 35\navailable to [the] plaintiff.”  In re Nat’l Nurses United, 47 F.4th 746, 752 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Muthana v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 893, 910 (D.C. Cir. 2021)).  “[M]andamus jurisdiction \nunder § 1361 merges with the merits.”  Muthana, 985 F.3d at 910 (quoting Lovitky v. Trump, 949 \nF.3d 753, 759 (D.C. Cir. 2020)).  “[E]ven if the plaintiff overcomes all these hurdles, whether \nmandamus relief should issue is discretionary.”  In re Cheney, 406 F.3d 723, 729 (D.C. Cir. \n2005). \nThe Court finds the first two requirements for mandamus relief to be satisfied.  A court \n“can analyze the clear right to relief and clear duty to act requirements for mandamus \n‘concurrently.’”  Illinois v. Ferriero, 60 F.4th 704, 715 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Lovitky, 949 \nF.3d at 760).  “[T]o meet the ‘clear duty to act’ standard, ‘[t]he law must not only authorize the \ndemanded action, but require it; the duty must be clear and indisputable.’”  Ferriero, 60 F.4th at \n715 (quoting United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, 283 U.S. 414, 420 (1931).  Based on the \nCourt’s holding that federal law precludes the President’s power to remove Harris at will, the \nCourt finds a duty here that is clear and indisputable, and under binding Supreme Court \nprecedent there is no “room for an honest difference of opinion” on the part of federal officials.  \nReichelderfer v. Johnson, 72 F.2d 552, 554 (D.C. Cir. 1934).  In other words, the statute does not \nprovide room for executive discretion—the President has no menu of options to pick from when \nhe categorically may not remove Harris without cause.  In making this determination, the Court \nadditionally looks to the voluminous precedent demonstrating that courts of law issued \nmandamus relief in similar situations at the time Congress passed the All Writs Act in 1789 and \nover the ensuing centuries. \nAs the Court previewed earlier, however, it appears at present that Harris has a separate, \n“adequate remedy” available in the form of a permanent injunction.  In re Nat’l Nurses United, \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 34 of 35\n47 F.4th at 752 n.4.  The Court thus determines that her request for mandamus relief fails on that \nbasis alone.  Were equitable injunctive relief unavailable here, however, the Court would not \nhesitate to “vigilantly enforce federal law” and “award[] necessary relief” through a writ of \nmandamus as an alternative remedy at law.  DL, 860 F.3d at 726. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris’s motion for summary judgment is \nGRANTED; and it is  \nDECLARED that Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris remains a member of the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, having been confirmed by the Senate on May 25, 2022, and sworn in on June \n1, 2022, and that she may be removed by the President prior to the expiration of her term in \noffice only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1202; and it is \nFURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris shall continue to serve as a \nmember of the Merit Systems Protection Board until her term expires pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1202, unless she is earlier removed for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office \nunder that statute.  Defendants Secretary Scott Bessent, Deputy Director Trent Morse, Director \nSergio Gor, Acting Chairman Henry Kerner, and Director Russell Vought are ENJOINED from \nremoving Harris from her office without cause or in any way treating her as having been \nremoved without cause, denying or obstructing Harris’s access to any of the benefits or resources \nof her office, placing a replacement in Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other \nperson as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board in Harris’s position; and it is  \n \n \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 40     Filed 03/04/25     Page 35 of 35\nFURTHER ORDERED that the Court’s Temporary Restraining Order is VACATED. \nAn order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously \nissued. \nDated:  March 4, 2025  RUDOLPH CONTRERAS \n  United States District Judge \n35 ",

HARRIS, in her personal capacity   \nand in her official capacity as Member of the   \nMerit Systems Protection Board,   \n   \nPlaintiff, \n   Civil Case No. 1:25-cv-00412-RC \n  \n \nv. \n \n \n \nSCOTT BESSENT, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Treasury, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S MOTION \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n \nIn its Opposition, the government makes no effort to argue that it complied with the law \nwhen it removed Plaintiff from her position as a Member of the MSPB. Rather, it argues that the \nstatutory provisions of the CSRA that provide for her appointment and limit her removal are \nthemselves unconstitutional. Given the strong presumption of constitutionality due to Congress’s \nacts,1 given that in nearly a half-century of considering cases arising under the CSRA the Supreme \nCourt has not even hinted that any of its provisions might be unconstitutional,2 and given binding \nSupreme Court precedent directly on point,3 the government’s argument is truly for another day \nand another court. Accordingly, Plaintiff limits this response principally to the question of whether \nshe will suffer irreparable injury absent entry of the relief she seeks here. \n \n1 Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170, 175 (1978). \n2 See, e.g., United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 444-45 (1988); Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, \n44 (2012); Perry v. MSPB, 582 U.S. 420, 423 (2017). \n3 Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 625-26, 629 (1935). Indeed, the Solicitor \nGeneral has conceded that Humphrey’s Executor is still good law. See S. Harris letter to R. \nDurbin, Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee (Feb. 12, 2025) (“the Department intends \nto urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision”) (attached as Ex. B).  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 2 of 14\nI.  Plaintiff Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent Relief From This Court. \nPlaintiff has brought this action in both her individual and official capacities. While \ndistinct, the injuries she has suffered and continues to suffer in those capacities are significant and \nirreparable. No order of retroactive relief can fully redress them.  \nA.  Irreparable harm in Plaintiff’s official capacity \n1.  Plaintiff is deprived of ability to fulfill official duties \nIn her official capacity, Plaintiff is being deprived of the ability to fulfill the duties entrusted \nto her upon her appointment. She was appointed and confirmed by the Senate because her \n“demonstrated ability, background, training, or experience [] especially qualified [her] to carry out the \nfunctions of the Board.” 5 U.S.C. § 1201. Her unlawful removal deprives her of the ability to share \nher deliberative expertise in the adjudication of cases before the MSPB. Each case that is decided \nwithout her expertise, input, and vote is a continuing and irreparable harm. \nThe longer Ms. Harris is removed from her position, the greater the deprivation and the \ngreater the disruption to the processes of the MSPB. Plaintiff requests in Count 2 of her Complaint \nto have the Court set aside any action the MSPB takes in her absence as unlawful. Thus, absent \nthe requested relief, any cases decided in her absence will need to be re-deliberated and re-voted \nby all the Board members. This will not only disrupt and seriously slow the functions of the Board, \nit will have deleterious results for parties who expect and deserve final and fully-deliberated Board \ndecisions in their adjudications. Setting aside weeks, months, or even years of actions, and untold \nnumbers of decisions will be extremely disruptive. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 3 of 14\n  Indeed, since Ms. Harris was illegally terminated, the Board has ceased issuing decisions \ndue to the uncertainty caused by the Defendants’ actions.4 Typically, during Ms. Harris’s tenure, \nthe Board issues between 3-11 decisions per day.5 Thus, the longer the deprivation, the longer the \ndisruption to the Board and to Ms. Harris.  \nWhen assessing the irreparable nature of the harm to Ms. Harris, “it is equally important to \nexamine the disruptive effect of a denial of such relief.” Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL \n538, at *15 n.4 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Here, \nalthough there is now a quorum with two remaining Board members, that will change in two weeks \nwhen Member Limon’s term ends on March 1, 2025.6 The Board will be without a quorum and its \nwork will grind to a halt. \nThus, there are no facts to show that maintaining Ms. Harris as a Member would have any \n“disruptive effect” on the adjudicative functions of the Board. Rather, removing her would be \nsignificantly more disruptive to the Board than returning her to her role during the pendency of \nthis litigation. \nIn addition, the government has stated that it intends to replace Ms. Harris with someone \nlike-minded to the President; i.e., it asserts that the MSPB is better served by someone who “holds \nthe President’s confidence and, accordingly, will more effectively serve him in executing his duties \nas the Chief Executive.” Def. Opp. at 14. But this assertion flies in the face of Congress’s intent to \n \n4 See https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecdec.htm (showing that as of February 14, 2025, no \nMSPB decisions have been issued since February 10, 2025). \n5 See id. \n6 Mr. Limon could potentially hold over for up to one year after the conclusion of his statutory \nterm, if he chooses to do so, and if there is no confirmed nominee to take his place. 5 U.S.C. \n§1202(b). However, whether he does so and whether he is permitted to do so is purely \nspeculative. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 4 of 14\nhave an independent agency, whose members serve staggered terms and specifically deprives Ms. \nHarris of her official responsibility to execute her uniquely bipartisan, independent role on the \nBoard. Indeed, the Board Members do not have any statutory authority or role to “serve” the \nPresident. By disrupting the intended staggered terms that span administrations and removing Ms. \nHarris prematurely, the Defendants have caused Ms. Harris irreparable harm as she is prevented \nfrom exercising her expertise on the Board for the entirety of the term that was intended for her by \nCongress.  \nUnder 5 U.S.C. § 1202, it is not the President’s prerogative to prematurely end a duly-\nconfirmed Member’s term except for the causes enumerated under the statute. This Board was not \nestablished to execute the agenda of any particular President. As noted in Seila Law LLC v. \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 199 (2020), the Board’s staggered terms \nare intended to ensure the accumulation of institutional knowledge and the bipartisan nature of the \nBoard. This is vital as Board Members are responsible for the interpretation of law that is set by \nCongress and the Courts over decades of precedent. It was not the intent of Congress to create an \ninstitution where there is an abrupt shift in leadership that would allow it to be totally realigned \nwith the Presidential prerogatives, such as with the single-Director configuration of the CFPB. \nThat is, by design Members of the MSPB are not responsible for promoting or enforcing policy \nset by the President or in furthering the President’s political agenda. \n2.  Plaintiff  in  her  Official  Capacity  suffers  injury  due  to  her  illegal \ntermination  \n \nContrary to defendants’ representations, the Board is hampered in several respects by only \nhaving two members as opposed to the full complement. If the two remaining members split on a \ndecision, the matter reverts to the administrative judge’s initial decision or may be held until a third \nBoard member is confirmed. See, e.g., Brinson v. Dep’t of Navy, 2023 WL 5899869 (2023). The \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 5 of 14\nillegal termination prevents Ms. Harris from exercising her official responsibility in providing a \ndeciding vote. It also deprives parties of the statutorily-prescribed expectation of receiving a final \ndecision from the Board.  \nRecusals by Board members also pose a serious issue when there are only two Board \nmembers. Mr. Kerner, the Acting Chairman of the MSPB, due to his prior position as Special \nCounsel at the Office of Special Counsel, is currently required to recuse from “any particular \nmatter involving specific parties in which [he] know[s] [he] previously participated at the Office \nof Special Counsel, unless [he] is first authorized to participate, using the factors in 5 C.F.R.               \n§2635.502(d).”7 Mr. Kerner’s appointment extends until March 1, 2030, and thus this will be a \ncontinuing issue when he recuses and there is only one other Board member to vote on such cases. \nIn such instances, the Board cannot issue a decision, and the matter reverts to the initial decision \nof the administrative judge or is held until another Board Member can join in the deliberation. Nor \nwill the Board be able to grant stays of prohibited personnel practices brought before it by the \nOffice of Special Counsel with only one voting Board Member. It is a fact that Mr. Kerner has \nrecused from many whistleblower cases. See, e.g., Reese v. Dep’t of the Navy, 2025 WL 371023; \nYoung v. DHS, 2024 WL 5074870; Maclean v. DHS, 2024 WL 4799811; Collier v. SBA, 2024 WL \n4624610.8  \nThe harm caused by lack of quorum is not speculative. Indeed, during the prior Trump \nadministration, the lack of quorum paralyzed the Board from rendering decisions at the Board \nlevel. See MSPB, Frequently Asked Questions about the Lack of Quorum Period and Restoration \n \n7 See https://oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Officials%20Individual%20Disclosures%20Search% \n20Collection?OpenForm. \n8 Whistleblower cases generally constitute approximately 25% of the Board’s docket, and there \nare hundreds of cases pending for the Board to decide from the 2022-2025 timeframe. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 6 of 14\nof the Full Board (June 3, 2024).9 This resulted in a backlog of nearly 3800 cases. See MSPB, \nLack of Quorum and the Inherited Inventory (Jan. 31, 2025).10 Parties went without decisions for \nyears. Ironically, in other matters currently pending, Defendants repeatedly rely on the MSPB as a \ncrucial adjudicative body for federal employees to seek redress. See, e.g.,Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n, \net. al., v. Trump, et. al., Case No. 25-cv-00352-CJN (D.D.C) Dkt No. 20; Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emp., \net. al. v. Ezell, Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-10276 (D.Mass) Dkt No. 45.   \n3.  Plaintiff’s  irreparable  harm  derives  from  federal  statute  and  the \nConstitution \nPlaintiff’s irreparable harm results from the President’s violation of her statutory for-cause \nprotection and the violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers. These violations cause \nirreparable harm to Plaintiff. \nIn Callicotte v. Carlucci, the Court observed: \nThe government, relying on Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974), urges the Court to \nadopt a higher standard for interim injunctive relief in federal personnel actions. The \nSupreme Court in Sampson required the plaintiff, a federal employee who alleged that the \nagency dismissed her without following the procedures under the Civil Service Act, to \nshow irreparable injury of an “extraordinary degree” for injunctive relief, id. at 92 n.68. \nThe  Court  predicated  its  imposition  of  a  higher  standard  on  the  grounds  that  the \ngovernment must be given wide latitude to handle its own internal personnel affairs. Id. at \n83. The Court, however, did not and has not expressly extended this rule to employees \nalleging  violations  of  their  statutory  civil  rights.  Such  challenges  raise  equally \ncompelling, if not stronger governmental interests, in the enforcement of our nation’s \ncivil rights laws.  \n698 F.Supp 944, 949 (D.D.C. 1988) (emphasis added). \nPlaintiff seeks to enforce her statutory right to hold the position to which she was appointed \nand confirmed–for a 7-year term–and to vindicate constitutional rights derived from the separation \nof powers. The importance of the governmental interest in the enforcement of our nation’s civil \n \n9 Available at https://www.mspb.gov/FAQs_Absence_of_Board_Quorum_6032024.pdf. \n10 Available at https://www.mspb.gov/foia/files/HQ_Case_Processing_Data.pdf. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 7 of 14\nservice law, as well as the constitutional rights place this as an extraordinary matter worthy of \nimmediate interim relief by the court. See, e.g., Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 299-300 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (dismissal in violation of First Amendment constitutional \nrights  “for  even  minimal  periods  of  time,  unquestionably  constitutes  irreparable  injury.”). \nExtending the higher standard of Sampson to this unique case would undermine the vital interest \nin enforcing the CSRA and upholding constitutional principles. \n4.  Illegal termination of Plaintiff upsets the structure of the MSPB \nAllowing Ms. Harris’s illegal termination to stand for even a short period would violate the \nbipartisan,  independent  nature  of  the  Board.  The  MSPB’s  unique  need  for  independence \ndistinguishes it from the CFPB and the FHFA. The CFPB and FHFA were designed by Congress \nto regulate and oversee outside actors engaging in the marketplace. The MSPB is vastly different \nin function and purpose. The MSPB lacks any regulatory oversight or powers and the Board \nMembers’ independence is fundamental to its purpose. The MSPB’s mission is to “Protect the \nMerit System Principles and promote an effective Federal workforce free of Prohibited Personnel \nPractices.”11 It ensures that federal employees have an adjudicatory process that consistently and \nfairly applies the merit systems principles to individual cases on adverse actions, whistleblower \nretaliation appeals, and violations of USERRA and VEOA, amongst other federal civil service \nadjudications. The independence of Board Members is critical to ensuring that these adjudications \nare free from political influence or retaliation. A Board that is removable at the whim of the \nPresident severely undermines the confidence of the federal employees or veterans availing \nthemselves  of  this  system.  For-cause  removal  protections  provide  assurance  of  bipartisan \nindependence so that the Board members are able to independently assess, deliberate, and rule on \n \n11 https://www.mspb.gov/about/about.htm \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 8 of 14\nmatters.  This is critical to ensure that the Federal workforce functions as the CSRA intended—\nfree from political influence. Indeed, holding otherwise would be chilling to the remaining Board \nMembers, the administrative judges who adjudicate the initial appeals, and the federal employees \nwho seek redress. \nDefendants state that their purpose in removing Plaintiff is to dismantle the Board’s \nindependence by having the President appoint someone who will “more effectively serve him.” \nDef. Opp. at 14. This is directly at odds with the Merit System Principles that the MSPB is tasked \nwith enforcing, including protecting employees from “arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or \ncoercion for partisan political purposes.” 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8)(a). In short, the independence of \nthe MSPB is an essential component of the merit system established by Congress in the CSRA. \nEach day that this independence is diminished by Defendants’ unlawful actions is a serious and \nirreparable harm to Ms. Harris in her official capacity as a Board Member.  \nB.  Irreparable harm in Plaintiff’s individual capacity \nAs an individual, Plaintiff is being deprived of the honor and privilege of serving her nation \nand fulfilling the trust bestowed upon her by the President when he appointed her as a Member of \nthe MSPB. That this is a great honor cannot be gainsaid; so too, there can be no serious dispute \nthat the injury occasioned by her unlawful removal from that role is “both certain and great” and \n“actual and not theoretical.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). Nor can \nthere be any dispute that this harm is “beyond remediation,” id.; Plaintiff’s appointment was for a \nlimited term and no court can give her back the days that she is unlawfully stripped of her office. \nPlaintiff has been deprived of her statutory right to function in her office, following the \nappointment of the President and confirmation by the Senate to an office with for-cause removal \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 9 of 14\nprotections. See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), \nvacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, \n147 (D.D.C. 1993), vacated as moot sub nom. Mackie v. Clinton, 10 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (per \ncuriam). When the President nominates and the Senate confirms a person to execute specific \nofficial functions, and that person is unlawfully fired, she suffers an immediate and irreparable loss \nof her legally vested right to personally function in that official position. \n  The government in its Opposition relies heavily on Sampson v. Murray,12 but this reliance \nis misplaced. Sampson has come to stand for the proposition that “in the absence of special \ncircumstances  .  .  .  recoverable  economic  losses  are  not  considered  irreparable.”  Taylor  v. \nResolution Tr. Corp., 56 F.3d 1497, 1507 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing Sampson, 415 U.S. at 90 \n(“temporary loss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable \ninjury”)). \n  Plaintiff does not claim, however, that her loss of salary and benefits constitutes irreparable \ninjury—she did not accept appointment to the Board out of a desire to earn less than a senior \ngovernment attorney.13 Rather, her focus is on the loss of her ability to fulfill the duties and \nresponsibilities entrusted to her for the remainder of her term. No form of retroactive relief can \ngive her back the days of her term that the Defendants have unlawfully taken from her. Absent \ninjunctive relief, her Board position could be filled by another person and no form of retroactive \nrelief could undo this appointment or retroactively substitute Plaintiff’s input into the Board’s \ndeliberative processes. And because there is no relief that could be fashioned to restore to her what \n \n12 415 U.S. 61 (1975) \n13 See American Relief Act, 2025 (Public Law 118-158, Dec. 21, 2024) (the freeze on the \npayable pay rates for certain senior political appointees will continue through March 14, 2025). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 10 of 14\nthe Defendants have unlawfully taken, her injuries are truly irreparable and without the interdiction \nimposed by Sampson. \n   The irreparable harm suffered by Ms. Harris is therefore of a different nature than the harm \nnoted in the various cases cited by Defendants regarding lower-level federal employee and non-\nfederal employee claims. See Def. Opp. at 11. The plaintiffs in those matters do not allege any \nharm beyond the traditional harm an employee suffers by loss of employment that can be later \nremedied at law. See, e.g., Hetreed v. Allstate Ins. Co., 135 F.3d 1155 (7th Cir. 1998) (alleging loss \nof income and reputation); Ferris v. Rice, 453 F. Supp. 2d 76 (D.D.C. 2006) (alleging loss of \nincome, forced retirement, and difficulty obtaining other employment); Marxe v. Jackson, 833 F.2d \n1121 (3d Cir. 1987) (alleging loss of ability to gather information in support of litigation). The \nharm outlined by Plaintiff above far exceeds that articulated by the plaintiffs in the cases cited by \nDefendants.   \nII.  The MSPB does not perform executive functions. \n  In an effort to escape the reach of the Supreme Court’s decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. \nUnited States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), Defendants argue, without citation, that the Board performs \n“executive functions.” Def. Opp. at 7. This is a red herring. The relevant question is whether the \nMSPB Members exercise “executive power.” Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215-17. Humphrey’s Executor \ndistinguishes the two concepts of executive functions and executive power. In any event, the \nBoard’s authority is judicial in nature and all its arguably executive functions stem from its \nadjudicatory powers.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 11 of 14\nUnlike CFPB and FHFA (the agencies at issue in Seila Law and Collins14), the MSPB has \nno external or outward-facing regulatory or enforcement authority that would need to be weighed \nhere. The MSPB is entirely an inward-facing adjudicatory Board with limited jurisdiction over \nfederal employee appeals. Thus, MSPB does not exercise “executive power in the constitutional \nsense.” Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628. \nThe CFPB’s functions go far beyond the authority of the MSPB. The MSPB does not \nconduct investigations. The MSPB relies on Congressionally approved appropriations. The MSPB \nis not a regulatory body. The MSPB does not prosecute matters or litigate in federal court (except \nas defendants in certain challenges to MSPB decisions in support of its adjudicatory function).  \nThe Board’s primary role is to adjudicate legal claims that come within the Board’s \njurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1), including Title VII cases when a litigant raises a claim of \ndiscrimination in response to an adverse personnel action. See 5 U.S.C. § 7702. In considering \nTitle VII claims, the Board uses the same legal standards and burdens to adjudicate the claims as \nused by federal courts in Title VII cases. See e.g., Pridgen v. Off. of Mgmt. and Budget, 2022 \nM.S.P.B. 31 (Sept 12, 2022). \nDefendants allege, without citation, that the MSPB has a role in “managing the internal \nworkforce of the Executive Branch.” Def. Opp. at 14. Defendants misapprehend the role of the \nMSPB. The MSPB does not make policy decisions on how the civil service operates. That \nauthority rests with the Office of Personnel Management, an agency that is separate from the \nMSPB. See Hisler v. Gallaudet Univ., 344 F. Supp. 2d 29, 42 (D.D.C. 2004) (“In 1978, CSRA \noverhauled the civil service system and created both the OPM and MSPB. Congress included in \n \n14 Selia Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 \nU.S. 220 (2021). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 12 of 14\nOPM’s responsibilities the administration of the CSRA.” (citing Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., \n470 U.S. 768, 773-74 (1985)). OPM performs enforcement actions, the MSPB does not. Compare \n5 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(5) and 7703(d) with 5 U.S.C. §§1204(f), 1206. \n  The role of the MSPB is primarily to “hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or \nadjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board.” 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1). Indeed, \nDefendants’ reliance in other matters upon the adjudicatory function of the MSPB underscores the \nfallacy of its arguments in the instant case.15 So, too, defendants’ seeming contention that the \nMSPB is predominantly executive simply because it lies within the executive branch is flat out \nwrong. The analysis is on the nature of the power exercised, not the placement of the agency within \nany particular branch. In short, the MSPB serves an independent judicial role, not an executive \nrole.  \nIII.  The Equitable Factors Support Interim Relief to Plaintiff. \nThis Court must also reject the Defendants’ argument that the balance of the equities \nweighs in their favor. Defendants’ argument is premised on their contention that the President has \nunfettered powers under the Constitution to terminate any agency official, including those with \nfor-cause  removal  protections.  Putting  aside  the  merits  of  Defendants’  arguments,  which \ncontravene the Supreme Court’s enduring jurisprudence in Humphrey’s Executor, the equities \noverwhelmingly lie with Ms. Harris. As Judge Berman Jackson held in Dellinger v. Bessent, \nDefendants “have proffered no circumstances that required the President’s hasty, unexplained \naction, or that would justify the immediate ejection” of a Senate-confirmed agency official “while \n \n15 See Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n, et. al., v. Trump, et. al., Case No. 25-cv-00352-CJN (D.D.C) Dkt \nNo. 20; Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emp., et. al. v. Ezell, Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-10276 (D.Mass) Dkt \nNo. 45.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 13 of 14\nthe legal issue is subject to calm and thorough deliberation.” Case No. 25-0385 (ABJ) (Feb. 12, \n2025) at *25. \nSimilarly, Defendants have parroted here what they have argued and what was rejected by \nJudge Berman Jackson in Dellinger, that “the public interest in better served by a [MSPB Member] \nwho  holds  the  President’s  confidence.”  Indeed,  “Congress  contemplated  and  established  a \nstructure” for the MSPB “that reflects a different priority.” Id. Like OSC, “independence is \nessential” to the MSPB’s ability to perform its unique duties in adjudicating matters within its \nlimited jurisdiction. And, like in Dellinger, “defendants have identified no impending injury or \nalleged constitutional error that cannot be fixed in the future that would outweigh the harm that \nwill flow from the precise circumstance Congress deliberately chose to prohibit.” Id. at *25-26. \nTherefore, these equitable factors weigh in Ms. Harris’s favor. \nThe independence of the Board from political interference by the President is particularly \nimportant now. The administration has issued numerous executive orders that will likely result in \nmany appeals being filed before the MSPB and cases that will inevitably come before the \nMembers. See e.g., E.O. on Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” \nWorkforce Optimization Initiative, sec. 3 (Feb. 11, 2025) (ordering agency heads to “promptly \ntake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law”). \nUnder 5 C.F.R. § 1201.3(a)(6), an employee may appeal to the MSPB regarding separations, \ndemotions or furlough for more than 30 days due to a reduction in force. See also Presidential \nMemo re: Restoring Accountability for Career Senior Executives (Jan. 20, 2025) (stating that SES \nemployees “serve at the pleasure of the President”); under 5 U.S.C. §§7541(1), 7542, & 7543(d), \nan SES employee may appeal their termination to the Board. It is important now more than ever \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 7     Filed 02/14/25     Page 14 of 14\nthat the Board maintain its bipartisan composition, institutional knowledge, and independence in \nfacing the deluge and novelty of this administration’s actions regarding the civil service.  \nIV.  Conclusion \nEach day that Plaintiff is deprived of faithfully deliberating and adjudicating these cases is \nan irreparable harm that cannot be undone; to her in both her individual and official capacities, and \nto the many litigants who will come before the Board expecting fair, impartial, and bipartisan \nadjudication of their cases. Again, with the loss of quorum imminent, reinstatement now is \nimperative. \nFor the reasons stated in Plaintiff’s motion and herein, Plaintiff Cathy A.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 16     Filed 02/20/25     Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n                                                                                   \n \nCATHY A. HARRIS,      \n     \n        Plaintiff,       \n   \nv.  Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00412-RC \n   \nSCOTT BESSENT, et al.,   \n   \n        Defendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY THE COURT’S TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER \nOn February 10, 2025, the President exercised his lawful authority under Article II when he \nremoved Plaintiff Cathy Harris from her position as a Member of the Merit Systems Protection Board \n(the “Board” or “MSPB”).  Nonetheless, that day, Plaintiff filed this action challenging her removal, \nECF No. 1, shortly thereafter moving for a temporary restraining order, ECF No. 2.  On February \n18, 2025, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion, issuing a temporary restraining order stating that \nDefendants are “enjoined from removing Harris from her office or in any way treating her as having \nbeen removed, denying or obstructing Harris’s access to any of the benefits or resources of her office, \nplacing a replacement in Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other person as a member of \nthe MSPB in Harris’s position, pending further order of the Court.”  Order, ECF No. 8; see also Mem. \nOp., ECF No. 9. \nThis relief constitutes an extraordinary intrusion into the President’s authority.  Accordingly, \nDefendants have now appealed the Court’s order and plan to seek a stay pending appeal from the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  Out of an abundance of caution to ensure \ncompliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a) (“A party must ordinarily move first in the \ndistrict court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal.”), Defendants \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 16     Filed 02/20/25     Page 2 of 3\nrespectfully move the Court to stay its temporary restraining order pending appeal. \n“[T]he factors regulating the issuance of a stay are . . . (1) whether the stay applicant has made \na strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably \ninjured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, \n776 (1987).  Here, these factors weigh in favor of a stay. \nFirst, Plaintiff has fallen far short of the required “strong showing” that she is likely to succeed \non the merits.  The Constitution vests the entirety of the “executive Power” in the President, who is \ngiven the sole responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II, § 1, cl. 1; id. \n§ 3.  For nearly a century, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed “the President’s power to \nremove—and thus supervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf.”  Seila L. LLC v. \nConsumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 204 (2020) (citing Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)).  \nBecause the MSPB is an executive branch agency that wields significant executive power, the President \nmay lawfully remove its Members at will. \nSecond, the balance of equities and public interest overwhelmingly favor a stay pending appeal.  \nSee Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (noting that these factors merge in cases involving the \ngovernment).  The Court’s temporary restraining order—in which it reinstalled Plaintiff in the office \nfrom which the President had removed her—is an extraordinary act.  It is a significant intrusion into \nthe President’s authority to exercise “all of” “the ‘executive Power’” of the United States, Seila Law, \n590 U.S. at 203.  The President is being prevented from installing an agency head of the President’s \nchoosing to implement his agenda, and the President must instead retain an agency head against his \nwill.  That sort of harm—to the Executive Branch, to the separation of powers, and to our democratic \nsystem—is transparently irreparable. \nConversely, Plaintiff has not established that she will suffer irreparable harm if the Court’s \norder is stayed pending appeal.  Although Plaintiff’s removal deprives her of her employment and \nsalary, such consequences ordinarily do not amount to irreparable injury, “however severely they may \naffect a particular individual.” Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974).  The traditional remedy \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00412-RC     Document 16     Filed 02/20/25     Page 3 of 3\nfor such claims has been an award of back pay at the end of the case, not interim reinstatement.  See \nOrder, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir.) (Katsas, J., dissenting), at 11.  And to the extent \nPlaintiff asserts irreparable harm to the functioning of the MSPB itself, that assertion is misplaced, \nbecause the MSPB can continue to function without Plaintiff.  See Eric Katz, Trump fires one-third of \nfederal  employee  appeals  board,  Government  Executive  (Feb.  11,  2025,  3:38  p.m.), \nhttps://www.govexec.com/management/2025/02/trump-fires-one-third-federal-employee-appeals-\nboard/402912/ (noting “the board will maintain its quorum”). \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant a stay of its temporary restraining order pending \nresolution of Defendants’ appeal. \n \n \nDated: February 20, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              BRETT A.

United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Wiener v.\nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld removal\nrestrictions for government officials on multimember adjudicatory boards.  While two\nlaws governing removal restrictions for single heads of agencies exercising executive\npolicymaking and enforcement powers have been held unconstitutional, see Seila Law\nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly stated that it was not overturning the precedent established in\nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener for multimember adjudicatory bodies.  Instead, the\nSupreme Court has, in its own words, left that precedent “in place[.]”  Seila Law, 591\nU.S. at 215 (2020); see id. at 228 (“not revisit[ing] Humphrey’s Executor”); Collins, 594\nU.S. at 250–251 (2021) (recognizing that Seila Law did “not revisit [] prior decisions”)\n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204); see also Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 687\n(1988) (in case involving restrictions on removal of an inferior officer, recognizing that\nHumphrey’s Executor remains good law); see generally Free Enter. Fund v. Public Acct.\nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (in case involving multimember board,\ndeclining to “reexamine” Humphrey’s Executor); id. at 501 (“[W]e do not * * * take issue\nwith for-cause limitations in general[.]”).\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant\nSupreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it.  If\na precedent of the Supreme Court “has direct application in a case,” lower courts\n“‘should follow the case which directly controls,’” leaving to the Supreme Court “‘the\nprerogative of overruling its own decisions.’”  Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S.\n122, 136 (2023) (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490\nU.S. 477, 484 (1989)).  That rule governs “even if the lower court thinks the precedent\nis in tension with ‘some other line of decisions.’”  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 (quoting\nRodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at 484); see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237\n(1997) (“We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, that other courts should conclude\nour more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier precedent.”).\nCircuit precedent compels the same result.  See, e.g., National Security Archive\nv. CIA, 104 F.4th 267, 272 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“This Court is charged with following\ncase law that directly controls a particular issue[.]”); Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 54\n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237); Sierra Club v. E.P.A., 322 F.3d\n718, 725 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.S. at 484).  \nPage 2\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5037 September Term, 2024\nThe Supreme Court’s repeated and recent statements that Humphrey’s Executor\nand Wiener remain precedential require denying the government’s emergency motions\nfor a stay pending appeal.  The government, in fact, has acknowledged a lack of clarity\nin the law.  See Oral Arg. Tr. 24:25–25:3 (“I’m not saying that [the Supreme Court has\nbeen] clear.”); 10:24–11:5 (“[T]he Supreme Court has left the lower courts in something\nof a tough spot[.]”); 84:16–23 (There is, “at a minimum, a very substantial question” and\n“reasonable minds can differ” about the scope of Humphrey’s Executor today.);\n88:17–18 (“[T]here’s some uncertainty” in the wake of Collins.).  In addition, at both\nparties’ request, the court has set a highly expedited schedule for the merits of these\nappeals that will allow the cases to be resolved in short order.\nWe hereby vacate the March 28, 2025 order staying the district courts’ final\njudgments and permanent injunctions in these cases.  In light of the precedent in\nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener concerning multimember adjudicatory bodies, the\ngovernment’s motions for a stay pending appeal are denied.  The government has not\ndemonstrated the requisite “strong showing that [it] is likely succeed on the merits” of\nthese two appeals.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The government\nlikewise has not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that\nthere is no available remedy for Harris or Wilcox, or that allowing the district court's\ninjunctions to remain in place pending appeal is impermissible.  See Panel Order\nGranting Stay at  41-46 (Millett, J., dissenting).  Nor has it demonstrated irreparable\ninjury because the claimed intrusion on presidential power only exists if Humphrey’s\nExecutor and Wiener are overturned.  See Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356 (“[N]o such power”\nto remove a predominantly adjudicatory board official “is given to the President directly\nby the Constitution[.]”); Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 629.  It is\nFURTHER ORDERED that the request for a 7-day stay be denied.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk\nBY: /s/\nLaura M. Morgan\nDeputy Clerk\n* Chief Judge Srinivasan fully joins this order, but he would grant the government’s request to\nstay this order for 7 days to permit the government to seek relief from the Supreme Court.\nPage 3\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5037 September Term, 2024\n** Circuit Judges Henderson, Katsas, Rao, and Walker dissent from this order, and they would\nalso grant the government’s request to stay this order for 7 days to permit the government to\nseek relief from the Supreme Court.  Separate dissenting statements of Circuit Judges\nHenderson, Rao, and Walker are attached.  Circuit Judges Henderson, Katsas, and Walker join\nin the statement of Circuit Judge Rao.  Circuit Judge Henderson joins in the statement of Circuit\nJudge Walker.\nPage 4\n\n \nKAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \n \n  We  do  the  parties  (especially  a  functioning  executive \nbranch) no favors by unnecessarily delaying Supreme Court \nreview of this significant and surprisingly controversial aspect \nof Article II authority.  Only the Supreme Court can decide the \ndispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better. \n \n\n \nRAO, Circuit Judge, dissenting: President Donald Trump \nremoved two principal officers wielding significant executive \npower: Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board and \nGwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board. The \ndistrict court held the removals were unlawful and imposed \nunprecedented and far reaching injunctions, ordering cabinet \nsecretaries and other Executive Branch officials to treat Harris \nand Wilcox as if they were never removed. A panel of this court \nwisely stayed those orders pending appeal. A majority of the \nen banc court now vacates the panel’s order and denies the stay \npending appeal.  \nThe  government  raises  two  independent  grounds  for \ngranting a stay. The en banc majority briefly discusses the first: \nthe lawfulness of the President’s removal of these officers. In \nmy  view,  a  stay  is  warranted  on  this  ground.  But  even \naccounting for disagreement as to the continuing validity of \nHumphrey’s Executor, the district court’s remedial overreach \nindependently justifies a stay. Because the majority denies the \nstay, it should have explained why the government is not likely \nto  prevail  on  its  argument  that  the  injunctions  exceed  the \ncourt’s equitable authority. Instead, the order devotes a single \nsentence to this question, likely because these remedies have \nno historical basis and put the courts on a collision course with \nthe President over his exercise of core executive power. I \nrespectfully dissent. \n* * * \nAs to the constitutional question, the government is likely \nto  succeed  because  the  President’s  removal  of  Harris  and \nWilcox falls within his Article II authority. The Constitution \nvests all executive power in a single President. U.S. CONST. art. \nII, § 1. The President has both the power and the responsibility \nto  supervise  and  direct  Executive  Branch  officers.  Id.  § 3 \n(requiring  the  President  to  “take  Care  that  the  Laws  be \nfaithfully  executed”).  To  carry  out  this  responsibility,  the \n \n\n2 \nPresident must be able to remove officers at will. “Since 1789, \nthe Constitution has been understood to empower the President \nto  keep … officers  accountable—by  removing  them  from \noffice,  if  necessary.”  Free  Enter.  Fund  v.  Pub.  Co.  Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (citing Myers v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)); see also Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2191 (2020) (explaining that without \nthe  removal  power  “the  President  could  not  be  held  fully \naccountable for discharging his own responsibilities”) (cleaned \nup).  \nThe en banc majority urges that we must continue to \nfollow Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 \n(1935), and Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), \nwhich held Congress may impose limits on the President’s \nability  to  remove  officers  of  some  so-called  independent \nagencies.  Although  those  cases  have  not  been  formally \noverruled, a series of  recent Supreme Court decisions has \nsubstantially eroded them, as Judge Walker explained. See \nHarris v. Bessent, No. 25-5037, 2025 WL 980278, at *7–13 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 28, 2025) (Walker, J., concurring); see also id. \nat *21–23 (Henderson, J., concurring) (concluding “reasonable \nminds can—and often do—disagree about the ongoing vitality \nof the Humphrey’s exception”). Under Article II, “[t]he buck \nstops with the President,” and he “therefore must have some \npower of removing those for whom he cannot continue to be \nresponsible.” Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 493 (cleaned up). \nWhile statutes provide for-cause removal protections for Harris \nand  Wilcox,  these  restrictions  are  likely  unconstitutional \nbecause they interfere with the President’s authority to remove \nprincipal officers who execute the law.  \nI will not elaborate on these points in this posture, as the \ndisagreement about the scope of the President’s removal power \nwas discussed at length in the panel opinions granting the stay.  \n \n\n3 \n* * * \nThat brings us to the second ground for granting a stay \npending  appeal:  the  district  court’s  expansive  and \nunprecedented injunctions. Since the panel majority granted \nthe stay on constitutional grounds, it had no need to evaluate \nthe likelihood the government would succeed on its challenge \nto the injunctive remedies. See Harris, 2025 WL 980278, at *2 \nn.10 (Walker, J., concurring). The en banc majority, however, \nis denying the stay and therefore should at least have explained \nwhy the government’s challenge to the remedy fails. Even if \nthe majority is right that Harris and Wilcox were unlawfully \nremoved under current Supreme Court precedent, there is a \nwholly separate question of whether reinstatement, effectuated \nby enjoining scores of Executive Branch officials, is the proper \nremedy.  \nIn its rush to vacate the panel’s stay and get Harris and \nWilcox back to work, the en banc majority essentially ignores \nthis question and assumes Harris and Wilcox may be restored \nto their offices through a judicially imposed fiction—namely, \ninjunctions  directing  agency  officials  to  treat  Harris  and \nWilcox as though they remain in office. \nThe district court’s injunctions present difficult and novel \nquestions about the remedial authority of the Article III courts \nin the context of the President’s exercise of his Article II \npowers. See  Dellinger  v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL \n559669, at *12 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) \n(noting the “extraordinary character” of an order “direct[ing] \nthe President to recognize and work with an agency head whom \nhe has already removed”). The government is likely to succeed \non  its  remedial  challenge  because  the  injunctive  relief \nconcocted by the district court is wholly unprecedented and \ntransgresses historical limits on our equitable authority. \n \n\n4 \nIt is worth recounting the broad sweep of the injunctions \nimposed here. Harris and Wilcox are no longer in office. The \ndistrict court purported to reinstate these officers by simply \ndeclaring  they  were  never  removed  in  the  first  place  and \nordering Executive Branch officials to play along. For Wilcox, \nthe district court ordered the Chairman of the NLRB “and his \nsubordinates,  agents,  and  employees”  to  refrain  “from \nremoving [Wilcox] from her office without cause or in any way \ntreating [Wilcox] as having been removed from office, from \nimpeding in any way her ability to fulfill her  duties as a \nmember of the NLRB, and from denying or obstructing her \nauthority or access to any benefits or resources of her office.” \nWilcox  v.  Trump,  No.  25-334,  2025  WL  720914,  at  *18 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025) (emphasis added). It further ordered \nthese same officials to provide Wilcox access to government \nfacilities  and  equipment  to  carry  out  her  duties.  Id.  The \ninjunction  for  Harris  is  similarly  novel,  prohibiting  the \nSecretary  of  the  Treasury  and  numerous  other  Executive \nBranch officers from “removing Harris from her office without \ncause or in any way treating her as having been removed \nwithout  cause.”  Harris  v.  Bessent,  No.  25-412,  2025  WL \n679303, at *16 (D.D.C. Mar. 4, 2025) (emphasis added). The \norder enjoins those same officials from “placing a replacement \nin Harris’s position, or otherwise recognizing any other person \nas a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board in Harris’s \nposition.” Id. \nThese  injunctions  are  formally  directed  at  Executive \nBranch  officials,  not  the  President.  But  in  reality,  their \nprohibitions include actions only the President may take. By \nwhat remedial fiction can the district court enjoin the Chairman \nof the NLRB or the Treasury Secretary from removing officers \nthey have no power to remove? No one suggests anyone other \nthan the President has  authority to remove these principal \nofficers. By what remedial fiction can the district court enjoin \n \n\n5 \nexecutive officers from choosing a replacement for Harris? \nMembers  of  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  must  be \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.  See  5  U.S.C.  § 1201.  When  a  decision,  like \nappointment or removal, “is by Constitution or law conferred \nupon [the President], … we are precluded from saying that it \nis, in practical effect, the decision of someone else.” Franklin \nv.  Massachusetts,  505  U.S.  788,  825  (1992)  (Scalia,  J., \nconcurring  in  part  and  concurring  in  the  judgment).  The \ninjunctions  purport  to  enjoin  the  President’s  subordinates, \ndirecting them to disregard the President’s removal and to \nrefrain from taking actions within the President’s exclusive \nconstitutional  and  statutory  powers.  There  is  simply  no \nprecedent for such expansive judicial directives against officers \nof the Executive Branch wielding essential executive powers.1 \nThese orders effectively reappoint officers removed by the \nPresident and direct all other Executive Branch officials to treat \nthe  removed  officers  as  if  they  were  still  in  office.  Such \ninjunctive relief is beyond the scope of our equitable authority. \nFederal courts have authority to issue only those equitable \nremedies administered by the English Court of Chancery and \ncourts sitting in equity at the time of the Founding. See Grupo \nMexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. \n308, 318–19 (1999) (“[T]he equity jurisdiction of the federal \ncourts is the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court \n \n1  Plaintiffs  identify  only  two  district  court  decisions  enjoining \nPresidential removal decisions. See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, \n1983 WL 538, at *6 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. \nSupp. 144, 148 (D.D.C. 1993). We vacated Mackie as moot without \nreaching the merits. Mackie v. Clinton, No. 93-5001, 1993 WL \n498033, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 27, 1993). More to the point, both cases \ndirectly contradict Supreme Court precedent recognizing courts lack \nauthority to enjoin the President. See Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. \n(4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1866); Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802–03. \n \n\n6 \nof Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the \nConstitution  and  the  enactment  of  the  original  Judiciary \nAct …. The  substantive  prerequisites  for  obtaining  an \nequitable remedy … depend on traditional principles of equity \njurisdiction.”) (cleaned up); Boyle v. Zacharie, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) \n648, 658 (1832) (“[T]he settled doctrine of this court is, that the \nremedies in equity are to be administered … according to the \npractice of courts of equity in [England].”).  \nNothing  in  Anglo-American  history  supports  the \ninjunctive relief granted by the district court and restored by \nthe en banc majority. Although the injunctions are nominally \ndirected at subordinate executive officials, their purpose and \neffect  are  to  restrain  the  President’s  exercise  of  his \nconstitutional appointment and removal powers. But courts \nhave never possessed authority to “enjoin the President in the \nperformance of his official duties.”2 Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 \nU.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1866); see also Franklin, 505 U.S. at \n827  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (describing  this  limitation  as \n“implicit  in  the  separation  of  powers  established  by  the \nConstitution”).  \n \n2 The Supreme Court has left open the possibility that a court may \nenjoin the President to discharge a ministerial duty, that is, one in \nwhich the President has no discretion. See Johnson, 71 U.S. at 498 \n(reserving the question of whether “the President of the United States \nmay be required, by the process of this court, to perform a purely \nministerial act under a positive law”); Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802 \n(same). The President’s exercise of his appointment and removal \nauthority can in no way be denominated as “ministerial,” however, \nas these powers are essential to his Article II power to control and \nsupervise “those who wield executive power on his behalf.” Seila \nLaw,  140  S.  Ct.  at  2191;  see  also  Johnson,  71  U.S.  at  499 \n(distinguishing  ministerial  duties  from  “purely  executive  and \npolitical” duties).  \n \n\n7 \nEven indulging the fiction that the injunctions are aimed \nonly at subordinate executive officials, equitable remedies of \nthis kind still find no support in our history. At the Founding, \nit appears to have been well-established that a court sitting in \nequity had “no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal \nof public officers.”3 White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) \n(quoting In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888)); see also \nBessent v. Dellinger, 145 S. Ct. 515, 517 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting). The lesson from history is clear: Federal courts \nhave no equitable authority to enjoin the removal or to mandate \nthe reinstatement of executive officers.  \nPerhaps  recognizing  these  limits  on  our  equitable \nauthority, officers challenging their removals have generally \nrefrained  from  seeking  injunctions  mandating  their \nreinstatement.  The  removed  officers  have  instead  brought \nbackpay actions for damages. See, e.g., Wiener, 357 U.S. at \n349–50; Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. at 618; Myers, 272 \nU.S. at 106. The en banc majority binds itself to the mast of \n \n3 Equitable remedies were unavailable because courts of law had \nexclusive jurisdiction to determine title to public office. See In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888); Kalbfus v. Siddons, 42 App. D.C. \n310, 319–21 (1914) (collecting English and American cases granting \nmandamus to restore an unlawfully removed officer). Although the \nSupreme Court has more recently stated that courts are “not totally \nwithout authority to grant interim injunctive relief” directing the \nreinstatement of wrongfully terminated federal employees, see, e.g., \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 63 (1974), such cases do not \nnecessarily  raise  the  same  constitutional  concerns  as  judicial \nreinstatement of an officer removed by the President. Even in cases \ninvolving mere employees, the Court has warned that an injunction \nwill issue only upon a heightened showing. Id. at 83–84. Insofar as \nthese decisions go beyond the scope of equity jurisdiction at the time \nof the Founding, they conflict with the Supreme Court’s more recent \nholding in Grupo. See 527 U.S. at 318–19. \n \n\n8 \nHumphrey’s  Executor  and  Wiener  with  respect  to  the \nconstitutional merits but says nothing about these precedents \non the question of remedies.  \n* * * \nFinally, the district court and Judge Millett in her panel \ndissent  suggest  Harris  and  Wilcox  could  secure  a  writ  of \nmandamus  if  injunctive  relief  were  unavailable.  But  it  is \nextremely unlikely  that mandamus could issue to reinstate \nofficers removed by the President.  \nAs a threshold matter, against whom would mandamus lie? \nThese cases seem to present two options: The court could issue \nmandamus against the President to reinstate the officers, or it \ncould issue mandamus against everyone else in the Executive \nBranch to act as if the President has reinstated the officers. The \ndistrict  court  here  would  apparently  have  done  the  latter, \ndirecting various principal officers and their subordinates—but \nnot the President—to recognize that Harris and Wilcox remain \nin office.4 See Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *15; Wilcox, 2025 \nWL 720914, at *16 n.22. A writ of mandamus, however, may \nbe issued only when an official violates a “clear duty to act.” \nMuthana v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 893, 910 (D.C. Cir. 2021). No \nExecutive Branch officer or employee, not even the Treasury \n \n4 Although our decision in Swan v. Clinton contemplates that de facto \nreinstatement  via  mandamus  issued  against  Executive  Branch \nofficials  may  be  available,  that  determination  was made  in the \ncontext of finding redressability for the purposes of standing. The \ncourt  denied  relief  on  the  merits,  so  it  never  imposed  this \nextraordinary relief. See 100 F.3d 973, 976–81, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1996); \nsee also Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042–43 (D.C. Cir. 2023) \n(reaffirming Swan’s redressability analysis). Moreover, Swan says \nnothing about when it would be appropriate to impose mandamus. \nIn any event, the en banc court is not bound by Swan’s analysis. \n \n\n9 \nSecretary or the Chairman of the NLRB, could have violated a \nclear duty because no officer or employee removed Harris or \nWilcox—the President did. If mandamus were to issue against \nthese officers, there would be a complete mismatch between \nthe  supposedly  unlawful  removal  and  the  officers  being \ntargeted with mandamus.  \nThat leaves the President. Judge Millett argued in dissent \nthat mandamus could issue against the President because he \n“violated a non-discretionary statutory duty by firing Harris \nand Wilcox without relevant justification.” See Harris, 2025 \nWL 980278, at *45 (Millett, J., dissenting). It is extremely \ndoubtful that mandamus could issue against the President. \nWhile this court has at times claimed authority to issue writs of \nmandamus against the President, I am aware of no case in \nwhich we have taken this extraordinary step. To the contrary, \nwe have repeatedly declined to issue the writ “in order to show \nthe  utmost  respect  to  the  office  of  the  Presidency  and  to \navoid … any clash between the judicial and executive branches \nof the Government.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 \nF.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974); see also Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n \nv. United States, 626 F.2d 917, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (declining \nto issue mandamus against the President). \nEven if mandamus could lie against the President, it is \nunlikely Harris and Wilcox could have established a “clear \nright to relief.” Muthana, 985 F.3d at 910. Given the substantial \nquestions regarding whether Humphrey’s Executor remains \ngood law, it is hard to see how the plaintiffs could have shown \ntheir removal from office “was so plainly and palpably wrong \nas [a] matter of law that the writ should issue.” United States \nex  rel.  Chicago  Great  W.  R.  Co.  v.  Interstate  Commerce \nComm’n, 294 U.S. 50, 61 (1935). Moreover, Harris and Wilcox \nhave failed to identify a single case in which mandamus has \nbeen granted when an officer contests his removal by the \n \n\n10 \nPresident. At a minimum, the fact that such a remedy has never \nbeen  imposed,  much  less  against  the  President,  is  good \nevidence that Harris and Wilcox do not have a clear entitlement \nto the writ. \nFurthermore,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  mandamus  to \nreinstate  officers  removed  by  the  President  could  ever  be \nappropriate. “Although the remedy by mandamus is at law, its \nallowance is controlled by equitable principles, and it may be \nrefused for reasons comparable to those” governing a court of \nequity. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U.S. 352, \n359  (1933)  (cleaned  up).  For  this  court  to  order  the \nperformance  of  executive  acts  vested  exclusively  in  the \nPresident would “at best create[] an unseemly appearance of \nconstitutional tension and at worst risk[] a violation of the \nconstitutional separation of powers.” Swan, 100 F.3d at 978; \nsee also Johnson, 71 U.S. at 499 (rebuffing the idea of ordering \nthe President to perform executive acts as “an absurd and \nexcessive extravagance”) (cleaned up). These constitutional \nconcerns render mandamus—an extraordinary writ—wholly \ninappropriate in these removal cases. \n* * * \nThe Constitution creates three co-equal departments of \ngovernment,  each  with  an  independent  responsibility  to \ninterpret  and  uphold  the  Constitution.  While  courts  must \nfaithfully exercise their duty to say what the law is, in choosing \nremedies, courts historically have afforded every measure of \nrespect to the President. Sound judgment demands that when \ncontemplating  coercive  process  against  the  Executive,  the \ncourts take account of the “enduring consequences upon the \nbalanced power structure of our Republic.” Youngstown Sheet \n& Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 634 (1952) (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  \n \n\n11 \nWithout considering the difficult questions regarding the \nscope of the court’s equitable or legal authority, the en banc \nmajority blesses the district court’s unprecedented injunctions \nand  purports  to  reinstate  principal  officers  ousted  by  the \nPresident. In so doing, the majority threatens to send this court \nheadlong into a clash with the Executive. I respectfully dissent. \n \n\n \nWALKER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  \n \nHaving explained my views previously, I add only this: In \nPHH v. CFPB, the en banc court said that the Supreme Court \nwould need to narrow Humphrey’s Executor in order to hold \nthat  the  CFPB’s  removal  restrictions  are  unconstitutional.1  \nThen, in Seila Law, the Supreme Court held those restrictions \nunconstitutional.2  So by the PHH majority’s own reasoning, \nthe outcome in Seila Law depended on the Supreme Court \nnarrowing Humphrey’s Executor.   \n \nPerhaps  the  members  of  today’s  en  banc  majority \nrecognize that Humphrey’s Executor cannot be read as broadly \nas it once could but disagree with the panel in this case about \nhow  much  it  has  been  narrowed.    If  so,  it  is  hollow  and \nhyperbolic for today’s majority to proclaim, “The Supreme \n \n1  See  881  F.3d  75,  93  (D.C.  Cir.  2018)  (“There  is  nothing \nconstitutionally  suspect  about  the  CFPB’s  leadership  structure. \nMorrison and Humphrey’s Executor stand in the way of any holding \nto the contrary.”); id. at 113 (Tatel, J., concurring, joined by Millett, \nJ., and Pillard, J.) (“PHH is free to ask the Supreme Court to revisit \nHumphrey’s Executor and Morrison, but that argument has no truck \nin a circuit court of appeals.”); id. at 118 (Wilkins, J., concurring, \njoined by Rogers, J.) (“the dissenters seek to overcome the precedent \nupholding  tenure  protection  for  officers  with  significant  quasi-\njudicial and quasi-legislative responsibilities”). \nSimilarly, in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, the majority said \nthe “bulk of the Fund’s challenge to the Act was fought — and \nlost — over seventy years ago when the Supreme Court decided \nHumphrey’s Executor.”  537 F.3d 667, 685 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The \nSupreme Court disagreed.  Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 \nU.S. 477, 514 (2010) (“While we have sustained in certain cases \nlimits on the President’s removal power, the Act before us imposes \na new type of restriction — two levels of protection from removal \nfor those who nonetheless exercise significant executive power. \nCongress cannot limit the President’s authority in this way.”). \n2 Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2197 (2020). \n \n\n2 \nCourt has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant \nSupreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself \nchanges it or overturns it.”  Each of us recognizes that a lower \ncourt  cannot  overrule  Humphrey’s  Executor.    We  simply \ndisagree about how broadly to read it. \n \n  \n ",

The Merit Systems Protection Board is an independent federal agency. Plaintiff \nCathy A. Harris has been a Member of the Merit Systems Protection Board since June 1, 2022, \nfollowing her nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. She is entitled to \ncontinue to serve as a Member of the Merit Systems Protection Board for the remainder of her \nterm until March 1, 2028 and may be removed by  the  President  “only  for  inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d). \n2.  On  February  10,  2025,  President  Trump  disregarded  that  clear  statutory \nlanguage and, in a one-sentence email, purported to terminate Ms. Harris. That email made no \nattempt to comply with the statute’s for-cause removal protection. It stated simply: “On behalf of \nPresident Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems \nProtection Board is terminated, effective immediately.” \n3.  President Trump’s purported removal of Ms. Harris is unlawful. It has no basis \nin fact and thus cannot be squared with the statutory text. And it is in direct conflict with \nnearly a century of precedent that defines the standard for removal of independent agency \nofficials  and  upholds  the  legality  of  virtually  identical  for-cause  removal  protections  for \nmembers of independent agencies. \n4.  As a Member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, Ms. Harris brings this \naction against President Trump, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, \nthe Acting Chairman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nand the Office of Management and Budget, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunction and, \non an emergency basis, a temporary restraining order to prevent the deprivation of her statutory \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 12\nentitlement to exercise the duties of her office. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action for declaratory \nand injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361. \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \n \nPARTIES \n \n7.  Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris is a Member of the United States Merit Systems \nProtection Board. \n8.  Defendant Scott Bessent is the Secretary of the Treasury. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n9.  Defendant Trent Morse is the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy \nDirector of the White House Presidential Personnel Office. He is sued in his official capacity. \n10.  Defendant Sergio Gor is the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel \nOffice. He is sued in his official capacity. \n11.  Defendant  Henry  J.  Kerner  is  the  Acting  Chairman  of  the  Merit  Systems \nProtection Board. He is sued in his official capacity. \n12.  Defendant  Donald  J.  Trump  is  the  President  of  the  United  States  and  is \nresponsible for the decision to remove Ms. Harris from her office. He is sued in his official \ncapacity. \n13.  Defendant Russell Vought is the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget. He is sued in his official capacity. \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \n \n14.  The Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) is an independent agency of the \nUnited States. In 1978, Congress first established the MSPB as part  of the Civil  Service \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 4 of 12\nReform Act of 1978 (“CSRA”), PL 95–454 (S 2640), 92 Stat. 1111 (Oct. 13, 1978). The \nCSRA was enacted to address widespread public concerns about the federal civil service.1 \n15.  The legislation that became the CSRA was first proposed by President Carter. \nIn a letter to Congress, President Carter requested that Congress create the MSPB, whose \nmembers would be removable only for cause. President Carter explained that this structure was \nintended  to  “guarantee  independent  and  impartial  protection  to  employees”  and  thereby \n“safeguard the rights of Federal employees who ‘blow the whistle’ on violations of laws or \nregulations by other employees, including their supervisors.”2 \n16.  Over the following seven months, Congress worked to formulate President \nCarter’s proposal into final legislation. Throughout these deliberations, Congress emphasized \nthe importance  of  an  independent  MSPB  with  sufficient  authority  to  protect  the  federal \nworkforce consistent with merit system principles. To ensure that independence, Congress in \nthe CSRA provided that the Members of the MSPB “may be removed by the President only \nfor inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Civil Service Reform Act, P.L. 95-\n454, 92 Stat. 1111, Ch. 12, § 1202. \n17.  On October 13, 1978, President Carter signed the CSRA into law, declaring that \nthe “landmark legislation” would create “a new system of excellence and accountability.”3 \n18.  The MSPB’s primary mission is to provide the people of the United States with \na  competent,  honest,  and  productive  Federal  workforce,  provide  that  Federal  personnel \n \n1 The Civil Service and the Statutory Law of Public Employment, 97 Harv.

Members  of  the  Board  are  empowered  to  order  any  Federal  agency  or \nemployee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board and enforce compliance \nwith any such order. 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(1)-(2). \n20.  Members  of  the  MSPB  are  to  conduct,  from  time  to  time,  special  studies \nrelating to the civil service and to other merit systems in the executive branch, and report to the \nPresident and to the Congress as to whether the public interest in a civil service free of \nprohibited personnel practices is being adequately protected. 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(3). \n21.  Members of the MSPB are required to review rules and regulations of the \nOffice of Personnel Management. 5 U.S.C. § 1204(a)(4). \n22.  A Member of the MSPB must be nominated by the President and confirmed by \nthe  Senate.  Members  of  the  MSPB  must  also  be  “individuals  who,  by  demonstrated  ability, \nbackground, training, or experience are especially qualified to carry out the functions of the Board.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1201. \n23.  Once confirmed, a Member of the MSPB serves a seven-year term and, if a \nsuccessor has  not  yet  been  appointed,  up  to  one  additional  year.  “Any  member  may  be \nremoved by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1202. \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 6 of 12\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \n24.  On or about June 24, 2021, President Biden nominated Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris \nto be a Member of the MSPB.4 Ms. Harris was renominated by President Biden to be a \nMember of the MSPB on January 4, 2022. The Senate confirmed Ms. Harris on May 25, 2022, \nand she was sworn in as a Member of the Board on June 1, 2022.5 Ms. Harris’s term expires \non March 1, 2028. \n25.  President Biden designated Ms. Harris as Vice Chairman of the MSPB on June \n6, 2022, and she served as Acting Chairman of the MSPB until March 6, 2024. The Senate \nconfirmed Ms. Harris as Chairman on March 6, 2024. Ms. Harris was sworn in as Chairman of \nthe MSPB on March 14, 2024.6 \n26.  On February 11, 2025, Ms. Harris received an email from Trent Morse, Deputy \nAssistant to the President and the Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel \nOffice, which stated in its entirety: “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to \ninform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective \nimmediately. Thank you for your service[.]” Ex. A. \n27.  The one-sentence email does not allege any inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office by Ms. Harris, nor is there any basis for such an allegation.7  In flagrant \n \n4 MSPB Annual Report for FY 2021, Merit Systems Protection Board (Feb. 18, 2022), \nhttps://www.mspb.gov/about/annual_reports/MSPB_FY_2021_Annual_Report_1900943.pdf. \n5 MSPB Welcomes Acting Chairman Cathy A.

In addition to new matters, when Ms. Harris joined \n  15 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 7 of 12\ndisregard for the clear statutory text, Ms. Harris was purportedly terminated without basis, \njustification or authority. \n28.  The MSPB’s ability to protect the civil service is needed now more than ever. \nOver the preceding three weeks, an unprecedented number of federal employees with civil \nservice protections have been placed on administrative leave with a threat that their due \nprocess rights and civil service protections will be taken away.8 Senior career officials have \nbeen purged from the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Eighteen Inspectors General from \nacross  the  federal  government  have  been  removed  without  the  justification  required  by \nstatute.9 And hundreds of federal employees have been locked out of their computer systems \nby the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization.10 \n29.  The President has also attempted to remove Board Member Gwynne Wilcox \nfrom the National Labor Relations Board and Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger despite \nclear statutory for-cause removal protection.11 \n \nthe MSPB, the Board inherited a case inventory at headquarters of 3793 cases which had \naccumulated over a five-year period during which the MSPB did not have a quorum of Members. \nAs of January 1, 2025, the Board had issued decisions on 4620 cases, with only 56 cases from \nthe inherited inventory remaining pending.

The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n \n32.  Ms. Harris has a clear entitlement to remain in her office. Once confirmed by \nthe Senate, a Member of the MSPB serves a seven-year term. 5 U.S.C. § 1202. A Member of \nthe MSPB may be removed from that term “by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office.” Id. \n33.  The  constitutionality  of  that  protection  is  dictated  by  nearly  a  century  of \nbinding  Supreme  Court  precedent  upholding  materially  identical  restrictions.  Humphrey’s \nExecutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 620 (1935); Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, \n356 (1958).  \n34.  President  Trump’s  purported  termination  of  Ms.  Harris  is  unlawful.  The \nPresident did not purport to remove Ms. Harris on the basis of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, \nor malfeasance in office.” In fact, the President’s termination email provided no justification at \nall for the termination. \n35.  As a result, the President’s termination of Ms. Harris is ultra  vires and is a clear \n \nNew York Times (Feb. 10, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/10/us/trump-news/a-\njudge-blocked-trumps-firing-of-a-government-watchdog. \n12 Allan Smith, ‘Fear’ and ‘chaos’ grip federal workers as Trump rapidly remakes the \ngovernment, NBC News (Jan. 30, 2025), https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fear-\nchaos-grip- federal-workers-trump-remakes-government-rcna189746. \n  15 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 9 of 12\nviolation of the statute. \n \nCOUNT TWO \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1) and 706(2) \n(Against Defendants Bessent, Gor, Morse, Kerner, and Vought) \n \n36.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n \n37.  To  the  extent  that  Defendants  Bessent,  Gor,  Morse,  Kerner,  and  Vought \nexercise authority with respect to, or on behalf of, the Merit Systems Protection Board without \nregard to Ms. Harris’s position as Member, those actions are “not in accordance with the law,” \n“contrary to a constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Ms. Harris \nseeks to hold unlawful and set aside such actions, pursuant to section 706 the Administrative \nProcedure Act and to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. \n \nCOUNT THREE \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \n \n38.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n \n39.  Ms. Harris is entitled to declaratory relief on the basis of all claims identified. \nThere is a substantial and ongoing controversy between Ms. Harris and the Defendants, and a \ndeclaration of rights under the Declaratory Judgment Act is both necessary and appropriate to \nestablish that Ms. Harris is a Member of the MSPB and that the President does not have \nauthority to remove her absent inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. \n \nCOUNT FOUR \nVIOLATION OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS \n \n40.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n \n41.  President Trump’s purported removal of Ms. Harris is further invalid because it \n  15 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 10 of 12\nviolates Article I, section 8 and Article II, sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Constitution. The \nConstitution empowers Congress to set reasonable limitations on the removal of the heads of \nindependent agencies and it does not confer on the President an authority to violate Congress’s \nscheme. The President’s purported removal of Ms. Harris violates the authorities vested in \nCongress by the Constitution and further violates the President’s duty to “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.” \nCOUNT FIVE \nWRIT OF MANDAMUS \n \n42.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n \n43.  In the alternative, Ms. Harris is entitled to a writ of mandamus. The MSPB \nstatute’s  removal  restrictions  impose  a  ministerial  duty  on  the  President  and subordinate \nofficials not to interfere with Ms. Harris’s tenure in office absent cause for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office. See Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 977-78 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \n44.  Ms. Harris is entitled to a writ of mandamus prohibiting her removal from \noffice and, absent this Court granting one of the counts identified above, there is no other \nadequate means of redress. \n \nCOUNT SIX \nEQUITABLE RELIEF FOR STATUTORY AND \nCONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS \n \n45.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n \n46.  Under this Court’s traditional equitable jurisdiction, the plaintiff is entitled \nto  equitable  relief  to  prevent  and  restrain  ongoing  violations  of  both  statutory  and \nconstitutional federal law by the defendants. Equitable actions have “long been recognized as \nthe proper means” to prevent public officials from acting unconstitutionally. Because such \nactions seek simply to halt or prevent a violation of federal law rather than the award of money \n  15 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-00412     Document 1     Filed 02/11/25     Page 11 of 12\ndamages, they do not ask the Court to imply a new cause of action. To the contrary, the ability \nto sue to enjoin unlawful and unconstitutional actions by federal officers is the creation of \ncourts of equity and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing \nback to England.

      "text": "  Cite as:  605 U. S. ____ (2025)  1 \n \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_________________ \nNo. 24A966 \n_________________ \nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED \nSTATES, ET AL. v. GWYNNE A. WILCOX, ET AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n[May 22, 2025] \n \n  The Government has applied for a stay of orders from the \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia enjoining the \nPresident’s removal of a member of the National Labor Re-\nlations Board (NLRB) and a member of the Merit Systems \nProtection Board (MSPB), respectively.  The President is \nprohibited by statute from removing these officers except \nfor  cause,  and  no  qualifying  cause  was  given.  See  29 \nU. S. C. §153(a); 5 U. S. C. §1202(d).\n  The application for stay presented to THE CHIEF JUSTICE  \nand by him referred to the Court is granted.  Because the \nConstitution vests the executive power in the President, see \nArt. II, §1, cl. 1, he may remove without cause executive of-\nficers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to nar-\nrow exceptions recognized by our precedents, see Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S.  \n197, 215−218 (2020).  The stay reflects our judgment that \nthe Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and \nMSPB exercise considerable executive power.  But we do \nnot ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or \nMSPB falls within such a recognized exception; that ques-\ntion is better left for resolution after full briefing and argu-\nment. The stay also reflects our judgment that the Govern-\nment faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a \nremoved officer to continue exercising the executive power \nthan a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable \nto perform her statutory duty.  See Trump v. International  \n\n2  TRUMP v. WILCOX \n   \n \nRefugee Assistance Project, 582 U. S. 571, 580 (2017) (per  \ncuriam) (“The purpose of . . . interim equitable relief is not \nto conclusively determine the rights of the parties, but to \nbalance the equities as the litigation moves forward.” (cita-\ntion omitted)). A stay is appropriate to avoid the disruptive \neffect of the repeated removal and reinstatement of officers \nduring the pendency of this litigation.   \n  Finally, respondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris \ncontend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate \nthe constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for \nmembers of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or \nother members of the Federal Open Market Committee.  \nSee Response of Wilcox in Opposition to App. for Stay 2−3,  \n27−28; Response of Harris in Opposition to App. for Stay  3, \n5−6, 16−17, 36, 40.  We disagree.  The Federal Reserve is a  \nuniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the \ndistinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks  \nof the United States. See Seila Law, 591 U. S., at 222, n. 8. \n  The March 4, 2025, order of the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, No. 25−cv−412, ECF \nDoc. 39, and the March 6, 2025, order of the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, No. 25−cv−334,  \nECF Doc. 34, are stayed pending the disposition of the ap-\npeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ \nof certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought.  Should certio-\nrari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically.  In  \nthe event certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate \nupon the sending down of the judgment of this Court. \n\n  Cite as:  605 U. S. ____ (2025)  1 \n \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_________________ \nNo. 24A966 \n_________________ \nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED \nSTATES, ET AL. v. GWYNNE A. WILCOX, ET AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n[May 22, 2025] \nJUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and \nJUSTICE JACKSON join, dissenting from the grant of the ap-\nplication for stay. \n  For 90 years, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295  \nU. S. 602 (1935),  has stood as a  precedent of this Court.  \nAnd not just any precedent.  Humphrey’s undergirds a sig-\nnificant feature of American governance: bipartisan admin-\nistrative bodies carrying out expertise-based functions with \na measure of independence from presidential control.  The \ntwo such agencies involved in this application are the Na-\ntional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Merit Systems \nProtection Board (MSPB).  But there are many others—\namong  them,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission \n(FCC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Federal Re-\nserve Board. Congress created them all, though at different\ntimes, out of one basic vision.  It thought that in certain\nspheres of  government, a group of knowledgeable people \nfrom both parties—none of whom a President could remove\nwithout cause—would make decisions likely to advance the \nlong-term public good.  And that congressional judgment,  \nHumphrey’s  makes clear, creates no conflict with the Con-\nstitution. Rejecting a claim that the removal restriction en-\nacted for the FTC interferes with “the executive power,” the \nHumphrey’s Court held that Congress has authority, in cre-\nating such  “quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial” bodies, to \n“forbid their [members’] removal except for cause.”  Id., at \n\n2  TRUMP v. WILCOX \n   \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \n626, 629. Indeed, that conclusion “cannot well be doubted.”   \nId., at 629; see also Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349  \n(1958) (reaffirming Humphrey’s). \n  The current President believes that Humphrey’s should  \nbe either overruled or confined.  See Application 14; Letter\nfrom S. Harris, Acting Solicitor General, to Rep. J. Raskin, \nRe: Restrictions on the Removal of Certain Principal Offic-\ners of the United States (Feb. 12, 2025).  And he has chosen  \nto act on that belief—really, to take the law into his own \nhands. Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, \nwithout a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from \na classic independent agency—a multi-member, bipartisan \ncommission exercising regulatory power whose governing \nstatute contains a for-cause provision.  Yet now the Presi-\ndent  has  discharged,  concededly  without  cause,  several \nsuch officers, including a member of the NLRB (Gwynne \nWilcox) and a member of the MSPB (Cathy Harris).  Today, \nthis Court effectively blesses those deeds.  I would not.  Our \nHumphrey’s  decision remains good law, and it forecloses\nboth the President’s firings and the Court’s decision to  \naward emergency relief. \n  Our emergency docket, while fit for some things, should \nnot be used to overrule or revise existing law.  We consider \nemergency applications “on a short fuse without benefit of \nfull briefing and oral argument”; and we resolve them with-\nout fully (or at all) stating our reasons.  Does 1–3 v. Mills, \n595 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (BARRETT,  J., concurring in denial \nof application for injunctive relief ) (slip op., at 1).  It is one  \n \nthing to grant relief in that way when doing so vindicates \nestablished legal rights, which somehow the courts below \nhave disregarded.  It is a wholly different thing to skip the \nusual appellate process when issuing an order that itself \nchanges the law.  See,  e.g.,  Netchoice, LLC v. Paxton, 596 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2022) (ALITO,  J., dissenting from grant of ap-\nplication to vacate stay) (slip op., at 2) (demanding that an \napplicant for relief have a good claim “under existing law”);  \n\n  Cite as:  605 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \nMerrill  v. Milligan, 595 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (ROBERTS,  \nC. J., dissenting from grant of applications for stays) (slip \nop., at 1) (same); id., 595 U. S., at ___ (KAGAN, J., dissenting \nfrom grant of applications for stays) (slip op., at 1) (same).  \nAnd nowhere is short-circuiting our deliberative process \nless appropriate than when the ruling requested would dis-\nrespect—by either overturning or narrowing—one of this \nCourt’s longstanding precedents, like our nearly century-\nold Humphrey’s decision.  \n  Under that  decision, this case is easy, as the courts below \nfound: The President has no legal right to relief.  Congress, \nby statute, has protected members of the NLRB and MSPB \n(like Wilcox and Harris) from Presidential removal except \nfor good cause. See 29 U. S. C. §153(a) (permitting removal \nonly for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office”); 5 U. S. C. \n§1202(d) (permitting removal only for “inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office”).  And, again, Humphrey’s  \ninstructs that Congress can do so without offending the\nConstitution. Just like the agency  at issue there (the FTC), \nthe NLRB and MSPB are multi-member bodies of experts, \nbalanced along partisan lines, with “quasi-legislative or \nquasi-judicial” (not “purely executive”) functions.  Humph-\nrey’s, 295 U.  S., at 628,  631; see Seila Law LLC v. Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S. 197, 204, 216–217  \n(2020).  So both fit securely within the ambit of Humph-\nrey’s—as no one in the history of either agency has ever\ndoubted.  That means to fire their members, the Presi-\ndent—under existing law—needs good cause, which he ad-\nmits he does not have.  The only way out of that box is to \nupend Humphrey’s. \n  For that reason, the majority’s order granting the Presi-\ndent’s request for a stay is nothing short of extraordinary.  \nThat order consents to the President’s (statutorily barred) \nremoval of the NLRB and MSPB Commissioners, at least \nuntil we decide their suits on the merits.  And so the order  \nallows the President to overrule Humphrey’s  by fiat, again  \n\n4  TRUMP v. WILCOX \n   \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \npending our eventual review.  This Court often reminds  \nother judges that if one of our precedents “has direct appli-\ncation in a case,” they must follow it, even if they dislike \nit—“leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its \nown decisions.” Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American  \nExpress, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).  In keeping with \nthat directive, lower courts recently faced with challenges \nto  independent  agencies’  removal  provisions  have  uni-\nformly rejected them based on Humphrey’s.  See, e.g.,  Con-\nsumers’ Research  v. Consumer Product Safety Comm’n, 91 \nF. 4th 342, 346 (CA5 2024) (Willett, J.) (“As middle-man-\nagement circuit judges, we must follow binding precedent,” \nwhich  Humphrey’s   remains);  Leachco,  Inc.  v.  Consumer  \nProduct Safety Comm’n, 103 F. 4th 748, 760–763 (CA10  \n2024)  (similar);  Meta  Platforms,  Inc.  v.  FTC,  2024  WL \n1549732, *2 (CADC, Mar. 29, 2024) (per curiam) (similar).  \nIt should go without saying that the President must like-\nwise follow existing precedent, however strong he thinks \nthe arguments against it—unless and until he convinces us \nto reject what we previously held.  Yet here the President \nfired the NLRB and MSPB Commissioners in the teeth of  \nHumphrey’s, betting that this Court would acquiesce.  And \nthe majority today obliges—without so much as mentioning \nHumphrey’s. \n  The majority’s explanation of its action unfolds in two \nparts, neither rising to the occasion.\n  The first gestures toward the merits, but in a most unu-\nsual and unedifying way.  Our normal (invariable?) practice\nis to grant a stay pending appeal only when we decide the \napplicant is likely to succeed on the merits.  See, e.g.,  Hol-\nlingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam).\nBut the majority’s order purports not to reach that conclu-\nsion.  According to the majority, the President may remove \nwithout cause officers exercising executive power, “subject \nto narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.”  Ante,  \nat 1.  The majority will not say the name of the relevant \n\n  Cite as:  605 U. S. ____ (2025)  5 \n \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \nprecedent, but one of those “exceptions” of course comes \nfrom Humphrey’s.  See Seila Law, 591 U. S., at 204, 215– \n217.  The question thus becomes: Does Humphrey’s protect \nthe NLRB and MSPB Commissioners?  Well, the majority\nsays, those officers likely exercise “considerable executive \npower”; but whether they fall within “a recognized excep-\ntion”—i.e., Humphrey’s—is better left for the future.  Ante,  \nat 1.  So the majority’s  order just restates the question this \ncase raises—despite the need to give a preliminary answer \nbefore  ordering  relief.  Unless  . . .  unless  the  majority  \nthinks it has provided a hint.  Maybe by saying that the \nCommissioners  exercise  “considerable”  executive  power, \nthe majority is suggesting that they cannot fall within the \nHumphrey’s  “exception.”  But if that is what the majority \nmeans, then it has foretold a massive change in the law—\nreducing Humphrey’s  to nothing and depriving members of\nthe NLRB, MSPB, and many other independent agencies of \ntenure protections.  And it has done so on the emergency \ndocket, with little time, scant briefing, and no argument. \n  The second part of the majority’s explanation, focusing on \nwhat we typically call the balance of equities, in no way \ncompensates for the first’s failures.  Here, the majority rea-\nsons that a stay is justified because the interests at stake \nare  lopsided.  “[T]he  Government,”  it  declares,  “faces\ngreater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed of-\nficer to continue exercising the executive power than a \nwrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to per-\nform her statutory duty.”  Ante, at 1.  But that statement \nmisapprehends, on both sides, what this case involves.\n  On the latter side, the relevant interest is not the “wrong-\nfully removed officer[s’],” but rather Congress’s and, more \nbroadly, the public’s.  What matters, in other words, is not \nthat Wilcox and Harris would love to keep serving in their \nnifty jobs. What matters instead is that Congress provided \nfor them to serve their full terms, protected from a Presi-\ndent’s desire to substitute his political allies.  See Wiener, \n\n6  TRUMP v. WILCOX \n   \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \n357 U. S., at 354.   Or differently put, the interest at stake \nis in maintaining Congress’s idea of independent agencies: \nbodies of specialists balanced along partisan lines, which \nwill make sound judgments precisely because not fully con-\ntrolled by the White House. Even without Humphrey’s, this \nCourt would have to give respect, in balancing equities, to \nCongress’s  expression  of  that  idea  in  legislation.    See \nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U. S. 1301,  \n1302 (1993) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers) (Acts of Con-\ngress “should remain in effect pending a final decision on \nthe merits by this Court”); Walters v. National Assn. of Ra-\ndiation Survivors, 468 U. S. 1323, 1324 (1984) (Rehnquist, \nJ.,  in  chambers)  (“The  presumption  of  constitutionality\nwhich attaches to every Act of Congress” is “an equity to be \nconsidered” in the stay analysis).  And of course the Court \nis not without Humphrey’s, which already approved the \nkind of removal restrictions at issue here.  Given that deci-\nsion—and the near-century of administrative practice that \nhas followed—the majority has no excuse for so misidenti-\nfying the interest that cuts against unconstrained removal.  \nIt is, again, the interest in the NLRB, MSPB, and all their \nilk working as Congress intended them to, on the view that \na measure of independence would serve the public good.\n  And on the former side of the balance, the majority dis-\ntorts and overstates the interest in preventing Wilcox and \nHarris from continuing in office.  That interest, to begin\nwith, is not “the Government[’s],” ante, at 1, but only the  \nPresident’s.  Congress, after all, is also part of the Govern-\nment, and (as just noted) its equities lie in preserving the \nlegislation it has enacted to limit removals.  And as to the  \nPresident’s interest in firing Wilcox and Harris, the major-\nity gives it more weight than it has borne in almost a cen-\ntury.  Between Humphrey’s and now, 14 different Presi-\ndents  have  lived  with  Congress’s  restrictions  on  firing\nmembers of independent agencies.  No doubt many would\nhave preferred it otherwise.  But can it really be said, after \n\n  Cite as:  605 U. S. ____ (2025)  7 \n \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \nall this time, that the President has a crying need to dis-\ncharge independent agency members right away—before \nthis Court (surely next Term) decides the fate of Humph-\nrey’s on the merits?  The impatience to get on with things— \nto now hand the President the most unitary, meaning also \nthe most subservient, administration since Herbert Hoover  \n(and maybe ever)—must reveal how that eventual decision \nwill go.  In valuing so highly—in an emergency posture—\nthe President’s ability to fire without cause Wilcox and Har-\nris and everyone like them, the majority all but declares  \nHumphrey’s  itself the emergency.* \n  Except apparently for the Federal Reserve.  The majority \ncloses today’s order by stating, out of the blue, that it has\nno bearing on “the constitutionality of for-cause removal \nprotections” for members of the Federal Reserve Board or \nOpen Market Committee.  Ante, at 2.  I am glad to hear it, \nand do not doubt the majority’s intention to avoid imperil-\ning the Fed. But then, today’s order poses a puzzle.  For the \nFederal Reserve’s independence rests on the same constitu-\ntional  and  analytic  foundations  as  that  of  the  NLRB,  \nMSPB,  FTC, FCC, and so on—which is to say it rests largely  \non Humphrey’s.  So the majority has to offer a different \nstory: The Federal Reserve, it submits, is a “uniquely struc-\ntured” entity with a “distinct historical tradition”—and it \ncites for that proposition footnote 8 of this Court’s opinion \nin Seila Law.  Ante, at 2 (citing 591 U. S., at 222, n. 8).  \nBut—sorry—footnote 8 provides no support.  Its only rele-\nvant sentence rejects an argument made in the dissenting \n—————— \n*The majority also justifies its stay on the ground that it will “avoid \nthe disruptive effect of the repeated removal and reinstatement of offic-\ners during the pendency of this litigation.”   Ante, at 2.  But that reason, \ntoo, gives the ultimate game away.  As this case came to us, Wilcox and  \nHarris had been reinstated to their positions, by the combined rulings of \nthe district and appellate courts.  So by re-removing them, the majority’s \norder itself causes  disruption—except, of course, if that order presumes \nor implies that they will be re-removed next Term anyway. \n\n8  TRUMP v. WILCOX \n   \nKAGAN,  J., dissenting \nopinion “even assuming [that] financial institutions like the \nSecond Bank and Federal Reserve can claim a special his-\ntorical status.” And so an assumption made to humor a dis-\nsent gets turned into some kind of holding.  Because one  \nway of making new law on the emergency docket (the dep-\nrecation of Humphrey’s) turns out to require yet another \n(the creation of a bespoke Federal Reserve exception).  If  \nthe idea is to reassure the markets, a simpler—and more \njudicial—approach would have been to deny the President’s \napplication for a stay on the continued authority of Humph-\nrey’s.  \n  “To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts,” Hamilton \nwrote, “it is indispensable that they should be bound down \nby strict rules and precedents.”  Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J.\nCooke ed. 1961).  Today’s order, however, favors the Presi-\ndent over our precedent; and it does so unrestrained by the \nrules of briefing and argument—and the passage of time—\nneeded to discipline our decision-making.  I would deny the \nPresident’s application.  I would do so based on the will of \nCongress, this Court’s seminal decision approving inde-\npendent agencies’ for-cause protections, and the ensuing 90 \nyears of this Nation’s history.  Respectfully, I dissent. ",
