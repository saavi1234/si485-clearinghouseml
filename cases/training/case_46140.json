DOS claimed these actions were consistent with President Trump&rsquo;s January 20, 2025 Executive Order 14169 &ldquo;Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid&rdquo; (EO 14169).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)&mdash;a non-governmental participant in USRAP&mdash; received a letter stating that USCCB&rsquo;s funding awards were immediately &ldquo;suspended pending a Department-wide review of foreign assistance programs&rdquo; to determine whether awards would be continued, modified, or terminated. (See Exhibit A of the Complaint available on the Clearinghouse). On February 18, 2025, brought this lawsuit against DOS and its Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (DOS PRM), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in United States District Court for the District of Columbia under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 702 (APA). HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) was later added as a defendant in an amended complaint on March 3, 2025. The plaintiff claimed that the suspension of their funds under Trump&rsquo;s EO 14169 and DOS Secretary Marco Rubio&rsquo;s resulting memorandum (&ldquo;Rubio memo&rdquo;), that ordered pausing of all DOS and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding pending review, violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Impoundment Control Act, and the U.S. constitution&rsquo;s separation of powers. Represented by law firm Gibson Dunn, the plaintiff sought declaratory relief; temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief against enforcement the suspension, EO 14169, and the Rubio Memo and reimbursement of costs; attorneys&rsquo; fees; and any other appropriate relief. On February 19, 2025, the case was assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali and then reassigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.</p>\r\n<p>On February 19, 2025, USCCB filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. The next day, the court held a hearing on the motion and denied only the temporary restraining order for failure to make make a &ldquo;clear showing that four factors, taken together, warrant relief: likely success on the merits, likely irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and accord with the public interest.&rdquo; (quoting League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016)). Additionally, the court set an expedited schedule for additional briefing on the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for a preliminary injunction and referred the case to Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey for in-person mediation.</p>\r\n<p>On February 27, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Change of Material Facts, alerting the court that the defendants had terminated their &ldquo;cooperative agreements&rdquo; with the plaintiff via letters sent to the plaintiff the previous day. Those letters read: &ldquo;[DOS] hereby notifies the recipient that this award is immediately terminated as of February 27, 2025. This award no longer effectuates agency priorities . . ..&rdquo; Pointing to their termination of the agreements with the plaintiff, the defendants argued that the case had, thus, become only a contract dispute about money. Accordingly, they argued that the case was no longer in the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for D.C. but rather was in the sole jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.</p>\r\n<p>After further briefing, on February 28, 2025, the court heard plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for preliminary injunction. Rather than ruling on it, the court set a schedule for plaintiff to file an amended complaint and amended preliminary injunction and for defendants response.</p>\r\n<p>On March 3, 2025, plaintiff filed an amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and an amended motion for preliminary injunction. (The court deemed the plaintiff&rsquo;s previous, February 19, 2025, motion for preliminary injunction moot). In the amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants&rsquo; termination of their cooperative agreements with the plaintiff were unlawful and re-alleged that the award suspensions were unlawful. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff&rsquo;s amended motion for PI sought to prohibit the defendants from suspending their awards and terminating their cooperative agreements.</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the preliminary injunction on March 11, explaining that the plaintiff was seeking a contractual remedy rather than an equitable one like an injunction. It held that under the Tucker Act, such a contract dispute with the government must be dealt with in the Court of Federal Claims&mdash;not in the district court. 770 F.Supp.3d 155.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 12, 2025, the plaintiff appealed the district court's denial of relief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (docket no. 25-05066), and the next day, moved in the district court for an emergency injunction pending the appeal. Judge McFadden denied the emergency injunction on March 14, reiterating that the district court could not issue the requested relief as it lacked jurisdiction over contractual remedies. 2025 WL 1745209.</p>\r\n<p>On March 14, 2025, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion in the appellate court, seeking an injunction pending appeal \"requiring the government to fulfill its statutory and regulatory obligations under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1522 to provide resettlement assistance to refugees already present in the United States.\" USCCB also sought an expedited hearing on the merits of the district court's denial of the plaintiff's PI motion by March 28, 2025, \"when additional layoffs take effect.\" That same day, the appellate court denied an injunction pending appeal; one of the three judges dissented, finding that, contrary to the district court's findings, \"the claims in the complaint are not questions the district court can answer by examining a contractual promise made by the government to the Conference,\" and that \"the relief the Conference seeks is traditional equitable and declaratory relief&mdash;the mainstay of APA actions,\" not contract actions. Therefore, the dissenting judge would have granted the Conference's request for a preliminary injunction. After the ruling, on April 24, the parties moved to dismiss the appeal voluntarily. The court agreed and dismissed the case on May 2.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, on April 21, 2025, the government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the government has not waived sovereign immunity and, in the alternative, the plaintiffs' claims are moot.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, at the request of the parties, the district court stayed all deadlines in the case but ordered the parties to file a status report on September 28, 2025. In their consent motion to stay the proceedings, the parties reported they had come to an agreement to &ldquo;wind down the [palintiff&rsquo;s] participation in the government's refugee resettlement program.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On September 26, 2025 the joint status report was filed. In the report, plaintiffs&rsquo; state that the U.S. The Department approved plaintiffs' request to terminate their participation in the program and set a due date of September 29, 2025 for plaintiffs&rsquo; final reports and payment requests. Plaintiffs&rsquo; report they are close to completing their materials to submit to the Department.</p>\r\n<p>The parties plan on submitting another status report 60 days after the September 26, 2025 report.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

      "title": "Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction",
      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00465-AHA     Document 5     Filed 02/19/25     Page 1 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n \nUNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF   \nCATHOLIC BISHOPS,   \n \nPlaintiff, \nCase No. 1:25-cv-465\n \nv. \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nSTATE, et al. \nDefendants. \n \n \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING  \nORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nThe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (“USCCB”) moves for a temporary re-\nstraining order and preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants and their agents from unlawfully \nsuspending funding for USCCB’s refugee resettlement services, which for decades have provided \nessential, statutorily mandated assistance to recently arrived refugees pursuant to cooperative \nagreements between USCCB and the government (the “Refugee Funding Suspension”).   \nUSCCB respectfully requests that the Court resolve its request for a temporary restraining \norder on an expedited basis.  Given the irreparable harm caused by the Refugee Funding Suspen-\nsion, the balance of the equities, and USCCB’s likelihood of success, there is good cause for the \nCourt to hold a hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order expeditiously and to con-\nsider ruling on that request by Friday, February 21, 2025.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a).  USCCB \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-AHA     Document 5     Filed 02/19/25     Page 2 of 5\nsupports this motion with its complaint, the memorandum filed concurrently with this motion, and \nthe accompanying declarations and exhibits. \nAs explained in the accompanying memorandum, USCCB satisfies the standards for pre-\nliminary relief.  USCCB is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims.  The sudden and indefinite \nsuspension of funding for statutorily mandated refugee assistance is unlawful for multiple inde-\npendent reasons.  First, it contravenes the Refugee Act’s requirement to spend appropriated funds \non specified forms of refugee assistance, and the Impoundment Control Act’s procedural and sub-\nstantive limitations—flouting the Constitution’s vesting of the power of the purse in Congress \n(Count I).  Second, it is arbitrary and capricious.  The government failed to consider the predictably \ndisastrous consequences of its suspension; the serious reliance interests of USCCB, its partners, \nand refugees; and obvious superior alternatives, like reviewing ongoing programs before halting \nfunding. To top it off, the government provided no remotely adequate explanation for its suspen-\nsion and violated its own regulations (Count II).  Third, the Refugee Funding Suspension consti-\ntutes a substantive rule that was not promulgated through notice and comment (Count III). \nAs a result, USCCB is suffering serious and ongoing irreparable harm.  The massive, un-\nexpected, and continually accruing costs inflicted on USCCB by the Refugee Funding Suspension \nhave forced it to lay off staff with years of accumulated expertise and stop paying the partners on \nwhom it relies to provide refugee services.  The suspension thus inflicts harm to USCCB’s repu-\ntation and goodwill that puts its entire refugee-resettlement program at risk—injuries that com-\npound every day the suspension remains in effect.   \nThe balance of the equities and the public interest also strongly favor injunctive relief.  The \nRefugee Funding Suspension unfairly forces USCCB to assume millions of dollars in costs to care \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-AHA     Document 5     Filed 02/19/25     Page 3 of 5\nfor the nearly 7,000 refugees that the government placed in its care with the promise of federal \nfunding.  It also harms lawfully admitted refugees by threatening their funding for essential ser-\nvices and training that will enable them to become self-sufficient members of American society.  \nAll of this is contrary to the public interest that multiple Congresses and Presidents recognized by \nenacting statutes requiring and funding refugee resettlement assistance.   \nUSCCB respectfully asks this Court to enjoin Defendants and their agents from implement-\ning, enforcing, or otherwise giving effect to any rule, order, policy, or other agency action sus-\npending, freezing, pausing, or otherwise preventing the obligation or disbursement of appropriated \nfunds  to  reimburse  past  and  ongoing  expenses  incurred  by  USCCB  in  connection  with \nSPRMCO24CA0342 and SPRMCO24CA0336 (the “Cooperative Agreements”). \nUSCCB respectfully requests an injunction commanding that Defendants and their agents: \n(cid:120)  shall not implement, enforce, or otherwise give effect to the January 24, 2025 suspension \nletter issued by the State Department to USCCB; \n(cid:120)  shall not issue or reissue any other letters or take any other actions that have a materially \nsimilar effect; \n(cid:120)  shall promptly reimburse all allowable expenses in connection with the Cooperative \nAgreements that USCCB has submitted and may in the future submit for reimbursement.   \nPursuant to Local Civil Rule 65.1(a), and shortly before filing this motion, on February 19, \n2025, counsel for USCCB emailed the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of Federal Programs \nand two Federal Programs attorneys who have appeared in related cases to provide them with \nelectronic copies of the complaint and its exhibits, summons, this motion for a temporary restrain-\ning order and preliminary injunction, the memorandum in support of the motion, the declarations \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-AHA     Document 5     Filed 02/19/25     Page 4 of 5\nof William Canny and Azizullah Areiyaee, the other exhibits attached to this motion, and the pro-\nposed order. \nFebruary 19, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ David W.

Following the conclusion of briefing \non the pending motions, the Conference and the government entered into an agreement to wind \ndown the Conference’s participation in the government’s refugee resettlement program.  A stay \nwould be appropriate while the parties navigate that process before determining what, if any, dis-\nputed issues remain unable to be resolved. \n“[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to con-\ntrol the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for coun-\nsel, and for litigants.”  Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936); accord Ruiz v. Millennium \nSquare Residential Ass’n, 466 F. Supp. 3d 162, 176 (D.D.C. 2020).  In deciding whether to issue \na stay, the court balances its “interests in judicial economy” with “any possible hardship to the \nparties.”  Belize Soc. Dev. Ltd. v. Gov’t of Belize, 668 F.3d 724, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Where there \nis no “fair possibility that the stay . . . will work damage” to any party or “some one else,” judicial \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 58     Filed 07/29/25     Page 2 of 3\neconomy weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay.  Landis, 299 U.S. at 255; see Vallejo Ent. \nLLC v. Small Bus. Admin., 2023 WL 3275634, at *3 (D.D.C. May 5, 2023) (granting stay motion \nwhere “the harm” to the opposing party was at best “unclear while the efficiency gains [were] \nclear, certain, and definite”). \nA stay here would “result[] in resource savings for both the parties and the [C]ourt” without \nany risk of harm.  Phil Waldrep Evangelistic Ass’n v. Small Bus. Admin., 2023 WL 10553640, at \n*1 (D.D.C. Mar. 14, 2023).  Since the motion to dismiss briefing concluded, the Conference and \nthe government have agreed to discontinue the Conference’s participation in the refugee resettle-\nment program, and the parties have made substantial progress in resolving outstanding payments \nowed to the Conference for its work and the work of its partner resettlement agencies.  The ongoing \nnegotiations may obviate the need for further litigation; at the very least they are likely to “settle” \nor “simplify” questions of both fact and law should the case need to proceed.  Landis, 299 U.S. at \n256. \nIn order to give the parties sufficient time to resolve their dispute, and in the service of \npreserving this Court’s and the parties’ “time and effort,” Landis, 299 U.S. at 254, the Conference \nrequests that the Court exercise its discretion to stay all proceedings in this case.  The parties will \nsubmit periodic status reports informing the Court whether the parties are unable to reach an agree-\nment concerning any outstanding requests.  If the parties are unable to resolve any outstanding \nclaims through this wind-down process, the parties will notify the Court and propose further ap-\npropriate steps. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 58     Filed 07/29/25     Page 3 of 3\n \nJuly 29, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ David W.

These contracts \nrequire the Government to fund the Conference’s provision of resettlement services to refugees.   \n  But this Court cannot offer the requested relief.  The Conference’s motion is, at its core, \nseeking a purely contractual remedy.  And the Tucker Act instructs that all contract disputes with \nthe Government must be resolved by the Court of Federal Claims.  More, the Conference’s \ndesired remedy is inconsistent with equitable remedies like injunctions.  The Court thus denies \nthe Conference’s motion.  \nI. \n  For over 60 years, the Government has aided refugees.  This mission started in the thick \nof the Cold War, when Congress appropriated funds to address “urgent refugee and migration \nneeds” in response to individuals fleeing communist countries.  Migration and Refugee \nAssistance Act of 1962, 22 U.S.C. § 2601(c).  Later, Congress would enact the Refugee Act of \n1980, which created a formal framework for the admission and resettlement of refugees.  Pub. L. \nNo. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1522).  This initiative, called the U.S. Refugee \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 2 of 16\nAdmissions Program, created “a permanent and systematic procedure for the admission to this \ncountry of refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and to provide \ncomprehensive and uniform provisions for the effective resettlement and absorption of those \nrefugees who are admitted.”  Pub. L. No. 96-212, § 101(b), 94 Stat. 102. \n  So refugees who have been persecuted or fear persecution abroad can seek legal \nadmission into the United States through this program.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42), 1157(c).  \nBut there is no rubber stamp for admissions.  At the meta-level, the President sets a cap on the \nmaximum number of refugees who can be admitted annually.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1157 (a)(2), \n1157(c)(1), 1181(c).  And on the ground, an extensive vetting process takes place.  Applicants \nare rigorously screened in their home countries for eligibility.  Before they can be admitted to the \nUnited States, they must undergo detailed interviews, medical examinations, and biometric \nassessments, among other checks.  Am. Compl, ECF No. 29, ¶ 30.   \nIf admitted, refugees assimilating to their new homes are then offered aid under various \nprovisions of the Refugee Assistance Program.  Though this enterprise is multifaceted, at issue \nhere is the “[p]rogram of initial resettlement.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b).    \n  This program envisions a public-private partnership between the Department of State and \nnonprofit organizations.1  8 U.S.C. §1522(b)(1)(A).  State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and \nMigration (“PRM”) is “authorized” to enter into annual cooperative agreements with private \nresettlement agencies whose mission it is to aid refugees in their critical first weeks in the United \nStates.  8 U.S.C. §1522(b)(1)(A)(ii); Am. Compl. ¶ 33; see also Decl. A. Zerbinopoulos, ECF \n \n1 Although the statute authorizes the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to carry out the initial resettlement program, the Director’s statutory obligations for initial \nresettlement have been transferred by presidential designation to the Secretary of State under Section 1522(b)(1)(B) \nand delegated to Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.  Mot. TRO, ECF No. 5-2, at 6 n.1; see also HIAS, \nInc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 316 n.2, 319 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021).   \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 3 of 16\nNo. 25-1, at ¶ 11 (explaining that initial resettlement funding is provided to a refugee for 30 to 90 \ndays).  Under the cooperative agreements, PRM awards specific sums to each resettlement \nagency to reimburse the agency for expenses it incurs supporting the refugees during those initial \nweeks.  Am. Compl. ¶ 33; Decl. A. Zerbinopoulos ¶ 9.  This funding covers essential services \nsuch as transportation from the airport, housing, food, and clothing.  Am. Compl. ¶ 33; § \n1522(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(7); Decl. A. Zerbinopoulos ¶ 10.  It also helps get refugees access to \nsocial, medical, educational, and employment services.  Am. Compl. ¶ 33; § 1522(a)(1), \n(b)(1)(A), (b)(7); Decl. A. Zerbinopoulos ¶ 10.  The support given in the first three months is \nessential, as “[l]ost opportunities for English and job training in the earliest days of resettlement \noften can’t be made up for later.”  Decl. W. Canny, ECF No. 5-3, ¶ 22.   \n  The Conference is one of ten resettlement agencies receiving funding under the program.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 33.  For the Conference, helping refugees is no minor avocation.  Its participation \nin the Refugee Admissions Program reflects the Catholic Church’s longstanding commitment to \nmigrants and refugees.  Am. Compl. ¶ 25 (citing Pope Pius XII, Apostolic Constitution, Exsul \nFamilia Nazarethana (1952)).  This commitment honors the Holy Family’s refugee status during \ntheir flight to Egypt.  See Amend. Compl. ¶ 25; Matthew 2:13–16.  In line with this mission, the \nConference has partnered with the federal government for over 40 years to provide initial \nresettlement services to refugees.  Am. Compl. ¶ 40.  And today, the Conference runs the largest \nnon-governmental resettlement program in the country, serving roughly 17% of resettling \nrefugees.  Am. Compl. ¶ 41.  \n  For Fiscal Year 2025, the Conference entered into two cooperative agreements with PRM \nawarding the Conference about $65 million for initial resettlement.  Am. Compl. ¶ 43; \nCooperative Agreement 1, ECF No. 5-4; Cooperative Agreement 2, ECF No. 5-5.  One of these \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 4 of 16\nagreements covers refugees and awards around $43 million in funding, while the other covers \nspecial immigrant visa holders from Afghanistan (i.e., those who assisted the U.S. mission in \nAfghanistan and fear retaliation) and awards around $22 million in funding.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 32, \n43; Cooperative Agreement 1 at 2, 4; Cooperative Agreement 2 at 2, 4.  In all other relevant \nrespects, the cooperation agreements are identical.  Both contracts run from October 1, 2024, to \nSeptember 30, 2025.  Am. Compl. ¶ 43; Cooperative Agreement 1 at 2; Cooperative Agreement \n2 at 2.   \n  At least, they were meant to.  But their continuing viability was cast into doubt beginning \non January 20, 2025.  That afternoon, President Trump signed an executive order titled \n“Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.”  Exec. Order No. 14,169, 90 Fed. \nReg. 8619 (Jan 20, 2025).  The Foreign Aid Order directed relevant executive branch officials to \ninstitute a “90-day pause in United States foreign development assistance” pending review of the \nprograms’ alignment with Administration priorities.  Id. § 3(a).  The same day, the President \nsuspended the entry of most new refugees into the United States.  See Exec. Order No. 14,163, \n90 Fed. Reg. 8459 (Jan. 20, 2025).  \n  Shortly afterward, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued his own directive:  “[c]onsistent \nwith” the Foreign Aid Order, “all new obligations of funding . . . for foreign assistance programs \nfunded by or through the Department and USAID” would be paused “pending a review.”  Mem. \nfrom Sec’y of State to All Diplomatic and Consular Posts, 25 State 6828 (Jan. 24, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/J26T-VCJR (“Rubio Memo”).  Later that day, PRM purported to comply.  It \nsent a suspension letter to the Conference that “immediately suspended” funds under the \nConference’s cooperative agreements “pending a Department-wide review of foreign assistance \nprograms.”  PRM Suspension Letter, ECF No. 29-5.  The suspension letter ordered the \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 5 of 16\nConference to “stop all work under the award(s) and not incur any new costs” after January 24.  \nId.  The suspension letter reasoned that the pause in funding was “[c]onsistent with the \nPresident’s Executive Order” and noted that the award to the Conference “may no longer \neffectuate agency priorities.”  Id.    \n  But the Conference had millions of dollars in requested reimbursements pending with \nState.  Mot. TRO, ECF No. 5-2, at 12.  And more, without ongoing funding, the thousands of \nrefugees already in its care would soon lack support.  Id.  The Conference filed suit and promptly \nsought a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and preliminary injunction.2  Compl., ECF No. 1; \nMot. TRO.  Days later, this Court held an oral hearing on those motions.  Minute Entry, \n2/20/2025.  It denied the request for the TRO, finding that the Conference had failed to meet its \nburden of irreparable harm “for such an exigent, [] extraordinary remedy.”  Tr. Mots. Hearing, \nECF No. 21, at 48:16–17.  But the Court stressed that it was not making any “conclusive ruling” \nas to the request for preliminary injunction.  Id. at 48:18.  The Court thus issued an expedited \nbriefing schedule and set a follow-up hearing for the preliminary injunction a week later.  Id. at \n52–53.            \n  Just days before that hearing, the State Department doubled down.  On February 26, State \nissued two formal notices of termination to the Conference, canceling the cooperative \nagreements between the Conference and PRM.  Am. Compl. ¶ 56; Termination Letters, ECF No. \n27.  The justification behind the termination was simple: the agreements “no longer effectuate[d] \nagency priorities.”  Termination Letters at 4–5.  PRM thus terminated the awards “in accordance \n \n2 Defendants include the Department of State, Secretary Rubio, PRM, and the Assistant Secretary of PRM.  Compl. \nat 1.  The Conference also named the Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy \n(collectively, the “Government”) as defendants “out of an abundance of caution,” because 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a) \nobligates the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Service to \ncarry out certain refugee programs.  Compl. at 12 n.2; Mot. TRO at 6 n.1.   \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 6 of 16\nwith the U.S. Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions, 2 C.F.R. 200.340, and/or \nAward Provisions as applicable.”  Id.  This was based on federal regulations, incorporated into \nthe cooperative agreements, that permit termination “to the greatest extent authorized by law” if \nan award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  See Cooperative \nAgreement 1 at 81; Cooperative Agreement 2 at 84; 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  The Conference \nwas therefore ordered to “stop all work on the program” and refrain from “incur[ring] any new \ncosts,” effective immediately.  Termination Letters at 4–5.  \n  The Court asked for updated briefing to explain the legal salience of a termination as \nopposed to a suspension.  See Minute Entry 2/28/2025.  That briefing has since been submitted.  \nIn its amended motion for a preliminary injunction, the Conference urges that it is still likely to \nsucceed on the merits of its claims.  It argues that the termination is contrary to various federal \nlaws, including the Refugee Act of 1980 and the Impoundment Control Act.  Am. Mot. Prelim. \nInj., ECF No. 30-2, at 4–8.  It also insists that the sudden termination was arbitrary and \ncapricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  Id. at 8–9.  More, the Conference \nstresses that it meets all the other necessary requirements to earn preliminary relief—that it will \nsuffer irreparable injury without Court intervention, and that the public interest favors relief.  Id. \nat 9–10.  So the Conference asks that the Court “enjoin[]” Defendants “from implementing, \nenforcing, or otherwise giving effect to any rule, order, policy, or other agency action \nsuspending, freezing, pausing, or otherwise preventing the obligation or disbursement of \nappropriated funds to provide refugee resettlement services.”  Prop. Order, ECF No. 30-1, at 1.    \n  The Government urges mainly that this Court lacks jurisdiction over this action.  It insists \nthat the Tucker Act directs all contract disputes with the federal government to the Court of \nFederal Claims.  Suppl. Opp’n, ECF No. 35, at 1.  According to the Government, the “sole basis” \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 7 of 16\nfor the Conference’s motion “is grounded in the Cooperative Agreements,” and thus district \ncourts are divested of authority to decide it.  Id.  But even if this Court did have jurisdiction, says \nthe Government, the Conference’s challenge would still be fruitless, as the termination decision \nwas neither contrary to law nor was it arbitrary and capricious.  Id. at 4–10.  Finally, the \nGovernment insists that Conference is neither suffering irreparable harm nor enjoys the favor of \nequities and the public interest.  Id. at 11.   \nII.  \n  A preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that is “never awarded \nas of right.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008) (cleaned up).  The movant faces a \nhigh bar for success, as it must demonstrate four elements “by a clear showing”: (1) that it is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) that it likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \ninjunctive relief; (3) that the balance of equities weighs in favor of granting the relief; and (4) \nthat the public interest favors the injunction.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, \n20 (2008).  Where, as here, the Government is the party opposing injunctive relief, the latter two \nfactors “merge.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).   \nFinally, the burden is on the movant to demonstrate that the Court has the authority to \nissue the emergency relief it seeks.  Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHous. & Urb. Dev., 723 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 2010), aff’d, 639 F.3d 1078 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  \nLike the concept of Article III standing, the party invoking a federal court’s jurisdiction has the \nburden of proving it.  Cf. Env’tl Working Grp. v. U.S. Food and Drug Admin., 301 F. Supp. 3d \n165, 170 (D.D.C. 2018).  Federal courts start from the presumption that they lack such \njurisdiction.   \n   \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 8 of 16\nIII. \n  The Conference is unlikely to prevail on the merits because this Court lacks the authority \nto grant the relief it seeks.  The requested injunctive relief is incompatible with the Government’s \nsovereign immunity.   \n  Start with the basics.  A plaintiff requesting emergency relief against the Government \n“must identify an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.”  Franklin-Mason v. Mabus, 742 \nF.3d 1051, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  The Conference points to § 702 of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) as providing that waiver.  Am. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 1–2.  But § 702’s \nwaiver comes with a catch—it “does not apply if any other statute that grants consent to suit \nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  Perry Cap. LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d \n591, 618 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).3   \n  The Government argues that the Tucker Act “impliedly forbids” the APA’s sovereign \nimmunity waiver.  Suppl. Opp’n at 1–4.  The Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims \nexclusive jurisdiction over certain suits against the Government, including those “founded . . . \nupon” any “contract with the United States.”4  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1); see also Transohio Sav. \nBank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“[T]his Court and \nothers have interpreted the Tucker Act as providing the exclusive remedy for contract claims \nagainst the government.”).  Thus, if the present motion is grounded in contract, the APA does not \n \n3 The APA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign immunity claims for money damages, 5 U.S.C. § 702, and \nclaims for which an adequate remedy is available elsewhere, 5 U.S.C. § 704.  Because the Court concludes that the \nTucker Act impliedly precludes the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, it need not decide whether these other \nexclusions apply.  \n \n4 The amount in controversy must also be at least $10,000 for Tucker Act jurisdiction.  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. \nGen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  That requirement is easily met, as the Conference alleges \nit has “millions of dollars in pending, unpaid reimbursements.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 7. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 9 of 16\nwaive the Government’s immunity from suit, and the district court cannot afford the requested \nrelief.   \n  But determining whether a dispute is “at its essence” contractual is not always simple.  \nMegapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at \n609 (“The issue is more complicated than the agencies let on.”).  On the one hand, a mere cameo \nby a contract in a suit that is otherwise based on federal law is not enough to kick the case to \nClaims Court.  See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 (“[T]he mere fact that a court may have to rule \non a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically \ntransform an action . . . into one [based] on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it \nmight otherwise have.”).  Even if a dispute implicates a contract, it may be heard in district court \nif it still “stem[s] from a statute or the Constitution.”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.  On the other \nhand, courts are to be wary of plaintiffs artfully pleading their way around the jurisdictional \nstrictures of the Tucker Act.  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, \n1107 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (“[W]e have cautioned plaintiffs that this court prohibits the creative \ndrafting of complaints . . . to avoid the jurisdictional consequences of the Tucker Act.”) (cleaned \nup).   \nResolving the ultimate inquiry of whether a claim is “essentially a contract action” turns \non two key considerations:  “The source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims” \nand “the type of relief sought.”  Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Rsrv. Emp. Benefits \nSys., 357 F.3d 62, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968).   \n   The latter factor is dispositive here.  The nature of relief the Conference seeks “sounds in \ncontract.”  Id. at 68.  It asks the Court to “enjoin[]” the Government  \n“from implementing, enforcing, or otherwise giving effect to any rule . . . \npreventing the obligation or disbursement of appropriated funds to \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 10 of 16\nprovide refugee resettlement services, including by . . . implementing, \nenforcing, or otherwise giving effect to the February 26, 2025, \ntermination letter issued by the State Department to USCCB; or issuing \nor reissuing any other letters or taking any other actions that have a \nmaterially similar effect.”   \n \nProp. Order at 1.   \nStripped of its equitable flair, the requested relief seeks one thing:  The Conference wants \nthe Court to order the Government to stop withholding the money due under the Cooperative \nAgreements.  In even plainer English:  The Conference wants the Government to keep paying \nup.  Thus the Conference “seeks the classic contractual remedy of specific performance.”  \nSpectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  But this Court \ncannot order the Government to pay money due on a contract.  Id.  Such a request for an order \nthat the government “must perform” on its contract is one that “must be resolved by the Claims \nCourt.”  Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 80 (D.C. Cir. 1985); see also Bowen \nv. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 921 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“It is settled that sovereign \nimmunity bars a suit against the United States for specific performance of a contract.”).   \n  Indeed, the Supreme Court has stressed that “an injunction to compel the payment of \nmoney past due under a contract . . . was not typically available in equity”—meaning an \ninjunction is the wrong vehicle to recoup withheld funds.  Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. \nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204, 210–11 (2002).  The more appropriate remedy “for an agency’s \nrecalcitrant failure to pay out may be to ‘seek specific sums already calculated’ and ‘past due’ in \nthe Court of Federal Claims.”  Dept. of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 604 U.S. ---, 2025 \nWL 698083, at *3 (2025) (mem.) (Alito J., dissenting) (quoting Maine Cmty. Health Options v. \nUnited States, 590 U.S. 296, 327 (2020)).  The awkward fit between the relief requested and the \nmedium employed here only underscores the inescapable truth:  The Conference seeks an award \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 11 of 16\nof money due, which a court sitting in equity may not grant.  See Knudson, 534 U.S. at 210 n.1 \n(“[A]ny claim for legal relief can, with lawyerly inventiveness, be phrased in terms of an \ninjunction.”).  \n  The Court is guided by the D.C. Circuit’s opinions in Spectrum and Ingersoll-Rand.  In \nSpectrum, the plaintiff was a party to a contract with the General Services Administration \n(“GSA”).  Spectrum Leasing Corp., 764 F.2d at 892.  There, as here, the plaintiff sued in the \ndistrict court after the GSA stopped paying the plaintiff’s invoices, allegedly in violation of the \nDebt Collection Act.  Id.  The plaintiff sought “an injunction compelling the GSA to cease \nwithholding . . . payments due under the contract.”  Id.  The district court dismissed the case for \nwant of subject matter jurisdiction, and the Circuit affirmed.  Id. at 895.  In affirming, the court \nstressed that plaintiff, at bottom, was pursuing a “typical contract remedy,” as it was merely \ntrying to get what it was promised under the agreement.  Id. at 895.  Thus the case fell within the \nClaims Court’s exclusive jurisdiction.  Id.   \nSimilarly, in Ingersoll-Rand, the plaintiff alleged that the Air Force’s decision to \nterminate its contract for convenience reasons was arbitrary and capricious.  780 F.2d at 75.  The \ncourt found jurisdiction could not lie in the district court because the suit was inherently \ncontractual.  Id. at 80.  As here, the plaintiff in Ingersoll-Rand sought a declaration that the \ncontract termination was unlawful and an injunction requiring the Air Force to undo its \ntermination of the contract.  Id. at 79–80.  The court acknowledged that the complaint nominally \nsought “only a declaratory and injunctive order.”  Id. at 79.  Still, such semantics were \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 12 of 16\ninsufficient to establish district court jurisdiction because “the essence” of the claim was “a \nrequest for specific performance of the original contract.” 5  Id. at 79–80. \n  The Court squints in vain to see any daylight.  Like those plaintiffs, the Conference asks \nthe Court to order the Government to cancel the termination, pay money due, and reinstate the \ncontracts.  That is something this Court lacks the power to do.  \n  Crowley does not counsel otherwise.  There, a plaintiff with a military contract \nchallenged the GSA’s authority to audit and unilaterally reduce future payments under the \ncontract.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1103 & n.4.  Though GSA’s independent audits and payment \noffsets affected the plaintiff’s ability to get paid under the contract, the relief sought was not \ncontractual.  See id. at 1111–12, 1113.  Critically, the plaintiff had no contractual relationship \nwith GSA itself, so any remedy afforded against GSA could neither be construed as damages nor \nspecific performance.  Id. at 1110.  So rather than seeking monetary relief under a contract, the \nplaintiff sought “prospective relief from the GSA’s audits.”  Id. at 1112.  Thus Crowley stands in \ncontradistinction to the present case, where the Conference asks the Court to order the \nGovernment to honor its contractual obligations.  Cf. id. at 1108 (“As all agree, the GSA owes no \n \n5 To be sure, Knudson and Justice Alito’s dissent in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition suggest that payment for \nmoney past due under a government contract cannot be classified as an equitable remedy for specific performance, \npotentially calling some of the reasoning in Spectrum into doubt.  See Knudson, 534 U.S. at 210–12; AIDS Vaccine \nAdvocacy Coal., 2025 WL 698083, at *2-3 (Alito J., dissenting).  But these cases do not undermine the Court’s \nbottom line.  To start, the Conference does not merely seek repayment of contractual sums past due.  It also seeks a \npreliminary injunction reinstating an ongoing financial relationship between itself and the Government, as thousands \nof refugees remain in the initial resettlement period in the Conference’s care.  In other words, the Conference not \nonly wants to be reimbursed for costs sustained, as in Spectrum, but wants an order compelling the Government to \nreimburse the Conference for costs sustained in the future, as in Ingersoll-Rand.  Knudson and Justice Alito’s dissent \nin AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition only speak to costs previously due.  Thus Ingersoll-Rand remains on all-fours \nwith this case.  More, Knudson and Justice Alito’s dissent also suggest that a district court would lack jurisdiction to \nissue an order compelling payment of sums past due, but they paint this rule as grounded in the APA’s exclusion \nfrom its waiver of sovereign immunity suits seeking monetary damages.  So even if these opinions endorse a change \nto the framework for money previously due, this Court still cannot offer the relief requested.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 13 of 16\nduty to Crowley under the Contract . . . .  And Crowley did not seek in district court an order \ncompelling the GSA to perform or fulfill any obligations to Crowley created by the contract.”).    \n  Indeed, another court in this district recently rejected a similar request from plaintiffs \nseeking to revive terminated government contracts.  See AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., et al. v. \nDept. of State, et al., No. 25-cv-00400, 2025 WL 752378, at *23 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025).  In \nAIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, a group of plaintiffs challenged the Executive’s withholding \nof appropriated foreign aid funding and subsequent termination of their contracts.  See id. at *6–\n7, *23.  Just like the Conference, those plaintiffs asked for a preliminary injunction that would, in \neffect, order the Government “to continue to contract with them.”  Id. at *23.  But the court \nrecognized that while the Executive has an obligation to spend appropriated funds, “laws have \ntraditionally afforded the Executive discretion on how to spend” that money.  Id. (emphasis \nadded).  As a result, the court could not order the Government to revive specific contracts.  Id.  \nSo too here.  The relief the Conference seeks in its preliminary injunction—reinstatement of \ncontracts terminated by the Government—is beyond the power of this Court. \n  The Conference resists this conclusion.  But in its artful efforts to dodge the inevitable, \nthe Conference falls prey to precisely the sort of “creative drafting” that Crowley warns against.   \n38 F.4th at 1107.  It insists that it merely seeks the “classic equitable remedies available in an \nadministrative law action”—an order “holding unlawful and setting aside agency action.”  Am. \nMot. Prelim. Inj. at 3 (cleaned up).  In other words, the Conference frames its motion as pursuing \ntypical equitable relief under the APA.  But accepting such an argument would be to distort the \nobvious.  Sure, the Conference seeks to set aside agency action.  But the agency action that it \nasks the Court to reverse is the Government’s decision to cease a financial relationship with the \nConference.  This is not standard injunctive fare.  Cf. Knudson, 534 U.S. at 211 (“[A]n injunction \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 14 of 16\nto compel the payment of money past due under a contract . . . was not typically available in \nequity.”); see also Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1524 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, J.) (“We \nknow of no case in which a court has asserted jurisdiction . . . to issue an injunction compelling \nthe United States to fulfill its contractual obligations.”).  Instead, it is a request that the Court \norder the Government “to pay money owed . . . under an executory contract.”  Spectrum, 764 \nF.2d at 894; see also Am. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 4 (describing “the relief most important to [the \nConference]” as “specific performance” in addition to “prospective relief.”).  This request is \n“founded upon a contract for purposes of the Tucker Act.”  Spectrum, 764 F.2d at 895.  It thus \nmust be heard in Claims Court.6  \n*     *     *  \n   In short, the Conference alleges that, over the last several weeks, the Government paused \nand then reneged on its contracts.  At issue here is not whether the Government had the right to \ndo so, much less whether the Government was right to do so.  No, the question is far narrower:  \nWhether this Court has the authority to afford the “drastic” emergency relief that the Conference \nseeks.  F.T.C. v. Exxon Corp., 636 F.2d 1336, 1343 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  It does not.   \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court makes no finding on its jurisdiction over the \nunderlying Complaint.  There is no motion to dismiss presently before the Court that would call \n \n6 The D.C. Circuit has suggested that the Claims Court can offer this type of relief.  See Spectrum, 764 F.2d at 895 \nn.7 (“The Claims Court . . . ordinarily lacks the authority to grant specific performance of contracts as well as other \nforms of equitable relief.  We note, however, that in limited circumstances the Claims Court when exercising Tucker \nAct jurisdiction may be empowered to grant such equitable relief where the relief sought is in the form of money.”);  \nbut see Bowen, 487 U.S. at 920–21 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (noting that the Claims Court lacks authority to grant \nspecific performance).  Regardless of the precise remedial powers of the Claims Court, the Circuit signaled that \ngovernment contractors seeking specific performance must go there, even if the contractor will be limited to a \ndamages remedy.  Ingersoll-Rand Co., 780 F.2d at 80 (noting that the plaintiff “would prefer to avoid becoming \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Claims Court because there its remedies could not include specific performance,” \nbut stressing that the plaintiff could not “avoid[] this remedy restriction” and must have its complaint “resolved by \nthe Claims Court.”).  After all, Congress designed the APA so that it would “not change existing limitations on \nspecific relief . . . derived from statutes dealing with such matters as government contracts.”  H.R. Rep. 94-1656, at \n13 (1976), as reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6121, 6133. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 15 of 16\nfor an assessment of jurisdiction writ large.  Instead, the Court holds simply that it “cannot find \nthat [the Conference] [is] likely to succeed on the merits” of its motion because the court “has no \nauthority to remedy [the alleged violations] in the way plaintiff[] ask[s].”  Greater New Orleans \nFair Hous. Action Ctr., 723 F. Supp. 2d at 10.  This conclusion may not flow to the Complaint \nitself.  The nature of relief sought in the Complaint is notably different than that sought in the \npresent motion, and those distinctions may well matter for jurisdictional purposes.  Compare \nAmend. Compl. 40–41 with Prop. Order at 1; see also Sharp, 798 F.2d at 1523 (dividing up \nclaims and prayer for relief to determine jurisdiction over each).  At any rate, whether the \nComplaint requests relief that sounds not in contract but in the proper jurisdiction of a district \ncourt, this decision leaves for another day.   \nThis Court wields “only that power authorized by Constitution and statute . . . which is \nnot to be expanded by judicial decree.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. \n375, 377 (1994).  “[T]o allow suit against the United States under the APA in actions actually \nbased on contract would create such inroads into the restrictions of the Tucker Act that it would \nultimately result in the demise of the Court of Claims”—and, accordingly, an abrogation of \ncongressional prerogative and will.  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967.  This Court is but a creature of \nthe trifurcated structure of its Constitution.  It is perhaps when emotions are at their zenith that \nthe imperative to police jurisdictional bounds carries the most importance.  \n   \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 37     Filed 03/11/25     Page 16 of 16\nIV. \n  In sum, the Conference cannot succeed on the merits of its claims because the Court lacks \njurisdiction over the relief the Conference seeks in its preliminary injunction.  Its motion for a \npreliminary injunction is thus DENIED.  \n  SO ORDERED.  \n  \n           \nDated: March 11, 2025        TREVOR N. McFADDEN, U.S.D.J. \n16 ",

For decades, the Department has partnered with \nthe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (“USCCB”) to carry out this pro-\ngram. \nBut on January 24, 2025, the government unlawfully suspended the \nrefugee-resettlement program.  And on February 26, after litigation com-\nmenced, the government terminated USCCB’s agreements altogether.  It \ndid not merely halt support for future refugees; it stopped resettlement \nassistance for the thousands of already-arrived refugees it had assigned \nto resettlement partners, including USCCB.  That violated the Refugee \nAct, the Impoundment Control Act, the APA, and federal regulations.   \nThis Court should issue an injunction pending appeal requiring the \ngovernment  to  fulfill  its  statutory  and  regulatory  obligations  under \n8 U.S.C. § 1522 to provide resettlement assistance to refugees already \npresent in the United States. \nThe district court denied USCCB’s motion for preliminary injunc-\ntion, mischaracterizing USCCB’s requested relief as “purely contractual” \n1 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 8 of 37\n \nand concluding it lacked jurisdiction.  It denied USCCB’s motion for in-\njunction pending appeal on the same ground.   \nBecause USCCB’s claims are meritorious and not barred by the \nTucker Act, and because USCCB faces grave irreparable harm, USCCB \nmoves this Court for an emergency injunction pending appeal and for ex-\npedited consideration of the appeal.  The parties agree to expedited brief-\ning of this motion:  \n  March 21: Opposition to motion \n  March 25: Reply in support of motion \nUSCCB respectfully requests that this Court decide its emergency \nmotion for injunction pending appeal before March 28, 2025 (when addi-\ntional layoffs take effect). \nBACKGROUND \nThe  Catholic  Church  has  cared  for  refugees  since  its  inception.  \nApp.46-47.  Since 1980, USCCB has carried out the Church’s mission to \ncare for refugees in partnership with the federal government.  App.46. \nCongress has declared it the “historic policy of the United States to \nrespond to the urgent needs” of refugees.  Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. \nNo. 96-212, § 101, 94 Stat. 102.  In the Refugee Act of 1980, Congress \n2 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 9 of 37\n \ncreated a statutory framework for both refugee admissions and the pro-\nvision of “transitional assistance” to integrate refugees effectively.  Id.  \nRefugees are first rigorously vetted and enter the country legally.  Refu-\ngee  Processing  and  Security  Screening,  USCIS,  https://perma.cc/\n4A8CEQRZ.  Once here, they become eligible for “domestic resettlement \nassistance,” and Congress has consistently appropriated funds for that \npurpose.  8 U.S.C. § 1522; e.g., Department of State, Foreign Operations, \nand Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 \nStat. 460, 744 (2024) (appropriating $3.928 billion to the State Depart-\nment for, among other things, “activities to meet refugee and migration \nneeds”). \nThe Refugee Act provides that the government “shall, to the extent \nof available appropriations,” “make available sufficient resources” for em-\nployment and English language training and cash assistance, to enable \nrefugees to “become effectively resettled” and “economic[ally] self-suffi-\ncien[t]” as “quickly as possible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).  The government pro-\nvides this assistance through various resettlement programs.  Under the \ninitial-resettlement program, the State Department enters annual agree-\nments with nonprofits like USCCB to provide essential assistance—like \n3 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 10 of 37\n \nhousing, food, and clothing, as well as social, medical, educational, and \nemployment  services—during  refugees’  first  90  days  in  the  United \nStates.  Id. § 1522(b); App.43. \nUnder USCCB’s cooperative agreements for 2025, the government \ncommitted $65 million for initial resettlement.  App.38.  In coordination \nwith local Catholic Charities, USCCB uses these funds to care for thou-\nsands of refugees in the United States.  App.37. \nOn January 24, 2025, without notice, the State Department sus-\npended funding for refugee resettlement nationwide by issuing suspen-\nsion letters to its resettlement partners.  It claimed that the suspension \nwas “[c]onsistent with” President Trump’s Executive Order “Reevaluat-\ning and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” and that the agreements \n“may no longer effectuate agency priorities.”  App.25.  Since the suspen-\nsion, and despite ongoing conversations with USCCB, see App.27-33, the \ngovernment has not made any payments to USCCB—even to reimburse \npre-January 24 services, which the suspension letter purported to allow.  \nApp.40.  USCCB filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of \nColumbia on February 18, 2025, and requested a temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction.  Dkt. 1. \n4 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 11 of 37\n \nOn February 26, 2025, two days before the preliminary injunction \nhearing, the State Department doubled down:  USCCB received two one-\npage letters purporting to terminate the initial-resettlement program.  \nApp.75-80.  They stated that the awards “no longer effectuate agency pri-\norities”—without explaining the Department’s priorities, why the awards \nno longer effectuate them, or why USCCB must immediately “stop all \nwork” and abandon the thousands of refugees still in their critical 90-day \nperiod.  Id.   \nThe district court denied USCCB’s motion for a preliminary injunc-\ntion,  concluding  that  the  court  lacked  jurisdiction  because  the  relief \nUSCCB sought was “incompatible with the Government’s sovereign im-\nmunity.”  Dkt. 37 at 8 (“Op.”).  The court later denied USCCB’s motion \nfor injunction pending appeal on the same ground.  App.82. \nThe consequences have been devastating for USCCB and its refu-\ngees.  At the time of the suspension, there were more than 6,700 refugees \nassigned  to  USCCB  who  were  within  their  90-day  transition  period.  \nApp.40.  As of February 24, 2025, more than 5,000 eligible refugees re-\nmained.  App.64.  USCCB is short millions of dollars in unpaid reim-\nbursements for services already rendered and is accruing millions more \n5 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 12 of 37\n \neach week—with no indication the government will fund any additional \nservices.  App.62-63.  USCCB has already been forced to initiate layoffs \nfor fifty employees.  App.62.  It faces irreparable damage to its refugee \nresettlement programs, its relationships with its partners, and its mis-\nsion.  App.42-43.  USCCB’s inability to reimburse its partners has re-\nquired them to lay off staff and stop providing critical services to refu-\ngees.  See App.49-58, 65-69.  Refugees who have already entered the \nUnited States have been or may soon be cut off from support, id., making \nit more difficult for refugees to establish themselves as productive mem-\nbers of society.  Absent an injunction pending appeal, these harms are \ncertain to continue.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis Court reviews de novo “any legal conclusions upon which the \ndistrict court relies” in granting or denying a preliminary injunction.  \nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. \nCir. 2006).   \n6 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 13 of 37\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction To Grant Preliminary Relief \nUSCCB seeks an order preliminarily enjoining the government to \ncomply with its statutory obligations under 8 U.S.C. § 1522 and to cease \nits unlawful abandonment of the refugee resettlement assistance pro-\ngram.  USCCB’s claims and relief sought fall squarely within the prov-\nince of this Court and the district court, both under the APA and federal \ncourts’ equitable power to enjoin “violations of federal law by federal of-\nficials.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 \n(2015); 5 U.S.C. §§ 703, 705, 706.   \nThe district court erred in concluding the “requested injunctive re-\nlief is incompatible with the Government’s sovereign immunity.”  Op. 8.  \nThe APA waives immunity for suits seeking “relief other than money \ndamages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  In Bowen v. Massachusetts, the Supreme \nCourt held that “an equitable action for specific relief” is not an action for \n“money damages,” and therefore is within the APA’s waiver even if the \n“judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another.”  487 \n7 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 14 of 37\n \nU.S. 879, 893 (1988).  Thus, a suit “seeking to enforce [a] statutory man-\ndate” is a permissible equitable action “within the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity in section 702.”  Id. at 900.  \nA.   The district court incorrectly concluded that the Tucker Act \n“impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  Op. 8 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 702).  Exclusive Tucker Act jurisdiction “depends not simply on whether \na case involves contract issues, but on whether, despite the presence of a \ncontract, plaintiffs’ claims are founded only on a contract, or whether they \nstem from a statute or the Constitution.”  Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., \nOff. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (emphasis \nadded).   \nThis  Court  therefore  looks  to  three  considerations—claim  by \nclaim—to determine if the Tucker Act bars a claim.  A claim falls “within \nthe Claims Court’s exclusive Tucker Act jurisdiction” only if “both” (1) the \n“source” of the right asserted is contractual, “and” (2) the relief sought is \ncontractual.  Crowley Gov. Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th \n1099, 1106-07 & n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (emphases added); see also Mega-\npulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  And this Court \n(3) has “categorically reject[ed] the suggestion that a federal district court \n8 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 15 of 37\n \ncan be deprived of jurisdiction by the Tucker Act when no jurisdiction lies \nin the Court of Federal Claims.”  Tootle v. Sec’y of the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, \n176 (D.C. Cir. 2006).1   \nThe district court erred at the outset by addressing only the relief \nsought; it did not address the nature of the claim or definitively conclude \nthat the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction to grant the requested \nrelief.  The court erred on that basis alone.  In any event, all three con-\nsiderations demonstrate that USCCB’s claims are cognizable in district \ncourt. \nFirst, USCCB’s claims are grounded in statutory and regulatory du-\nties—not contracts.  USCCB’s core claim is that the government has a \nstatutory obligation to provide refugee resettlement assistance because \nthe Refugee Act demands that it “shall, to the extent of available appro-\npriations” provide such services.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).  USCCB also argues \n \n1 As this Court has also recognized, there is a “strong case that, after \nBowen, the Tucker Act should not be read to ‘impliedly forbid’ under the \nAPA the bringing in district court of contract actions for specific relief.”  \nTransohio, 967 F.2d at 612.  That is because Bowen noted “the nonexclu-\nsivity of Claims Court jurisdiction,” and “[n]othing in the language of ei-\nther the Tucker Act or the APA requires special treatment for contract \nclaims.”  Id.  Regardless, under this Court’s precedent, the Conference’s \nclaims belong here. \n \n9 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 16 of 37\n \nthe government has violated other statutory and regulatory obligations \nincluding the Impoundment Control Act, the APA, and the Uniform Ad-\nministrative Requirements.  See infra § II.  Determining whether the \ngovernment “exceeded its authority” or “violated” these laws “requires \nprimarily an examination of the statutes” and regulations it “has pur-\nportedly violated”; these are “not questions the district court can answer \nby examining a contractual promise.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1108-09.   \nUSCCB’s claims thus resemble those that this Court has repeatedly \nheld cognizable in district court.  See, e.g., Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d \n1521, 1524 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“federal regulations, statutes and the Con-\nstitution”); Transohio, 967 F.2d at 611 (similar); Crowley, 38 F.4th at \n1108 (statutes).  USCCB’s claims do not depend on breaches of its agree-\nments.  Contra Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits, 357 F.3d 62, 66-69 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (asserting breach of “section 7.1,” “section 10.2,” and “sec-\ntion 8.1(b) of the Board Plan”). \nSecond, USCCB seeks classic remedies available in an APA action: \nan order (1) preliminarily enjoining agency action that violates statutes \nand is arbitrary and capricious, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 703, 705, 706(2); Ohio v. \n10 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 17 of 37\n \nEPA, 603 U.S. 279, 300 (2024) (staying enforcement of rule pending ap-\npeal); and (2) compelling agency action required “by law,” Norton v. S. \nUtah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 65 (2004); see 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  \nIn particular, USCCB seeks a preliminary injunction requiring the \ngovernment to comply with Section 1522 and enjoining enforcement of \nthe government’s across-the-board discontinuation of the refugee reset-\ntlement assistance program.  While the government likely would comply \nwith such an injunction by adhering to USCCB’s cooperative agreements, \nit could choose to provide the required assistance without reinstating the \nagreements.  And even if the proper remedy is specific performance, that \nwould not strip this Court of jurisdiction, because “a federal district court \nmay accept jurisdiction over a statutory or constitutional claim for in-\njunctive relief even where the relief sought is an order forcing the gov-\nernment to obey the terms of a contract.”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610. \nUSCCB’s requested order also would confer “non-monetary relief” \nwith “‘considerable value’ independent of any future potential for mone-\ntary relief,” Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army, 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. 1995), \nby allowing USCCB to fulfill its promise to the refugees placed in its care \nand carry out its mission to assist refugees, see App.47-48.  Thus, the \n11 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 18 of 37\n \nrelief sought would extend a “host of non-monetary benefits” including \n“the ability to provide services to [refugees] and perform its contractual \nobligations free of … alleged interference.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1111.  \nAny monetary consequences “will not come from the District Court’s ex-\nercise of jurisdiction, ‘but from the structure of statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.’”  Tootle, 446 F.3d at 175.   \nThird, this case is cognizable in district court because the Court of \nFederal Claims cannot provide the relief most important for USCCB:  \n“prospective relief.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 905.  The Federal Circuit has \nagreed that a complaint that “unmistakably asks for prospective relief”—\nincluding “payments to which [the plaintiff] is entitled pursuant to fed-\neral statute and regulations”—and turns on “the interpretation of law \nwhich controls payment” is properly in the district court’s jurisdiction.  \nKatz v. Cisneros, 16 F.3d 1204, 1208, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  Only prompt \nequitable relief, not future money damages, can redress the ongoing ir-\nreparable harm to USCCB’s mission as it is prevented from assisting the \nrefugees in its care.  Bowen rejected the suggestion that a claim “for dam-\nages … in the Claims Court” is an “‘adequate substitute for prospective \nrelief.’”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 608. \n12 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 19 of 37\n \nB.  The district court’s contrary reasoning is unpersuasive.  To \nbegin, it quoted the Bowen dissent’s statement that “sovereign immunity \nbars a suit against the United States for specific performance of a con-\ntract.”  487 U.S. at 921 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  USCCB is not seeking \nspecific performance of a contract.  Regardless, the Bowen majority ex-\nplained that “specific performance of [a] contract” is not a request for \n“money damages” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 702, so it is within \nthe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity.  487 U.S. at 895 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Bowen further recognized that “the policies of the APA \ntake precedence over the Tucker Act” because “it seems highly unlikely \nthat Congress intended to designate an Article I court as the primary \nforum for judicial review of agency action that may involve questions of \npolicy.”  Id. at 895, 908 n.46 (quotation marks omitted).  Bowen’s dissent, \nby contrast, relied on Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 \nU.S. 682 (1949).  That case tells us nothing about whether Section 702’s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for non-money-damages suits encompasses \nclaims  for  specific  performance  because  it  pre-dated  the  1976  APA \namendment that added that waiver.  See Bowen, 487 U.S. at 891-93 (ma-\njority op.).   \n13 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 20 of 37\n \nConsistent with Bowen, this Court has held that a district court \nmay grant an “order forcing the government to obey the terms of a con-\ntract” where, as here, the plaintiff brings a “statutory or constitutional \nclaim.”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610.  The district court disregarded these \nbinding precedents. \nThe district court also cited Justice Alito’s dissent in Department of \nState v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, 604 U.S. ---, 2025 WL 698083 \n(Mar. 5, 2025), which relied on Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. \nv. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204 (2002).  Knudson held that specific performance \nwas unavailable between private parties under a statute that authorized \n“equitable relief.”  534 U.S. at 209-10.  But equity has long recognized a \ncause of action to enjoin federal officials’ violations of federal law, see \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 327, and equity courts would grant specific per-\nformance “to prevent future losses that … were incalculable,” Knudson, \n534 U.S. at 211.  USCCB’s suit fits within both of those categories. \nEqually misplaced was the district court’s reliance on Spectrum \nLeasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and Inger-\nsoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  In Spectrum, \nthe Debt Collection Act “in no way create[d] the substantive right” the \n14 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 21 of 37\n \nplaintiff invoked; it had no legal effect separate from the pre-existing con-\ntract.  764 F.2d at 894 (emphasis added).  Here, by contrast, the govern-\nment’s statutory duties under the Refugee Act, Impoundment Control \nAct, and APA exist independently of its agreements with USCCB; they \nare non-contractual bases for USCCB’s claims.   \nUSCCB’s case more closely resembles one that Spectrum accepted \nand distinguished:  National Helium Corp. v. Morton, 455 F.2d 650 (10th \nCir. 1971).  In that case, as Spectrum explained, the Tenth Circuit or-\ndered an agency “to comply with … the National Environmental Policy \nAct” before “cancelling a helium conservation contract”—resulting in the \n“reinstatement of the helium contract” and “obligat[ing] the government \nto perform under it.”  Spectrum, 764 F.2d at 894 n.4.  Like the Morton \nplaintiff, USCCB is “not asserting a private right in [its] capacity as gov-\nernment contractor[], but [is] instead … enforcing” statutes.  Id.  \nIn Ingersoll-Rand, three considerations favored treating the claim’s \nsource as contractual, none of which apply here.  First, it is not “possible \nto conceive of this dispute as entirely contained within the terms of the \ncontract,” 780 F.2d at 78, because the statutory violations USCCB alleges \ncannot be reframed as violations of any clause of its agreements.  Second, \n15 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 22 of 37\n \nthe “issues raised by [USCCB’s] complaint are” not “within the unique \nexpertise of the Court of Claims”—which has no special expertise in in-\nterpreting these statutes.  Id.  Third, USCCB has no need to analogize to \na bid protest action because its claims are based on statutes and regula-\ntions.  Id. \nRather than relying on dissents and inapposite pre-Bowen case law, \nthe district court should have applied (but instead ignored) this Court’s \nmany cases concluding that jurisdiction was proper notwithstanding the \nconnection of the plaintiff’s claims to a contract or the fact that the re-\nquested relief may resemble specific performance.  See, e.g., Perry Capital \nLLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (no exclusive juris-\ndiction even though fiduciary duties “arose from” contractual relation-\nship); Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971 (same, even if “injunction would re-\nquire ... specific (non)performance” of “a contract”); Kidwell, 56 F.3d at \n284 (same, even if “success … may obligate the United States to pay the \ncomplainant”); Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1108-09; Tootle, 446 F.3d at 176; \nTransohio, 967 F.2d at 610. \n16 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 23 of 37\n \nII.  USCCB Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nA.  The Government’s Funding Cessation Violates the \nRefugee Act of 1980 \n1.  The Refugee Act aimed “to provide comprehensive and uni-\nform provisions for the effective resettlement and absorption of those ref-\nugees who are admitted.”  § 101(b), 94 Stat. at 102.  To accomplish that \nobjective, Congress required the government to provide resettlement ser-\nvices to admitted refugees.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).  Congress mandated \nthat the government “shall” provide funding “to the extent of available \nappropriations” for services like employment and English training such \nthat  refugees  become  self-sufficient  “as  quickly  as  possible.”    Id. \n§ 1522(a)(1)(A).  Congress also directed that the government “shall de-\nvelop and implement … policies and strategies for the placement and re-\nsettlement of refugees within the United States,” id. § 1522(a)(2)(B), and \nexpressed its “intent” that “employable refugees should be placed on jobs \nas soon as possible after their arrival,” id. § 1522(a)(1)(B)(i).   \nAlthough Congress made refugee-resettlement assistance manda-\ntory, it gave the government discretion over how to provide it.  For the \nprogram at issue here—the “program of initial resettlement”—the gov-\n17 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 24 of 37\n \nernment can provide services through resettlement non-profits, as it al-\nways has.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b)(1).  Or the government may implement the \nprogram itself.  Id. § 1522(b)(2).  But Congress left it no discretion to \nwithhold available appropriations for the initial resettlement of admitted \nrefugees.  See In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \nYet that is exactly what the government has done through the sus-\npension and the termination.  It has ceased providing USCCB funding \nfor the thousands of refugees in USCCB’s care still within their initial-\nresettlement periods.  And it has offered no evidence that it is providing \nthat funding directly to refugees.  That funding cessation violates the \nRefugee Act. \n2.  The government has argued that the Refugee Act makes ini-\ntial-resettlement funding entirely optional.  Dkt. 35, at 4-5.  That is in-\ncorrect.  Its principal argument has been that Section 1522(b) merely “au-\nthorizes” it to provide initial-resettlement assistance through public-pri-\nvate partnerships.  Id. at 6.  But that discretion is limited to deciding how \nto provide initial-resettlement assistance—either through private agen-\ncies or directly.  The Refugee Act does not grant discretion over whether \nto provide assistance at all.   \n18 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 25 of 37\n \nRather, Section 1522(a)’s funding obligations apply throughout Sec-\ntion 1522.  Section 1522(a)’s first sentence provides that “under this sec-\ntion”—which includes Section 1522(b)—the government “shall” fund the \nspecified  resettlement  services  “to  the  extent  of  available  appropria-\ntions.”  Id. § 1522(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  Section 1522(b) further in-\nstructs that “[g]rants to, or contracts with, private nonprofit voluntary \nagencies under this paragraph shall be made consistent with the objec-\ntives of this subchapter”—which includes Section 1522(a)’s commands.  \nId.  § 1522(b)(1)(A)  (emphasis  added).    Section 1522(a)’s  requirements \nthus flow down to the initial-resettlement program.   \nContextual  cues  point  to  the  same  conclusion.    When  Congress \nwanted to carve out activities under subsection (b) from Section 1522(a)’s \nrequirements, it did so expressly.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(4)(B).  The gov-\nernment’s position also would mean that in implementing the initial-re-\nsettlement  program  (but  not  Section  1522’s  other  resettlement  pro-\ngrams), the government would be relieved of all of Section 1522(a)’s obli-\ngations, including requirements for where a refugee is “initially placed or \nresettled.”  Id. § 1522(a)(2)(C).  Moreover, it would be passing strange if \nCongress wanted to give the government unfettered discretion to decide \n19 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 26 of 37\n \nwhether to fund resettlement payment obligations only during a refugee’s \ncrucial first 90 days in America.   \nThe government also has argued that Section 1522(a) imposes obli-\ngations only on the “Director” of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, not \nthe Secretary of State, who has been designated by the President to im-\nplement the initial-resettlement program.  See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 \nF.3d 309, 319 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021).  But the Refugee Act makes clear that \nthe Secretary has stepped into the Director’s shoes:  “[T]he authority of \nthe Director under the first sentence of [§ 1522(b)(1)(A)] shall be exer-\ncised by such officer as the President shall from time to time specify.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1522(b)(1)(B).  The Secretary thus must provide the resettle-\nment funding mandated by Section 1522(a). \nB.  The Suspension and Termination Violate the Im-\npoundment Control Act \nThe Impoundment Control Act limits the government’s ability to \ndefer or rescind the spending of appropriated funds.  2 U.S.C. §§ 683, 684.  \nThe suspension effected a “deferral of budget authority” by indefinitely \n“withholding or delaying the obligation or expenditure of budget author-\n20 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 27 of 37\n \nity … provided for” refugee resettlement.  2 U.S.C. § 682(1).  And the ter-\nmination permanently rescinded funds for “authorized projects or activi-\nties for which budget authority has been provided.”  Id. § 683(a).   \nYet the government did not observe the Impoundment Control Act’s \nprocedural requirements before taking these actions.  Id. §§ 683(b) (re-\nquiring rescission bill), 684(a) (special message to Congress before defer-\nral).  And because the government justified its actions based on “agency \npriorities,” App.75-80, the government has effected an impermissible pol-\nicy-based deferral, violating the Act’s mandate that deferrals be made \n“only” for three specified purposes to ensure “[c]onsistency with legisla-\ntive policy.”  2 U.S.C. § 684(b); see In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 261 \nn.1. \nC.  The Suspension and Termination Are Arbitrary and \nCapricious \nThe APA requires agency action to be “reasonable and reasonably \nexplained.”  Ohio, 603 U.S. at 292 (quotation marks omitted).  The sus-\npension and termination are neither. \nFirst, the government did not account for the irreparable damage \nto USCCB and to refugees who are losing essential services during the \n21 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 28 of 37\n \ncritical first months of their resettlement.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Re-\ngents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020).  It ignored the substantial, \nreasonable reliance interests imperiled by its sudden suspension and \nsubsequent termination.  See id.  And it failed to consider the less-dis-\nruptive, “obvious alternative[]” of halting funding only prospectively ra-\nther than for already-arrived refugees.  Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. \nv. FCC, 794 F.2d 737, 746 n.36 (D.C. Cir. 1986).   \nSecond, the government’s rationales were inadequate.  It claimed \nthe suspension was “[c]onsistent with” the President’s Foreign Aid Exec-\nutive Order.  App.21-25.  But that order applied only to “foreign assis-\ntance,” which cannot include awards to an American non-profit, for refu-\ngees  in  the  United  States,  labeled  “domestic  assistance”  by  statute.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(3).  The government’s “conclusory statements” that \nUSCCB’s  agreements  are  inconsistent  with  agency  priorities  “do  not \nmeet the requirement that ‘the agency adequately explain its result.’”  \nDickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1407 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  And the \ngovernment has provided no explanation for its refusal to reimburse pre-\nJanuary 24 expenses. \nThird, the government “fail[ed] to comply with its own regulations.”  \n22 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 29 of 37\n \nNat’l Env’t Dev. Ass’n’s Clean Air Project v. EPA, 752 F.3d 999, 1009 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted).  The suspension violated the State \nDepartment’s regulation providing that “[p]ayments for allowable costs \n[incurred under a Federal award] must not be withheld” except under \ncircumstances not relevant here.  2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) (incorporated \ninto 2 C.F.R. § 600.101).  And even if USCCB’s awards no longer effectu-\nate “agency priorities,” they can be terminated only “to the extent author-\nized by law.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  Because the termination inde-\npendently violates several statutes, it also violates Section 200.340(a). \nIII.  The Suspension and Termination Are Causing Irreparable \nHarm \nIrreparable injuries are (1) “certain and great”; and (2) “beyond re-\nmediation” through the “compensatory or other corrective relief” a court \ncan grant “in the ordinary course of litigation.”  England, 454 F.3d at 297-\n98.  Halting funding while USCCB is providing services to already-ar-\nrived refugees is inflicting on USCCB three forms of ongoing irreparable \nharm: (1) the loss of staff expertise; (2) injury to USCCB’s goodwill and \nrelationships with its partners; and (3) damage to USCCB’s programs in \nfrustration of one of its core missions.  \n23 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 30 of 37\n \nFirst, losing employees with valuable expertise and relationships is \nirreparable harm to an organization because “‘compensatory or other cor-\nrective relief’” cannot restore its lost human capital.  Id. at 297.  An or-\nganization experiences irreparable injury when it loses “skilled employ-\nees” with the “institutional knowledge and experience” to fulfill its obli-\ngations, Yorktown Sys. Grp., Inc. v. Threat Tec LLC, 108 F.4th 1287, 1296 \n(11th Cir. 2024)—even if “a new employee [is] hired,” Louisiana v. Biden, \n55 F.4th 1017, 1034 (5th Cir. 2022). \nThe suspension and termination have forced USCCB to notice ter-\nminations for 50 staff with decades of experience serving refugees, with \nmore layoffs around the corner if the unlawful termination continues.  \nApp.40-41.  USCCB lost 27 employees on March 7, and 12 more will be \nlost by March 28.  See App.63.  USCCB will imminently lose the “institu-\ntional knowledge and experience”  it needs to serve refugees.  Yorktown, \n108 F.4th at 1296.  Compensatory relief cannot undo this injury.  Louisi-\nana, 55 F.4th at 1034.   \nSecond, organizations suffer irreparable harm when a defendant \ndamages their reputation and relationships.  “‘[I]njury to reputation and \ngoodwill is not easily measured in monetary terms,’” so “it is ‘often viewed \n24 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 31 of 37\n \nas irreparable.’”  Jones v. District of Columbia, 177 F. Supp. 3d 542, 547 \n(D.D.C. 2016); see Armour & Co. v. Freeman, 304 F.2d 404, 406 (D.C. Cir. \n1962).  Damage to an organization’s relationships with its customers or \npartners is irreparable.  See Yorktown, 108 F.4th at 1297 (“[a]brupt ter-\nmination” “harm[ed] [organization’s] reputation”); Otero Sav. & Loan \nAss’n v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 665 F.2d 275, 278 (10th Cir. \n1981) (irreparable harm where plaintiff was “forced to interrupt ser-\nvices,” resulting in “‘severe confusion’” and “‘loss of good will and cus-\ntomer confidence’”). \nThe suspension and termination are damaging USCCB’s goodwill \nand relationships with its partner charities, which serve refugees in reli-\nance  on  USCCB’s  funding.    USCCB  has  been  unable  to  reimburse \n$10.4 million (and growing) in costs incurred by its partners, who have \nbegun laying off employees.  App.51-52, 56-57, 62-63, 67-68.  The serious \nrisk of future funding shortfalls makes it unlikely that these partners \nwill work with USCCB again.  App.53, 57-58.  Indeed, one agency has \nalready shuttered its refugee-resettlement arm.  See App.68.  Money \ndamages  cannot  repair  the  structural  damage  to  USCCB’s  network.  \nApp.73.   \n25 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 32 of 37\n \nThird, an organization is irreparably harmed if a defendant’s ac-\ntions make “the organization’s activities more difficult,” frustrating one \nof its bona fide “mission[s].”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  The suspension and termination have \nfrustrated one of USCCB’s core “mission[s]” by ending the funding that \nenables USCCB to assist the refugees in its care.  Id.  “[P]articipation in \nthe  Refugee  Admissions  Program  reflects  the  Catholic  Church’s \nlongstanding commitment to migrants and refugees.”  Op. 3.  Because of \nits “deeply held religious beliefs” and “consistent with the work of the \nChurch since its inception, USCCB runs the largest refugee resettlement \nagency in the United States.”  App.47.  Nearly a third of USCCB’s staff \nare dedicated to refugee resettlement.  App.62. \nWithout funding, USCCB and its subrecipients cannot continue \nproviding essential services to the thousands of recently-arrived refugees \nin its care.  Massive layoffs and permanent damage to crucial partner \nrelationships will have “crushing consequences” for USCCB’s refugee-re-\nsettlement “operations,” making it unrealistic to expect that it “could \nsimply reopen its doors” later.  Alpine Sec. Corp. v. FINRA, 121 F.4th \n1314, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  And USCCB’s “operational and investment \n26 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 33 of 37\n \nreserves cannot sustain” the program “without jeopardizing the entire \noperation of the USCCB.”  App.63.   \nAs a result, refugees in USCCB’s programs today are no longer re-\nceiving services.  Some subrecipients have stopped services altogether, \nApp.67-68, while others have been forced to seriously curtail services; \nrefugees are “on the brink of losing their new homes,” App.52, 56-57. \nNo future monetary award can retroactively redress the fact that \nthe program suspension and termination are preventing USCCB from \nassisting the thousands of refugees currently in its care whom it feels \ncalled to help.  See Newby, 838 F.3d at 8; cf. Roman Catholic Diocese of \nBrooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 19 (2020) (Church’s inability to conduct \nworship services, “‘for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably con-\nstitutes irreparable injury’”); accord App.47-48 (“[T]he funding suspen-\nsion threatens the USCCB’s ability to exercise its moral obligation to pro-\nvide for the particular refugees currently assigned to its care.”).   \n27 \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2105901            Filed: 03/14/2025      Page 34 of 37\n \nIV.  The Balance of the Equities and Public Interest Favor Re-\nlief \n“[T]here is a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental \nagencies abide by the federal laws’”; “[t]here is generally no public inter-\nest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  Newby, 838 F.3d at \n12.  Moreover, for nearly fifty years, Congress has recognized the public \ninterest in resettling refugees by continually funding services that enable \nthem to become self-sufficient. \nIt is inequitable for the government to assign USCCB nearly 7,000 \nvulnerable refugees only to suddenly rescind the funds USCCB needs to \nserve those refugees.  Nor is it equitable or in the public interest to aban-\ndon the refugees in USCCB’s care, many of whom do not speak English, \nare resettling with families, relied on the availability of initial-resettle-\nment  services,  and  face  significant  risk  of  poverty  and  homelessness \nwithout continued funding. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant the motion. \nMarch 14, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ David W.

Appellant\nhas not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal.  See\nWinter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); D.C. Circuit Handbook\nof Practice and Internal Procedures 33 (2024). \nThe Clerk is directed to enter a briefing schedule and to schedule this case for\noral argument on the first appropriate date in September 2025.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nSelena R. Gancasz \nDeputy Clerk\n* A statement by Circuit Judge Millett, dissenting from the denial of an injunction\npending appeal, is attached.\n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 2 of 9\n \nMILLETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \n \nI would grant the motion for an injunction pending appeal.   \nThe Conference of Catholic Bishops is likely to succeed on \nappeal and is suffering irreparable injuries.   \n \n1 \n \nWith respect to the likelihood of success on the merits, the \ndistrict  court  dismissed  the  case  solely  on  a  jurisdictional \nground, reasoning that the Conference’s case seeks to enforce \nonly a contractual right for money and so must proceed in the \nCourt of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491.  See United States Conference of Catholic Bishops v. \nUnited States Dep’t of State, 25-cv-00465, 2025 WL 763738, \nat *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025).  That conclusion cannot be \nreconciled with the content of the complaint, the sources of the \nrights  asserted,  or  long-settled  Supreme  Court  and  circuit \nprecedent  recognizing  that  challenges  to  the  lawfulness  of \nagency  action  are  properly  prosecuted  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act even if the plaintiff stands to \nbenefit contractually once the agencies’ legal missteps are \ncorrected. \n \nTo determine whether the Conference’s claims against the \ngovernment “sound[] in contract,” and therefore may not be \nbrought in federal district court, we “consider both ‘the source \nof the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims’ and ‘the \ntype of relief sought (or appropriate).’”  Albrecht v. Committee \non Emp. Benefits of Fed. Reserve Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d \n62, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 \nF.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  \n \nStarting with the first prong, on its face, the Conference’s \ncomplaint raises traditional claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act, not contract law.  The legal sources of the rights \nit  asserts  are  entirely  statutory,  not  contractual.    The \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 3 of 9\n2 \nConference  argues  that  the  State  Department’s  sudden, \nunreasoned,  and  unjustified  termination  of  the  Refugee \nResettlement  Program’s  funding—money  that  had  already \nbeen appropriated by Congress—violates federal law, not its \ncontract.    The  Conference  grounds  its  claims  in  the  legal \nrequirements of the Refugee Act of 1980, 8 U.S.C. § 1522, the \nImpoundment  Control  Act,  2  U.S.C.  §§ 682-684,  and  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706.   See ECF No. \n29 (Amended Compl.) ¶¶ 70-117.   \n \nThe proof of the statutory character of the claims is in the \npudding.  To decide this case, the court will have to interpret \nthose  federal  laws  and  review  the  State  Department’s \nadministrative record.  The court will have little, if any, need \nto analyze or interpret the Conference’s contracts with the State \nDepartment.  See Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. General Servs. \nAdmin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1108-1109 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (case arises \nunder the APA, not contract law, when the claims presented \n“require[] primarily an examination of the statutes”).   \n \nTo put it simply, the claims in the complaint are “not \nquestions  the  district  court  can  answer  by  examining  a \ncontractual  promise  made  by”  the  government  to  the \nConference.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1109.  And, contrary to the \ndistrict  court’s  analysis,  we  have  “explicitly  rejected  the \n‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring some reference to or \nincorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and \ntherefore directly within the Tucker Act.’”  Id. at 1107 (quoting \nMegapulse, 672 F.2d at 967-968).  To do otherwise “would \n‘deny a court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly \nbased on grounds other than a contractual relationship with the \ngovernment.’”  Id. at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at \n967-968).   \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 4 of 9\n3 \n  Turning to the second prong, the relief the Conference \nseeks  is  traditional  equitable  and  declaratory  relief—the \nmainstay  of  APA  actions.    That is  entirely  different  from \nmonetary damages under the contract.  See Crowley, 38 F.4th \nat 1107.  We have held that a complaint will not be read to seek \ncontractual monetary relief “as long as the complaint only \nrequests  non-monetary  relief  that  has  considerable \nvalue independent of any future potential for monetary relief \nand as long as the sole remedy requested is declaratory or \ninjunctive relief that is not negligible in comparison with the \npotential  monetary  recovery.”    Id.  at  1107-1108  (quoting \nKidwell v. Department of Army, Bd. for Correction of Mil. \nRecs., 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).   \n \nThe Conference’s complaint fits that bill.  Nowhere does \nit ask for money damages.  Instead, it seeks a declaratory \njudgment  that  the  Refugee  Resettlement  Program  funding \nsuspension violates federal laws, an order setting aside the \nsuspension order, an injunction preventing the government \nfrom enforcing the suspension against the Conference, and an \norder  to  the  government  to  comply  with  its  statutory  and \nregulatory  obligations.    These  are  equitable  remedies  well \nwithin the district court’s APA domain.  ECF No. 29 (Amended \nCompl.) at 40-41.  \n \nTo be sure, one effect of that equitable relief may be that \npayments required by law flow to the Conference because it \nhas a contract.  But that is not enough to turn the complaint into \none for contract damages.  The Supreme Court has  “long \nrecognized” that “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require \none party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to \ncharacterize  the  relief  as  ‘money  damages.’”    Bowen  v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988).  In Bowen, the \nSupreme Court held that a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 5 of 9\n4 \ncompelling  a  federal  agency  to  make  payments  owed  to \nMassachusetts  under  its  Medicaid  contract  with  the \ngovernment was a proper APA suit, because “the orders are for \nspecific relief (they undo the Secretary’s refusal to reimburse \nthe State) rather than for money damages (they do not provide \nrelief  that  substitutes  for  that  which  ought  to  have  been \ndone)[.]”  Id. at 910.  As a result, the case fell within the district \ncourt’s APA jurisdiction—not the Claims Court’s Tucker Act \njurisdiction, as the Secretary had argued.  Id. at 904. \n \nIn so reasoning, the Supreme Court endorsed this circuit’s \nprecedent in Maryland Department of Human Resources v. \nDepartment of Health & Human Services, 763 F.2d 1441 (D.C. \nCir. 1985).  In that case, Judge Bork, writing for the court, \nexplained that, in a case brought under the APA, “injunctive \nrelief enjoining defendants from reducing funds otherwise due \nto plaintiffs” is “not a claim for money damages, although it is \na claim that would require the payment of money by the federal \ngovernment.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 894 (quoting Maryland \nDep’t, 763 F.2d at 1446) (formatting modified).  As Judge Bork \nexplained, such payment would be separate and apart from \nmoney damages—that is, “money in compensation for the \nlosses * * * that [a plaintiff] will suffer or has suffered by virtue \nof the withholding of those funds.”  Id. (quoting Maryland \nDep’t, 763 F.2d at 1446).   \n \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Bowen and our precedent \nin Maryland Department are squarely on point.  Or so the \nConference is likely to succeed in arguing.  The Conference \nseeks  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  for  the  State \nDepartment’s  assertedly  unlawful  termination  of  Refugee \nResettlement Program funding.  That is, this lawsuit aims to \n“require the payment of money by the federal government” that \na federal statute, not a contract, mandates.  Maryland Dep’t, \n763 F.3d at 1446.        \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 6 of 9\n5 \n \nIn short, “[e]xclusive jurisdiction in [the Court of Federal \nClaims] under the Tucker Act does not lie ‘merely because a \nplaintiff hints at some interest in a monetary reward from the \nfederal government or because success on the merits may \nobligate the United States to pay the complainant.’” Crowley, \n38 F.4th at 1108 (quoting Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284) (formatting \nmodified).  Given that settled law and the source of the rights \nand type of relief that the Conference asserts, it is likely that \nthe Conference’s APA lawsuit belongs in the district court and \nnot the Court of Claims.   \n \n2 \n \n  In the absence of a preliminary injunction, the funding \nsuspension will cause “certain and great” irreparable injury to \nthe Conference and its core programs before we can resolve \nthis appeal.  Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985); see also League of Women Voters of United \nStates v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \n \nThe funding suspension has already forced the Conference \nto lay off over half of its staff working on refugee resettlement \nprograms (fifty of its ninety-two employees), which is the \nlargest subcomponent of the Conference’s staff and operations.  \nECF No. 22-4 (Fuller Decl.) ¶ 6.  Without an injunction, more \nlayoffs are imminent.  See Conference Mot. For Injunction \nPending Appeal at 2.  While the Conference has been able to \npare back its refugee resettlement services in an orderly manner \nduring  reductions  in  refugee  admissions  under  past \nadministrations, the sudden “funding suspension, with its lack \nof clarity and the subsequent stoppage of payments, has sent \n[its] refugee resettlement program into a tailspin.”  ECF No. \n22-6 (Canny Decl.) ¶ 5.  The Conference states that the “rapid, \nforced layoffs that [it] is now experiencing will damage its \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 7 of 9\n6 \ninstitutional knowledge and relationships in a categorically \nmore severe way than any staff reductions [it] has had to \nimplement  in  the  past.”    Id.    This  is  because  “[t]he \ngovernment’s recent, abrupt funding suspension has made” \nefforts  to  preserve  institutional  knowledge  “nearly \nimpossible.”  Id.  It is “difficult[], if not impossib[le]” to \n“quantify[] in monetary terms the injury” the Conference will \nsuffer from “losing highly skilled and experienced employees” \nin such an abrupt manner and enormous scale.  Yorktown Sys. \nGrp. Inc. v. Threat Tec LLC, 108 F.4th 1287, 1296 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \nIn addition, as a result of the funding suspension, the \nConference  can  no  longer  advance  payments  to  its \nsubrecipients, who provide the direct services to refugees in the \nConference’s care under its cooperative agreements with the \ngovernment.    ECF  No.  22-4  (Fuller  Decl.)  ¶ 12.    The \nConference represents that it has been unable to reimburse \n$10.4 million in costs incurred by its partners, $9.75 million of \nwhich is for services rendered prior to the State Department’s \nissuance of its suspension letter on January 24, 2025.  Id. ¶ 9.  \nThe Conference’s subrecipients too have had to lay off staff as \na  result  of  the  funding  suspension.    Id.    Crucially,  the \nConference  explains  that,  “[i]f  the  funding  suspension \ncontinues, more than 5,000 refugees currently in its and its \nsubrecipient partners’ care will be left without the resources or \nassistance  promised  by  the  cooperative  agreements”  and \nordered by Congress.  Id.; see also ECF No. 22-2 (Brown \nDecl.) ¶ 7 (As a result of the suspension, a subrecipient’s “cash \nreserves used to pay for rental assistance, food, and clothing for \n[its] refugees have already depleted[,]” and “any payment now \nrequires [it] to reallocate resources from [its] other charitable \nprograms, thus straining [the] entire organization.”); ECF No. \n22-3 (Colbert Decl.) ¶ 6 (As a result of the suspension, another \nsubrecipient has “been able to provide only the most basic \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 8 of 9\n7 \nresettlement  services  to  [its]  refugees,  drawing  on  limited \nfinancial reserves to provide basic aid such as food, utilities, \nand rental assistance.”).     \n \nThat the suspension has forced the Conference to abruptly \nhalt payments to its subrecipients and required its subrecipients \nto endure financial strain is already causing, and will continue \nto cause, irreparable harm to the Conference’s goodwill and \nability to partner with other organizations in the future.  Several \nof  the  Conference’s  partners  have  stated  that  the  sudden \nsuspension  has  made  it  unlikely  that  they  will  resume \npartnering with the Conference on its refugee resettlement \nprograms in the future.  ECF No. 22-2 (Brown Decl.) ¶ 11; ECF \nNo. 22-3 (Colbert Decl.) ¶ 10.  One partner has stated that it \nhas  already  begun  the  process  of  permanently  closing  its \nrefugee resettlement program.  ECF No. 22-5 (Main Decl.) ¶ 8.  \nSuch  loss  of  goodwill  constitutes  irreparable  harm.    See \nYorktown Sys. Grp., 108 F.4th at 1296 (recognizing irreparable \ninjury to a plaintiff’s “reputation”); Armour & Co. v. Freeman, \n304 F.2d 404, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1962) (recognizing irreparable \ninjury to a plaintiff’s “good name”); see also Open Tech. Fund \nv.  Pack,  No.  20-5195  (D.C.  Cir.  July  21,  2020)  (citing \nBellsouth Telecomm., Inc. v. MCIMetro Access Transmission \nServs., LLC, 425 F.3d 964, 970 (11th Cir. 2005) (“[L]oss of \ncustomers and goodwill is an irreparable injury.”)). \n \nThe government argues that the Conference’s stated harms \ncan be redressed by a money judgment, making an injunction \ninappropriate.  Gov. Opp. 25.  Not so.  Most importantly, it is \nimpossible for a money judgment months or years from now to \nredress  the  Conference’s  present  inability  to  execute  its \norganizational programs to assist refugees already in its care \nbecause of the cooperative agreements.  In addition, given the \nunprecedented  decimation  of  the  Conference’s  institutional \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2108313            Filed: 03/28/2025      Page 9 of 9\n8 \nexpertise and partner relationships, it is far from clear that a \nmoney judgment could redress the Conference’s layoffs.   \n \n  On its side of the scale, the government asserts a public \ninterest in avoiding an intrusion on executive powers.  Gov. \nOpp. 23-24.  But the government does not differentiate the \nharm that would result from enjoining the agency in this case \nfrom the harm that generally results from enjoining an agency \nin all other cases where APA violations are found.   \n \nThe government adds that this case implicates foreign \naffairs  because  the  “President  considers  ‘humanitarian \nconcerns’ and ‘the national interest’ in making decisions about \nrefugee  admissions.”    Gov.  Opp.  23  (citing  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1157(a)(2)).  That is off base.  This case has nothing to do \nwith  foreign  policy  or  refugee  admissions.    The  Refugee \nResettlement Program is a domestic program caring for those \nwho  have already been lawfully admitted to the United States.  \nProviding for the general welfare of those in the United States \nwith  domestic  legislation  is  solidly  within  Congress’s \nwheelhouse.  The State Department’s job is to administer that \nlaw under the statutory terms and with the statutory funds set \nby  Congress,  and  within  the  rules  of  reasonable  agency \ndecisionmaking set by the APA.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).   \n \nBecause  the  Conference  is  likely  to  succeed  in  its \njurisdictional appeal and because the equities weigh decisively \nin the Conference’s favor, I respectfully dissent from the denial \nof the Conference’s motion for an injunction pending appeal. \n ",

See Exec. Order No. 14,169, Reevaluating & Realigning United States Foreign \nAid, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,610 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“Foreign Aid Order”) §§ 2, 3.  As a result, the Department \nof State (“Department”) paused all foreign aid related to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program \n(“USRAP” or the “Program”), to include payments to refugee resettlement agencies. \nPlaintiff U.S. Conference for Catholic Bishops, a national refugee resettlement agency, \nbrings claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) to enjoin the Program from \ncontinuing the pause in payments and to direct the Program to promptly reimburse Plaintiff for \nany expenses.  Plaintiff’s motion fails because the government has not waived sovereign immunity, \nor in the alternative, Plaintiff’s claims are moot.  Further, the Department’s implementation of the \nForeign Aid Order is not subject to notice and comment rulemaking procedures. \nAccordingly, for the reasons discussed below, the Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s claims \nfor lack of jurisdiction or failure to state a claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (6). \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \nI.  Refugee Admission \nThe Refugee Act of 1980 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) to \nestablish “a permanent and systematic procedure for the admission to this country of refugees of \nspecial humanitarian concern to the United States, and to provide comprehensive and uniform \nprovisions for [their] effective resettlement.”  Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102, § 101(b).  The \nRefugee Act provides that the maximum number of refugees that may be admitted annually “shall \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 7 of 22\nbe such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after \nappropriate consultation [with Congress], is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in \nthe national interest.”  8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2). \nSubject to numerical limits set annually by the President, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity has discretion to admit “any refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign country, is \ndetermined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and is admissible (except \nas otherwise provided under [8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(3)]) as an immigrant” under the INA.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1157(c)(1);  see  also  8  U.S.C.  §§  1101(a)(42)  (defining  “refugee”),  1182(a)  (general \ninadmissibility grounds).  Which refugees are determined to be “of special humanitarian concern” \nto the United States for the purpose of refugee resettlement is determined in the Report to Congress \non Proposed Refugee Admissions prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.  Zerbinopoulos Decl. \n(ECF No. 14-1) ¶ 9.  Refugees admitted in accordance with this provision are sometimes referred \nto as “principal” applicants or refugees. \nIn addition, certain individuals who do not meet the statutory definition of a refugee under \n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) may nonetheless be entitled to refugee status if they are accompanying or \n“following-to-join” a principal refugee.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(2)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 207.7(a).   To \nobtain “derivative refugee” status, an applicant must be the spouse or unmarried child under the \nage of 21 of a principal refugee and must also be admissible (except as otherwise provided under \n8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(3)) as an immigrant under the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(2)(A). Derivative \nrefugees who are either in the physical company of the principal refugee when admitted to the \nUnited States or admitted within four months of the principal refugee’s admission are called \n“accompanying” refugees.  8 C.F.R. § 207.7(a).  Derivative refugees who seek admission more \nthan four months after the principal refugee are called “following-to-join” refugees.  Id. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 8 of 22\nThe INA provides only that such derivative refugees are entitled to refugee status if the \nappropriate application or petition is processed and their relationship as the spouse or child of a \nprincipal refugee and their admissibility are established.1  See 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(2)(A).  The INA \ndoes  not,  however,  entitle  derivative  refugees  to  be  admitted  to  the  United  States  without \nqualification.  The admission of a derivative who has obtained refugee status is contingent on there \nbeing room under the subsection allocation under which the principal refugee’s admission is \ncharged, as well as, by implication, the annual refugee limit, set by the President, and that \nindividual establishing their eligibility for admission.  Id.   \nII.  Refugee Resettlement \nFollowing admission, the United States, through public and private organizations, provides \nresettlement services to assist refugees in achieving self-sufficiency.  To administer the services, \nCongress established the Office of Refugee Resettlement (or “ORR”) in the Department of Health \nand Human Services, which is headed by a Director.  8 U.S.C. § 1521(a).  “The function of the \nOffice and its Director is to fund and administer (directly or through arrangements with other \nFederal agencies), in consultation with the Secretary of State, programs” to provide resettlement \nservices.  8 U.S.C. § 1521(b).  The Director \nshall,  to  the  extent  of  available  appropriations,  (i)  make  available  sufficient \nresources for employment training and placement in order to achieve economic \nself-sufficiency among refugees as quickly as possible, (ii) provide refugees with \nthe opportunity to acquire sufficient English language training to enable them to \nbecome effectively resettled as quickly as possible, (iii) insure that cash assistance \nis made available to refugees in such a manner as not to discourage their economic \n \n1   Accompanying derivatives are processed via Form I-590, Registration for Classification as \nRefugee, which is filed in conjunction with the Form I-590 by the principal refugee overseas. \nFollowing-to-join derivatives are processed via Form I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, \nwhich the admitted principal refugee files on behalf of the derivative, who may be overseas or in \nthe United States. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 9 of 22\nself-sufficiency, in accordance with subsection (e)(2), and (iv) insure that women \nhave the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction. \n8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A); see also 45 C.F.R. § 400.11(a).  Accordingly, the Office of Refugee \nResettlement provides a majority of the services for resettlement, e.g., cash assistance and medical \nservices for up to twelve months, child welfare services for unaccompanied refugee children, and \nemployment assistance and English language learning for up to five years.  8 U.S.C. 1522(c)-(e), \n45 CFR Part 400, Subparts E, G and I. \nIn addition to the services required under section 1522(a)(1)(A), the Secretary of State “is \nauthorized, to make grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for initial \nresettlement (including initial reception and placement with sponsors) of refugees in the United \nStates.”  8 U.S.C. §§ 1522(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(B); 3 Pub. Papers. 2879 (Jan. 13, 1981) (Exec. Off. \nOf the Pres.) (authorizing the Secretary of State under section 1522(b)(1)(B) to exercise the \nauthority).  Accordingly, the Secretary of State through cooperative agreements, provides initial \nresettlement services, which last between thirty and ninety days and include: \n•  Agreement  to  accept  refugees  for  management  by  local  resettlement \naffiliates; \n•  Pre-arrival resettlement planning, including placement and arrangement for \nhealth care requirements, as needed;  \n•  Reception on arrival, including transportation from the airport to living \nquarters;  \n•  Basic needs support (including identification and securing of housing, as \nwell as provision of furnishings, food, and clothing);  \n•  Cultural orientation;  \n•  Assistance with access to healthcare, employment, education, and other \nservices, as needed;  \n•  Assistance with applying for and/or enrolling in other benefits and services, \nas appropriate and as eligible \n•  Development and implementation of an initial service plan for each refugee. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 10 of 22\n2d Zerbinopoulos Decl. (ECF No. 25-1) ¶¶ 10, 11. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nI.  The Cooperative Agreements \nState Department’s Bureau of Population and Migration (“PRM” or “Migration Bureau”) \nawarded Plaintiff two cooperative agreements to provide initial resettlement services for fiscal \nyear 2025 (collectively, the “Agreements”).  Cooperative Agmt. SPRMCO24CA0342 (ECF No. 5-\n4), Cooperative Agmt. SPRMCO24CA0336 (ECF No. 5-5).  Pursuant to the Agreements, Plaintiff \nreceived 6,259 refugees, 1,796 Afghan or Iraqi special immigrants, and four Amerasians special \nimmigrants for provision of initial services.  2d Zerbinopoulos Decl. (ECF No. 25-1) ¶ 14.  As of \nApril 24, 2025, all of the individuals will be past the initial ninety-day resettlement services \nperiod.  Id. \nThe  Agreements  require  Plaintiff  to  provide  core  services  for  the  individuals,  e.g., \nreception services to apprise the refugee of the availability of initial housing.  See, e.g., Cooperative \nAgmt. SPRMCO24CA0342 (ECF No. 5-4) § 16.2 ¶ vii (describing core services).  The applicable \nadministrative requirements for the Agreements are at 2 C.F.R. Part 200 Subparts A through F and \n2 C.F.R. Parts 600 and 601.  Id., Std. Terms & Conds. for Fed. Awards. \nAs of February 24, 2025, Plaintiff has submitted six requests for payment of expenses to \nthe Migration Bureau, totaling $13,015,130.49.  2d Zerbinopoulos Decl. (ECF No. 25-1) ¶ 15. \nII.  The Executive Orders \nOn January 20, 2025, the President signed Executive Order No. 14,163, Realigning the \nUnited States Refugee Admissions Program, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,459 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“Refugee \nOrder”), which suspended admission of refugees under the Program, pursuant to the President’s \nauthority under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(f) and 1185(a) and based on the President’s finding that “[t]he \nUnited States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 11 of 22\ninto its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for \nAmericans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of \nrefugees.”  Refugee Order §§ 1, 3(a)  The Refugee Order also suspended “decisions on applications \nfor refugee status.”  Id. § 3(b).  Notwithstanding the suspension, the Refugee Order allows for \nadmission of refugees on a case-by-case basis should the Secretaries of Homeland Security and \nState jointly determine such admission is in the national interest and would not threaten national \nsecurity or welfare, and sets a process for resuming refugee admissions in the future.  Id. §§ 3(c), 4.  \nThat same day, the President also signed the Foreign Aid Order, i.e., Executive Order \nNo. 14,169,  which  required  agency  heads  to  “immediately  pause  new  obligations  and \ndisbursements of development assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-\ngovernmental organizations, international organizations, and contractors pending reviews of such \nprograms . . . to be conducted within 90 days.”  Foreign Aid Order § 3(a).  The Foreign Aid Order \nalso required agency heads to review each foreign assistance program under guidelines provided \nby the Secretary of State to determine “whether to continue, modify, or cease each foreign \nassistance program.”  Id. § 3(b)–(c).  Notwithstanding the pause, the Foreign Aid Order allows the \nSecretary of State to waive the ninety-day pause on incurring new development assistance funds \nand allows for the resumption of programs prior to the end of the ninety-day period with the \nSecretary of State’s approval.  Id. § 3(d)–(e). \nIII.  Implementation of the Executive Orders  \nIn the days before the administration change, the incoming administration informed senior \nofficials in the State Department’s Migration Bureau that President Trump intended to suspend \nrefugee admissions under the Program through executive order.  Zerbinopoulos Decl. (ECF \nNo. 14-1) ¶ 18.  In anticipation of the Refugee Order, the State Department, upon learning that the \nsuspension would go into effect on January 27, 2025, cancelled all travel after 12:00 p.m. on \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 12 of 22\nJanuary 20, 2025.  Id. ¶ 20.  The State Department did so out of an abundance of caution because \nmost refugees travel to the United States from around the world, a trip that involves multiple \nlayovers and can take multiple days.  Id.  Consequently, the State Department cancelled travel \nscheduled between January 20 and 27, 2025 to avoid the not insignificant risk that refugees would \nnot arrive in the United States before the suspension went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on January 27, \n2025, and to avoid the possibility that some refugees would be stranded at a U.S. port of entry or \nat an airport in a foreign country.  Id. \nIn  response  to  the  Refugee  Order’s  directive  to  suspend  any  decisions  on  refugee \napplications, the State Department also suspended the Program’s processing activities.  Id. ¶ 21.  \nThe suspension was intended to prevent inefficiencies, as it would be illogical for the Government \nand resettlement partners to move refugees to transit centers or conduct pre-departure activities \nwhen refugee admissions were suspended.  Id. ¶¶ 21–22.  And some processing activities, such as \nmedical exams and security checks, expire after a certain amount of time.  Id. ¶ 22.  Further, the \nState Department could not be sure when and which classes of refugees the President would find \nto be in the United States’ interest upon resumption of refugee admissions.  Id. \nFollowing the Foreign Aid Order’s directive to immediately cease foreign aid payments, \nthe State Department, on January 24, 2025, issued 25 STATE 6828, an “All Diplomatic and \nConsular Posts” (or “ALDAC”) cable “paus[ing] all new obligations of funding, pending a review, \nfor foreign assistance programs funded by or through the Department and USAID.”  Id. ¶ 26.  This \npause applied to assistance funded from accounts in title III of the Department of State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, to include the Migration and Refugee \nAssistance account, from which funding for initial reception and placement services is provided \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 13 of 22\nto resettlement agencies.  Id. ¶¶ 23–26.  Thus, the Order’s halt on foreign aid necessarily included \npayments to resettlement agencies in the United States.  Id. ¶¶ 24–26. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nRule 12(b)(1) requires dismissal of claims where a court “lack[s] jurisdiction over the \nsubject matter.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  “Rule 12(b)(1) presents a threshold challenge to the \nCourt’s jurisdiction . . . [and] the Court is obligated to determine whether it has subject-matter \njurisdiction in the first instance.”  Curran v. Holder, 626 F. Supp. 2d 30, 32 (D.D.C. 2009) (internal \ncitation and quotation marks omitted).  “A federal court presumptively lacks jurisdiction in a \nproceeding until a party demonstrates that jurisdiction exists.”  Commodity Futures Trading \nComm’n v. Nahas, 738 F.2d 487, 492 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. \nCo. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (“[I]t is presumed that a cause lies outside [the federal \ncourts’] limited jurisdiction.”).  “If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter \njurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). \nA court may resolve a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) in two ways: \na facial challenge or a factual challenge.  In a facial challenge, the court may decide the motion \nbased solely on the factual allegations in the Complaint.  See Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Sci., \n974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  In contrast, to determine the existence of jurisdiction in a \nfactual challenge, a court may look beyond the allegations of the complaint, consider affidavits \nand other extrinsic information, and ultimately weigh the conflicting evidence.  See Jerome Stevens \nPharm., Inc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting that, with respect to a factual \nchallenge, the district court may consider materials outside of the pleadings to determine whether \nit has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims); Herbert, 974 F.2d at 197 (same). \nRule 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a complaint fails to “state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  To survive a motion to dismiss, \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 14 of 22\n“a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that \nis plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A court need not accept as \ntrue, however, “a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,” nor an inference unsupported \nby the facts set forth in the complaint.  Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. \nCir. 2006).  Mere “labels and conclusions” and “formulaic recitation[s] of the elements of a cause \nof action” are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n555 (2007).  Rather, the complaint must “suggest a plausible scenario that shows that the pleader \nis entitled to relief,” Jones v. Horne, 634 F.3d 588, 595–96 (D.C. Cir. 2011), and must set forth \n“enough [facts] to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  \n“The plausibility standard . . . asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n“In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court may consider the facts alleged in \nthe complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint, or \ndocuments  upon  which  the  plaintiff’s  complaint  necessarily  relies  even  if  the  document  is \nproduced not by the parties.”  Busby v. Capital One, N.A., 932 F. Supp. 2d 114, 133–34 (D.D.C. \n2013) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  “[A] document need not be mentioned by \nname to be considered ‘referred to’ or ‘incorporated by reference’ into the complaint.”  Strumsky \nv. Wash. Post Co., 842 F. Supp. 2d 215, 218 (D.D.C. 2012) (internal citation omitted). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Government Has Not Waived Sovereign Immunity \nCongress’s waiver of sovereign immunity in the APA excludes “authority to grant relief if \nany other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is \nsought.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.   Here, the Tucker Act impliedly forbids the application of APA Section \n702 to Plaintiff’s complaint. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 15 of 22\n“The Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity for actions ‘founded . . . [upon] any express \nor implied contract with the United States’ . . . for suits brought in the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims.”  Yee v. Jewell, 228 F. Supp. 3d 48, 55 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)).2  \n“[T]he D.C.

Dep’t of Army, 56 F.3d 279, \n284 (D.C. Cir. 1995), (2) it ‘is essentially a contract action,’ Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits \nof the Fed. Rsrv. Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2004), and (3) the [Claims Court] \nwould have jurisdiction over the matter[.]”  Am. Near E. Refugee Aid v. Agency for Int’l Dev., Civ. \nA. No. 21-3184 (CRC), 2023 WL 10669678, at *5 (D.D.C.

Mar. 11, 2025). \n \n2   Because  Plaintiff  seeks  “in  essence”  more  than  $10,000  in  monetary  relief—about \n$24 million, the District Court would not have concurrent jurisdiction under the “Little Tucker \nAct.” 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 16 of 22\nMoreover, Plaintiff further defines the point of this suit: money.  E.g. Pl.’s Supp. Mem. \n(ECF No. 22) at 10 (“The government’s refusal to reimburse [Plaintiff’s] expenses pursuant to its \ncooperative agreements is arbitrary and capricious because it violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6)—\nan  [Office  of  Management  and  Budget]  regulation  governing  federal  grants  that  the  State \nDepartment has incorporated into its own regulations[.]”).  Further, Plaintiff explains: \nNor is there any dispute that the reimbursement requests [Plaintiff] has submitted \nare for “allowable costs” under the terms of its agreements, or that [Plaintiff] \nremains  within  the  agreements’  “period[s]  of  performance”—which  run  until \nSeptember 30, 2025.  \nYet  the  government  nevertheless  has  impermissibly  “withheld”  payment  for \nallowable costs by refusing—through its Refugee Funding Suspension—to process \n[Plaintiff’s] reimbursement requests in the ordinary course.   \nId. at 11.  The “ordinary course” Plaintiff alludes to is the course of the Agreements.  Indeed, \nPlaintiff acknowledges that “it has asked the government to comply with federal law and the terms \nof its cooperative agreements by resuming the processing of reimbursement requests in the same \nway and on a similar timeline as it always has.”  Pl.’s Mem. (ECF No. 5-2) at 15.  But where \nclaimants “simply seek to receive the amount [agency] promised,” the “true nature of” the claim \nwas for compensatory money damages and not equitable relief.”  Boaz, 995 F.3d at 1368.  \nImportantly, “damages are always the remedy for breach of contract.”  United States v. Winstar \nCorp., 518 U.S. 839, 885 (1996).  “Federal courts do not have the power to order specific \nperformance by the United States of its alleged contractual obligations.”  Coggeshall Dev. Corp. \nv. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989).   \nPlaintiff’s insistence that there is not a contract claim in the face of evidence to the contrary \nis just the sort of argument the D.C. Circuit has cautioned against, explaining that “plaintiffs may \ncircumvent Tucker Act jurisdiction by disguising claims for monetary relief as ones for injunctive \nrelief,” Am. Near E., 2023 WL 10669678, at *5, and has “cautioned plaintiffs that [the Circuit] \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 17 of 22\n‘prohibit[s] . . . the creative drafting of complaints,’ for example, by ‘disguis[ing]’ a claim for \nmoney damages as one for equitable relief, to avoid the jurisdictional consequences of the Tucker \nAct,”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284; and citing Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 969 (D.C. \nCir. 1982)).  The D.C. Circuit has therefore instructed that the “plain language of a complaint . . . \ndoes not necessarily settle the question of Tucker Act jurisdiction,” Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284 \n(cleaned up), and that courts should look to the complaint’s “substance, not merely its form.”  Id.; \nsee also Long Term Care Pharm. All. v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., 498 F. Supp. 2d 187, 194 (D.D.C. \n2007) (“court must look to the ‘substance of the remedy sought . . . rather than the label placed on \nthat remedy.” (quoting Watkins v. Westinghouse Hanford Co., 12 F.3d 1517, 1528 n.5 (9th \nCir.1993))); see also Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 255 (1993)). \nB.  Plaintiff’s Claim Is Essentially a Contract Action \nTo determine if this is essentially a contract action, the Court must consider, “whether the \nCooperative Agreement is indeed a contract,” and “it is the source of [Plaintiff’s claim.”  Am. Near \nE., 2023 WL 10669678, at *6. \n1.  The Cooperative Agreement is a Contract \nThe Agreements “appear[] to satisfy the requirements of a contract with the government—\n‘mutual intent to contract including an offer and acceptance, consideration, and a Government \nrepresentative who had actual authority to bind the Government.’”  Id. (citing United States v. \nPresident & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 323 F. Supp. 2d 151, 164 (D. Mass. 2004) (citing Trauma \nServ. Grp. v. United States, 104 F.3d 1321, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1997), and holding that cooperative \nagreements between USAID and Harvard University “constitute[d] contracts to assist Russia in \ndeveloping  capital  markets  and  foreign  investments”)).    Consideration  exists  because  the \nDepartment intended to “benefit economically and otherwise from” the initial resettlement services \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 18 of 22\nthrough the Cooperative Agreements.  See President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 323 F.2d at 165.  \nIndeed, the benefits to the Department are explicitly acknowledged in the agreement itself, which \nprovides that the objectives of the agreement is to provide initial refugee settlement services.  See, \ne.g., Cooperative Agmt. SPRMCO24CA0342 (ECF No. 5-4) §3.2. \n2.  Plaintiff’s Claim Arises out of the Cooperative Agreement \n“When deciding if a claim sounds in contract, courts consider ‘the source of the rights upon \nwhich the plaintiff bases its claims’ and ‘the type of relief sought.’”  Am. Near E., 2023 WL \n10669678, at *6 (quoting Albrecht, 357 F.3d at 68).  \nClearly, “[t]he source of the right sought here arises from” the Agreements.  Id. (citing \nSpectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (rejecting argument \nthat the Debt Collection Act created the substantive right to the remedy sought by plaintiffs and \nnoting that the right to payments were “created in the first instance by the contract”)).  The action \nthat Plaintiff challenges is the State Department’s suspension of the Agreements.  As such, the \nterms of Agreements will determine whether the Department had the authority to suspend the \nAgreements to assess its priorities.   \nMoreover, all other factors that courts have traditionally looked to in determining whether \nthe contract is the source of a claimed right similarly led to the conclusion that the Agreements are \nthe source of Plaintiff’s claimed right in this case.  For example, courts look to whether the \ngovernment is a party to the contract.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (distinguishing Spectrum, where \nthe government had been part of the agreement, which “squarely indicate[ed] that the claims \nagainst”  the  government  “arose  under  the  contract.”).    Here  the  government—the  State \nDepartment—is a party.  Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff seeks “in essence” \nmore than $10,000 in monetary damages, see supra, a “‘prototypical contract remedy’” that is \n“‘specific to actions that sound in contract.’”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 (citing Perry Cap. LLC \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 19 of 22\nv. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting A & S Council Oil Co. v. Lader, 56 F.3d \n234, 240 (D.C. Cir. 1995))).  Thus, Plaintiff’s claim arises out of the Agreements. \n3.  Plaintiff’s Action Could Have Properly been Brought in the Claims Court \nThe District Court “can only be deprived of jurisdiction if the action can properly be \nbrought in the Court of Federal Claims.”  Am. Near E., 2023 WL 10669678, at *6 (citing Yee, \n228 F. Supp. 3d at 56 (noting that the D.C. Circuit has “categorically reject[ed] the suggestion that \na federal district court can be deprived of jurisdiction by the Tucker Act when no jurisdiction lies \nin the Court of Federal Claims” (citing Tootle, 446 F.3d at 176-77))).  There is little doubt that a \nTucker Act claim, alleging the breach of a money-mandating contract, may be brought in the \nClaims Court, as long as it is brought within the six-year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. § 2501.  \nJurisdiction exists in the Federal Circuit over “money-mandating” contracts, and cooperative \nagreements “have been held to be contracts within Tucker Act jurisdiction when all the requisite \nelements of a contract were present.”  Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare v. United States, 48 Fed. Cl. 785, \n790 (2001) (further noting that it “is not this Court’s position that grants can never be contracts \nwithin Tucker Act jurisdiction”); see also San Antonio Hous. Auth. v. United States, 143 Fed. Cl. \n425, 462 (2019); Moore v. United States, 48 Fed. Cl. 394, 397 (2000) (noting that “this court and \nits predecessor have also concluded that jurisdiction lies under the Tucker Act to consider alleged \nbreaches of grants or cooperative agreements”).  As such, Plaintiff could have brought his claims \nin the Claims Court.  \n*  *  * \nIn short, Plaintiff cannot meet its burden to establish that the claims fall within an \napplicable waiver of sovereign immunity and that this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction.  \nAlthough  Plaintiff  superficially  invokes  the  APA,  which  waives  sovereign  immunity  as  to \nnonmonetary claims, Plaintiff’s own request for relief show that its claims seek payment of money \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 20 of 22\nand turn on the terms of the Agreements.  As such, Plaintiff has not established that sovereign \nimmunity is waived in this Court.  Therefore, the Court should dismiss the complaint for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). \nII.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Moot \nA “situation in which a court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction is if the case becomes \nmoot—that is, when ‘the issues presented are no longer “live” or the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest in the outcome.’”  Fateh v. Blinken, Civ. A. No. 23-1277 (RCL), 2024 WL \n864378, at *4 (D.D.C. Feb. 29, 2024) (quoting City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 287 \n(2000)).  “Under the mootness doctrine, we cannot decide a case if ‘events have so transpired that \nthe decision will neither presently affect the parties’ rights nor have a more-than-speculative \nchance of affecting them in the future.’”  Reid v. Inch, 920 F.3d 828, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting \nClarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 701 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en banc)).  “If an intervening \ncircumstance deprives the plaintiff of a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit, at any point \nduring litigation, the action can no longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot.”  Genesis \nHealthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \nHere,  Plaintiff  seeks  for  the  Court  to  “[e]njoin—temporarily,  preliminarily,  and \npermanently—Defendants from taking any action enforcing or implementing against USCCB the \nRefugee Funding Suspension, Rubio Memo, or Foreign Aid Executive Order.”  See Compl. (ECF \nNo. 1) at Prayer for Relief § 3.  Yet, a decision from this Court to enjoin any purported policy \nwould be forward-facing, even were it justified, and, thus, would fail to redress Plaintiff’s asserted \ninjury, which is the Department’s past suspension of the Agreements.  See COMED v. HHS, 671 \nF.3d 1275, 1279–80 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (affirming dismissal, for lack of standing, of a claim seeking \nto enjoin certain vaccines, because past injuries are not redressable by prospective injunctive \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 21 of 22\nrelief).    Importantly,  while  the  Agreements  “require  USCCB  to  assume  responsibility  for \nsponsorship of the refugees assigned to it under [the Agreements],” “USCCB must then assist \nrefugees . . . during the first 90 days they are in the United States.”  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 41.  Yet, \nas of April 24, 2025, any refugees assigned to Plaintiff would no longer be in the first 90 days that \nthey are in the United States.  2d Zerbinopoulos Decl. (ECF No. 25-1), Ex. 1 (listing the dates of \nadmission).  As such, Plaintiff’s obligations under the Agreements would expire on April 24, 2025. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s claim would be moot.  Therefore, the Court should dismiss the \ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). \nIII.  Implementation of an Executive Order Is Not Subject to Notice and Comment \n5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) exempts, “a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to \npublic property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts” from notice-and-comment rule making.  5 \nU.S.C. § 553(a)(2); see also Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 196 (1993) (“Section 553 has no \napplication, for example, to ‘a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public \nproperty, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.’” (quoting section 553(a)(2)).  The Department’s \nimplementation of the executive orders, pausing payments under the agreement with Plaintiff \nclearly involves “loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(1).  As such, the State \nDepartment was exempt from the requirement of section 553(b).  See Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Snow, \n561 F.2d 227, 232 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (exempting from notice and comment rulemaking procedure \nregulations governing the Federal Aid Highway grant program). \nTherefore, the Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s notice and comment claim for failure to \nstate a claim. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss \nPlaintiff’s complaint. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 47-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 22 of 22\nDated:  April 21, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \nEDWARD R.

Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 7(m), the undersigned counsel, via electronic \nmail, requested Plaintiff’s position on subject motion.  Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that Plaintiff \noppose the relief sought in this motion. \nARGUMENT \nWhere a litigant seeks the “judicial review of administrative agency actions”, the Court’s \nLocal Rules require the filing of a certified index of an administrative record simultaneously with \nany dispositive motion.  Specifically, Local Rule 7(n) provides:  \n[i]n cases involving the judicial review of administrative agency actions, unless \notherwise ordered by the Court, the agency must file a certified list of the contents \nof the administrative record with the Court within 30 days following service of the \nanswer to the complaint or simultaneously with the filing of a dispositive motion, \nwhichever occurs first. \nLCvR 7(n)(1).  \nThe Court does not need to the administrative record to resolve Plaintiff’s claims.  Plaintiff \nbrings several claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

Courts in \nthis district have excused defendants from the obligation to compile an administrative record in \nsimilar circumstances—when the record is unnecessary to evaluate the motion to dismiss.  See, \ne.g., Connecticut v. U.S. Dep’t. of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 3d 279, 294 (D.D.C. 2018) (granting relief \nbecause the practice in this judicial district is that when the administrative record is unnecessary \nto evaluate the motion to dismiss, courts will waive compliance with this Local Rule 7(n)’s \nrequirements); Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of Minn. v. Zinke¸ 264 F. Supp. 3d 116, 123 n.12 \n(D.D.C. 2017) (same); PETA v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 59 F. Supp. 3d 91, 94 n.2 (D.D.C. \n2014) (granting agency’s motion for relief from Local Rule 7(n)’s requirements). \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, Defendants request to be excused from the requirement to file a certified \nindices  for  the  certified  administrative  records  pending  a  ruling  on  Defendants’  Motion  to \nDismiss.1 \nDated:  April 21, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \nEDWARD R.

We would like to underscore the lifesaving nature of the services provided through the \nReception and Placement (R&P) program, including the provision of housing support, \nemergency food assistance, and emergency medical care to newly arrived refugees and Special \nImmigrant Visa (SIV) holders who have been processed and approved for resettlement in the \nUnited States by the federal government. The R&P program is also consistent with the \nAdministration’s goals to make the United States safer and stronger, as it operates domestically \nto ensure that newly arrived refugees and SIV holders are able to integrate successfully into \nlocal communities. \nBased on our understanding of our R&P awards, we do not consider meeting present \nobligations to provide assistance to refugees and SIV holders already lawfully admitted to the \nUnited States to represent “new costs”, as referenced in the Notice. Consistent with the terms of \nour awards, for those refugees and SIV holders in their initial 90-day R&P service periods, we \nintend to seek reimbursement for all costs associated with serving these beneficiaries, per the \nNotice of Suspension’s language regarding payment requests for “for legitimate expenses \nincurred prior to the date of this Notice of Suspension or legitimate expenses associated with \nthis Notice of Suspension.” Please advise immediately if your direction is inconsistent with this \nunderstanding.  \nWe also have the following questions related to the Notice of Suspension:  \n(cid:120) As stated in the Executive Order on “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign \nAid”, the Secretary of State may waive the pause discussed in Section 3(a) of the \nExecutive Order for specific programs.

USCCB continues to press all the arguments in its memorandum in support of \nits motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. \nARGUMENT \nI.  USCCB Is Suffering Irreparable Harm From The Refugee Funding Suspension \nAn irreparable harm is an injury that is (1) “certain and great”; and (2) “beyond remedia-\ntion” through the sorts of “compensatory or other corrective relief” that a court is capable of grant-\ning “in the ordinary course of litigation.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 \nF.3d 290, 297–98 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  The second factor asks whether the plaintiff’s injury is judi-\ncially “redressable” after litigation concludes, regardless of whether the plaintiff might someday \nreturn to its prior position through its own efforts.  Id. at 298; see Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, \n408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d Cir. 2005) (injury is irreparable when it “cannot be remedied ‘if a court \nwaits until the end of trial to resolve the harm’”).  The answer here is no.  The government’s abrupt \nfunding suspension—while USCCB was actively providing services to already-arrived refugees—\nis inflicting on USCCB three ongoing irreparable harms that cannot be redressed by post hoc com-\npensatory relief: (1) the loss of staff expertise and experience; (2) injury to USCCB’s goodwill and \nrelationships with its partners; and (3) damage to USCCB’s refugee programs in frustration of one \nof its core missions.  \n \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 7 of 21\nFirst, losing employees with valuable expertise and relationships is irreparable harm to an \norganization; a court’s “‘compensatory or other corrective relief’” cannot restore its lost human \ncapital.  England, 454 F.3d at 297.  As the Fifth Circuit has explained, the “loss of an employee \nand the associated costs—monetary and otherwise—are nonrecoverable costs”:  Even if “a new \nemployee [is] hired” to replace the one lost, plaintiffs “would be harmed and would have no re-\ncourse for this harm.”  Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th 1017, 1034 (5th Cir. 2022).  Similarly, the \nEleventh Circuit recently held that an organization experiences irreparable injury that “cannot be \nundone through monetary remedies” when it loses “skilled employees” with the “institutional \nknowledge and experience” to fulfill “government contracts.”  Yorktown Sys. Grp., Inc. v. Threat \nTec LLC, 108 F.4th 1287, 1296 (11th Cir. 2024).  This makes sense because an organization’s \ncapabilities and expertise are diminished when it is forced to lay off experienced employees, even \nif it eventually replaces them.  And that is so regardless of whether the layoff irreparably harms \nthe employees.\n \nThe Refugee Funding Suspension has forced USCCB to notice terminations for 50 staff \nmembers with decades of accumulated experience providing refugee services in partnership with \nthe government, with more layoffs around the corner if the suspension continues.  Canny Decl. \n¶ 17.  The first of these terminations will become effective on March 7, at which point USCCB \nwill lose 27 employees.  Fuller Decl. ¶ 11.  USCCB will imminently lose the staff and their “insti-\ntutional knowledge and experience” that it needs to serve refugees through its cooperative agree-\nments, which the government might restart at any point in the future.  Yorktown, 108 F.4th at 1296; \nsee also Fuller Decl. ¶ 11 (explaining the expertise USCCB will lose).  This contrasts sharply with \npast fluctuations in program size, through which “USCCB was also able to retain the required \ninstitutional knowledge and expertise of its employees for the program to continue.”  Second \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 8 of 21\nCanny Decl. ¶ 4.  “Previously, when USCCB reduced the size of its refugee services staff in re-\nsponse to changing needs, it had much more time to carry out those reductions,” and “[d]uring that \ntime, USCCB could preserve institutional expertise by ensuring that departing staff members trans-\nferred their knowledge and partner contacts to remaining staff before leaving for new roles.”  Id. \n¶ 5.  But the “rapid, forced layoffs that USCCB is now experiencing” have “made similar efforts \ntoday nearly impossible” and will therefore “damage its institutional knowledge and relationships \nin a categorically more severe way.”  Id.  Compensatory relief cannot undo this injury even if it \nenables USCCB to hire “new employee[s]” in the future.  Louisiana, 55 F.4th at 1034. \nNor does the possibility that USCCB might eventually have to lay off employees due to \nthe Administration’s suspension of refugee admissions negate the irreparable harm being caused \nby the Refugee Funding Suspension.  To begin, it is speculative whether the Administration will \npermanently stop admitting all the refugees who would become part of USCCB’s programs.  And \nthe mere possibility that an organization would suffer a similar harm anyway does not make the \ncurrent injury any less “certain and great” and “beyond remediation” through compensatory relief.  \nEngland, 454 F.3d at 297.  In other words, USCCB is suffering an irreparable injury now regardless \nof what else might happen in the future.  But regardless, as already discussed, even if refugee-\nadmissions reductions would cause future layoffs, the sudden nature of the layoffs forced by the \nfunding suspension has exacerbated the damage to USCCB’s institutional knowledge. \nSecond, organizations suffer irreparable harm when a defendant damages their reputation, \ngoodwill, and relationships with their partners.  Because “‘[i]njury to reputation and goodwill is \nnot easily measured in monetary terms,’ it is ‘often viewed as irreparable.’”  Jones v. District of \nColumbia, 177 F. Supp. 3d 542, 547 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., \nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (3d ed. 2013 & 2015 Supp.)); see also Armour & Co. v. \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 9 of 21\nFreeman, 304 F.2d 404, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1962) (irreparable injury where government action “could \nnot fail to damage [the plaintiff’s] good name”); Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., \n963 F. Supp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (“irreparable harm in damage to [plaintiffs’] business reputation”).   \nSimilarly, damage to an organization’s relationships with its customers or partners is irrep-\narable.  For example, the Eleventh Circuit recently found irreparable harm when the “[a]brupt \ntermination” of an organization’s work “harm[ed] its reputation” and impeded its ability to fulfill \n“government contracts in the future.”  Yorktown, 108 F.4th at 1297; see also, e.g., Otero Sav. & \nLoan Ass’n v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 665 F.2d 275, 278 (10th Cir. 1981) (irreparable \nharm where plaintiff was “forced to interrupt services,” resulting in “severe confusion” and “loss \nof good will and customer confidence” (quotation marks omitted)); Express One Int’l, Inc. v. U.S. \nPostal Serv., 814 F. Supp. 87, 90–91 (D.D.C. 1992) (same where contractor would incur “signifi-\ncant lay-off, capital, and facility costs” and be “particularly hurt” by the “loss of” its “relationship \nwith its primary subcontractor”).      \nThe Refugee Funding Suspension is damaging USCCB’s goodwill and relationships with \nits partners—local charities who provide direct services to refugees in reliance on USCCB’s fund-\ning.  It has prevented USCCB from reimbursing $10.4 million (and growing) in costs incurred by \nits partners, who in turn have needed to lay off their own employees.1  Canny Decl. ¶ 16; Fuller \nDecl. ¶ 9 (revised sum).  Commonwealth Catholic Charities, for example, has $497,000 of unre-\nimbursed expenses, has depleted its cash reserves, and has needed to lay off 26 employees—de-\nspite still having 231 refugees in its resettlement program.  Brown Decl. ¶¶ 5–7.  Similarly, Cath-\nolic Charities of Central and Northern Missouri, which had about 500 refugees in its program on \n \n1 Previous filings tallied this number at $11.6 million.  In the interim, USCCB realized that it had \nmiscalculated this figure based on duplicated invoices.   \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 10 of 21\nJanuary 24, needed to lay off half its staff.  Main Decl. ¶¶ 5–6.  Catholic Charities of the Archdi-\nocese of Galveston-Houston likewise has dismissed 130 employees, requiring it to cut resettlement \nservices to a bare minimum.  Colbert Decl. ¶¶ 6–7.   \nAll these partners have declared that despite their desire to keep helping refugees, the seri-\nous risk of future funding shortfalls makes it unlikely they will work with USCCB again: \n  “If we cannot rely on funding for the programs the intermediary offers, we cannot justify \njoining those [USCCB] programs.”  Brown Decl. ¶ 11. \n  “[T]his unfortunate experience will make us incredibly reluctant to engage with [USCCB] \nin government-sponsored programs again.”  Main Decl. ¶ 9.   \n  “[G]iven the ongoing funding uncertainty, . . . [w]e do not anticipate taking on any more \nrefugees referred to us by USCCB as part of government-sponsored resettlement pro-\ngrams.”  Colbert Decl. ¶ 10. \nAnd in the case of Catholic Charities of Central and Northern Missouri, the suspension has fore-\nclosed any future partnership with USCCB to help refugees resettle in that area because it has \ndecided to wind down its refugee resettlement arm altogether: \n  “With heavy hearts, and despite CCNMO’s passion for serving our refugee brothers and \nsisters, we have begun the process of permanently closing our refugee resettlement pro-\ngram. . . . We cannot risk the more stable programs that we can continue to administer \nindependent of government assistance to keep the refugee resettlement program running \nduring periods of government recalcitrance.”  Main Decl. ¶ 8.   \nThe ongoing damage to USCCB’s partnerships caused by the “[a]brupt termination” of \nfunding will significantly impair USCCB’s ability to fulfill “government [cooperative agreements] \nin the future.”  Yorktown, 108 F.4th at 1297; Bishop Seitz Decl. ¶ 9.  This damage to USCCB’s \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 11 of 21\npartnerships is unique to the Refugee Funding Suspension, as past orderly wind-downs did not \nprevent subrecipients from working with USCCB again when refugee resettlement scaled back up.  \nSecond Canny Decl. ¶ 4.  In the past, the “winding down was gradual” and “federal funding for \nthe program was never interrupted,” so partners were able to “provide the full gamut of services \nas provided for in the cooperative agreements” without going unpaid for work done.  Id.  Not so \ntoday, as USCCB’s partners go unreimbursed for work already performed.  Retroactive monetary \nrelief cannot restore USCCB’s partners’ willingness to work with it on refugee resettlement.  If \nthe government decides to lift the suspension after this structural damage to USCCB’s network \nand infrastructure is already done, USCCB will not be able to provide for the more than 27,000 \nrefugees it was allocated by the government for FY2025.  Id. ¶ 5.   \nThird, an organization is irreparably harmed if: (1) the actions taken by the defendant have \n“perceptibly impaired the organization’s programs,” and (2) the defendant’s actions “directly con-\nflict with the organization’s mission.”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).  In other words, a defendant’s actions \nmust make “the organization’s activities more difficult,” in frustration of one of the organization’s \nbona fide missions.  Id.; see also Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(irreparable harm based on “ongoing harms to . . . organizational missions”); New York v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 61, 86 (2d Cir. 2020) (the “perceptible impairment” of an \norganization’s “activities” suffices for irreparable harm).       \nThe Refugee Funding Suspension has (to say the least) “perceptibly impaired” USCCB’s \n“programs” and frustrated one of its core “mission[s].”  Newby, 838 F.3d at 8.  Massive layoffs \nand permanent damage to crucial partner relationships make it vastly more difficult for USCCB to \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 12 of 21\nprovide refugee-resettlement assistance, now and in the future.  USCCB’s “operational and invest-\nment reserves cannot sustain” the drain caused by the Refugee Funding Suspension “without jeop-\nardizing the entire operation of the USCCB.”  Fuller Decl. ¶ 10.  And USCCB is “headed towards \na potential 100% reduction” in its “capacity . . . to properly resettle refugees.”  Second Canny Decl. \n¶ 5.   \nEven more disheartening, however, is the fact that the funding suspension now has forced \nUSCCB and its subrecipients to stop providing services to refugees in their care: \n  Commonwealth Catholic Charities is “no longer able to guarantee financial assistance \nrequests from” refugees in the program, “many [of whom] are on the brink of losing their \nnew homes.”  Brown Decl. ¶ 7.   \n  Catholic Charities of Central and Northern Missouri has had to stop providing all services \nto 250 refugees still within their initial 90-day resettlement period.  Main Decl. ¶ 5.   \n  Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston’s “ability to serve these ref-\nugees is already severely curtailed and will continue to decrease.”  Colbert Decl. ¶ 6.   \nAs a result, refugees in USCCB’s programs today are no longer receiving services, in contraven-\ntion of the terms of USCCB’s cooperative agreements—not to mention the government’s statutory \nobligation to assist recent arrivals.  In other words, USCCB can no longer implement its resettle-\nment programs with respect to a significant number of refugees.  Those programs are at the very \nleast “perceptibly impaired.”  Newby, 838 F.3d at 8.   \nUSCCB is thereby suffering “ongoing harms” to one of its core “organizational missions.” \nValle del Sol Inc., 732 F.3d at 1029.  The Church, “from her origin . . . has been intrinsically linked \nto the plight of refugees”; as such, the “Church’s accompaniment of refugees dates back to the \nearliest days of Christianity.”  Bishop Seitz Decl. ¶ 6.  Further, “the Gospel compels the Church \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 13 of 21\nto act in service of the poor and vulnerable.”  Id. ¶ 7.  USCCB’s “refugee resettlement efforts are \nan expression of the Gospel’s mandates to ‘love thy neighbor’ and ‘welcome the stranger,’ and are \ncore to its mission to organize and conduct the religious, charitable and social welfare work of the \nCatholic Church in the United States.”  Id. ¶ 8; accord Fuller Decl. ¶ 5.  “It is because of these \ndeeply held religious beliefs that, consistent with the work of the Church since its inception, the \nUSCCB runs the largest refugee resettlement agency in the United States.”  Bishop Seitz Decl. ¶ 7.  \nThat this work is core to USCCB’s mission is evident from the fact that nearly a third of its staff \nand operations are dedicated to refugee resettlement.  Fuller Decl. ¶ 6. \nNo amount of money awarded in the future can retroactively redress the fact that the fund-\ning suspension is preventing USCCB from fulfilling its mission to assist thousands of refugees \ncurrently in its care.  That forced failure is irreparable.  USCCB has a deeply held religious mission \nto implement the Gospel by helping refugees in their initial resettlement periods.  See Bishop Seitz \nDecl. ¶¶ 4–8.  The government is preventing it from doing so, and compensatory relief months or \nyears from now would not enable USCCB to go back in time and help the refugees that it felt \ncalled to help.  Cf. Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 19 (2020) \n(Church’s inability to conduct worship services, “for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably \nconstitutes irreparable injury.” (quotation marks omitted)).  Similarly, USCCB’s layoffs and dam-\nage to its partner-charity relationships also are irreparable injuries to its religious mission.  They \nfrustrate USCCB’s ability to care for refugees today and make it vastly more difficult for USCCB \nto do so in the future.  See Alpine Sec. Corp. v. FINRA, 121 F.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(finding irreparable harm where the “crushing consequences” for an organization’s “operations” \nmade it unrealistic to expect that it “could simply reopen its doors” later); accord Bishop Seitz \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 14 of 21\nDecl. ¶ 8 (“[T]he funding suspension threatens the USCCB’s ability to exercise its moral obliga-\ntion to provide for the particular refugees currently assigned to its care.”).  These irreparable harms \nare growing every day.   \nWhile caring for refugees is one of USCCB’s core missions, USCCB need not establish \nthat this is its only or primary mission.  Although the D.C. Circuit in Newby mentioned the organ-\nization’s “mission”—singular—it nowhere stated that only frustration of an organization’s sole or \nprimary mission constitutes irreparable harm, or that damage to just one of multiple organizational \nmissions would not.  Nor would such a rule make sense.  Whether damage to an organization’s \nmission is “certain and great” and not retroactively “redressable,” England, 454 F.3d at 297–98, \nin no way depends on whether the organization has one mission or multiple:  In either case, a \nmission-driven organization’s inability to carry out a mission for a period of time cannot be rem-\nedied with money damages.   \nMoreover, Newby explained that the purpose of the “mission” requirement is “to ensure \nthat organizations cannot engage in activities simply to create an injury.”  838 F.3d at 8.  That \npurpose is satisfied so long as the mission being impaired is at least one of the organization’s pre-\nexisting, bona fide missions.  Conversely, a “primary mission” requirement would leave courts \nguessing about where to draw the line between an organization’s primary and secondary missions.  \nThus, other courts of appeals have recognized that irreparable harm can be based on “ongoing \nharms to [the plaintiff’s] organizational missions.”  Valle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1029 (emphasis \nadded); see also E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 677–78 (9th Cir. 2021) (ir-\nreparable harm where organizations “established that they will suffer a significant change in their \nprograms” frustrating their “organizational missions”); New York, 969 F.3d at 62–63 (same where \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 15 of 21\norganizations  showed  “‘perceptible  impairment’  of  [their]  activities,”  and  their  interest \n“stem[med] from their assorted missions to increase non-citizen well-being and status”).     \nII.  The Balance Of The Equities And Public Interest Favor Relief \nIn addition to the arguments in USCCB’s opening brief—including that: (1) there is “no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action,” Newby, 838 F.3d at 12; (2) the \nRefugee Act declared that refugee assistance is the “historic policy of the United States,” Pub. L. \nNo. 96-212, § 101, 94 Stat. 102, 102 (1980); and (3) it is unfair for the government to suspend \nfunding for refugees already placed in USCCB’s care—the ongoing harm to refugees weighs heav-\nily in favor of relief.  It is now clear that refugees have stopped receiving essential services as a \nresult of the suspension—including assistance with food and housing costs, English training, and \njob placement.  Main Decl. ¶ 5.  Vulnerable refugees whom the government brought to this country \nare now at imminent risk of losing their homes, if they have not done so already.  Brown Decl. ¶ 7.  \nIt serves no one—and no conceivable governmental policy interest—for refugees already in the \nUnited States to lose their homes, English instruction, and job training instead of being integrated \ninto American society.  \nIII.  USCCB Is Likely To Succeed On The Merits \nA.  The Government Has Withheld Allowable Costs In Violation Of Section \n200.305 \nThe government’s refusal to reimburse USCCB’s expenses pursuant to its cooperative \nagreements is arbitrary and capricious because it violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6)—an OMB reg-\nulation governing federal grants that the State Department has incorporated into its own regula-\ntions, see 2 C.F.R. § 600.101.  Section 200.305(b)(6) provides that “[p]ayments for allowable costs \nmust not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless required by Federal \nstatute, regulations, or” if the recipient has “failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 16 of 21\nFederal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United States.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) (em-\nphasis added).  The government has not suggested that the suspension is required by a federal \nstatute or regulation, or that USCCB violated the terms of its award or is delinquent in a debt.  Nor \nis there any dispute that the reimbursement requests USCCB has submitted are for “allowable \ncosts” under the terms of its agreements, or that USCCB remains within the agreements’ “period[s] \nof performance”—which run until September 30, 2025. \nYet the government nevertheless has impermissibly “withheld” payment for allowable \ncosts by refusing—through its Refugee Funding Suspension—to process USCCB’s reimburse-\nment requests in the ordinary course.  The term “withheld” carries its ordinary meaning based on \n“common English usage” because there is no relevant regulatory definition.  In re Polar Bear \nEndangered Species Act Listing, 709 F.3d 1, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2013); see Rumsfeld v. United Tech. \nGrp., 315 F.3d 1361, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (turning to “standard dictionary definitions” where \nterm was undefined); Glycine & More, Inc. v. United States, 880 F.3d 1335, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \n“Withhold” means “to refrain from granting,” “to keep in custody,” or to “hold back.”  Webster’s \nNew World College Dictionary (5th ed. 2014); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th \ned. 2014).  Since January 24, the government has refrained from granting, kept in custody, and \nheld back reimbursement payments for costs USCCB incurred pursuant to its cooperative agree-\nments.  It has therefore “withheld” payments.   \nThe purportedly temporary nature of the funding suspension does not alter that conclusion.  \nSection 200.305(b)(6) provides that allowable costs “must not be withheld at any time”; it makes \nno exception for temporary withholdings.  And it is perfectly natural to use the word “withhold” \nto describe a temporary suspension:  A court of appeals, for example, might withhold issuance of \nthe mandate until a rehearing poll is completed; or a homeowner might withhold a contractor’s \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 17 of 21\npayment until the work is done.  So too here with the government’s purportedly temporary with-\nholding of payments.  That does not mean that every de minimis, ordinary-course processing delay \nviolates Section 200.305(b)(6).  But where, as here, the government expressly and intentionally \nstops payment for a significant period of time—as it has done here through a suspension letter and \na tacit refusal to reimburse pre-January 24 expenses—it has unquestionably “withheld” payment.2   \nB.  The Government Has Imposed An Unlawful Suspension, Not A Permissible \nTermination \nNothing in USCCB’s cooperative agreements or applicable federal regulations allows the \ngovernment’s funding suspension.  The agreements incorporate the termination provisions of 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340, which allows the agency to “terminate[]” an award “to the extent authorized by \nlaw,  if  an  award  no  longer  effectuates  the  program  goals  or  agency  priorities.”    2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4).  But the government has not purported to terminate USCCB’s agreements pursu-\nant to this provision; the suspension letter purports to “suspend[]” the award because it “may no \nlonger effectuate agency priorities,” and says that a decision “whether to continue, modify, or \nterminate award(s) will be made following this review.”  Mot. TRO, Ex. C, at 2 (emphasis added).   \nNor could the government have terminated USCCB’s awards on January 24, for at least \nthree reasons: (1) The government had not (and still has not) determined that they “no longer \neffectuat[e]  the  program  goals  or  agency  priorities,”  § 200.340(a)(4);  (2)  under  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.341(a), the government “must provide written notice of termination to the recipient” includ-\ning “the reasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be \nterminated, if applicable”—which it has not; and (3) 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a) requires the Department \n \n2 Although the government has not expressly stated that it is refusing to reimburse pre-January 24 \nexpenses, the fact that it has not reimbursed USCCB for these expenses for more than a month—\nin light of the usual processing time of 24 to 48 hours—is powerful evidence that the government \nhas intentionally “withheld” payment.  \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 18 of 21\nto provide employment and English training to already-arrived refugees, so termination would not \nbe “authorized by law” as required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).    \nRather than terminating the agreement, the government did exactly what it said:  It unilat-\nerally suspended funding for the agreements without terminating them.  In other words, USCCB’s \ncooperative agreements remain in effect—refugees who have already arrived are still in USCCB’s \nprograms and are owed assistance—but the government has simply stopped paying.   \nNothing in the agreements or regulations permits this funding suspension.  Federal regula-\ntions differentiate between “termination” and “suspension.”  “Termination” is when an agency \n“discontinue[s] a Federal award . . . before the planned end date of the period of performance,” \n2 C.F.R. § 200.1, and, as explained, it is governed by 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340 and 200.341.  The reg-\nulations  do  not  expressly  define  what  counts  as  a  “suspension”  of  award  payments,  but \n2 C.F.R. § 200.339 makes clear that it means something different.  It provides that as a remedy for \n“noncompliance” with federal law or the award’s terms and conditions, an agency may “[s]uspend \nor terminate” the award.  2 C.F.R. § 200.339(c) (emphasis added).  Sometimes the government \ndoes include broader suspension clauses in its contracts and agreements.  See, e.g., FAR § 52.242-\n14 (“Suspension of Work” clause that the government inserts into certain construction contracts \nallowing it to order a contractor “to suspend . . . all or any part of the work . . . for the convenience \nof the Government”); id. § 52.242-15 (optional contract provision allowing “stop-work order[s]”).   \nBut USCCB’s agreements just echo 2 C.F.R. § 200.339.  See Mot. TRO, Ex. A, at 81 (the govern-\nment may “suspend[]” USCCB’s award for noncompliance with federal law or the award’s terms).  \nAnd the government has not alleged that USCCB has been noncompliant in any way.3     \n \n3 A suspension of funding for noncompliance under 2 C.F.R. § 200.339(c) likely would be a per-\nmissible withholding under 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6), which allows payments to be “withheld” \n(Cont’d on next page) \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 19 of 21\nThus, if the government wanted to stop funding USCCB’s agreements for policy reasons, \nit needed to comply with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340 and 200.341’s requirements for termination.  It did \nnot.  Instead, it suspended funding based on a potential policy disagreement.  That was unlawful.  \nC.  This Is A Heartland APA Case, Not A Tucker Act Case \nUSCCB seeks a preliminary injunction ordering the government to stop enforcing its un-\nlawful suspension and to resume reimbursements pursuant to USCCB’s cooperative agreements \nand federal law.  As the Supreme Court explained in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 \n(1988), that is a request for specific equitable relief cognizable in this Court under the APA, not \nthe Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. \nFirst, USCCB has a cause of action under the APA because it is “suffering legal wrong” \nand has been “adversely affected” by “agency action”—namely, the State Department’s suspen-\nsion of funding under USCCB’s cooperative agreements.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  USCCB thus “is enti-\ntled to judicial review thereof” under the APA.  Id.; see Bowen, 487 U.S. at 892.     \nSecond, USCCB’s suit is not one for “money damages” that would be excluded from the \nAPA’s cause of action and waiver of sovereign immunity.  5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704.  Bowen held that \nactions seeking “declaratory and injunctive relief” are “certainly not actions for money damages.”  \n487 U.S. at 893.  The plaintiffs in Bowen wanted the government to reimburse them for expendi-\ntures under the Medicaid program.  Id. at 882.  But the “fact that a judicial remedy may require \none party to pay money to another [was] not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money \ndamages.’”  Id. at 893.  The Court distinguished between money damages, which “are given to the \n \nwhen “required by Federal statute, regulations, or” if the recipient “has failed to comply with the \nterms and conditions of the federal award.” \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 20 of 21\nplaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss,” and “specific remedies,” which are “not substitute rem-\nedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.”  Id. at 895 \n(quotation marks omitted).  When the plaintiff seeks “funds to which a statute allegedly entitles \nit,” that is a request for “specific relief” in the same way that a request for “in-kind benefits” \nmandated by federal law would be specific relief rather than “money damages.”  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Thus, plaintiffs’ APA suit to set aside the agency’s denial of reimbursement and \nenforce payment requirements under federal law was cognizable in district court.  Id. at 909–11. \nSo too here.  Like the Bowen plaintiffs, USCCB seeks to set aside unlawful agency action \ndenying “reimbursement”—which is not a request for a “money judgment”—and the preliminary \ninjunction USCCB requests is “specific relief,” not “money damages.”  487 U.S. at 909–10.  As \nin Bowen, USCCB has not asked for a monetary award; it has asked the government to comply \nwith federal law and the terms of its cooperative agreements by resuming the processing of reim-\nbursement requests in the same way and on a similar timeline as it always has.   \nThird, the Tucker Act does not displace the APA’s cause of action because the Court of \nFederal Claims is not an adequate alternative forum for USCCB’s claim.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  As \nBowen explained, the Court of Federal Claims “does not have the general equitable powers of a \ndistrict court to grant prospective” or “equitable relief.”  487 U.S. at 905.  It cannot grant equitable \nrelief unless it is “‘an incident of and collateral to’ a money judgment,” James v. Caldera, 159 \nF.3d 573, 580 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2))—for instance, ordering “restora-\ntion to office or position,” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2).  And the Federal Circuit has applied Bowen to \nhold that a request that an agency properly calculate and pay contract rents was not a suit for money \ndamages, but “equitable relief” within the district court’s jurisdiction.  Katz v. Cisneros, 16 F.3d \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 22     Filed 02/24/25     Page 21 of 21\n1204, 1208–09 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (plaintiff “seeks payments to which it alleges it is entitled pursuant \nto federal statute and regulations; it does not seek money as compensation for a loss suffered”).   \nGiven the relief USCCB is requesting, the Court of Federal Claims would decline jurisdic-\ntion over this case, see Katz, 16 F.3d at 1207–09, and USCCB would not be able to obtain the \npreliminary injunction it needs to prevent ongoing irreparable harm, see Sergent’s Mechanical \nSys., Inc. v. United States, 157 Fed. Cl. 41, 48 (2021) (“a preliminary injunction, by definition, \ncannot be ‘incident of and collateral to’ a final money judgment”).     \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant USCCB’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nFebruary 24, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ David W.

Mot. Prelim. Inj., \nECF No. 30.   The Court denied the motion, finding that the Tucker Act divested it of \njurisdiction to grant the requested relief.  Mem. Order, ECF No. 37.  The Conference filed an \ninterlocutory appeal and now moves for an emergency injunction pending appeal.  Mot. Inj. \nPending Appeal, ECF 40.   \nIn some rare cases, a court may grant an injunction pending appeal “even if [it] just \ndenied injunctive relief [and] believes its analysis in denying relief is correct.”  United States v. \nFacebook, No. 19-cv-2184, 2024 WL 291739, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 2024) (cleaned up).  The \nanalysis turns on the same four factors applicable to preliminary injunctions.  Id.  Courts evaluate \nthe factors under a “sliding scale” approach where a “strong showing on one factor [can] make \nup for a weaker showing on another.”  Cigar Ass’n of Am. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 317 F. \nSupp. 3d 555, 560 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. \n2011)); but see League of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 41     Filed 03/14/25     Page 2 of 2\n(acknowledging uncertainty on whether the sliding scale approach is still good law).  Thus, even \nif a movant has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits, an injunction pending appeal \nmay still be warranted if “the other three factors tip sharply” in the movant’s favor.  Facebook, \n2024 WL 291739, at *1 (cleaned up). \nBut whether the Conference meets that standard or not, the injunction it seeks remains \nbeyond this Court’s reach.  The impediment is jurisdictional.  No amount of give-and-take \nbetween the four factors can change that.  As explained in the initial preliminary injunction \ndenial, “this Court cannot offer the requested relief” because the Tucker Act divests it of \njurisdiction over contractual remedies.  Mem. Order at 1.  That limitation applies with equal \nforce here as well. \nFor these reasons, it is \nORDERED that Plaintiff’s [40] Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal is \nDENIED. \nSO ORDERED. \n   \n           \nDated: March 14, 2025        TREVOR N.

U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 317 F. Supp. 3d 555, 560 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  “Of course, \nby its own terms,” Rule 62(d) “necessarily envisions situations in which a district court that has \ndenied an injunction still grants an injunction pending appeal”—“even if the court that just denied \ninjunctive relief ‘believe[s] its analysis’ in denying relief ‘is correct.’”  United States v. Facebook, \n2024 WL 291739, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 2024) (alteration in original) (quoting Wash. Metro. Area \nTransit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844–45 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).  Thus, when the \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 40     Filed 03/13/25     Page 2 of 2\n“threat of irreparable harm” is “grave” and balance of the equities “decisively” favors relief, an \ninjunction pending appeal “may be proper” if the movant “establishes a ‘serious legal question’ on \nthe merits and shows that ‘the other three factors tip sharply’ in its favor.”  Id. (citations omitted).   \nThis Court should grant a motion for injunction pending appeal because USCCB has, at a \nminimum, raised serious legal issues on the merits for the reasons explained in its prior briefing.  \nECF Nos. 5, 22, 28, 30, 36.  In addition, USCCB continues to suffer grave irreparable harm to its \nfaith-based mission, and the equities in this case tip sharply in its favor, as USCCB has also ex-\nplained.  See, e.g., ECF No. 30-2 at 10.  Further, this Court should not require USCCB, a nonprofit, \nreligious organization seeking to vindicate important public rights, to post a bond, as doing so \nwould undermine its right to judicial review.

The Termination also is \ncausing irreparable injury to USCCB, frustrating the Conference’s mission to assist refugees as-\nsigned to it.  And the balance of equities and public interest weigh in favor of allowing USCCB’s \nresettlement programs to continue as long as refugees remain in their 90-day resettlement win-\ndows.  For these reasons, and those in USCCB’s earlier briefing, which USCCB adopts, this Court \nshould preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction to Set Aside and Enjoin The Termination \nThis Court has jurisdiction to set aside the unlawful Termination and enjoin the govern-\nment.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 703, 705, 706; Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, \n327 (2015) (court may enjoin “violations of federal law by federal officials”); Cobell v. Norton, \n240 F.3d 1081, 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (similar).  That jurisdiction is not limited by the APA.  Re-\nquests for “specific relief, albeit monetary, are for relief other than money damages and therefore \nwithin the waiver of sovereign immunity in section 702.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, \n900 (1988) (quoting Md. Dep’t of Human Res. v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 763 F.2d \n1441, 1447–48 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  Thus, the APA waives the United States’ sovereign immunity. \nThe Tucker Act neither provides an “adequate remedy,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, nor “expressly or \nimpliedly forbids the relief which is sought,” 5 U.S.C. § 702.  Jurisdiction “depends not simply on \nwhether a case involves contract issues, but on whether, despite the presence of a contract, plain-\ntiffs’ claims are founded only on a contract, or whether they stem from a statute or the Constitu-\ntion.”  Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992) \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 7 of 16\n(emphasis added).  The D.C. Circuit looks to three considerations—on a claim-by-claim basis—\nto determine if a claim in district court is barred by the Tucker Act.  A claim is barred only if both \nthe nature of the claim is contractual, and the relief sought is contractual.  Crowley Gov. Servs., \nInc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1106–07 & n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  And, the D.C. Circuit \nhas “categorically reject[ed] the suggestion that a federal district court can be deprived of jurisdic-\ntion by the Tucker Act when no jurisdiction lies in the Court of Federal Claims.”  Tootle v. Sec’y \nof the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 176 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Here, each favors district court jurisdiction. \nFirst, USCCB’s claims are grounded in regulatory and statutory duties—not contracts.  Lit-\nigants “may bring statutory and constitutional claims in federal district court even when the claims \ndepend on the existence and terms of a contract.”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610.  To resolve those \nclaims, the Court must interpret the Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1522, the Impoundment Control Act, \n2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq., and the Uniform Administrative Requirements, 2 C.F.R. § 200.305 et seq.  \nDetermining whether the government “exceeded its authority” or “violated” these various federal \nlaws “requires primarily an examination of the statutes” and regulations the government “has pur-\nportedly violated”; these are “not questions the district court can answer by examining a contrac-\ntual promise.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1108–09.1  USCCB’s claims thus resemble those repeatedly \nheld cognizable in district court.  See, e.g., Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1524 (D.C. Cir. \n1986) (“federal regulations, statutes and the Constitution”); Transohio, 967 F.2d at 611 (“statutory \nand due process claims”); Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1108 (“Transportation Act” and “Contract Disputes \nAct’s finality clause”).  Here, USCCB does not assert breach of obligations grounded solely in the \n \n1 The Court’s analysis of whether the termination is “authorized by law” would be identical with \nor without the cooperative agreements’ adoption of it.  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  If adoption of a \nregulation by reference rendered its violation a Tucker Act action, the government could evade the \nAPA simply by adopting statutory and regulatory regimes into its contracts. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 8 of 16\ncooperative agreements.  Contra Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits, 357 F.3d 62, 66–69 (D.C. \nCir. 2004) (breach of “section 7.1,” “section 10.2,” and “section 8.1(b) of the Board Plan”); Am. \nNear E. Refugee Aid v. U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev., 2023 WL 10669678, at *6 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, \n2023) (contesting “USAID’s execution or interpretation of the Cooperative Agreement”). \nSecond, USCCB seeks classic equitable remedies available in an administrative law action:  \nan order “hold[ing] unlawful and set[ting] aside agency action”—the suspension letter, termination \nletters, and policy suspending support for initial refugee resettlement—because those actions are \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” and exceed \n“statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  To be sure, USCCB’s suit may \nresult in an order compelling the government to provide payments as provided for in the agree-\nments, but “a federal district court may accept jurisdiction over a statutory or constitutional claim \nfor injunctive relief even where the relief sought is an order forcing the government to obey the \nterms of a contract.”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610; see also Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, \n971 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (rejecting view “that an agency action may not be enjoined, even if in clear \nviolation of a specific statute, simply because that same action might also amount to a breach of \ncontract”).  USCCB’s requested order also would confer “non-monetary relief” that has “‘consid-\nerable value’ independent of any future potential for monetary relief.”  Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army, \n56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  It would enable USCCB to continue its deeply-held mission \nto assist refugees—one of a “host of non-monetary benefits” including “perhaps most significantly, \nthe ability to provide services to [refugees] and perform its contractual obligations free of the” \ngovernment’s “alleged interference.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1111.  Any monetary consequences \n“will not come from the District Court’s exercise of jurisdiction, ‘but from the structure of statutory \nand regulatory requirements’” in the operation of the program.  Tootle, 446 F.3d at 175.   \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 9 of 16\nThird, this case must remain in district court because the Court of Federal Claims cannot \nprovide the relief most important for USCCB.  The “Claims Court cannot . . . order specific per-\nformance,” Transohio, 967 F.2d at 608, and cannot “grant prospective relief,” Bowen, 487 U.S. at \n905.  That is why the Federal Circuit has also agreed that a complaint that “unmistakably asks for \nprospective relief”—including “payments to which [the plaintiff] is entitled pursuant to federal \nstatute and regulations”—and turns on “the interpretation of a law that controls payment” is \nproperly in the district court’s jurisdiction.  Katz v. Cisneros, 16 F.3d 1204, 1208 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  \nWithout prompt equitable relief, any future award of money damages would not repair the ongoing \nand irreparable harm to USCCB’s mission as it is unable to care for the refugees already placed \nunder its care.  The suggestion that USCCB “could reframe its claim as one for damages and bring \nit in the Claims Court” is “no response” because it is “precisely the ‘restrictive and unprecedented \ninterpretation of § 704’ that the Supreme Court rejected” in Bowen.  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 608. \nII.  USCCB Is Likely To Succeed On The Merits \nA.  The Termination Violates the Refugee Act of 1980 \nThe Refugee Act of 1980 requires the government to provide resettlement services for ref-\nugees that the government chooses to admit into the United States.  Through the Refugee Funding \nSuspension and Termination, the government has violated that statutory command by cutting off \nfunding of initial-resettlement services for already-admitted refugees. \nIn the Refugee Act, Congress sought “to provide comprehensive and uniform provisions \nfor the effective resettlement and absorption of those refugees who are admitted.”  Pub. L. No. 96-\n212 § 101(b), 94 Stat. 102, 102 (1980).  To accomplish that objective, Congress required the gov-\nernment to provide resettlement services to admitted refugees.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).  Congress \nmandated that the government “shall” provide funding “to the extent of available appropriations” \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 10 of 16\nfor services like employment and English training such that refugees become self-sufficient “as \nquickly as possible.”  Id. § 1522(a)(1)(A).  Congress likewise directed that the government “shall \ndevelop and implement . . . policies and strategies for the placement and resettlement of refugees \nwithin the United States,” id. § 1522(a)(2)(B), and expressed its “intent” that “employable refugees \nshould be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival,” id. § 1522(a)(1)(B)(i).   \nAlthough Congress has made funding mandatory for refugee-resettlement programs, it has \ngiven the government discretion over how to fund the programs.  For the resettlement program at \nissue here—the “program of initial resettlement”—the government can provide funding through \none or more resettlement agencies, as it has done every year since the statute was enacted in \n1980.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b)(1).  Alternatively, the government has authority to carry out the program \nitself.  Id. § 1522(b)(2) (the government is “authorized to develop” and “implement” training and \neducation programs for resettling refugees).  And of course, the government also retains discretion \nwhether to admit refugees into the United States in the first place.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(1).  But \nCongress nowhere gave the government discretion to decline to spend available appropriations for \ninitial resettlement of refugees that the government has elected to admit into the United States. \nYet that is exactly what the government has done through the Refugee Funding Suspension \nand the Termination.  The government has ceased providing USCCB funding for the thousands of \nrefugees in USCCB’s care who are still within their period of initial resettlement.  And the gov-\nernment has offered no evidence (nor is USCCB aware of any) that the government is providing \nthat funding directly to refugees.  That funding cessation violates the Refugee Act. \n   The government has not denied that Section 1522(a) imposes mandatory resettlement-\nfunding obligations.  Instead, the government has suggested that those obligations do not apply to \nthe initial-resettlement program.  The government points out that Section 1522(b)(1)(A) gives the \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 11 of 16\ngovernment discretion whether to enter into cooperative agreements with agencies like USCCB.  \nOpp. 21.  But as discussed, that discretion is limited to deciding how to fund the initial-resettlement \nprogram—either directly or through private agencies.  The Refugee Act does not grant the gov-\nernment discretion to decide whether to provide funding at all.  To the contrary, the statute makes \nclear that Section 1522(a)’s funding obligations apply throughout Section 1522, including Sec-\ntion 1522(b).  Section 1522(a)’s first sentence provides that “under this section”—which includes \nSection 1522(b)—the government “shall” fund the specified resettlement services “to the extent \nof available appropriations.”  Id. § 1522(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added); accord id. § 1522(a)(1)(B) \n(“It is the intent of Congress that in providing refugee assistance under this section . . . .” (emphasis \nadded)).  Section 1522(b) further instructs that “[g]rants to, or contracts with, private nonprofit \nvoluntary agencies under this paragraph shall be made consistent with the objectives of this sub-\nchapter”—which includes Section 1522(a)’s commands.  Id. § 1522(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  \nSection 1522(a)’s requirements thus flow down to the initial-resettlement program.   \n   Contextual cues point to the same conclusion.  In the Refugee Act, Congress directed that \nthe President “shall provide for a study of which agency is best able to administer the program \nunder  this  paragraph  [§ 1522(b)(1)]  and  shall  report  . . .  to  the  Congress  on  such  study.”  \n§ 412(b)(1)(B), 94 Stat. at 113.  It would make no sense for that report to be mandatory if the \nprogram itself were not.  In addition, the government still has not explained why Congress would \nhave wanted to give the government unfettered discretion to decide whether to fund resettlement \npayment obligations only during a refugee’s first 90 days in the country—the most important part \nof a refugee’s transition to the United States.   \n   The government also contends that Section 1522(a)’s obligations do not carry through to \nthe initial-resettlement program because Section 1522(a) by its terms imposes obligations on the \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 12 of 16\nDirector of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, not the Secretary of State who currently carries \nout the initial-resettlement program.  Opp. 21.  But the Secretary of State stands in the Director’s \nshoes when implementing that program.  Under the Refugee Act, the Director would have admin-\nistered  the  initial-resettlement  program  starting  in  fiscal  year  1982.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1522(b)(1)(A)(ii).  Had that happened, the Director would have been subject to Section 1522(a)’s \nrequirements for the reasons already discussed.  The President’s designation of the Secretary of \nState to assume the Director’s role in 1981 did not vitiate those statutory obligations.  Instead, the \nRefugee Act makes clear that the Secretary stepped into the Director’s shoes:  “[T]he authority of \nthe Director under the first sentence of [§ 1522(b)(1)(A)] shall be exercised by such officer as the \nPresident shall from time to time specify.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b)(1)(B); see Letter from President \nCarter to Speaker of the House, 3 Public Papers of President Carter 2879 (Jan. 13, 1981); HIAS, \nInc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 319 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021).  Moreover, even if the Director somehow \nretained Section 1522(a)’s funding obligations, that would be immaterial in this case because the \nDirector and the Secretary of State are both defendants here.  If either of those parties has funding \nobligations under Section 1522(a), this Court can order them to comply with the statute.  \nFinally, USCCB has standing to enforce Section 1522(a).  USCCB is injured by the sus-\npension and termination of its programs.  That injury likely would be redressed by an order setting \naside the government’s actions and requiring the government to comply with its statutory obliga-\ntions.  Although the government might comply by providing services directly to refugees, it has \nnever done that and could not practically do so within the initial-resettlement period for the thou-\nsands of refugees in USCCB’s care.  Thus, the government almost certainly would respond to this \nCourt’s order by providing funding for the initial resettlement of these refugees to USCCB.  See \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (sufficient \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 13 of 16\nthat it is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision”).  And even if the government did provide services directly to refugees in USCCB’s \ncare, that would at least “effectuate a partial remedy” by reducing some of USCCB’s mission-\nbased and financial harms—“satisf[ying] the redressability requirement.”  Uzuegbunam v. Prec-\nzewski, 592 U.S. 279, 291 (2021) (quotation marks omitted).    \nB.  The Termination Violates the Impoundment Control Act \nThe Termination is an even clearer violation of the Impoundment Control Act than the \nsuspension.  While the suspension at least purported to be a temporary pause to evaluate USCCB’s \nagreements, the termination is a permanent refusal to spend funds on refugee assistance, based on \n“agency priorities.”  This permanent refusal to spend appropriated funds for resettlement assistance \nmandated by law is either a “withholding or delaying [of] the obligation or expenditure of budget \nauthority,” 2 U.S.C. § 682(1)(A) (a “deferral”), or “the termination of authorized projects or activ-\nities for which budget authority has been provided, 2 U.S.C. § 683(a) (a “rescission”).  In either \nevent, the termination violates the ICA:  It is either an unlawful policy-based deferral, see 2 U.S.C. \n§ 684(b); City of New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 901 (D.C. Cir. 1987), or an unauthor-\nized rescission for which no special message has been sent to Congress, 2 U.S.C. § 683. \nC.  The Termination Is Arbitrary and Capricious \nFirst, the government did not account for the serious consequences that it will have on \ngrantees like USCCB, subrecipients, and refugees—including irreparable damage to USCCB’s \nmission and to refugees who are losing essential services during the critical first months of their \nresettlement.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020).   \nSecond, the government’s lone rationale was inadequate.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  The Termination rested on \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 14 of 16\nthe bare assertion that the “award no longer effectuates agency priorities.”  But the government \ndid not explain why USCCB’s awards no longer effectuate its priorities—a glaring omission given \nthat it has continuously funded USCCB’s refugee programs for decades.  “[C]onclusory state-\nments” like these “do not meet the requirement that ‘the agency adequately explain its result.’”  \nDickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1407 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  By merely “parrot[ing] the lan-\nguage of” 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a) “without providing an account of how [the government] reached its \nresults,” the government “has not adequately explained the basis for its decision.”  Id. at 1405.   \nThird, the government violated its own regulations, rendering the Termination arbitrary \nand capricious.  Nat’l Envtl. Dev. Ass’n’s Clean Air Project v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 752 F.3d 999, \n1009 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Even if USCCB’s awards no longer effectuate “agency priorities,” they \ncould only be terminated “to the extent authorized by law.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  But as \nexplained above, the Termination independently violates the Refugee Act, ICA, and the APA’s \nreasoned-decisionmaking requirement.  So it also violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a).   \nIII.  The Termination Is Causing Irreparable Harm \nLike the Refugee Funding Suspension, the Termination is causing irreparable injury to \nUSCCB.  The most obvious injury is to USCCB’s mission.  No longer temporary, the Termination \nends the government funding that enables USCCB to fulfill one of its core missions.  There is no \ndispute that without the funds the government promised when it assigned refugees to USCCB, \nUSCCB will be unable to continue providing essential food, housing, and training to the thousands \nof recently arrived refugees in its care.  Every day that passes with the unlawful termination in \neffect is another day that USCCB is unable to fulfill its mission to follow the model of Jesus Christ \nand serve these poor and vulnerable neighbors.  Bishop Seitz Decl. ¶ 6.  As the D.C. Circuit and \nothers have recognized, a mission-driven organization’s inability to fulfill its mission for a period \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 15 of 16\nof time cannot be retroactively remedied with money damages.  See League of Women Voters of \nU.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2016); Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 \n(9th Cir. 2013); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 61, 86 (2d Cir. 2020).   \nThe recent preliminary injunction issued in Pacito does not obviate USCCB’s need for \nrelief.  That order enjoined the government from halting refugee admissions and withholding re-\nimbursements from refugee-resettlement organizations, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on their \nclaims under 8 U.S.C. § 1522 and the APA.  See Pacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-255-JNW, ECF \nNo. 45 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025).  But there is no indication that the government has begun to \nprocess USCCB’s reimbursement requests as a result of that order.  And USCCB is entitled to its \nown, narrow remedy in case the Pacito court’s order—which granted universal relief against both \nthe suspension of refugee admissions and resettlement funding—is stayed or narrowed.   \nIV.  The Balance Of The Equities And Public Interest Favor Relief \nThe equities and public interest favor enabling USCCB to keep helping the refugees the \ngovernment assigned to it.  No equities or public interest justifies depriving recently arrived refu-\ngees of essential services like food, medical, and housing assistance.  The President has no legiti-\nmate interest in implementing policies that contravene statutes.  Regardless, any frustration of the \nPresident’s policies would be trivial because the relief USCCB requests would continue its pro-\ngrams only until its remaining refugees finish their 90-day resettlement periods.  But make no \nmistake:  No one else is helping these thousands of recently arrived refugees, and the public interest \nis better served if those refugees, rather than going hungry and homeless, instead receive the Eng-\nlish-language and job training that would enable them to integrate into American society.   \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant USCCB’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 30-2     Filed 03/03/25     Page 16 of 16\nMarch 3, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ David W.

The State \nDepartment’s termination of the agreements underlying this dispute now plainly put this matter \ninto the realm of a contract dispute seeking more than $10,000, which falls within the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.   \nThat is, the termination of the agreements leaves open only a question of unpaid money \nunder the cooperative agreements, and, to the extent Plaintiff disputes any reimbursement, the \ndispute needs to brought in the Court of Federal Claims.  Even could the Court have entertained \ninjunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act to compel the State Department to take \nsome action under the agreements during their lifetimes, any such jurisdiction is now clearly absent \nas there is no action the Court could compel—the parties’ agreements are no longer in force.   \nRelatedly, Plaintiff can claim no irreparable harm absent an injunction as the only relief now \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 27     Filed 02/27/25     Page 2 of 5\navailable to Plaintiff is money damages should the parties be unable to resolve any payment \ndisputes through any available administrative channels.   \nDated: February 27, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \nWashington, DC \nEDWARD R.

For nearly 80 years, the Catholic Church has been caring for refugees within the \nUnited States.  Refugees face significant challenges upon entering the country, including locat-\ning housing, learning English, and finding employment.  The Church has long helped to ease \nthose burdens and integrate refugees into American society by providing shelter, clothing, food, \nand training.  This work is an expression of charity taken in fulfillment of Christ’s command-\nment to serve those in need, regardless of their race, creed, or color. \n2.  Since 1980, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and its predeces-\nsor organization, the U.S. Catholic Conference, (“USCCB” or the “Conference”) have expanded \nthat mission in partnership with the federal government through the U.S. Refugee Admissions \nProgram.  It “is the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons \nsubject to persecution in their homelands” by providing “transitional assistance to refugees in \nthe United States.”  Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, § 101, 94 Stat. 102, 102.  The \nfederal government carries out this transitional assistance through the Bureau of Population, \nRefugees, and Migration (“PRM”), which is a component of the Department of State.  USCCB \nhas partnered with the federal government in this work for nearly half a century, under admin-\nistrations of both parties and with the support of repeated and ongoing congressional appropri-\nations. \n3.  The beneficiaries of this cooperative partnership are refugees who are fleeing \npersecution, instability, and oppression and have come to the United States as a place of refuge \nand hope.  These refugees are vetted and approved by the federal government before entering \nthe country and now are in the United States legally.  Once here, they are entitled by statute to \nreceive federal funds for their initial period of resettlement—transitional support for no more \nthan their first 90 days in the United States, which is essential to helping them establish a new \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 3 of 35\nhome.  This transitional assistance promotes the successful settlement of refugees in their com-\nmunities, including by promoting gainful employment or connections to educational opportuni-\nties, thereby diminishing the likelihood that newly arriving refugees will be dependent on on-\ngoing public support. \n4.  PRM funds these refugee resettlement programs through annual cooperative \nagreements with organizations like USCCB.  Under USCCB’s current cooperative agreements, \nPRM has committed to provide around $65 million in federal funding for the immediate physical \nneeds and integration of refugees into their new communities.  In coordination with local Cath-\nolic Charities and other subrecipients, USCCB uses these funds to care for thousands of refugees \nin the United States.  USCCB and its subrecipients provide food, shelter, job training, and Eng-\nlish-language education in order to help refugees integrate and become self-sufficient as quickly \nas possible.  USCCB spends more on refugee resettlement each year than it receives in funding \nfrom the federal government, but it cannot sustain its programs without the millions in federal \nfunding  that  provide  the  foundation  of  this  private-public  partnership.    For  decades,  the \nU.S. government has chosen to admit refugees and outsourced its statutory responsibility to pro-\nvide those refugees with resettlement assistance to non-profit organizations like USCCB.  But \nnow, after refugees have already arrived and been placed in USCCB’s care, the government is \nattempting to pull the rug out from under USCCB’s programs by halting funding.   \n5.  On January 24, 2025, without prior notice, the State Department suspended fund-\ning for refugee resettlement nationwide by issuing suspension letters to its resettlement partners \n(the “Refugee Funding Suspension”).  USCCB received a cursory, two-page letter from PRM \nnotifying the organization that its cooperative agreements were immediately suspended.  The \nsuspension letter’s only justifications were a reference to a recent Executive Order directing the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 4 of 35\nsuspension of funding for foreign aid and a vague suggestion that the awards may not be con-\nsistent with the State Department’s priorities.  Since the suspension, the State Department has \nnot made any payments to USCCB.  Although the suspension letter purported to allow reim-\nbursement for refugee-assistance work already completed before January 24, the State Depart-\nment has refused to reimburse USCCB for those expenses as well.  \n6.  The consequences of the Refugee Funding Suspension have been predictably \ndevastating for USCCB and the refugees it supports.  At the time of the suspension, there were \nmore than 6,700 refugees assigned to USCCB by the government that were still within their 90-\nday transition period.  As a direct result of the suspension, USCCB has millions of dollars in \npending, unpaid reimbursements for services already rendered to refugees and is accruing mil-\nlions more each week—with no indication that any future reimbursements will be paid or that \nthe program will ever resume.  USCCB has already been forced to initiate layoffs for fifty em-\nployees.  It faces irreparable damage to its longstanding refugee resettlement programs and its \nreputation  and  relationship  with  its  subrecipients  and  the  refugee  populations  it  serves.  \nUSCCB’s inability to reimburse its partner organizations, in turn, has required some of those \norganizations to lay off staff and may require them to stop providing aid for housing, food, and \nresettlement support to refugees.  Refugees who have already entered the United States may \nsoon be cut off from support, contravening the statutorily expressed will of Congress and mak-\ning it more difficult for them to establish themselves as productive members of society. \n7.  The government’s sudden Refugee Funding Suspension is unlawful.  It violates \nmultiple statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and undermines the \nConstitution’s separation of powers. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 5 of 35\n8.  First, the Refugee Funding Suspension contravenes appropriations-related stat-\nutes and flouts the Constitution’s vesting of the power of the purse in Congress.  Congress has \nappropriated specific sums of money for refugee assistance and resettlement to remain available \nuntil expended, and it has mandated that the government provide prompt and adequate funding \nfor the initial resettlement of refugees that the government has admitted and assigned to agencies \nlike USCCB.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).  Given the continuing availability of appropriations, the \nExecutive Branch cannot unilaterally and indefinitely refuse to fund those statutorily mandated \nservices.  See Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 41–44 (1975).  In addition, the Impound-\nment Control Act sets forth specific procedural and substantive requirements for Executive \nBranch attempts to delay spending of appropriated funds—requirements that were not satisfied \nby the Refugee Funding Suspension.  2 U.S.C. § 684.  The suspension therefore exceeds the \ngovernment’s statutory authority.  By ignoring Congress’s appropriations decisions, moreover, \nthe suspension undermines the Constitution’s separation of powers, which provides that Con-\ngress, not the Executive Branch, decides how public funds shall be spent. \n9.  Second, the Refugee Funding Suspension is arbitrary and capricious.  For the \nfirst time in forty-five years, and without warning, the government has cut off funding to \nUSCCB for the essential services USCCB provides to government-approved refugees, including \nrefugees already placed with USCCB and its subrecipients.  In doing so, the government entirely \nfailed to consider and address the obvious and catastrophic consequences that an immediate \nfunding suspension would impose on USCCB, its subrecipients, and individual refugees—let \nalone those parties’ significant, reasonable reliance interests in continued funding.  Nor did it \nconsider the obvious, less-disruptive alternative of reviewing its outstanding agreements before \nhalting funds to active awardees.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 6 of 35\n10.  The reasons the government did provide for its action only heighten the suspen-\nsion’s arbitrariness.  Although the suspension letter mentioned in passing an Executive Order \npausing foreign aid, that Executive Order on its face does not apply to USCCB’s cooperative \nagreements, which exclusively provide “domestic assistance” to government-vetted refugees lo-\ncated in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(3) (emphasis added).  And the suspension letter’s \nnebulous reference to the State Department’s policy priorities did nothing to explain why \nUSCCB’s agreements—suddenly after decades of continuity—might be inconsistent with those \npriorities.  The government also has given no explanation for its tacit refusal to reimburse pre-\nJanuary 24 expenses under USCCB’s cooperative agreements.   \n11.  Third, the Refugee Funding Suspension is unlawful because it was done without \npublic notice and opportunity to comment.  5 U.S.C. § 553.  The suspension is a legislative or \nsubstantive rule because it prospectively alters the legal rights or interests of USCCB and thou-\nsands of refugees already present in the United States.  Yet the government did not provide \nnotice to or solicit input from affected parties and the public at large, as the APA requires.   \n12.  The government’s suspension of funds that USCCB spends on initial refugee-\nresettlement services under its cooperative agreements with the State Department is unlawful.  \nThis Court should declare Defendants’ actions unlawful and set them aside and order Defend-\nants to resume reimbursements pursuant to the cooperative agreements so that USCCB’s vital \nwork assisting lawfully admitted refugees may continue.  \nPARTIES \n13.  The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is an American nonprofit cor-\nporation whose members are the active Cardinals, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic \nChurch in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  USCCB is incorporated as a non-profit \nand headquartered in the District of Columbia.  USCCB provides refugee-resettlement services \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 7 of 35\nto government-vetted refugees and special immigrant visa holders from Afghanistan within the \nUnited States. \n14.  Defendant the Department of State is a department of the federal government.  It \nreceives appropriations from Congress to administer refugee-resettlement programs authorized \nunder the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-510, 76 Stat. 112 \n(1962), and the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980).  \n15.  Defendant Marco Rubio is the Secretary of State.  In that role, he is responsible \nfor oversight of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which is responsible for providing \nthe cooperative-agreement awards to USCCB.  Secretary Rubio is sued in his official capacity. \n16.  Defendant Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration is a bureau within the State \nDepartment.  PRM has been delegated responsibility for entering into cooperative agreements with \nprivate resettlement agencies, including USCCB, to implement the programs of initial resettlement for \nrefugees and special immigrant visa holders.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(b).     \n17.  Defendant Jennifer Davis is the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau \nof Population, Refugees, and Migration.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Davis is the highest-\nranking official at PRM with supervisory authority over the Bureau.  Ms. Davis is sued in her \nofficial capacity.   \n18.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) is a depart-\nment of the federal government.  HHS processes the government’s payments to USCCB pursu-\nant to the terms of its cooperative agreements.   \n19.  Defendant Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is the Secretary of HHS.  Secretary Kennedy \nis sued in his official capacity.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 8 of 35\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims alleged in this complaint under \n28 U.S.C. § 1331, because they arise under federal law, including the Administrative Procedure \nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n21.  Sovereign immunity has been waived under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n22.  Venue lies in the District of Columbia because USCCB is incorporated and head-\nquartered in the District.    28  U.S.C.  § 1391(e)(1)(C).  Venue is also proper in this District \nbecause the State Department and HHS are also headquartered in Washington, D.C., and Secre-\ntary Rubio, Secretary Kennedy, and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Davis maintain their \nprincipal offices in Washington, D.C.  Id. § 1391(e)(1)(A).  On information and belief, Defend-\nants’ decisions regarding PRM programming and USCCB funding have been made in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia.  Id. § 1391(e)(1)(B).  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  USCCB Cared For Refugees In The United States For Decades Before It Partnered \nWith The Government \n23.  The Catholic Church has cared for refugees since the earliest days of Christianity.  \nSee The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and the Catholic Church, USCCB Off. of Pol’y & \nAdvoc. (Jan. 26, 2025), https://perma.cc/D7FC-WKKL.  The “duty of giving foreigners a hos-\npitable reception” is “imposed by human solidarity and by Christian charity.”  Pope Paul VI, \nPopulorum Progressio (Mar. 26, 1967), https://perma.cc/N36H-3FSX.  “Jesus Christ, loving \neveryone with a universal love, educates us in the permanent recognition of the dignity of every \nhuman being, without exception.”  Letter of the Holy Father Francis to the Bishops of the United \nStates of America (Feb. 10, 2025), https://perma.cc/38MM-RR4Z. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 9 of 35\n24.  In the United States specifically, the Church’s refugee-resettlement efforts long \npredate its partnership with the federal government.  The Church first coordinated efforts to \nreceive and integrate those displaced by World War II in dioceses across the United States, and \nlater welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing communist persecution in the Soviet \nUnion, Hungary, Vietnam, and Cuba.  See Catholic Ministries Serving Migrants and Refugees, \nUSCCB, https://perma.cc/ZSD8-879C (last visited Feb. 14, 2025).   \n25.  Since 1965, USCCB has carried out this institutional mission in the United \nStates.  USCCB does so not because the refugees are Catholic (many are not), “but because we \nare Catholic.”  Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, Setting the record straight, Chicago Catholic (Feb. 5, \n2025), https://perma.cc/TZM6-VBZ4.  In this way, USCCB discharges the mandate of the Gos-\npel:  “I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and \nyou welcomed me.”  Id. (quoting Matthew 25:35). \nII.  Congress Has Required Funding For Resettlement Of Admitted Refugees For \nDecades \n26.  For more than sixty years, Congress likewise has recognized that refugee assis-\ntance and resettlement is not just a moral imperative, but also is essential to this country’s inter-\nests.  In 1962, in response to the increase of refugees fleeing communist countries, Congress \npassed the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, which authorized the appropriation of funds \nto address “urgent refugee and migration needs.”  Pub. L. No. 87-510, 76 Stat. 121, 122 (1962) \n(codified as amended at 22 U.S.C. § 2601(c)); see also Refugee Timeline, USCIS (last updated \nJan. 24, 2025), https://perma.cc/F8PM-H27V.  \n27.  In 1980, Congress enacted the Refugee Act, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 \n(1980) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1521 et seq.).  That Act declared that “it is the historic policy of \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 10 of 35\nthe United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their home-\nlands,” including through “efforts to promote opportunities for resettlement.”  Refugee Act of \n1980, § 101, 94 Stat. at 102.  Consistent with that purpose, the Refugee Act of 1980 created a \nstatutory framework for the admission and resettlement of refugees known as the U.S. Refugee \nAdmissions Program.    \n28.  Under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, individuals outside the United \nStates who have been persecuted or fear persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or \ncertain  other  grounds  can  seek  legal  admission  into  the  United  States.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§§ 1101(a)(42), 1157(c).   Refugees are screened abroad for eligibility and admissibility—a rig-\norous process that involves security and biometric checks, interviews, and medical screening, \namong other things.  Refugee Processing and Security Screening, USCIS (last visited Feb. 14, \n2025), https://perma.cc/4A8C-EQRZ.  If approved as refugees, the individuals are admitted into \nthe United States.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1157(c)(1), 1181(c).  The President determines the maximum \nnumber of refugees to be admitted each fiscal year.  Id. § 1157(a)(2), (3).  Since 1990, around \n65,000 refugees have been admitted per year on average.  Off. of Homeland Sec. Stat., Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., Refugees: 2023, at 4 (Nov. 2024), https://perma.cc/8NAF-ST46. \n29.  A core component of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is federal funding \nfor “domestic assistance” for the resettlement of newly arrived refugees, in partnership with \nprivate non-profit organizations.  8 U.S.C. § 1522.  Rather than rely entirely on private charitable \norganizations to provide resettlement assistance, Congress made it the “policy of the United \nStates” to commit federal funds in order to “promote opportunities for [refugee] resettlement.”   \nRefugee Act of 1980, § 101, 94 Stat. at 102.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 11 of 35\n30.  Although refugee resettlement is multifaceted, the resettlement program at issue \nhere is the “[p]rogram of initial resettlement.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b).  Under that program, the \nSecretary of State has been designated by the President to “make grants to, and contracts with, \npublic or private nonprofit agencies for initial resettlement . . . of refugees in the United States.”  \nId. § 1522(b)(1)(A), (B); see also HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 319 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021) \n(“Since 1981, the Department of State has overseen the program.”).  Congress has made the \nsame funding available for special immigrant visa holders from Afghanistan—i.e., those who \nassisted the U.S. Mission in Afghanistan and fear reprisals as a result.1  See Afghan Allies Pro-\ntection Act, § 602(b)(8), Pub. L. No. 111-8, 123 Stat. 807, 809 (2009) (codified in the notes of \n8 U.S.C. § 1101). \n31.  The Secretary of State has charged PRM with administering the initial-resettle-\nment program.  PRM discharges that responsibility by entering into annual cooperative agree-\nments with resettlement agencies.  There are currently ten resettlement agencies, including \nUSCCB.  United States Refugee Admissions Program Flowchart, USCIS & Bureau of Popula-\ntion, Refugees, and Migration (Sept. 18, 2024), https://perma.cc/F5PJ-ZV3X.  Under the coop-\nerative agreements, PRM awards specific sums to each resettlement agency to reimburse ex-\npenses the agency incurs supporting refugees for up to the first 90 days they are in the United \nStates.  This funding covers critical services, such as housing, food, clothing, and assistance \nwith access to social, medical, educational, and employment services.  The State Department’s \npayments to USCCB under the cooperative agreements are made through the Department of \nHealth and Human Services’ Payment Management System.   \n \n1 For simplicity, this complaint refers to special immigrant visa holders and refugees collectively \nas “refugees.”   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 12 of 35\n32.  Once PRM enters into these cooperative agreements, the agency has a statutory \nobligation to provide adequate initial-resettlement funding for admitted refugees “to the extent \nof available appropriations.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A).2  In particular, and among other things, \nthe agency “shall, to the extent of available appropriations”: (1) “make available sufficient re-\nsources for employment training and placement in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency \namong refugees as quickly as possible”; and (2) “provide refugees with the opportunity to ac-\nquire sufficient English language training to enable them to become effectively resettled as \nquickly as possible.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n33.  Consistent with those statutory commands, State Department regulations provide \nthat “[p]ayments for allowable costs” incurred by resettlement agencies “must not be with-\nheld . . . unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or” if the “recipient or subrecipient has \nfailed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt.”  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) (OMB regulations incorporated by reference into the State Depart-\nment’s federal award regulations at 2 C.F.R. § 600.101).   \n34.  For decades, on a bipartisan basis, Congress has consistently appropriated funds \nfor refugee resettlement.  In 1985, for example, Congress appropriated $344,730,000 annually \nto the State Department for “Migration and Refugee Assistance.”  Foreign Relations Authoriza-\ntion Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-93, § 101, 99 Stat. 405, 407 (1985); see \nalso Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-236, \n \n2 Although Section 1522(a) names the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the De-\npartment of Health and Human Services, the Director’s statutory obligations with respect to initial \nresettlement have been transferred by presidential designation to the Secretary of State (and dele-\ngated to PRM) under Section 1522(b).  The Department of Health and Human Services and Sec-\nretary Kennedy are named as defendants out of an abundance of caution, because HHS’s Payment \nManagement System is used to make payments to USCCB. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 13 of 35\n§ 104, 108 Stat. 382, 390 (1994) (appropriating about $590,000,000 for the same); Department \nof State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. L. No. 113-\n235, 128 Stat. 2573, 2589 (2014) (appropriating $931,886,000 for the same); Additional Af-\nghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-43, 135 Stat. 372, 375 \n(2021) (appropriating $415,000,000 for fiscal year 2022 to “address humanitarian needs in, and \nto assist refugees from, Afghanistan”).  \n35.  Congress’s most recent appropriations have been no different.  In 2024, Congress \nappropriated $3,928,000,000 to implement, among other things, “the Migration and Refugee \nAssistance Act of 1962 . . . and other activities to meet refugee and migration needs.”  Depart-\nment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \nNo. 118-47, 138 Stat. 729, 744 (2024); see also, e.g., Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Ap-\npropriations Act, 2022, 135 Stat. at 374–75 (appropriating $976,100,000 for special immigrant \nvisa holders from Afghanistan, among other things). \n36.  Independent of the statutory scheme requiring the government to adequately fund \ninitial resettlement for admitted refugees, Congress also has enacted the Impoundment Control \nAct.  See 2 U.S.C. § 682 et seq.  That Act regulates the Executive Branch’s authority to “defer” \nthe spending of appropriated funds by imposing substantive limitations and procedural require-\nments.  Id. § 684.  Most relevant here, before the Executive Branch can defer the use of appro-\npriated funds, the Act requires the President to transmit a “special message” to both houses of \nCongress with specific details about the proposed deferral, including the amount to be deferred, \nthe deferral’s duration, “the reasons for the proposed deferral,” and “the estimated fiscal, eco-\nnomic, and budgetary effect” it will have.  Id. § 684(a).  The Act also denies the Executive \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 14 of 35\nBranch any authority to defer spending except for three specified reasons; it forbids deferrals \nbased on policy disagreements with Congress.  Id. § 684(b).  \nIII.  USCCB’s Refugee-Resettlement Program And Cooperative Agreements \n37.  Each year since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, USCCB has entered \ninto agreements with the federal government to provide initial-resettlement services for refu-\ngees.  USCCB receives and coordinates the distribution of PRM awards for initial resettlement \nthrough its Migration & Refugee Service.  USCCB partners with subrecipients, most of whom \nare local Catholic Charities, across the United States to accomplish this work.  These partners \nare strategically chosen in concert with the State Department and state refugee coordinators to \nachieve goals such as partnering with subrecipients in locations that will facilitate family reuni-\nfication efforts.   \n38.  Today, USCCB runs the largest non-governmental refugee-resettlement program \nin  the  United  States.    Resettlement  Services,  USCCB,  (last  visited  Feb.  14,  2025) \nhttps://perma.cc/2DPN-M47N.  USCCB currently serves approximately 17% of refugees being \nresettled in the United States.  And since 1980, USCCB has provided refugee-resettlement ser-\nvices to more than 930,000 refugees.  \n39.  In providing this assistance, USCCB has consistently devoted more resources \nthan it receives in related federal funding.  In 2023, for example, USCCB paid $4 million more \non its refugee-resettlement and related programs than it received from the federal government.  \nKPMG, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Affiliates: Consolidated Financial \nStatements with Supplemental Schedules, December 31, 2023 and 2022, at 30 (Aug. 16, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/59YQ-TH5L.  And those numbers do not account for the additional cash, in-\nkind contributions, or volunteer services provided by local Catholic Charities and other subre-\ncipients. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 15 of 35\n40.  For Fiscal Year 2025, USCCB entered into two cooperative agreements with \nPRM awarding USCCB around $65 million for initial refugee resettlement.  One of the agree-\nments covers refugees; the other covers refugees and special immigrant visa holders from Af-\nghanistan, who are treated like refugees for initial-resettlement purposes.  In all other relevant \nrespects, the terms of the cooperative agreements are materially identical.  Both cooperative \nagreements run from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.   \n41.  Both cooperative agreements require USCCB to “[a]ssume responsibility for \nsponsorship of the refugees assigned to” it “under this agreement.”  On the day a refugee is \nadmitted, USCCB must ensure that each refugee is met at the airport, transported to their home, \nand provided a first meal as well as food and clothing for their immediate needs.  USCCB also \nmust ensure that “refugees assigned to it” are provided the required home visits within 72 hours \nof arrival, and that the housing provided to the refugees is safe, sanitary, and adequately fur-\nnished.  USCCB must then assist refugees with, among other things, applications for social se-\ncurity cards, health insurance and medical care, English-language programs, cultural orienta-\ntion, and employment services during the first 90 days they are in the United States.   \nIV.  The President And Secretary Of State Issued Orders Suspending Foreign Aid and \nRefugee Admissions \n42.  Starting on January 20, 2025, both the President and the Secretary of State issued \norders suspending foreign aid and refugee admissions into the United States.  But none of those \norders expressly suspends funding for the resettlement of admitted refugees. \n43.  On January 20, President Trump signed an executive order titled “Reevaluating \nand Realigning United States Foreign Aid.”  Exec. Order No. 14,169, 90 Fed. Reg. 8619 \n(Jan. 20, 2025) (“Foreign Aid Executive Order”).  The Foreign Aid Executive Order directs \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 16 of 35\nrelevant Executive Branch officials to institute a “90-day pause in United States foreign devel-\nopment assistance” pending review for programmatic efficiency and policy alignment, subject \nto waivers authorized by the Secretary of State for specific programs.  Id. § 3(a).  On the same \nday, President Trump signed an executive order titled “Realigning the United States Refugee \nAdmissions Program.”  Exec. Order No. 14,163, 90 Fed. Reg. 8459 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“Refugee \nExecutive Order”).  The Refugee Executive Order suspends the entry of new refugees into the \nUnited States with narrow exceptions.  \n44.  On January 24, Secretary of State Rubio issued an order to all State Department \ndiplomatic and consular posts stating that “[c]onsistent with” the Foreign Aid Executive Order, \n“all new obligations of funding . . . for foreign assistance programs funded by or through the \nDepartment and USAID” would be paused “pending a review.”  Memorandum from Secretary \nof  State  to  All  Diplomatic  and  Consular  Posts,  Dep’t  of  State  (Jan.  24,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/J26T-VCJR (“Rubio Memo”).  The Rubio Memo instructed that for “existing \nforeign assistance awards, contracting officers and grant officers shall immediately issue stop-\nwork orders, consistent with the terms of the relevant award, until such time as the Secretary \nshall determine, following a review.”  Id.  The Rubio Memo also provided for waivers for lim-\nited circumstances.  Id. \nV.  The Government Abruptly Suspended Funding For Refugee Resettlement  \n45.  Although none of the President’s or Secretary of State’s orders mentions (let \nalone pauses) funding for the resettlement of refugees already admitted into the United States, \nthe State Department decided suddenly to suspend refugee-resettlement funding as well (the \n“Refugee Funding Suspension”).  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 17 of 35\n46.  On January 24, on information and belief, PRM sent materially identical suspen-\nsion letters to its resettlement agencies, including USCCB.  See, e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 196–97, \nPacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-255 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 10, 2025).   \n47.  The two-page suspension letter USCCB received stated that “consistent with” \nthe Foreign Aid Executive Order, awards pursuant to USCCB’s cooperative agreements with \nthe State Department were “immediately suspended as of January 24, 2025” “pending a Depart-\nment-wide review of foreign assistance programs.”  Ex. A (“Suspension Letter”).  The suspen-\nsion letter instructed that immediately upon receipt, USCCB “must stop all work under the \naward(s) and not incur any new costs after” January 24 and “cancel as many outstanding obli-\ngations as possible.”  Id.   \n48.  The suspension letter provided only two perfunctory reasons for the sudden sus-\npension.  First, the order stated that the suspension was “[c]onsistent with the President’s Exec-\nutive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” without addressing \nhow domestic refugee resettlement constitutes foreign aid.  Id.  Second, the letter stated that the \naward to USCCB “may no longer effectuate agency priorities,” without addressing what the \nagency’s priorities are or why the awards may no longer effectuate those priorities.  Id.  The \nletter did not explain why the government had elected to suspend funding pending its reevalua-\ntion of priorities rather than conduct that review before cutting off funding midstream. \n49.  The suspension letter also stated that USCCB could “submit payment requests \nfor legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of” the letter “or legitimate expenses associated \nwith the” funding suspension.  Id.  But the government has thus far refused to reimburse USCCB \nfor more than $13 million in reimbursement funds for initial-resettlement services rendered be-\nfore January 24. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 18 of 35\n50.  On January 28, USCCB responded to PRM.  USCCB explained that its resettle-\nment program services “includ[e] the provision of housing support, emergency food assistance, \nand emergency medical care to newly arrived refugees and Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) hold-\ners who have been processed and approved for resettlement in the United States by the federal \ngovernment.”  Ex. B.  USCCB urged that its programs were consistent with the “Administra-\ntion’s goals to make the United States safer and stronger, as it operates domestically to ensure \nthat newly arrived refugees and SIV holders are able to integrate successfully into local com-\nmunities.”  Id.  USCCB also explained that it did not understand their awards to represent “new \ncosts” and that the organization is entitled to reimbursement for all costs for serving “refugees \nand SIV holders in their initial 90-day . . . service periods.”  Id.  USCCB also inquired about \n“legitimate expenses” it incurred before January 24, 2025.  Id.   \n51.  On January 31, 2025, in providing an update about payment requests, PRM stated \nthat the suspension was issued in order to “compl[y] with the [Foreign Aid] Executive Order.”  \nEx. C.  PRM also directed USCCB to “abide by the notice of suspension issued to [the] organi-\nzation.”  Id.   \nVI.  The Refugee Funding Suspension Has Inflicted Swift And Irreparable Harm \n52.  On January 25, 2025, the day after USCCB received the suspension letter, there \nwere 6,758 refugees that had been assigned by the federal government to USCCB’s care and \nwho had been in the United States for 90 days or less.   \n53.  In the ordinary course, USCCB receives subrecipient reimbursement requests for \nrefugee-resettlement services rendered and submits reimbursements to PRM’s grants office.  \nThose funds are typically available to USCCB within 24 to 48 hours.  USCCB then pays its \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 19 of 35\nsubrecipients for the refugee-resettlement services provided pursuant to the cooperative agree-\nments and pays its own administrative costs, operating costs, and the salaries of resettlement \nstaff provided for in the agreements.   \n54.  As a result of the Refugee Funding Suspension, however, USCCB has not been \nreimbursed for services provided to the thousands of refugees that have been assigned to it.  \nUSCCB has not been paid for services provided as far back as November 2024, or for services \nrendered after January 24 to the refugees already allocated to USCCB’s care for their initial-\nresettlement period.  USCCB is currently awaiting approximately $13 million of unpaid reim-\nbursements and currently owes an additional $11.6 million to its subrecipients that it is unable \nto reimburse.  These numbers will continue to rise by millions of dollars every week that the \nRefugee Funding Suspension remains in effect.  USCCB has also received no guidance from \nPRM as to the applicability of any waiver or the already-incurred “legitimate expenses.”   \n55.  The consequences of that funding shortfall have been predictably devastating.  \nAs a result of that shortfall, on February 7, USCCB was forced to give four-weeks’ notice of \nplanned termination to 50 staff members in its Migration & Refugee Services office, more than \nhalf of its refugee-resettlement staff.  Those staff members have accumulated expertise with \nUSCCB’s programs, partners, and the refugees USCCB serves; losing them will negatively af-\nfect USCCB’s ability to provide refugee resettlement services in the future. \n56.  Likewise, USCCB cannot sustain the current scale of its refugee resettlement \nservices without federal funding.  The fact that federal funding is integral to USCCB’s resettle-\nment services is a direct result of congressional decisions about the design of the program and \nthe appropriations directed it.  And the uncertainty now surrounding the funding and USCCB’s \npartnership with the government will cause long-term, potentially catastrophic consequences to \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 20 of 35\nUSCCB’s programs, as the substantial financial risk of partnering with the government to pro-\nvide these services is too high if reimbursements can be arbitrarily and unlawfully suspended.   \n57.  USCCB also faces reputational harm as an employer and as a provider of refugee \nresettlement  services.    The  Refugee  Funding  Suspension  has  caused  irreparable  harm  to \nUSCCB’s reputation and relationships with its subrecipients, who have stopped receiving pay-\nments from USCCB despite expecting their ordinary-course reimbursements.  USCCB’s inabil-\nity to meet its subrecipients’ expectations will harm those relationships and make it less likely \nthat subrecipients will be willing to rely on and partner with USCCB in fulfilling refugee-assis-\ntance cooperative agreements—or other programs—in the future.  The reputational harm and \nstaff reductions suffered by USCCB’s subrecipients will also make it more difficult to partner \nwith those organizations going forward. \n58.  The Refugee Funding Suspension also may soon cause irreparable harm to the \nrefugees in USCCB’s care, who rely on the resettlement program’s material assistance, language \neducation, and job training in their first 90 days in this country.  Although USCCB and its sub-\nrecipients so far have been able to maintain resettlement services for the refugees in their care, \nthey soon will be unable to do so.  With each day that passes while the suspension is in effect, \nthe more likely it becomes that USCCB’s subrecipients will be unable to provide services to \nthese refugees.  \n59.  The Refugee Funding Suspension also harms the public interest.  USCCB and its \nsubgrantees provide essential services to vulnerable, new members of American society who \nhave entered this country legally after being thoroughly vetted by multiple federal agencies.  \nThe services provided by USCCB and its subrecipients successfully integrate refugees into com-\nmunities and enable refugees to be self-sufficient, consistent with congressional directives.  See, \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 21 of 35\ne.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a).  And the results bear out Congress’s judgment.  When so integrated, \nrefugees have a significant, positive impact on society and the U.S. economy:  From 2005 to \n2019, for example, refugees served by the Department of Health and Human Service’s Office \nof Refugee Resettlement yielded a net positive fiscal impact of $123.8 billion and generated \n$581 billion in revenue for state and federal governments.  See Off. of Assistant Sec’y for Plan. \n& Evaluation, U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., The Fiscal Impact of Refugees and Asylees \nat  the  Federal,  State,  and  Local  Levels  from  2005  to  2019,  at  4  (Feb.  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y95E-QLWS.  And Congress’s passage of the Migration and Refugee Assis-\ntance Act of 1962, the Refugee Act of 1980, and the decades-worth of consistent and meaningful \nappropriations for refugee resettlement express the wise judgment of multiple Congresses and \nPresidents that providing refugee resettlement services is in the public interest. \nCOUNT I \nAdministrative Procedure Act and Equitable Cause of Action \n(Violations of Appropriations Statutes) \n60.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n61.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside agency action that \nis “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” “in excess of statutory juris-\ndiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or “without observance of proce-\ndure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)–(D). \n62.  The Refugee Funding Suspension undermines the Constitution’s separation of \npowers, contravenes statutes requiring the government to provide certain forms of refugee as-\nsistance to the extent of available appropriations, and violates the Impoundment Control Act’s \nsubstantive and procedural requirements.    \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 22 of 35\n63.  The Constitution vests the power of the purse in Congress.  The Appropriations \nClause and Article I ensure “that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult \njudgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to the individual \nfavor of Government agents.”  Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427–28 (1990) \n(emphasis added).  “If it were otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded power over \nthe public purse of the nation; and might apply all its moneyed resources at his pleasure.”  Id. at \n427 (quoting Joseph Story, 2 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1348 \n(3d ed. 1858)).   \n64.  Those principles apply with equal force when the Executive Branch refuses to \nspend money that Congress has appropriated for specific purposes.   In those circumstances, the \n“practical effect” of Executive impoundments is to unilaterally negate appropriations statutes, \ncontravening the “‘finely wrought’ procedure that the Framers designed” for the enactment or \nrepeal of a law.  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438–40 (1998).  That is why “where \npreviously appropriated money is available for an agency to perform a statutorily mandated \nactivity,” there is “no basis for a court to excuse the agency from that statutory mandate.”  In re \nAiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n65.  When the Executive Branch ignores Congress’s instructions with respect to ap-\npropriations, it arrogates to itself Congress’s power of the purse.  That threatens to concentrate \n“power in the hands of a single branch” at grave risk to individual liberty, which is “always at \nstake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers.”  Clinton, \n524 U.S. at 450 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The Executive’s power therefore is at its “lowest \nebb” when it defies Congress’s appropriations laws.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 23 of 35\n66.  Here, Congress has imposed (with the President’s assent) two independent re-\nstrictions on the Executive Branch’s ability to suspend funding for refugee resettlement:  First, \nit has enacted a statute mandating that the State Department spend available appropriations on \ncertain forms of assistance for refugees it has admitted; and, second, it has enacted the Impound-\nment Control Act, which permits the Executive Branch to defer spending appropriated funds \nonly for particular reasons and after complying with specific procedures.  The government has \ndefied both of those congressional commands.   \n67.  First, the Refugee Funding Suspension contravenes Congress’s command that in \nadministering the initial-resettlement program, the government must promptly provide certain \nservices to admitted refugees.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Refugee \nAct of 1980, provides that once the Secretary has begun “providing assistance” to refugees by \nresettling them in the United States and placing them in the care of a non-governmental entity \nlike USCCB, the Secretary must provide funding to those refugees “to the extent of available \nappropriations.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  Among other things, the Secre-\ntary “shall” make available “as quickly as possible” “sufficient resources for employment train-\ning” and for “sufficient English language training.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n68.  Here, the government has chosen to enter into cooperative agreements and thus \nto “provid[e] assistance” to admitted refugees.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A).  At the time of the \nRefugee Funding Suspension, it had assigned nearly 7,000 refugees to USCCB who were in the \nUnited States for 90 days or less.  The government therefore has an obligation to make available \nfunding for resettling those refugees “as quickly as possible” and “to the extent of available \nappropriations.”  Id.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 24 of 35\n69.  The government has made no suggestion that the funds Congress appropriated to \nsupport this program have been exhausted.  Last year alone, Congress appropriated $3.9 billion \nto the State Department for, among other things, “migration and refugee assistance.”  Depart-\nment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024, 138 Stat. \nat 744; see also Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, 135 Stat. at \n375 (appropriating an additional $976,100,000 for special immigrant visa holders from Afghan-\nistan, among other things).  Yet the government, through the Refugee Funding Suspension, is \nindefinitely refusing to spend that money, even though Congress has commanded that it do so \nfor statutorily mandated purposes—including providing employment and English training to \nrefugees already placed with USCCB.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A).  The government instead \nhas left USCCB and its assigned refugees to fend for themselves.  The Refugee Act of 1980 \nsimply does not give the government “discretionary control over the outlay of funds” that Con-\ngress not only has appropriated for these specific purposes but also mandated that the govern-\nment spend for those same purposes.  Train, 420 U.S. at 45. \n70.  Second, the Refugee Funding Suspension is independently unlawful because it \nviolates the Impoundment Control Act.  That Act limits the authority of Executive Branch “to \ndefer any budget authority provided for a specific purpose or project.”  2 U.S.C. § 684(a).  It \ndefines a “deferral of budget authority” broadly to include “withholding or delaying the obliga-\ntion or expenditure of budget authority . . . provided for projects or activities,” or “any other \ntype of Executive action or inaction which effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure \nof budget authority.”  Id. § 682(1) (emphasis added); see Matter of Henry M. Jackson, U.S. \nSenate, B-200685, 1980 WL 14499, at *1 (Comp. Gen. Dec. 23, 1980) (“[A]ny executive branch \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 25 of 35\naction or inaction whether based on programmatic, budgetary, or other factors, is potentially \nsubject to the Impoundment Control Act if it precludes or delays, the use of budget authority.”).  \n71.  The Impoundment Control Act establishes procedural requirements for deferring \nbudget activities required by Congress.  If an agency intends to defer spending money that it has \nbeen appropriated, “the President shall transmit” a special message to Congress specifying, \namong other things, how much budget authority he wishes to defer and for how long, the specific \nprojects or governmental functions involved, his reasons and legal authority for doing so, and \nthe “fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the proposed deferral.”  2 U.S.C. § 684(a).   \n72.  The Impoundment Control Act also imposes substantive limits on the Executive \nBranch’s authority to defer budget authority.  “Deferrals shall be permissible only” to “(1) pro-\nvide for contingencies; (2) to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in require-\nments or greater efficiency of operations; or (3) as specifically provided by law.”  Id. § 684(b) \n(emphasis added).  “No officer or employee of the United States may defer any budget authority \nfor any other purpose”—including based on policy disagreements.  Id.  As the D.C. Circuit has \nexplained, a “President sometimes has policy reasons (as distinct from constitutional reasons) \n. . . for wanting to spend less than the full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular \nproject or program.”  In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 261 n.1.  “But in those circumstances, \neven the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.”  Id.  “Instead, \nthe President must propose the rescission of funds” under the Impoundment Control Act, “and \nCongress then may decide whether to approve a rescission bill.”  Id. \n73.  Here, the Refugee Funding Suspension effects a “deferral of budget authority” \nwithin the meaning of the Impoundment Control Act.  The suspension indefinitely halts the \ndisbursement of millions in funds that Congress appropriated to the government for refugee \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 26 of 35\nassistance and the government committed to expending through cooperative agreements with \nUSCCB.  Despite Congress’s specific appropriation of funds for refugee assistance, the govern-\nment seeks categorically not to spend those funds indefinitely.  That is unquestionably a “de-\nlay[]” in the “expenditure of budget authority” or an “action” that “effectively precludes the . . . \nexpenditure of budget authority” under the Impoundment Control Act.  2 U.S.C. § 682(1); see \nalso New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 357368, at *2 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025) (Executive Branch’s \nindefinite pause of all federal financial assistance likely violates the Impoundment Control Act).  \n74.  The Refugee Funding Suspension’s deferral of budget authority violates the Im-\npoundment Control Act’s procedural requirements by ignoring them altogether.  There is no \nindication that the President has transmitted to Congress any special message explaining and \njustifying the deferral of budgetary authority effected by the Refugee Funding Suspension, as \nthe Act requires.  See 2 U.S.C. § 684(a).  The Act’s procedural requirements would have forced \nthe government to consider and explain the consequences of its sudden funding suspension be-\nfore acting.  The government’s failure to do so violates the Act.   \n75.  The Refugee Funding Suspension also runs afoul of the substantive limitations \nimposed by the Act.  USCCB’s suspension letter states that the government is deferring spend-\ning because the awards “may no longer effectuate agency priorities.”  Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \nsupra.  To the extent that rationale has any discernable meaning at all, it expresses nothing more \nthan a pure policy disagreement—indeed, merely a potential policy disagreement. As the D.C. \nCircuit has recognized, such policy disagreements fall outside the Act’s three enumerated cate-\ngories of permissible deferrals.  2 U.S.C. § 684(b)(1)–(3); In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 261 \nn.1 (“[I]n those circumstances, even the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to \nspend the funds”).   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 27 of 35\n76.  The Refugee Funding Suspension thus violates both the Refugee Act of 1980 and \nits related appropriations statutes, and the Impoundment Control Act—all in contravention of \nthe Constitution’s separation of powers.  To the extent that the government might argue that the \nForeign Aid Executive Order or the Rubio Memo independently justifies or requires the Refugee \nFunding Suspension, those actions are unlawful for the same reasons. \n77.  The Refugee Funding Suspension, including the suspension of reimbursements \nfor pre-January 24 expenses and for ongoing expenses pursuant to USCCB’s cooperative agree-\nments, should be declared unlawful and set aside, as should the Rubio Memo to the extent it \napplies to USCCB.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706.  Defendants and all persons acting in concert with \nthem should be enjoined from enforcing, implementing, or in any manner giving effect to the \nRefugee Funding Suspension—and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Foreign Aid Exec-\nutive Order and Rubio Memo.  See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015) (recognizing equitable cause of action to enjoin “violations of federal \nlaw by federal officials”); Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902).  \nCOUNT II \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n78.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n79.  The Administrative Procedure Act authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set \naside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n80.  The APA requires agency action to be “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  \nOhio v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024) (quotation marks omitted).  Agency action \nis arbitrary and capricious “if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 28 of 35\nit to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an expla-\nnation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible \nthat it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).   \n81.  Among the most important factors that an agency must consider are “serious re-\nliance interests” engendered by its prior policies and significant alternatives to its chosen course \nof action.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (reliance \ninterests); Allied Local & Reg’l Mfrs. Caucus v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 215 F.3d 61, 80 (D.C. Cir. \n2000) (alternatives).   \n82.  The Refugee Funding Suspension is a textbook arbitrary-and-capricious agency \naction.  The government utterly failed to consider the dire consequences of its actions and an \nobvious, superior alternative; it gave no reasoned explanation for its decisions; and it ignored \nits own regulations.   \n83.  First, the government “entirely failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of the \nproblem.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Most glaringly, the government did not account for the \nobvious and serious consequences that an immediate funding suspension would have on award \nrecipients like USCCB, its subrecipients, and individual refugees—including irreparable dam-\nage to USCCB’s reputation, relationships, and mission, and to refugees who lose essential ser-\nvices and training during the critical first months of their resettlement periods.  The government \nmade no effort whatsoever to identify (let alone weigh) the costs and benefits of its blunderbuss \nRefugee Funding Suspension—and tellingly could provide no explanation even after USCCB \nraised these issues with PRM post suspension.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 29 of 35\n84.  In so failing, the government also ignored the substantial, reasonable reliance \ninterests imperiled by a sudden suspension of refugee-assistance awards.  Regents, 591 U.S. at \n30 (“When an agency changes course . . . it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may \nhave engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” (quotation marks \nomitted)); see also Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–\n16 (2009).   \n85.  For decades, USCCB has reasonably relied on awards from the government un-\nder the terms of its cooperative agreements.  USCCB has entered into cooperative agreements \nwith and received reimbursement from the government every year since 1980, and never—not \nuntil the Refugee Funding Suspension—has the government halted funding mid-agreement.  \nUSCCB fulfills its obligations under the agreements to provide high-quality, essential resettle-\nment assistance to thousands of refugees; and it reasonably expects in return, based on past \nexperience and the terms of the agreements, that the government will meet its statutory funding \nobligations.     \n86.  By abruptly cutting off funding without notice, the government predictably evis-\ncerated USCCB’s serious reliance interests.  USCCB has about $13 million (and growing) of \nunreimbursed costs that it incurred prior to the Refugee Funding Suspension in reliance on its \ncooperative agreements and owes an additional $11.6 million to its subrecipients for services \nrendered.  Because of the Refugee Funding Suspension, USCCB on February 7 had no choice \nbut to notify 50 employees—more than half of its refugee resettlement staff—of impending \ntermination.  All of those employees relied on continued funding under USCCB’s cooperative \nagreements.  Moreover, USCCB already has had to stop reimbursing its subrecipients providing \ndirect services to refugees, causing those organizations to go unpaid despite their reliance on \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 30 of 35\nthe State Department’s compliance with its funding obligations.  And most disheartening, law-\nfully admitted refugees who resettled in this country relying on the Department’s promise to aid \ntheir integration may soon lose the essential services provided to them by USCCB and its sub-\nrecipients.  \n87.  The APA “required” the government—before taking action—“to assess whether \nthere were reliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such in-\nterests against competing policy concerns.”  Regents, 591 U.S. at 33.  \n88.  The government also failed to consider an obvious, less disruptive “alternative \nway of achieving [its] objectives,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 48—namely, conducting a review of \nits outstanding cooperative agreements to ensure their compliance with agency priorities before \nhalting funds to active awardees.  The government has “not offered any explanation for why a \nblanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave \nand upended reliance interests for thousands of businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around \nthe country, was a rational precursor to reviewing the programs.”  AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. \nv. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 485324, at *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025).  Indeed, there is no indication \nthat the government considered this alternative, and it certainly did not explain itself.  That \nglaring failure also dooms the Refugee Funding Suspension.  Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. \nv. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 794 F.2d 737, 746 n.36 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“The failure of an agency \nto consider obvious alternatives has led uniformly to reversal.”).   \n89.  Second, the Refugee Funding Suspension is arbitrary and capricious because the \nreasons the government did provide are manifestly inadequate.   \n90.  The government’s first rationale for the Refugee Funding Suspension was that it \nis “[c]onsistent with” the President’s Foreign Aid Executive Order.  Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 31 of 35\nsupra. But that Executive Order applies only to “foreign assistance.”  “Foreign assistance,” \nwhatever its meaning, cannot plausibly include awards to an American non-profit for refugees \nin the United States.  Cf. 22 U.S.C. § 2394(b) (“foreign assistance” means aid provided “to a \nforeign country or international organization”).  That is particularly so because the statute under \nwhich the government provides funding to USCCB refers to awards for refugee resettlement as \n“domestic assistance.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(3) (emphasis added).  At a minimum, the government \nmade no effort to explain how USCCB’s activities constitute “foreign assistance” or how the \nRefugee Funding Suspension otherwise would be “consistent with” the Foreign Aid Executive \nOrder. \n91.  The government’s second rationale for the Refugee Funding Suspension fares no \nbetter.  The government stated that USCCB’s cooperative agreements “may no longer effectuate \nagency priorities,” but it did not explain what those priorities are.  Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \nsupra.  More problematic, the government did not explain why its agreements with USCCB may \nno longer effectuate those priorities—a particularly glaring omission given that the government \nhas continuously funded USCCB’s refugee programs for decades.  It is a basic precept of ad-\nministrative law that “conclusory statements” like these “do not meet the requirement that ‘the \nagency adequately explain its result.’”  Dickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1407 (D.C. Cir. \n1995).   \n92.  To the extent that the Refugee Funding Suspension includes an unwritten sus-\npension of reimbursements for pre-January 24 expenses incurred pursuant to USCCB’s cooper-\native agreements, the government gave no rationale for this action.  It simply stopped reimburs-\ning these expenses even though the written suspension letter that USCCB received contemplates \ntheir reimbursement. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 32 of 35\n93.  Third, in issuing the Refugee Funding Suspension, the government also ignored \nits own regulations.  “[A]n agency action may [also] be set aside as arbitrary and capricious if \nthe agency fails to comply with its own regulations.”  Nat’l Env’t Dev. Ass’n’s Clean Air Project \nv. Env’t Prot. Agency, 752 F.3d 999, 1009 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation and quotation marks omit-\nted).  The State Department has a regulation providing that “[p]ayments for allowable costs \n[incurred under a Federal award] must not be withheld . . . unless required by Federal statute, \nregulations, or” if the “recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and condi-\ntions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) (incorporated \nby reference into the State Department’s federal award regulations at 2 C.F.R. § 600.101).   \n94.  Here, no statute or regulation requires the payments to USCCB to be withheld, \nand the government has not asserted that USCCB has failed to comply with the terms of the \naward or is delinquent in a debt.  And even if the suspension letter theoretically allows reim-\nbursements for “legitimate expenses” incurred prior to January 24, Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \nsupra, the Department’s Refugee Funding Suspension in fact includes an unwritten policy of \nrefusing to reimburse even those “allowable costs,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6).  The govern-\nment’s departure from its own regulations, without explanation, independently violates the APA.  \n95.  For each of these reasons, the Refugee Funding Suspension is arbitrary and ca-\npricious in violation of the APA.  To the extent the government might argue that the Rubio \nMemo or Foreign Aid Executive Order independently justify or require the Refugee Funding \nSuspension, those actions are arbitrary and capricious for the same reasons. \n96.  The Refugee Funding Suspension, including the suspension of reimbursements \nfor pre-January 24 expenses and for ongoing expenses pursuant to USCCB’s cooperative agree-\nments, should be declared unlawful and set aside, as should the Rubio Memo to the extent it \napplies to USCCB.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706.  Defendants and all persons acting in concert \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 33 of 35\nwith them should be enjoined from enforcing, implementing, or in any manner giving effect to \nthe Refugee Funding Suspension—and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Foreign Aid \nExecutive Order and Rubio Memo.  See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327. \nCOUNT III \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(Failure To Conduct Notice-And-Comment Rulemaking) \n97.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n98.  The Refugee Funding Suspension is also a substantive rule issued without the \nnotice-and-comment procedures required by the APA.  Before issuing a “substantive rule,” the \nAdministrative Procedure Act commands agencies to publish a “[g]eneral notice of proposed \nrule making” and “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 553.  An agency’s failure to do so requires setting aside the agency’s resulting action.   \nSee Kooritzky v. Reich, 17 F.3d 1509, 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  \n99.  The Refugee Funding Suspension is a substantive rule because it “alter[s] the \nrights or interests of parties.”  Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 250 (D.C. Cir. \n2014).  Far from merely putting the public “on notice of pre-existing legal obligations or rights” \nor adjudicating an individual’s rights “case-by-case” under pre-existing law, the Refugee Fund-\ning Suspension has the legal effect of prospectively altering the rights of refugees and resettle-\nment organizations like USCCB to receive funding.  Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Wheeler, 955 \nF.3d 68, 83, 85 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  The government therefore was required to provide public \nnotice and opportunity for comment before implementing this significant, prospective change. \n100.  The Refugee Funding Suspension thus violated the procedural requirements of \nthe APA.  To the extent the government might argue that the Rubio Memo or Foreign Aid Ex-\necutive Order independently justify or require the Refugee Funding Suspension, the Rubio \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465     Document 1     Filed 02/18/25     Page 34 of 35\nMemo and agency actions implementing the Foreign Aid Executive Order are unlawful for the \nsame reasons and should be set aside. \n101.  The Refugee Funding Suspension, including the suspension of reimbursements \nfor pre-January 24 expenses and for ongoing expenses pursuant to USCCB’s cooperative agree-\nments, should be declared unlawful and set aside, as should the Rubio Memo to the extent it \napplies to USCCB.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706.  Defendants and all persons acting in concert with \nthem should be enjoined from enforcing, implementing, or in any manner giving effect to the \nRefugee Funding Suspension—and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Rubio Memo and \nForeign Aid Executive Order.  See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court: \n1.  Declare that the Refugee Funding Suspension (and, to the extent they apply to \nUSCCB, the Rubio Memo and actions implementing the Foreign Aid Executive \nOrder) violate the Refugee Act of 1980, the Impoundment Control Act, and the \nseparation of powers; are arbitrary and capricious under the APA; and are sub-\nstantive rules that did not comply with the procedural requirements of the APA; \n2.  Hold unlawful and set aside the Refugee Funding Suspension (and, to the extent \nit applies to USCCB, the Rubio Memo);  \n3.  Enjoin—temporarily, preliminarily, and permanently—Defendants from taking \nany action enforcing or implementing against USCCB the Refugee Funding Sus-\npension, Rubio Memo, or Foreign Aid Executive Order;  \n4.

But the district court lacks jurisdiction over these contract \nclaims. The district court thus properly concluded that plaintiff was not \nentitled to a preliminary injunction requiring the government to make \npayments that would be owed under agreements that the government has \nelected to terminate. \nIn its motion before this Court, plaintiff seeks to emphasize arguments \nthat are, at best, tangential to the contract claim that allegedly gives rise to \nirreparable injury and the right to an injunction. Those repackaged \narguments provide no basis for concluding that the district court abused its \ndiscretion in denying a motion for a preliminary injunction. None of them can \nescape the fact that plaintiff’s only cognizable interest is in seeking payments \nfrom the federal government under its cooperative agreement. No statute or \nregulation even arguably requires the government to provide money to \nplaintiff, and plaintiff has no other cognizable interest in enforcing the \nvarious statutes it has invoked. The motion for an injunction pending appeal \nshould be denied. \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 3 of 29\nSTATEMENT \n1. Congress has authorized the President to determine annually how \nmany refugees may be admitted to the United States based on \n“humanitarian concerns” and “the national interest.” 8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2). \nAfter refugees are admitted, the United States provides services to enable \ntheir “effective resettlement” and “to assist them to achieve economic self-\nsufficiency as quickly as possible.” 45 C.F.R. § 400.1(a).  \nTo administer those services, Congress established the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement within the Department of Health and Human \nServices. See 8 U.S.C. § 1521. That Office’s Director is authorized to \nprovide—directly or through grants and contracts with third parties—\nvarious resettlement services. See id. § 1522(c)-(e); see generally 45 C.F.R. pt. \n400.  \nIn addition, Congress “authorized” the Secretary of State to “make \ngrants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for initial \nresettlement” of “refugees in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1522(b)(1)(A).1 \n \n1 The statute authorizes the Director to make such grants and \ncontracts but allows the President to designate a different officer, see 8 \nU.S.C. § 1522(b)(1)(A)-(B), and the President has designated the Secretary of \nState, see 17 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents 2880 (Jan. 13, \n1981). \n2 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 4 of 29\nThe Secretary has entered into cooperative agreements with partners to \nprovide initial resettlement services, which last between thirty and ninety \ndays. See Dkt. No. 25-1, at 3-4. \nCongress has appropriated funds to the State Department for various \n“refugee and migration needs,” including resettlement programs. Dkt. No. \n14-1, at 9; see Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, div. F, Pub. L. \nNo. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 729. In March 2024, Congress appropriated a lump \nsum of $3,928,000,000 “to remain available until expended” for a wide variety \nof refugee and migration expenses, most of which are not at issue here, but \nwhich include “activities to meet refugee and migration needs.” 138 Stat. at \n744.  \nFinally, Congress has determined that, in “providing assistance under” \nresettlement programs, the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n“shall, to the extent of available appropriations,” prioritize certain goals. \n8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A). In particular, the Director shall “make available \nsufficient resources for employment training and placement in order to \nachieve economic self-sufficiency among refugees as quickly as possible,” \n“provide refugees with the opportunity to acquire sufficient English \nlanguage training to enable them to become effectively resettled as quickly \n3 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 5 of 29\nas possible,” “insure that cash assistance is made available to refugees in \nsuch a manner as not to discourage their economic self-sufficiency,” and \n“insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate in \ntraining and instruction.” Id. \n2. The State Department entered into two cooperative agreements with \nplaintiff to provide initial resettlement services during the current fiscal \nyear. These agreements require plaintiff to provide, for the initial 90-day \nperiod, specified “core services” to refugees “who are assigned to” plaintiff. \nDkt. No. 5-4, at 19, 38-57; see also Dkt. No. 5-5, at 19, 38-57. Plaintiff was \nassigned approximately 8,000 refugees between October 1, 2024, and \nJanuary 24, 2025. See Dkt. No. 25-1, at 5-6. As of today, fewer than 3,000 of \nthose assigned refugees remain within the 90-day initial resettlement period. \nSee id. Ex. 1.  \n3. On January 20, 2025, the President issued two Executive Orders \nrelevant here. First, Executive Order No. 14,163, 90 Fed. Reg. 8459 (Jan. 20, \n2025), titled Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program, \nreflects the President’s determination that the “United States lacks the \nability to absorb large numbers of migrants” and refugees “in a manner that \ndoes not compromise the availability of resources for Americans.” Id. § 1. \n4 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 6 of 29\nThe Executive Order declares that it is the “policy of the United States” to, \namong other things, “ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer \nresources for its citizens.” Id. § 2. And the Executive Order generally \nsuspends admission of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions \nProgram. Id. § 3.  \nSecond, Executive Order No. 14,169, 90 Fed. Reg. 8619 (Jan. 30, 2025), \ntitled Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, states that \nforeign assistance funds “are not aligned with American interests and in \nmany cases antithetical to American values” in ways that “serve to \ndestabilize world peace.” Id. § 1. The Executive Order declares that “[i]t is \nthe policy of United States that no further United States foreign assistance \nshall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy \nof the President.” Id. § 2. To provide time to review foreign assistance \nprograms “for programmatic efficiency and consistency with United States \nforeign policy,” the Executive Order directs agencies to “immediately pause \nnew obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds to \nforeign countries” and implementing organizations and contractors. Id. \n§ 3(a). The Secretary of State has authority to waive the pause. Id. § 3(d), (e). \n5 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 7 of 29\nConsistent with that Executive Order, the Secretary of State issued a \nmemorandum directing a pause on foreign assistance programs funded by or \nthrough the State Department. See App.22. The Secretary has approved \nvarious waivers of that pause, including for legitimate expenses incurred \nbefore the pause went into effect and legitimate expenses associated with \nstop-work orders. See id. \nFollowing those Executive Orders and the Secretary’s memorandum, \non January 24, the Department informed plaintiff that it was “immediately \nsuspend[ing]” the two cooperative agreements related to initial refugee \nresettlement. App.25. The Department explained that those agreements \n“may no longer effectuate agency priorities” and were thus suspended \n“pending a Department-wide review of foreign assistance programs.” Id. The \nDepartment thus directed plaintiff to “stop all work under the” agreements \nand “not incur any new costs.” Id.  \nOn February 26, following the Department’s review, it terminated both \nof plaintiff’s agreements. The Department explained that it had determined \nthat the agreements “no longer effectuat[e] agency priorities” and were thus \n“terminated in accordance with” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340. App. 77, 80; see also 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (providing that awards like the agreements here “may \n6 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 8 of 29\nbe terminated” by the agency “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the” \nagreement, “including, to the extent authorized by law, if” an agreement “no \nlonger effectuates the program goals or agency priorities”).   \n4. On February 18, plaintiff filed this suit and sought preliminary relief \nagainst the agreements’ suspension. See Dkt. No. 1. After the agreements \nwere terminated, plaintiff filed an amended complaint and an amended \npreliminary-injunction motion to challenge the terminations. See Dkt. Nos. \n29, 30.  \nAt a high level, plaintiff contends that the terminations are “contrary \nto various federal laws, including the Refugee Act of 1980 and the \nImpoundment Control Act,” and that they were “arbitrary and capricious, in \nviolation of the” APA. App.7. As relief, plaintiff requested that the district \ncourt “enjoi[n]” the government from implementing any action “preventing \nthe obligation or disbursement of appropriated funds to provide refugee \nresettlement services.” Id. (quotation omitted). \nThe district court denied plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, \nconcluding that the “requested injunctive relief is incompatible with the \nGovernment’s sovereign immunity.” App.9. The court explained that district \ncourts generally do not have jurisdiction over claims against the United \n7 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 9 of 29\nStates “grounded in contract”—which generally must be brought to the \nCourt of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. Id. And the court concluded \nthat plaintiff’s requested preliminary injunction impermissibly “sounds in \ncontract.” App.10 (quotation omitted).  \nThe court explained that, “[s]tripped of its equitable flair,” plaintiff’s \n“requested relief seeks one thing”: an order requiring “the Government to \nstop withholding the money due under” plaintiff’s agreements. App.11. Thus, \nthe court concluded, plaintiff “seeks the classic contractual remedy of specific \nperformance.” App.11 (quoting Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, \n764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). And “an award of money due” is not a \nremedy that district courts—or “court[s] sitting in equity”—may generally \ngrant. App. 11-12. The court thus denied the motion.  \nPlaintiff appealed the district court’s denial and filed an emergency \nmotion for an injunction pending appeal.  \nARGUMENT \nTo obtain the “exceptional remedy of an injunction pending appeal,” a \nplaintiff “faces the difficult task of coming forward with evidence and \nargument showing that it is likely that the district court abused its discretion \nin denying a preliminary injunction.” John Doe Co. v. CFPB, 849 F.3d 1129, \n8 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 10 of 29\n1131 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (quotation and alteration omitted). A \npreliminary injunction, in turn, may only be awarded to a plaintiff who \ndemonstrates that “he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance \nof equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” \nId. (quotation omitted). \nA.  Plaintiff Is Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Its \nRequest for an Injunction  \n1. In district court, plaintiff requested a preliminary injunction that \nwould primarily have enjoined defendants from “giving effect to” any agency \naction “preventing the obligation or disbursement of appropriated funds to \nprovide refugee resettlement services”—including specifically the suspension \nand terminations of plaintiff’s agreements. Dkt. No. 30-1. In other words, \nplaintiff sought an injunction requiring the government to continue \nreimbursing plaintiff for any services it provides pursuant to its agreements. \nAs the district court correctly recognized, that relief is jurisdictionally \nforbidden. \nAs a general rule, the federal government is “immune from suit in \nfederal court absent a clear and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.” \nCrowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 2022). And \n9 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 11 of 29\nalthough the APA provides “a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims against the United States” seeking non-monetary relief, id., that \nwaiver does not apply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit \nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought,” Match-E-Be-Nash-\nShe-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 215 (2012). \n(quotation omitted). That carve-out “prevents plaintiffs from exploiting the \nAPA’s waiver to evade limitations on suit contained in other statutes.” Id.  \nIn particular, when a party seeks to access funding that it believes the \ngovernment is obligated to pay under a contract or grant, the proper remedy \nis typically suit under the Tucker Act, not the APA. The Tucker Act provides \nthat the “United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to \nrender judgment upon any claim against the United States founded” on “any \nexpress or implied contract”—including agreements like those that plaintiff \nhad—“with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a). As this Court has \nexplained, “the Tucker Act impliedly forbids” the bringing of “contract \nactions” against “the government in a federal district court” under the APA. \nAlbrecht v. Committee on Employee Benefits of the Federal Reserve \nEmployee Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quotation \nomitted). \n10 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 12 of 29\nIn determining whether “a particular action” is “at its essence a \ncontract action” subject to the Tucker Act or instead a challenge properly \nbrought under the APA, this Court looks at both “the source of the rights \nupon which the plaintiff bases its claims” and “the type of relief sought (or \nappropriate).” Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982) \n(quotation omitted). In this case, both of those considerations make clear that \nplaintiff may not receive the relief it seeks at this stage.  \nAs the district court correctly concluded, plaintiff’s requested relief is \nessentially contractual. As explained, plaintiff sought an order prohibiting \nthe government from preventing the disbursement of funds under its \nagreements. “Stripped of its equitable flair,” that relief “seeks one thing”: \nplaintiff “wants the Court to order the Government to stop withholding the \nmoney due under the” agreements. App.11. And stripped of the double \nnegative, plaintiff “wants the Government to keep paying up.” Id. But this is \n“the classic contractual remedy of specific performance.” Id. (quoting \nSpectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). \nPlaintiff’s requested injunction thus sounds in contract, as the district court \ncorrectly held. \n11 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 13 of 29\nThe source of plaintiff’s claimed right to the injunction reinforces the \ncourt’s conclusion. As is explained in more detail below, see infra p. 14, \nalthough plaintiff cites various statutes and regulations as relevant to this \ncase, even on plaintiff’s reading none of those statutes or regulations actually \nrequires the government to make payments to plaintiff. Instead, to the \nextent that the government is required to disburse funds to plaintiff, it can \nonly be as a result of plaintiff’s agreements—not as a result of any statute or \nregulation. \nThis case is thus much like Spectrum, as the district court recognized. \nThere, a government contractor encountered difficulties performing the \ncontract; the government invoked a liquidated damages provision and, as a \nresult, withheld payments under the contract. Spectrum, 764 F.2d at 892. \nThe contractor sued, claiming that the government had violated statutory \nprocedures in withholding the payments. Id. This Court held that the suit \nhad to go to the Court of Federal Claims. This Court explained that the \nplaintiff sought “an injunction requiring the government to pay monies \nowed” and that the “right to these payments is created in the first instance \nby the contract, not by the” relevant statute. Id. at 894. In other words, the \nstatute “confers no such right in the absence of the contract itself.” Id. The \n12 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 14 of 29\nrequested remedy was thus “the classic contractual remedy of specific \nperformance.” Id.  \nSo too here. Plaintiff apparently seeks an injunction requiring the \ngovernment to continue reimbursing plaintiff under the agreements. And the \nagreements themselves—not the Refugee Act, not the Impoundment Control \nAct, and not the APA—create the asserted right to payment in the first \ninstance. Plaintiff thus seeks an essentially contractual remedy on an \nessentially contractual claim, and its suit belongs in the Court of Federal \nClaims. \n2. Seemingly aware that it cannot ask the court to order the \ngovernment to make payments under an agreement, plaintiff seeks to recast \nits claim in other terms. But “Congress, in passing the Federal Courts \nImprovement Act, emphasized” that “it did not want federal court \njurisdiction to be manipulated by artful pleading.” Bembenista v. United \nStates, 866 F.2d 493, 497 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quotation omitted). Reframing its \nclaim as an argument about the government’s alleged “statutory obligation to \nprovide refugee resettlement assistance” or about the Impoundment Control \nAct, Mot.9-10, does not change that plaintiff is, at bottom, asking this Court \n13 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 15 of 29\nto order the government to make payments to plaintiff because—and only \nbecause—the government has entered into contracts with it.  \nEven under plaintiff’s reading of those statutes, they do no more than \nrequire the government to spend appropriated funds on certain refugee \nassistance activities. The Refugee Act authorizes the provision of certain \nservices and directs the government to prioritize certain goals. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1522. A broad State Department appropriation funds a wide variety of \n“refugee and migration needs,” including initial resettlement services, and is \navailable until expended, 138 Stat. at 744, thus making any argument about \nan impoundment irrelevant here. In short, none of the cited statutes—even in \nplaintiff’s telling—requires the government to provide funds to plaintiff \nspecifically. The only thing that even arguably does that is a contract that \nplaintiff cannot enforce in this Court. And plaintiff’s fleeting suggestion that \nthe government violated a regulation that prohibits “[p]ayments for \nallowable costs” from being “withheld,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6), only \nunderscores the fundamentally contractual nature of plaintiff’s claims. \nAt times, plaintiff acknowledges the incompatibility of its jurisdictional \ntheory with its actual claim, noting that the government “could choose to \nprovide the required assistance without reinstating the agreements.” Mot.11. \n14 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 16 of 29\nPerhaps a refugee could bring an APA claim challenging the failure to \nprovide assistance, but that has little to do with plaintiff’s efforts to obtain \npayment according to the terms of its agreements. Plaintiff’s only interest in \nthe provision of such assistance is the agreements themselves, placing this \ncase in stark contrast with National Helium Corp. v. Morton, 455 F.2d 650 \n(10th Cir. 1971), where the plaintiffs “exercised the same rights as would a \nthird party environmental group” and “the fact that they were also \ngovernment contractors was irrelevant.” Spectrum, 764 F.2d at 894 n.4. \nPlaintiff has no rights to exercise here other than its rights as the \ncounterparty to a contract. \nPlaintiff’s struggles to identify any cognizable interest other than \npayments under the agreements underscore the impropriety of the relief \nplaintiff actually seeks. Plaintiff contends that the requested injunction would \nconfer considerable value “independent of any future potential for non-\nmonetary relief” because it would “allo[w]” plaintiff “to fulfill its promise to \nrefugees placed in its care and carry out its mission to assist refugees.” \nMot.11 (quotation omitted). Similarly, plaintiff claims that equitable relief—\nnot “money damages”—is “the relief most important” for plaintiff, because \nonly that relief “can redress the ongoing harm to [plaintiff’s] mission as it is \n15 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 17 of 29\nprevented from assisting the refugees in its care.” Mot.12. As those \nstatements make clear, the value of the relief plaintiff seeks turns entirely on \nthat relief’s ability to ensure that the government pays plaintiff. The \ngovernment is not preventing plaintiff from providing services as it sees fit; \nthe government has just terminated the contracts under which the \ngovernment would provide reimbursement for those services. And the only \nharm to plaintiff’s mission is that it is not getting paid under the terms of the \nagreements. \n3. Plaintiff’s ostensible APA claims cannot serve as a stalking horse for \nthe contractual claims they actually wish to pursue. Regardless, for related \nreasons, they do not state a claim at all.  \nFirst, as explained, none of the statutory provisions cited by plaintiff \nrequires the government to fund resettlement services through payments to \nplaintiff. Indeed, plaintiff admits as much, conceding that Congress “gave the \ngovernment discretion over how to provide” refugee assistance. Mot.17. \nThus, even setting everything else aside, plaintiff’s request for an injunction \nrequiring the government to continue disbursing funds to plaintiff is not \njustified by plaintiff’s own claims.  \n16 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 18 of 29\nSecond, and relatedly, neither the Refugee Act nor the Impoundment \nControl Act confers rights on plaintiff that may be enforced through the \nAPA.  \nA plaintiff may not seek review under the APA if “statutes preclude \njudicial review.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1). The Supreme Court has accordingly \nrecognized that Congress can displace the APA’s default cause of action, \nincluding by constructing a detailed scheme that provides for review by only \nsome parties. See, e.g., Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, \n345-47 (1984). Similarly, to invoke the APA, a “plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury” it complains of “falls within the zone of interests sought to be \nprotected by the statutory provision” at issue. Air Courier Conference of Am. \nv. American Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 523 (1991) (quotation \nomitted). Where the plaintiff is not the object of a challenged regulatory \naction, the plaintiff has no right of review if its “interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it \ncannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.” \nClarke v. Securities Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987); cf. Lexmark Int’l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014). \n17 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 19 of 29\nNothing in the Refugee Act suggests that Congress intended to permit \nfunding recipients such as plaintiff to contest the Executive Branch’s \ndecisions regarding how to allocate appropriations across refugee and \nmigration programs. And Section 1522 specifically focuses on the interests of \nrefugees without evincing any desire to protect the interests of organizations \nlike plaintiff that provide assistance to those refugees. As Justice O’Connor \nexplained in granting the government’s stay application an immigration case, \norganizations that simply assist immigrants cannot satisfy the zone-of-\ninterests test because federal immigration law was “clearly meant to protect \nthe interests of undocumented aliens, not the interests of organizations.” INS \nv. Legalization Assistance Project of L.A. Cty. Fed’n of Labor, 510 U.S. 1301, \n1302 (1993) (O’Connor, J., in chambers). So too here. \nThe Impoundment Control Act is similarly unconcerned with plaintiff. \nThat statute is designed to regulate the relationship between Congress and \nthe Executive Branch. Congress did not contemplate private enforcement \nlawsuits, which would raise significant separation-of-powers concerns and \ninject courts into disputes that coordinate branches must work out among \nthemselves. Congress specified particular forms of legislative action to \naddress efforts to impound funds. 2 U.S.C. § 688. And to the extent that \n18 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 20 of 29\nCongress contemplated litigation, it provided for suits brought by the \nComptroller General, an official within the Legislative Branch. See id. § 687. \nRegardless whether such suits are cognizable under Article III and the \nseparation of powers, the statute does not contemplate enforcement through \nsuits by other parties under the APA.  \nThird, the extensive discretion reflected in the Refugee Act and the \nrelevant appropriation precludes application of the APA’s reasoned-\ndecisionmaking requirements in this case and demonstrates the legality of \nthe Department’s decision to terminate plaintiff’s access to funds. \nThe Department’s decision to terminate plaintiff’s agreements is \ncommitted to agency discretion by law. In Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 \n(1993), the Supreme Court held that the Indian Health Service’s decision to \ndiscontinue a program it had previously funded and to instead reallocate \nthose funds to other programs was committed to agency discretion by law \nand thus not reviewable under the APA’s reasoned-decisionmaking \nstandards. See id. at 185-88. The Court explained that the “allocation of funds \nfrom a lump-sum appropriation is” an “administrative decision traditionally \nregarded as committed to agency discretion,” because the “very point of a \nlump-sum appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to \n19 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 21 of 29\nchanging circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees \nas the most effective or desirable way.” Id. at 192.  \nThus, “an agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation \nrequires ‘a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly \nwithin its expertise’: whether its ‘resources are best spent’ on one program or \nanother; whether it ‘is likely to succeed’ in fulfilling its statutory mandate; \nwhether a particular program ‘best fits the agency’s overall policies’; and, \n‘indeed, whether the agency has enough resources’ to fund a program ‘at \nall.’” Id. at 193 (quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985)).  \n“Of course,” the Court went on, this discretion is not unbounded \nbecause “an agency is not free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities: \nCongress may always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by \nputting restrictions in the operative statutes.” 508 U.S. at 193. But as long as \nthe agency abides by the relevant statutes (and whatever self-imposed \nobligations may arise from regulations or funding instruments), the APA \n“gives the courts no leave to intrude.” Id.  \nAlthough Lincoln addressed lump-sum appropriations, this Court has \nmade clear that its logic extends to funding programs that leave to the \nagency “the decision about how the moneys” for a particular program “could \n20 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 22 of 29\nbest be distributed consistent with” the statute. Milk Train, Inc. v. \nVeneman, 310 F.3d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Such decisions—like decisions \nregarding how best to allocate lump-sum appropriations—“clearly require[] a \ncomplicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within [the \nagency’s] expertise.” Id. at 752 (quotation omitted). \nThat plainly describes the program at issue in this case. As explained, \nthe Secretary is responsible for allocating a single appropriation across a \nwide range of migration and refugee programs, with nothing in the \nappropriation to constrain the Secretary’s discretion regarding how to \nallocate those funds. And within the Refugee Act itself, the Director of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement and the Secretary of State together have \nwide discretion to determine which resettlement assistance programs to fund \nin order to achieve broad statutory goals such as ensuring economic self-\nsufficiency. See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1). Neither the appropriation nor the \nstatute meaningfully constrains the Secretary’s discretion to determine how \nbest to allocate funding among different programs or funding recipients. As a \nresult, the Secretary’s decision to award or terminate funding is \nreviewable—at most—only for compliance with the terms of the governing \n21 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 23 of 29\nstatutes, regulations, and funding instruments. Plaintiff errs in attempting to \nsubject the terminations to arbitrary-and-capricious review. \nFinally, that broad discretion also demonstrates the error in plaintiff’s \nstatutory arguments on the merits. Although the Refugee Act authorizes the \nSecretary to make grants for initial resettlement services and directs the \ngovernment to prioritize certain goals (to the extent that appropriations \nallow), nothing in the plain text of that statute requires the Secretary to fund \ninitial resettlement services at all, let alone to fund services through \nagreements with organizations like plaintiff. Instead, the statute provides the \ngovernment with broad discretion to allocate funding across many different \nresettlement assistance programs, including the single program at issue in \nthis case—and that discretion is magnified by the underlying appropriation, \nwhich provides the Secretary with unbounded discretion to allocate funds \nacross a wide range of migration and refugee activities. The decision to \nterminate funding for one authorized program among many thus does not \nviolate the statute. \nSimilarly, plaintiff’s suggestion that the termination of its agreements \nconstitutes an improper recission of budget authority under the \nImpoundment Control Act is unavailing. As explained, the relevant \n22 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 24 of 29\nappropriation covers a variety of programs and remains available until \nexpended. Plaintiff has identified no determination by the government not to \nobligate the full amount of the appropriation across the programs—much \nless has plaintiff identified any imminent risk of unobligated funds expiring. \nThere is nothing approaching a recission of budget authority in this case. \nB.  The Balance of Harms and Public Interest Also Preclude an \nInjunction Pending Appeal \nThe remedy that plaintiff seeks—an injunction forcing the government \nto expend taxpayer funds in ways that it has determined would contravene \nthe interests of the country—would work an extraordinary harm to the \nExecutive Branch. Plaintiff cannot seize for itself the discretionary \njudgments about allocating federal funds that belong to publicly accountable \nexecutive officials. \nThe separation-of-powers concerns posed by plaintiff’s proposed \ninjunction are magnified because the agreements at issue implicate the \nPresident’s Article II authority over foreign affairs. The President considers \n“humanitarian concerns” and “the national interest” in making decisions \nabout refugee admissions. 8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2). The Secretary of State in \nturn has authority to enter cooperative agreements to provide temporary \nresettlement services to refugees who enter this country. Id. § 1522(b)(1)(A). \n23 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 25 of 29\nAnd the President has issued multiple Executive Orders declaring national \npolicy on these foreign-relations matters. Plaintiff’s request threatens to \ndisable the President from effectuating his foreign-policy agenda and to \ndisrupt considered judgments about the extent of resources to devote to \nindividuals arriving from foreign countries. See United States v. Curtiss-\nWright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936) (describing “the very delicate, \nplenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal \ngovernment in the field of international relations”). \nThe government would face irreparable harm if plaintiff’s motion were \ngranted. If the government’s position that the district court properly denied \na preliminary injunction is later vindicated in this appeal, there would be no \nguarantee that the funds disbursed in the interim could be retrieved from \nplaintiff or its “dozens of subrecipient agencies across the country,” App.37, \nafter the fact. At a minimum, plaintiff would need to post security to obtain \nthe injunctive relief it seeks. Absent such a bond, the government lacks \nadequate assurance about recovering any wrongfully disbursed taxpayer \nfunds. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) (“The court may issue a preliminary \ninjunction . . . only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court \n24 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 26 of 29\nconsiders proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found \nto have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”). \nOn the other hand, plaintiff asserts monetary harms from the \ngovernment’s alleged failure to pay money due. In plaintiff’s own telling, it \n“is short millions of dollars in unpaid reimbursements for services already \nrendered and is accruing millions more each week—with no indication the \ngovernment will fund any additional services.” Mot.5-6. Although plaintiff \ntries to recast these harms as damage to its reputation and ability to offer \nservices, see Mot.24-27, its motion focuses on the need to compensate \nemployees, Mot.24, and “to reimburse” subrecipients, Mot.25. The upshot is \nthat plaintiff’s harms are pecuniary in nature and can be remedied by a \nmoney judgment in the ordinary course and in the appropriate forum, in the \nevent that plaintiff does not receive the funds to which it is entitled without \nfurther litigation. \nPlaintiff has no cognizable interest in receiving federal funds to which \nit is not legally entitled or on a timeline that is not legally compelled. With \nrespect to work completed before suspension, we are informed that the State \nDepartment has been processing outstanding payments, including a recent \npayment of over $1.5 million to plaintiff. To the extent that plaintiff has a \n25 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 27 of 29\ncognizable legal dispute about whether it is entitled to other payments within \na specific timeframe, it is free to bring such a claim as part of a Tucker Act \nsuit. See Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296, 327 \n(2020) (explaining that claims over “specific sums already calculated, past \ndue, and designed to compensate for completed labors” “lie[] in the Tucker \nAct’s heartland”).2 \n \n \n   \n \n2 In its motion, plaintiff makes a fleeting request “for expedited \nconsideration of the appeal” but proposes no schedule. Mot.2. To facilitate \nprompt consideration of this appeal, the government stands ready to submit \nits appellate brief within 30 days after plaintiff files its opening brief. The \ngovernment believes that this schedule is adequate to ensure resolution of \nthe appeal in a timely manner but defers to the Court on an appropriate \nbriefing schedule. \n26 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5066      Document #2106955            Filed: 03/21/2025      Page 28 of 29\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the motion for an \ninjunction pending appeal. \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

For nearly 80 years, the Catholic Church has been caring for refugees within the \nUnited States.  Refugees face significant challenges upon entering the country, including locat-\ning housing, learning English, and finding employment.  The Church has long helped to ease \nthose burdens and integrate refugees into American society by providing shelter, clothing, food, \nand training.  This work is an expression of charity taken in fulfillment of Christ’s command-\nment to serve those in need, regardless of their race, creed, or color. \n2.  Since 1980, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and its predeces-\nsor organization, the U.S. Catholic Conference, (“USCCB” or the “Conference”) have expanded \nthat mission in partnership with the federal government through the U.S. Refugee Admissions \nProgram.  It “is the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons \nsubject to persecution in their homelands” by providing “transitional assistance to refugees in \nthe United States.”  Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, § 101, 94 Stat. 102, 102.  The \nfederal government carries out this transitional assistance through the Bureau of Population, \nRefugees, and Migration (“PRM”), which is a component of the Department of State.  USCCB \nhas partnered with the federal government in this work for nearly half a century, under admin-\nistrations of both parties and with the support of repeated and ongoing congressional appropri-\nations. \n3.  The beneficiaries of this cooperative partnership are refugees who are fleeing \npersecution, instability, and oppression and have come to the United States as a place of refuge \nand hope.  These refugees are vetted and approved by the federal government before entering \nthe country and now are in the United States legally.  Once here, they are entitled by statute to \nreceive federal funds for their initial period of resettlement—transitional support for no more \nthan their first 90 days in the United States, which is essential to helping them establish a new \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 3 of 41\nhome.  This transitional assistance promotes the successful settlement of refugees in their com-\nmunities, including by promoting gainful employment or connections to educational opportuni-\nties, thereby diminishing the likelihood that newly arriving refugees will be dependent on on-\ngoing public support. \n4.  PRM funds these refugee resettlement programs through annual cooperative \nagreements with organizations like USCCB.  Under USCCB’s current cooperative agreements, \nPRM committed to provide around $65 million in federal funding for the immediate physical \nneeds and integration of refugees into their new communities.  In coordination with local Cath-\nolic Charities and other subrecipients, USCCB uses these funds to care for thousands of refugees \nin the United States.  USCCB and its subrecipients provide food, shelter, job training, and Eng-\nlish-language education in order to help refugees integrate and become self-sufficient as quickly \nas possible.  USCCB spends more on refugee resettlement each year than it receives in funding \nfrom the federal government, but it cannot sustain its programs without the millions in federal \nfunding  that  provide  the  foundation  of  this  private-public  partnership.    For  decades,  the \nU.S. government has chosen to admit refugees and outsourced its statutory responsibility to pro-\nvide those refugees with resettlement assistance to non-profit organizations like USCCB.  But \nnow, after refugees have already arrived and been placed in USCCB’s care, the government is \nattempting to pull the rug out from under USCCB’s programs by halting funding.   \n5.  On January 24, 2025, without prior notice, the State Department suspended fund-\ning for refugee resettlement nationwide by issuing suspension letters to its resettlement partners \n(the “Refugee Funding Suspension”).  USCCB received a cursory, two-page letter from PRM \nnotifying the organization that its cooperative agreements were immediately suspended.  The \nsuspension letter’s only justifications were a reference to a recent Executive Order directing the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 4 of 41\nsuspension of funding for foreign aid and a vague suggestion that the awards may not be con-\nsistent with the State Department’s priorities.  Since the suspension, the State Department has \nnot made any payments to USCCB.  Although the suspension letter purported to allow reim-\nbursement for refugee-assistance work already completed before January 24, the State Depart-\nment has refused to reimburse USCCB for those expenses as well.  \n6.  After litigation commenced, the State Department pivoted toward complete ter-\nmination of the initial-resettlement program by canceling cooperative agreements with its reset-\ntlement partners (the “Refugee Funding Termination” or “Termination”).  On February 26, \n2025, USCCB received two one-page letters from the State Department notifying it that its co-\noperative agreements were terminated as of February 27, 2025.  The letters stated that the awards \nno longer effectuate agency priorities without explaining why.  The Department also asserted \nthat it is not obligated to pay for the costs USCCB and its subrecipients incurred while the sus-\npension was in effect.  Still, the State Department reiterated that it would reimburse USCCB for \nrefugee-assistance work completed before January 24th.  But the Department to date has refused \nto reimburse USCCB for any of its expenses. \n7.  The consequences of the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination have \nbeen predictably devastating for USCCB and the refugees it supports.  At the time of the sus-\npension, there were more than 6,700 refugees assigned to USCCB by the government that were \nstill within their 90-day transition period.  As of February 24, 2025, two days before the Termi-\nnation issued, more than 5,000 refugees assigned to USCCB remained eligible for initial-reset-\ntlement services.  As a direct result of the suspension and termination, USCCB has millions of \ndollars in pending, unpaid reimbursements for services already rendered to refugees and is ac-\ncruing millions more each week—with no indication that any future reimbursements will be \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 5 of 41\npaid.  USCCB has already been forced to initiate layoffs for fifty employees.  It faces irreparable \ndamage to its longstanding refugee resettlement programs and its reputation and relationship \nwith its subrecipients and the refugee populations it serves.  USCCB’s inability to reimburse its \npartner organizations, in turn, has required some of those organizations to lay off staff and stop \nproviding aid for housing, food, and resettlement support to refugees.  Refugees who have al-\nready entered the United States have been or may soon be cut off from support, contravening \nthe statutorily expressed will of Congress and making it more difficult for them to establish \nthemselves as productive members of society. \n8.  The government’s sudden Refugee Funding Suspension and subsequent Termi-\nnation are unlawful.  They violate multiple statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”), and undermine the Constitution’s separation of powers. \n9.  First, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination contravene appropria-\ntions-related statutes and flout the Constitution’s vesting of the power of the purse in Congress.  \nCongress has appropriated specific sums of money for refugee assistance and resettlement to \nremain available until expended, and it has mandated that the government provide prompt and \nadequate funding for the initial resettlement of refugees that the government has admitted and \nassigned to agencies like USCCB.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)–(b).  Given the continuing availabil-\nity of appropriations, the Executive Branch cannot unilaterally and indefinitely refuse to fund \nthose statutorily mandated services.  See Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 41–44 (1975).  \nIn addition, the Impoundment Control Act sets forth specific procedural and substantive require-\nments for Executive Branch attempts to delay or rescind spending of appropriated funds—re-\nquirements that were not satisfied by the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination.  \n2 U.S.C. § 684.  The suspension and termination therefore exceed the government’s statutory \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 6 of 41\nauthority.  By ignoring Congress’s appropriations decisions, moreover, the suspension and ter-\nmination undermine the Constitution’s separation of powers, which provides that Congress, not \nthe Executive Branch, decides how public funds shall be spent. \n10.  Second, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  For the first time in forty-five years, and without warning, the government has cut off \nfunding to USCCB for the essential services USCCB provides to government-approved refu-\ngees, including refugees already placed with USCCB and its subrecipients.  In doing so, the \ngovernment entirely failed to consider and address the obvious and catastrophic consequences \nthat an immediate funding suspension or termination would impose on USCCB, its subrecipi-\nents, and individual refugees—let alone those parties’ significant, reasonable reliance interests \nin continued funding.  Nor did it consider the obvious, less-disruptive alternatives of either re-\nviewing its outstanding agreements before halting funds to active awardees or continuing fund-\ning for refugees already present in the United States while winding down the program.  \n11.  The reasons the government did provide for its actions only heighten the suspen-\nsion’s and termination’s arbitrariness.  Although the suspension letter mentioned in passing an \nExecutive Order pausing foreign aid, that Executive Order on its face does not apply to \nUSCCB’s cooperative agreements, which exclusively provide “domestic assistance” to govern-\nment-vetted refugees located in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(3) (emphasis added).  \nAnd the suspension letter’s nebulous reference to the State Department’s policy priorities did \nnothing to explain why USCCB’s agreements—suddenly after decades of continuity—might be \ninconsistent with those priorities.  The termination letters’ one-sentence “conclusion” that the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 7 of 41\nawards are inconsistent with agency priorities did nothing to remedy that defect.  The govern-\nment also has given no explanation for its tacit refusal to reimburse pre-January 24 expenses \nunder USCCB’s cooperative agreements.   \n12.  Third, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are unlawful because \nthey were implemented without public notice and opportunity to comment.  5 U.S.C. § 553.  The \nsuspension and termination are legislative or substantive rules because they prospectively alter \nthe legal rights or interests of USCCB and thousands of refugees already present in the United \nStates.  Yet the government did not provide notice to or solicit input from affected parties and \nthe public at large, as the APA requires.   \n13.  The government’s suspension and termination of funds that USCCB spends on \ninitial refugee-resettlement services under its cooperative agreements with the State Department \nare unlawful.  This Court should declare Defendants’ actions unlawful and set them aside and \nenjoin Defendants from implementing, enforcing, or otherwise giving effect to the Refugee \nFunding Suspension, Termination, or similar actions so that USCCB’s vital work assisting law-\nfully admitted refugees may continue.  \nPARTIES \n14.

The Catholic Church has cared for refugees since the earliest days of Christianity.  \nSee The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and the Catholic Church, USCCB Off. of Pol’y & \nAdvoc. (Jan. 26, 2025), https://perma.cc/D7FC-WKKL; Pope Pius XII, Apostolic Constitution, \nExsul Familia Nazarethana (1952) (the Catholic Church is devoted to caring for refugees be-\ncause the Holy Family’s emigration to Egypt serves as “the archetype of every refugee family”).  \nThe “duty of giving foreigners a hospitable reception” is “imposed by human solidarity and by \nChristian  charity.”    Pope  Paul  VI,  Populorum  Progressio  (Mar.  26,  1967), \nhttps://perma.cc/N36H-3FSX.  “Jesus Christ, loving everyone with a universal love, educates \nus in the permanent recognition of the dignity of every human being, without exception.”  Letter \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 10 of 41\nof the Holy Father Francis to the Bishops of the United States of America (Feb. 10, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/38MM-RR4Z. \n26.  In the United States specifically, the Church’s refugee-resettlement efforts long \npredate its partnership with the federal government.  The Church first coordinated large-scale \nefforts to receive and integrate those displaced by World War II in dioceses across the United \nStates, and later welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing communist persecution in \nthe Soviet Union, Hungary, Vietnam, and Cuba.  See Catholic Ministries Serving Migrants and \nRefugees, USCCB (last visited Feb. 14, 2025), https://perma.cc/ZSD8-879C.   \n27.  Since 1965, USCCB has carried out this institutional mission in the United \nStates.  USCCB does so not because the refugees are Catholic (many are not), “but because we \nare Catholic.”  Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, Setting the record straight, Chicago Catholic (Feb. 5, \n2025), https://perma.cc/TZM6-VBZ4.  In this way, USCCB discharges the mandate of the Gos-\npel:  “I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and \nyou welcomed me.”  Id. (quoting Matthew 25:35). \nII.  Congress Has Required Funding For Resettlement Of Admitted Refugees For \nDecades \n28.  For more than sixty years, Congress likewise has recognized that refugee assis-\ntance and resettlement is not just a moral imperative, but also is essential to this country’s inter-\nests.  In 1962, in response to the increase of refugees fleeing communist countries, Congress \npassed the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, which authorized the appropriation of funds \nto address “urgent refugee and migration needs.”  Pub. L. No. 87-510, 76 Stat. 121, 122 (1962) \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 11 of 41\n(codified as amended at 22 U.S.C. § 2601(c)); see also Refugee Timeline, USCIS (last updated \nJan. 24, 2025), https://perma.cc/F8PM-H27V.  \n29.  In 1980, Congress enacted the Refugee Act, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 \n(1980) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1521 et seq.).  That Act declared that “it is the historic policy of \nthe United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their home-\nlands,” including through “efforts to promote opportunities for resettlement.”  Refugee Act of \n1980, § 101, 94 Stat. at 102.  Consistent with that purpose, the Refugee Act of 1980 created a \nstatutory framework for the admission and resettlement of refugees known as the U.S. Refugee \nAdmissions Program.    \n30.  Under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, individuals outside the United \nStates who have been persecuted or fear persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or \ncertain  other  grounds  can  seek  legal  admission  into  the  United  States.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§§ 1101(a)(42), 1157(c).  Refugees are screened abroad for eligibility and admissibility—a rig-\norous process that involves security and biometric checks, interviews, and medical screening, \namong other things.  Refugee Processing and Security Screening, USCIS (last visited Feb. 14, \n2025), https://perma.cc/4A8C-EQRZ.  If approved as refugees, the individuals are admitted into \nthe United States.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1157(c)(1), 1181(c).  The President determines the maximum \nnumber of refugees to be admitted each fiscal year.  Id. § 1157(a)(2), (3).  Since 1990, around \n65,000 refugees have been admitted per year on average.  Off. of Homeland Sec. Stat., Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., Refugees: 2023, at 4 (Nov. 2024), https://perma.cc/8NAF-ST46. \n31.  A core component of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is federal funding \nfor “domestic assistance” for the resettlement of newly arrived refugees, in partnership with \nprivate non-profit organizations.  8 U.S.C. § 1522.  Rather than rely entirely on private charitable \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 12 of 41\norganizations to provide resettlement assistance, Congress made it the “policy of the United \nStates” to commit federal funds in order to “promote opportunities for [refugee] resettlement.”  \nRefugee Act of 1980, § 101, 94 Stat. at 102.   \n32.  Although refugee resettlement is multifaceted, the resettlement program at issue \nhere is the “[p]rogram of initial resettlement.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b).  Under that program, the \nSecretary of State has been designated by the President to “make grants to, and contracts with, \npublic or private nonprofit agencies for initial resettlement . . . of refugees in the United States.”  \nId. § 1522(b)(1)(A), (B); see also HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 319 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021) \n(“Since 1981, the Department of State has overseen the program.”).  Congress has made the \nsame funding available for special immigrant visa holders from Afghanistan—i.e., those who \nassisted the U.S. Mission in Afghanistan and fear reprisals as a result.1  See Afghan Allies Pro-\ntection Act, § 602(b)(8), Pub. L. No. 111-8, 123 Stat. 807, 809 (2009) (codified in the notes of \n8 U.S.C. § 1101). \n33.  The Secretary of State has charged PRM with administering the initial-resettle-\nment program.  PRM discharges that responsibility by entering into annual cooperative agree-\nments with resettlement agencies.  As of February 25, 2025, there were ten resettlement agen-\ncies, including USCCB.  United States Refugee Admissions Program Flowchart, USCIS & Bu-\nreau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (Sept. 18, 2024), https://perma.cc/F5PJ-ZV3X.  \nUnder the cooperative agreements, PRM awards specific sums to each resettlement agency to \nreimburse expenses the agency incurs supporting refugees for up to the first 90 days they are in \nthe United States.  This funding covers critical services, such as housing, food, clothing, and \n \n1 For simplicity, this complaint refers to special immigrant visa holders and refugees collectively \nas “refugees.”   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 13 of 41\nassistance with access to social, medical, educational, and employment services.  The State De-\npartment’s payments to USCCB under the cooperative agreements are made through the De-\npartment of Health and Human Services’ Payment Management System.   \n34.  The government has a statutory obligation to provide adequate initial-resettle-\nment funding for admitted refugees “to the extent of available appropriations.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1522(a)(1)(A).2  In particular, and among other things, the agency “shall, to the extent of \navailable appropriations”: (1) “make available sufficient resources for employment training and \nplacement in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency among refugees as quickly as possible”; \nand (2) “provide refugees with the opportunity to acquire sufficient English language training \nto enable them to become effectively resettled as quickly as possible.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n35.  Consistent with those statutory commands, State Department regulations provide \nthat “[p]ayments for allowable costs” incurred by resettlement agencies “must not be with-\nheld . . . unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or” if the “recipient or subrecipient has \nfailed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt.”  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) (OMB regulations incorporated by reference into the State Depart-\nment’s federal award regulations at 2 C.F.R. § 600.101).  The State Department must reimburse \n \n2 Although Section 1522(a) names the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the De-\npartment of Health and Human Services, the Director’s statutory obligations with respect to initial \nresettlement have been transferred by presidential designation to the Secretary of State (and dele-\ngated to PRM) under Section 1522(b).  See Letter from President Jimmy Carter to Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, 3 Public Papers of President Carter 2879 (Jan. 13, 1981) (“In accordance \nwith Section 412(b)(1)(B) of the Refugee Act of 1980 . . . I have determined that the administration \nof the Reception and Placement grants, awarded to resettlement agencies for the performance of \ncertain initial services for refugees coming to the United States, should be retained by the Depart-\nment of State.”).  The Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Kennedy are \nnamed as defendants out of an abundance of caution, because HHS’s Payment Management Sys-\ntem is used to make payments to USCCB.  So too with Acting Director Harper, to the extent that \nthe government argues that she, not the Secretary of State, is responsible for providing initial re-\nsettlement assistance to refugees in USCCB’s care.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 14 of 41\nits resettlement agencies for expenses incurred “within 30 calendar days after receipt of the \npayment request[s].”  Id. § 200.305(b)(3).  \n36.  Similarly, the State Department must abide by certain regulations if it wishes to \nend its relationship with a refugee-resettlement agency.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340.  For example, \nthe Department may terminate a cooperative agreement if it concludes that the “award no longer \neffectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” but only if it does so “pursuant to the terms \nand conditions” of the award and “to the extent authorized by law.”  Id. § 200.340(a)(4).  \n37.  For decades, on a bipartisan basis, Congress has consistently appropriated funds \nfor refugee resettlement.  In 1985, for example, Congress appropriated $344,730,000 annually \nto the State Department for “Migration and Refugee Assistance.”  Foreign Relations Authoriza-\ntion Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-93, § 101, 99 Stat. 405, 407 (1985); see \nalso Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-236, \n§ 104, 108 Stat. 382, 390 (1994) (appropriating about $590,000,000 for the same); Department \nof State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. L. No. 113-\n235, 128 Stat. 2573, 2589 (2014) (appropriating $931,886,000 for the same); Additional Af-\nghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-43, 135 Stat. 372, 375 \n(2021) (appropriating $415,000,000 for fiscal year 2022 to “address humanitarian needs in, and \nto assist refugees from, Afghanistan”).  \n38.  Congress’s most recent appropriations have been no different.  In 2024, Congress \nappropriated $3,928,000,000 to implement, among other things, “the Migration and Refugee \nAssistance Act of 1962 . . . and other activities to meet refugee and migration needs.”  Depart-\nment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 15 of 41\nNo. 118-47, 138 Stat. 729, 744 (2024); see also, e.g., Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Ap-\npropriations Act, 2022, 135 Stat. at 374–75 (appropriating $976,100,000 for special immigrant \nvisa holders from Afghanistan, among other things). \n39.  Independent of the statutory scheme requiring the government to adequately fund \ninitial resettlement for admitted refugees, Congress also has enacted the Impoundment Control \nAct.  See 2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.  That Act regulates the Executive Branch’s authority to “defer” \nthe spending of appropriated funds by imposing substantive limitations and procedural require-\nments.  Id. § 684.  Before the Executive Branch can defer the use of appropriated funds, the Act \nrequires the President to transmit a “special message” to both houses of Congress with specific \ndetails about the proposed deferral, including the amount to be deferred, the deferral’s duration, \n“the reasons for the proposed deferral,” and “the estimated fiscal, economic, and budgetary ef-\nfect” it will have.  Id. § 684(a).  The Act also denies the Executive Branch any authority to defer \nspending except for three specified reasons; it forbids deferrals based on policy disagreements \nwith Congress.  Id. § 684(b).  Moreover, the Act forbids the Executive Branch from “re-\nscind[ing]” spending that Congress has authorized unless the President transmits a message to \nCongress and Congress enacts a rescission bill.  Id. § 683.  \nIII.  USCCB’s Refugee-Resettlement Program And Cooperative Agreements \n40.  Each year since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, USCCB has entered \ninto agreements with the federal government to provide initial-resettlement services for refu-\ngees.  USCCB receives and coordinates the distribution of PRM awards for initial resettlement \nthrough its Migration & Refugee Service.  USCCB partners with subrecipients, most of whom \nare local Catholic Charities, across the United States to accomplish this work.  These partners \nare strategically chosen in concert with the State Department and state refugee coordinators to \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 16 of 41\nachieve goals such as partnering with subrecipients in locations that will facilitate family reuni-\nfication efforts.   \n41.  Today, USCCB runs the largest non-governmental refugee-resettlement program \nin  the  United  States.    Resettlement  Services,  USCCB  (last  visited  Feb.  14,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/2DPN-M47N.  USCCB currently serves approximately 17% of refugees being \nresettled in the United States.  And since 1980, USCCB has provided refugee-resettlement ser-\nvices to more than 930,000 refugees.  \n42.  In providing this assistance, USCCB has consistently devoted more resources \nthan it receives in related federal funding.  In 2023, for example, USCCB paid $4 million more \non its refugee-resettlement and related programs than it received from the federal government.  \nKPMG, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Affiliates: Consolidated Financial \nStatements with Supplemental Schedules, December 31, 2023 and 2022, at 30 (Aug. 16, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/59YQ-TH5L.  And those numbers do not account for the additional cash, in-\nkind contributions, or volunteer services provided by local Catholic Charities and other subre-\ncipients. \n43.  For Fiscal Year 2025, USCCB entered into two cooperative agreements with \nPRM awarding USCCB around $65 million for initial refugee resettlement.  One of the agree-\nments covers refugees; the other covers refugees and special immigrant visa holders from Af-\nghanistan, who are treated like refugees for initial-resettlement purposes.  In all other relevant \nrespects, the terms of the cooperative agreements are materially identical.  Both cooperative \nagreements run from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.   \n44.  Both cooperative agreements require USCCB to “[a]ssume responsibility for \nsponsorship of the refugees assigned to” it “under this agreement.”  On the day a refugee is \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 17 of 41\nadmitted, USCCB must ensure that each refugee is met at the airport, transported to their home, \nand provided a first meal as well as food and clothing for their immediate needs.  USCCB also \nmust ensure that “refugees assigned to it” are provided the required home visits within 72 hours \nof arrival, and that the housing provided to the refugees is safe, sanitary, and adequately fur-\nnished.  USCCB must then assist refugees with, among other things, applications for social se-\ncurity cards, health insurance and medical care, English-language programs, cultural orienta-\ntion, and employment services during the first 90 days they are in the United States.   \nIV.  The President And Secretary Of State Issued Orders Suspending Foreign Aid and \nRefugee Admissions \n45.  Starting on January 20, 2025, both the President and the Secretary of State issued \norders suspending foreign aid and refugee admissions into the United States.  But none of those \norders expressly suspends funding for the resettlement of admitted refugees. \n46.  On January 20, President Trump signed an executive order titled “Reevaluating \nand Realigning United States Foreign Aid.”  Exec. Order No. 14,169, 90 Fed. Reg. 8619 \n(Jan. 20, 2025) (“Foreign Aid Executive Order”).  The Foreign Aid Executive Order directs \nrelevant Executive Branch officials to institute a “90-day pause in United States foreign devel-\nopment assistance” pending review for programmatic efficiency and policy alignment, subject \nto waivers authorized by the Secretary of State for specific programs.  Id. § 3(a).  On the same \nday, President Trump signed an executive order titled “Realigning the United States Refugee \nAdmissions Program.”  Exec. Order No. 14,163, 90 Fed. Reg. 8459 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“Refugee \nExecutive Order”).  The Refugee Executive Order suspends the entry of new refugees into the \nUnited States with narrow exceptions.  \n47.  On January 24, Secretary of State Rubio issued an order to all State Department \ndiplomatic and consular posts stating that “[c]onsistent with” the Foreign Aid Executive Order, \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 18 of 41\n“all new obligations of funding . . . for foreign assistance programs funded by or through the \nDepartment and USAID” would be paused “pending a review.”  Memorandum from Secretary \nof  State  to  All  Diplomatic  and  Consular  Posts,  Dep’t  of  State  (Jan.  24,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/J26T-VCJR (“Rubio Memo”).  The Rubio Memo instructed that for “existing \nforeign assistance awards, contracting officers and grant officers shall immediately issue stop-\nwork orders, consistent with the terms of the relevant award, until such time as the Secretary \nshall determine, following a review.”  Id.  The Rubio Memo also provided for waivers for lim-\nited circumstances.  Id. \nV.  The Government Abruptly Suspended Funding For Refugee Resettlement  \n48.  Although none of the President’s or Secretary of State’s orders mentions (let \nalone pauses) funding for the resettlement of refugees already admitted into the United States, \nthe State Department decided suddenly to suspend refugee-resettlement funding as well (the \n“Refugee Funding Suspension”).  \n49.  On January 24, on information and belief, PRM sent materially identical suspen-\nsion letters to its resettlement agencies, including USCCB.  See, e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 196–97, \nPacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-255 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 10, 2025).   \n50.  The two-page suspension letter USCCB received stated that “consistent with” \nthe Foreign Aid Executive Order, awards pursuant to USCCB’s cooperative agreements with \nthe State Department were “immediately suspended as of January 24, 2025” “pending a Depart-\nment-wide review of foreign assistance programs.”  Ex. A (“Suspension Letter”).  The suspen-\nsion letter instructed that immediately upon receipt, USCCB “must stop all work under the \naward(s) and not incur any new costs after” January 24 and “cancel as many outstanding obli-\ngations as possible.”  Id.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 19 of 41\n51.  The suspension letter provided only two perfunctory reasons for the sudden sus-\npension.  First, the order stated that the suspension was “[c]onsistent with the President’s Exec-\nutive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” without addressing \nhow domestic refugee resettlement constitutes foreign aid.  Id.  Second, the letter stated that the \naward to USCCB “may no longer effectuate agency priorities,” without addressing what the \nagency’s priorities are or why the awards may no longer effectuate those priorities.  Id.  The \nletter did not explain why the government had elected to suspend funding pending its reevalua-\ntion of priorities rather than conduct that review before cutting off funding midstream. \n52.  The suspension letter also stated that USCCB could “submit payment requests \nfor legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of” the letter “or legitimate expenses associated \nwith the” funding suspension.  Id.  But the government has thus far refused to reimburse USCCB \nfor more than $13 million in reimbursement funds for initial-resettlement services rendered be-\nfore January 24. \n53.  On January 28, USCCB responded to PRM.  USCCB explained that its resettle-\nment program services “includ[e] the provision of housing support, emergency food assistance, \nand emergency medical care to newly arrived refugees and Special Immigrant Visa (“SIV”) \nholders who have been processed and approved for resettlement in the United States by the \nfederal government.”  Ex. B.  USCCB urged that its programs were consistent with the “Ad-\nministration’s goals to make the United States safer and stronger, as it operates domestically to \nensure that newly arrived refugees and SIV holders are able to integrate successfully into local \ncommunities.”  Id.  USCCB also explained that it did not understand their awards to represent \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 20 of 41\n“new costs” and that the organization is entitled to reimbursement for all costs for serving “ref-\nugees and SIV holders in their initial 90-day . . . service periods.”  Id.  USCCB also inquired \nabout “legitimate expenses” it incurred before January 24, 2025.  Id.   \n54.  On January 31, 2025, in providing an update about payment requests, PRM stated \nthat the suspension was issued in order to “compl[y] with the [Foreign Aid] Executive Order.”  \nEx. C.  PRM also directed USCCB to “abide by the notice of suspension issued to [the] organi-\nzation.”  Id.   \nVI.  The Government Terminated Its Partnerships For Refugee Resettlement  \n55.  USCCB filed suit against the Defendants on February 18, 2024 and sought a \ntemporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  See Complaint, ECF No. 1; Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining and Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 5.  This Court denied USCCB’s \nmotion for a temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing to adjudicate USCCB’s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  ECF No. 15.   \n56.  While the litigation was ongoing, the State Department purported to terminate \nthe initial-resettlement program.  On February 26, 2025, two days before the preliminary in-\njunction hearing, the State Department issued two notices of termination to USCCB, cancelling \nits cooperative agreements to provide initial-resettlement services to the refugees the govern-\nment assigned to USCCB.   \n57.  On information and belief, the State Department sent materially identical termi-\nnation notices to its other resettlement agencies.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs’ Motion for Emergency \nConference or Show Cause Hearing at 1–2, Pacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-255 (W.D. Wash. Feb. \n27, 2025) (describing HIAS, Inc.’s and Church World Service, Inc.’s termination letters).  \n58.  The one-page letters USCCB received stated that the awards were “immediately \nterminated as of February 27, 2025.”  Ex. D; Ex. E (“Termination Letters”).  Like the suspension \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 21 of 41\nletter, the termination letters instructed that immediately upon receipt, USCCB “must stop all \nwork on the program and not incur any new costs” after February 27 and “cancel as many out-\nstanding obligations as possible.”  Ex. D; Ex. E.   \n59.  The termination letters provided a single reason for the termination—that the \ncooperative agreements “no longer effectuate[] agency priorities.”  Ex. D; Ex. E.  The letters \ndid not address what the State Department’s priorities are or why the awards no longer effectuate \nthose priorities.  Ex. D; Ex. E.  The letters did not explain why the government elected to cut \noff its relationship with USCCB “immediately” rather than giving USCCB a 90-day notice of \nimpending termination to allow the refugees assigned to USCCB’s care to graduate from the \nprogram.  Ex. D; Ex. E.   \n60.  The termination letters also revealed that the State Department views any initial-\nresettlement services USCCB provided to refugees between January 24 and February 27 as “new \ncosts.”  The termination letters stated that if USCCB’s awards were “already in suspended sta-\ntus,” only “payment requests for legitimate costs incurred prior to the effective date of the Notice \nof Suspension are allowable.”  Ex. D; Ex. E.  The termination letters thereby assumed that the \nsuspension letter operated to render post-January 24 expenses non-reimbursable.     \n61.  The termination letters repeated the State Department’s promise that “[p]ayment \nrequests for legitimate costs incurred prior to this notification are allowable.”  Ex. D; Ex. E.  But \nthe government has thus far refused to reimburse USCCB for more than $13 million in reim-\nbursement funds for initial-resettlement services rendered before January 24. \nVII.  The Refugee Funding Suspension Has Inflicted Swift And Irreparable Harm \n62.  On January 25, 2025, the day after USCCB received the suspension letter, there \nwere 6,758 refugees that had been assigned by the federal government to USCCB’s care and \nwho had been in the United States for 90 days or less.  As of February 24, 2025, two days before \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 22 of 41\nUSCCB received the termination letters, more than 5,000 refugees assigned to USCCB’s care \nremained eligible for initial-resettlement services.  \n63.  In the ordinary course, USCCB receives subrecipient reimbursement requests for \nrefugee-resettlement services rendered.  USCCB then pays its subrecipients for the refugee-\nresettlement services provided pursuant to the cooperative agreements and pays its own admin-\nistrative costs, operating costs, and the salaries of resettlement staff provided for in the agree-\nments.  Then, USCCB submits reimbursement requests for those costs to PRM’s grants office.  \nThose funds are typically available to USCCB within 24 to 48 hours.     \n64.  As a result of the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, however, \nUSCCB has not been reimbursed for services provided to the thousands of refugees that have \nbeen assigned to it.  USCCB has not been paid for services provided as far back as November \n2024, or for services rendered after January 24 to the refugees already allocated to USCCB’s \ncare for their initial-resettlement period.  USCCB is currently awaiting approximately $13 mil-\nlion of unpaid reimbursements and currently owes an additional $11.4 million to its subrecipi-\nents that it is unable to reimburse.  These numbers will continue to rise by millions of dollars \nevery week that the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination remain in effect.     \n65.  The consequences of that funding shortfall have been predictably devastating.  \nAs a result of that shortfall, on February 7, USCCB was forced to give four-weeks’ notice of \nplanned termination to 50 staff members in its Migration & Refugee Services office, more than \nhalf of its refugee-resettlement staff.  Those staff members have accumulated expertise with \nUSCCB’s programs, partners, and the refugees USCCB serves; losing them will negatively af-\nfect USCCB’s ability to provide refugee resettlement services in the future. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 23 of 41\n66.  Likewise, USCCB cannot sustain the current scale of its refugee resettlement \nservices without federal funding.  The fact that federal funding is integral to USCCB’s resettle-\nment services is a direct result of congressional decisions about the design of the program and \nthe appropriations directed to it.  And the termination of USCCB’s partnership with the govern-\nment, the first termination in USCCB’s decades-long relationship with the State Department, \nwill cause long-term, potentially catastrophic consequences to USCCB’s programs.  Even if the \nState Department later decides to reinstate the program, the substantial financial risk of partner-\ning with the government to provide these services is too high if reimbursements can be arbitrar-\nily and unlawfully suspended or terminated; USCCB’s local partners will be unwilling to work \nwith USCCB on such programs.  As a result, USCCB faces irreparable harm to its mission to \ncare for vulnerable refugee populations in the United States.  \n67.  USCCB also faces reputational harm as an employer and as a provider of refugee \nresettlement services.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination have caused irrepa-\nrable harm to USCCB’s reputation and relationships with its subrecipients, who have stopped \nreceiving payments from USCCB despite expecting their ordinary-course reimbursements.  \nUSCCB’s inability to meet its subrecipients’ expectations will harm those relationships and \nmake it less likely that subrecipients will be willing to rely on and partner with USCCB in ful-\nfilling refugee-assistance cooperative agreements—or other programs—in the future.  The rep-\nutational harm and staff reductions suffered by USCCB’s subrecipients will also make it more \ndifficult to partner with those organizations going forward. \n68.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination also have caused irreparable \nharm to the refugees in USCCB’s care, who rely on the resettlement program’s material assis-\ntance, language education, and job training in their first 90 days in this country.  Several of \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 24 of 41\nUSCCB’s subrecipients have been forced to stop providing resettlement services for the refu-\ngees in their care.  With each day that passes while the suspension and termination are in effect, \nmore refugees are at risk of losing their new homes and losing access to the vital cash assistance, \nEnglish-language programs, and employment assistance they need to successfully integrate into \ntheir newfound communities.  \n69.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination also harm the public interest.  \nUSCCB and its subgrantees provide essential services to vulnerable, new members of American \nsociety who have entered this country legally after being thoroughly vetted by multiple federal \nagencies.  The services provided by USCCB and its subrecipients successfully integrate refugees \ninto communities and enable refugees to be self-sufficient, consistent with congressional direc-\ntives.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)–(b).  And the results bear out Congress’s judgment.  When \nso integrated, refugees have a significant, positive impact on society and the U.S. economy:  \nFrom 2005 to 2019, for example, refugees served by the Department of Health and Human \nService’s Office of Refugee Resettlement yielded a net positive fiscal impact of $123.8 billion \nand generated $581 billion in revenue for state and federal governments.  See Off. of Assistant \nSec’y for Plan. & Evaluation, U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., The Fiscal Impact of Refu-\ngees and Asylees at the Federal, State, and Local Levels from 2005 to 2019, at 4 (Feb. 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y95E-QLWS.  And Congress’s passage of the Migration and Refugee Assis-\ntance Act of 1962, the Refugee Act of 1980, and the decades-worth of consistent and meaningful \nappropriations for refugee resettlement express the wise judgment of multiple Congresses and \nPresidents that providing refugee resettlement services is in the public interest. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 25 of 41\nCOUNT I \nAdministrative Procedure Act and Equitable Cause of Action \n(Violations of Appropriations Statutes) \n70.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n71.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside agency action that \nis “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” “in excess of statutory juris-\ndiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or “without observance of proce-\ndure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)–(D). \n72.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination undermine the Constitution’s \nseparation of powers, contravene statutes requiring the government to provide certain forms of \nrefugee assistance to the extent of available appropriations, and violate the Impoundment Con-\ntrol Act’s substantive and procedural requirements.    \n73.  The Constitution vests the power of the purse in Congress.  The Appropriations \nClause and Article I ensure “that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult \njudgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to the individual \nfavor of Government agents.”  Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427–28 (1990) \n(emphasis added).  “If it were otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded power over \nthe public purse of the nation; and might apply all its moneyed resources at his pleasure.”  Id. at \n427 (quoting Joseph Story, 2 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1348 \n(3d ed. 1858)).   \n74.  Those principles apply with equal force when the Executive Branch refuses to \nspend money that Congress has appropriated for specific purposes.  In those circumstances, the \n“practical effect” of Executive impoundments is to unilaterally negate appropriations statutes, \ncontravening the “‘finely wrought’ procedure that the Framers designed” for the enactment or \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 26 of 41\nrepeal of a law.  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438–40 (1998).  That is why “where \npreviously appropriated money is available for an agency to perform a statutorily mandated \nactivity,” there is “no basis for a court to excuse the agency from that statutory mandate.”  In re \nAiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n75.  When the Executive Branch ignores Congress’s instructions with respect to ap-\npropriations, it arrogates to itself Congress’s power of the purse.  That threatens to concentrate \n“power in the hands of a single branch” at grave risk to individual liberty, which is “always at \nstake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers.”  Clinton, \n524 U.S. at 450 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The Executive’s power therefore is at its “lowest \nebb” when it defies Congress’s appropriations laws.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n76.  Here, Congress has imposed (with the President’s assent) two independent re-\nstrictions on the Executive Branch’s ability to suspend or terminate funding for refugee reset-\ntlement:  First, it has enacted a statute mandating that the State Department spend available \nappropriations on certain forms of assistance for refugees it has admitted; and, second, it has \nenacted the Impoundment Control Act, which permits the Executive Branch to defer spending \nappropriated funds only for particular reasons and after complying with specific procedures.  \nThe government has defied both of those congressional commands.   \n77.  First, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination contravene Congress’s \ncommand that in administering the initial-resettlement program, the government must promptly \nprovide certain services to admitted refugees.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended \nby the Refugee Act of 1980, provides that once the government chooses to admit refugees into \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 27 of 41\nthe United States, the Secretary must provide funding to those refugees “to the extent of availa-\nble appropriations.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  Among other things, the Sec-\nretary “shall” make available “as quickly as possible” “sufficient resources for employment \ntraining” and for “sufficient English language training.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n78.  Here, the government has chosen to admit refugees into the United States.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A).  At the time of the Refugee Funding Suspension, it had assigned \nnearly 7,000 refugees to USCCB who had been in the United States for 90 days or less.  The \ngovernment therefore has an obligation to make available funding for resettling those refugees \n“as quickly as possible” and “to the extent of available appropriations.”  Id.   \n79.  The government has made no suggestion that the funds Congress appropriated to \nsupport this program have been exhausted.  Last year alone, Congress appropriated $3.9 billion \nto the State Department for, among other things, “migration and refugee assistance.”  Depart-\nment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024, 138 Stat. \nat 744; see also Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, 135 Stat. at \n375 (appropriating an additional $976,100,000 for special immigrant visa holders from Afghan-\nistan, among other things).  Nor has it suggested that it is providing the statutorily mandated \ninitial-resettlement services to the refugees in USCCB’s care through other means.  Yet the \ngovernment, through the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, is indefinitely refusing \nto spend that money, even though Congress has commanded that it do so for statutorily man-\ndated purposes—including providing employment and English training to refugees already \nplaced with USCCB.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(A).  The government instead has left USCCB \nand its assigned refugees to fend for themselves.  The Refugee Act of 1980 simply does not give \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 28 of 41\nthe government “discretionary control over the outlay of funds” that Congress not only has ap-\npropriated for these specific purposes but also mandated that the government spend for those \nsame purposes.  Train, 420 U.S. at 45. \n80.  Second, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are independently un-\nlawful because they violate the Impoundment Control Act.  That Act limits the authority of the \nExecutive Branch “to defer any budget authority provided for a specific purpose or project.”  2 \nU.S.C. § 684(a).  It defines a “deferral of budget authority” broadly to include “withholding or \ndelaying the obligation or expenditure of budget authority . . . provided for projects or activi-\nties,” or “any other type of Executive action or inaction which effectively precludes the obliga-\ntion or expenditure of budget authority.”  Id. § 682(1) (emphasis added); see Matter of Henry \nM. Jackson, U.S. Senate, B-200685, 1980 WL 14499, at *1 (Comp. Gen. Dec. 23, 1980) (“[A]ny \nexecutive branch action or inaction whether based on programmatic, budgetary, or other factors, \nis potentially subject to the Impoundment Control Act if it precludes or delays, the use of budget \nauthority.”).  \n81.  The Impoundment Control Act establishes procedural requirements for deferring \nor rescinding budget activities required by Congress.  If an agency intends to temporarily or \npermanently defer spending money that it has been appropriated, “the President shall transmit” \na special message to Congress specifying, among other things, how much budget authority he \nwishes to defer and for how long, the specific projects or governmental functions involved, his \nreasons and legal authority for doing so, and the “fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the \nproposed deferral.”  2 U.S.C. § 684(a).  Similarly, if the President wishes to “rescind[]” budg-\n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 29 of 41\netary authority—“terminat[ing] . . . authorized projects or activities for which budgetary author-\nity has been provided”—he must submit a special message to Congress explaining and justifying \nhis proposal.  Id. § 683(a).   \n82.  The Impoundment Control Act also imposes substantive limits on the Executive \nBranch’s authority to defer or rescind budget authority.  “Deferrals shall be permissible only” \nto “(1) provide for contingencies; (2) to achieve savings made possible by or through changes \nin requirements or greater efficiency of operations; or (3) as specifically provided by law.”  Id. \n§ 684(b) (emphasis added).  “No officer or employee of the United States may defer any budget \nauthority for any other purpose”—including based on policy disagreements.  Id.  As the D.C. \nCircuit has explained, a “President sometimes has policy reasons (as distinct from constitutional \nreasons) . . . for wanting to spend less than the full amount appropriated by Congress for a par-\nticular project or program.”  In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 261 n.1.  “But in those circum-\nstances, even the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.”  Id.  \n“Instead, the President must propose the rescission of funds” under the Impoundment Control \nAct, “and Congress then may decide whether to approve a rescission bill.”  Id.  If Congress does \nnot enact a rescission bill, the funds must be “made available.”  2 U.S.C. § 683(b). \n83.  Here, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination effect a “deferral of \nbudget authority” within the meaning of the Impoundment Control Act.  The suspension indef-\ninitely halts—and the termination defers or rescinds—the disbursement of millions in funds that \nCongress appropriated to the government for refugee assistance and the government committed \nto expending through cooperative agreements with USCCB.  Despite Congress’s specific ap-\npropriation of funds for refugee assistance, the government seeks categorically not to spend \nthose funds.  That is unquestionably a “delay[]” in the “expenditure of budget authority” or an \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 30 of 41\n“action” that “effectively precludes the . . . expenditure of budget authority” under the Impound-\nment Control Act.  2 U.S.C. § 682(1); see also New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 357368, at *2 \n(D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025) (Executive Branch’s indefinite pause of all federal financial assistance \nlikely violates the Impoundment Control Act).  It also constitutes the “termination of authorized \nprojects or activities for which budget authority has been provided.”  2 U.S.C. § 683(a).  \n84.  The Refugee Funding Suspension’s and Termination’s deferral and rescission of \nbudget authority violates the Impoundment Control Act’s procedural requirements by ignoring \nthem altogether.  There is no indication that the President has transmitted to Congress any spe-\ncial message explaining and justifying the deferral or rescission of budgetary authority effected \nby the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, as the Act requires.  See 2 U.S.C. \n§§ 683(a), 684(a).  The Act’s procedural requirements would have forced the government to \nconsider and explain the consequences of its sudden funding suspension or termination before \nacting.  The government’s failure to do so violates the Act.   \n85.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination also run afoul of the substan-\ntive limitations imposed by the Act.  USCCB’s suspension letter states that the government is \ndeferring spending because the awards “may no longer effectuate agency priorities.”  Ex. A, \nSuspension Letter, supra.  USCCB’s termination letters purport to make a definitive conclusion \nto that effect.  Ex. D, Ex. E, Termination Letters, supra.  To the extent that rationale has any \ndiscernable meaning at all, it expresses nothing more than a pure policy disagreement.  As the \nD.C. Circuit has recognized, such policy disagreements fall outside the Act’s three enumerated \ncategories of permissible deferrals.  2 U.S.C. § 684(b)(1)–(3); In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 31 of 41\n261 n.1 (“[I]n those circumstances, even the President does not have unilateral authority to re-\nfuse to spend the funds”).  And because Congress has not enacted a rescission bill, the Impound-\nment Control Act forbids the termination.  2 U.S.C. § 683(b).  \n86.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination thus violate both the Refugee \nAct of 1980 and its related appropriations statutes, and the Impoundment Control Act—all in \ncontravention of the Constitution’s separation of powers.  To the extent that the government \nmight argue that the Foreign Aid Executive Order or the Rubio Memo independently justify or \nrequire the Refugee Funding Suspension or Termination, those actions are unlawful for the same \nreasons. \n87.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, including the suspension of \nreimbursements for pre-January 24 expenses and for ongoing expenses that USCCB incurs in \nimplementing the refugee-resettlement program under Section 1522, should be declared unlaw-\nful and set aside, as should the Rubio Memo to the extent it applies to USCCB.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 706.  Defendants and all persons acting in concert with them should be enjoined from \nenforcing, implementing, or in any manner giving effect to the Refugee Funding Suspension \nand Termination—and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Foreign Aid Executive Order \nand Rubio Memo.  See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, \n327 (2015) (recognizing equitable cause of action to enjoin “violations of federal law by federal \nofficials”); Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902).  \nCOUNT II \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n88.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 32 of 41\n89.  The Administrative Procedure Act authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set \naside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n90.  The APA requires agency action to be “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  \nOhio v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024) (quotation marks omitted).  Agency action \nis arbitrary and capricious “if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended \nit to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an expla-\nnation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible \nthat it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).   \n91.  Among the most important factors that an agency must consider are “serious re-\nliance interests” engendered by its prior policies and significant alternatives to its chosen course \nof action.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (reliance \ninterests); Allied Local & Reg’l Mfrs. Caucus v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 215 F.3d 61, 80 (D.C. Cir. \n2000) (alternatives).   \n92.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are textbook arbitrary-and-\ncapricious agency actions.  The government utterly failed to consider the dire consequences of \nits actions and obvious, superior alternatives; it gave no reasoned explanation for its decisions; \nand it ignored its own regulations.   \n93.  First, the government “entirely failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of the \nproblem.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Most glaringly, the government did not account for the \nobvious and serious consequences that an immediate funding suspension or termination would \nhave on award recipients like USCCB, its subrecipients, and individual refugees—including \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 33 of 41\nirreparable damage to USCCB’s reputation, relationships, and mission, and to refugees who lose \nessential services and training during the critical first months of their resettlement periods.  The \ngovernment made no effort whatsoever to identify (let alone weigh) the costs and benefits of its \nblunderbuss Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination—and tellingly could provide no ex-\nplanation even after USCCB raised these issues with PRM post suspension.   \n94.  In so failing, the government also ignored the substantial, reasonable reliance \ninterests imperiled by a sudden suspension or termination of refugee-assistance awards.  Re-\ngents, 591 U.S. at 30 (“When an agency changes course . . . it must be cognizant that longstand-\ning policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” \n(quotation marks omitted)); see also Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009).   \n95.  For decades, USCCB has reasonably relied on awards from the government un-\nder the terms of its cooperative agreements.  USCCB has entered into cooperative agreements \nwith and received reimbursement from the government every year since 1980, and never—not \nuntil the Refugee Funding Suspension—has the government halted funding mid-agreement.  \nUSCCB fulfills its obligations under the agreements to provide high-quality, essential resettle-\nment assistance to thousands of refugees; and it reasonably expects in return, based on past \nexperience and the terms of the agreements, that the government will meet its statutory funding \nobligations.     \n96.  By abruptly cutting off funding without notice, the government predictably evis-\ncerated USCCB’s serious reliance interests.  USCCB has about $13 million (and growing) of \nunreimbursed costs that it incurred prior to the Refugee Funding Suspension in reliance on its \ncooperative agreements and owes an additional $11.4 million to its subrecipients for services \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 34 of 41\nrendered, $9.8 million of which is for services rendered prior to the Suspension.  Because of the \nRefugee Funding Suspension, USCCB on February 7 had no choice but to notify 50 employ-\nees—more than half of its refugee resettlement staff—of impending termination.  All of those \nemployees relied on continued funding under USCCB’s cooperative agreements.  Moreover, \nUSCCB already has had to stop reimbursing its subrecipients providing direct services to refu-\ngees, causing those organizations to go unpaid despite their reliance on the State Department’s \ncompliance with its funding obligations.  And most disheartening, lawfully admitted refugees \nwho resettled in this country relying on the Department’s promise to aid their integration have \nlost—and more will soon lose—the essential services provided to them by USCCB and its sub-\nrecipients.  The Termination has cemented that these harms are going to continue. \n97.  The APA “required” the government—before taking action—“to assess whether \nthere were reliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such in-\nterests against competing policy concerns.”  Regents, 591 U.S. at 33.  \n98.  The government also failed to consider several obvious, less disruptive “alterna-\ntive way[s] of achieving [its] objectives.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 48.  First, before issuing the \nSuspension, the State Department could have conducted a review of its outstanding cooperative \nagreements to ensure their compliance with agency priorities before halting funds to active \nawardees.  The government has “not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of \nall congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance \ninterests for thousands of businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a \nrational precursor to reviewing the programs.”  AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. Dep’t of State, \n2025 WL 485324, at *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025).  Indeed, there is no indication that the govern-\nment considered this alternative, and it certainly did not explain itself.  That glaring failure also \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 35 of 41\ndooms the Refugee Funding Suspension.  Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. v. Fed. Commc’ns \nComm’n, 794 F.2d 737, 746 n.36 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“The failure of an agency to consider obvious \nalternatives has led uniformly to reversal.”).   \n99.  The government also failed to consider an obvious, less disruptive alternative to \nthe Refugee Funding Termination—namely, terminating USCCB’s awards prospectively only \nwhile allowing USCCB to provide services to the refugees already in its care until the end of \ntheir initial 90-day periods and to conduct an orderly wind down of their resettlement programs.  \nAs with the suspension, the government has “not offered any explanation” for why the termina-\ntions needed to occur immediately.  AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 2025 WL 485324, at *5.  The \ngovernment’s failure to consider the devastation the abrupt terminations would cause was arbi-\ntrary and capricious.  See Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc., 794 F.2d at 746 n.36.  \n100.  Second, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are arbitrary and ca-\npricious because the reasons the government did provide are manifestly inadequate.   \n101.  The government’s first rationale for the Refugee Funding Suspension was that it \nis “[c]onsistent with” the President’s Foreign Aid Executive Order.  Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \nsupra.  But that Executive Order applies only to “foreign assistance.”  “Foreign assistance,” \nwhatever its meaning, cannot plausibly include awards to an American non-profit for refugees \nin the United States.  Cf. 22 U.S.C. § 2394(b) (“foreign assistance” means aid provided “to a \nforeign country or international organization”).  That is particularly so because the statute under \nwhich the government provides funding to USCCB refers to awards for refugee resettlement as \n“domestic assistance.”  8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(3) (emphasis added).  At a minimum, the government \nmade no effort to explain how USCCB’s activities constitute “foreign assistance” or how the \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 36 of 41\nRefugee Funding Suspension otherwise would be “consistent with” the Foreign Aid Executive \nOrder. \n102.  The government’s second rationale for the Refugee Funding Suspension fares no \nbetter.  The government stated that USCCB’s cooperative agreements “may no longer effectuate \nagency priorities,” but it did not explain what those priorities are.  Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \nsupra.  More problematic, the government did not explain why its agreements with USCCB may \nno longer effectuate those priorities—a particularly glaring omission given that the government \nhas continuously funded USCCB’s refugee programs for decades.  It is a basic precept of ad-\nministrative law that “conclusory statements” like these “do not meet the requirement that ‘the \nagency adequately explain its result.’”  Dickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1407 (D.C. Cir. \n1995).   \n103.  The Refugee Funding Termination only contained a single rationale.  The State \nDepartment announced its conclusion that USCCB’s cooperative agreements “no longer effec-\ntuate[] agency priorities” but provided zero explanation as to what priorities the State Depart-\nment considered or how its longstanding relationship with USCCB violated those objectives.  \nEx. D, Ex. E, Termination Letters, supra.  Nothing in the termination letters adequately explains \nhow the State Department reached its decision to terminate its partnership with USCCB.  \n104.  To the extent that the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination include an \nunwritten refusal to reimburse pre-January 24 expenses incurred pursuant to USCCB’s cooper-\native agreements, the government gave no rationale for this action.  It simply stopped reimburs-\ning these expenses even though the written suspension letter and termination letters that USCCB \nreceived explicitly contemplate their reimbursement. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 37 of 41\n105.  Third, in issuing the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, the govern-\nment also ignored its own regulations.  “[A]n agency action may [also] be set aside as arbitrary \nand capricious if the agency fails to comply with its own regulations.”  Nat’l Env’t Dev. Ass’n’s \nClean Air Project v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 752 F.3d 999, 1009 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation and quo-\ntation marks omitted).   \n106.  The State Department has a regulation providing that “[p]ayments for allowable \ncosts [incurred under a Federal award] must not be withheld . . . unless required by Federal \nstatute, regulations, or” if the “recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) (incor-\nporated  by  reference  into  the  State  Department’s  federal  award  regulations  at  2  C.F.R. \n§ 600.101).  Another regulation states that reimbursements for services rendered under a federal \naward must be paid “within 30 calendar days after receipt of the payment request” unless the \nState Department “reasonably believes the request to be improper.”  Id. § 200.305(b)(3).   \n107.  Here, no statute or regulation requires the payments to USCCB to be withheld, \nand the government has not asserted that USCCB has failed to comply with the terms of the \naward or is delinquent in a debt.  And even if the suspension letter theoretically allows reim-\nbursements for “legitimate expenses” incurred prior to January 24, Ex. A, Suspension Letter, \nsupra, the Department’s Refugee Funding Suspension in fact includes an unwritten policy of \nrefusing to reimburse even those “allowable costs,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6).  And more than \nthirty days have passed without reimbursement with respect to at least two of the requests \nUSCCB submitted to the State Department, with more requests that will become past due in the \ncoming days.   \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 38 of 41\n108.  The government also violated its own regulations with respect to the Refugee \nFunding Termination.  The State Department’s regulations permit it to terminate a cooperative \nagreement if it concludes that the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency \npriorities,” but the Department may only effectuate such terminations “pursuant to the terms and \nconditions” of the award and “to the extent authorized by law.”  Id. § 200.340(a)(4).   \n109.  The Refugee Funding Termination violates that regulation.  Even if the State \nDepartment made a reasoned decision that USCCB’s cooperative agreements “no longer effec-\ntuate[]” its priorities, Ex. D, Ex. E, Termination Letters, supra, the terminations still violate the \nagency’s regulations because they are not “authorized by law,” for the reasons already dis-\ncussed, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  Terminating the cooperative agreements for initial-resettle-\nment services without establishing an alternative means to fulfill the State Department’s obli-\ngations under the Refugee Act of 1980 violates that statute—not to mention the Impoundment \nControl Act and the APA.   \n110.  The government’s departure from its own regulations, without explanation, in-\ndependently violates the APA.  \n111.  For each of these reasons, the Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are \narbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  To the extent the government might argue that \nthe Rubio Memo or Foreign Aid Executive Order independently justify or require the Refugee \nFunding Suspension, those actions are arbitrary and capricious for the same reasons. \n112.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, including the suspension of \nreimbursements for pre-January 24 expenses and for ongoing expenses that USCCB incurs in \nimplementing the refugee-resettlement program under Section 1522, should be declared unlaw-\nful and set aside, as should the Rubio Memo to the extent it applies to USCCB.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 706.  Defendants and all persons acting in concert with them should be enjoined from \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 39 of 41\nenforcing, implementing, or in any manner giving effect to the Refugee Funding Suspension \nand Termination—and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Foreign Aid Executive Order \nand Rubio Memo.  See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327. \nCOUNT III \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(Failure To Conduct Notice-And-Comment Rulemaking) \n113.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n114.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are also substantive rules is-\nsued without the notice-and-comment procedures required by the APA.  Before issuing a “sub-\nstantive rule,” the Administrative Procedure Act commands agencies to publish a “[g]eneral \nnotice of proposed rule making” and “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in \nthe rule making.”  5 U.S.C. § 553.  An agency’s failure to do so requires setting aside the \nagency’s resulting action.   See Kooritzky v. Reich, 17 F.3d 1509, 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  \n115.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination are substantive rules because \nthey “alter the rights or interests of parties.”  Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, \n250 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Far from merely putting the public “on notice of pre-existing legal obli-\ngations or rights” or adjudicating an individual’s rights “case-by-case” under pre-existing law, \nthe Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination have the legal effect of prospectively altering \nthe rights of refugees and resettlement organizations like USCCB to receive funding.  Nat. Res. \nDef. Council v. Wheeler, 955 F.3d 68, 83, 85 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  The government therefore was \nrequired to provide public notice and opportunity for comment before implementing this signif-\nicant, prospective change. \n116.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination thus violated the procedural \nrequirements of the APA.  To the extent the government might argue that the Rubio Memo or \nForeign Aid Executive Order independently justify or require the Refugee Funding Suspension \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 29     Filed 03/03/25     Page 40 of 41\nor Termination, the Rubio Memo and agency actions implementing the Foreign Aid Executive \nOrder are unlawful for the same reasons and should be set aside. \n117.  The Refugee Funding Suspension and Termination, including the suspension of \nreimbursements for pre-January 24 expenses and for ongoing expenses that USCCB incurs in \nimplementing the refugee-resettlement program under Section 1522, should be declared unlaw-\nful and set aside, as should the Rubio Memo to the extent it applies to USCCB.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 706.  Defendants and all persons acting in concert with them should be enjoined from \nenforcing, implementing, or in any manner giving effect to the Refugee Funding Suspension \nand Termination—and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Rubio Memo and Foreign Aid \nExecutive Order.  See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court: \n1.  Declare that the Refugee Funding Suspension and Refugee Funding Termination \n(and, to the extent they apply to USCCB, the Rubio Memo and actions implement-\ning the Foreign Aid Executive Order) violate the Refugee Act of 1980, the Im-\npoundment Control Act, and the separation of powers; are arbitrary and capricious \nunder the APA; and are substantive rules that did not comply with the procedural \nrequirements of the APA; \n2.  Hold unlawful and set aside the Refugee Funding Suspension and Refugee Fund-\ning Termination (and, to the extent it applies to USCCB, the Rubio Memo);  \n3.  Enjoin—temporarily, preliminarily, and permanently—Defendants from taking \nany action enforcing or implementing against USCCB the Refugee Funding Sus-\npension, Refugee Funding Termination, Rubio Memo, or Foreign Aid Executive \nOrder;  \n4.

ECF No. 5.  A party seeking a temporary restraining order must \nmake a “clear showing that four factors, taken together, warrant relief: likely success on the \nmerits, likely irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its \nfavor, and accord with the public interest.”  League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  Such an order is an extraordinary remedy, never granted as of \nright.   \nThe Court has considered each of these four factors in light of the parties’ briefs and the \narguments presented at a hearing on February 20, 2025.  The Court finds that Plaintiff has not \nmade the requisite showing and will thus deny Plaintiff’s motion to the extent that it requests a \ntemporary restraining order.  But the Court will set an expedited schedule for additional briefing \non Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00465-TNM     Document 15     Filed 02/20/25     Page 2 of 2\nFor these reasons, it is hereby \nORDERED that Plaintiff’s [5] Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction is DENIED as to the request for a temporary restraining order only. \nSO ORDERED. \n   \n           \nDated: February 20, 2025        TREVOR N.
