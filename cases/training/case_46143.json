Any opposition to the motion to seal shall be filed no later than May 2, 2025, and shall address both these questions. Any letter in further support of sealing shall be filed no later than May 7, 2025. The document at Dkt.

Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits for their claims that Defendants acted  arbitrarily and  capriciously by purporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement in the February 19 Letter except for the  portion of Plaintiffs' argument resting upon Defendants' failure to perform a subsequent NEPA review. Plaintiffs have  adequately shown th at they would be irreparably injured absent an injunction, and that the balance of the equities  and the public interest support an injunction. Because each factor weighs in favor of a preliminary injunction,  Plaintiffs' motions for a prelimina ry injunction are GRANTED. Consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court issues the following injunction: Defendants Sean Duffy, in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation,   Gloria M. Shepherd, in her official capacity as Executive Director of the Federal Highway Administration, the United  States Department of Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration as well as all persons identified under  Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 65(d)(2), including all of Defendants' respective officers, agents, servants,  employees, and attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concert or participation with any of the foregoing,  are enjoined from taking any a gency action founded on the February 19, 2025 letter from Secretary Duffy to Governor  Hochul purporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement and rescind federal approval for New York's Central Business  District Tolling Program, including any action  to enforce compliance with or implement (1) the February 19 Letter,  (2) Defendants' purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, or (3) Defendants' purported termination of the Tolling  Program. For the avoidance of doubt, Defendants are  enjoined from taking any of the \"compliance measures\" set forth  in the April 21, 2025 Letter including withholding federal funds, approvals, or authorizations from New York state or  local agencies to enforce compliance with or implement ( 1) the February 19 Letter, (2) Defendants' purported  termination of the VPPP Agreement, or (3) Defendants' purported termination of the Tolling Program. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt. Nos. 82 and 88. SO ORDERED.      (Signed by Judge Lewis J. Liman on 5/28/2025)   (ar)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration's February 2025 attempt to rescind federal funding for the New York State's congestion pricing program in New York City. The federal government had previously agreed that New York State could assess tolls on vehicles entering federal highways around the city. New York State had already fully implemented the program beginning on January 5, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>On February 19, 2025, plaintiffs, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded presidential authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge Lewis Jeffrey Liman and Magistrate Judge Barbara C. Moses.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 2025, the Riders Alliance and the Sierra Club filed a motion to intervene as plaintiffs. On March 19, 2025, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) filed a motion to intervene as plaintiff&nbsp; These motions were granted and all three intervenors then filed intervenor complaints on March 27, 2025. On April 2, 2025, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) filed a motion to intervene as plaintiff. This motion was granted on April 9. On April 18, 2025, plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, incorporating the intervenor complaints of NYSDOT, the Riders Alliance, the Sierra Club, and NYCDOT.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, 2025, the federal government accidentally filed a letter that a Department of Justice attorney sent to a DOT attorney, expressing skepticism about the validity of the legal theory they were pursuing in the case. The letter was quickly replaced, but is available on the Clearinghouse. The next day, after an exchange of letters, the court granted the defendants' motion to seal the docket item filed in error. The court asked two questions: whether the wide dissemination of the letter via media outlets meant that sealing the docket was without sufficient basis, and whether the publication of the letter waived privilege. On May 14, 2025, after briefing by the parties, the court elected to unseal the letter but prohibit plaintiffs from using its contents in the case.</p>\r\n<p>On May 27, 2025, the court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) prohibiting defendants from acting on the purported termination of the federal government&rsquo;s agreement with New York State and forbidding attempts by defendants to force New York&rsquo;s compliance with the termination. Just one day later, on May 28, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction to the same effect, finding that the benefits offered by congestion pricing outweighed the harm claimed by defendants in being temporarily unable to implement their preferred policy.</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, 2025, defendants filed a motion for summary judgement as to all claims. Plaintiffs and intervenor-plaintiffs also filed separate motions for partial summary judgment, together asking for summary judgment in regards to their APA claims (apart from pretext) and their ultra vires claim and asking for permanent injunctive relief and/or a declaratory judgment holding the program termination unlawful. These cross-motions remain pending as of September 30, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenges the Trump Administration’s attempt in February 2025 to cut federal funding for New York City’s congestion pricing program. The federal government had previously approved New York State’s plan to charge tolls on cars entering certain highways. The program started on January 5, 2025.\r\n\r\nOn February 19, 2025, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) sued the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in federal court in New York. They said the federal government went beyond the president’s power and broke several laws. They asked the court to block the government, declare the program termination illegal, and pay their lawyer fees. The case was assigned to Judge Lewis Liman and Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.\r\n\r\nOther groups joined the lawsuit. On March 4, 2025, the Riders Alliance and Sierra Club asked to join. On March 19, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) joined, and on April 2, New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) joined. Their claims were added in an amended complaint on April 18.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 2025, the federal government accidentally filed a private DOJ letter that questioned its own legal arguments. The letter was replaced, later unsealed, but plaintiffs were not allowed to use it in the case.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, 2025, the court issued a temporary order stopping the government from ending the program. The next day, the court extended that order as a preliminary injunction. The court said the benefits of congestion pricing were more important than the government’s claimed harms.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2025, the government asked for summary judgment on all claims. The plaintiffs and intervenors also asked for partial summary judgment to stop the program permanently and declare the termination illegal. These requests are still waiting for a decision.\r\n\r\nThe case is still ongoing.",

LIMAN, United States District Judge: \n \nProposed Intervenor-Plaintiff New York State Department of Transportation \n(“NYSDOT”) moves for leave to intervene in the above-captioned case, pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 24.  Dkt. Nos. 30–31.  Counsel for the Metropolitan Transit Authority and \ncounsel for the Defendants have stated that they do not oppose NYSDOT’s motion to intervene.  \nDkt. Nos. 31 at 2; Dkt. No. 35.  The Court grants NYSDOT’s motion pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 24(b). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) states in relevant part that “[up]on timely motion, \nthe court may permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the \nmain action a common question of law or fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  The Court has “broad \ndiscretion” to grant or deny the motion.  AT & T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 407 F.3d 560, 561 (2d Cir. \n2005); Bldg. & Realty Inst. of Westchester & Putnam Ctys., Inc. v. State of New York, 2020 WL \n5658703, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2020). \nNYSDOT’s application is timely.  See Green v. Biden, 2024 WL 4932751, at *7 \n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2024) (“Proposed Intervenors timely filed their motion before Defendants even \nfiled their Answer.”).  “The principal guide in deciding whether to grant permissive intervention \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 2 of 3\nis whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the \noriginal parties.”  United States v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., 25 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 1994) (quotation \nomitted); Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3).  No party has identified any potential prejudice to the \nadjudication of their rights and there is no undue delay given the early posture of this case. \n“The words ‘claim or defense’ are not ‘read in a technical sense, but only require some \ninterest on the part of the applicant.’”  United States v. NYCHA, 326 F.R.D. 411, 418 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (quoting Louis Berger Grp., Inc. v. State Bank of India, 802 F.Supp.2d 482, 488 (S.D.N.Y. \n2011)).  NYSDOT’s claims “share the same fundamental question of law with the main suit.”  \n335-7 LLC v. City of New York, 2020 WL 3100085, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2020); see Blatch v. \nFranco, 1998 WL 265132, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 1998) (Chin, J.) (“[I]ntervention is \nappropriate here where the intervenors seek virtually the same relief as the named plaintiffs.”); \ncompare Dkt. No. 1 with Dkt. No. 30-1.  Permissive intervention is further appropriate where, as \nhere, the applicant’s interest will be finally determined by the suit.  See Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Just., 161 F.R.D. 247, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (Sotomayor, J.) (citing Arizona v. \nCalifornia, 460 U.S. 605, 615 (1983)).  NYSDOT is the executive agency tasked “with overall \nresponsibility for balanced transportation policy and planning” on the state’s behalf.  See N.Y. \nTransp. Law § 10.  In that capacity, the NYSDOT “has an interest in securing observance of the \nterms under which it participates in the federal system.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto \nRico, 458 U.S. 592, 607–08 (1982).   \nBecause the Court grants NYSDOT’s motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24(b), the Court need not consider NYSDOT’s argument that intervention is also \nwarranted as a matter of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 3 of 3\nThe Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt.

In recent weeks, New York City has witnessed a minor miracle. Years of intense \nand combined efforts at the local, state, and federal levels have brought to fruition the decades-\nold promise of congestion pricing. The streets are clearer, the air is cleaner, and the millions of \nNew Yorkers who rely on public transit have secured a durable source of funding for this vital \ncivic resource.  \n2.  On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration declared an end to all that. \nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced by letter that the federal government had \npurported to rescind its previous agreement to authorize the Congestion Pricing Program. \nAlthough President Trump had repeatedly announced his opposition to the Program and his \nintention to end it, Secretary Duffy did not acknowledge that the decision was based on political \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 2 of 32\nanimosity to a successful program that was delivering results for New Yorkers. Instead, \nSecretary Duffy explained that he had discovered an unwritten restriction in federal law, a secret \nloophole establishing that the Congestion Pricing Program had never been lawfully authorized to \nbegin with. An hour later, the White House posted a statement from President Trump: \n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG \nLIVE THE KING!” The White House accompanied the statement with an image of President \nTrump, wearing a crown, posed against the Manhattan skyline. \n3.  Fortunately, President Trump is not a king, and the Congestion Pricing Program is \nnot dead. In our system of government neither presidents nor cabinet secretaries may impose \ntheir will on New Yorkers except by following the law. Secretary Duffy’s letter utterly fails this \ntest by resting on a legal theory so insubstantial as to appear pretextual. The Congestion Pricing \nProgram weathered numerous significant challenges before the cameras enabling tolling could \nfinally be turned on. The Trump administration’s feeble decree cannot justify turning them off. \n4.  For years, New York City was choking on cars. In the absence of any congestion \nrelief program, vehicles crawled through Manhattan’s Central Business District (“CBD”) in \nsome of the worst traffic in the world, spewing dangerous fumes, harming the region’s economy \nand quality of life, and exacerbating the climate crisis. In a typical year, more than one thousand \nCity residents would die prematurely from air pollution produced by motor vehicle traffic alone.  \n5.  Even as New York City struggled under the weight of hundreds of thousands of \nexcess vehicles, the main alternative—New York City’s public transit system—suffered the \nconsequences of chronic underinvestment. Many parts of the City’s transit infrastructure are over \none hundred years old, and repairs and capital improvements that would render the system more \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 3 of 32\nreliable and accessible were repeatedly deferred. City buses—stuck in New York City’s clogged \nstreets—crawled at the slowest speed of all major cities in the United States.  \n6.  New Yorkers found a solution. After years of advocacy by broad coalitions of \nNew Yorkers, the Legislature in 2019 enacted the Traffic Mobility Act. The Act rests on the \nLegislature’s determination that the city’s twin problems of traffic congestion and an \nunderfunded public transit system can be addressed together by imposing a toll on vehicle traffic. \nThe Act requires the establishment of a tolling program in the CBD, defined as Manhattan south \nof 60th street, except for FDR Drive and the West Side Highway. Tolling revenues, in turn, \nsupport capital projects to fund public transit and provide an alternative to motor vehicle traffic. \nBecause the tolled area includes federal-aid highways, the federal government took the position \nthat the Program required federal approval before it could begin. In June 2019, the New York \nState and City Departments of Transportation, and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority \n(“TBTA”)— an affiliate of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”)—sought an \nagreement to implement congestion pricing from the Federal Highway Administration \n(“FHWA”) under the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”). \n7.  The FHWA spent years studying the Congestion Pricing Program, ultimately \nauthorizing it by executing a VPPP agreement on November 21, 2024. The FHWA’s review \nincluded a comprehensive 958-page Environmental Assessment of the proposed Congestion \nPricing Program under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), produced after careful \nstudy and consideration of tens of thousands of public submissions. The Environmental \nAssessment concluded the Program would reduce levels of all pollutants in the New York City \nmetropolitan area that are regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 4 of 32\n8.  On January 5, 2025, the Congestion Pricing Program implemented the \nrequirements imposed by the Traffic Mobility Act. It is the product of years of environmental \nplanning, infrastructure procurement, and coordination between local, state, and federal \nauthorities. The Program is essential to New York City’s future. It provides cleaner air, reduces \neconomically ruinous traffic congestion, and funds desperately needed improvements to the \npublic transit system that will allow it to better serve the needs of all New Yorkers, including \nNew Yorkers with disabilities.  \n9.  Within weeks of the program’s successful launch, Secretary Duffy announced his \ndecision to end it. The Secretary claimed to have discerned two novel limitations on the FHWA’s \nVPPP authority that appear nowhere in the text of the operative statute: First, that VPPP \nauthority implicitly excludes tolling an entire congested area (a form of congestion pricing \nknown as  “cordon pricing”); and second, that VPPP toll levels may not be set by accounting for \nthe need to accommodate displaced vehicle traffic through funding alternate transit options. \nAccording to the letter, these unwritten restrictions mean that the FHWA could never have \nlawfully authorized the Congestion Pricing Program. On this basis, Secretary Duffy disclaimed \nany need to consider the effects of ending the Congestion Pricing Program, announced that the \nFHWA had unilaterally withdrawn from the VPPP agreement, and declared that the program \nwould end. \n10.  Rather than identifying a policy judgment underlying his decision to end the \nCongestion Pricing Program, Secretary Duffy purported to rely entirely on a legal judgment. But \nthe legal reasoning in the letter is patently inadequate: it disregards both statutory text and \ndecades of history. The FHWA has long recognized that “cordon pricing” is a form of congestion \npricing available under the VPPP authority; the agency initially funded such a project more than \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 5 of 32\ntwenty years ago, and it has reported to Congress throughout on the use of VPPP authority. \nMeanwhile Congress has repeatedly preserved the FHWA’s VPPP authority without restricting \nthe FHWA’s straightforward and commonsense understanding that cordon pricing is a \npermissible form of congestion pricing. Secretary Duffy’s claim that it was impermissible to \ncalculate tolls by reference to the funding needed to sustain mass transit is equally specious. For \ncongestion pricing to work, there must be a reliable transit alternative for travelers displaced \nfrom the congested streets. Federal caselaw has long recognized that New York City’s roads and \npublic transit system are two sides of the same coin: funding public transit is a necessary \ncondition for reducing congestion on our streets.  \n11.  It is baffling that Secretary Duffy would rest his entire decision on such a flimsy \nlegal theory, except as a pretext. Ordinarily, when an agency considers abandoning its previous \nposition, federal law requires serious consideration of whether other actors have already spent \nenormous amounts of money and time in reliance on the agency’s guidance. Here, such \nconsideration would have to account for the hundreds of millions of dollars that have already \nbeen spent over the long years in which the federal government took the opposite position, and \nany lawful effort to unwind the current Congestion Pricing Program would have to consider less \ncostly and disruptive alternatives. The Trump administration evidently hoped to evade these \nrequirements by claiming that Secretary Duffy is merely correcting a previous legal error. But as \nthe Supreme Court made clear last time a cabinet secretary tried to evade judicial scrutiny by \nconcocting a thin pretext, federal law prohibits agencies from hiding their true reasons behind a \nconvenient fiction. \n12.  Further dooming the Secretary’s decision, there is no indication that the agency \neven attempted to consider the environmental consequences of the radical action it purports to \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 6 of 32\nrequire, even as the federal government’s own studies establish that ending congestion pricing \nwill harm New Yorkers’ air quality. Finally, while Secretary Duffy takes the position that he \nmay unilaterally end the Congestion Pricing Program, nothing in the statute actually provides \nhim this authority, rendering his action ultra vires. \n13.  The Court should vacate the Secretary’s decision and declare unlawful the Trump \nadministration’s attempt to unilaterally deprive New Yorkers of the cleaner air and clearer streets \nthat so many have worked toward for so long. The people of New York City deserve to breathe.  \nPARTIES \n14.  Intervenor-Plaintiff Riders Alliance is New York City’s grassroots nonprofit \nmembership organization of thousands of subway and bus riders who come together to work \ntoward a more reliable, accessible, and affordable public transit system. Riders Alliance \nmembers participate in a wide variety of activities to improve public transit, including \ncommunity meetings, rallies, press conferences, interviews, public testimony, visits with elected \nand appointed officials, and more. Since forming in 2012, the group’s organizers have canvassed \nsubway platforms and bus stops to recruit thousands of members to volunteer on a range of \ncampaigns. In 2018 and 2019, Riders Alliance members were integral to the adoption of the \nCongestion Pricing Program.  \n15.  Intervenor-Plaintiff Sierra Club is a grassroots environmental organization with \nmore than 800,000 members across the country; the Atlantic Chapter is responsible for \nmembership and activities in New York State. Sierra Club works to promote a cleaner, healthier, \nand more sustainable natural environment in its members’ communities. Sierra Club has \napproximately 50,000 members in New York State. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 7 of 32\n16.  Numerous Riders Alliance and Sierra Club members live in and around the areas \nof New York City directly affected by the Congestion Pricing Program. As transit riders, many \nof whom depend on bus service and are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, these members \nhave a significant interest in the outcome of this litigation and the implementation of congestion \npricing. Ending the Congestion Pricing Program would harm them in numerous ways, including \nby: degrading the air quality around their homes, workplaces, and the outdoor areas they \nregularly use and enjoy; reducing their ability to access medical care and business opportunities \ndue to buses afflicted by the slowest speeds in the nation; and reducing their ability to use public \ntransport due to the defunding of the MTA’s previously budgeted accessibility improvements.  \n17.  Riders Alliance members include Bill Cryer. He and his family live less than one \nmile from the Kingsbridge bus depot. He works less than half a mile from the Holland Tunnel. \nHis child attends kindergarten less than one mile from the Trans-Manhattan Expressway, where \nInterstate 95 crosses Manhattan east of the George Washington Bridge. The Congestion Pricing \nProgram reduces traffic near the Holland Tunnel, improving air quality. Additionally, as part of \nthe Congestion Pricing Program, the MTA has prioritized transitioning the fossil fuel-burning \nbus fleet at the Kingsbridge Depot and the Gun Hill Depot to electric buses, in order to improve \nthe air quality near both locations. \n18.  Deborah Baldwin is a Riders Alliance member from Manhattan. She is a senior \ncitizen and is undergoing cancer treatments. She lives and works near the Queens-Midtown \nTunnel portal and is heavily exposed to car and truck exhaust fumes whenever she goes outside. \nMs. Baldwin also rides buses to visit her doctors and to other appointments; Manhattan’s bus \nspeeds are significantly improved by the Congestion Pricing Program. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 8 of 32\n19.   Norma Ginez is a Riders Alliance member from the Bronx. She lives several \nblocks from the Cross Bronx Expressway. She has three children with special needs who also \nattend schools within several blocks of the Cross Bronx Expressway. She and her family depend \non buses to get around and often endure long waits for service in congested areas. They benefit \nfrom the mitigation projects that are funded by the Congestion Pricing Program, as well as from \nthe faster bus service that results from the Program.  \n20.  George Bettman is a Riders Alliance member from Brooklyn. He is a senior \ncitizen and suffers from impaired mobility. He rides the subway to work and to medical \nappointments, but reaching the subway platform in stations without elevators is extremely \ndifficult for him. The Congestion Pricing Program raises funds for the accessibility \nimprovements that he and other riders with disabilities desperately need. \n21.  Barbara Moore is a Riders Alliance member who has lived on Canal Street in \nlower Manhattan since 1978. She is seventy-two years old. She spends most of her time in the \nCBD and enjoys walking and biking outdoors. Because Ms. Moore was diagnosed with Chronic \nObstructive Pulmonary Disease, she must curtail her outdoor activities when the air quality is \npoor. She has also had to invest in two large indoor air purifiers to mitigate the degraded air \nquality around her home.  \n22.  Numerous individual Sierra Club members live in or near the Manhattan CBD, \nregularly engage in outdoor activities in the CBD, and are particularly vulnerable to the threats \nposed by air pollution in the CBD in the absence of the Congestion Pricing Program. \n23.  For example, Michelle M. Tokarczyk is a Sierra Club member who has lived for \ndecades in Chelsea, in the Manhattan CBD. Ms. Tokarczyk enjoys cycling on the Manhattan \nWaterfront Greenway in the CBD and taking long walks outdoors near her home in the \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 9 of 32\nManhattan CBD. But Ms. Tokarczyk is seventy-one years old and has diabetes and \nMicrovascular Cardiac Disease. She has been instructed by her cardiologist to avoid exerting \nherself outdoors when the air quality is impaired. As a result, she has been unable to ride her \nbicycle or take long walks outdoors at times due to the frequent high levels of air pollution in the \nManhattan CBD. The Congestion Pricing Program helps improve the air quality near Ms. \nTokarczyk’s home and increases her ability to use and enjoy the parks and roads near her home. \n24.  Lawrence S. Freund is a Sierra Club member who regularly runs outdoors in the \nManhattan CBD. However, he is eighty-one years old and has already had lung cancer surgery \nthat removed a portion of one lung. He is also susceptible to pulmonary diseases from working \non Wall Street on and after September 11, 2001. Mr. Freund was exposed to the World Trade \nCenter dust cloud and spent significant amounts of time in the disaster area, and his pulmonary \nhealth has been monitored for several years by the World Trade Center Health Program. He faces \nsignificant health risks from poor air quality in the Manhattan CBD. \n25.  Mary Olowin is a Sierra Club member who lives in the Manhattan CBD. She is \nseventy-six years old. Ms. Olowin frequently spends time outdoors in the CBD, walking an \naverage of five miles a day outdoors. Ms. Olowin faces increased risks from the Manhattan \nCBD’s degraded air quality due to her age and the number of outdoor activities she undertakes. \nMs. Olowin moved to the CBD specifically so that she could give up her car and use public \ntransportation. Yet the public transportation Ms. Olowin relies on has been placed in financial \njeopardy due to Secretary Duffy’s threat to the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n26.  Defendant Sean Duffy is the Secretary of the United States Department of \nTransportation (“DOT”). He is sued in his official capacity. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 10 of 32\n27.  Defendant Gloria M. Shepherd is the Executive Director of the FHWA. She is \nsued in her official capacity. \n28.  Defendant DOT is a cabinet department of the federal government, with offices in \nWashington, D.C.  \n29.  Defendant FHWA is an agency under the DOT, with offices in Washington, D.C. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n30.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 24 U.S.C. § 1331 because \nthis case presents a federal question under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551 et seq.  \n31.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause Riders Alliance is headquartered in this district and a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district.  \nBACKGROUND \nNew York City’s air quality, traffic congestion, and public transit system were in desperate \nneed of reform. \n32.  New York City’s traffic congestion has been consistently among the worst in the \nUnited States. The cars, trucks, and buses that clog the roads are a major source of harmful air \npollution in the metropolitan area, and a significant contributor to climate change. Vehicles emit \nair pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (which lead to ozone formation), as well \nas toxics like benzene and volatile organic compounds that are known to cause and exacerbate \nhealth problems including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, asthma, and \ndiabetes. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 11 of 32\n33.  Air pollution from cars, trucks, and buses has been estimated to cause over 1,000 \ndeaths each year in New York City, as well as many emergency department admissions and \nmissed days of school and work.1 \n34.  Traffic emissions are by far the largest contributor to high ozone levels in the \nNew York City metropolitan area.2 For many years, the New York City metropolitan area has \nbeen out of compliance with federal air quality standards for ozone, and ozone levels in New \nYork City were higher in 2022 than any previous year of citywide air monitoring.3 \n35.  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to \nozone “can cause a number of health problems, including coughing, breathing difficulty, and \nlung damage. Exposure to ozone can make the lungs more susceptible to infection, aggravate \nlung diseases, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, and increase the risk of early death from \nheart or lung disease.” 4 People at greater risk from ozone exposure include people with lung \ndisease, older adults, and people who are active outdoors. \n \n1  Susan Anenberg et al., Int’l Council on Clean Transp., A Global Snapshot of the Air Pollution-\nRelated Health Impacts of Transportation Sector Emissions in 2010 and 2015, at 19 tbl.4, 38 \ntbl.A2 (2019), https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global_health_impacts_transport \n_emissions_2010-2015_20190226.pdf; see also Calvin A.

Traffic congestion causes people living in the New York City metropolitan area to \nexperience high levels of risk for cancer and respiratory difficulties caused by air toxics and \ndiesel particulate matter, compared to the rest of the United States.5  \n37.  Concentrations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are \nhighest in parts of the city with high traffic density—in particular, the CBD.6 \n38.  Older adults with lung disease and diabetes are particularly vulnerable to air \npollution. According to the EPA, “Ozone and Particulate Matter (PM) (especially smaller, fine \nparticle pollution called PM 2.5) have the greatest potential to affect the health of older adults. \nFine particle pollution has been linked to premature death, cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks, \nasthma attacks, and the development of chronic bronchitis. Ozone, even at low levels, can \nexacerbate respiratory diseases.”7 \n39.  While traffic congestion pollutes the air and snarls travel on the streets, below \nground New York City subway travelers face the consequences of aging infrastructure that has \nlong suffering from a major backlog of capital investment needs. Aboveground, bus speeds \nslowed by 28 percent in the CBD between 2010 and 2019. The average traffic speed in the CBD \nin 2019 was only seven miles per hour.8  \n \n5 Environmental Assessment for the Central Business District Tolling Program (“EA”) App. 17D \nat 17D-18, https://new.mta.info/document/111056.  \n6 NYC Community Air Survey Report, 2008–2002, https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/ \nIndicatorPublic/data-features/nyccas/. \n7 Older Adults and Air Quality, AirNow, https://www.airnow.gov/air-quality-and-health/older-\nadults/ (last visited Mar. 3, 2025).  \n8 EA Exec.

Millions of people use public transit to reach and travel around New York City \neach day. In 2019, New York City subways served 1.7 billion passengers, and MTA buses \nserved 677.6 million passengers.9  \n41.  Underinvestment renders many parts of the transit system difficult to access, \nparticularly for riders with disabilities. Many parts of New York City’s transit infrastructure are \nover a century old and “essential capital needs remain to ensure a state of good repair and to \nbring MTA’s transit and rail assets into the 21st Century.”10 The MTA’s 2020–2024 capital \nprogram identifies “$52.0 billion in investments in the region’s subways, buses and commuter \nrailroads” that are required to improve and sustain adequate service.11 \n42.  During the spring and summer of 2017, New Yorker subway riders experienced \n“seemingly daily failures of the tracks, signals, switches or power systems, including three \nderailments,” leading to major travel delays. In June 2017, Governor Cuomo declared the MTA \n– specifically, the New York City Transit Authority – to be in a state of emergency.12  \nNew York Enacts Congestion Pricing Legislation. \n43.  In 2019, after years of advocacy and organizing, a broad coalition of New \nYorkers—ranging from grassroots organizations like Riders Alliance to a mix of community \nrepresentatives, business leaders, and government officials convened by the Governor to serve on \nthe Fix NYC Advisory Panel—successfully persuaded the Legislature and Governor to sign \nlegislation requiring the Congestion Pricing Program. \n44.  On April 1, 2019, the Legislature enacted the Traffic Mobility Act.

[for] residents, commuters, taxi and for-hire vehicle traffic, bus transit and \nemergency services” and “a significant contributor to decreased air quality.” N.Y. Veh. & Traf. \nLaw § 1701. Moreover, the Legislature determined that ongoing failures with New York City’s \nsubway infrastructure “continue to have a . . . deleterious impact on the health, safety, and \nlivelihood of commuters, tourists, resident New Yorkers, as well as . . . the economy of the state \nof New York,” such that “a long-term and sustainable solution is necessary in order to ensure \nstable and reliable funding to repair and revitalize this significantly important mass transit asset.” \nId. \n45.  To address the twin issues of overwhelming traffic and underfunded public transit \ninfrastructure, the Act directs the TBTA to establish a tolling program in the CBD. Id. § 1704-A.  \n46.  Because the tolled area includes federal-aid highways, the FHWA decided that the \nCongestion Pricing Program required federal approval before it could begin. The New York \nState and City Departments of Transportation, and the TBTA (collectively the “Project \nSponsors”) sought federal authorization for a tolling program in the Manhattan CBD within \nmonths of the Traffic Mobility Act becoming law. \nThe Federal Government Studies and Approves the Congestion Pricing Program. \n47.  Beginning in 1991, Congress established the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, \nlater renamed the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”). The VPPP allows FHWA to enter \nagreements with state and local authorities to reduce traffic and fund public transportation \nthrough the use of congestion pricing strategies.  \n48.  Months after it had received the initial VPPP application for the Manhattan CBD \nCongestion Pricing Program, the FHWA began a series of requests for further information.  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 15 of 32\n49.  First, in October 2019, the FHWA informed the Project Sponsors that the VPPP \n“appear[ed] to be the best potential fit” for the Congestion Pricing Program among the various \nfederal tolling programs. The FHWA asked for “a thorough traffic and revenue study” that \nwould explore traffic reductions, toll rates, effects on driving and public transit usage, and the \nuse of tolling revenues. The FHWA received the requested study on January 27, 2020. \n50.  Months passed, and in October 2020, the FHWA solicited and received an update \nabout the effects of COVID-19 on transit and traffic.  \n51.  More months passed, and on March 30, 2021, the FHWA announced that an \nEnvironmental Assessment (“EA”) was required to determine whether the Congestion Pricing \nProgram would have a significant impact on the environment.  \n52.  In spring 2021, the FHWA commenced a comprehensive Environmental \nAssessment of the proposed Congestion Pricing Program in accordance with NEPA. It released \nan 868-page draft Environmental Assessment along with appendices for public comment in \nAugust 2022.  \n53.  The FHWA considered nearly 70,000 public submissions on the draft, including \nmore than 14,000 individual submissions, oral testimony at public hearings, letters, e-mails, \nvoicemails, and submissions via an electronic form. The Project Sponsors conducted six public \nhearings.13  \n54.  In response to initial findings and public concern about impacts on some \nenvironmental justice communities, the Project Sponsors also convened an Environmental \nJustice Technical Advisory Group as well as an Environmental Justice Stakeholder Working \nGroup. After engaging with these groups and conducting a supplementary environmental justice \n \n13 EA Ch. 18 at 18-21–22, https://www.mta.info/document/110891.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 16 of 32\nanalysis, the Project Sponsors committed to $155 million in investments in various mitigation \nmeasures to ensure air quality benefits in environmental justice communities. \n55.  TBTA also held at least twenty-five public meetings on the Congestion Pricing \nProgram, the FHWA-conducted Environmental Assessment, and environmental justice \nimplications of the Program throughout the New York City metropolitan region in 2021 and \n2022. It received more than 22,000 individual comments and more than 55,000 form submissions \non the Environmental Assessment. \n56.  In May 2023, the FHWA approved the 958-page Final Environmental \nAssessment, along with thousands of pages of appendices. The FHWA concluded that the \nCongestion Pricing Program would reduce harmful air pollution both within the CBD and \nthroughout the region through reduction in traffic congestion and vehicle miles traveled. In \naddition, the Program would directly fund mitigation measures to improve air quality and health \nin environmental justice communities, and increase investment in public transit that would \nfurther encourage the use of public transit, further reduce congestion and vehicle miles traveled, \nand further improve New Yorkers’ air. \n57.  Governor Hochul hailed the federal environmental approval of the Congestion \nPricing Program in the summer of 2023, noting that the Program would deliver significant air \nquality improvements. That summer, as the city suffered through smoke from wildfires burning \nin Canada, Governor Hochul emphasized that relief was coming: “[F]or many New Yorkers in \nthe city, poor air quality isn’t a rare occurrence. It’s already making people sick in our own city. . \n. . We’re more cognizant of what’s going into our lungs these days, and we’re experiencing the \neffects of the wildfires in Canada. What about the wildfires that are happening on our own streets \nright here coming out of the exhaust pipes from all these vehicles? 700,000 vehicles enter the \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 17 of 32\ncentral business district every single day of the week. That’s almost impossible to comprehend. \nAnd so, buses, like I said, can’t move. They’re trying to do the right thing, people on buses. \nYou’re trying to make sure they’re doing what’s maybe more affordable for them, which is \nimportant. We have to keep those buses moving. These people have to get to their jobs too. It \ndoesn’t help that they have our buses immobilized.”14  \n58.  TBTA convened a Traffic Mobility Board to recommend a tolling structure for \nthe Program including toll rates, credits, discounts, and exemptions. The Traffic Mobility Board \nshared its recommendations with TBTA in December 2023 and held multiple public hearings. \nThe TBTA Board approved toll rates and exemptions in March 2024. In readiness for the \nProgram’s deployment, the infrastructure required to begin collecting the toll—including \nsensors, gantries, and transponders—was fully installed by that month.  \n59.  The FHWA studied the final toll rate and released its Reevaluation of the \nEnvironmental Assessment on June 14, 2024, confirming that no additional environmental \nreview was necessary. \n60.  Before tolling was set to begin on June 30, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a \n“pause” in the implementation of the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n61.

On November 14, 2024, Governor Hochul announced an end to the “pause” on \nthe implementation of the Congestion Pricing Program, and that the Program would adopt an \napproach where the previously studied toll rates would phase in over several years. \n63.  On November 18, 2024, TBTA approved the phased-in approach, and on \nNovember 21, 2024, the FHWA approved a second reevaluation of the tolls, confirming that no \nfurther environmental analysis was required before the Congestion Pricing Program could begin. \n64.  On November 21, 2024, the FHWA also signed the VPPP agreement, authorizing \ntoll collection as a project approved under the VPPP.  \n65.  The agreement does not provide any means by which the FHWA may unilaterally \nterminate the agreement or the Congestion Pricing Program. It does, however, set forth terms \nunder which the TBTA may unilaterally decide to end the program. \nThe Program is Implemented and Begins Delivering Results for New Yorkers. \n66.  On January 5, 2025, the Congestion Pricing Program began to collect tolls. There \nis already significant evidence of the Program’s success: vehicle traffic is down, transit ridership \nis up, and foot traffic has risen over 2024 levels.15 \n \n15 Arun Venugopal, Vehicle Traffic Is Down in Manhattan, But Pedestrian Traffic Is Up, Data \nSays, Gothamist (Feb. 13, 2025), https://gothamist.com/news/vehicle-traffic-is-down-in-\nmanhattan-but-pedestrian-traffic-is-up-data-says.  \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 19 of 32\n67.  Shortly after the program began, a New York Times headline summarized the \nresults: “Less Traffic, Faster Buses: Congestion Pricing’s First Week.”16 While different bus \nroutes have experienced different levels of improvement at this early stage, The City reported \nthat express bus riders have benefitted enormously: “Commutes on Hudson River and East River \ncrossings for several express bus routes linking the boroughs with Manhattan have, on some \nlines, shaved more than 15 minutes off commuting times.”17 By February 24, the New York \nTimes reported that “New York’s congestion pricing plan raised $48.6 million in tolls during its \nfirst month, a strong start for the program that exceeded expectations and kept it on track to raise \nbillions of dollars for the region’s decaying mass transit system.”18  \n68.  In addition to the direct reduction in traffic, funds made available by the Program \nare already promising to improve New York’s air quality by prioritizing transformation of the \nMTA’s bus depots to accommodate electric buses. New charging infrastructure has been \ncommissioned for the Jamaica Bus Depot, with additional charging systems to be deployed at \nGun Hull and Queens Village to support new zero-emissions buses. \nThe Federal Government Purports to End the Program. \n69.

On January 30, Representative Nicole Malliotakis, who had spoken with \nPresident Trump about their shared dislike for the Congestion Pricing Program, stated that “this \nis a priority task that has been given to the Department of Transportation by the president, and he \nis serious about doing something.”19  \n70.  On February 19, 2025, by letter from Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the \nDepartment of Transportation carried out the “priority task” it had been given and announced the \npurported recission of its previous agreement to implement the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n71.  Although the letter recited several policy disagreements that President Trump and \nothers had expressed about the Congestion Pricing Program, and although Secretary Duffy \nwould subsequently describe his action as “[t]erminat[ing] NYC elitist, anti-worker congestion \npricing,”20 Secretary Duffy maintained that his decision to try and rescind federal approval rested \nsolely on legal judgment. According to his letter, his reading of federal law led him to conclude \nthat “FHWA lacked statutory authority to approve the cordon pricing tolling under the CBDTP \npilot project.”21 \n72.  Secretary Duffy cited “two reasons” for his conclusion: First, all roads into the \nCBD are tolled so as to discourage vehicles from entering, “a method of tolling known as \n‘cordon pricing.’” Cordon pricing mechanisms do not include toll-free lanes or approaches, and \naccording to Secretary Duffy, “no statute contemplates cordon pricing in a situation where tolls \n \n19 Benjamin Oreskes et al., Trump Administration Considers Halting Congestion Pricing, N.Y. \nTimes (Jan. 30, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/nyregion/nyc-trump-congestion-\npricing.html.  \n20 Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy), X (Feb. 24, 2025 9:28 AM), https://x.com/SecDuffy/ \nstatus/1894031690256818515.  \n21 Letter from Sean Duffy, Sec’y of Transp., to Kathy Hochul, Governor of N.Y.

Second, Secretary Duffy asserted that “the imposition of tolls under the \n[Congestion Pricing Program] appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the \nMetropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) system as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.” \nAccording to Secretary Duffy, despite the mountains of evidence demonstrating that the \nCongestion Pricing Program was developed as a durable response to New York City’s gridlock, \nthe Program is in fact an impermissible attempt to fund mass transit. In his interpretation of the \nstatute, “[the] VPPP does not authorize tolls that are calculated based on considerations separate \nfrom reducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.” And because Secretary Duffy \nmaintains that any connection between “improving the transit system” and reducing congestion \nis “attenuated,” in his view the VPPP prohibits considering the MTA’s need to accommodate the \ndisplaced vehicle traffic through sufficiently funded mass transit. \n74.  Secretary Duffy’s letter goes on to concede that there are reliance interests \ndetrimentally affected by his abrupt abandonment of years of FHWA policy. But, according to \nSecretary Duffy, basing the decision on purported statutory grounds allows the government to \nsummarily ignore any reasoned consideration of these interests because “any reliance interests \ncannot overcome the conclusion that FHWA’s approval was not authorized by law.” \n75.  Secretary Duffy’s reasoning suffers from significant and obvious flaws that \nsuggest that his purported statutory conclusion is a pretext, chosen specifically to try and avoid \n \n22 Id. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 22 of 32\nthe enormous reliance interests that would otherwise weigh strongly against the abrupt reversal \nof federal policy. \n76.  First, Secretary Duffy maintains that federal law in general, and the VPPP in \nparticular, has never contemplated “cordon pricing” as a permissible congestion pricing strategy, \nexcept where toll-free options are available to drivers.  \n77.  In fact, cordon pricing has for decades been recognized by the FHWA as a form \nof congestion pricing, and it has awarded funds to study cordon pricing projects under the VPPP \nauthority.  \n78.  As early as 2002, the FHWA announced a VPPP project for “cordon pricing” in \nFort Meyers Beach. See Press Release, FHWA 31-02, U.S. Transportation Secretary Mineta \nAnnounces $56.3 Million for States in Highway Discretionary Funds (July 12, 2002), 2002 WL \n1487104. Cordon pricing presented a natural solution to the congested roadways of the Town of \nFort Myers Beach, Florida, because there was no ability to add new roads or widen existing ones. \nThe VPPP project funded a study of a variable toll that would apply at every approach to the \ntown, in an attempt to reduce the number of vehicles on its overloaded streets. In other words, \nthe FHWA approved a VPPP project more than two decades ago that “provides no toll-free \noption for many drivers,” a cordon pricing strategy “where tolls are inescapable”—precisely the \ntype of project that Secretary Duffy now asserts the “FHWA has never before approved.” And \nthe FHWA regularly reported its VPPP projects to Congress. Although the 2002 project was \nultimately cancelled before final implementation due to political opposition to tolls, there is no \nindication that Congress or the FHWA ever considered the contemplated cordon pricing strategy \nto be outside of the VPPP authorization. On the contrary, FHWA continued for years to describe \nthe Florida cordon pricing project in lists of VPPP projects in its quarterly reports.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 23 of 32\n79.  In subsequent years, FHWA has continued to recognize cordon pricing as an \nimportant element of the congestion pricing framework. In 2008, for example, the agency issued \na primer on congestion pricing, identifying “four main types of pricing strategies.” 23 The FHWA \nidentified “cordon pricing” as one of these four main strategies: “Cordon pricing involves \ncharging a fee to enter or drive within a congested area, usually a city center.”24 The FHWA \nobserved that such strategies have been deployed around the world beginning in 1975, and that \nNew York was considering a cordon pricing scheme in 2008.25 \n80.  In the decades since FHWA authorized the study of cordon pricing in Florida \nunder its VPPP authority, Congress has preserved the FHWA’s VPPP authority and ability to \nenter into VPPP agreements without ever disapproving or modifying the agency’s \nstraightforward and commonsense interpretation of that authority as including cordon pricing \nprojects. In 2005, Congress reauthorized the VPPP in Section 1604(a) of the Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Pub. L. No. \n109-59. Although it modified aspects of the program, it made no changes to the operative \ndefinition of eligible congestion pricing programs. When Congress most recently acted to alter \nfederal highway programs through the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act \n(MAP-21), Pub. L. No. 112-141 (2012), it once again preserved the VPPP authority and \nlanguage without alteration. \n81.  Secretary Duffy’s letter fails to consider important aspects of the problem it \nostensibly addresses. The Secretary’s letter does not address the VPPP’s history or identify any \n \n23 FHWA, U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Congestion Pricing, A Primer: Overview 4 (2008), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08039/fhwahop08039.pdf.  \n24 Id. at 6. \n25 Id. at 6, 17. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 24 of 32\nstatutory text disapproving or limiting the definition of congestion pricing so as to exclude \ncordon pricing strategies.  \n82.  Secretary Duffy’s second stated reason for his decision is no more compelling. \nSecretary Duffy maintains that the VPPP does not authorize the Congestion Pricing Program \nbecause the tolls involve consideration of the need to fund the MTA. But decades of precedent \nestablish that New York City has an integrated transit system, so that funding alternative transit \noptions improves service for the cars that remain in the tolled area. And beyond caselaw, basic \ncommon sense dictates that one cannot reduce vehicle congestion on New York City’s bridges, \nroads, and tunnels without providing a functional alternative to transport the displaced travelers. \nFunding the MTA sufficiently to perform that task is the only way in which congestion pricing \ncould work, and both federal law and the FHWA itself have long recognized the permissibility of \nthis type of funding. \n83.  As an initial matter, there is no serious dispute that federal law authorizes the \nspending of revenues from road tolls on non-road projects. See Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23-CV-10365 (LJL), 2024 WL 5199945, at *16–17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (“[I]t is \nCongress’ unmistakably clear intent that a public authority be permitted to collect funds that \nexceed a toll road’s costs and spend those funds on non-toll road projects.”). \n84.  Nor can there be a serious dispute that funding public transportation is an \nimportant tool for reducing traffic congestion in New York City. More than thirty years ago, a \nfederal court explained that drivers who pay bridge tolls derive congestion benefits when the \ntolls are used to fund public transit in and around New York City: “[T]he commuter rail facilities \nthat serve the eastern and northern suburbs of New York City, along with the subways and buses \nin New York City, effectively reduce traffic on the same arteries, river crossings and streets that \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 25 of 32\nare used by commuters from Staten Island who use the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.” Molinari v. \nNew York Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., 838 F. Supp. 718, 726 (E.D.N.Y. 1993).  \n85.  This basic premise has been sustained repeatedly for many years. The direct \nrelationship between funding the MTA and reducing traffic congestion has been recognized \nagain and again by the federal courts. See, e.g., Janes v. Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., 977 \nF. Supp. 2d 320, 341 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff’d, 774 F.3d 1052 (2d Cir. 2014) (“Defendants have \nimpressively demonstrated the value of mass transit in reducing congestion on bridges and \ntunnels throughout New York City.”); Angus Partners LLC v. Walder, 52 F. Supp. 3d 546, 570 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2014) (“[T]he uncontested benefits that MTA’s functionally integrated transit system \nconfers to TBTA toll-payers include reductions in traffic congestion on TBTA bridges and \ntunnels, along with associated reductions in fuel costs, stress, auto emissions, and wait times.”). \n86.  The Congestion Pricing Program specifically rests on the straightforward \nrelationship between funding transit alternatives and reducing traffic congestion. “The premise of \nthe Tolling Program and the evidence that supports it demonstrates that the improvements to the \ntransit system from the toll will provide benefits to motorists who use the roadways.” Chan, \n2024 WL 5199945, at *21.  \n87.  Along with the courts, the FHWA has long recognized this feature of congestion \npricing. As the agency explains in its 2008 primer, “Congestion pricing can generate substantial \nrevenues from tolls,” which, after paying operating costs, can “support alternatives to driving \nalone, such as public transit.”26  \n \n26 FHWA, Congestion Pricing, A Primer, supra note 23, at 7. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 26 of 32\n88.  The contrary theory proposed by Secretary Duffy is absurd. There is no \npossibility of setting a reasonable toll that accomplishes congestion reduction without a \nconcomitant funding of public transit to accommodate the displaced travelers.  \n89.  Secretary Duffy’s second theory fails to consider important aspects of the \nproblem it ostensibly addresses, addressing neither the caselaw describing New York City’s \nintegrated transit system, nor the basic requirement of providing reliable alternate transit.  \nRiders Alliance and Sierra Club Members Will Be Harmed if Defendants are Allowed to End \nthe Program. \n \n90.  Ending implementation of the Congestion Pricing Program means that New \nYorkers will endure approximately 400,000 additional vehicle miles traveled each day.27 This \nwill deprive Riders Alliance and Sierra Club members of benefits to air quality that have only \njust begun.28 Reevaluation 1 of the CBD Tolling Program estimated that congestion pricing \nwould sharply reduce particulate matter levels in the Central Business District by 11 percent and \nfine particulate matter by 10.49 percent.29 \n91.  In addition, it the Congestion Pricing Program is halted, the Project Sponsors will \nno longer be implementing the promised mitigation measures in environmental justice areas that \nwould have decreased air pollution below the baseline levels existing prior to the Program.

Finally, Riders Alliance and Sierra Club members will suffer from the foregone \nMTA safety, usability, and accessibility improvements that the Congestion Pricing Program \nwould have funded. The buses they depend on will slow down, stations will continue to \ndeteriorate, subway platforms will remain inaccessible to members with disabilities, and the \nnecessary signal improvements for increased service will be once again deferred. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act — Impermissible Pretext \n \n93.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n94.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires reasoned agency decisionmaking and \nauthorizes the judiciary to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n95.  “[I]n order to permit meaningful judicial review, an agency must ‘disclose the \nbasis’ of its action.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780 (2019) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 167–169 (1962)). \n96.  “Several points, considered together, reveal a significant mismatch between the \ndecision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.” Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 783.  \n \n30 EA Appendix 17D at 77, https://www.mta.info/document/111056.   \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 28 of 32\n97.  The public record indicates that President Trump instructed his administration to \nimmediately terminate the Congestion Pricing Program based on his political opposition to the \nProgram.  \n98.  Very shortly after the Secretary of Transportation took office, he purported to \nannounce a radical change in the agency’s years-long course of conduct based on obviously \nflawed legal rationales.  \n99.  The Secretary then pointed to the rationale identified—dubious statutory \ntheories—as justifying complete disregard for the reliance interests that otherwise would appear \nto have constrained the agency from abruptly declaring an abrupt about-face on an enormously \nexpensive, consequential, years-long policy. “When an agency changes course, as [FHWA] did \nhere, it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance \ninterests that must be taken into account.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of \nCalifornia, 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (cleaned up). Rather than seriously evaluate the reliance \ninterests and consider alternatives, the purported reliance on a statutory pretext allowed the \nagency to short-circuit this administrative process.  \n100.  Secretary Duffy also appears to believe that the use of a statutory rationale frees \nhim from any environmental review obligations. While the agency had spent years studying the \nenvironmental impact of implementing the Congestion Pricing Program, the agency did not even \nattempt to study the environmental impacts of abruptly and fully turning the program off.  \n101.  Thus, although the Congestion Pricing Program was debated and studied for \nyears, and although the significant reliance and environmental interests implicated in any \ndecision would appear to bar any immediate termination of the Program, Secretary Duffy \nnonetheless announced that he had discovered a convenient rationale that required the Program \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 29 of 32\nbe ended without further review. Secretary Duffy maintained that it was for this reason alone that \nhe had decided to swiftly eliminate the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n102.  “Altogether, the evidence tells a story that does not match the explanation the \nSecretary gave for his decision.” Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 784. The Administrative Procedure \nAct bars such pretextual decision-making: “The reasoned explanation requirement of \nadministrative law, after all, is meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for \nimportant decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public. \nAccepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.” Id. at 785. \n103.  Because Secretary Duffy’s decision purports to rely on a basis that is not the \ngenuine reason for his decision, the decision must be set aside under the APA. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act — Substantively Arbitrary and Capricious \nDue to Erroneous Legal Premise \n \n104.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n105.  When an “[agency] action is based upon a determination of law as to which the \nreviewing authority of the courts does come into play, an order may not stand if the agency has \nmisconceived the law.” S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943). \n106.  So long as an agency maintains that its action is compelled by law, its action is \nsubstantively arbitrary and capricious if it depends on an erroneous legal conclusion.  \n107.  The decision to end the Congestion Pricing Program is based on purported \nrestrictions in federal law that appear nowhere in statutory text and contradict decades of shared \nunderstanding between the agency and Congress. The decision cannot stand because the agency \nhas misconceived the law.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 30 of 32\n108.  Secretary Duffy’s letter states that the VPPP authority must be read to implicitly \nexclude cordon pricing. But as described above, the FHWA has for decades recognized cordon \npricing as a form of congestion pricing eligible under the VPPP, Congress has repeatedly \nreauthorized and left intact the authority, and nothing in the statute draws a distinction between \ncordon pricing and other forms of congestion pricing. \n109.  Secretary Duffy’s letter also states that the tolls for the Congestion Pricing \nProgram were impermissibly set in consideration of the financial needs of the integrated system \nof alternate transportation that would be required to accommodate displaced vehicle traffic. But \nboth federal courts and the FHWA have recognized for decades that funding the MTA works to \nreduce congestion on the roads. New York City’s transit system is inextricably interconnected, \nand there is no indication that Congress silently intended to bar such interconnected systems \nfrom consideration under the VPPP.  \n110.  Because the agency has justified its action on the basis of a legal requirement it \nhas fundamentally misconstrued, the action must set aside under the APA. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4332 \n111.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n112.  NEPA requires federal agencies, including the FHWA, to take a hard look at the \ndirect, indirect, and cumulative impacts of proposed major federal actions that significantly \naffect the quality of the human environment. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). These include the \n“reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action,” “reasonably \nforeseeable adverse effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,” and \nconsideration of alternatives. \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 31 of 32\n113.  Terminating the Congestion Pricing Program is a proposed major federal action. \n114.  Based on the Environmental Assessment that FHWA approved, the Congestion \nPricing Program produces improved air quality in the Manhattan CBD and throughout the \nregion. \n115.  Terminating the Congestion Pricing Program would naturally be expected to \naffect the quality of the human environment by reducing air quality due to a direct rise in \nvehicles miles traveled, and by depriving New Yorkers of the mitigation projects and other \nimprovements funded by the Program. \n116.  Yet Defendants did not even attempt to assess whether there would be \nenvironmental impacts, whether the impacts would rise to the level of significance, whether \nalternatives were available, or whether the public should be informed about the environmental \nconsequences of the agency’s action. \n117.  Defendants therefore violated NEPA. \nCOUNT IV \nUltra Vires \n118.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n119.  “Generally, judicial relief is available to one who has been injured by an act of a \ngovernment official which is in excess of his express or implied powers.” Harmon v. Brucker, \n355 U.S. 579, 581–82 (1958)). \n120.  There is no provision in federal law, the VPPP, or FHWA regulations that permits \nthe Secretary of Transportation or any other federal official to unilaterally revoke a VPPP \nagreement and require termination of an agreed-upon tolling program. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 41     Filed 03/28/25     Page 32 of 32\n121.  Secretary Duffy has nonetheless purported to require the unilateral recission of \nthe VPPP agreement and the end of the Congestion Pricing Program. Secretary Duffy’s actions \nare undertaken in excess of his express or implied powers and threaten to inflict injury on Riders \nAlliance and Sierra Club members.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Riders Alliance and Sierra Club respectfully request that the Court: \na)  Declare that Secretary Duffy’s decision to unilaterally revoke the VPPP and require the \nend of the Congestion Pricing Program on the basis of a pretextual and misconstrued \nlegal rationale is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; \nb)  Declare that Defendants have violated NEPA by, inter alia, failing to conduct any NEPA \nanalysis, failing to provide any opportunity for public participation, and failing to take a \n“hard look” at the potential environmental impacts of their actions; \nc)  Vacate Secreatary Duffy’s decision; \nd)  Award Riders Alliance and Sierra Club their reasonable costs of litigation, including \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412 and/or other authority; and  \ne)  Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nDated:  March 27, 2025 \nNew York, NY \nRespectfully submitted, \n \ns/Dror Ladin \nDror Ladin \nEarthjustice \n48 Wall Street, 15th Floor \nNew York, NY 10005 \n(917) 410-8701 \ndladin@earthjustice.org  \n \nCounsel for Intervenor-Plaintiffs \nRiders Alliance and Sierra Club \n32 ",

For over five years, City DOT has worked closely with the Metropolitan Transportation \nAuthority (“MTA”), the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (“TBTA”), and the New York \nState Department of Transportation (“State DOT”) to design, study, and implement Congestion \nPricing.  Much of the tolling infrastructure necessary to operate Congestion Pricing is suspended \nover public streets in the City DOT right of way, and City DOT will remain an important partner \nin deploying two regional mitigation measures and all of the place-based mitigation measures \nidentified in the Program’s environmental review.  Most critically to this action, City DOT is a \nproject sponsor of the Program and a signatory to the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”) \nagreement, which outlines the terms under which Congestion Pricing may operate, and which \nprovided federal approval for the Program before Defendants’ purported unilateral termination of \nit.  \nCity DOT may intervene as of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure because: (1) this application is timely; (2) City DOT, as a project sponsor for \nthe Program, has an interest in the continued implementation of Congestion Pricing; (3) City \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 6 of 15\nDOT’s interests are sufficiently unique from other participants to this proceeding that disposition \nof this proceeding without City DOT could impair or impede its ability to protect its interests; and \n(4) other parties may not adequately represent City DOT’s interests.  In the alternative, City DOT \nshould be granted permission to intervene under Rule 24(b)(1)(B) because its legal claims share \ncommon questions of law or fact with Plaintiffs’ claims.   \nBACKGROUND \n \nA.  Factual Background  \nCongestion Pricing is the result of the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act (“TMA”), see \nN.Y. Vehicle & Traffic L. § 1701 et seq., and has the goals of reducing traffic congestion and \nrelated air pollution in the “central business district,” which includes Manhattan roads south of \n60th Street with limited exceptions, and creating a dedicated funding source for MTA’s capital \nneeds.  TMA §§ 1701, 1704(2).   \n  Congestion  Pricing  required  federal  approval  by  the  Federal  Highway \nAdministration (“FHWA”) because it tolls certain roads that are eligible to receive federal aid.1  \nThe FHWA provided this approval on November 21, 2024, by entering into the VPPP agreement \nwith the project sponsors—TBTA, State DOT, and City DOT.  Proposed Complaint, Exhibit 2.  \nCongress established the VPPP through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991 (“ISTEA”), Pub. L. 102-240 (Dec. 18, 1991), § 1012(b), and authorized the U.S. Department \nof Transportation2 to enter into “cooperative agreements with States, local governments, or public \n \n1 As this Court is aware, Congestion Pricing underwent a years-long environmental review under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act before the FHWA issued a “finding of no significant impact” on June 28, 2023.  See 88 \nFed. Reg. 41998, 41998 (Jun. 28, 2023).  Challenges to the sufficiency of that review, among other claims, are \ncurrently before this Court in a number of matters to which City DOT is a party.  See, e.g., Chan v. U.S. Dept’t of \nTransp., et al., No. 23-10365 (LJL); Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., et al., No. 24 Civ. 1644 (LJL); and New Yorkers \nAgainst Congestion Pricing Tax, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Tansp., et al., No. 24 Civ. 367 (LJL).    \n2 The Secretary of Transportation has delegated authority to administer the VPPP to the FHWA Administrator.  See \n49 C.F.R. § 1.85(c)(22).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 7 of 15\nauthorities.”  Id. § 1012(b)(1).  “Cordon pricing” schemes, which like the Program impose tolls to \ndrive in a congested area, are eligible for the VPPP.3  VPPP revenues must be used for “projects \neligible under [Title 23],” ISTEA § 1012(b)(3), which includes public transportation projects under \n49 U.S.C. §§ 5307(a)(1) and 5337(b)(1).  \nOn January 5, 2025, Congestion Pricing began.  Preliminary data suggests the \nProgram goals are being achieved: an average of 60,000 fewer cars per day enter the district; bridge \nand tunnel travel times into the district during the morning rush hour have decreased by 9% to \n44%; January retail sales in the central business district have increased by more than $900 million \nas compared to January 2024; and attendance at Broadway shows in January and early February \nincreased by 21% as compared to the same 2024 period.  See MTA, MTA Board Meeting February \n26, 2025, at 8-10 (Feb. 26, 2025).4  \nB.  Purported Termination of the VPPP Agreement \nOn February 19, 2025, Defendant Duffy sent a letter to New York State Governor \n \n3  See  FHWA,  Report  on  the  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  Through  April  2006  at  10  (undated), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp06rpt.pdf;  FHWA, \nReport  on  the  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  Through  May  2009  at  3  (Sept.  17,  2009), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp09rpt.pdf;  FHWA, \nReport  on  the  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  Through  April  2010  at  2  (May  2010), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp10rpt.pdf;  FHWA, \nReport  on  the  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  Through  April  2012  at  11,  50  (May  2012), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp12rpt.pdf;  FHWA, \nReport  on  the  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  Through  April  2016  at  iii,  31  (undated), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp16rpt.pdf;  FHWA, \nReport  on  the  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  Through  April  2018  at  3,  35  (undated), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp18rpt.pdf;  Letters \nfrom  Deputy  Administrator  Stephanie  Pollack  to  Chair  and  Ranking  Member  of  the  Senate  Committee  on \nEnvironment and Public Works and the Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure  at  1  (each  letter)  (Feb.  16,  2022), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp20rpt.pdf;  Letters \nfrom Administrator Shailen Bhatt to Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks and the Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure at 1 (each \nletter)  (Sept.  22,  2023), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/vppp22rpt/vppp22rpt.pdf.    \n4 https://www.mta.info/document/165401.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 8 of 15\nHochul, copying City DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, advising that he was terminating the \nVPPP agreement.  Proposed Complaint, Exhibit 1.  In the letter, Duffy explained that the \ntermination was based on his view that FHWA lacked authority to enter into the VPPP and on \nPresident Donald Trump’s opposition to the Program.  Id.  That same day, President Trump stated \non social media that, “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is \nSAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING.”  On February 20, 2025, Defendant Shepard sent a letter to \nthe project sponsors, including City DOT Commissioner Rodriguez, directing the sponsors to \ncoordinate with the FHWA to cease collection of tolls under the Program by March 31, 2025.  \nProposed Complaint, Exhibit 3.  By letter dated March 20, 2025, Defendant Shepard informed the \nproject sponsors, including City DOT Commissioner Rodriguez, that she was extending the period \nof time to cease collection of tolls by thirty days, until April 20, 2025.  Proposed Complaint, \nExhibit 4.   \nC.  This Litigation \nOn February 19, 2025, MTA and TBTA filed their complaint against Defendants.  \nDkt. 1.  They allege that the purported termination of the VPPP agreement violated: (1) the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) because the Defendants lacked the authority to terminate \nthe agreement, violated regulations governing contract termination, and failed to provide an \nadequate explanation for the termination; (2) is ultra vires; (3) violated the due process clause of \nthe U.S. Constitution; and (4) failed to satisfy their environmental review obligations under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act.  Id., ¶¶ 122-183.  MTA and TBTA seek a declaration that the \npurported termination is unlawful and an order vacating same.  Id. at 50.  \nAs of the date of this filing, Defendants have not responded to the complaint.  Three \nother parties (State DOT, the Riders Alliance, and Sierra Club), have sought and been granted \nintervention.  See Dkt. 32, 36.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 9 of 15\nD.  City DOT’s Proposed Complaint \nCity DOT’s proposed complaint, Exhibit A, asserts six claims against Defendants \nherein: (1) Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP agreement violated the APA because \nDefendants’ lack the authority to terminate it (Exhibit A, ¶¶ 101-110); (2) Defendants’ purported \ntermination of the VPPP agreement violated the APA because Defendants acted contrary to \ngoverning regulations and did not provide City DOT an opportunity to be heard before the \npurported termination or to appeal same (Exhibit A, ¶¶ 119-126); (3) Defendants’ purported \ntermination of the VPPP agreement violated the APA because it failed to adequately explain \nFHWA’s reversal in position (Exhibit A, ¶¶ 135-148); (4) Defendants’ purported termination of \nthe VPPP agreement is ultra vires (Exhibit A, ¶¶ 111-118); (5) Defendants’ purported termination \nof the VPPP agreement violated City DOT’s due process rights under the U.S. Constitution \nbecause it did not afford the project sponsors sufficient process before depriving the project \nsponsors of a property interest (Exhibit A, ¶¶ 127-134); and (6) Defendants failed to satisfy their \nobligations under the National Environmental Policy Act before purporting to terminate the VPPP \nagreement (Exhibit A, ¶¶ 149-163).   \nARGUMENT \n \nCITY DOT SHOULD BE GRANTED LEAVE \nTO INTERVENE. \n \nRule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a non-party to intervene in \npending litigation as of right or by permission of the court.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.   \nA.  City DOT is Entitled to Intervene as of Right \nCity DOT is entitled to intervention as of right.  Intervention as of right may be \ngranted to a party where: (1) its motion is timely; (2) it has an interest relating to the property or \ntransaction that is the subject of the action; (3) without intervention, the disposition of the act may, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 10 of 15\nas a practical matter, impair or impede its ability to protect its interest; and (4) its interest is not \nadequately represented by the other parties.  See United States v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., 25 F.3d 66, \n70 (2d Cir. 1994).  City DOT satisfies each of these requirements.  \ni.  City DOT’s Intervention is Timely.  \n \n“The timeliness requirement is flexible and the decision is one entrusted to the \ndistrict judge’s sound discretion.”  Floyd v. City of N.Y., 770 F.3d 1051, 1058 (2d Cir. 2014) \n(quoting United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 801 F.2d 593, 594–595 (2d Cir. 1986).  Courts \ngenerally consider: “(a) the length of time the applicant knew or should have known of its interest \nbefore making the motion; (b) prejudice to existing parties resulting from the applicant’s delay; \n(c) prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied; and (d) the presence of unusual circumstances \nmilitating for or against a finding of timeliness.”  Id. (quoting MasterCard Int’l Inc. v. Visa Int’l \nServ. Ass’n, Inc., 471 F.3d 377, 390 (2d Cir. 2006).  \nEach of these considerations weigh in favor of finding that the instant motion is \ntimely.  First, City DOT moves within forty-two days of the filing of the complaint.  Second, \nDefendants will not be prejudiced by City DOT’s intervention because Defendants have not \nanswered or otherwise responded to the complaint, no issues raised in this litigation have been \ndisposed of, discovery has not commenced, and there are no motions before the Court that might \nbe affected by City DOT’s intervention.  “In other words, this litigation is in ‘its early stages’ such \nthat the motion to intervene is timely because the intervention would not significantly affect the \ncase’s manageability.” CIFI Latam, S.A. v. Tauch, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43193, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 11, 2020) (citations omitted); see also Akiachak Native Cmty. v. Dep’t of the Interior, 584 F. \nSupp. 2d 1, 5-6 (D.D.C. 2008).  Third, no unusual circumstances exist militating against a finding \nthat the instant application is timely.  Fourth, as detailed infra, City DOT will be significantly \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 11 of 15\nprejudiced if it is unable to defend its substantial interests in this proceeding.       \nii.  City DOT Has Significant Interests Relating to This Action.  \n \n“For an interest to be cognizable under Rule24(a)(2), it must be ‘direct, substantial, \nand legally protected.’”  United States v. Peoples Benefit Life Ins. Co., 271 F.3d 411, 415 (2d Cir. \n2001) (quoting Washington Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 922 \nF.2d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1990)).  “This test, however, is one of inclusion rather than exclusion.”  XL \nSpecialty Ins. Co. v. Lakian, 632 Fed. Appx. 667, 669 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal citations omitted).   \nCity DOT has a direct and substantial interest in this action.  First, City DOT has a \ndirect and substantial interest in ensuring that the VPPP agreement, to which it is a party, remains \nin effect and is not unilaterally and unlawfully terminated.  Second, City DOT has a direct interest \nin the deployment of two regional mitigation measures and, through existing City DOT programs, \nall place-based mitigation measures set forth in the Program’s environmental review.  Defendants’ \npurported termination of the VPPP agreement and this litigation risks a situation where City DOT \nmight  expend  significant  staff  time  and  resources  deploying  the  regional  and  place-based \nmitigation measures to satisfy its obligations as set forth in the environmental review of the \nProgram, but where the benefits of the Program may not be realized because it must cease \noperation.  Third, City DOT has a direct and substantial interest in ensuring it can rely on lawful \nadministrative processes.  Defendants’ attempt to unilaterally and unlawfully revoke the VPPP \nagreement, despite a years-long coordination between Defendants and the project sponsors on the \nProgram’s design, environmental review, and implementation, undermines City DOT’s ability to \nrely on federal actions at large and, ultimately, undermines the rule of law itself.  Initiatives like \nCongestion Pricing require long-term planning and coordination by various agencies—like City \nDOT—at all levels of government, but these efforts are not achievable if parties may arbitrarily \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 12 of 15\nalter course and terminate a program after it has received all lawful approvals and is implemented.     \niii.  This Action May Impair City DOT’s Interests.   \n \nThe outcome of this action will plainly impair or impede City DOT’s ability to \nprotect its interests.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).  Each of the direct and substantial interests \nidentified above will be impaired should this Court find that Defendants properly terminated the \nVPPP agreement.  \niv.  City DOT’s Interests Are Not Adequately Represented by Current Parties.   \n \nThe burden on a proposed intervenor to show inadequacy of representation by other \nparties “should be treated as minimal,” requiring only that the movant “show[] that representation \nof his interest ‘may be’ inadequate.”  Tribovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538 \nn.10 (1972); see also In re New York City Policing During Summer 2020 Demonstrations, 27 F.4th \n792, 803 (2d Cir. 2022) (quoting Tribovich); N.Y. Pub. Int. Rrch. Grp., Inc. v. Regents of the \nUniversity of the State of N.Y., 516 F.2d 350, 352 (2d Cir. 1975) (inadequate representation occurs \nwhen an intervenor may make “more vigorous representation” of an argument than existing \nparties).   \nHere, City DOT’s interests are sufficiently distinct from existing litigants that their \ninterests may not be adequately represented.  For example, MTA and TBTA may elect to \nemphasize the financial impacts to New York’s public transit system should the purported \ntermination of the VPPP agreement be upheld.  See, e.g., Dkt 1 at ¶ 12.  State DOT has indicated \nthat it may emphasize arguments addressing its sovereign interest in this litigation.  Dkt. 31 at 12.  \nThe Riders Alliance and Sierra Club have indicated that they may emphasize arguments addressing \nthe Program’s environmental benefits.  Dkt. 24 at 13.  Each of these important interests are distinct \nfrom those raised by City DOT above, and without City DOT’s participation in this litigation, its \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 13 of 15\nown interests—including those related to the deployment of certain regional and all place-based \nmitigation measures—may not be sufficiently addressed because of other litigants’ focus on \neconomic, environmental, or sovereign interests. See Tribovich, 404 U.S. at n.10; N.Y. Pub. Int. \nRrch. Grp., Inc., 516 F.2d at 352. \nCity DOT has established its entitlement to intervene as of right, and it respectfully \nrequests this Court grant its motion to do so.     \nB.  City DOT Should Be Granted Permissive Intervention.  \nIn the alternative, City DOT should be permitted intervention pursuant to Rule \n24(b)(1), which permits courts to grant intervention to anyone “who…has a claim or defense that \nshares with the main action a common question of law or fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1).  \n“Permissive intervention is wholly discretionary with the trial court[,]” U.S. Postal Serv. v. \nBrennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 (2d Cir. 1978), and may be granted after consideration of “whether \nthe intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3).  “Rule 24(b)(2) is to be liberally construed in favor of intervention.”  \nHuman Servs. Council v. City of New York, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178058, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. \n22, 2022).  “It is well-established by district courts in the Second Circuit that ‘[t]he words “claim \nor defense” are not read in a technical sense, but only require some interest on the part of the \napplicant.’”  Bldg. & Realty Inst. v. New York, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174577, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept. 23, 2020) (collecting cases).   \nCity DOT should be permitted intervention in this action.  As detailed above, City \nDOT’s intervention will not unduly delay adjudication of any issues at bar or prejudice the interest \nof a party to this action.  Importantly, City DOT’s claims are closely related to those asserted by \nother parties, namely MTA, TBTA and State DOT, because they share a question of law and fact: \nwhether Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP agreement is lawful.  City DOT, like other \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 46     Filed 04/02/25     Page 14 of 15\nplaintiffs herein, seeks declaratory relief and vacatur on that issue.  Permitting City DOT’s \nintervention therefore serves the purpose of judicial economy and efficiency and prevents a \nmultiplicity of suits where common questions of law or fact are involved.  See Washington Elec. \nCoop., Inc., 922 F.2d at 97.  \nAccordingly, City DOT respectfully requests this Court’s permission to intervene.  \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, City DOT respectfully requests that the Court permit its \nintervention under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n \n \nDated:    New York, New York  \nApril 2, 2025 \nMURIEL GOODE-TRUFANT \nCorporation Counsel of the City of New York \n \nBy: __________________________ \nNathan Taylor \nAssistant Corporation Counsel \nntaylor@law.nyc.gov \nChristian C.

LIMAN, United States District Judge: \n \nProposed Intervenor-Plaintiff New York City Department of Transportation \n(“NYCDOT”) moves for leave to intervene in the above-captioned case, pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 24.  Dkt. Nos. 45–46.  The Court directed any party intending to oppose \nNYCDOT’s motion to inform the Court of that intention no later than April 7, 2025.  Dkt. No. 48.  \nNo party did so, and the Court thus considers NYCDOT’s motion to be unopposed.  The Court \ngrants NYCDOT’s motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) states in relevant part that “[up]on timely motion, \nthe court may permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the \nmain action a common question of law or fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  The Court has “broad \ndiscretion” to grant or deny the motion.  AT & T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 407 F.3d 560, 561 (2d Cir. \n2005); Bldg. & Realty Inst. of Westchester & Putnam Ctys., Inc. v. State of New York, 2020 WL \n5658703, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2020). \nNYCDOT’s application is timely.  See Green v. Biden, 2024 WL 4932751, at *7 \n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2024) (“Proposed Intervenors timely filed their motion before Defendants even \nfiled their Answer.”).  “The principal guide in deciding whether to grant permissive intervention \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 55     Filed 04/09/25     Page 2 of 2\nis whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the \noriginal parties.”  United States v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., 25 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 1994) (quotation \nomitted); Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3).  No party has identified any potential prejudice to the \nadjudication of their rights and there is no undue delay given the early posture of this case. \n“The words ‘claim or defense’ are not ‘read in a technical sense, but only require some \ninterest on the part of the applicant.’”  United States v. NYCHA, 326 F.R.D. 411, 418 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (quoting Louis Berger Grp., Inc. v. State Bank of India, 802 F.Supp.2d 482, 488 (S.D.N.Y. \n2011)).  NYCDOT’s claims “share the same fundamental question of law with the main suit.”  \n335-7 LLC v. City of New York, 2020 WL 3100085, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2020); see Blatch v. \nFranco, 1998 WL 265132, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 1998) (Chin, J.) (“[I]ntervention is \nappropriate here where the intervenors seek virtually the same relief as the named plaintiffs.”); \ncompare Dkt. No. 1 with Dkt. No. 45-1.  Permissive intervention is further appropriate where, as \nhere, the applicant’s interest will be finally determined by the suit.  See Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Just., 161 F.R.D. 247, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (Sotomayor, J.) (citing Arizona v. \nCalifornia, 460 U.S. 605, 615 (1983)).  NYCDOT is a party to the Value Pricing Pilot Program \nagreement at issue and has an interest in determining the status of that agreement.  Dkt. No. 46. \nBecause the Court grants NYCDOT’s motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24(b), the Court need not consider NYCDOT’s argument that intervention is also \nwarranted as a matter of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). \nThe Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt. No. 45. \n \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: April 9, 2025            __________________________________ \n  New York, New York            LEWIS J. LIMAN \n                   United States District Judge  ",

Liman    \nUnited States District Court Southern District of New York  \n500 Pearl Street, Courtroom 15C  \nNew York, NY 10007  \n \nRe:   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, et al. v. Duffy, et al., No. 25 \nCiv. 1413 (LJL)  \n \nDear Judge Liman: \n \nI write on behalf of Plaintiff-Intervenors Riders Alliance and Sierra Club \nregarding the Defendants’ letter motion for permanent sealing of ECF No. 65. \nWhile counsel for Plaintiff-Intervenors has followed Defendants’ request and has \nnot downloaded the document, it is my understanding that the document has \nalready been widely disseminated. Defendants’ letter motion likewise confirms \nthat the “contents of the document have been made public in news reporting.” ECF \nNo. 67.  \n \nThe document’s public dissemination and the numerous news articles \ndiscussing and publishing its contents create a situation that appears quite unlike \nthe filing error discussed in Mazzocchi v. Windsor Owners Corp., No. 11 Civ. \n07913 (RA)(SDA), 2020 WL 4038342, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2020). Instead, the \npresent circumstances more closely resemble those confronted by the Second \nCircuit in Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 144 (2d Cir. 2004), where \nthe court considered a reported-upon disclosure and determined that it could not \n“make what has thus become public private again.” As the court explained, “[t]his \nis generally so when information that is supposed to be confidential—whether it be \nsettlement terms of a discrimination lawsuit or the secret to making the hydrogen \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 68     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 2\nbomb, is publicly disclosed. Once it is public, it necessarily remains public.” Id. at \nn.11.; see also, e.g., Constand v. Cosby, 833 F.3d 405, 410 (3d Cir. 2016) (“In light \nof the extensive publicity . . . we are similarly without power to affect the \ndissemination of the unsealed documents’ contents in any meaningful way.”); Doe \nNo. 1 v. Reed, 697 F.3d 1235, 1240 (9th Cir. 2012) (describing “commonsense \nconclusion that once a fact is widely available to the public, a court cannot grant \nany ‘effective relief’ to a person seeking to keep that fact a secret.”). \n \nTherefore, as I informed Defendants’ counsel earlier this morning, it is not \nclear that ECF No. 65 may be properly subject to a permanent sealing order.  \nPlaintiff-Intervenors Riders Alliance and Sierra Club respectfully request that the \nCourt provide an opportunity for discussion and consideration of how to proceed \nunder these circumstances.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \ns/Dror Ladin \nDror Ladin \nEarthjustice \n48 Wall Street, 15th Floor \nNew York, NY 10005 \n(917) 410-8701 \ndladin@earthjustice.org  \n \nCounsel for Intervenor-Plaintiffs \nRiders Alliance and Sierra Club \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n ",

Duffy, et al., No. 25 Civ. 1413 \n(LJL) \n \nDear Judge Liman: \nThis Office represents defendants Sean Duffy, in his official capacity as Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Gloria M. Shepherd, in her official capacity \nas Executive Director of the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), DOT, and FHWA \n(together the “Federal Defendants”) in the above-referenced matter.  We write respectfully to \nrequest that the Court remove or permanently seal ECF No. 65, which is an attorney-client \nprivileged / attorney work product communication that was inadvertently filed on the docket in \nthis matter last night.   \nAt 9:04 p.m. last night, undersigned counsel inadvertently uploaded an attorney-client \ncommunication from this Office to DOT to ECF rather than a letter intended for Your Honor.1 \nImmediately upon realizing this error, at 9:18 p.m., we contacted all counsel of record via email \nadvising of this inadvertent filing of a privileged communication and requesting that they not \ndownload the document, or if they had downloaded it, to delete it.  We also immediately took steps \nto contact the Clerk’s office to have the document removed, and we understand that by 9:48 p.m. \nthe Clerk’s office had put a temporary seal on the document, and it was no longer available on \nECF. Although the contents of the document have been made public in news reporting, the \ndocument was filed in error and should not be considered part of the court docket.   \nAccordingly, we respectfully request that the Court remove or permanently seal ECF No. \n65 and hold that the inadvertent filing does not constitute a waiver of the attorney client privilege.  \nSee Mazzocchi v. Windsor Owners Corp., No. 11 Civ. 07913 (RA)(SDA), 2020 WL 4038342, at \n*3  (S.D.N.Y.  July  17,  2020)  (rejecting  argument  that  inadvertent  filing  of  attorney-client \nprivileged communication on the public docket constituted waiver, and ordering Clerk of the Court \nto maintain the privileged document under seal (citing Fed. R. Evid. 502(b),  (d))). We have \nreached out to counsel for Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenors to confirm whether they consent to \nthe requested relief.  At this time we have heard back only from counsel for Intervenor  Plaintiffs \n \n1 The correct letter was later filed at ECF No. 66.   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 67     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 2\nPage 2 \n \nSierra Club and Riders Alliance and Plaintiffs MTA and TBTA who have indicated that they would \nbe open to discussing the issue of whether the document should remain under seal.  Plaintiffs MTA \nand TBTA do not object to temporary sealing pending further consideration by the parties and the \nCourt.   \nThe Federal Defendants do not believe further discussion among the parties is necessary \ngiven that the document is a privileged communication, was plainly filed in error, and the \nGovernment took immediate steps to notify the parties and have the document removed from the \ndocket, and therefore the document should not be available to the other parties or the Court for \nconsideration  in  this  matter.  See  SDNY  ECF  Rules  &  Instructions,  Section  21.7;  see  also \nMazzocchi, 2020 WL 4038342, at *3 (citing Fed. R.

On January 5, 2025, the State of New York embarked on a bold new program to \nreduce traffic congestion in the New York City metropolitan area and fund and promote mass \ntransportation with the Central Business District (“CBD”) Tolling Program (“Program”), also \nknown as Congestion Pricing, a market-based, user-pay solution that has seen success in major \ncities around the world.  The Program accomplishes its aims by tolling eligible vehicles entering \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 2 of 51\n \nthe CBD in order to encourage mass transportation and using that money to support the City’s \ntransportation infrastructure.  In a matter of weeks, the Program has already achieved remarkable \nresults: traffic congestion and commute times have materially fallen; more people are visiting \nManhattan’s commercial districts and supporting the region’s businesses; and the MTA’s vital mass \ntransit system is seeing the benefit of increased funding.  Despite its obvious success, however, the \nTrump  Administration  has  precipitously—and  for  blatantly  political  reasons—purported  to  \n“terminate” the Program, as then-candidate Trump proclaimed he would do in his first week in \noffice.    The  Administration’s  efforts  to  summarily  and  unilaterally  overturn  the  considered \ndeterminations of the political branches—federal, state, and city—are unlawful, and the Court \nshould declare that they are null and void. \n2.  The Manhattan CBD is one of the most congested urban areas in the country, where \ntravel times had been extraordinarily slow for decades.  Indeed, the term “gridlock” was invented \nright here in Manhattan.  Congestion in the CBD has been a $20 billion annual drag on the regional \neconomy, and thus the national economy, as well.  For over 50 years, New York state and local \nofficials, policy experts, and advocacy groups have studied various solutions to identify the most \neffective way to reduce congestion, which results in lost productivity, poor air quality, slower and \nless reliable bus service, delayed emergency response times, and reduced public safety, among other \nharmful conditions.  That extensive deliberation led to the consensus that congestion pricing—\ncharging vehicles to drive in highly congested areas and providing a dedicated source of funding \nfor public transit for the metropolitan area—is the most effective tool to achieve that goal.  That \nexpert consensus also makes good common sense.  Traffic congestion and public transit are \ninextricably linked: to reduce traffic, the region needs to improve the reliability of its transit system, \nwhich is chronically underfunded and in need of capital investment.   \n  2   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 3 of 51\n \n3.  In April 2019, the New York Legislature and then-Governor Andrew Cuomo \npassed the Traffic Mobility Act (“TMA”), a landmark statute with the goal of reducing traffic \ncongestion in the CBD and creating a dedicated funding source for the MTA’s capital needs.  \nN.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 1701 et seq.  The TMA authorized and directed TBTA, the MTA’s \nindependent affiliate, to establish and operate a congestion pricing program, including tolling of \neligible vehicles entering or remaining in the CBD, and earmarked the revenues from the Program \nfor  the  MTA’s  2020-2024  Capital  Program  (the  “Capital  Program”)  and  subsequent  capital \nprograms.   \n4.  Several months later, in June 2019, New York State, through the New York State \nDepartment of Transportation (“NYSDOT”), TBTA, and the New York City Department of \nTransportation  (“NYCDOT”)  (collectively,  the  “Project  Sponsors”),  submitted  to  FHWA  an \nExpression of Interest for authority to assess tolls on vehicles entering the CBD under the federal \nValue Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”).  The VPPP is a program created by Congress under which \nFHWA may authorize tolling of federal aid highways to reduce roadway congestion and improve \nair quality, including through congestion pricing strategies.  It has been used across the country to \nauthorize tolling to reduce congestion, improve the environment, and raise funds.   \n5.  Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et \nseq.,  FHWA  was  required  to  evaluate  the  potential  environmental  effects  of  the  Program, \nincluding—as directed by a former Executive Order that has since been revoked by President \nTrump—the Program’s potential to have a disproportionately high and adverse impact on minority \nand low-income (i.e., environmental justice, or “EJ”) populations and communities that have pre-\nexisting pollution and health burdens due to historic transportation and land use decisions.   \n  3   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 4 of 51\n \n6.  Following a multi-year environmental review process from 2019 into 2023 that \nyielded an administrative record of more than 45,000 pages, FHWA and the Project Sponsors \nprepared a 958-page Final Environmental Assessment (“Final EA”), followed by a Finding of No \nSignificant Impact (“FONSI”) and two Re-Evaluations, which determined that the Program would \nnot have a significant adverse impact on the environment or a disproportionately high and adverse \nimpact on EJ communities in light of (1) the anticipated reduction of overall vehicle miles traveled \n(“VMT”) and vehicular emissions in the region, and (2) the Project Sponsors’ commitment to a \nrobust, $155 million mitigation package to improve air quality and public health in EJ communities \nwhich have pre-existing pollution and health burdens and could receive traffic diversions as a result \nof the Program.   \n7.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA executed the VPPP Agreement with the Project \nSponsors, see Exhibit A, which authorized the Program’s collection of tolls and required (among \nother things) implementation of the Project Sponsors’ mitigation commitments and regular reports \nto FHWA on the Program’s effects.   \n8.  The Program went into effect on January 5, 2025, and eligible vehicles entering the \nCBD are being tolled in accordance with the toll rate schedule adopted by the TBTA Board and \nauthorized in the VPPP Agreement.  Already, preliminary data for January 2025 (and simply \nlooking at the roads) show that the Program is working.   \n9.  Traffic congestion and travel times are down substantially, making commutes more \nefficient.  Almost 1.2 million fewer vehicles entered the CBD in the month of January than would \nbe expected without the Program.  Crossing times were 17% faster at the Lincoln Tunnel and 48% \nfaster at the Holland Tunnel in January 2025 compared to January 2024.  Trip times on the \nWilliamsburg Bridge and Queensboro Bridge have been 30% faster.  Drivers are saving on average \n  4   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 5 of 51\n \n20 to 30 minutes driving into the CBD.  Within the CBD, weekday daytime travel speeds were 14% \nfaster during the second week of the Program, and 12% faster in the third week.  Weekend daytime \ntravel within the CBD was 15% faster during the second week of the Program, and 18% faster \nduring the third week.  Meanwhile, more people are taking mass transit options.  Compared to \nJanuary 2024, weekday bus ridership has grown by 7%, and weekend express bus ridership is up \n21%.  Ridership on the MTA’s two commuter railroads, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-\nNorth Railroad, was up by 11% and 7% respectively in January 2025, as compared to January 2024.  \nSimilarly, subway ridership has grown by 7.3% on weekdays and 12% on weekends.  \n10.  Businesses are benefiting from the Program as well.  Crain’s New York Business \nreports that more people visited the Business Improvement Districts (“BIDs”) within the CBD in \nJanuary 2025 than during the same month last year, noting a 4.6% year-over-year increase in \nvisitation.1  Indeed, while vehicle traffic may be down in Manhattan, Gothamist notes, “pedestrian \ntraffic is up.”2  Data from the Broadway League, meanwhile, shows that there was a 17% increase \nin attendance for Broadway theatre performances in January 2025, as well as a 25% increase in \ngross revenue.3  \n11.   Business leaders have voiced their support for the Program, recognizing the \nbenefits of Congestion Pricing for businesses in the CBD and the broader economy.  Greater New \nYork Chamber of Commerce CEO Mark Jaffe has stated that the Program “will improve the quality \n \n1 Caroline Spivack, Business Foot Traffic Is Up Within the Congestion Pricing Zone, CRAIN’S N.Y.

The region’s subways, buses, and commuter railroads—vital lifelines for so many \nNew Yorkers who live in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond—are already benefiting \nfrom substantial investments that have been made as a result of the Program. In particular, key \ntenets of the Capital Program include improving outdated signaling and other equipment to increase \nsystem reliability; improving safety and customer service through technology; and extending public \ntransit to under-served areas.  Program revenue will also be used to update and renovate numerous \nsubway stations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, by building new elevators at \n70 stations across the boroughs and replacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators—bringing the \ntransportation system to greater than 50% accessibility. \n \n4 New York’s Chamber (@NYChamber), X, (Nov. 15, 2024, 3:29 PM), \nhttps://x.com/NYChamber/status/1857521387583451602.  \n5 Louisa Chafee, Andrew Rein, & Kathryn Wylde, Op-ed: Congestion Pricing Will Be a Boon for New York, \nPFNYC.ORG (Nov. 14, 2014), https://pfnyc.org/news/op-ed-congestion-pricing-will-be-a-boon-for-new-york/.  \n6 Ry Rivard & Nick Reisman, New York’s business boosters push Trump to keep Manhattan tolls, POLITICO (Feb. \n11, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/new-york-trump-congestion-pricing-00203540.  \n  6   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 7 of 51\n \n13.  Program  revenue  will  also  be  used  to  advance  the  $155  million  package  of \nmitigation for EJ communities, which is designed to address preexisting pollution and chronic \nhealth burdens.  These measures will include replacing diesel engines with cleaner technology; \ninstalling electric charging infrastructure for trucks; planting roadside vegetation to improve near-\nroad air quality; and installing air filtration units in schools near highways.  \n14.  TBTA has issued debt that is supported by revenues generated by the Program and \nby long-term bonds issued partly in reliance on revenues generated by the Program.  This includes \nno less than $378.8 million in short-term notes currently outstanding to fund infrastructure costs, \nand $500 million in short-term notes to fund a portion of the $15 billion of capital projects in the \nCapital Program.  By the end of the month, TBTA also expects to close a $500 million bank loan \nto support the Capital Program, relying on Program revenues as security. \n15.  New Yorkers support the Program because it is working.  According to a poll \nreported by CBS News, the majority of New Yorkers want the Program to continue.7  On a 2-to-1 \nbasis, New Yorkers say that the Program is working.8  The Program’s biggest supporters are the \nindividuals who actually drive into the CBD frequently.9  Ultimately, 6 out of every 10 New \nYorkers say that President Trump should not take any steps to end the Program.10 \n16.  Notwithstanding the extensive evaluations—and now early results—showing that \nCongestion Pricing is the best way to reduce congestion in the CBD, reduce overall vehicle \nemissions in the greater region, and fund the regional mass transit system, the Program has \ncontinued to have its political detractors, including President Trump.  As early as May 2024, \n \n7Alecia Reid, 6 in 10 Say They Want NYC Congestion Pricing to Continue, New Poll Finds, CBS NEWS (Feb. 5, \n2025), https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/newyork/news/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-morning-consult-poll/.   \n8 Id.  \n9 Id. \n10 Id. \n  7   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 8 of 51\n \nPresident Trump posted on “Truth Social” that he would “TERMINATE Congestion Pricing in my \nFIRST WEEK back in Office,” and subsequent media reports—from the President and his allies in \nCongress—have indicated that the Administration intended to immediately and summarily end \nCongestion Pricing to achieve political objectives.   \n17.  On  February  19,  2025,  the  Trump  Administration  attempted  to  do  just  that.  \nSpecifically, Defendants issued a letter to Governor Hochul purporting to rescind the VPPP \nAgreement in an effort to “terminate” the Program (the “Challenged Action”).   \n18.  The  Trump  Administration’s  efforts  to  “terminate”  Congestion  Pricing  are \nunlawful. \n19.  Neither the VPPP Agreement nor applicable law or regulations permit FHWA to \nunilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement.  This makes good sense.  If FHWA had the right to \nunilaterally terminate a VPPP program that had already been approved and implemented, it would \ncreate uncertainty around the future of such programs any time leadership at FHWA, USDOT, or \nthe White House changed—uncertainty that may make it difficult to issue bonds for other projects \nand would clearly undermine the purposes of the VPPP. \n20.  Defendants also provided no basis for FHWA’s abrupt reversal of its position on \nthe Program, despite having reaffirmed the FONSI and approved the Program only a few months \nprior.  And, in stark contrast to the nearly four-year process that led to FHWA’s VPPP approval, \nDefendants purported to take this agency action in a matter of less than two months, and despite \nhaving conducted no NEPA review of the effects on the environment from ceasing tolling and \nreintroducing tens of thousands of additional vehicular trips into the CBD daily, as well as from \ntermination of the EJ mitigation committed to as part of the Program and to be funded through \nProgram revenue.   \n  8   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 9 of 51\n \n21.  In short, FHWA’s decision to purportedly terminate the VPPP Agreement is in open \ndisregard of a host of federal statutes and regulations, not to mention the MTA and TBTA’s rights \nunder the United States Constitution.   \n22.  Though the FHWA’s attempt to terminate the Program is clearly contrary to law, it \nis perhaps unsurprising given that the Trump Administration has attempted to take a number of \nunilateral executive actions that have been challenged in and stopped by the courts.11  These actions \ninclude attempts to freeze federal funding despite prior Congressional appropriations, to cut funding \nfrom the National Institutes of Health, and to redefine the Fourteenth Amendment’s citizenship \nguarantee in a move that one court called “blatantly unconstitutional.”12  In many of these instances, \nthe effect of the arbitrary or unlawful federal action was to hamstring vital funding sources for states \nand localities—regardless of legal commitments the federal government has made.  The Trump \nAdministration’s action here is just the latest example of its disregard for the rule of law. \n23.  Termination of the Program is also in direct contrast with the USDOT’s newly \nannounced policy to “prioritize” projects “that utilize user-pay models,” and recent remarks by \nDefendant Duffy that saving people time on their commutes would be part of his mission as \n \n11 See, e.g., Washington v.

At a conference of state highway and transportation officials on February 5, 2025, \nDefendant Duffy stated that he wanted to commit to create projects that “mak[e] peoples lives \nbetter. What you do makes people’s lives better. We’re able to get to work and back home to see \nour loved ones more quickly. If we don’t have our systems that are delayed and we don’t sit in \ntraffic we get to spend an extra 15 minutes, maybe an extra 45 minutes a day with the ones that we \nlove as opposed to listening to music or a podcast or, I don’t know what you listen to in the car, but \nwhatever you’re listening to in the car, or on the train. We can make people’s lives better and spend \ntime with the people we love as opposed to going to the grind of our transportation system.”13 \n24.  In addition to being inconsistent with its own broader policy statements, the Trump \nAdministration’s efforts to “terminate” the Program are contrary to its purported respect for \nfederalism.  The Program is the first congestion pricing program of its kind in the United States, \nand a necessary solution to the unique policy challenges facing the New York metropolitan region \nand one that reflects the will of the majority of New Yorkers and their elected representatives at \nevery level of government.  As Justice Brandeis explained nearly a century ago, “[i]t is one of the \nhappy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve \nas a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the \ncountry.”  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 597 n.20 (1977) (quoting New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J. dissenting)).  President Trump claims to embrace this \nphilosophy and has even pledged, in his own signature way, to “make states the laboratories of \ndemocracy once again.”14  In his first inaugural address, President Trump declared that “we are not \n \n13 Sean Duffy, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy speaks at the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation  Officials  2025  Washington  Briefing,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Transp.

To be clear, while the Trump Administration has purported to unlawfully terminate \nthe VPPP agreement, its actions—as a mere signatory to a multi-party agreement—obviously do \nnot require Plaintiffs to cease operation of the Program.  The status quo is that Congestion Pricing \ncontinues, and unless and until a court orders otherwise, Plaintiffs will continue to operate the \nProgram as required by New York law.  \n26.

New York’s Enactment of Congestion Pricing \n35.  Traffic congestion has long plagued the New York metropolitan area.  For decades, \ncongestion has stymied economic growth and harmed the environment and public health, not to \nmention the quality of life in the region.   \n36.  Congestion on New York City roads, and in the CBD in particular, has a serious \nnegative impact on public health.  As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized, \nhigher vehicle traffic leads to higher vehicle emissions, which are associated with negative health \nimpacts  like  “asthma  onset  and  aggravation,  cardiovascular  disease,  reduced  lung  function, \nimpaired lung development in children, pre-term and low-birthweight infants, childhood leukemia, \nand premature death.”17  FHWA has consistently acknowledged that “less vehicle traffic can \nimprove air quality and reduce chronic lower respiratory diseases.”18  \n37.  Congestion also increases travel times, eroding worker productivity, reducing bus \nand paratransit service, raising the cost of deliveries, and impeding the movement of emergency \nvehicles.  A 2018 study estimated that “traffic congestion [would] be a $100 billion drag” on the \nmetropolitan-area economy over the next five years, and identified Manhattan below 60th street—\nwhere a quarter of the economic activity is concentrated—as  the  primary  source  of  traffic \ncongestion in the region.19   \n38.  New York policy makers have considered ways to reduce congestion in the CBD, \n \n17 U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, NEAR ROADWAY AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH: FREQUENTLY \nASKED QUESTIONS (Aug. 2014), https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100NFFD.PDF?Dockey=P100NFFD.PDF. \n18 Jhoset Burgos-Rodriguez, et al., Making Healthy Connections in Transportation, 87 PUBLIC ROADS 28 (Summer \n2023), https://highways.dot.gov/sites/fhwa.dot.gov/files/Public%20Roads%20Summer%202023.pdf. \n19 The Partnership for New York City, $100 Billion Cost of Traffic Congestion in Metro New York, PFNYC.ORG \n(Jan. 2018) https://pfnyc.org/research/100-billion-cost-of-traffic-congestion-in-metro-new-york/.  \n  13   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 14 of 51\n \nincluding tolling programs, for decades.  In fact, the idea for congestion pricing was first developed \nin the 1950s by Columbia University economist and Nobel laureate William S. Vickrey, who \nbelieved that congestion pricing would be a market-based solution to overcrowding, whether on \nsubway cars or New York City’s streets. \n39.  The last decade has seen further recognition of the benefits that a congestion pricing \nprogram could have for reducing congestion in the city, improving air quality, and raising funds \nto improve mass transit.  As New Yorkers faced serious mass transit issues in 2017, Governor \nAndrew Cuomo raised the possibility of implementing a congestion pricing program that would \nhelp fund improvements to New York City’s transit infrastructure.  Governor Cuomo instituted an \nadvisory panel which recommended a congestion pricing program. \n40.  In 2019, the New York State Legislature enacted the TMA, which authorized and \ndirected TBTA to implement a congestion tolling program in the CBD.  N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law \n§ 1701 et seq.  The TMA’s legislative findings declare that traffic in New York—which “ranks \nsecond worst among cities in the United States and third worst among cities in the world” and is \nestimated to cost the metropolitan economy more than “one hundred billion dollars over the next \nfive years”—is “crippling ... [for] residents, commuters, taxi and for-hire vehicle traffic, bus transit \nand emergency services” and “a significant contributor to decreased air quality.”  Id. § 1701.   \n41.  The Legislature further found that the underfunding of New York City’s aging \nsubway infrastructure has “a deleterious impact on the health, safety, and livelihood of commuters, \ntourists, resident New Yorkers” as well as “the economy of the state of New York,” such that “a \nlong-term and sustainable solution is necessary in order to ensure stable and reliable funding” for \nthis “important mass transit asset.”  Id.  Consequently, the Legislature declared that to ensure the \n  14   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 15 of 51\n \n“public health and safety of New York’s residents,” the creation of a congestion pricing program \nin the Manhattan CBD was “a matter of substantial state concern.”  Id. \n42.  The TMA authorizes and directs TBTA to “establish the central business district \ntolling program,” id. § 1704 (1), grants TBTA the power “to establish and charge variable tolls and \nfees for vehicles entering or remaining in the [CBD],”20 and authorizes TBTA “to make rules and \nregulations for the establishment and collection of central business district tolls, fees, and other \ncharges,” id. § 1704-a (1).   \nB.  The Federal Value Pricing Pilot Program \n43.  Because Congestion Pricing would impose a toll on several federal-aid highways \nin Manhattan, the federal government has taken the position that the Program could not begin \nwithout federal approval.  Mulgrew v. United States Dep’t of Transp., No. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL \n3251732, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2024) (Liman, J.).  \n44.  Tolls are generally prohibited on federal-aid highways, subject to a number of \nexceptions found in federal law, including exceptions that authorize tolling on new infrastructure, \ntolling on additional lanes added to existing highways, and tolling in connection with high-\noccupancy vehicle lanes.  See 23 U.S.C. §§ 129, 301.   \n45.  In 1991, Congress enacted the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991, Pub. L. 102-240 (Dec. 18, 1991) (“ISTEA”), which permits tolling on federal-aid highways \nin connection with pilot projects seeking to reduce congestion.   \n46.  Specifically,  ISTEA established the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, which \ndirected the Secretary of Transportation to “solicit the participation of State and local governments \n \n20 As delineated by the Act, the CBD encompasses the geographic area of Manhattan south and inclusive of 60th \nStreet, but not including the FDR Drive, the West Side Highway, the Battery Park Underpass, and any surface roadway \nportion of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel connecting to West Street.  Id. § 1704(2). \n  15   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 16 of 51\n \nand public authorities for one or more congestion pricing pilot projects,” and authorized the \nSecretary to “enter into” agreements to “establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing \nprojects.”  ISTEA § 1012(b).  ISTEA further authorized the Secretary “to allow the use of tolls” by \nstates, local governments, and public authorities “as part of a pilot program under this section,” id.  \n47.  In 1998, Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of \n1998,  which  renamed  the  Congestion  Pricing  Pilot  Program  the  VPPP  and  expanded  the \nSecretary’s authority to enter into agreements authorizing value pricing pilot programs.  Pub. L. \n105-178 § 1216 (June 9, 1998). \n48.  As FHWA describes it, the VPPP is “intended to demonstrate whether and to what \nextent roadway congestion may be reduced through application of congestion pricing strategies, \nand the magnitude of the impact of such strategies on driver behavior, traffic volumes, transit \nridership,  air  quality  and  availability  of  funds  for  transportation  programs.”21    FHWA  has \nrecognized that congestion pricing can reduce delays and stress, allow for more deliveries per hour \nfor businesses, improve transit speeds and reliability of service, and save lives by shortening the \nincident response times for ambulances and emergency personnel.22   \n49.  According to FHWA, “congestion pricing ... is a way of harnessing the power of \nthe market to reduce the waste associated with traffic congestion.”23  Congestion pricing is \neffective because it shifts “some rush hour highway travel to other transportation modes or to off-\n \n21 Value Pricing Pilot Program, U.S. FED.

By removing even just a small fraction of the vehicles from a congested roadway, \npricing helps the system to flow more efficiently.”  Id. \n50.  The Secretary of Transportation has delegated the authority to administer the VPPP, \nand to enter into agreements under Section 1012(b) of ISTEA, to the FHWA Administrator.  See \n49 C.F.R. § 1.85(c)(22).  FHWA provides tolling authority under the VPPP by entering into tolling \nagreements with the relevant state actors.  See Value Pricing Pilot Program Participation, Fiscal \nYears 2010 and 2011, 75 F.R. 64397, 64403 (Nov. 19, 2010). \n51.  Several  states  have  taken  advantage  of  the  VPPP.    For  example,  Texas  has \nestablished a program under the VPPP that examined potential congestion pricing incentives and \nprograms on the IH-30/Tom Landry Highway.  Similarly, Florida has established a project \nexamining the potential for a congestion pricing program on the Florida Turnpike System.  After \nless than two years, the 95 Express project in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida saw total \nridership on the Bus Rapid Transit “increase[] by 145 percent,” along with “dramatic improvement \nin express lane travel speeds along the corridor utilized by transit,” with average speeds during \nmorning peak time increasing from 20 to 62 miles per hour.  Id.  FHWA has not rescinded tolling \nauthority for any of these projects. \n52.  Indeed, on information and belief, FHWA has never attempted to unilaterally \nrescind tolling authority for any VPPP program or project.  FHWA has never publicly announced \na unilateral rescission of tolling authority for a VPPP program or project in the Federal Register \nor on its public-facing website.  Nor has FHWA ever reported such a rescission in its regular \nreports to Congress on the status of the VPPP.   \nC.  FHWA and the Project Sponsors Conducted a Lengthy Environmental Review \nProcess  \n53.  In 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted an Expression of Interest to FHWA seeking \n  17   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 18 of 51\n \nauthorization to implement a variable tolling program aimed at reducing congestion (i.e., a \ncongestion pricing program) in the Manhattan CBD.  FHWA responded that the VPPP “appear[ed] \nto be the best potential fit” among the various programs in Federal law allowing for tolling on \nFederal-aid highways. \n54.  A years-long environmental review process under NEPA ensued.  In assessing the \nProgram, FHWA specifically considered the Program’s purpose “to reduce traffic congestion in the \n[CBD] in a manner that will generate revenue for future transportation improvements,” and its \nspecific objectives of: (1) reducing daily VMT within the CBD by at least five percent; (2) reducing \nthe number of vehicles entering the CBD daily by at least ten percent; and (3) creating a funding \nsource for capital improvements and generating sufficient annual net revenues to fund $15 billion \nfor capital projects.24  \n55.  On August 10, 2022, FHWA and the Project Sponsors issued a Draft Environmental \nAnalysis (“Draft EA”), which was informed by early public outreach and comments as well as \ncomplex and comprehensive technical analyses.  The Draft EA examined numerous categories of \npotential environmental effects, such as the visual effects of tolling infrastructure, the indirect air \nquality and noise effects of changes in traffic patterns, and the effects on transit systems of shifts in \ntravel mode choice.  In accordance with former Executive Order (“EO”) 12,898 (1994), the Draft \nEA also studied the potential for disproportionately high and adverse effects on EJ communities, \nincluding the potential effects of traffic diversions on local air quality in the locations throughout \nthe region most likely to experience diversions. \n \n24 See FHWA et al., Central Business District Tolling Program, Finding of No Significance, Appendix A: Final \nEnvironmental Assessment at ES-6, MTA.INFO (June 14, 2024), \nhttps://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/environmental-assessment.  \n  18   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 19 of 51\n \n56.  Because the tolling structure was not yet established when the Draft EA was issued, \nand in order to allow FHWA and the Project Sponsors to better assess the range of potential impacts \nfrom the Program, the Draft EA analyzed seven tolling scenarios, each with different variables, \nusing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved traffic and air quality models to predict \nchanges in regional travel demand and patterns for those scenarios, as compared to predicted \nconditions in 2023 and 2045 without the Program.  It then studied the scenarios that yielded the \nrepresentative worst-case effects for different resource categories (e.g., traffic, noise, etc.) to \nconsider the full range of potential effects from the Program.  The Draft EA also identified measures \nto mitigate potential adverse environmental effects and potential effects on EJ populations that were \nidentified in the analyses. \n57.  FHWA and the Project Sponsors provided a 44-day public comment period, during \nwhich anyone could submit comments on the Draft EA.  In late August 2022, FHWA and the Project \nSponsors held six virtual public hearings, totaling over 38 hours, to discuss the Draft EA.  This was \nin addition to early outreach conducted while the Draft EA was in development, and special \noutreach to communities and organizations, including multiple meetings to discuss environmental \njustice in relation to the Program.  \n58.  On March 30, 2021, while working with the Project Sponsors, then-Acting FHWA \nAdministrator Stephanie Pollack commended the Program, saying “The FHWA looks forward to \nassisting New York so we can arrive at a prompt and informed NEPA determination on this \nimportant and precedent-setting project.”25  \n \n25 FHWA Greenlights Environmental Assessment for New York City’s Proposed Congestion Pricing Plan, U.S. FED. \nHIGHWAY ADMIN. (March 30, 2021), https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/fhwa-greenlights-environmental-\nassessment-new-york-citys-proposed-congestion-pricing-plan. \n  19   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 20 of 51\n \n59.  Between August 2022 and April 2023, FHWA and the Project Sponsors reviewed \nand  prepared  responses  to  each  of  the  thousands  of  comments  and  prepared  a  Final  EA \nincorporating these responses and changes informed by the public input.   \n60.  The Final EA determined that the Program would not have adverse effects on air \nquality because it would not cause exceedances of health-based National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards.  Nevertheless, the Project Sponsors committed to a robust, $155 million mitigation \npackage over five years to improve air quality and public health in EJ communities with preexisting \npollution and health burdens throughout the region, with particular investments directed to EJ \ncommunities in which the Project could cause any increase in truck traffic.   \n61.  The Final EA further predicted that the Program would meet each of the objectives \ndescribed in Paragraph 54 above based on detailed modeling, using the federally approved Best \nPractices Model maintained by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council. \n62.  The Final EA also predicted many beneficial environmental effects of the Program, \nincluding but not limited to: \na.  reducing emissions of harmful air pollutants including volatile organic compounds, \nnitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, carbon dioxide equivalent \n(i.e., greenhouse gases), and Mobile Source Air Toxics, both within the CBD and \nregion-wide, through an overall reduction in VMT region-wide; \nb.  reducing localized emissions for most EJ communities in the CBD and others \noutside of the CBD;  \nc.  reducing the number of vehicles entering the CBD; \nd.  reducing delays at many intersections and highway segments, thereby improving \ntravel times, reducing vehicle operating costs, and improving safety;  \n  20   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 21 of 51\n \ne.  increasing transit ridership; \nf.  reducing travel times  for bus operations and thereby  facilitating faster, more \nreliable bus trips; \ng.  reducing parking demand within the CBD;  \nh.  reducing regional energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, helping to \nmeet carbon reduction goals;  \ni.  improving air quality and health in EJ communities through implementation of a \n$155 million mitigation program; and  \nj.  creating a dedicated revenue source for investments in public transit, which will \nfurther reduce congestion and improve air quality over time. \n63.  In May 2023, FHWA approved the Final EA.  \n64.  Starting on May 12, FHWA made the Final EA and Draft FONSI available for \npublic review for a period of 30 days, from May 12 to June 12, 2023.   \n65.  On June 22, 2023, FHWA issued a FONSI determining that the Program, including \nmitigation, would not have a significant adverse impact on the environment and would not have a \ndisproportionately high and adverse impact on EJ communities or populations.  \n66.  On June 23, 2023, FHWA’s New York Division Administrator signed the FONSI.  \n67.  On March 27, 2024, the TBTA Board approved a toll rate schedule through a formal \nratemaking process under New York State law.  \n68.  In June 2024, the Project Sponsors, in consultation with FHWA, completed a \nreevaluation under NEPA (“Reevaluation 1”), which assessed the effects of the adopted toll \nstructure.  On June 14, 2024, FHWA concluded that the adopted toll structure and associated \nimpacts were analyzed and mitigated appropriately under NEPA, that no additional environmental \n  21   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 22 of 51\n \nanalysis was warranted, and that the conclusions in the Final EA and FONSI remained valid. \nReevaluation 1 also concluded that the adopted toll structure would meet the congestion-reduction \nand revenue goals for the Program and achieve similar environmental benefits to those described \nin the Final EA. \n69.  In November 2024, the Project Sponsors completed a second reevaluation under \nNEPA (“Reevaluation 2”) to assess a toll structure approach whereby those toll rates would be \nphased in gradually over the first several years of the Program (the “Phase-In Approach”).   \n70.  Reevaluation 2 confirmed that under the Phase-In Approach, the Program would \nstill meet its purpose and need, and all of its objectives.  Reevaluation 2 also confirmed that the \nProject Sponsors would still implement all mitigation commitments, including for EJ communities, \nwithin the same timeframes as contemplated in the Final EA and FONSI.  \n71.  On November 18, 2024, the TBTA Board formally adopted the Phase-In Approach \nto the toll rate schedule under New York State law. \n72.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA approved Reevaluation 2, concluding that the \neffects of the Program were consistent with those disclosed in the EA, that the Phase-In Approach \nof  the  adopted  toll  structure  and  impacts  associated  with  it  were  analyzed  and  mitigated \naccordingly, and that no additional environmental analysis was warranted.   \nD.  The VPPP Agreement Is Executed by FHWA and the Project Sponsors  \n73.  That same day, on November 21, 2024, FHWA and the Project Sponsors signed an \nagreement under the VPPP authorizing the Program’s collection of tolls and requiring (among other \nthings) implementation of the mitigation commitments made in the FONSI.  \n74.  The VPPP Agreement states in relevant part that “[e]ffective on the date of this \nAgreement, the project is approved as a pilot program,” and TBTA is authorized to “operate the \nProgram as a toll Project in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and as a value pricing \n  22   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 23 of 51\n \nproject.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 1, 8.  FHWA further agreed that “the imposition of tolls under this \nAgreement does not render Federal-aid highways within the State of New York generally ineligible \nfor Federal-aid highway funds where such highways are otherwise eligible under the particular \nfunding program.”  Id. cl. 5.   \n75.  In return, the Project Sponsors agreed to a number of obligations in the VPPP \nAgreement, including: (1) “to adequately maintain” federal-aid highways located in the geographic \narea of the Program, id. cl. 6; (2) to submit regular reports on the effects of the Program “on driver \nbehavior, traffic volume, congestion, transit ridership” and other topics to FHWA, id. cl. 8(b); and \n(3) “to comply with all Federal laws and requirements applicable to this project, including the laws \nand policies applicable to the Value Pricing Pilot Program,” id. cl. 9.  Clause 8 of the VPPP \nAgreement further requires that the Project Sponsors “identify benefits the application of tolls has \nin reducing climate pollution” and “demonstrate the benefits mitigation measures provide to \nunderserved communities.”  Id. cl. 8. \n76.  In addition, the VPPP Agreement requires that FHWA and the Project Sponsors \n“will cooperate and work together in the implementation of the Project.”  Id. cl. 8(a). \n77.  The  VPPP  Agreement  does  not  include  any  provision  authorizing  FHWA  to \nterminate the agreement.  Rather, it contemplates that only TBTA could unilaterally decide to \ndiscontinue the Program, requiring the Project Sponsors to “work with FHWA to return the Project \nto its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id. cl. 11 \n(emphasis added).  The VPPP Agreement further provides that TBTA and NYCDOT shall “monitor \nand report on the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the end of the life of \nthe Project, whichever is sooner.”  Id. cl. (8)(b). \n  23   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 24 of 51\n \n78.  The VPPP Agreement references FHWA regulations at 23 C.F.R. Part 940 and 950.  \nThese regulations do not grant FHWA authority to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement. \nE.  The Successful Implementation of the Program \n79.  Prior to implementation of the Program, TBTA budgeted over $500 million towards \nefforts to establish the Program, and much of that budget has already been expended.  These \nexpenditures included developing the methodological approach; conducting the assessment and \nextensive outreach and developing the final documentation for the environmental review process \nunder NEPA; design, development, implementation, and testing of the roadway infrastructure and \nsystem; design, development, implementation, and testing of the Back Office System; additional \nextensive outreach for the State administrative review process; staff costs, including new staff for \nthe Program; and consulting costs.   \n80.  On June 5, 2024, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a temporary pause \nof the Program.  On November 14, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed that the Program move \nforward with the Phase-In Approach, featuring a lower initial toll amount to lessen the burden on \ndrivers.   \n81.  In late 2024, several groups and individuals, as well as the State of New Jersey, \nsought preliminary injunctive relief barring the MTA and TBTA from beginning the Program or \ncollecting tolls on various federal and state constitutional and statutory grounds.  Each of these \nclaims for injunctive relief was rejected by the courts.  See Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. 23 \nCiv. 10365, 2024 WL 5199945 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (Liman, J.)

Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., No. 24 Civ. \n3983 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024 (Seibel, J.), ECF 44.  In rejecting these plaintiffs’ requests for a \npreliminary injunction to halt the Program, courts recognized that the equities and public interest \nfavored  the  Program  moving  forward,  especially  in  light  of  the  expenditures  necessary  to \nimplement the Program and the revenues expected from its operation, see, e.g., Chan, 2024 WL \n5199945, at *48-49; that the implementation of the Program reflected a policy choice by New \nYork’s elected representatives, see id. at *48; and that FHWA conducted a thorough analysis in \ndeciding to allow the Program to proceed, see id. at *5-10; New Jersey v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23 Civ. 3885, ECF 212 at 35. \n82.  One of the plaintiffs that sued to prevent implementation of the Program is the State \nof New Jersey, which sued USDOT and FHWA among others.  On December 30, 2024, Judge Leo \nGordon  granted  USDOT,  FHWA,  MTA,  and  TBTA’s  motions  for  summary  judgment  in \noverwhelming part, rejecting New Jersey’s claims that FHWA acted arbitrarily in assessing the \npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  New  Jersey  resulting  from  air  pollution  and \nidentifying and assessing the potential for disproportionately high and adverse impacts on New \nJersey EJ communities.  New Jersey, No. 23 Civ. 3885 (D.N.J. Jan. 3, 2025), ECF 191.  New \nJersey also raised concerns about the adequacy of participation afforded to New Jersey entities, \nofficials,  and  the  public  throughout  the  process,  and  that  FHWA  had  failed  to  conduct  a \ntransportation conformity analysis under the Clean Air Act for the Project with regard to New \nJersey’s State Implementation Plan, which claims the Court also rejected.  The Court reserved \njudgment on two issues that it remanded to FHWA for further explanation: the amount of place-\n  25   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 26 of 51\n \nbased mitigation funding allocated to New Jersey EJ communities and the consideration of \nalternatives in light of the adopted Phase-In Approach.  Id.  The Court did not, as sought by New \nJersey, vacate the FONSI pending the completion of the remand.  New Jersey subsequently moved \nfor reconsideration and for a temporary restraining order, which the Court denied.  FHWA filed \nits remand results on January 17, 2025, and New Jersey’s response to those results was filed on \nFebruary 7, 2025.  Id., ECF 226. \n83.  On January 5, 2025, the Program went into effect.  Eligible vehicles entering the \nCBD are being tolled at the rates established in the approved toll rate schedule. \n84.  While the Program has only just begun and its full benefits have yet to be realized, \nit is clearly working.  The Financial Times has estimated that “motorists … will save thousands of \nhours per year they currently waste crawling through smoggy tunnels or over clogged bridges.”26  \nMTA hourly traffic data “also showed fewer vehicles in affected tunnels during rush hours.”27  The \nNew York Times reported that officials estimated there were “tens of thousands fewer vehicles \nentering the busiest parts of Manhattan below 60th street” in the first week the Program was in \neffect.28  \n85.

Data collected by the MTA reveals that since the Program began, traffic in the CBD \ndecreased substantially, with 1.2 million fewer vehicles entering the CBD than projected.  Drivers \nin  the  CBD  are  experiencing  travel  time  improvements  in  the  afternoon  peak  hours  “with \nreductions as high as 59%.”31  Inbound river crossings to the CBD have seen a 10%-48% decrease \nin travel times, and several bus routes have seen significant decreases in the time needed to \ncomplete their routes.32  \n87.  At the same time, the fact that there are now fewer cars on the road in the CBD has \nnot stymied economic activity.  In fact, data provided by the MTA shows that in January 2025, \n35.8 million people visited Business Improvement Districts in the CBD, a 1.5 million increase \ncompared to last January.  As one example of businesses in the CBD continuing to thrive, the gross \nrevenue of Broadway shows in January 2025 was 25% higher than January last year and attendance \nat shows was 17% higher.33  This should come as no surprise given business leaders’ support for \nthe Program even before it began.

Emergency vehicle speeds have also improved.  For many years, increasing traffic \nin New York City led to longer and longer emergency vehicle response times.  As documented in \na report issued by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents much of the CBD, and traffic \nengineer Sam Schwartz, over the past decade, “E.M.S. response times to life-threatening situations \nhad increased by 29%; for Fire Department vehicles tending to medical emergencies, the lag was \nup by 72 percent.”37  The preliminary data indicates that emergency vehicles have benefited from \nthe reduction in congestion and are able to respond more quickly to calls.38 \n89.  Reports also indicate that the Program has made the streets safer, with data gathered \nby Streetsblog NYC indicating a striking 51% drop in crash-related injuries in the Program’s first \n12 days as compared to the same time period in 2024.39  Thirty-seven people were injured in 90 \ntotal reported crashes, down from 76 injuries in 199 crashes in the same 12-day period in 2024.  \n90.

And \nmany of New York’s elected representatives also strongly support the Program.

There is evidence that even former skeptics of the Program are coming to see its \nbenefits.  Ali Lyles, who first posted a video on TikTok comparing being charged the toll to “being \nrobbed without a gun,” later posted a video acknowledging that he had saved half an hour on his \ncommute and said, “there wasn’t no traffic, bruh … I might actually like congestion pricing.”51 \nThis is consistent with the experiences of other cities that have implemented congestion pricing \nprograms,  such  as  London  and  Stockholm,  where  support  for  congestion  pricing  increased \nsignificantly following implementation, as the benefits became apparent.52  As the old adage goes, \ntime is money—in this case, collectively tens of billions of dollars that will be saved as a result of \nthe Program, far more than the collective cost to drivers. \nF.

On the day of President Trump’s Inauguration, January 20, 2025, New Jersey \nGovernor Phil Murphy made a personal appeal to him to end the Program.  Governor Murphy noted \nthat President Trump had previously described congestion pricing as a “disaster” and had vowed to \n“TERMINATE” it on his “FIRST WEEK BACK in office!!!”56  \n105.

Similarly, Section 5(f)(iii) of the order requires projects to “mitigate the unique impacts of \nDOT programs,” such as “the accessibility of transportation to families with young children.”  The \nProgram meets these goals by generating revenues to install elevators at subway stations, improve\n56Carl Campanile, NJ Gov.

On February 19, 2025, DOT followed through with the President’s promise to \nattempt to “terminate” congestion pricing by purporting to terminate approval for the VPPP.

This is the definition of arbitrary and capricious—not to mention hypocrisy.

The MTA, TBTA, and the Region’s Economy and Public Transit System Will be \nIrreparably Harmed if Plaintiffs are Forced to End the Program \n109.  TBTA budgeted over $500 million to establish the Program, and much of the \nbudget was expended in advance of implementation.  These expenditures included developing the \nmethodological approach; conducting the assessment and extensive outreach and developing the \nfinal documentation for the environmental review process under NEPA; design, development, \nimplementation  and  testing  of  the  roadway  infrastructure  and  system;  design,  development, \nimplementation and testing of the Back Office System; additional extensive outreach for the State \nadministrative review process; staff costs, including new staff for the Program; and consulting \ncosts.   \n110.  If TBTA is unlawfully prevented from proceeding with the Program, it will incur \nroughly $12 million in additional expenditures per month, most of which would be related to a \ncombination of the operations and maintenance of the roadside tolling system, the operations of \nthe back-office system and Customer Contact Center, and consultant costs.  This figure does not \ninclude the costs related to additional staff that were brought on specifically for the Program nor \nother costs, such as those related to outreach and advertising and assessments to be undertaken for \n  36   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 37 of 51\n \nthe Program.  These costs cannot be deferred pending litigation over the legality of the Challenged \nAction. \n111.  Any pause in the Program would also cause TBTA to lose estimated monthly \nrevenues in the first phase of the Program of over $40 million, based on projected net annual \nrevenues of roughly $500 million during that period. \n112.  Furthermore,  a  pause  in  the  Program  would  result  in  increased  traffic  and \ncongestion, which will lengthen travel times for bus operations and reduce transit ridership. \n113.  Stopping the Program would also prevent MTA, the end recipient of Program \nrevenues, from proceeding with vitally important work under the Capital Program, which is \nintended to ensure that improvements put in place will be sustainable for years to come.  The \nCapital Program identifies $52 billion of critical investments in the region’s subways, buses, and \ncommuter railroads, nearly one-third of which would be supported by the Program.   \n114.  New York’s economy, and therefore the nation’s economy, depends on keeping \nNew York moving.  In practical terms, that means funding the Capital Program, which is much \nneeded and cannot be further delayed.  As Janno Lieber, the MTA CEO, explained: “Concrete and \nsteel, you poke holes in it, subject it to water and chemicals and salt for 100 years, it’s going to \ngive out.”  The reason the State’s elected representatives chose Congestion Pricing was, again, \nbecause it is simply the best solution to promote transportation in the nation (and North America’s) \nlargest transportation system. \n115.  Critical parts of the Capital Program would be delayed if Program tolling revenues \nare halted.  The Capital Program includes: (1) adding accessibility improvements (including \nelevators) to numerous subway stations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, by \nmaking at least 70 more subway systems accessible through building new elevators at 70 stations \n  37   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 38 of 51\n \nin all of the boroughs and replacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators, and finally bring the \ntransportation system to greater than 50% accessibility; (2) improving outdated signaling, by \ndoubling the track lines with modernized signals; (3) purchasing over 1,900 new rail cars, which \nare six times more reliable than older ones, and replacing 2,400 buses; (4) replacing approximately \n60 miles of track; and (5) renewing stations and addressing critical repair projects at 175 stations.  \n116.  The Capital Program will also provide much-needed repairs to Grand Central \nTerminal, a more than 100-year-old structure that is used by more than 700 trains a day.  And \ncoupled with funding from the 2015-2019 program, the Capital Program further provides funding \nfor three new fully accessible stations on the Second Avenue Subway that would allow connection \nto the Metro-North lines, strengthening connections for Harlem and East Harlem residents.  \n117.  New Yorkers, through the Capital Program, will also receive better access to Penn \nStation through a new route with four new stations on the Metro-North New Haven Line that will \ncarry up to 50,000 Metro-North customers directly to Penn Station every day.  \n118.  TBTA has incurred debt that it will rely on Program revenues to repay.  This \nincludes $378.8 million in short-term notes that were previously issued and currently outstanding \nto fund infrastructure costs and $500 million in short-term notes to fund a portion of the $15 billion \nof capital projects in the MTA’s Capital Program. \n119.  Finally,  ending  the  Program  means  the  unabated  continuation  of  the  severe \ncongestion in the CBD, with its concomitant economic, environmental, and public health and \nsafety costs to businesses, residents, commuters, workers, and visitors in this area, without any \nevaluation of these and other environmental impacts, opportunity for public participation, or \nconsideration of alternatives required by NEPA.   \n  38   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 39 of 51\n \n120.  Plaintiffs will continue to operate the Program as required by New York law until \nand unless Plaintiffs are directed to stop by a court order.   \n121.

The acts of all executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, and in case \nan official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have jurisdiction to \ngrant relief.”  Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 108 (1902).  \n124.  Further, under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity,” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(B)-(C).  \n125.  Defendants  are  not  authorized  by  any  law—statutory  or  constitutional—to \nunilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement contrary to its terms.  The VPPP Agreement is a valid \nagreement, currently in effect, supported by consideration, and subject to considerable reliance \ninterests.  Neither ISTEA nor the VPPP Agreement authorizes FHWA to unilaterally rescind the \nVPPP Agreement or to rescind FHWA’s approval of the Program.   \n  39   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 40 of 51\n \n126.  ISTEA does not include any provision authorizing FHWA to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement.  ISTEA authorizes the Secretary to “enter into” agreements “to establish, maintain, and \nmonitor” value pricing pilot programs. ISTEA § 1012(b).  ISTEA further directs that the Secretary \nshall “monitor the effect of such programs for a period of at least 10 years.”  \n127.  The  VPPP  Agreement  does  not  include  any  provision  authorizing  FHWA  to \nterminate the agreement.  Rather, the VPPP Agreement contemplates that only TBTA could \nunilaterally decide to discontinue the Program, requiring the Project Sponsors to “work with FHWA \nto return the Project to its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the \nProject.”  VPPP Agmt. cl. 11.  The VPPP Agreement further provides that TBTA and NYCDOT \nshall “monitor and report on the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the \nend of the life of the Project, whichever is sooner.”  Id. cl. (8)(b). \n128.  The VPPP Agreement references FHWA regulations at 23 C.F.R. Part 940 and 950.  \nThese regulations do not purport to grant FHWA authority to unilaterally terminate the VPPP \nAgreement, and the FHWA has acted ultra vires. \n129.  In addition, an executive officer acts ultra vires where it “deprives a contractor of \na right expressly or impliedly granted by another statute.”  Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 \nF.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n130.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of rights expressly and impliedly granted by \nISTEA § 1012(b), which permits tolling of federally funded highways following approval of a \nVPPP Project.  \n131.  Defendants have no authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement or rescind TBTA’s \nauthority to operate the Program.  Therefore, Defendants have acted contrary to law and the \nChallenged Action is arbitrary and capricious and must be declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside.  \n  40   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 41 of 51\n \nCOUNT II \nUltra Vires  \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \n132.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.  \n133.  The acts of all executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, and in case \nan official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have jurisdiction to \ngrant relief.” Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 108 (1902).  \n134.  ISTEA  does  not  authorize  Defendants  to  unilaterally  rescind  a  cooperative \nagreement entered into to authorize tolling under the VPPP, nor does the VPPP Agreement itself \nempower Defendants to terminate the agreement or rescind FHWA’s approval of the Program.  \n135.  The Challenged Action is ultra vires because it purports to unilaterally terminate \nthe VPPP Agreement and rescind TBTA’s authority to implement tolls under the VPPP for the \nProgram without statutory authority and contrary to the applicable agency regulations and the terms \nof the VPPP Agreement.  \n136.  The Challenged Action is ultra vires because rescission of the VPPP Agreement is \nnot authorized under any provision of law.  \n137.  The Challenged Action is ultra vires because the VPPP Agreement is a valid and \nbinding agreement and the VPPP Agreement does not permit unilateral rescission by FHWA or any \nother governmental actor. \n138.  In addition, an executive officer also acts ultra vires where it “deprives a contractor \nof a right expressly or impliedly granted by another statute.”  Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 \nF.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n139.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of rights expressly and impliedly granted by \nISTEA §1012(b), and thus acted ultra vires.  \n  41   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 42 of 51\n \nCOUNT III \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Procedurally Arbitrary & Capricious – Contrary to Regulations) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n140.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n141.  The VPPP Agreement is a cooperative agreement because “the principal purpose \nof the relationship is to transfer a thing of value” (authority to collect toll revenues) and “substantial \n[federal] involvement is expected.”  31 U.S.C. § 6305; 2 C.F.R. 200.1; see also 23 U.S.C. § 149 \nnote  (Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program),  cl.  1  (authorizing  Secretary  to  enter  into  “cooperative \nagreements” under the VPPP).  FHWA has determined that agreements authorizing projects that \nrequire tolling authority under the VPPP are cooperative agreements, even where such agreements \ndo not include a federal funding component.  See Congestion Pricing, Value Pricing Pilot Program, \nFHWA (May 17, 2024), https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing (“The Moving \nAhead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act did not authorize additional funds after \nFY2012 for the discretionary grant  component of the Value Pricing  Pilot Program (VPPP).  \nHowever, FHWA’s ability to enter into cooperative agreements for projects that require tolling \nauthority under this program for their implementation will continue.”) (last accessed Feb. 12, 2025). \n142.  FHWA has adopted the Office of Management and Budget’s agency-wide Uniform \nAdministrative  Requirements,  Cost  Principles,  and  Audit  Requirements  for  Federal \nAwards (“Uniform Guidance”), 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  See id. § 1201.1. \n143.  The  Uniform  Guidance  sets  out  specific  conditions  under  which  an  award, \nincluding a cooperative agreement, see id. § 200.1, may be terminated:  \n  42   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 43 of 51\n \na.  by the agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms and conditions” \nof the award;  \nb.  by the agency with the “consent” of the recipient;  \nc.  by the recipient; and \nd.  by the agency “pursuant to the terms and conditions” of the award.   \nId. § 200.340(a).   \n \n144.  None of the conditions in which termination is permitted under the Uniform \nGuidance are present here.  First, Defendant Duffy did not and cannot claim that the recipients have \nfailed to comply with the terms of the conditions of the VPPP Agreement, and the recipients have \nin fact complied with the terms of the VPPP Agreement; second, the recipients did not and do not \nconsent to termination of the VPPP Agreement; third, the recipients have not requested termination \nof the VPPP Agreement; and, fourth, the VPPP Agreement does not contain any provisions that \nwould permit Defendants to terminate the agreement unilaterally.  Additionally, to the extent the \nVPPP Agreement contemplates termination by any party, it reflects that TBTA would be the one \nparty which could “discontinue tolls on the Project.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 11. \n145.  The Uniform Guidance describes specific steps that an agency must take before it \nmay terminate an award for noncompliance, including providing written notice and an opportunity \nto be heard.  2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a), 342; see also U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Guide to Financial \nAssistance at 72-77 (Oct. 2019) (further describing requirements for pre-termination notice and \nappeals).  FHWA did not provide the recipients with notice of its intent to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement and also has not provided notice to the recipients of any alleged noncompliance with \nthe VPPP Agreement.  The recipients have not been provided with an opportunity to be heard or to \nappeal the termination. \n  43   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 44 of 51\n \n146.  The  Administration’s  action  in  terminating  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement  contrary to  the terms of the VPPP Agreement and to the applicable regulations \ngoverning  the  administration  of  the  VPPP  Agreement  was  arbitrary,  capricious,  and  not  in \naccordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, within the meaning of \nthe APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by the Court. \nCOUNT IV \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment  \n(U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 3) \n147.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n148.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “No person shall … \nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend. V, cl. 3. \n149.  Upon the execution of the VPPP Agreement, Plaintiffs had a property interest in \nthe VPPP Agreement and in the authority granted by the VPPP Agreement to implement tolls within \nthe CBD for the Program.  \n150.  An agency’s withdrawal of consent for public or private entities to engage in a \ncontract implicates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Toxco Inc. \nv. Chu, 724 F. Supp. 2d 16, 27-28 (D.D.C. 2010).  Defendants’ unilateral termination of the VPPP \nAgreement deprives Plaintiffs of a property interest contrary to law. \n151.  Further, the Plaintiffs’ property interest in the Program and its infrastructure “attain \n... constitutional status by virtue of the fact that they have been initially recognized and protected \nby state law,” here, the TMA.  Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign Inv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 315 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976)).  \n  44   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 45 of 51\n \n152.  Unilateral termination of the VPPP Agreement does not afford Plaintiffs the process \nthey are entitled to under the VPPP Agreement, the relevant regulations, and the United States \nConstitution.  Prior to terminating the VPPP Agreement, Defendants did not provide Plaintiffs with \nnotice and failed to give Plaintiffs an opportunity to respond or be heard. \n153.  In  addition,  the  VPPP  Agreement  constitutes  an  agreement  which  cannot  be \ninvalidated without due process in accordance with its terms.   \n154.  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  Fifth  Amendment  by \ndepriving Plaintiffs without due process of their property interest in the VPPP Agreement and the \nauthority granted by the VPPP Agreement to implement tolls within the CBD for the Program.  \nCOUNT V \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Substantively Arbitrary & Capricious – Insufficient Explanation) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.)  \n \n155.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n156.  At the time of Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, FHWA \nhad issued the Final EA, FONSI, Reevaluation 1, and Reevaluation 2, and had executed the VPPP \nAgreement authorizing tolling under the Program.   \n157.  FHWA’s execution of the VPPP Agreement constituted final agency action with \nrespect to FHWA’s decision to authorize tolling under the Program. \n158.  Under the APA, an agency “changing its course” by rescinding a prior rule or order \n“is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when \nan agency does not act in the first instance.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983).  \n  45   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 46 of 51\n \n159.  Defendants did not adequately explain their reasoning for purportedly rescinding \nthe VPPP Agreement, in violation of the APA.  See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, \n106 (2015) (“[T]he APA requires an agency to provide more substantial justification when its new \npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its \nprior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”) \n160.  Defendants did not adequately examine or rely on relevant data in deciding to \nterminate the VPPP Agreement, in violation of the APA.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., 463 \nU.S. at 30 (an agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for \nits action.”) \n161.  Defendants failed to consider the impact on the economy, the environment, and \ncongestion in the CBD in acting to terminate the tolling authority for the Program.  The Program \nwill provide substantial benefits to the CBD and the region in terms of reduced traffic and \ncongestion, improved air quality, and concomitant environmental, public health, and economic \nbenefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that occurred following the implementation of the \nProgram.   \n162.  Defendants were obligated to consider the costs of ending the VPPP Agreement for \ntransit riders, people residing, working, learning and recreating in and around the CBD, and TBTA \nand MTA.  Defendants  transparently failed to do so, having made their decision without seeking \ninput from Plaintiffs and without inquiring about the costs from congestion, pollution, and cessation \nof a program the TBTA has invested hundreds of millions to bring online.   \n163.  Defendants also failed to adequately  consider  whether  “there was  ‘legitimate \nreliance’ on the” prior administration’s method of using the VPPP Agreement as an indispensable \ntool in efforts to address congestion, reduce pollution, and raise revenues to support public transit.  \n  46   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 47 of 51\n \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Ca., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020) (quoting Smiley \nv. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996)).  The MTA, TBTA, and now holders \nof debt issued in reliance on Program revenues, have all relied on the executed VPPP Agreement.  \nThe Challenged Action was arbitrary and capricious; where, as here, “an agency changes course ... \nit must ‘be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that \nmust be taken into account.”’ Id. (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, \n2126 (2016)).   \n164.  In addition, Defendants failed to consider alternative approaches that would allow \nat least some of the Program to continue, or another means to raise revenues, and that would have \naccordingly imposed less-significant burdens on Plaintiffs.  The Supreme Court has held an agency \naction is arbitrary and capricious because it was issued “‘without any consideration whatsoever’ of \na [more limited] policy.”  Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. at 1912 (quoting State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 51).  \n165.  By omitting any analysis of continuing at least some elements of the Program, the \nChallenged Action “failed to consider important aspects of the problem” before it. Id. at 1910. \n166.  The Challenged Action, likewise, fails to meaningfully consider more limited \npolicies than complete termination of VPPP Agreement. \n167.  Instead, Defendants acted entirely based on political considerations.  Defendants \nhad made no indication that it was reconsidering the Program until President Trump took office last \nmonth.  But President Trump has long indicated his desire to “kill” or terminate the Program, both \nin conversations with Republican lawmakers and in social media posts.  Defendants, bending under \nthis political pressure, did not undertake any analysis or provide any explanation before revoking \nits prior decision to enter into the VPPP Agreement and approve the Program. \n  47   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 48 of 51\n \n168.  Defendants’  action  purporting  to  revoke  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement  without  providing  sufficient  explanation  of  its  decision  was  therefore  arbitrary, \ncapricious, and not in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, \nwithin the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by \nthe Court. \nCOUNT VI \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act \n(42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.; 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706) \n169.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n170.  At  the  time  of  Defendants’  purported  termination  of  the  VPPP  Agreement, \nDefendants had issued the Final EA, FONSI, Reevaluation 1, and Reevaluation 2, and had executed \nthe VPPP Agreement authorizing tolling under the Program.   \n171.  At the time of Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, the \nNEPA process for the Program was complete, and there was no “major federal action” remaining \nto occur with respect to the Program.   \n172.  Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement constitutes a new final \nagency action under NEPA and the APA and a major federal action within the meaning of NEPA, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 4332(C), 4336e(10). \n173.  NEPA requires Defendants to prepare an EIS for any “major federal action[] \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).   \n174.  To determine whether a “major federal action” will have a significant effect on “the \nquality of the human environment,” Defendants may prepare an EA.  42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 40 \nC.F.R. § 1501.5; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119.   \n  48   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 49 of 51\n \n175.  If an agency determines that the proposed action will not have significant effects, \naccounting for mitigation, it can issue a FONSI. 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 40 C.F.R. § 1501.6; 23 \nC.F.R. § 771.121.  If the EA reveals that there may be significant effects, an EIS is required.   \n176.  Either level of review requires public participation opportunities and consideration \nof alternatives to the proposed action.  E.g., 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii), (F) and (H); 40 C.F.R. \n§§ 1501.5(c), (f), 1502.14s; 23 C.F.R. 771.119(b).  \n177.  Defendants failed to undertake any NEPA review of their decision to terminate the \nVPPP Agreement, much less an adequate environmental review that considered all environmental \nimpacts of the proposed action.   \n178.  Defendants did not undertake any public participation with respect to their decision \nto terminate the VPPP Agreement, in contrast to the substantial public participation opportunities \nafforded prior to the adoption of the Final EA (including 44-day public comment period) and \nFONSI (including a 30-day public availability period).   \n179.  Under NEPA and its implementing regulations, Defendants are required to take a \nhard look at the reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental impacts of a proposed \naction and its alternatives.  42 U.S.C. § 4336; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b).   \n180.  Defendants failed to consider the full extent of the reasonably foreseeable impacts \nof seeking to terminate the Program, which will provide substantial benefits to the CBD and the \nregion  in  terms  of  reduced  traffic  and  congestion,  improved  air  quality,  and  concomitant \nenvironmental, public health, and economic benefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that \noccurred following the implementation of the Program.   \n181.  Defendants failed to consider alternatives to terminating the program. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4332(C)(iii), (F) and (H); 40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.5(c), 1502.14s; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b). \n  49   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413     Document 1     Filed 02/19/25     Page 50 of 51\n \n182.  Defendants  failed  to  consider  mitigation  measures  that  “avoid,  minimize,  or \ncompensate for adverse effects caused by a proposed action or alternatives,” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.1(y), \nor to identify measures which might mitigate adverse environmental impacts, and incorporate \nmeasures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts into its action terminating the VPPP Agreement. \n23 C.F.R. §§ 771.105(e), 771.119(b).   \n183.  Defendants’  action  in  revoking  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP  Agreement \nwithout conducting the required NEPA review was therefore arbitrary, capricious, and not in \naccordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, within the meaning of \nthe APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by the Court. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:  \ni.  Declare that Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement \nwas undertaken in violation of the terms of the VPPP Agreement and is in \nexcess of statutory authority and ultra vires; in violation of Plaintiffs’ Fifth \nAmendment  right  to  Due  Process;  without  observance  of  procedure \nrequired  by  law  in  violation  of  the  APA;  arbitrary  and  capricious  in \nviolation of the APA; and violates NEPA; \nii.  Vacate the Challenged Action and Defendants’ decision to purportedly \nterminate the VPPP Agreement; \niii.  Grant any further necessary and proper relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202; \niv.

The New York State Department of \nTransportation (“State DOT”) respectfully moves to intervene as plaintiff in this \naction.   \nState DOT seeks to intervene because the purported termination by USDOT, \nif  upheld  by  this  Court,  would  constitute  a  direct  infringement  of  State  DOT’s \nauthority to implement the Traffic Mobility Act (the “Act”), the state statute that \nauthorized the congestion pricing program, and to maintain the benefits of congestion \npricing for New Yorkers.  The congestion pricing program is already furthering the \ngoals set out in the Act by providing significant reductions in traffic congestion and \nrevenue for public transit improvements.   \nState DOT qualifies for intervention as of right under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24(a)(2) because (1) its motion is timely; (2) it has an interest relating to \nthe subject of the action, namely, the continued implementation of congestion pricing \npursuant to state law; (3) the disposition of the action without its intervention may, \nas a practical matter, impair or impede its ability to protect its interest; and (4) its \nsovereign and quasi-sovereign interests are not adequately represented by the other \nparties.    State  DOT  also  qualifies  for  intervention  by  permission  under  Rule \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 7 of 20\n24(b)(1)(B) because its legal claims share common questions of law or fact with the \nMTA’s claims.   \nState DOT therefore requests that the Court enter an order authorizing it to \nintervene,  in  which  event  State  DOT  would  file  the  proposed  complaint-in-\nintervention  attached  as  Exhibit  A  to  the  Notice  of  Motion  (“Complaint-in-\nIntervention”).  Counsel for the MTA has stated that it does not oppose State DOT’s \nintervention. Counsel for USDOT has stated that it cannot take a position before \nseeing these motion papers.   \nBACKGROUND \n \nA.  New York State’s Congestion Pricing Statute \nIn 2019, the New York legislature enacted the Act.  N.Y. Vehicle & Traffic L. \n§§ 1701-1706.  Two goals of the Act were to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution \ncaused by traffic congestion in an area designated as the “central business district,” \nwhich includes all roads in Manhattan south of 60th Street with a few exceptions.  Id. \n§§ 1701, 1704(2).  A third goal was to create a dedicated funding source for the capital \nneeds of the MTA, which operates the New York City region’s subway, bus, and \ncommuter railroads, in addition to numerous bridges and tunnels.  Id. § 1701.  To \nachieve  these  ends,  the  Act  directed  Triborough,  an  affiliate  agency  of  the \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority, to establish and charge tolls for vehicles \nentering Manhattan’s central business district for the purpose of reducing traffic and \nenvironmental harms in the central business district, as well as paying the operating \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 8 of 20\ncosts  of  the  congestion  pricing  program  and  funding  MTA  capital  improvement \nprojects.  Id. § 1704-a.  \nB.  Implementation of the Act and Commencement  \nof Congestion Tolling \nBecause there are numerous highways in the central business district that are \neligible to receive federal aid, the federal government took the position that the MTA \nneeded to obtain federal permission to implement the tolls required by the Traffic \nMobility Act.  The Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”) provides such federal \nauthority through the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”), which was established \nby the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (“ISTEA”) Pub. L. \n102-240 (Dec. 18, 1991), § 1012(b); 23 U.S.C. § 149 note. To participate in the VPPP, \nStates, local governments, and public authorities enter into “cooperative agreements” \nwith FHWA.  Id. § 1012(b)(1); 23 U.S.C. § 149 note. \nThe FHWA has consistently determined that the VPPP allows “cordon pricing,” \nwhich imposes tolls to drive into a congested area.1  Revenues generated by a VPPP \n \n1  See FHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program Through April 2006 at 10 \n(undated), https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/ \nrpttocongress/pdf/vppp06rpt.pdf; FHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program \nThrough May 2009 at 3 (Sept. 17, 2009), https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/ \ncongestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp09rpt.pdf; \nFHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program Through April 2010 at 2 (May \n2010), https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/ \nrpttocongress/pdf/vppp10rpt.pdf; FHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program \nThrough April 2012 at 11, 50 (May 2012), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/\npdf/vppp12rpt.pdf; FHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program Through \nApril 2016 at iii, 31 (undated), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/\npdf/vppp16rpt.pdf; FHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program Through \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 9 of 20\nproject must be used for any “projects eligible under [Title 23].”  ISTEA § 1012(b)(3), \n23 U.S.C. § 149 note. Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. § 133(b)(1)(C), eligible projects include \npublic transportation projects under 49 U.S.C. §§ 5307(a)(1) and 5337(b)(1).   \nIn June 2019, NYSDOT, an authorized participant in the VPPP, requested that \nthe FHWA enter into an agreement with Triborough, NYSDOT, and the New York \nCity  Department  of  Transportation  (together,  “project  sponsors”),  to  obtain \ncongestion  tolling  authority  through  the  VPPP.    Complaint-in-Intervention, \nExhibit 4.  As required by the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4321-4370m-11, the FHWA reviewed the potential environmental impacts of New \nYork’s  congestion  pricing  program.    In  April  2023,  the  FHWA  issued  an \n“environmental assessment,” and in June 2023 it issued a “finding of no significant \nimpact.”  See, e.g., 88 Fed. Reg. 41998, 41998 (June 28, 2023).   \nIn March 2024, Triborough adopted a toll rate schedule.

Letter from \nRichard Marquis to Allison de Cerreño (June 14, 2024).3   \nIn November 2024, Governor Hochul announced and the MTA subsequently \nadopted a revised toll rate schedule that phased in the initial toll schedule over the \nfirst several years of the program.  See, e.g., Letter from Roberta Kaplan to the Hon. \nLewis Liman (Nov. 14, 2024) [Chan ECF No. 125].  After the preparation of a second \nreevaluation, the FHWA confirmed that the phased-in tolling schedule would have \nno significant environmental impacts.  Letter from Richard Marquis to Allison de \nCerreño (Nov. 21, 2024).4  In late November, the FHWA approved the use of tolling \nunder the congestion pricing program by entering into a cooperative agreement \npursuant to the VPPP with State DOT and the other project sponsors.  Complaint-in-\nIntervention, Exhibit 2.   \nOn January 5, 2025, congestion pricing began.  Since then, data have shown \nsignificant positive results:  an average of 60,000 fewer cars per day have been \nentering the district; bridge and tunnel travel times into the district during the \nmorning rush hour have decreased by nine percent to 44 percent; January retail sales \nin the district increased by more than $900,000,000 as compared to January of last \nyear; and attendance at Broadway shows in January and early February increased \n \n3  https://new.mta.info/document/142701.  \n4  https://new.mta.info/document/158196.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 11 of 20\nby 21 percent as compared to the comparable period last year.  MTA, MTA Board \nMeeting February 26, 2025, at 8-10 (Feb. 26, 2025).5 \nC.  The Purported Termination of the Cooperative  \nAgreement \nOn  February 19, 2025,  Secretary  Duffy sent  a  letter  to  Governor  Hochul \nadvising her that he was terminating the cooperative agreement because, in his view, \nthe FHWA had lacked authority to enter into it under the VPPP and because of \nPresident  Trump’s  political  opposition  to  congestion  pricing.    Complaint-in-\nIntervention, Exhibit 1.  Soon after, President Trump announced “CONGESTION \nPRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE \nKING.” The following day, FHWA Executive Director Shepherd sent a follow-up letter \ndirecting the project sponsors to coordinate with the FHWA to cease collection of \ncongestion pricing tolls by March 31, 2025.  Complaint-in-Intervention, Exhibit 3. \nD.  This Litigation \nOn February 19, 2025, MTA filed its complaint [ECF No. 1] against USDOT, \nthe FHWA, Secretary Duffy, and Executive Director Shepherd (“Defendants”).  MTA \nclaims that the termination of the cooperative agreement violated the Administrative \nProcedure Act because the USDOT did not have legal authority to terminate the \nagreement, violated regulations governing contract termination, and failed to provide \nan adequate explanation for the termination; violated the due process clause; and \nfailed to comply with NEPA before the termination.  Complaint ¶¶ 122-131, 140-183.  \nThe MTA also claims that the termination is ultra vires.  Id. ¶¶ 132-139.  As relief, \n \n5  https://www.mta.info/document/165401.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 12 of 20\nthe complaint seeks a declaration that the purported termination is unlawful and \nvacatur of that termination.  Id. at 50.   \nDefendants have not yet answered or otherwise responded to the complaint.  \nTwo non-governmental groups, the Riders Alliance and Sierra Club, have moved to \nintervene [ECF No. 23].   \nE.  State DOT’s Proposed Complaint-in-Intervention \nState DOT’s proposed Complaint-in-Intervention, filed as an exhibit to its \nNotice of Motion, claims that the USDOT’s purported termination of the cooperative \nagreement violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the USDOT lacked \nauthority to terminate (first claim, ¶¶ 105-112), did not provide State DOT notice and \nan  opportunity  to  be  heard  before  the  termination  (third  claim,  ¶¶ 118-123), \narbitrarily and capriciously contended that FHWA did not have authority to sign the \nagreement and failed to explain FHWA’s reversal in position (fourth claim, ¶¶ 124-\n135), and did not conduct an environmental review under NEPA (fifth claim, ¶¶ 136-\n150).  State DOT also claims that the termination was ultra vires (second claim, ¶¶ \n113-117).  \nARGUMENT \n \nTHE COURT SHOULD GRANT STATE DOT \nLEAVE TO INTERVENE. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 allows a non-party to intervene in ongoing \nlitigation in two ways: as of right or by permission of the court.  On motions to \nintervene, courts accept as true the applicant's non-conclusory allegations.  See, e.g., \nAristocrat Leisure Ltd. v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas, 262 F.R.D. 348, 352 \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 13 of 20\n(S.D.N.Y. 2009).  State DOT meets the requirements for both intervention as of right \nunder Rule 24(a)(2) and for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1)(B). \nI.  State DOT Is Entitled to Intervention as of Right Under Rule 24(a). \n \nCourts grant intervention as of right under Rule 24(a)(2) when an applicant \ndemonstrates that: (1) its motion is timely; (2) it has an interest relating to the \nproperty or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) without intervention the \ndisposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede its ability to \nprotect its interest; and (4) its interest is not adequately represented by the other \nparties.  See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of Wis. v. N.Y., 732 F.2d 261, 265 (2d Cir. \n1984) (citations omitted).  State DOT meets all of these requirements. \nA.  This Motion to Intervene Is Timely. \nUnder  Rule 24(a)(2),  the  threshold inquiry  is  whether  the  application  for \nintervention is timely.  Among the factors courts consider in evaluating timeliness \nare: “(1) how long the applicant had notice of the interest before it made the motion \nto intervene; (2) prejudice to existing parties resulting from any delay; (3) prejudice \nto the applicant if the motion is denied; and (4) any unusual circumstances militating \nfor or against a finding of timeliness.”  Olin Corp. v. Lamorak Ins. Co., 325 F.R.D. 85, \n87 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting United States v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., 25 F.3d 66, 70 (2d Cir. \n1994)).   \nAll of these considerations establish timeliness here.  State DOT is making this \nmotion within 28 days of MTA’s filing of the complaint.  At this early point, defendants \nhave not answered the complaint, the Court has not ruled on any issue in this \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 14 of 20\nlitigation  other  than  related  case  status,  discovery  has  not  commenced,  and  no \nmotions or other applications for relief are pending before the Court other than this \nintervention motion and one other such motion.  See, e.g., Akiachak Native Cmty. v. \nDep’t of the Interior, 584 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5-6 (D.D.C. 2008); Citizens for an Orderly \nEnergy Pol’y, Inc. v. Cnty. of Suffolk, 101 F.R.D. 497, 501 (E.D.N.Y. 1984).  No unusual \ncircumstances counseling against intervention are present.  There is accordingly no \nprejudice to the parties to this litigation.   \nB.  State DOT Has Significant Protectable Interests Relating to \nThis Action. \nTo intervene as of right, the applicant must have an interest relating to the \nproperty or transaction that is “direct, substantial, and legally protectable.”  Peterson \nv. Islamic Republic of Iran, 290 F.R.D. 54, 59 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citations omitted).  This \ninterest  requirement  “is  primarily  a  practical  guide  to  disposing  of  lawsuits  by \ninvolving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and \ndue process.”  Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 700 (D.C. Cir. 1967).   \n State DOT has both sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests here.  First, State \nDOT has a direct interest in ensuring that the cooperative agreement authorizing \ncongestion pricing to which NYSDOT, as an authorized participant in the VPPP was \na signatory, remains in effect.   \nSecond, State DOT, as the executive agency tasked “with overall responsibility \nfor  balanced  transportation  policy  and  planning,”  has  a  sovereign  interest  in \nimplementing the Act, which reflects the considered policy judgment of the State’s \nelected officials.  See New York Transportation Law § 10; Alfred L. Snapp & Son v. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 15 of 20\nPuerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982) (a State’s sovereign interests include “the power \nto create and enforce a legal code”); AB ex rel. CD v. Rhinebeck Central Sch. Dist., 224 \nF.R.D. 144, 157 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (agency’s interest in ensuring proper enforcement of \nlaw met interest requirement).   \nThird, State DOT has quasi-sovereign or parens patriae interests in defending \ncongestion pricing against attempts to terminate it because it is part of the State’s \nmission to protect the health and welfare of its residents:  the congestion pricing \nprogram  reduces  the  economic  and  environmental  harms  that  traffic  congestion \nimposes  on  the  State’s  residents  and  improves  public  transit  used  each  day by \nmillions those people to travel to work and elsewhere.  See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, \n458 U.S. at 602 (a State has quasi-sovereign interests “[i]n the well-being of its \npopulace”); Md. People’s Counsel v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Com., 760 F.2d 318, 321 \n(1985) (allowing a state agency to invoke a State’s parens patriae interests); United \nStates v. Hooker Chemicals & Plastics Corp., 101 F.R.D. 444, 447 (W.D.N.Y. 1984) \n(Canadian  province’s  interest  in  protecting  health  of  its  residents  met  interest \nrequirement).   \nC.  This Action May Impair the Interests of State DOT. \nState DOT meets the third element of the test for intervention as of right \nbecause the outcome of this action “may as a practical matter impair or impede [its] \nability to protect its interest.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).  A ruling upholding the \npurported  termination  of  the  cooperative  agreement  would  impair  State  DOT’s \ninterests as discussed above: preservation of an agreement to which State DOT is a \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 16 of 20\nparty, implementation of a state statute, and protection of New Yorkers’ health and \nwelfare.  \nD.  State DOT’s Interests Are Not Adequately Represented by  \nthe Current Parties. \nAs to the fourth prong for intervention as of right, inadequacy of representation \nby other parties, the burden on a proposed intervenor “should be treated as minimal,” \nrequiring only that the movant “show[ ] that representation of his interest may be \ninadequate.”  Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972) \n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re New York City \nPolicing During Summer 2020 Demonstrations, 27 F.4th 792, 803 (2d Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Trbovich); N.Y. Pub. Int. Rrch. Grp., Inc. v. Regents of the University of the \nState of N.Y., 516 F.2d 350, 352 (2d Cir. 1975) (inadequate representation when \nintervenor’s arguments would likely have different emphasis); WildEarth Guardians \nv. Jewell, 320 F.R.D. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2017) (inadequate representation because states \n“may  have  unique  sovereign  interests  not  shared  by  the  federal  government”); \nAkiachak Native Cmty., 584 F. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2008) (same); United States v. \nHooker  Chemicals  &  Plastics  Corp.,  101  F.R.D.  444,  448-449  (W.D.N.Y.  1984)  \n(inadequate representation when plaintiffs and intervenors shared similar goals but \nthere was “the likelihood” that plaintiffs and intervenors would “place different \nemphasis upon different problems”). Thus, for example, when an indigenous nation \nsued the Department of Interior to challenge a prohibition on the Department’s \nplacement of land in Alaska into trust for indigenous nations, the State of Alaska was \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 17 of 20\nallowed to intervene as of right because the Department had “no clear interest in \nprotecting  Alaska’s  sovereignty  or  Alaska’s  interest  as  a  party  to  [a  settlement \nagreement].”  Akiachak Native Cmty., 584 F. Supp. at 7. \nAlthough  both  the  MTA  and  State  DOT  share  an  interest  in  reducing \ncongestion and funding public transit improvements, only State DOT has sovereign \ninterests in ensuring compliance with its state law and quasi-interests in protecting \nthe public health and welfare of New Yorkers.  See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, 458 U.S. \nat 601-602. Because State DOT has those distinct interests, it is likely, as in Hooker \nChemicals, 101 F.R.D. at 448-49, that State DOT will “place different emphasis upon \ndifferent problems” than the MTA does and therefore State DOT’s interests are not \nadequately represented by the MTA. \nAccordingly, State DOT should be allowed to intervene as of right. \nII.  State DOT Should Be Granted Permissive Intervention Under \nRule 24(b) \n \nRule 24(b)(1) provides that, “[o]n timely motion, the court may permit anyone \nto intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a \ncommon question of law or fact” after consideration of “whether the intervention will \nunduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.”  Courts \nconstrue Rule 24(b)(1) liberally and have granted intervention even when a “single \ncommon question of law or fact is involved, despite factual differences between the \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 18 of 20\nparties.”  McNeill v. N.Y.C. Housing Auth., 719 F. Supp. 233, 250 (S.D.N.Y. 1989).6  \nAnd “[t]he words claim or defense are not to be read in a technical sense, but only \nrequire some interest on the part of the applicant.”  Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nJust., 161 F.R.D. 247, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).  In particular, permissive intervention “is \nappropriate where the applicant’s interest will be finally determined by the suit.”  Id.   \nA district court has broad discretion to grant or deny a request for permissive \nintervention “to determine the fairest and most efficient method of handling a case \nwith multiple parties and claims.”  Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Everest Mgmt. Corp., 475 \nF.2d 1236, 1240 (2d Cir. 1972); see also Sw. Payroll Serv., Inc. v. Pioneer Bancorp, \nInc., No. 1:19-CV-01349 (FJS/CFH), 2020 WL 12675945, at *8 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2020) \n(recommending permissive intervention to avoid “piecemeal litigation”), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2021 WL 4583643 (N.D.N.Y. Oct 6, 2021); Dixon v. Scott \nFetzer Co, No. 3:11-cv-982 (MPS), 2016 WL 10514834, at *2 (D. Conn. May 31, 2016) \n(granting permissive intervention to allow quicker resolution of plaintiff-intervenors’ \nclaims).  Courts may also consider the factors relevant on a motion for Rule 24(a) \nintervention  as  of  right  when  addressing  a  motion  for  Rule  24(b)  permissive \nintervention.  See, e.g., Olin Corp. v. Lamorak Ins. Co., 325 F.R.D. 85, 87 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018).   \n \n6  Before the amendments to Rule 24 effective in December 2007, Rule 24(b)(1)(B)’s \nprovision regarding shared questions of law or fact was codified as Rule 24(b)(2).  \nAlthough the wording changed slightly, those 2007 changes were intended to be \nstylistic only, not substantive.  Advisory Committee Notes to the 2007 Amendment.  \nAccordingly, decisions under Rule 24(b)(2) issued before December 2007, like McNeill, \nare valid precedent for current Rule 24(b)(1)(B). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 19 of 20\nState  DOT  meets  the  standards  for  permissive  intervention.    First,  as \nexplained above (at 8-9), this motion for intervention is timely, see, e.g., Blatch v. \nFranco, No. 97-civ-3918 (DC), 1998 WL 265132, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 1998) (finding \ntimeliness when litigation was “still in its early stages”), and will not delay this \nlitigation or prejudice the original parties’ rights. \nSecond, the MTA’s claims and State DOT’s claims are closely related in that \nthey share the most central question of law and fact:  whether the USDOT’s attempt \nto  terminate  the  congestion  pricing  program  by  terminating  the  cooperative \nagreement is lawful.  See, e.g., In re Snap Inc. Sec. Litig., 334 F.R.D. 209, 215 (C.D. \nCal. 2019) (intervention granted when intervenors’ claims arose out of same alleged \nacts as plaintiffs’ claims).  Both the MTA and State DOT seek declaratory relief and \nvacatur  on  that  issue,  and  this  Court  has  held  that  permissive  intervention  is \nappropriate  when  “the  intervenors  seek  virtually  the  same  relief  as  the  named \nplaintiffs.”  Blatch, 1998 WL 265132, at *7.  Thus, under Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. \nDep’t  of  Just.,  161  F.R.D.  247, 254  (S.D.N.Y.  1995),  State  DOT  has  an interest \nsufficient to justify permissive intervention.   \nAccordingly, permissive intervention is appropriate. \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should enter an order giving State DOT \nleave to intervene as of right or, alternatively, by permission. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 31     Filed 03/19/25     Page 20 of 20\nDated: New York, New York \nRespectfully Submitted, \nMarch 19, 2025 \n \nLETITIA JAMES \nAttorney General of the State of New \nYork \n \n \nBy:  /s/ Andrew G.

CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:25-cv-01413-LJL \n   \nSEAN DUFFY, in his official capacity as   \nSecretary of the United States Department of  COMPLAINT-IN- INTERVENTION \nTransportation, GLORIA M. SHEPHERD, in \nher official capacity as Executive Director of \nthe Federal Highway Administration, \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nTRANSPORTATION, and FEDERAL \nHIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  In recent weeks, New York City has witnessed a minor miracle. Years of intense \nand combined efforts at the local, state, and federal levels have brought to fruition the decades-\nold promise of congestion pricing. The streets are clearer, the air is cleaner, and the millions of \nNew Yorkers who rely on public transit have secured a durable source of funding for this vital \ncivic resource.  \n2.  On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration declared an end to all that. \nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced by letter that the federal government had \npurported to rescind its previous agreement to authorize the Congestion Pricing Program. \nAlthough President Trump had repeatedly announced his opposition to the Program and his \nintention to end it, Secretary Duffy did not acknowledge that the decision was based on political \nanimosity to a successful program that was delivering results for New Yorkers. Instead, \nSecretary Duffy explained that he had discovered an unwritten restriction in federal law, a secret \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 2 of 32\nloophole establishing that the Congestion Pricing Program had never been lawfully authorized to \nbegin with. An hour later, the White House posted a statement from President Trump: \n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG \nLIVE THE KING!” The White House accompanied the statement with an image of President \nTrump, wearing a crown, posed against the Manhattan skyline. \n3.  Fortunately, President Trump is not a king, and the Congestion Pricing Program is \nnot dead. In our system of government neither presidents nor cabinet secretaries may impose \ntheir will on New Yorkers except by following the law. Secretary Duffy’s letter utterly fails this \ntest by resting on a legal theory so insubstantial as to appear pretextual. The Congestion Pricing \nProgram weathered numerous significant challenges before the cameras enabling tolling could \nfinally be turned on. The Trump administration’s feeble decree cannot justify turning them off. \n4.  For years, New York City was choking on cars. In the absence of any congestion \nrelief program, vehicles crawled through Manhattan’s Central Business District (“CBD”) in \nsome of the worst traffic in the world, spewing dangerous fumes, harming the region’s economy \nand quality of life, and exacerbating the climate crisis. In a typical year, more than one thousand \nCity residents would die prematurely from air pollution produced by motor vehicle traffic alone.  \n5.  Even as New York City struggled under the weight of hundreds of thousands of \nexcess vehicles, the main alternative—New York City’s public transit system—suffered the \nconsequences of chronic underinvestment. Many parts of the City’s transit infrastructure are over \none hundred years old, and repairs and capital improvements that would render the system more \nreliable and accessible were repeatedly deferred. City buses—stuck in New York City’s clogged \nstreets—crawled at the slowest speed of all major cities in the United States.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 32\n6.  New Yorkers found a solution. After years of advocacy by broad coalitions of \nNew Yorkers, the Legislature in 2019 enacted the Traffic Mobility Act. The Act rests on the \nLegislature’s determination that the city’s twin problems of traffic congestion and an \nunderfunded public transit system can be addressed together by imposing a toll on vehicle traffic. \nThe Act requires the establishment of a tolling program in the CBD, defined as Manhattan south \nof 60th street, except for FDR Drive and the West Side Highway. Tolling revenues, in turn, \nsupport capital projects to fund public transit and provide an alternative to motor vehicle traffic. \nBecause the tolled area includes federal-aid highways, the federal government took the position \nthat the Program required federal approval before it could begin. In June 2019, the New York \nState and City Departments of Transportation, and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority \n(“TBTA”)— an affiliate of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”)—sought an \nagreement to implement congestion pricing from the Federal Highway Administration \n(“FHWA”) under the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”). \n7.  The FHWA spent years studying the Congestion Pricing Program, ultimately \nauthorizing it by executing a VPPP agreement on November 21, 2024. The FHWA’s review \nincluded a comprehensive 958-page Environmental Assessment of the proposed Congestion \nPricing Program under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), produced after careful \nstudy and consideration of tens of thousands of public submissions. The Environmental \nAssessment concluded the Program would reduce levels of all pollutants in the New York City \nmetropolitan area that are regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. \n8.  On January 5, 2025, the Congestion Pricing Program implemented the \nrequirements imposed by the Traffic Mobility Act. It is the product of years of environmental \nplanning, infrastructure procurement, and coordination between local, state, and federal \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 32\nauthorities. The Program is essential to New York City’s future. It provides cleaner air, reduces \neconomically ruinous traffic congestion, and funds desperately needed improvements to the \npublic transit system that will allow it to better serve the needs of all New Yorkers, including \nNew Yorkers with disabilities.  \n9.  Within weeks of the program’s successful launch, Secretary Duffy announced his \ndecision to end it. The Secretary claimed to have discerned two novel limitations on the FHWA’s \nVPPP authority that appear nowhere in the text of the operative statute: First, that VPPP \nauthority implicitly excludes tolling an entire congested area (a form of congestion pricing \nknown as  “cordon pricing”); and second, that VPPP toll levels may not be set by accounting for \nthe need to accommodate displaced vehicle traffic through funding alternate transit options. \nAccording to the letter, these unwritten restrictions mean that the FHWA could never have \nlawfully authorized the Congestion Pricing Program. On this basis, Secretary Duffy disclaimed \nany need to consider the effects of ending the Congestion Pricing Program, announced that the \nFHWA had unilaterally withdrawn from the VPPP agreement, and declared that the program \nwould end. \n10.  Rather than identifying a policy judgment underlying his decision to end the \nCongestion Pricing Program, Secretary Duffy purported to rely entirely on a legal judgment. But \nthe legal reasoning in the letter is patently inadequate: it disregards both statutory text and \ndecades of history. The FHWA has long recognized that “cordon pricing” is a form of congestion \npricing available under the VPPP authority; the agency initially funded such a project more than \ntwenty years ago, and it has reported to Congress throughout on the use of VPPP authority. \nMeanwhile Congress has repeatedly preserved the FHWA’s VPPP authority without restricting \nthe FHWA’s straightforward and commonsense understanding that cordon pricing is a \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 32\npermissible form of congestion pricing. Secretary Duffy’s claim that it was impermissible to \ncalculate tolls by reference to the funding needed to sustain mass transit is equally specious. For \ncongestion pricing to work, there must be a reliable transit alternative for travelers displaced \nfrom the congested streets. Federal caselaw has long recognized that New York City’s roads and \npublic transit system are two sides of the same coin: funding public transit is a necessary \ncondition for reducing congestion on our streets.  \n11.  It is baffling that Secretary Duffy would rest his entire decision on such a flimsy \nlegal theory, except as a pretext. Ordinarily, when an agency considers abandoning its previous \nposition, federal law requires serious consideration of whether other actors have already spent \nenormous amounts of money and time in reliance on the agency’s guidance. Here, such \nconsideration would have to account for the hundreds of millions of dollars that have already \nbeen spent over the long years in which the federal government took the opposite position, and \nany lawful effort to unwind the current Congestion Pricing Program would have to consider less \ncostly and disruptive alternatives. The Trump administration evidently hoped to evade these \nrequirements by claiming that Secretary Duffy is merely correcting a previous legal error. But as \nthe Supreme Court made clear last time a cabinet secretary tried to evade judicial scrutiny by \nconcocting a thin pretext, federal law prohibits agencies from hiding their true reasons behind a \nconvenient fiction. \n12.  Further dooming the Secretary’s decision, there is no indication that the agency \neven attempted to consider the environmental consequences of the radical action it purports to \nrequire, even as the federal government’s own studies establish that ending congestion pricing \nwill harm New Yorkers’ air quality. Finally, while Secretary Duffy takes the position that he \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 32\nmay unilaterally end the Congestion Pricing Program, nothing in the statute actually provides \nhim this authority, rendering his action ultra vires. \n13.  The Court should vacate the Secretary’s decision and declare unlawful the Trump \nadministration’s attempt to unilaterally deprive New Yorkers of the cleaner air and clearer streets \nthat so many have worked toward for so long. The people of New York City deserve to breathe.  \nPARTIES \n14.  Intervenor-Plaintiff Riders Alliance is New York City’s grassroots nonprofit \nmembership organization of thousands of subway and bus riders who come together to work \ntoward a more reliable, accessible, and affordable public transit system. Riders Alliance \nmembers participate in a wide variety of activities to improve public transit, including \ncommunity meetings, rallies, press conferences, interviews, public testimony, visits with elected \nand appointed officials, and more. Since forming in 2012, the group’s organizers have canvassed \nsubway platforms and bus stops to recruit thousands of members to volunteer on a range of \ncampaigns. In 2018 and 2019, Riders Alliance members were integral to the adoption of the \nCongestion Pricing Program.  \n15.  Intervenor-Plaintiff Sierra Club is a grassroots environmental organization with \nmore than 800,000 members across the country; the Atlantic Chapter is responsible for \nmembership and activities in New York State. Sierra Club works to promote a cleaner, healthier, \nand more sustainable natural environment in its members’ communities. Sierra Club has \napproximately 50,000 members in New York State. \n16.  Numerous Riders Alliance and Sierra Club members live in and around the areas \nof New York City directly affected by the Congestion Pricing Program. As transit riders, many \nof whom depend on bus service and are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, these members \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 32\nhave a significant interest in the outcome of this litigation and the implementation of congestion \npricing. Ending the Congestion Pricing Program would harm them in numerous ways, including \nby: degrading the air quality around their homes, workplaces, and the outdoor areas they \nregularly use and enjoy; reducing their ability to access medical care and business opportunities \ndue to buses afflicted by the slowest speeds in the nation; and reducing their ability to use public \ntransport due to the defunding of the MTA’s previously budgeted accessibility improvements.  \n17.  Riders Alliance members include Bill Cryer. He and his family live less than one \nmile from the Kingsbridge bus depot. He works less than half a mile from the Holland Tunnel. \nHis child attends kindergarten less than one mile from the Trans-Manhattan Expressway, where \nInterstate 95 crosses Manhattan east of the George Washington Bridge. The Congestion Pricing \nProgram reduces traffic near the Holland Tunnel, improving air quality. Additionally, as part of \nthe Congestion Pricing Program, the MTA has prioritized transitioning the fossil fuel-burning \nbus fleet at the Kingsbridge Depot and the Gun Hill Depot to electric buses, in order to improve \nthe air quality near both locations. \n18.  Deborah Baldwin is a Riders Alliance member from Manhattan. She is a senior \ncitizen and is undergoing cancer treatments. She lives and works near the Queens-Midtown \nTunnel portal and is heavily exposed to car and truck exhaust fumes whenever she goes outside. \nMs. Baldwin also rides buses to visit her doctors and to other appointments; Manhattan’s bus \nspeeds are significantly improved by the Congestion Pricing Program. \n19.   Norma Ginez is a Riders Alliance member from the Bronx. She lives several \nblocks from the Cross Bronx Expressway. She has three children with special needs who also \nattend schools within several blocks of the Cross Bronx Expressway. She and her family depend \non buses to get around and often endure long waits for service in congested areas. They benefit \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 32\nfrom the mitigation projects that are funded by the Congestion Pricing Program, as well as from \nthe faster bus service that results from the Program.  \n20.  George Bettman is a Riders Alliance member from Brooklyn. He is a senior \ncitizen and suffers from impaired mobility. He rides the subway to work and to medical \nappointments, but reaching the subway platform in stations without elevators is extremely \ndifficult for him. The Congestion Pricing Program raises funds for the accessibility \nimprovements that he and other riders with disabilities desperately need. \n21.  Barbara Moore is a Riders Alliance member who has lived on Canal Street in \nlower Manhattan since 1978. She is seventy-two years old. She spends most of her time in the \nCBD and enjoys walking and biking outdoors. Because Ms. Moore was diagnosed with Chronic \nObstructive Pulmonary Disease, she must curtail her outdoor activities when the air quality is \npoor. She has also had to invest in two large indoor air purifiers to mitigate the degraded air \nquality around her home.  \n22.  Numerous individual Sierra Club members live in or near the Manhattan CBD, \nregularly engage in outdoor activities in the CBD, and are particularly vulnerable to the threats \nposed by air pollution in the CBD in the absence of the Congestion Pricing Program. \n23.  For example, Michelle M. Tokarczyk is a Sierra Club member who has lived for \ndecades in Chelsea, in the Manhattan CBD. Ms. Tokarczyk enjoys cycling on the Manhattan \nWaterfront Greenway in the CBD and taking long walks outdoors near her home in the \nManhattan CBD. But Ms. Tokarczyk is seventy-one years old and has diabetes and \nMicrovascular Cardiac Disease. She has been instructed by her cardiologist to avoid exerting \nherself outdoors when the air quality is impaired. As a result, she has been unable to ride her \nbicycle or take long walks outdoors at times due to the frequent high levels of air pollution in the \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 32\nManhattan CBD.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 24 U.S.C. § 1331 because \nthis case presents a federal question under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551 et seq.  \n31.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause Riders Alliance is headquartered in this district and a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district.  \nBACKGROUND \nNew York City’s air quality, traffic congestion, and public transit system were in desperate \nneed of reform. \n32.  New York City’s traffic congestion has been consistently among the worst in the \nUnited States. The cars, trucks, and buses that clog the roads are a major source of harmful air \npollution in the metropolitan area, and a significant contributor to climate change. Vehicles emit \nair pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (which lead to ozone formation), as well \nas toxics like benzene and volatile organic compounds that are known to cause and exacerbate \nhealth problems including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, asthma, and \ndiabetes. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 32\n33.  Air pollution from cars, trucks, and buses has been estimated to cause over 1,000 \ndeaths each year in New York City, as well as many emergency department admissions and \nmissed days of school and work.1 \n34.  Traffic emissions are by far the largest contributor to high ozone levels in the \nNew York City metropolitan area.2 For many years, the New York City metropolitan area has \nbeen out of compliance with federal air quality standards for ozone, and ozone levels in New \nYork City were higher in 2022 than any previous year of citywide air monitoring.3 \n35.  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to \nozone “can cause a number of health problems, including coughing, breathing difficulty, and \nlung damage. Exposure to ozone can make the lungs more susceptible to infection, aggravate \nlung diseases, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, and increase the risk of early death from \nheart or lung disease.” 4 People at greater risk from ozone exposure include people with lung \ndisease, older adults, and people who are active outdoors. \n \n1  Susan Anenberg et al., Int’l Council on Clean Transp., A Global Snapshot of the Air Pollution-\nRelated Health Impacts of Transportation Sector Emissions in 2010 and 2015, at 19 tbl.4, 38 \ntbl.A2 (2019), https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global_health_impacts_transport \n_emissions_2010-2015_20190226.pdf; see also Calvin A.

Traffic congestion causes people living in the New York City metropolitan area to \nexperience high levels of risk for cancer and respiratory difficulties caused by air toxics and \ndiesel particulate matter, compared to the rest of the United States.5  \n37.  Concentrations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are \nhighest in parts of the city with high traffic density—in particular, the CBD.6 \n38.  Older adults with lung disease and diabetes are particularly vulnerable to air \npollution. According to the EPA, “Ozone and Particulate Matter (PM) (especially smaller, fine \nparticle pollution called PM 2.5) have the greatest potential to affect the health of older adults. \nFine particle pollution has been linked to premature death, cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks, \nasthma attacks, and the development of chronic bronchitis. Ozone, even at low levels, can \nexacerbate respiratory diseases.”7 \n39.  While traffic congestion pollutes the air and snarls travel on the streets, below \nground New York City subway travelers face the consequences of aging infrastructure that has \nlong suffering from a major backlog of capital investment needs. Aboveground, bus speeds \nslowed by 28 percent in the CBD between 2010 and 2019.

Millions of people use public transit to reach and travel around New York City \neach day. In 2019, New York City subways served 1.7 billion passengers, and MTA buses \nserved 677.6 million passengers.9  \n41.  Underinvestment renders many parts of the transit system difficult to access, \nparticularly for riders with disabilities. Many parts of New York City’s transit infrastructure are \nover a century old and “essential capital needs remain to ensure a state of good repair and to \nbring MTA’s transit and rail assets into the 21st Century.”10 The MTA’s 2020–2024 capital \nprogram identifies “$52.0 billion in investments in the region’s subways, buses and commuter \nrailroads” that are required to improve and sustain adequate service.11 \n42.  During the spring and summer of 2017, New Yorker subway riders experienced \n“seemingly daily failures of the tracks, signals, switches or power systems, including three \nderailments,” leading to major travel delays. In June 2017, Governor Cuomo declared the MTA \n– specifically, the New York City Transit Authority – to be in a state of emergency.12  \nNew York Enacts Congestion Pricing Legislation. \n43.  In 2019, after years of advocacy and organizing, a broad coalition of New \nYorkers—ranging from grassroots organizations like Riders Alliance to a mix of community \nrepresentatives, business leaders, and government officials convened by the Governor to serve on \nthe Fix NYC Advisory Panel—successfully persuaded the Legislature and Governor to sign \nlegislation requiring the Congestion Pricing Program. \n44.

[for] residents, commuters, taxi and for-hire vehicle traffic, bus transit and \nemergency services” and “a significant contributor to decreased air quality.” N.Y. Veh. & Traf. \nLaw § 1701. Moreover, the Legislature determined that ongoing failures with New York City’s \nsubway infrastructure “continue to have a . . . deleterious impact on the health, safety, and \nlivelihood of commuters, tourists, resident New Yorkers, as well as . . . the economy of the state \nof New York,” such that “a long-term and sustainable solution is necessary in order to ensure \nstable and reliable funding to repair and revitalize this significantly important mass transit asset.” \nId. \n45.  To address the twin issues of overwhelming traffic and underfunded public transit \ninfrastructure, the Act directs the TBTA to establish a tolling program in the CBD. Id. § 1704-A.  \n46.  Because the tolled area includes federal-aid highways, the FHWA decided that the \nCongestion Pricing Program required federal approval before it could begin. The New York \nState and City Departments of Transportation, and the TBTA (collectively the “Project \nSponsors”) sought federal authorization for a tolling program in the Manhattan CBD within \nmonths of the Traffic Mobility Act becoming law. \nThe Federal Government Studies and Approves the Congestion Pricing Program. \n47.  Beginning in 1991, Congress established the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, \nlater renamed the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”). The VPPP allows FHWA to enter \nagreements with state and local authorities to reduce traffic and fund public transportation \nthrough the use of congestion pricing strategies.  \n48.  Months after it had received the initial VPPP application for the Manhattan CBD \nCongestion Pricing Program, the FHWA began a series of requests for further information.  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 32\n49.  First, in October 2019, the FHWA informed the Project Sponsors that the VPPP \n“appear[ed] to be the best potential fit” for the Congestion Pricing Program among the various \nfederal tolling programs. The FHWA asked for “a thorough traffic and revenue study” that \nwould explore traffic reductions, toll rates, effects on driving and public transit usage, and the \nuse of tolling revenues. The FHWA received the requested study on January 27, 2020. \n50.  Months passed, and in October 2020, the FHWA solicited and received an update \nabout the effects of COVID-19 on transit and traffic.  \n51.  More months passed, and on March 30, 2021, the FHWA announced that an \nEnvironmental Assessment (“EA”) was required to determine whether the Congestion Pricing \nProgram would have a significant impact on the environment.  \n52.  In spring 2021, the FHWA commenced a comprehensive Environmental \nAssessment of the proposed Congestion Pricing Program in accordance with NEPA. It released \nan 868-page draft Environmental Assessment along with appendices for public comment in \nAugust 2022.  \n53.  The FHWA considered nearly 70,000 public submissions on the draft, including \nmore than 14,000 individual submissions, oral testimony at public hearings, letters, e-mails, \nvoicemails, and submissions via an electronic form. The Project Sponsors conducted six public \nhearings.13  \n54.  In response to initial findings and public concern about impacts on some \nenvironmental justice communities, the Project Sponsors also convened an Environmental \nJustice Technical Advisory Group as well as an Environmental Justice Stakeholder Working \nGroup. After engaging with these groups and conducting a supplementary environmental justice \n \n13 EA Ch. 18 at 18-21–22, https://www.mta.info/document/110891.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 32\nanalysis, the Project Sponsors committed to $155 million in investments in various mitigation \nmeasures to ensure air quality benefits in environmental justice communities. \n55.  TBTA also held at least twenty-five public meetings on the Congestion Pricing \nProgram, the FHWA-conducted Environmental Assessment, and environmental justice \nimplications of the Program throughout the New York City metropolitan region in 2021 and \n2022. It received more than 22,000 individual comments and more than 55,000 form submissions \non the Environmental Assessment. \n56.  In May 2023, the FHWA approved the 958-page Final Environmental \nAssessment, along with thousands of pages of appendices. The FHWA concluded that the \nCongestion Pricing Program would reduce harmful air pollution both within the CBD and \nthroughout the region through reduction in traffic congestion and vehicle miles traveled. In \naddition, the Program would directly fund mitigation measures to improve air quality and health \nin environmental justice communities, and increase investment in public transit that would \nfurther encourage the use of public transit, further reduce congestion and vehicle miles traveled, \nand further improve New Yorkers’ air. \n57.  Governor Hochul hailed the federal environmental approval of the Congestion \nPricing Program in the summer of 2023, noting that the Program would deliver significant air \nquality improvements. That summer, as the city suffered through smoke from wildfires burning \nin Canada, Governor Hochul emphasized that relief was coming: “[F]or many New Yorkers in \nthe city, poor air quality isn’t a rare occurrence. It’s already making people sick in our own city. . \n. . We’re more cognizant of what’s going into our lungs these days, and we’re experiencing the \neffects of the wildfires in Canada. What about the wildfires that are happening on our own streets \nright here coming out of the exhaust pipes from all these vehicles? 700,000 vehicles enter the \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 17 of 32\ncentral business district every single day of the week. That’s almost impossible to comprehend. \nAnd so, buses, like I said, can’t move. They’re trying to do the right thing, people on buses. \nYou’re trying to make sure they’re doing what’s maybe more affordable for them, which is \nimportant. We have to keep those buses moving. These people have to get to their jobs too. It \ndoesn’t help that they have our buses immobilized.”14  \n58.  TBTA convened a Traffic Mobility Board to recommend a tolling structure for \nthe Program including toll rates, credits, discounts, and exemptions. The Traffic Mobility Board \nshared its recommendations with TBTA in December 2023 and held multiple public hearings. \nThe TBTA Board approved toll rates and exemptions in March 2024. In readiness for the \nProgram’s deployment, the infrastructure required to begin collecting the toll—including \nsensors, gantries, and transponders—was fully installed by that month.  \n59.  The FHWA studied the final toll rate and released its Reevaluation of the \nEnvironmental Assessment on June 14, 2024, confirming that no additional environmental \nreview was necessary. \n60.  Before tolling was set to begin on June 30, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a \n“pause” in the implementation of the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n61.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club sued Governor Hochul, the New York State \nDepartment of Transportation, the MTA, and TBTA to enforce their right to the benefits that the \nCongestion Pricing Program was set to deliver to their members.

On November 14, 2024, Governor Hochul announced an end to the “pause” on \nthe implementation of the Congestion Pricing Program, and that the Program would adopt an \napproach where the previously studied toll rates would phase in over several years. \n63.  On November 18, 2024, TBTA approved the phased-in approach, and on \nNovember 21, 2024, the FHWA approved a second reevaluation of the tolls, confirming that no \nfurther environmental analysis was required before the Congestion Pricing Program could begin. \n64.  On November 21, 2024, the FHWA also signed the VPPP agreement, authorizing \ntoll collection as a project approved under the VPPP.  \n65.  The agreement does not provide any means by which the FHWA may unilaterally \nterminate the agreement or the Congestion Pricing Program. It does, however, set forth terms \nunder which the TBTA may unilaterally decide to end the program. \nThe Program is Implemented and Begins Delivering Results for New Yorkers. \n66.  On January 5, 2025, the Congestion Pricing Program began to collect tolls. There \nis already significant evidence of the Program’s success: vehicle traffic is down, transit ridership \nis up, and foot traffic has risen over 2024 levels.15 \n \n15 Arun Venugopal, Vehicle Traffic Is Down in Manhattan, But Pedestrian Traffic Is Up, Data \nSays, Gothamist (Feb. 13, 2025), https://gothamist.com/news/vehicle-traffic-is-down-in-\nmanhattan-but-pedestrian-traffic-is-up-data-says.  \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 32\n67.  Shortly after the program began, a New York Times headline summarized the \nresults: “Less Traffic, Faster Buses: Congestion Pricing’s First Week.”16 While different bus \nroutes have experienced different levels of improvement at this early stage, The City reported \nthat express bus riders have benefitted enormously: “Commutes on Hudson River and East River \ncrossings for several express bus routes linking the boroughs with Manhattan have, on some \nlines, shaved more than 15 minutes off commuting times.”17 By February 24, the New York \nTimes reported that “New York’s congestion pricing plan raised $48.6 million in tolls during its \nfirst month, a strong start for the program that exceeded expectations and kept it on track to raise \nbillions of dollars for the region’s decaying mass transit system.”18  \n68.  In addition to the direct reduction in traffic, funds made available by the Program \nare already promising to improve New York’s air quality by prioritizing transformation of the \nMTA’s bus depots to accommodate electric buses. New charging infrastructure has been \ncommissioned for the Jamaica Bus Depot, with additional charging systems to be deployed at \nGun Hull and Queens Village to support new zero-emissions buses. \nThe Federal Government Purports to End the Program. \n69.

On January 30, Representative Nicole Malliotakis, who had spoken with \nPresident Trump about their shared dislike for the Congestion Pricing Program, stated that “this \nis a priority task that has been given to the Department of Transportation by the president, and he \nis serious about doing something.”19  \n70.  On February 19, 2025, by letter from Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the \nDepartment of Transportation carried out the “priority task” it had been given and announced the \npurported recission of its previous agreement to implement the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n71.  Although the letter recited several policy disagreements that President Trump and \nothers had expressed about the Congestion Pricing Program, and although Secretary Duffy \nwould subsequently describe his action as “[t]erminat[ing] NYC elitist, anti-worker congestion \npricing,”20 Secretary Duffy maintained that his decision to try and rescind federal approval rested \nsolely on legal judgment. According to his letter, his reading of federal law led him to conclude \nthat “FHWA lacked statutory authority to approve the cordon pricing tolling under the CBDTP \npilot project.”21 \n72.  Secretary Duffy cited “two reasons” for his conclusion: First, all roads into the \nCBD are tolled so as to discourage vehicles from entering, “a method of tolling known as \n‘cordon pricing.’” Cordon pricing mechanisms do not include toll-free lanes or approaches, and \naccording to Secretary Duffy, “no statute contemplates cordon pricing in a situation where tolls \n \n19 Benjamin Oreskes et al., Trump Administration Considers Halting Congestion Pricing, N.Y. \nTimes (Jan. 30, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/nyregion/nyc-trump-congestion-\npricing.html.  \n20 Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy), X (Feb. 24, 2025 9:28 AM), https://x.com/SecDuffy/ \nstatus/1894031690256818515.  \n21 Letter from Sean Duffy, Sec’y of Transp., to Kathy Hochul, Governor of N.Y.

Second, Secretary Duffy asserted that “the imposition of tolls under the \n[Congestion Pricing Program] appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the \nMetropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) system as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.” \nAccording to Secretary Duffy, despite the mountains of evidence demonstrating that the \nCongestion Pricing Program was developed as a durable response to New York City’s gridlock, \nthe Program is in fact an impermissible attempt to fund mass transit. In his interpretation of the \nstatute, “[the] VPPP does not authorize tolls that are calculated based on considerations separate \nfrom reducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.” And because Secretary Duffy \nmaintains that any connection between “improving the transit system” and reducing congestion \nis “attenuated,” in his view the VPPP prohibits considering the MTA’s need to accommodate the \ndisplaced vehicle traffic through sufficiently funded mass transit. \n74.  Secretary Duffy’s letter goes on to concede that there are reliance interests \ndetrimentally affected by his abrupt abandonment of years of FHWA policy. But, according to \nSecretary Duffy, basing the decision on purported statutory grounds allows the government to \nsummarily ignore any reasoned consideration of these interests because “any reliance interests \ncannot overcome the conclusion that FHWA’s approval was not authorized by law.” \n75.  Secretary Duffy’s reasoning suffers from significant and obvious flaws that \nsuggest that his purported statutory conclusion is a pretext, chosen specifically to try and avoid \n \n22 Id. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 22 of 32\nthe enormous reliance interests that would otherwise weigh strongly against the abrupt reversal \nof federal policy. \n76.  First, Secretary Duffy maintains that federal law in general, and the VPPP in \nparticular, has never contemplated “cordon pricing” as a permissible congestion pricing strategy, \nexcept where toll-free options are available to drivers.  \n77.  In fact, cordon pricing has for decades been recognized by the FHWA as a form \nof congestion pricing, and it has awarded funds to study cordon pricing projects under the VPPP \nauthority.  \n78.  As early as 2002, the FHWA announced a VPPP project for “cordon pricing” in \nFort Meyers Beach. See Press Release, FHWA 31-02, U.S. Transportation Secretary Mineta \nAnnounces $56.3 Million for States in Highway Discretionary Funds (July 12, 2002), 2002 WL \n1487104. Cordon pricing presented a natural solution to the congested roadways of the Town of \nFort Myers Beach, Florida, because there was no ability to add new roads or widen existing ones. \nThe VPPP project funded a study of a variable toll that would apply at every approach to the \ntown, in an attempt to reduce the number of vehicles on its overloaded streets. In other words, \nthe FHWA approved a VPPP project more than two decades ago that “provides no toll-free \noption for many drivers,” a cordon pricing strategy “where tolls are inescapable”—precisely the \ntype of project that Secretary Duffy now asserts the “FHWA has never before approved.” And \nthe FHWA regularly reported its VPPP projects to Congress. Although the 2002 project was \nultimately cancelled before final implementation due to political opposition to tolls, there is no \nindication that Congress or the FHWA ever considered the contemplated cordon pricing strategy \nto be outside of the VPPP authorization. On the contrary, FHWA continued for years to describe \nthe Florida cordon pricing project in lists of VPPP projects in its quarterly reports.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 23 of 32\n79.  In subsequent years, FHWA has continued to recognize cordon pricing as an \nimportant element of the congestion pricing framework. In 2008, for example, the agency issued \na primer on congestion pricing, identifying “four main types of pricing strategies.” 23 The FHWA \nidentified “cordon pricing” as one of these four main strategies: “Cordon pricing involves \ncharging a fee to enter or drive within a congested area, usually a city center.”24 The FHWA \nobserved that such strategies have been deployed around the world beginning in 1975, and that \nNew York was considering a cordon pricing scheme in 2008.25 \n80.  In the decades since FHWA authorized the study of cordon pricing in Florida \nunder its VPPP authority, Congress has preserved the FHWA’s VPPP authority and ability to \nenter into VPPP agreements without ever disapproving or modifying the agency’s \nstraightforward and commonsense interpretation of that authority as including cordon pricing \nprojects. In 2005, Congress reauthorized the VPPP in Section 1604(a) of the Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Pub. L. No. \n109-59. Although it modified aspects of the program, it made no changes to the operative \ndefinition of eligible congestion pricing programs. When Congress most recently acted to alter \nfederal highway programs through the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act \n(MAP-21), Pub. L. No. 112-141 (2012), it once again preserved the VPPP authority and \nlanguage without alteration. \n81.  Secretary Duffy’s letter fails to consider important aspects of the problem it \nostensibly addresses. The Secretary’s letter does not address the VPPP’s history or identify any \n \n23 FHWA, U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Congestion Pricing, A Primer: Overview 4 (2008), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08039/fhwahop08039.pdf.  \n24 Id. at 6. \n25 Id. at 6, 17. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 24 of 32\nstatutory text disapproving or limiting the definition of congestion pricing so as to exclude \ncordon pricing strategies.  \n82.  Secretary Duffy’s second stated reason for his decision is no more compelling. \nSecretary Duffy maintains that the VPPP does not authorize the Congestion Pricing Program \nbecause the tolls involve consideration of the need to fund the MTA. But decades of precedent \nestablish that New York City has an integrated transit system, so that funding alternative transit \noptions improves service for the cars that remain in the tolled area. And beyond caselaw, basic \ncommon sense dictates that one cannot reduce vehicle congestion on New York City’s bridges, \nroads, and tunnels without providing a functional alternative to transport the displaced travelers. \nFunding the MTA sufficiently to perform that task is the only way in which congestion pricing \ncould work, and both federal law and the FHWA itself have long recognized the permissibility of \nthis type of funding. \n83.  As an initial matter, there is no serious dispute that federal law authorizes the \nspending of revenues from road tolls on non-road projects. See Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23-CV-10365 (LJL), 2024 WL 5199945, at *16–17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (“[I]t is \nCongress’ unmistakably clear intent that a public authority be permitted to collect funds that \nexceed a toll road’s costs and spend those funds on non-toll road projects.”). \n84.  Nor can there be a serious dispute that funding public transportation is an \nimportant tool for reducing traffic congestion in New York City. More than thirty years ago, a \nfederal court explained that drivers who pay bridge tolls derive congestion benefits when the \ntolls are used to fund public transit in and around New York City: “[T]he commuter rail facilities \nthat serve the eastern and northern suburbs of New York City, along with the subways and buses \nin New York City, effectively reduce traffic on the same arteries, river crossings and streets that \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 25 of 32\nare used by commuters from Staten Island who use the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.” Molinari v. \nNew York Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., 838 F. Supp. 718, 726 (E.D.N.Y. 1993).  \n85.  This basic premise has been sustained repeatedly for many years. The direct \nrelationship between funding the MTA and reducing traffic congestion has been recognized \nagain and again by the federal courts. See, e.g., Janes v. Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., 977 \nF. Supp. 2d 320, 341 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff’d, 774 F.3d 1052 (2d Cir. 2014) (“Defendants have \nimpressively demonstrated the value of mass transit in reducing congestion on bridges and \ntunnels throughout New York City.”); Angus Partners LLC v. Walder, 52 F. Supp. 3d 546, 570 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2014) (“[T]he uncontested benefits that MTA’s functionally integrated transit system \nconfers to TBTA toll-payers include reductions in traffic congestion on TBTA bridges and \ntunnels, along with associated reductions in fuel costs, stress, auto emissions, and wait times.”). \n86.  The Congestion Pricing Program specifically rests on the straightforward \nrelationship between funding transit alternatives and reducing traffic congestion. “The premise of \nthe Tolling Program and the evidence that supports it demonstrates that the improvements to the \ntransit system from the toll will provide benefits to motorists who use the roadways.” Chan, \n2024 WL 5199945, at *21.  \n87.  Along with the courts, the FHWA has long recognized this feature of congestion \npricing. As the agency explains in its 2008 primer, “Congestion pricing can generate substantial \nrevenues from tolls,” which, after paying operating costs, can “support alternatives to driving \nalone, such as public transit.”26  \n \n26 FHWA, Congestion Pricing, A Primer, supra note 23, at 7. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 26 of 32\n88.  The contrary theory proposed by Secretary Duffy is absurd. There is no \npossibility of setting a reasonable toll that accomplishes congestion reduction without a \nconcomitant funding of public transit to accommodate the displaced travelers.  \n89.  Secretary Duffy’s second theory fails to consider important aspects of the \nproblem it ostensibly addresses, addressing neither the caselaw describing New York City’s \nintegrated transit system, nor the basic requirement of providing reliable alternate transit.  \nRiders Alliance and Sierra Club Members Will Be Harmed if Defendants are Allowed to End \nthe Program. \n \n90.  Ending implementation of the Congestion Pricing Program means that New \nYorkers will endure approximately 400,000 additional vehicle miles traveled each day.27 This \nwill deprive Riders Alliance and Sierra Club members of benefits to air quality that have only \njust begun.28 Reevaluation 1 of the CBD Tolling Program estimated that congestion pricing \nwould sharply reduce particulate matter levels in the Central Business District by 11 percent and \nfine particulate matter by 10.49 percent.29 \n91.  In addition, it the Congestion Pricing Program is halted, the Project Sponsors will \nno longer be implementing the promised mitigation measures in environmental justice areas that \nwould have decreased air pollution below the baseline levels existing prior to the Program. For \nexample, replacing up to 1000 highly polluting transport refrigeration units (“TRUs”) at the \nHunts Point Market in the Bronx, as called for as part of the implementation of congestion \n \n27 See EA Ch. 10 at 10-12, tbl.10-3, https://new.mta.info/document/111101.  \n28 Id. at 10-21. \n29 CBD Tolling Program Reevaluation at 93, tbl.10-3 (June 2024), \nhttps://new.mta.info/document/142711.  \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 27 of 32\npricing, will substantially improve air quality by removing tons of nitrogen oxides and fine \nparticulate matter emissions from the air each year.30 \n92.  Finally, Riders Alliance and Sierra Club members will suffer from the foregone \nMTA safety, usability, and accessibility improvements that the Congestion Pricing Program \nwould have funded. The buses they depend on will slow down, stations will continue to \ndeteriorate, subway platforms will remain inaccessible to members with disabilities, and the \nnecessary signal improvements for increased service will be once again deferred. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act — Impermissible Pretext \n \n93.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n94.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires reasoned agency decisionmaking and \nauthorizes the judiciary to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n95.  “[I]n order to permit meaningful judicial review, an agency must ‘disclose the \nbasis’ of its action.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780 (2019) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 167–169 (1962)). \n96.  “Several points, considered together, reveal a significant mismatch between the \ndecision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.” Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 783.  \n \n30 EA Appendix 17D at 77, https://www.mta.info/document/111056.   \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 28 of 32\n97.  The public record indicates that President Trump instructed his administration to \nimmediately terminate the Congestion Pricing Program based on his political opposition to the \nProgram.  \n98.  Very shortly after the Secretary of Transportation took office, he purported to \nannounce a radical change in the agency’s years-long course of conduct based on obviously \nflawed legal rationales.  \n99.  The Secretary then pointed to the rationale identified—dubious statutory \ntheories—as justifying complete disregard for the reliance interests that otherwise would appear \nto have constrained the agency from abruptly declaring an abrupt about-face on an enormously \nexpensive, consequential, years-long policy. “When an agency changes course, as [FHWA] did \nhere, it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance \ninterests that must be taken into account.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of \nCalifornia, 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (cleaned up). Rather than seriously evaluate the reliance \ninterests and consider alternatives, the purported reliance on a statutory pretext allowed the \nagency to short-circuit this administrative process.  \n100.  Secretary Duffy also appears to believe that the use of a statutory rationale frees \nhim from any environmental review obligations. While the agency had spent years studying the \nenvironmental impact of implementing the Congestion Pricing Program, the agency did not even \nattempt to study the environmental impacts of abruptly and fully turning the program off.  \n101.  Thus, although the Congestion Pricing Program was debated and studied for \nyears, and although the significant reliance and environmental interests implicated in any \ndecision would appear to bar any immediate termination of the Program, Secretary Duffy \nnonetheless announced that he had discovered a convenient rationale that required the Program \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 29 of 32\nbe ended without further review. Secretary Duffy maintained that it was for this reason alone that \nhe had decided to swiftly eliminate the Congestion Pricing Program.  \n102.  “Altogether, the evidence tells a story that does not match the explanation the \nSecretary gave for his decision.” Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 784. The Administrative Procedure \nAct bars such pretextual decision-making: “The reasoned explanation requirement of \nadministrative law, after all, is meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for \nimportant decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public. \nAccepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.” Id. at 785. \n103.  Because Secretary Duffy’s decision purports to rely on a basis that is not the \ngenuine reason for his decision, the decision must be set aside under the APA. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act — Substantively Arbitrary and Capricious \nDue to Erroneous Legal Premise \n \n104.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n105.  When an “[agency] action is based upon a determination of law as to which the \nreviewing authority of the courts does come into play, an order may not stand if the agency has \nmisconceived the law.” S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943). \n106.  So long as an agency maintains that its action is compelled by law, its action is \nsubstantively arbitrary and capricious if it depends on an erroneous legal conclusion.  \n107.  The decision to end the Congestion Pricing Program is based on purported \nrestrictions in federal law that appear nowhere in statutory text and contradict decades of shared \nunderstanding between the agency and Congress. The decision cannot stand because the agency \nhas misconceived the law.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 30 of 32\n108.  Secretary Duffy’s letter states that the VPPP authority must be read to implicitly \nexclude cordon pricing. But as described above, the FHWA has for decades recognized cordon \npricing as a form of congestion pricing eligible under the VPPP, Congress has repeatedly \nreauthorized and left intact the authority, and nothing in the statute draws a distinction between \ncordon pricing and other forms of congestion pricing. \n109.  Secretary Duffy’s letter also states that the tolls for the Congestion Pricing \nProgram were impermissibly set in consideration of the financial needs of the integrated system \nof alternate transportation that would be required to accommodate displaced vehicle traffic. But \nboth federal courts and the FHWA have recognized for decades that funding the MTA works to \nreduce congestion on the roads. New York City’s transit system is inextricably interconnected, \nand there is no indication that Congress silently intended to bar such interconnected systems \nfrom consideration under the VPPP.  \n110.  Because the agency has justified its action on the basis of a legal requirement it \nhas fundamentally misconstrued, the action must set aside under the APA. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4332 \n111.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n112.  NEPA requires federal agencies, including the FHWA, to take a hard look at the \ndirect, indirect, and cumulative impacts of proposed major federal actions that significantly \naffect the quality of the human environment. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). These include the \n“reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action,” “reasonably \nforeseeable adverse effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,” and \nconsideration of alternatives. \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 31 of 32\n113.  Terminating the Congestion Pricing Program is a proposed major federal action. \n114.  Based on the Environmental Assessment that FHWA approved, the Congestion \nPricing Program produces improved air quality in the Manhattan CBD and throughout the \nregion. \n115.  Terminating the Congestion Pricing Program would naturally be expected to \naffect the quality of the human environment by reducing air quality due to a direct rise in \nvehicles miles traveled, and by depriving New Yorkers of the mitigation projects and other \nimprovements funded by the Program. \n116.  Yet Defendants did not even attempt to assess whether there would be \nenvironmental impacts, whether the impacts would rise to the level of significance, whether \nalternatives were available, or whether the public should be informed about the environmental \nconsequences of the agency’s action. \n117.  Defendants therefore violated NEPA. \nCOUNT IV \nUltra Vires \n118.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in \neach paragraph above and incorporate such allegations by reference as if set forth herein. \n119.  “Generally, judicial relief is available to one who has been injured by an act of a \ngovernment official which is in excess of his express or implied powers.” Harmon v. Brucker, \n355 U.S. 579, 581–82 (1958)). \n120.  There is no provision in federal law, the VPPP, or FHWA regulations that permits \nthe Secretary of Transportation or any other federal official to unilaterally revoke a VPPP \nagreement and require termination of an agreed-upon tolling program. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 38     Filed 03/27/25     Page 32 of 32\n121.  Secretary Duffy has nonetheless purported to require the unilateral recission of \nthe VPPP agreement and the end of the Congestion Pricing Program. Secretary Duffy’s actions \nare undertaken in excess of his express or implied powers and threaten to inflict injury on Riders \nAlliance and Sierra Club members.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Riders Alliance and Sierra Club respectfully request that the Court: \na)  Declare that Secretary Duffy’s decision to unilaterally revoke the VPPP and require the \nend of the Congestion Pricing Program on the basis of a pretextual and misconstrued \nlegal rationale is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; \nb)  Declare that Defendants have violated NEPA by, inter alia, failing to conduct any NEPA \nanalysis, failing to provide any opportunity for public participation, and failing to take a \n“hard look” at the potential environmental impacts of their actions; \nc)  Vacate Secreatary Duffy’s decision; \nd)  Award Riders Alliance and Sierra Club their reasonable costs of litigation, including \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412 and/or other authority; and  \ne)  Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nDated:  March 27, 2025 \nNew York, NY \nRespectfully submitted, \n \ns/Dror Ladin \nDror Ladin \nEarthjustice \n48 Wall Street, 15th Floor \nNew York, NY 10005 \n(917) 410-8701 \ndladin@earthjustice.org  \n \nCounsel for Intervenor-Plaintiffs \nRiders Alliance and Sierra Club \n32 ",

Shepherd, \nin her official capacity as Executive Director of the Federal Highway Administration, \nthe  United  States  Department  of  Transportation  (“USDOT”),  and  the  Federal \nHighway Administration (“FHWA”), and allege as follows on information and belief: \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 2 of 35\n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  On January 5, 2025, plaintiff Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority \n(“Triborough”)  began  collecting  tolls  from  motor  vehicles  entering  Manhattan’s \n“central business district,” pursuant to New York’s Traffic Mobility Act, N.Y. Vehicle \n& Traffic L. §§ 1704-a, 1705, and the federal Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”) \nestablished  by  the  Intermodal  Surface  Transportation  Efficiency  Act  of  1991 \n(“ISTEA”), Pub. L. 102-240, § 1012(b) (December 18, 1991), 23 U.S.C. § 149 note. \n2.  On February 19, defendant Secretary Sean Duffy notified Kathy Hochul, \nGovernor of New York State, that he was rescinding defendant FHWA’s approval of \ncongestion pricing in the central business district and unilaterally terminating the \ncooperative  agreement  that  FHWA  had  signed  under  the  VPPP  (“cooperative \nagreement”).  See Exhibit 1 (Letter from Secretary Sean Duffy to Governor Kathy \nHochul (Feb. 19, 2025)); Exhibit 2 (Agreement among FHWA, State DOT, Triborough \nand New York City Department of Transportation (Nov. 21, 2024)).  Although the \nSecretary stated that he was terminating the agreement because FHWA had lacked \nauthority  to  enter  into  it  under  ISTEA,  the  Secretary  also  indicated  that  the \ntermination was motivated by the President’s opposition to congestion pricing as well \nas the Secretary’s own policy disagreement with New York State. The Secretary \nstated that, in his view, congestion pricing in Manhattan was not a “fair deal.”  \nExhibit 1 at 2. \n  2   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 35\n \n3.  On  February  20,  the  President  of  the  United  States  announced, \n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD.  Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. \nLONG LIVE THE KING.” \n4.  Also  on  February  20,  2025,  defendant Executive  Director  Shepherd \nnotified State DOT, the New York City Department of Transportation (“NYCDOT”), \nand Triborough that, pursuant to Secretary Duffy’s February 19 letter, “[State DOT] \nand its project sponsors must cease the collection of tolls on Federal-aid highways in \nthe  [central  business  district]  by  March  21,  2025.”    See  Exhibit  3  (Letter  from \nExecutive Director Gloria Shepherd to Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez and \nothers  (Feb.  20,  2025)).    The  Project  Sponsors  are  State  DOT,  NYCDOT,  and \nTriborough. \n5.  The President is not a king.  Instead, he is subject to the rule of law and \nwhen he or his subordinate acts without authority, as Secretary Duffy did when he \npurported to terminate federal approval of the congestion pricing program, that \naction is invalid.   \n6.  The Secretary asserted that the congestion pricing program was “not an \neligible [VPPP]” for two reasons: (1) the congestion pricing program creates “cordon \npricing,” meaning that there is not a toll-free means to enter the central business \ndistrict;  and  (2)  the  toll  rate  was  calculated  “primarily”  to  raise  revenue  for \nMetropolitan Transit Authority (“MTA”) capital projects, as opposed to reducing \ncongestion or meeting other road-related goals, which, according to the Secretary, are \nthe only authorized purposes of congestion pricing tolls.  Exhibit 1 at 2. \n  3   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 35\n \n7.  Defendants’ purported termination of the cooperative agreement was \narbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory authority, \nand without observance of procedure required by law under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) & (D), as well as ultra vires.  \n8.  The termination by defendants was not in accordance with law for \nseveral reasons. First, defendants lacked authority to unilaterally terminate the \ncooperative agreement.  The rescission was also in excess of statutory authority and \nultra vires for the same reason.  \n9.   Second, even if defendants acted with lawful authority, the termination \nwas  not  in  accordance  with  law  and  was  also  without  observance  of  procedure \nrequired by law because defendants were required to give State DOT, NYCDOT, and \nTriborough an opportunity to be heard before the agreement was rescinded, which \nthey did not do.    \n10.  Third,  the  termination  was  arbitrary  and  capricious  and  not  in \naccordance with law because Secretary Duffy’s proffered rationales for the reversal \nof FHWA’s prior determination that the congestion pricing program is eligible for the \nVPPP are erroneous.    \n11.  Secretary Duffy stated that the VPPP does not allow cordon pricing but \nnothing in the VPPP supports that interpretation, and FHWA has determined in the \npast  that  congestion  pricing  includes  cordon  pricing,  which  it  also  called  “area \npricing.”  Secretary Duffy states that cordon pricing has only been used on interstate \n  4   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 35\n \nhighways where drivers have alternative non-toll routes, but according to FHWA, \ntolls on highways are not cordon or area pricing.   \n12.  Secretary  Duffy  also  stated  that  congestion  pricing  was  “primarily \ndriven by the need to raise revenue for the [MTA],” which he asserts is forbidden by \nthe VPPP.  Exhibit 1 at 2.  Congestion pricing for entry into the central business \ndistrict of Manhattan was designed both to reduce congestion and to raise revenue \nfor the MTA.  In any event and contrary to the Secretary’s claim, the VPPP permits \nstates and local government authorities to include revenue objectives when setting \ntoll rates, as evidenced by the language of the statute, ISTEA § 1012(b)(3), which \nprovides that toll revenues may be used to fund other transportation infrastructure \nprojects.   \n13.  Fourth,  the  termination  was  not  in  accordance  with  law  because \ndefendants did not review the potential environmental impacts of their decision to \nterminate,  as  required  by  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  42  U.S.C. \n§§ 4332(C), 4336(b)(2).  \n14.  For these reasons and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), the Court should \n(a) declare that the termination of the cooperative agreement was not in accordance \nwith  law,  arbitrary  and  capricious,  in  excess  of  statutory  authority,  without \nobservance of procedure required by law, and ultra vires; and  (b) hold unlawful and \nset aside the purported termination of the cooperative agreement and the directive \nthat State DOT, NYCDOT, and Triborough cease the collection of tolls by March 21, \n2025.  \n  5   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 35\n \nPARTIES \n \n15.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to \n23 U.S.C. § 1331 because this case presents a federal question under the laws of the \nUnited States, including the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.   \n21.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this \ndistrict. \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \n \nNew York’s Traffic Mobility Act \n22.  Traffic congestion has long plagued the New York metropolitan area.  \nFor decades, congestion has stymied economic growth and harmed the environment \nand public health and safety, not to mention the quality of life in the region.   \n  6   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 35\n \n23.  Congestion on New York City roads, and in the central business district \nof Manhattan in particular, has a serious negative impact on public health.  As the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized, higher vehicle traffic leads to \nhigher vehicle emissions, which are associated with negative health impacts like \n“asthma  onset  and  aggravation,  cardiovascular  disease,  reduced  lung  function, \nimpaired  lung  development  in  children,  pre-term  and  low-birthweight  infants, \nchildhood leukemia, and premature death.”1  FHWA has consistently acknowledged \nthat “less vehicle traffic can improve air quality and reduce chronic lower respiratory \ndiseases.”2  \n24.  Congestion also increases travel times, eroding worker productivity, \nreducing bus and paratransit service, raising the cost of deliveries, and impeding the \nmovement of emergency vehicles.  A 2018 study estimated that “traffic congestion \n[would] be a $100 billion drag” on the metropolitan-area economy over the next five \nyears and identified Manhattan below 60th street—where a quarter of the region’s \neconomic activity is concentrated—as the primary source of traffic congestion.3   \n25.  In 2019, the New York State Legislature enacted the Traffic Mobility \nAct, which authorized and directed Triborough to implement a congestion tolling \nprogram in the central business district.

The Act’s legislative findings declare that traffic in New York—which \n“ranks second worst among cities in the United States and third worst among cities \nin the world” and is estimated to cost the metropolitan economy more than “one \nhundred  billion  dollars  over  the  next  five  years”—is  “crippling”  for  “residents, \ncommuters, taxi and for-hire vehicle traffic, bus transit and emergency services” and \n“a significant contributor to decreased air quality.”  Id. § 1701.   \n27.  The Legislature further found that the underfunding of New York City’s \nsubway infrastructure has “a significant deleterious impact on the health, safety, and \nlivelihood of commuters, tourists, resident New Yorkers” as well as “the economy of \nthe state of New York,” such that “a long-term and sustainable solution is necessary \nin order to ensure stable and reliable funding” for this “important mass transit asset.”  \nId.   \n28.  Consequently, the Legislature declared that to ensure the “public health \nand safety of New York’s residents,” the creation of a congestion pricing program in \nthe Manhattan central business district was “a matter of substantial state concern.”  \nId. \n29.  The Act authorizes and directs Triborough to “establish the central \nbusiness district tolling program,” id. § 1704(1), grants Triborough the power “to \nestablish and charge variable tolls and fees for vehicles entering or remaining in the \n[central  business  district],”4  and  authorizes  Triborough  “to  make  rules  and \n \n4 As delineated by the Act, the central business district encompasses the geographic area of Manhattan \nsouth and inclusive of 60th Street, but not including the FDR Drive, the West Side Highway, the \nBattery Park Underpass, and any surface roadway portion of the Hugh L.

The goals of the Act are to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in that \ndistrict and raise funds for the capital needs of the MTA subway, bus and commuter \nrail operations.  Id. § 1701.   \nThe VPPP \n31.  Tolls are generally prohibited on federal-aid highways, 23 U.S.C. § 301, \nsubject to exceptions. \n32.  A “federal-aid highway” is “a public highway eligible for assistance \nunder [Title 23, Chapter 1] other than a highway functionally classified as a local \nroad or rural minor collector.”  23 U.S.C. § 101(a)(6).  \n33.  Congress  enacted  ISTEA,  to  foster  “a  National  Intermodal \nTransportation  System,”  consisting  of  “all  forms  of  transportation  in  a  unified, \ninterconnected manner.”  ISTEA § 2, 49 U.S.C. § 101 note.  \n34.  Among other things, ISTEA established two programs that authorized \ntolls on federal-aid highways.  First, it created the “Basic Program” that authorized \ntolls  on  highways,  bridges,  and  tunnels  pursuant  to  certain  conditions.  ISTEA \n§ 1012(a), 23 U.S.C. § 129. \n35.  ISTEA  also  created  the  “Congestion  Pricing  Pilot  Program,”  later \nrenamed the VPPP, which directed the Secretary of Transportation to “solicit the \nparticipation of State and local governments and public authorities for one or more \n  9   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 35\n \ncongestion pricing pilot projects.” ISTEA § 1012(b), 23 U.S.C. § 149 note. See also Pub. \nL. 105-178 § 1216 (June 9, 1998) (renaming the program to the VPPP).  \n36.  As FHWA describes it, the VPPP is “intended to demonstrate whether \nand  to  what  extent  roadway  congestion  may  be  reduced  through  application  of \ncongestion pricing strategies, and the magnitude of the impact of such strategies on \ndriver behavior, traffic volumes, transit ridership, air quality and availability of \nfunds for transportation programs.”5   \n37.  FHWA has recognized that congestion pricing can reduce delays and \nstress, allow for more deliveries per hour for businesses, improve transit speeds and \nreliability of service, and save lives by shortening the incident response times for \nambulances and emergency personnel.6   \n38.  Also according to FHWA, congestion pricing “is a way of harnessing the \npower  of  the  market  to  reduce  the  waste  associated  with  traffic  congestion.”7  \nCongestion pricing is effective because it shifts “some rush hour highway travel to \nother transportation modes or to off-peak periods.  By removing even just a small \nfraction of the vehicles from a congested roadway, pricing helps the system to flow \nmore efficiently.”  Id. \n \n5 Value Pricing Pilot Program, U.S. FED.

FHWA  has  also  recognized  that  congestion  pricing  includes  cordon \npricing.8   In contrast to charging tolls for using particular roads, bridges, tunnels, or \nferries,  “[z]one-based  pricing,  including  cordon  and  area  pricing,  involves  either \nvariable or fixed charges to drive within or into a congested area within a city.”9 \n40.  “Revenues generated by any pilot project under [the VPPP] must be \napplied to projects eligible under [Title 23].”  ISTEA § 1012(b)(3), 23 U.S.C. 149 note. \nPursuant to 23 U.S.C. § 133(b)(1)(C), eligible projects include public transportation \nprojects under 49 U.S.C. §§ 5307(a)(1) and 5337(b)(1).

The  VPPP  does  not  grant  the  defendants  unilateral  authority  to \nterminate a cooperative agreement. \nTermination of a Cooperative Agreement Under 2 C.F.R. Part 200 \n47.  FHWA  has  determined  that  agreements  authorizing  projects  that \nrequire tolling authority under the VPPP are cooperative agreements, even where \nsuch agreements do not include a federal funding component.11 \n48.  FHWA has adopted the Office of Management and Budget’s agency-wide \nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for \nFederal Awards (“Uniform Guidance”), 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  See id. § 1201.1. \n49.  The  Uniform  Guidance  sets  out  specific  conditions  under  which  an \naward, including a cooperative agreement, may be terminated:  \na.  by the agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms and \nconditions” of the award;  \nb.  by the agency with the “consent” of the recipient;  \nc.  by the recipient; and \nd.  by the agency “pursuant to the terms and conditions” of the award.   \nId. § 200.340(a). \n \n \n11 Value Pricing Pilot Program, U.S. FED.

The  Uniform  Guidance  also  provides  that,  before  an  agency  may \nterminate an award, including a cooperative agreement, an agency must provide \nwritten notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Id. §§ 200.341(a), 342. \nThe National Environmental Policy Act  \n51.  The National Environmental Policy Act requires that, before a federal \nagency takes a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment,” the agency is required to prepare a report that discusses, among other \nthings,  the  action’s  “reasonably  foreseeable  environmental  effects.”    42  U.S.C. \n§ 4332(2)(C).  \n52.  A “major Federal action” is “an action that the agency carrying out such \naction determines is subject to substantial Federal control and responsibility.” Id. \n§ 4336e(10).  \n53.  To determine whether a major federal action will significantly affect the \nquality of the environment, an agency may prepare an “environmental assessment” \n(“EA”).  See, e.g., id. § 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119. \n54.  Agencies are required to take a hard look at the reasonably foreseeable \nsocial, economic, and environmental impacts of a proposed action and its alternatives.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 4336; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b); Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983).  \n55.  Agencies are required to consider alternatives to taking a proposed \naction.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii), (F) and (H); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b).  \n  14   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 35\n \n56.  Agencies  are  required  to  identify  measures  which  might  mitigate \nadverse environmental impacts, and incorporate measures necessary to mitigate \nadverse impacts into its action.  See, e.g., 23 C.F.R. §§ 771.105(e), 771.119(b).   \n57.  If  an  agency  determines  that  the  proposed  action  will  not  have \nsignificant effects, accounting for mitigation, it can issue a “Finding of No Significant \nImpact” (“FONSI”). 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.121.  If the EA reveals \nthat there may be significant effects, an environmental impact statement (“EIS”) is \nrequired.  42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(1); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(i). \nThe Administrative Procedure Act  \n58.  The Administrative Procedure Act provides that a court shall “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, and conclusions found to be,” among \nother  things  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right,” or “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) & (D). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Initial Environmental Analysis, Toll Schedule, and Pause \n59.  In 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted an expression of interest to \nFHWA seeking authorization to implement the congestion pricing program in the \nManhattan central business district.  See Exhibit 4 (Expression of Interest (June 17, \n2019)).  FHWA responded that the VPPP “appear[ed] to be the best potential fit” \namong the various federal programs that allowed tolling on Federal-aid highways.  \n  15   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 35\n \nSee  Exhibit  5  (Letter  from  Administrator  Nicole  Nason  to  Executive  Deputy \nCommissioner Ron Epstein at 1 (Oct. 24, 2019).  \n60.  A years-long environmental review process under NEPA ensued.  In \nassessing  the  congestion  pricing  program,  FHWA  specifically  considered  the \ncongestion pricing program’s purpose “to reduce traffic congestion in the [central \nbusiness district] in a manner that will generate revenue for future transportation \nimprovements,” and its specific objectives of: (1) reducing daily vehicle miles traveled \nwithin the district by at least five percent; (2) reducing the number of vehicles \nentering the district daily by at least ten percent; and (3) creating a funding source \nfor capital improvements and generating sufficient annual net revenues to fund $15 \nbillion for capital projects.12  \n61.  On March 30, 2021, while working with the Project Sponsors, then-\nActing FHWA Administrator Stephanie Pollack commended the congestion pricing \nprogram, saying “[t]he FHWA looks forward to assisting New York so we can arrive \nat a prompt and informed NEPA determination on this important and precedent-\nsetting project.”13  \n62.

In May 2023, FHWA approved the Final EA.  \n64.  On June 22, 2023, FHWA issued a “Finding of No Significant Impact” \ndetermining that the congestion pricing program, including mitigation, would not \nhave  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  and  would  not  have  a \ndisproportionately high and adverse impact on environmental justice communities or \npopulations.  \n65.  On March 27, 2024, the Triborough Board approved a toll schedule \nthrough a formal ratemaking process under New York State law.  \n66.  On  June  5,  2024,  New  York  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  announced  a \ntemporary pause of the congestion pricing program.   \n67.  On June 14, 2024, FHWA concluded that the approved toll schedule and \nassociated impacts were analyzed and mitigated appropriately under NEPA, that no \nadditional environmental analysis was warranted, and that the conclusions in the \nFinal EA and FONSI remained valid.   \n68.  On November 14, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed that the congestion \npricing program move forward with the toll schedule adopted by the Triborough \nBoard in March 2024, but to be phased in over several years, with a lower initial toll \namount to lessen the burden on drivers during early implementation (the “Phase-In \n \n15 Final EA, Table ES-3 at ES-14. \n  17   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 35\n \nApproach”).    In  November  2024,  the  Project  Sponsors  completed  a  second \nreevaluation under NEPA to assess the Phase-In Approach.   \n69.  That reevaluation confirmed that under the Phase-In Approach, the \ncongestion pricing program would still meet its purpose and need, and all of its \nobjectives. Specifically, Reevaluation 2 predicted that the Phase-In Approach with an \ninitial $9 toll would exceed a daily five percent reduction in vehicle miles traveled in \nthe central business district and a ten percent reduction in vehicles entering the \ndistrict daily and would generate sufficient annual revenues to fund MTA capital \nprojects. After phase-in of the $15 peak auto toll, the Phase-In Approach would result \nin at least 8.9 percent reduction in miles traveled, at least 17.3 percent reduction in \nvehicle entry, and at least $0.9 billion in annual revenue.  \n70.  On November 18, 2024, the Triborough Board formally adopted the \nPhase-In Approach. \n71.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA concluded that the impacts of the Phase- \nwere analyzed and mitigated accordingly, that the conclusions in FHWA’s Final EA \nand FONSI remained valid, and that no additional environmental analysis was \nwarranted.   \nThe Cooperative Agreement  \n \n72.  That same day, on November 21, 2024, FHWA and the Project Sponsors \nsigned the cooperative agreement.  \n73.  The cooperative agreement states in relevant part that “[e]ffective on \nthe  date  of  this  Agreement,  the  project  is  approved  as  a  pilot  program,”  and \n  18   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 35\n \nTriborough is authorized to “operate the Project as a toll Project in accordance with \nthe provisions of this Agreement and as a value pricing project, as part of State DOT’s \nvalue pricing pilot program.”  Exhibit 2, cl. 1. \n74.    FHWA  further  agreed  that  “the  imposition  of  tolls  under  this \nAgreement does not render Federal-aid highways within the State of New York \ngenerally  ineligible  for  Federal-aid  highway  funds  where  such  highways  are \notherwise eligible under the particular funding program.”  Id. cl. 5.   \n75.  In return, the Project Sponsors agreed to a number of obligations in the \ncooperative agreement, including: (1) “to adequately maintain” federal-aid highways \nlocated in the geographic area of the congestion pricing program, id. cl. 6; (2) to submit \nregular reports on the effects of the congestion pricing program “on driver behavior, \ntraffic volume, congestion, transit ridership” and other topics to FHWA, id. cl. 8(b); \nand (3) “to comply with all Federal laws and requirements applicable to this project, \nincluding the laws and policies applicable to the [VPPP],” id. cl. 9.  Clause 8 of the \ncooperative agreement further requires that the Project Sponsors “identify benefits \nthe application of tolls has in reducing climate pollution” and “demonstrate the \nbenefits mitigation measures provide to underserved communities.”  Id. cl. 8. \n76.  In addition, the cooperative agreement requires that FHWA and the \nProject  Sponsors  to  “cooperate  and  work  together  in  the  implementation  of  the \nProject.”  Id. cl. 8(a). \n77.  The cooperative agreement does not include any provision authorizing \nFHWA to terminate the agreement.  Rather, it contemplates that only Triborough \n  19   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 20 of 35\n \ncould unilaterally decide to discontinue the congestion pricing program, requiring the \nProject Sponsors to “work with FHWA to return the Project to its original operating \ncondition if [Triborough] decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id. cl. 11.  \n78.  The cooperative agreement references FHWA regulations at 23 C.F.R. \nParts 940 and 950.  Id. cl. 9.  These regulations do not grant FHWA authority to \nunilaterally terminate the cooperative agreement. \nImplementation of the Congestion Pricing Program \n79.  In late 2024, several groups, individuals, and counties, as well as the \nState of New Jersey, sought preliminary injunctive relief barring the MTA and \nTriborough from beginning the congestion pricing program or collecting tolls on \nvarious federal and state constitutional and statutory grounds.  Each of these claims \nfor injunctive relief was rejected by the courts.  See Chan v. U.S. Dept. of Transp., No. \n23 Civ. 10365 (LJL), 2024 WL 5199945 (S.D.N.Y.

On January 5, 2025, the congestion pricing program went into effect.  \nEligible vehicles entering the central business district are being tolled at the rates \nestablished in the Phase-In Approach. \n81.  MTA data showed that crossing times were significantly faster at the \nLincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel in January 2025, compared to January \n2024.16  Trips on the Williamsburg Bridge and Queensboro Bridge have also been \nsignificantly faster and riders on express buses are saving time on their commutes.17  \n82.  Data collected by the MTA reveals that since the congestion pricing \nprogram began, traffic in the central business district decreased substantially, with \n1.2 million fewer vehicles entering the district than projected.  Drivers in the district \nare  experiencing  travel  time  improvements  in  the  afternoon  peak  hours  “with \nreductions as high as 59%.”18  Inbound river crossings to the central business district \nhave seen a 10%-48% decrease in travel times, and several bus routes have seen \nsignificant decreases in the time needed to complete their routes.19  After a brief rise \nin January, daily average traffic volumes have dropped on the bridges that do not \n \n16 Andrew Siff, MTA Calls Congestion Pricing ‘Transformative” on Commutes, NBC NEW YORK, (Jan. \n29, 2025), https://www.nbcnewyork.com/new-york-city/mta-congestion-pricing-transformative-\ncommute-impact/6126670/.  \n17 Id. \n18 See New Congestion Relief Zone Data Captures Magnitude of Faster Commutes for Drivers and Bus \nRiders, Fewer Vehicles and Surging Express Bus Ridership, MTA (Jan. 29, 2025), \nhttps://www.mta.info/press-release/new-congestion-relief-zone-data-captures-magnitude-of-faster-\ncommutes-drivers-and-bus. \n19 Id. \n  21   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 22 of 35\n \nconnect directly to the central business district, indicating that the toll has not \ndiverted traffic.20 \n83.  The congestion pricing program has not stymied economic activity.  Data \nprovided  by  the  MTA  shows  that  in  January  2025,  35.8  million  people  visited \nBusiness Improvement Districts within the central business district, a 1.5 million \nincrease compared to last January.21 \n84.  The Partnership for New York City’s President & CEO Kathryn Wylde \nhas stated that, since the onset of Congestion Pricing, New Yorkers are “moving \nfaster and there’s less traffic,”22 and that “[i]n every respect, this is a policy that \nPresident Trump and the Republicans should be supporting.”23 \n85.  Emergency  vehicle  speeds  have  also  improved.    For  many  years, \nincreasing traffic in New York City led to longer and longer emergency vehicle \nresponse times.  As documented in a report issued by State Senator Brad Hoylman-\nSigal, who represents much of the district, and traffic engineer Sam Schwartz, over \nthe past decade, “E.M.S. response times to life-threatening situations had increased \nby 29%; for Fire Department vehicles tending to medical emergencies, the lag was up \n \n20 Dave Colon, Data: Congestion Pricing is Not Rerouting Traffic to Other Boroughs, STREETSBLOG \nNYC (Mar. 12, 2025) https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/12/data-outer-borough-congestion-pricing-\nspillover-traffic-not-happening.  \n21 Arun Venugopal, Vehicle traffic is down in Manhattan, but pedestrian traffic is up, data says, \nGOTHAMIST  (Feb. 13, 2025) https://gothamist.com/news/vehicle-traffic-is-down-in-manhattan-but-\npedestrian-traffic-is-up-data-says  \n22 Dick Brennan, President Trump said to have NYC's congestion pricing, bike lanes in his crosshairs, \nCBS NEWS (Feb. 10, 2025), https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/president-trump-nyc-congestion-\npricing-bike-lanes/.  \n23 Ry Rivard & Nick Reisman, New York’s business boosters push Trump to keep Manhattan tolls, \nPOLITICO (Feb. 11, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/new-york-trump-congestion-\npricing-00203540.  \n  22   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 23 of 35\n \nby 72 percent.”24  The preliminary data indicates that emergency vehicles have \nbenefited from the reduction in congestion and are able to respond more quickly to \ncalls.25 \n86.  Reports also indicate that the congestion pricing program has made the \nstreets safer, with data gathered by Streetsblog NYC indicating a striking 51% drop \nin crash-related injuries in the congestion pricing program’s first 12 days as compared \nto the same time period in 2024.26  Thirty-seven people were injured in 90 total \nreported crashes, down from 76 injuries in 199 crashes in the same 12-day period in \n2024.  \n87.

In  his  Presidential  campaign,  Donald  Trump  repeatedly  voiced  his \npolitical opposition to the congestion pricing program and stated that he would \n“terminate” and “kill” the congestion pricing program once in office. \n90.  Following  the  election,  President  Trump  continued  to  express  his \nopposition  to  the  Program,  saying  in  an  interview  with  the  New  York  Post  on \nNovember 14, 2024, that he “strongly disagree[d] with the decision on the congestion \ntax.”29 \nUnlawful Termination of the Cooperative agreement \n \n91.  On February 19, 2025, Secretary Duffy notified Kathy Hochul, Governor \nof New York State, that he was rescinding defendant FHWA’s approval of congestion \npricing in the central business district and terminating the cooperative agreement.  \nSee Exhibit 1.  Although the Secretary stated that he was terminating the agreement \nbecause FHWA had lacked authority to enter into it under ISTEA, the Secretary also \nindicated  that  the  termination  was  motivated  by  the  President’s  opposition  to \ncongestion pricing as well the Secretary’s own policy disagreement with New York \nState.

The Secretary asserted that the congestion pricing program was “not an \neligible [cooperative agreement]” for two reasons: (1) the program creates “cordon \npricing,” meaning that there is not a toll-free means to enter the central business \ndistrict; and (2) the toll rate was “primarily” calculated to raise revenue for MTA \ncapital projects, as opposed to reducing congestion.  Id. at 3. \n93.  The Secretary did not provide any explanation of the grounds for the \nreversal of FHWA’s earlier determination that the congestion pricing program was \neligible for the VPPP or FHWA’s publicly available guidance that cordon pricing is \npermitted under VPPP, and that revenues from VPPP programs may be used to \nsupport public transit.  \n94.  Defendants did not give State DOT, NYCDOT, or Triborough notice or \nan opportunity to be heard nor did it conduct any environmental review under NEPA \nbefore terminating the cooperative agreement.  \n95.  On February 20, 2025, Executive Director Shepherd notified State DOT, \nNYCDOT, and Triborough that, pursuant to Secretary Duffy’s February 19 letter, \n“[State DOT] and its project sponsors must cease the collection of tolls on Federal-aid \nhighways in the [central business district] by March 21, 2025.”  Exhibit 3 at 1.  The \nProject Sponsors are State DOT, NYCDOT, and Triborough. \nThe Harms to New York State  \nfrom Ending the Congestion Pricing Program \n \n96.  New  York  State’s  sovereign  and  quasi-sovereign  interests  will  be \nharmed if congestion pricing is halted.  \n  25   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 26 of 35\n \n97.  New  York  State  has  an  interest  in  ensuring  that  the  cooperative \nagreement authorizing congestion pricing to which State DOT, as an authorized \nparticipant in the VPPP, was a signatory remains in effect. \n98.  New York State’s sovereign interest in the implementation of the Act \nwill be harmed if tolling revenues are halted. \n99.  For several reasons, New York State’s quasi-sovereign interest in the \nhealth and welfare of its residents will be harmed if tolling revenues are halted.  \n100.  New York’s economy, and to a significant degree the nation’s economy, \ndepends on keeping vehicle traffic in the New York City metropolitan area moving.   \n101.  Critical parts of the MTA capital program would be delayed if program \ntolling  revenues  are  halted.    The  program  includes:  (1)  adding  accessibility \nimprovements (including elevators) to numerous subway stations consistent with the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act,  by  making  at  least  70  more  subway  systems \naccessible through building new elevators at 70 stations in all of the boroughs and \nreplacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators, and finally bring the transportation \nsystem to greater than 50% accessibility; (2) doubling the number of track lines with \nmodernized signals; (3) purchasing over 1,900 new rail cars, which are six times more \nreliable than older ones, and replacing 2,400 buses; (4) replacing approximately 60 \nmiles of track; and (5) renewing stations and addressing important repair projects at \n175 stations.  \n102.  The congestion pricing program will also provide funding for much-\nneeded repairs to Grand Central Terminal, a more than 100-year-old structure that \n  26   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 27 of 35\n \nis used by more than 700 trains a day.  And coupled with funding from the 2015-2019 \nprogram, the MTA Capital Program further provides funding for three new fully \naccessible stations on the Second Avenue Subway that would allow connection to the \nMetro-North lines, strengthening connections for Harlem and East Harlem residents.  \n103.  New Yorkers, through the MTA Capital Program, will also receive better \naccess to Penn Station through a new route with four new stations on the Metro-\nNorth New Haven Line that will carry up to 50,000 Metro-North customers directly \nto Penn Station every day.  \n104.  Finally, ending the congestion pricing program means the unabated \ncontinuation of the severe congestion in Manhattan’s central business district, with \nits  concomitant  economic,  environmental,  and  public  health  and  safety  costs  to \nbusinesses, residents, commuters, workers, and visitors in this area, without any \nevaluation  of  these  and  other  environmental  impacts,  opportunity  for  public \nparticipation, or consideration of alternatives required by NEPA.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM  \n \nTermination of the Cooperative Agreement \nNot in Accordance with Law and In Excess of Statutory Authority  \nIn Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n \n105.  The State realleges all of the preceding paragraphs.   \n106.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that the court finds to be, among other things, “not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, \nor short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) & (C). \n  27   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 28 of 35\n \n107.  Neither ISTEA nor the cooperative agreement authorizes FHWA to \nunilaterally rescind the cooperative agreement or to rescind FHWA’s approval of the \ncongestion pricing program.   \n108.  Under  2  C.F.R.  §  200.340(a),  a  cooperative  agreement  may  be \nterminated by an agency only if the recipient has failed to comply with the agreement, \nif the recipient consents, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  \n109.  None of those conditions required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a) are present \nhere. \n110.  Defendants unilaterally terminated the cooperative agreement without \nauthority. \n111.  Executive Director Shepherd’s directive that State DOT, NYCDOT, and \nTriborough cease the collection of tolls by March 21, 2025, was based on the unlawful \ntermination of the cooperative agreement and thus was also without authority.  \n112.  Defendants’ unlawful termination of the cooperative agreement and \nExecutive Director Shepherd’s directive were not in accordance with law and were in \nexcess of authority.  As a result, the termination and directive are null and void and \nshould be declared unlawful and set aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (C).  \nSECOND CLAIM  \n \nTermination of the Cooperative Agreement \nUltra Vires  \n \n113.  The State realleges all of the preceding paragraphs.  \n  28   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 29 of 35\n \n114.  A court must set aside an ultra vires act by a federal official.  \n115.  Defendants’ unlawful termination of the cooperative agreement was \nultra vires. \n116.  Executive Director Shepherd’s directive that State DOT, NYCDOT, and \nTriborough  cease  the  collection  of  tolls  by  March  21,  2025,  was  based  on  the \nSecretary’s unlawful termination of the cooperative agreement and thus was also \nultra vires.  \n117.  The termination of the cooperative agreement and Executive Director \nShepherd’s directive are null and void and should be declared unlawful and set aside. \nTHIRD CLAIM  \n \nTermination of the Cooperative Agreement \nNot in Accordance with Law and  \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required by Law \nIn Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n \n118.  The State realleges all of the preceding paragraphs.   \n119.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that the court finds to be, among other things, “not in \naccordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) & (D). \n120.  The Uniform Guidance provides that, before an agency may terminate \nan award, including a cooperative agreement, the agency must provide written notice \nand an opportunity to be heard.  2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341(a), 342. \n121.  Defendants terminated the cooperative agreement without giving the \nState written notice and an opportunity to be heard before the termination. \n  29   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 30 of 35\n \n122.  Executive Director Shepherd’s directive that State DOT, NYCDOT, and \nTriborough  cease  the  collection  of  tolls  by  March  21,  2025,  was  based  on  the \ntermination of the cooperative agreement.  \n123.  Defendants’ termination of the cooperative agreement and Executive \nDirector Shepherd’s directive were without observance of procedure required by law \nand thus were also not in accordance with law.  As a result, the termination and \ndirective are null and void and should be declared unlawful and set aside under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (C).  \nFOURTH CLAIM  \n \nTermination of the Cooperative Agreement \nNot in Accordance with Law \nIn Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n \n124.  The State realleges all of the preceding paragraphs. \n125.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that the court finds to be, among other things, “arbitrary \nand capricious” or “otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n126.  Secretary Duffy terminated the cooperative agreement on the ground \nthat the congestion pricing program was not eligible for the VPPP.  \n127.  An agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency fails to \nprovide a rationale for reversal of a prior determination.  \n128.  Secretary Duffy did not provide any rationale for reversal of FHWA’s \nprior termination that the congestion pricing program was eligible for the VPPP.   \n  30   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 31 of 35\n \n129.  Defendants’ termination of the cooperative agreement on the ground \nthat the congestion pricing program was not eligible for the VPPP was arbitrary and \ncapricious. \n130.  Secretary Duffy contended that the congestion pricing program was not \neligible for the VPP because the VPPP does not allow cordon pricing and does not \nallow a congestion pricing program where tolls are primarily calculated to raise \nrevenue for MTA capital projects rather than to reduce congestion or meet other road-\nrelated goals.  \n131.  The VPPP allows cordon pricing.  \n132.  The tolls established by the congestion pricing program are calculated \nto reduce congestion as well as raise revenue for MTA capital projects.  The VPPP \ndoes not limit the factors that States can consider in calculating tolls and allows \nStates to use toll revenue for non-road projects, including public transit.  \n133.  Defendants’ termination of the cooperative agreement on the grounds \nthat the VPPP does not allow cordon pricing and the use of toll revenue for non-road \nprojects was not in accordance with law. \n134.  Executive Director Shepherd’s directive that State DOT, NYCDOT, and \nTriborough cease the collection of tolls by March 21, 2025, was based on the unlawful \ntermination of the cooperative agreement and thus was also arbitrary and capricious \nand not in accordance with law.  \n135.  Defendants’ termination of the cooperative agreement and Executive \nDirector Shepherd’s directive were arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance \n  31   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 32 of 35\n \nwith law and are therefore null and void and should be held unlawful and set aside \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nFIFTH CLAIM  \n \nTermination of the Cooperative Agreement \nIn Violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and  \nNot in Accordance with Law and  \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required by Law \nIn Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n \n136.  The State realleges all of the preceding paragraphs.   \n137.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that the court finds to be, among other things, “not in \naccordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) & (D). \n138.  NEPA  requires  federal  agencies  to  prepare  an  EIS  for  any  “major \nFederal action[] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).   \n139.  Agencies are required to take a hard look at the reasonably foreseeable \nsocial, economic, and environmental impacts of a proposed action and its alternatives.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 4336; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b); Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983).  \n140.  Agencies are required to consider alternatives to taking a proposed \naction.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii), (F) and (H); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b).  \n141.  Agencies  are  required  to  identify  measures  which  might  mitigate \nadverse  environmental  impacts  and  incorporate  measures  necessary  to  mitigate \n  32   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 33 of 35\n \nadverse impacts into its action terminating the cooperative agreement.  See, e.g., 23 \nC.F.R. §§ 771.105(e), 771.119(b).   \n142.  To determine whether a major federal action will have a significant \neffect on “the quality of the human environment,” agencies may prepare an EA.

If  an  agency  determines  that  the  proposed  action  will  not  have \nsignificant effects, accounting for mitigation, it can issue a FONSI. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.121.  If the EA reveals that there may be significant \neffects, an EIS is required.   \n144.  Defendants’  purported  termination  of  the  cooperative  agreement \nconstitutes a major federal action within the meaning of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4332(C), \n4336e(10), as was the decision to approve the congestion pricing program and sign \nthe agreement. \n145.  Defendants did not prepare an EA and FONSI, or EIS, regarding the \ntermination of the cooperative agreement.  \n146.  As result, defendants failed to consider the full extent of the reasonably \nforeseeable impacts of terminating the cooperative agreement, which will provide \nsubstantial benefits to the central business district and the region in terms of reduced \ntraffic and congestion, improved air quality, and concomitant environmental, public \nhealth, and economic benefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that occurred \nfollowing the implementation of the congestion pricing program.   \n  33   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 37     Filed 03/27/25     Page 34 of 35\n \n147.  Defendants  also  failed  to  consider  alternatives  to  terminating  the \ncooperative agreement and mitigation measures. \n148.  Defendants’ termination of the cooperative agreement violated NEPA. \n149.  Executive Director Shepherd’s directive that State DOT, NYCDOT, and \nTriborough cease the collection of tolls by March 21, 2025, was based on the unlawful \ntermination of the cooperative agreement and thus also violated NEPA.  \n150.  Defendants’ termination of the cooperative agreement and Executive \nDirector Shepherd’s directive were not in accordance with law and not in observance \nof procedure required by law and are therefore null and void and should be held \nunlawful and set aside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (D). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the State respectfully requests that the Court:  \ni.

On January 5, 2025, the State of New York embarked on a bold new program to \nreduce traffic congestion in the New York City metropolitan area and fund and promote public \ntransit with the Central Business District (“CBD”) Tolling Program (“Program”).  The Program, \nalso known as Congestion Pricing, is a market-based, user-pay solution that has seen success in \nmajor cities around the world and was first conceived of right here in New York City as a possible \nsolution to Manhattan’s longstanding congestion woes.   \n2.  New York Decides to Implement the Program.  For many years, the CBD was one \nof the most congested urban areas in the country.  Travel times were extraordinarily slow.  Indeed, \nthe term “gridlock” was invented in Manhattan.  Congestion in the CBD has been a $20 billion \nannual drag on the regional economy, and thus the national economy as well.   \n3.  In the 1950s, Nobel laureate and Columbia University economist William S. \nVickrey proposed a market-based solution to the congestion affecting the City: charging vehicles \nto drive in highly congested areas.  Over the following decades, New York state and local officials, \npolicy experts, and advocacy groups studied various solutions to identify the most effective way \nto reduce congestion, which results in lost productivity, poor air quality, slower and less reliable \npublic bus service, delayed emergency response times, and reduced public safety, among other \nharmful conditions.  That extensive deliberation led to the consensus that congestion pricing is the \nmost effective tool to achieve that goal—a consensus supported by the experience of London, \nSingapore, Stockholm, and Milan, which have each implemented their own congestion pricing \nprograms and have seen as a result significant decreases in vehicle congestion and corresponding \nincreases in the use of public transit facilities like subways and buses. \n4.  In April 2019, following multiple attempts by New York elected officials to \nimplement a form of congestion pricing, the New York Legislature and then-Governor Andrew \n  2   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 3 of 111\n \nCuomo passed the Traffic Mobility Act (“TMA”), a landmark statute with the goal of reducing \ntraffic congestion in the CBD and creating a dedicated funding source for the MTA’s capital needs.  \nN.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 1701 et seq.  The TMA authorized and directed TBTA, the MTA’s \nindependent affiliate, to establish and operate a congestion pricing program, including tolling of \neligible vehicles entering or remaining in the CBD, and earmarked the revenues from the Program \nfor the MTA’s 2020-2024 Capital Program (the “Capital Program”) and subsequent capital \nprograms. \n5.  Shortly after the TMA was enacted, in the spring of 2019, New York State, through \nNYSDOT, TBTA, and NYCDOT (collectively, the “Project Sponsors”), attended several meetings \nwith representatives from the first Trump Administration’s FHWA and USDOT to discuss and \npresent the proposed program.  During those meetings, the Project Sponsors explained that the \nProgram would accomplish its aims by tolling eligible vehicles entering the CBD in order to \nincentivize the use of modes other than driving, and using those tolling revenues to improve the \nmetropolitan region’s public transportation infrastructure, thereby further encouraging the use of \npublic transit.   \n6.  The Federal Defendants Authorize the Program Under the Value Pricing Pilot \nProgram.  Early on, FHWA and USDOT took the position that the “best fit” for the Program would \nbe for the Project Sponsors to apply for federal tolling authorization through the Value Pricing \nPilot Program, a statutory provision under which FHWA may authorize congestion pricing on \nfederal-aid highways to reduce roadway congestion and improve air quality.  See 23 U.S.C. § 149 \nnote (Value Pricing Pilot Program) (“VPPP”).1  The VPPP, originally called the Congestion \n \n1 A “federal-aid highway” is a “public highway eligible for assistance” under provisions of Chapter 1, Title 23 of the \nUnited States Code, “other than a highway functionally classified as a local road or rural minor collector.”  23 U.S.C. \n§ 101(a)(6). \n  3   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 4 of 111\n \nPricing Pilot Program, has been used across the country to authorize tolling to reduce congestion, \nimprove the environment, and raise funding for public transit.  It has specifically been used in Fort \nMyers, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to finance and study congestion pricing in urban areas \nthrough the establishment of tolls to enter an area, similar to the programs that exist in London, \nSingapore, Stockholm, and Milan.  Indeed, this type of tolling, known as “cordon pricing” (or \nsometimes “zone-based pricing” or “area-wide pricing”), has consistently been recognized, in \nCongress and by USDOT and FHWA, as the model form of “congestion pricing” authorized under \nthe VPPP because it most effectively reduces overall congestion within a geographic area.   \n7.  In June 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted an Expression of Interest (“EoI”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit A, to FHWA for authority to assess tolls on vehicles entering the CBD.  \nThe EoI reiterated that the “purpose of [the Program] is to reduce the high level of traffic \ncongestion in the CBD,” and anticipated that “a variable toll to access the CBD, combined with an \ninvestment of the resultant revenues in improving public transit alternatives, will maximize the \ncongestion reduction in the CBD and the surrounding area.”  EoI at 1-2. \n8.  Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 \net seq., FHWA proceeded to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Program.  This \nincluded, as directed by a former Executive Order that has since been revoked by President Trump, \nthe Program’s potential to have a disproportionately high and adverse impact on minority and low-\nincome (i.e., environmental justice [“EJ”]) populations including EJ communities that have pre-\nexisting pollution and health burdens due to historic transportation and land use decisions.  After \na multi-year environmental review process from 2019 through 2024 that yielded an administrative \nrecord of more than 45,000 pages, FHWA and the Project Sponsors prepared a 958-page Final \nEnvironmental  Assessment  (“Final  EA”)  followed  by  a  Finding  of  No  Significant  Impact \n  4   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 5 of 111\n \n(“FONSI”)  and  two  Reevaluations,  which  determined  that  the  Program  would  not  have  a \nsignificant adverse impact on the environment or a disproportionately high and adverse impact on \nEJ communities in light of, among other things, (1) the anticipated reduction of overall vehicle \nmiles traveled (“VMT”) and vehicular emissions in the region, and (2) the Project Sponsors’ \ncommitment to a robust, $155 million mitigation package to improve air quality and public health \nin EJ communities that have pre-existing pollution and health burdens and could experience traffic \ndiversions as a result of the Program.   \n9.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA executed an agreement with the Project Sponsors \n(the “VPPP Agreement” or “VPPP Agmt.”), attached hereto as Exhibit B, pursuant to which \nFHWA approved the Program’s collection of tolls under the VPPP and required (among other \nthings) implementation of the Project Sponsors’ mitigation commitments.  Consistent with the \nVPPP, the VPPP Agreement recognizes that toll revenues may be used on any project eligible for \nfederal assistance, which includes public transit.  The VPPP Agreement also requires the Project \nSponsors to provide data on project performance (i.e., reduction of congestion and increased use \nof public transit) for “at least ten years.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 8(b). \n10.  The VPPP Agreement does not provide any right to the federal government to \nterminate the Program; rather, the VPPP Agreement provides only that the parties agree to “return \nthe Project to its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  \nId., cl. 11 (emphasis added). \n11.  The Program Is Succeeding.  The Program went into effect on January 5, 2025, and \nvehicles entering the CBD are being tolled in accordance with the toll rate schedule regulation \nadopted by the TBTA Board and authorized in the VPPP Agreement.  Already, the data collected \nto date (and simply looking at the roads) show that there is less congestion and the Program is \n  5   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 6 of 111\n \nworking: vehicle entries to the CBD and commute times have fallen; vehicle speeds—including \nthose of public buses—have increased; more people are visiting Manhattan’s commercial districts \nand supporting the region’s businesses; and the MTA’s mass transit system is seeing the benefit \nof increased ridership and increased funding.   \n12.  A recent study by researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research \n(“NBER”),  Google  Research,  Yale  University,  and  Stanford  University  found  that  the \n“introduction of congestion pricing led to an immediate increase in speeds within NYC’s CBD, \nwhich has persisted since implementation,” and estimated “that speeds in NYC’s CBD increased \nby 15%” on average and that the “effects on speeds are even larger during the afternoon—\nhistorically the most congested time of day—and persist even after peak-hours pricing ends at \n9pm.”2  Traffic in the CBD has decreased substantially, with approximately 5.8 million fewer \nvehicles entering the district in January through March 2025 than would be expected based on data \nfor prior years, representing a 12.5% reduction overall across the first three months of the \nProgram.3  The data also indicates a 10% reduction in VMT by all vehicles in the CBD from \nJanuary to mid-March of 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024.  \n13.  According to data collected by TRANSCOM, a coalition of 16 transportation and \npublic safety agencies in the broader metropolitan region, crossing times were 17% faster at the \nLincoln Tunnel and 48% faster at the Holland Tunnel in January 2025, compared to January 2024; \ntrip times from Brooklyn and Queens to the CBD have dropped between 10% and 30%; and \nexpress buses save about 10 minutes on their commutes.  Traffic speeds on river crossings have \n \n2 Cody Cook, et al., The Short-Run Effects of Congestion Pricing in New York City, NBER (March 17, 2025), \nhttps://shoshanavasserman.com/files/2025/03/NYC_Congestion_Pricing_2025.pdf (last accessed April 14, 2025). \n3 MTA, MTA Metrics: Vehicle Reductions, https://metrics.mta.info/?cbdtp/vehiclereductions (last accessed April 14, \n2025).   \n  6   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 7 of 111\n \nbeen 5% to 30% faster this February than last February.  Traffic speeds on major bridges improved \nsignificantly: on the Queensboro Bridge, by 31%; on the Brooklyn Bridge, by 26%; and on the \nManhattan Bridge, by 7%.4  These trends continued in March: fewer vehicles utilized the nine \nMTA bridges and tunnels, with levels dropping 2.4% from March of 2024 to March of 2025.5  The \nlargest reductions are at the Hugh L. Carey and Queens-Midtown Tunnels, which lead directly into \nthe CBD.  Truck traffic traveling through these tunnels dropped 14% this year compared to the \nsame period in 2024.6   \n14.  Honking is also down, as New Yorkers in the CBD are finally enjoying what might \nbe called some “peace and quiet” since the Program went into effect, corresponding to a 69% \ndecline in noise complaints about honking made to the City’s 311 portal.7   \n15.  The dire projections that the Program would harm business are also belied by the \ndata.  Credit card sales data reflect that retail sales in the CBD are on track to be $900 million \nhigher in 2025 compared to the same period last year.8  Crain’s New York Business reports that \nmore people visited the Business Improvement Districts (“BIDs”) within the CBD in January 2025 \nthan during the same month last year, noting a 4.6% year-over-year increase in visitation.9  Indeed, \n \n4 MTA, January 2025 MTA Board Meeting, Congestion Relief Zone Tolling January 29, 2025 Update 9, \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/163411 (last accessed Apr. 17, 2025); February 2025 MTA Board Presentation at \n10 (Feb. 26, 2025), https://www.mta.info/document/165401 (last accessed Apr. 17, 2025). \n5 MTA Daily Ridership and Traffic: Beginning 2020, Data.NY.Gov (Apr. 16, 2025), \nhttps://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-and-Traffic-Beginning-2020/sayj-mze2/about_data.  \n6 Samuel Schwartz, Where Have all the Trucks Gone?

Business leaders have voiced their support for the Program, recognizing the \nbenefits of Congestion Pricing for businesses in the CBD and the broader economy.  Greater New \nYork Chamber of Commerce CEO Mark Jaffe has stated that the Program “will improve the \nquality of life in Manhattan for all who live, work and visit,” and that decreased traffic from the \nProgram “should decrease labor time and improve the efficiencies of getting essential commodities \nonto the shelves.”12  The Partnership for New York City, a non-profit group of New York business \nleaders, has likewise voiced its support for the Program, pointing out that it could save “an \nestimated $20 billion that excess congestion costs annually because of more efficient and timely \nmovement of people and goods, which will increase productivity and reduce expenditures on fuel \nand overtime.”13  More recently, the Partnership for New York City’s President & CEO Kathryn \nWylde stated that, “[i]n every respect, this is a policy that President Trump and the Republicans \nshould be supporting.”14 \n \n10 Arun Venugopal, Vehicle Traffic is Down in Manhattan, But Pedestrian Traffic Is Up, Data Says, GOTHAMIST (Feb. \n13, 2025), https://gothamist.com/news/vehicle-traffic-is-down-in-manhattan-but-pedestrian-traffic-is-up-data-says. \n11  Research  &  Statistics,  Grosses-Broadway  in  NYC,  THE  BROADWAY  LEAGUE \nhttps://www.broadwayleague.com/research/grosses-broadway-nyc/ (last accessed Apr. 17, 2025).Gersh Kuntzman, \nWind in Their Sales: Congestion Pricing Is No ‘Toll’ on the Broadway Box Office, STREETSBLOG NYC (Feb. 5, 2025), \nhttps://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/05/wind-in-their-sales-congestion-pricing-is-no-toll-on-the-broadway-box-office. \n12 New York’s Chamber (@NYChamber), X (Nov. 15, 2024, 3:29 PM), \nhttps://x.com/NYChamber/status/1857521387583451602.  \n13 Louisa Chafee, et al., Op-ed: Congestion Pricing Will Be a Boon for New York, PFNYC.ORG (Nov. 14, 2014), \nhttps://pfnyc.org/news/op-ed-congestion-pricing-will-be-a-boon-for-new-york/.  \n14 Ry Rivard & Nick Reisman, New York’s Business Boosters Push Trump to Keep Manhattan Tolls, POLITICO (Feb. \n11, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/new-york-trump-congestion-pricing-00203540.  \n  8   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 9 of 111\n \n17.  The  region’s  subways,  buses,  and  commuter  railroads—vital  transportation \nlifelines for so many New Yorkers who live in the metropolitan area and beyond—are already \nbenefiting from substantial investments that have been made as a result of the Program.  In \nparticular, key tenets of the Capital Program include improving outdated signaling and other \nequipment  to  increase  system  reliability;  improving  safety  and  customer  service  through \ntechnology; and extending public transit to underserved areas.  And the Program will create many \nmore benefits going forward.  For example, Program revenue will be used to update and renovate \nnumerous subway stations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act by building new \nelevators at 70 stations across the boroughs and replacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators, \nbringing the transportation system to greater than 50% accessibility.   \n18.  In addition, Program revenue will be used to advance the $155 million package of \nmitigation for EJ communities, which is designed to address preexisting pollution and chronic \nhealth burdens.  These measures will include replacing diesel engines with cleaner technology; \ninstalling electric charging infrastructure for trucks; planting roadside vegetation to improve near-\nroad air quality; and installing air filtration units in schools near highways.   \n19.  TBTA has also issued debt that is supported by revenues generated by the Program \nand by long-term bonds issued partly in reliance on revenues generated by the Program.  This \nincludes no less than $378.8 million in short-term notes currently outstanding to fund infrastructure \ncosts, and $500 million in short-term notes to fund a portion of the $15 billion of capital projects \nin the Capital Program.  By the end of the month, TBTA also expects to close a $500 million bank \nloan to support the Capital Program, relying on Program revenues as security. \n  9   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 10 of 111\n \n20.  New Yorkers support the Program because it is working.  According to a poll \nreported by CBS News, the majority of New Yorkers want the Program to continue.15  On a 2-to-\n1 basis, New Yorkers say that the Program is working.16  The Program’s biggest supporters are the \nindividuals who actually drive into the CBD frequently.17  Ultimately, 6 out of every 10 New \nYorkers say that President Trump should not take any steps to end the Program.18 \n21.  The New Administration Seeks to “Terminate” the Program.  Notwithstanding the \nextensive evaluations—and now results—showing that Congestion Pricing is the best way to \nreduce congestion in the CBD, reduce overall vehicle emissions in the greater region, and improve \nthe accessibility and reliability of public transit, the Program has continued to have its political \ndetractors, including the President of the United States.  As early as May 2024, President Trump \nposted on “Truth Social” that he would “TERMINATE Congestion Pricing in my FIRST WEEK \nback in Office,” and subsequent media reports—from the President and his allies in Congress—\nindicated that the Administration wished to immediately and summarily end Congestion Pricing \nto achieve political objectives.   \n22.  On  February  19,  2025,  the  Trump  Administration  attempted  to  do  just  that.  \nDefendant USDOT Secretary Duffy issued a letter to Governor Hochul, attached hereto as \nExhibit C (the “Duffy Letter” or “Duffy Ltr.”), purporting to “rescind” the VPPP Agreement and \n“terminate” the Program.

Despite the Administration’s “royal” decree, its effort to summarily and unilaterally \noverturn the solution to the City’s congestion enacted by New Yorkers’ elected representatives is \nunlawful and invalid.  Accordingly, Congestion Pricing remains alive and well, and the MTA and \nTBTA responded by filing this lawsuit seeking a declaration that the Administration’s actions are \nnull and void and for vacatur of the purported “rescission” and “termination.”  NYSDOT and \nNYCDOT then successfully moved to intervene as plaintiffs in this lawsuit, and now join in this \nfirst amended consolidated complaint.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club also successfully moved \nto intervene as plaintiffs in this lawsuit and filed their own complaint on March 8, 2025.  ECF 41. \n24.  Neither the VPPP Agreement nor applicable law or regulations permit Defendants \nto unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement.  This makes good sense.  If Defendants had some \nabsolute right to unilaterally terminate a VPPP program that had already been approved and \n  11   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 12 of 111\n \nimplemented, it would create uncertainty around the future of such programs any time leadership \nat FHWA, USDOT, or the White House changed—uncertainty that would obviously undermine \nthe purposes of the VPPP, make it difficult to issue bonds for other projects, and be inimical to a \nrules-based, market economy.   \n25.  Beyond  that,  the  two  legal  rationales  for  attempting  to  terminate  the  VPPP \nAgreement in Duffy’s February 19 letter are so weak as to be transparently pretextual.  First, Duffy \nclaimed that the VPPP does not authorize cordon pricing.  But the reality is that the VPPP’s broad \nlanguage authorizes a variety of congestion pricing strategies, including cordon pricing, and \nDuffy’s tortured reading is contrary to: (i) the ordinary meaning of “congestion pricing” at the time \nthat the VPPP was enacted (and each time it has subsequently been reauthorized), (ii) the statute’s \nlegislative history, and (iii) more recent pronouncements from Congress.  It is also contradicted by \nFHWA’s own official guidance documents and reports and FHWA’s approval of other cordon-\nbased pilot projects.   \n26.  Duffy’s second reason seems to relate to his factually incorrect claim that the toll \nrate schedule regulation associated with the Program is “driven primarily by the need to raise \nrevenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) system.”  Even if that were the case, \nwhich it is not, it is perfectly clear from the statutory text, the legislative history, and the agency’s \nguidance and actions that States may, and are actually expected to, consider revenue objectives \nwhen setting toll rates for projects authorized under the VPPP.  Indeed, Congress expressly stated \nthat States would use toll revenues to fund other “projects eligible under such title,” VPPP, cl. 3—\nwhich include transit capital projects—and directed the Secretary to report on the effects that VPPP \nprojects have on not only congestion but also “transit ridership … and availability of funds for \ntransportation  programs,”  id.  at  cl.  5.    In  a  different  section  of  the  Intermodal  Surface \n  12   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 13 of 111\n \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-240 (Dec. 18, 1991) (“ISTEA”), the statute \nthat  created  the  VPPP,  Congress  even  required  States  to  consider  “the  use  of  innovative \nmechanisms for financing [transportation] projects, including ... congestion pricing,” ISTEA \n§ 1025(a).  For these reasons, Duffy’s view that congestion pricing was not authorized by the \nVPPP borders on being specious. \n27.  In the decades since the VPPP was enacted, Congress and FHWA have both \nrepeatedly concluded that the VPPP authorizes cordon-based congestion pricing in New York City \nand that the revenues from such a program may be used to fund transit infrastructure.  Duffy’s \nabrupt and politically motivated departure from this consensus provides no legitimate basis for \nFHWA’s reversal of its position on the Program, particularly after FHWA reaffirmed the FONSI \nand approved the Program only a few months prior.  And, in stark contrast to the five-year process \nthat led to FHWA’s VPPP approval, Defendants formed this newfound position, and took this \nagency action, a month following the change in administration, despite having provided no \nmeaningful legal analysis as to their ability to terminate or justifications for terminating the \nProgram, and despite having conducted no NEPA review of the effects on the environment from \nceasing tolling and reintroducing tens of thousands of additional vehicular trips into the CBD daily, \npreventing improvements to the region’s public transit infrastructure, or terminating the EJ \nmitigation committed to as part of the Program and to be funded through Program revenue.   \n28.  Further  demonstrating  the  pretextual  and  arbitrary  nature  of  the  termination, \nDuffy’s rationale is in direct conflict with his stated policy to “prioritize” projects “that utilize \nuser-pay models,” like Congestion Pricing.  It also runs afoul of Duffy’s own recent remarks that \nsaving people time on their commutes would be part of his mission as Secretary.  As Duffy stated \n  13   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 14 of 111\n \nduring a conference of state highway and transportation officials on February 5, 2025, the \nAdministration should be committed to creating projects that:  \nMak[e] people’s lives better.  What you do makes people’s lives \nbetter.  We’re able to get to work and back home to see our loved \nones more quickly.  If we don’t have our systems that are delayed \nand we don’t sit in traffic we get to spend an extra 15 minutes, \nmaybe an extra 45 minutes a day with the ones that we love as \nopposed to listening to music or a podcast or, I don’t know what you \nlisten to in the car, but whatever you’re listening to in the car, or on \nthe train.  We can make people’s lives better and spend time with \nthe  people  we  love  as  opposed  to  going  to  the  grind  of  our \ntransportation system.19   \nOf course, the threatened cancellation of Congestion Pricing after it’s already been operating \nsuccessfully for more than three months actually would be the opposite of “making people’s lives \nbetter” in this important way.  \n29.  In addition to being inconsistent with the Administration’s own broader policy \nstatements, the purported termination of the Program runs contrary to its purported respect for \nfederalism.  The Program is the first congestion pricing program of its kind to be implemented in \nthe United States, a necessary solution to the unique policy challenges facing the New York \nmetropolitan region and one that reflects the will of the majority of New Yorkers and their elected \nrepresentatives at every level of government.  Indeed, the clear consensus of the experts and policy \nmakers that have studied the issue is that cordon pricing is the most effective method to reduce \ncongestion in Manhattan—a narrow island with a dense network of roads and numerous points of \ningress and egress.  It is also a program that could provide a pathway for other congested urban \nareas to reduce congestion and fund public transit.

Duffy  described  the  proposal  as \n“Outrageous!” and accused the State of “trying to fill the gap with highway funds and taxing the \nworking class”—invoking a term opponents to Congestion Pricing have used to disparage the \ntolls—rather than “actually fixing their financial mismanagement.”  Using the same language from \nhis earlier X post demanding that New York end the Program, Duffy once again warned that “[t]he \nfederal government is not a blank check.” \n \nFigure 3: Mar. 25, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n33.

In light of this background, on April 2, 2025, the MTA and TBTA asked counsel \nfor the Federal Defendants during a meet-and-confer for the initial conference in this matter if their \nclients intend to take unilateral action to enforce the April 20 “deadline.”  Counsel for the Federal \nDefendants “did not have information to provide” regarding the timing or likelihood of any such \nactions by their clients.

New York Passes the Traffic Mobility Act as the Solution to the New York City Area’s \nLongstanding Congestion Problems \n49.  Traffic congestion has long plagued the New York metropolitan area.  For decades, \ncongestion has stymied economic growth and harmed the environment and public health, as well \nas quality of life in the region.   \n50.  Congestion on New York City roads, and in the CBD in particular, has a serious \nnegative impact on public health.  As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has \nrecognized, higher vehicle traffic leads to higher vehicle emissions, which are associated with \nnegative health impacts like “asthma onset and aggravation, cardiovascular disease, reduced lung \nfunction, impaired lung development in children, pre-term and low-birthweight infants, childhood \n  21   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 22 of 111\n \nleukemia, and premature death.”26  FHWA has consistently acknowledged that “less vehicle traffic \ncan improve air quality and reduce chronic lower respiratory diseases.”27  \n51.  Congestion also increases travel times, eroding worker productivity, reducing bus \nand paratransit service, raising the cost of deliveries, and impeding the movement of emergency \nvehicles.  A 2018 study estimated that “traffic congestion [would] be a $100 billion drag” on the \nmetropolitan-area economy over the next five years, and identified Manhattan below 60th street—\nwhere a quarter of the economic activity is concentrated—as the primary source of traffic \ncongestion in the region.28   \n52.  As noted above, the concept of congestion pricing was first developed in the 1950s \nby Nobel laureate and Columbia University economist William S. Vickrey, who believed that it \noffered a market-based solution to overcrowding, whether on subway cars or New York City’s \nstreets.  Responding to concerns that some might see congestion pricing “as a tax increase,” \nProfessor Vickrey explained that “when motorists’ time is considered, it’s really a savings.”29   \n53.  In 1959, Professor Vickrey testified before the Congressional Joint Committee on \nWashington Metropolitan Problems to outline “pricing solutions to urban transport problems,” \nincluding a tolling scheme that would later be described as congestion pricing.30  During his \ntestimony, Vickrey stated, “[i]t is a specific feature of the pricing system suggested here that it is \n \n26 OFF.

In 1975, Singapore, a small island city-state long plagued by congestion, first put \nProfessor Vickrey’s ideas into practice by implementing its famous Area Licensing Scheme, \npursuant to which vehicles entering Singapore’s Central Business District were required to pay a \ndaily toll.34  Singapore’s Area Licensing Scheme was a success and is widely credited with \ndramatically reducing traffic in Singapore’s central business district, even as the nation’s economy \nand population have continued to grow.35 \n55.  In 2003, London put Professor Vickrey’s idea into practice and moved forward with \na congestion pricing program of its own.  The program was an immediate success.  Within the first \nyear of its implementation, London saw a 30% reduction in congestion within the charging zone \nand an 18% reduction in the number of vehicles entering the zone. 36  The city also experienced \nsignificant increases in the number of commuters choosing to use public transit, including a 38% \n \n31 Id. at 47. \n32 Id.  \n33 Id.  \n34 Kian-Keong Chin, Road Pricing – Singapore’s 30 Years of Experience, CESIFO DICE REPORT (2005), \nhttps://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/166848/1/ifo-dice-report-v03-y2005-i3-p12-16.pdf. \n35 Id. \n36 Transp.

In 2006, Stockholm implemented a congestion charge for its central business \ndistrict on a six-month trial basis, after which citizens would be given a chance to vote on the \nprogram’s future.  On the eve of launch, fewer than 40% of Stockholm residents supported the \nplan.39  Following implementation of the program, however, Stockholm experienced a 20% \ndecrease in traffic volumes and popular support for the program began to surge.  After the trial \nexpired, a referendum to make the program permanent passed in 2007, and public support for the \nprogram rose to over 65%.40 \n57.  In 2011, the people of Milan passed a referendum authorizing Area C, a new \ncongestion pricing toll for vehicles entering the city’s central business district. 41   Under an earlier \nversion of the program, introduced in 2008, higher polluting vehicles were charged for access to \nthe central business district, while less polluting vehicles were able to enter for free.  Area C was \nenacted to further reduce traffic congestion in the central business district by tolling vehicles that \nenter the district.  Area C caused a 28% decrease in road congestion, a 24% reduction in road \ncasualties, and significant decreases in pollutants.42  \n58.

The Legislature further found that the underfunding of New York City’s aging \nsubway infrastructure has “a deleterious impact on the health, safety, and livelihood of commuters, \ntourists, resident New Yorkers” as well as “the economy of the state of New York,” such that “a \nlong-term and sustainable solution is necessary in order to ensure stable and reliable funding” for \nthis “important mass transit asset.”  Id.  Consequently, the Legislature declared that to ensure the \n“public health and safety of New York’s residents,” the creation of a congestion pricing program \nin the Manhattan CBD was “a matter of substantial state concern.”  Id. \n61.  The TMA authorizes and directs TBTA to “establish the central business district \ntolling program,” id. § 1704 (1), grants TBTA the power “to establish and charge variable tolls and \nfees for vehicles entering or remaining in the [CBD],”43 and authorizes TBTA “to make rules and \n \n43 As delineated by the Act, the CBD encompasses the geographic area of Manhattan south and inclusive of 60th \nStreet, but not including the FDR Drive, the West Side Highway, the Battery Park Underpass, and any surface roadway \nportion of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel connecting to West Street.

Congestion Pricing Tolling Authority Under the Federal Value Pricing Pilot Program \n62.  Because Congestion Pricing would impose a toll on several federal-aid highways \nin Manhattan, the federal government has taken the position that the Program could not begin \nwithout federal approval.  Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL 3251732, \nat *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2024) (Liman, J.).  \n63.  The authority of the States to impose tolls on roadways within their borders has \nbeen recognized since the early days of the Republic, and the Supreme Court has consistently held \nas a matter of history and tradition that each State, as a coequal sovereign, is “empowered” to \nimpose “uniform, fair and practical” tolls “for the privilege of using its roads.”  Evansville-\nVanderburgh Airport Auth. Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U.S. 707, 715 (1972) (collecting \ncases); see also Cong. Rsch. Serv., R43575, Tolling U.S. Highways 1–3 (Aug. 26, 2016). \n64.  When Congress established the forerunner of today’s federal-aid highway program \nin 1916, it determined that highways built under that program should be free from tolls.  But that \ngeneral rule, which is today codified at 23 U.S.C. § 301, was almost immediately the subject of \nnumerous carve outs, see, e.g., Oldfield Act of 1927, Pub. L. 69-773 (Mar. 3, 1927) (permitting \nthe use of federal funds to build toll bridges), and today tolls are permitted on federal-aid highways \nunder a wide variety of statutory exceptions, including exceptions that authorize tolling on new \ninfrastructure, tolling on additional lanes added to existing highways, tolling on construction and \n  26   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 27 of 111\n \nconversion of toll-free highways to toll highways, and tolling in connection with high-occupancy \nvehicle lanes, see, e.g., 23 U.S.C. §§ 129, 166.44 \n65.  One such exception is the VPPP, which was enacted into law as the “Congestion \nPricing Pilot Program” as part of ISTEA, a watershed transportation reform bill sponsored and led \nby U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York.  As Congress explained in enacting ISTEA, its \nintention was to foster sweeping change in the nation’s transportation networks in order to \n“develop a National Intermodal Transportation System” consisting “of all forms of transportation \nin a unified, interconnected manner,” which “shall include significant improvements in public \ntransportation necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, \ninternational competitiveness, and mobility.”  ISTEA § 2 (emphasis added).  To this end, among \nother things, Congress included in ISTEA substantial funding for mass transit programs, which \nCongress found to be an integral part of the “National Intermodal Transportation System,” id., and \n“granted states ‘greater flexibility to operate toll facilities and use toll revenues for a variety of \ntransportation projects’” including congestion pricing programs.  Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL 5199945, at *33 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (Liman, J.) (quoting Am. \nTrucking Assn’s, Inc. v. N.Y. State Thruway Auth., 886 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir. 2018)).  As President \nBush explained when signing ISTEA into law, a “major element” of the legislation was “to provide \nState  and  local  officials  unprecedented  flexibility,”  including  the  discretion  to  finance \ntransportation  improvements  “with  toll  revenue”  and  to  use  transportation  funds  “on  the \nimprovements that [will] best meet local needs, whether highway projects or public transit \n \n44  See  also  OFF.

Consistent with these objectives, ISTEA greatly expanded the circumstances in \nwhich States could collect toll revenues on federal-aid highways.  In Section 1012(a) of ISTEA \n(codified, as amended, at 23 U.S.C. § 129), Congress permitted the collection of tolls on new or \nreconstructed infrastructure, including highways, bridges, or tunnels.  See ISTEA § 1012(a)(1).   \n67.  In Section 1012(b) of ISTEA (codified, as amended, at 23 U.S.C. § 149 note), \nCongress authorized the creation of a separate tolling program, the Congestion Pricing Pilot \nProgram, renamed the VPPP in 1998.  Pursuant to Section 1012(b), Congress directed the \nSecretary of Transportation to “solicit the participation of State and local governments and public \nauthorities for one or more congestion pricing pilot programs,” and authorized him to “enter into” \nagreements to “establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing projects.”  ISTEA § 1012(b).45   \n68.  Section 1012(b) further authorized the Secretary “to allow the use of tolls” by \nstates, local governments, and public authorities “as part of a pilot program under this section.”  \nId. § 1012(b)(4).  In contrast to Section 1012(a), Congress imposed notably fewer restrictions on \nthe use of tolling revenue generated under the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program pursuant to \nSection 1012(b), requiring only that “[r]evenues generated by any pilot project” be “applied to \nprojects eligible under” Title 23.  Id. § 1012(b)(3).  Transit capital projects are eligible for federal \nassistance under 23 U.S.C. § 142(a)(2).  ISTEA also provided that the Secretary must periodically \nreport on the effects that VPPP projects have on not only congestion but also “transit ridership … \nand availability of funds for transportation programs.”  ISTEA § 1012(b)(5).  \n \n45 See also 49 C.F.R. § 1.85(c)(22).  FHWA provides tolling authority under the VPPP by entering into tolling \nagreements with the relevant state actors.  See Value Pricing Pilot Program Participation, Fiscal Years 2010 and \n2011, 75 F.R. 64397, 64403 (Nov. 19, 2010). \n  28   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 29 of 111\n \n69.  In a different section of ISTEA, Congress made clear that it expected, and indeed \nrequired, that States should consider congestion pricing programs as a means of generating revenue \nfor  public  transit  projects.    Section  1025  of  ISTEA  directed  States,  in  coordination  with \nmetropolitan planning organizations, to “undertake a continuous transportation planning process \nwhich shall” consider “the use of innovative mechanisms for financing projects, including … \ncongestion pricing.”  ISTEA § 1025(c)(16).   \n70.  Although “congestion pricing” was not defined in ISTEA, the concept was then \n(and is today) commonly understood worldwide to include cordon pricing.  Indeed, Singapore had \nalready been using such a form of congestion pricing at the time ISTEA was passed for nearly two \ndecades.  And in 1987, just a few years before the enactment of ISTEA, New York City Mayor Ed \nKoch testified before a Congressional subcommittee about a congestion pricing proposal in New \nYork City that would charge drivers entering Manhattan’s central business district $10 per day.  \nOzone and Carbon Monoxide Problems: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Health and Env’t of \nthe H. Comm. on Energy & Commerce, 100 Cong. 55 (1987).  \n71.  This is confirmed by statements in the legislative record when ISTEA was enacted \nin 1991, and reinforced by Congress’s subsequent re-enactments (and indeed expansion) of \ncongestion pricing in 1995, 1998, and 2005, reflecting a clear common understanding that \ncongestion pricing includes cordon pricing and contemplates as a goal the raising of revenue to \npromote public transit (and so further reduce congestion).  See Pub. L. 104-59, § 325(e) (Nov. 28, \n1995); Pub. L. 105-178, § 1216(a) (June 9, 1998); Pub. L. 105-206, § 9006(b) (July 22, 1998); \nPub. L. 109-59, § 1604(a) (Aug. 10, 2005).  Not once has Congress questioned FHWA’s now-\nprior interpretation of the VPPP (discussed infra) or sought to amend the statute to prohibit cordon \npricing or the generation of revenue for mass transit through tolling authorized under the VPPP. \n  29   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 30 of 111\n \n72.  During  legislative  deliberations  regarding  ISTEA  in  1991,  Senator  Moynihan \nexplained that the goal was to permit States to launch “innovative congestion pricing experiments” \nof different varieties.  137 Cong. Rec. S18203-02 (daily ed. Nov. 26, 1991).  On March 21, 1991, \nat a hearing of the Subcommittee on Water Resources, Transportation, and Infrastructure on \n“Congestion Pricing and Infrastructure Financing,” convened by Senator Moynihan in advance of \nthe introduction of ISTEA, the Subcommittee took testimony from experts on cordon pricing \ninitiatives implemented by Singapore and Hong Kong, which Senator Joe Lieberman noted \nfavorably in his remarks, stating that he was “particularly interested in the congestion-pricing \nmethods suggested by our hearing witnesses today.”  Congestion Pricing and Infrastructure \nFinancing: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Water Res., Transp., and Infrastructure of the S. \nComm. on Env’t & Pub. Works, 102 Cong. 9 (1991).46  Senator Moynihan agreed that cordon \npricing appeared to be a promising avenue for experimentation: “Singapore is doing it, Hong Kong \nis doing it, we are talking about it.”  Id. at 24.  Senator David Durenberger likewise recognized \nthat “congestion pricing may also be an important means which some cities will employ to reduce \nair quality problems and ease gridlock.”  Id.  at 3.  Don Pickrell, an economist for USDOT at the \ntime, encouraged Congress to “remove any remaining restrictions on … pricing of highways \nconstructed with Federal financial assistance” and to promote measures including “downtown \nlicensing requirements, ala Singapore,” i.e., cordon pricing.  Id. at 18.  When the Subcommittee \nreconvened four days later on March 25, 1991, Peter Mieszkowski, a professor of economics at \nRice University, cautioned in his testimony that imposing congestion tolls only on freeways would \n \n46 From July 1983 to March 1985, the British Government of the Territory of Hong Kong implemented a 21-month \ncongestion pricing trial program, which charged vehicles for entering congested portions of the city.   Although the \nprogram was generally perceived as successful, it was not continued at the end of the trial period due to a variety of \nreasons, including protests, an increase in roadway capacity, and the beginning of the political transition from British \nto Chinese governance. \n  30   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 31 of 111\n \nbe ineffective “because people will simply leave the freeway” and “go to the other access roads, \nwhich will themselves become very congested.  So the congestion policy I think has to be general.”  \nReauthorization of the Federal-Aid Highway Program: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on Env’t & \nPub. Works and the Subcomm. on Water Res., Transp., and Infrastructure, 102 Cong. 40 (1991).  \nSenator Moynihan responded: “Well, you [meaning, local leaders] have got to figure it out \nyourself.  But, yes, not just limit it to some particular Federal road, right.”  Id. (emphasis added).   \n73.  Further evidence that Congress understood “congestion pricing” to include cordon \npricing can be found in the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549 \n(Nov. 15, 1990), which was enacted into law just one year before ISTEA.  In that bill, the Clean \nAir Act was amended to require the EPA Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of \nTransportation, to provide transportation agencies information regarding the formulation and \nemission reduction potential of “transportation control measures,” including “programs to limit or \nrestrict vehicle use in downtown areas or other areas of emission concentration particularly during \nperiods of peak use.”  42 U.S.C. § 7408(f)(1)(A).  During a September 1989 hearing before the \nSenate Subcommittee on Environmental Protection, several witnesses objected to the inclusion of \n“transportation control measures” such as tolling vehicles “to enter central business districts.”  \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1989: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Env’t Protection of the S. \nComm. of Env’t & Pub. Works, 101 Cong. 67-68 (1989) (testimony of Regina McLaurin, President \nof the National Parking Association and Ethan Geto of the Coalition for Improved Transportation \nand Air Quality).  Senators Max Baucus and Lieberman, who were members of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works that oversaw the passage of ISTEA, both rejected the witnesses’ \nconcerns with the inclusion of transportation control measures, noting that localities needed \nflexibility when addressing traffic congestion and air pollution.  Id. at 70 (remarks of Senator \n  31   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 32 of 111\n \nBaucus); id. at 72-73 (remarks of Senator Lieberman).  The language to which the witnesses \nobjected was included in the final text of the bill and remains in force today. \n74.  Moreover, as the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ report on \nISTEA explained, the purpose of the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program was to allow states to \n“establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing programs” and to study, among other things, \nthe effects of such programs on “the availability of funds for transportation programs.”  S. Rep. \nNo. 102-71, at 26 (1991).  That same report noted that the bill was intended to place “[i]ncreased \nemphasis” on the “use of innovative financing mechanisms including … congestion pricing.”  Id.  \nIn other words, everyone, including the relevant members of Congress, understood that congestion \npricing included cordon pricing, and that this form of tolling could reduce congestion and fund \npublic  transit  alternatives—exactly  as  Congress  desired  in  giving  States  broad  leeway  in \nexperimenting with ways to solve the problem, including through tolling under the VPPP. \n75.  This ordinary meaning of “congestion pricing” was consistently echoed by FHWA \nitself from the early 1990s until early 2025.  In congressional testimony provided in 1992 shortly \nafter ISTEA was enacted, FHWA was asked by Senator Lautenberg: “How is FHWA defining \ncongestion pricing projects?”  Dep’t of Transp. & Related Agencies Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n1993: Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the S. Comm. on Appropriations, 102 Cong. 352 (1992).  \nFHWA responded that it “intend[ed] to define congestion pricing projects to provide useful \ndemonstrations of congestion pricing concepts,” and noted that the “potential scope of congestion \npricing applications can vary widely, ranging from pricing on a new or existing single road facility \nto more comprehensive area-wide road pricing strategies.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n76.  In 1998, Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of \n1998, which renamed the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program the “Value Pricing Pilot Program” and \n  32   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 33 of 111\n \nexpanded  the  Secretary’s  authority  to  enter  into  agreements  authorizing  value  pricing  pilot \nprograms.  Pub. L. 105-178 § 1216 (June 9, 1998).  As FHWA has explained, “value pricing” is a \nsynonym for congestion pricing, and the agency often uses the two terms interchangeably.47  \nLikewise, the House Conference report confirms that, in renaming the “Congestion Pricing Pilot \nProgram the VPPP, Congress did not intend to alter the scope of the statute.”  See H.R. CONF. \nREP. 105-550, 407, 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. 70, 79 (referring to past projects authorized under the \nCongestion Pricing Pilot Program as “value pricing projects”).  If anything, Congress intended to \nbroaden the scope of the program to provide “additional flexibility.”  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. \nH10497 (Oct. 10, 1998) (extraneous matter submitted by Representative Shuster). \n77.  Contemporaneous  with  this  new  statutory  enactment,  FHWA  issued  a  VPPP \nfactsheet (“1998 VPPP Fact Sheet”) explaining that VPPP projects “have the flexibility to \nencompass a variety of value pricing applications, including areawide pricing….”48  Another 1998 \nFHWA publication in the Federal Register (the “1998 FR Notice”) identified “[a]pplications of \nvalue pricing which are comprehensive, such as areawide pricing, [and] pricing of multiple \nfacilities or corridors,” as meriting “highest priority for Federal support” under the VPPP.  63 Fed. \nReg. 53487 (Oct. 5, 1998) (emphasis added).  FHWA went on to note that “[m]ore limited \napplications of value pricing are also acceptable,” indicating that FHWA viewed areawide or \ncordon pricing schemes as the intended primary focus of the VPPP.  Id.  The Notice explained that \nFHWA would give special priority to “[p]rojects which indicate that revenues will be used to \nsupport the goals of the value pricing program,” and “projects that lead to substantial congestion \n \n47 See, e.g., FED.

In 1999, FHWA published “A Guide to Federal Aid Programs and Projects” (“1999 \nVPPP Guide”), which listed “area-wide pricing” as the first example of a VPPP concept, as well \nas a VPPP “Notice of Grant Opportunities” (“1999 VPPP NOGO”), which listed “areawide value \npricing” as a “project of interest,” and explained that such projects include “[f]ees for entering an \narea, sometimes called cordon crossing charges, using electronic vehicle identification devices.”50  \nThe 1999 VPPP NOGO also listed “revenue generation” as a potential benefit of VPPP projects \nand noted that “[p]roposals with the greatest potential to reduce congestion and advance current \nknowledge of price effects, operations, enforcement, revenue generation, equity mitigation and \nmonitoring/evaluation mechanisms will be given the highest priority.”51  Indeed, that notice \nrecognized that existing projects were already “generating revenues that c[ould] be used to further \nenhance urban mobility.”52   \n79.  A May 2001 notice soliciting applications for participation in the VPPP again \nclassified “applications of value pricing which are comprehensive, such as area wide pricing,” as \namong the projects that would “receive highest priority for Federal support.”  66 Fed. Reg. 23,077 \n(May 7, 2001) (emphasis added).   \n \n49 A subsequent publication used identical language, reinforcing that “generating surface transportation revenues” is \na core purpose of the VPPP.  71 Fed.

In 2001 and 2002, the Florida Department of Transportation and Lee County took \nFHWA up on its solicitation and received $1,545,600 in VPPP funding to study a cordon toll to \naccess Fort Myers Beach (the “Fort Myers Project”).53  The study examined tolling the only two \npoints of entry to Fort Myers Beach.54  No toll-free route to Fort Myers Beach was contemplated.55  \nFigure 5: Fort Myers Beach Cordon Toll Locations56 \n \n \n53 U.S. GOV’T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., Report to the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban \nDevelopment and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives 42-43 (Jan. 2012), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-12-119.pdf.   \n54 Advances in Transportation Studies, Predicted Driver Response to a Cordon Toll Around Fort Myers Beach, \nFlorida (2005), https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237385152_ \nPredicted_driver_response_to_a_cordon_toll_around_Fort_Myers_Beach_Florida.  \n55 FED.

In 2005, Congress passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act (“SAFETEA-LU”) of 2005, which further broadened States’ authority to toll the \nfederal-aid highway system.   \n82.  A Federal Register notice in January 2006 reiterated that “applications of value \npricing which are comprehensive and include pricing of currently free facilities, such as area wide \npricing” are “[p]rojects of [i]nterest.”  71 Fed. Reg. 970 (Jan. 6, 2006) (emphases added).  \nSimilarly, a 2006 FHWA report on the VPPP also underscored the role of tolls in metropolitan \nareas to support transit infrastructure, emphasizing that “[v]alue priced tolls on existing or new \nhighway lanes in currently congested metropolitan areas can provide a significant source of user-\nbased revenue to pay for the high costs of improving or expanding transportation infrastructure,” \nparticularly where local governments are seeking to make up for shortfalls in revenue.57 \n83.  New York City’s own history with FHWA further demonstrates that, as FHWA has \nlong recognized, cordon pricing and revenue generation are permitted by the VPPP.   \n84.  In April 2007, then-mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed an $8 toll on all vehicles \nentering Manhattan below 86th Street.58  New York City and FHWA entered into an Urban \nPartnership Agreement (“UPA”), attached hereto as Exhibit F, in which FHWA agreed to award \nNew York City $5 million in VPPP funding to pursue “a broad area pricing system in Manhattan \nsouth of 86th Street.”  UPA at 3.

Congress was well aware of the New York City’s 2007 proposal and discussed it at \nlength during a June 7, 2007 House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure hearing on “Congestion and Mobility” in order “to receive \ntestimony on the problem of congestion facing our nation’s surface transportation system and some \nof the options to deal with the problem.”61  Notably, the Subcommittee’s report emphasized the \nproblem of congestion in urban areas and observed that one option, “congestion pricing,” “can be \nimplemented in several different forms,” including “impos[ing] tolls … around a specified area \nsuch [as] the downtown of a city, or over a wider region.”62  During the hearing, Federal Transit \nAdministrator James Simpson, nominated by President Bush, was asked to share the “best idea” \nthat he had heard recently that would “make the most improvement” in managing congestion, and \nhe replied “New York is really bold.  What they are proposing now … [is] to have an access fee, \nsimilar to London, south of 86th Street to Lower Manhattan to free up maybe 5 or 10 percent of the \ntraffic.”63  Administrator Simpson also observed that “the beauty of this program is whatever we \ninvest in now … this congestion pricing will throw off about $300 million a year to finance such \n \n59 FED.

Also in 2005, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (“SFCTA”) \nreceived a $1,040,000 VPPP grant to evaluate the feasibility of area or cordon pricing for San \nFranscico (the “San Francisco Project”).65  The San Franscisco Project included a Northeast \nQuadrant cordon/area-wide pricing concept with no toll-free routes to enter the congestion zone.66  \nA key goal of the San Francisco Project was to develop a comprehensive transportation system \nmanagement strategy, which “not only contemplates congestion charging, but also focuses on the \nimprovement of competitive alternatives to driving by using the revenues generated through \npricing to support investments in transit, bicycling, and walking.”67  With this goal in mind, the \nSan Francisco Project study concluded that options involving a smaller cordon would not generate \nenough revenue to “enhance travel options.”68   \n \n64 Id.  \n65 SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSP.

By 2009, FHWA continued to lament, in its report to Congress, that “the projects \nimplemented so far have not had significant impacts on congestion or the other objectives of the \nVPPP because they typically only involve ‘partial’ pricing of a highway facility,” while the VPPP \n“initially contemplated” “more comprehensive pricing strategies.”73  “To further the VPPP’s \nobjectives,” FHWA wrote: \nThe VPPP portfolio of implemented projects should include pilot \nimplementations of broad congestion pricing projects involving tolls \non all lanes of a highway facility, all roads in a congested area, or \nall roads of an entire roadway network.  Such approaches tend to \ntake away the choice to drive alone for free in a congested area.74   \n \n90.

Similarly, a 2016 FHWA report to Congress on the status of the VPPP described \n“efforts and initiatives to effectively support and mainstream congestion pricing” as a “focal point \nfor FHWA programs.”86  FHWA anticipated that more ambitious “second-generation” projects \nwould rise in prominence under the VPPP in coming years, noting that they “are likely to combine \nregionwide pricing strategies, such as vehicle miles traveled fees, cordon pricing, and regional \npricing, along with a non-toll blueprint.”87  FHWA even singled out New York City specifically \nas likely to benefit from “some form of cordon pricing.”88  \n \n85 TREASURE ISLAND MOBILITY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, Treasure Island Mobility Management Study Summary \nReview 1 (July 2016), https://www.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/2019-\n03/TIMM%20Study%20Summary%20Report.pdf. \n86 FED.

This is confirmed by more recent congressional consideration of tolling under the \nVPPP.  Shortly after the passage of the TMA, on September 11, 2019, the House Subcommittee \non Highways and Transit held a hearing on “Pricing and Technology Strategies to Address \nCongestion,” which included a discussion of the Program and the TMA itself.  In the summary \nprepared by committee staff prior to the hearing, congestion pricing is defined as “a variably-\npriced lane, such as an Express Lane or HOT Lane; a variable toll on an entire roadway or facility; \nor a cordon charge that is levied on drivers to enter or move within a specifically-designated \narea.”89  The summary noted that “the VPPP allows toll revenues to be used on projects eligible \nunder Title 23,” which includes public transit projects.90  The Committee’s final report on the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 makes clear the Committee’s understanding that \nISTEA “clearly states” that revenue generated by a pilot project can and should be used for \n“projects  eligible  under  title  23”  including  “transit  safety  infrastructure  improvements  and \nprograms” and “for new transit service, system or service expansion”: \nIt  is  the  sense  of  the  Committee  that  the  Department  of \nTransportation carry out the Value Pricing Pilot Program consistent \nwith  the  statutory  requirements  of  that  program  and  the \nDepartment’s  longstanding  interpretation  of  title  23.    Section \n1012(b)(3) of ISTEA, as amended, clearly states that any project \nrevenues in excess of pilot project operating costs may be used for \nany projects eligible under title 23.  Under 23 USC 133(b)(4), \n“transit  safety  infrastructure  improvements  and  programs”  are \neligible under the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, and \nit has been FHWA’s longstanding interpretation that Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality funds may be used for new transit \nservice,  system  or  service  expansion,  new  vehicles,  and  fare \nsubsidies, if such projects or programs improve air quality. \n \nH.

In 2021, the Utah Department of Transportation submitted an Expression of Interest \nfor a project aimed at reducing congestion at Little Cottonwood Canyon, including a cordon \npricing component.91  Specifically, under four alternatives studied in the project’s Environmental \nImpact Statement (“EIS”), a toll or a ban on single-occupant vehicles would be implemented on \nS.R. 210—the only available route connecting the area’s ski resorts and Little Cottonwood \nCanyon.92  The EIS for the Little Cottonwood Canyon project notes that tolling revenue may be \nused for “the operation and maintenance costs of the transit system to reduce fares to make transit \nan attractive option to paying a toll.”93  FHWA noted this project in its most recent report to \nCongress on the VPPP submitted in 2023.94 \n96.  FHWA’s current guidance and website reinforces the longstanding commonsense \nproposition that congestion pricing includes cordon pricing and has as a goal revenue generation \nto  support  public  transit.

The Project Sponsors Apply for VPPP Tolling Authority and Conduct a Lengthy \nEnvironmental Review Process In Reliance on FHWA’s Statements that the VPPP was \nthe “Best Fit” for the Program \n99.  In 2019, FHWA once again confirmed its long-held interpretation that cordon or \n“area” pricing and revenue generation are permitted under the VPPP, this time in representations \nmade  directly  to  the  Project  Sponsors  in  connection  with  FHWA’s  consideration  of  their \napplication for tolling authority for the Program.   \n100.  Following passage of the TMA, the Project Sponsors engaged in meetings and \ntelephone conferences with FHWA regarding the Program and provided detailed explanations of \nits contemplated operation.  Those explanations included that tolling would apply to vehicles that \nenter the CBD, defined as below and inclusive of 60th Street (with the exception of vehicles using \nthe FDR Drive, West Side Highway, the Battery Park Underpass, and any surface roadway portion \nof the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel connecting to West Street) in order to reduce the severe congestion \nin the CBD.  In addition, it was explained that the Program would incorporate toll rates that would \nprovide a new and recurring source of revenue for the MTA, with net revenues (after paying for \nProgram operational costs) to be dedicated to capital improvements identified in the MTA’s 2020-\n2024 Capital Plan.  USDOT and FHWA representatives made clear at these meetings that, given \nthe nature of the Program, the VPPP is the appropriate vehicle to provide tolling authority on \nfederal-aid highways for a cordon-based congestion pricing project like the Program.  The federal \nagencies explained that NYSDOT already had one of the 15 “slots” allotted in the VPPP and could \nhave multiple congestion pricing projects under that “slot,” including the Program.  USDOT and \nFHWA further explained that there would need to be a VPPP agreement between FHWA and the \nProject Sponsors.  At a meeting on April 24, 2019, it was agreed that FHWA would forward to the \nProject Sponsors a template for a VPPP Expression of Interest, which was needed to commence \n  47   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 48 of 111\n \nthe approval process under the VPPP, as well as an example of an agreement that the Project \nSponsors would need to enter into with FHWA once approved. \n101.  On June 17, 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted the EoI, Exhibit A, seeking \nauthorization to implement a variable tolling program aimed at reducing congestion (i.e., a \ncongestion pricing program) in the CBD.

The EoI was clear that the Project Sponsors \ncontemplated implementing a cordon pricing program, noting that “[v]ehicles would be charged a \ntoll to enter or remain within the Manhattan CBD” and that “vehicles would be charged to enter \nor remain within a specific area.”  Id. at 3-4.  The Project Sponsors were likewise clear that \ngenerating revenue for mass transit was another goal of the Program, noting that “revenues \ngenerated by the program would be used to construct, operate and maintain the CBD toll collection \nprogram and modernize the MTA transit system, with the goal of attracting new riders and further \nreducing vehicle demand for scarce road capacity in and connecting to the Manhattan CBD.”  Id. \nat 4; see also id. at 3 (“Revenue raised by the program will provide sustained funding for public \ntransportation, which as it becomes more reliable, will contribute to congestion relief.”).  As the \nProject Sponsors explained, “[b]y creating a new sustainable revenue source, the CBD tolling \nprogram would enable the MTA to invest in improving its transportation network, which in turn, \nwould support the program’s goals of increasing transit ridership and improving transit services \nfor low-income residents.”  Id. at 6.  The EoI did not contemplate an end date for the Program, but \ninstead stated that the Project Sponsors would prepare reports on “the effects of the program” once \n“every two years … for the life of the program.”  Id. at 6. \n  48   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 49 of 111\n \n102.  On October 24, 2019, then FHWA Administrator Nicole R. Nason, nominated by \nPresident Trump during his first term, responded to the Project Sponsor’s EoI in a letter addressed \nto the Executive Deputy Commissioner of NYSDOT (“FHWA Response”), attached hereto as \nExhibit G.  According to the Trump Administration at the time, “[u]nder the various programs in \nFederal law that allow tolling of existing infrastructure, the VPPP appears to be the best potential \nfit.”  FHWA Response at 1.   \n103.  Following  FHWA’s  response  to  the  EoI,  a  years-long  environmental  review \nprocess under NEPA ensued.  In assessing the Program, FHWA specifically considered the \nProgram’s purpose “to reduce traffic congestion in the [CBD] in a manner that will generate \nrevenue for future transportation improvements,” and its specific objectives of: (1) reducing daily \nVMT within the CBD by at least five percent; (2) reducing the number of vehicles entering the \nCBD daily by at least ten percent; and (3) creating a funding source for capital improvements and \ngenerating sufficient annual net revenues to fund $15 billion for capital projects.101  \n104.  On August 10, 2022, FHWA and the Project Sponsors issued a Draft Environmental \nAssessment (“Draft EA”), which was informed by early public outreach and comments as well as \ncomplex and comprehensive technical analyses.  The Draft EA identified the Program’s dual \nobjectives; the primary objective of congestion reduction and the complementary objective of \nproviding a reliable source of funding for capital public transit projects.  It examined numerous \ncategories of potential environmental effects, such as the visual effects of tolling infrastructure, \nthe indirect air quality and noise effects of changes in traffic patterns, and the effects on transit \nsystems of shifts in travel mode choice.  In accordance with former Executive Order (“EO”) 12,898 \n \n101 See FED. HIGHWAY ADMIN. et al., Central Business District Tolling Program, Finding of No Significance, Appendix \nA: Final Environmental Assessment at ES-6 (June 14, 2024), https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/environmental-\nassessment.  \n  49   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 50 of 111\n \n(1994), the Draft EA also studied the potential for disproportionately high and adverse effects on \nEJ communities, including the potential effects of traffic diversions on local air quality in the \nlocations throughout the region most likely to experience diversions. \n105.  Because the tolling structure was not yet established when the Draft EA was issued, \nand in order to allow FHWA and the Project Sponsors to better assess the range of potential \nimpacts from the Program, the Draft EA analyzed seven tolling scenarios, each with different \nvariables, using EPA-approved traffic and air quality models to predict changes in regional travel \ndemand and patterns for those scenarios, as compared to predicted conditions in 2023 and 2045 \nwithout the Program.  It then studied the scenarios that yielded the representative worst-case effects \nfor different resource categories (e.g., traffic, noise, etc.) to consider the full range of potential \neffects  from  the  Program.    The  Draft  EA  also  identified  measures  to  mitigate  potential \ndisproportionate and adverse environmental effects and potential effects on EJ populations that \nwere identified in the analyses. \n106.  FHWA and the Project Sponsors provided a 44-day public comment period, during \nwhich anyone could submit comments on the Draft EA.  In late August 2022, FHWA and the \nProject Sponsors held six virtual public hearings, totaling over 38 hours, to discuss the Draft EA.  \nThis was in addition to early outreach conducted while the Draft EA was in development, and \nspecial  outreach  to  communities  and  organizations,  including  multiple  meetings  to  discuss \nenvironmental justice in relation to the Program.  \n107.  On March 30, 2021, while working with the Project Sponsors, then-Acting FHWA \nAdministrator Stephanie Pollack commended the Program, saying: “The FHWA looks forward to \n  50   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 51 of 111\n \nassisting New York so we can arrive at a prompt and informed NEPA determination on this \nimportant and precedent-setting project.”102  \n108.  Between August 2022 and April 2023, FHWA and the Project Sponsors reviewed \nand  prepared  responses  to  each  of  the  thousands  of  comments  and  prepared  a  Final  EA \nincorporating these responses and changes informed by the public input.   \n109.  The Final EA determined that the Program would not have adverse effects on air \nquality because it would not cause exceedances of health-based National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards.  Nevertheless, the Project Sponsors committed to a robust, $155 million mitigation \npackage  over  five  years  to  improve  air  quality  and  public  health  in  EJ  communities  with \npreexisting  pollution  and  health  burdens  throughout  the  region,  with  particular  investments \ndirected to EJ communities in which the Project could cause any increase in truck traffic.   \n110.  The Final EA further predicted that the Program would meet each of the objectives \ndescribed in Paragraph 104 above based on detailed modeling, using the federally approved Best \nPractices Model maintained by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council. \n111.  The Final EA also predicted many beneficial environmental effects of the Program, \nincluding but not limited to: \na.  reducing emissions of harmful air pollutants including volatile organic compounds, \nnitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, carbon dioxide equivalent \n(i.e., greenhouse gases), and Mobile Source Air Toxics, both within the CBD and \nregion-wide, through an overall reduction in VMT region-wide; \n \n102 FED.

In May 2023, FHWA approved the Final EA.  \n113.  Starting on May 12, FHWA made the Final EA and Draft FONSI available for \npublic review for a period of 30 days, from May 12 to June 12, 2023.   \n114.  On June 22, 2023, FHWA issued a FONSI determining that the Program, including \nmitigation, would not have a significant adverse impact on the environment and would not have a \ndisproportionately high and adverse impact on EJ communities or populations.  \n115.  On June 23, 2023, FHWA’s New York Division Administrator signed the FONSI.  \n  52   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 53 of 111\n \n116.  On March 27, 2024, the TBTA Board approved a toll rate schedule through a formal \nratemaking process under New York State law.  \n117.  In June 2024, the Project Sponsors, in consultation with FHWA, completed a \nreevaluation under NEPA (“Reevaluation 1”), which assessed the effects of the approved toll \nstructure.  On June 14, 2024, FHWA concluded that the approved toll structure and associated \nimpacts were analyzed and mitigated appropriately under NEPA, that no additional environmental \nanalysis was warranted, and that the conclusions in the Final EA and FONSI remained valid. \nReevaluation 1 also concluded that the approved toll structure would meet the congestion-\nreduction and revenue goals for the Program and achieve similar environmental benefits to those \ndescribed in the Final EA. \n118.  On June 5, 2024, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a temporary pause \nof the Program.  On November 14, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed that the Program move \nforward with a toll structure approach whereby those toll rates would be phased in gradually over \nthe first several years of the Program (the “Phase-In Approach”), featuring a lower initial toll \namount.   \n119.  In November 2024, the Project Sponsors completed a second reevaluation under \nNEPA (“Reevaluation 2”) to assess the Phase-In Approach.   \n120.  Reevaluation 2 confirmed that under the Phase-In Approach, the Program would \nstill meet its purpose and need, and all of its objectives.  Reevaluation 2 also confirmed that the \nProject  Sponsors  would  still  implement  all  mitigation  commitments,  including  for  EJ \ncommunities, within the same timeframes as contemplated in the Final EA and FONSI.  \n121.  On November 18, 2024, the TBTA Board formally adopted the Phase-In Approach \nto the toll rate schedule. \n  53   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 54 of 111\n \n122.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA approved Reevaluation 2, concluding that the \neffects of the Program were consistent with those disclosed in the EA, that the adopted Phase-In \nApproach of the approved toll structure and impacts associated with it were analyzed and mitigated \naccordingly, and that no additional environmental analysis was warranted.   \nD.  The VPPP Agreement Is Executed by FHWA and the Project Sponsors  \n123.  That same day, on November 21, 2024, FHWA (through Defendant Shepherd) and \nthe Project Sponsors signed an agreement under the VPPP authorizing the Program’s collection of \ntolls and requiring (among other things) implementation of the mitigation commitments made in \nthe FONSI.  \n124.  The VPPP Agreement reflects FHWA’s determination that “this Agreement is \nnecessary to oversee and administer the collection of tolls pursuant to Section 1012(b)(4) of \nISTEA,” VPPP Agmt. at 1, and states in relevant part that “[e]ffective on the date of this Agreement, \nthe project is approved as a pilot program,” id., cl. 8, and that TBTA is authorized to “operate the \nProgram as a toll Project in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and as a value pricing \nproject,” id., cl. 1.  FHWA further agreed that “the imposition of tolls under this Agreement does \nnot render Federal-aid highways within the State of New York generally ineligible for Federal-aid \nhighway funds where such highways are otherwise eligible under the particular funding program.”  \nId., cl. 5.  The VPPP Agreement provides that TBTA may use “toll revenues received from the \noperation of the Project” for, among other things, “any other projects eligible for assistance under \ntitle 23, United States Code.”  Id., cl. 2. \n125.  In return, the Project Sponsors agreed to a number of obligations in the VPPP \nAgreement, including: (1) “to adequately maintain” federal-aid highways located in the geographic \narea of the Program, id., cl. 6; (2) to submit regular reports on the effects of the Program “on driver \nbehavior, traffic volume, congestion, transit ridership” and other topics to FHWA, id., cl. 8(b); and \n  54   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 55 of 111\n \n(3) “to comply with all Federal laws and requirements applicable to this project, including the laws \nand policies applicable to the Value Pricing Pilot Program,” id., cl. 9.  The VPPP Agreement further \nrequires that the Project Sponsors “identify benefits the application of tolls has in reducing climate \npollution”  and  “demonstrate  the  benefits  mitigation  measures  provide  to  underserved \ncommunities.”  Id., cl. 8(d). \n126.  In addition, the VPPP Agreement requires that FHWA and the Project Sponsors \n“will cooperate and work together in the implementation of the Project.”  Id., cl. 8(a). \n127.  The  VPPP  Agreement  does  not  include  any  provision  authorizing  FHWA  to \nterminate the agreement.  Rather, it contemplates that only TBTA could unilaterally decide to \ndiscontinue the Program, requiring the Project Sponsors to “work with FHWA to return the Project \nto its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id., cl. 11 \n(emphasis added).  The VPPP Agreement further provides that TBTA and NYCDOT shall “monitor \nand report on the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the end of the life of \nthe Project, whichever is sooner.”  Id., cl. (8)(b). \n128.  The VPPP Agreement references FHWA regulations at 23 C.F.R. Part 940 and 950.  \nThese regulations do not grant FHWA authority to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement. \nE.  Plaintiffs Successfully Implement the Program After Facing Numerous Lawsuits \nSeeking to Delay or Prevent Congestion Pricing \n129.  Prior to implementation of the Program, TBTA budgeted over $500 million towards \nefforts to establish the Program, and much of that budget has already been expended.  These \nexpenditures included developing the methodological approach; conducting the assessment and \nextensive outreach and developing the final documentation for the environmental review process \nunder NEPA; design, development, implementation, and testing of the roadway infrastructure and \nsystem; design, development, implementation, and testing of the Back Office System; additional \n  55   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 56 of 111\n \nextensive outreach for the State administrative review process; staff costs, including new staff for \nthe Program; and consulting costs.   \n130.  In late 2024, several groups and individuals, as well as the State of New Jersey, \nsought preliminary injunctive relief on various federal and state constitutional and statutory \ngrounds barring the MTA and TBTA from beginning the Program or collecting tolls.  Each of \nthese claims for injunctive relief was rejected by the courts.  See Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL 5199945 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (Liman, J.) (“Chan”) (111-page \nopinion denying motions for preliminary injunction in four related cases challenging the program); \nsee also County of Rockland v. Metro. Transp. Auth., No. Civ. 24-3325 (2d Cir. Jan. 28, 2025), \nECF 31 (per curiam); New Jersey v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. Civ. 25-1033 (3d Cir. Jan. 4, 2025), \nECF 9 (Bibas, J.); County of Rockland v. Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., No. 24 Civ. 2285 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2025), ECF 56 (Seibel, J.); New Jersey v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. 23 Civ. \n3885 (D.N.J.

Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., No. 24 Civ. 3983 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, \n2024), ECF 44 (Seibel, J.).  In rejecting these plaintiffs’ requests for a preliminary injunction to \nhalt the Program, courts recognized that the equities and public interest favored the Program \nmoving forward, especially in light of the expenditures necessary to implement the Program and \nthe revenues expected from its operation, see, e.g., Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *48-49; that the \nimplementation of the Program reflected a policy choice by New York’s elected representatives, \nsee id. at *48; and that FHWA conducted a thorough analysis in deciding to allow the Program to \nproceed, see id. at *5-10; New Jersey, No. 23 Civ. 3885, ECF 212 at 35. \n  56   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 57 of 111\n \n131.  FHWA and USDOT were named as defendants in several of the above-referenced \ncases.  In the course of defending the Final EA and FONSI, and FHWA’s ultimate approval of the \nProgram, FHWA and USDOT submitted briefs to this Court and others that underscored and \nreiterated FHWA’s longstanding view that cordon pricing programs, including those with a \nrevenue objective, are permissible under the VPPP.   \n132.  In briefs before this Court, FHWA and USDOT described the VPPP as the “means \nby which the FHWA can provide tolling authority to state, regional, or local governments to \nimplement congestion pricing programs.”  Chan, ECF 65 at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThey  explained  that  it  was  appropriate  for  FHWA  to  authorize  a  cordon  pricing  program: \n“Although this may be the first time congestion pricing is applied to a city’s central business \ndistrict  (i.e.  ‘cordon  pricing’)  in  the  United  States,  such  projects  have  been  successfully \nimplemented in London, Stockholm, Singapore, and Milan, and information from some of those \nprojects was used to inform the analysis conducted here.”  Chan, ECF 81 at 10; see also id. \n(“[C]ongestion pricing strategies are not novel and the impacts of such strategies on driving \nbehavior, traffic volumes, transit ridership and air quality have been available for review for \nyears.”). \n133.  FHWA and USDOT recognized that the Program’s purpose is to “reduce traffic \ncongestion in the Manhattan CBD in a manner that will generate revenue for future transportation \nimprovements.”  Chan, ECF 65 at 9.  FHWA and USDOT went on to explain that compliance with \nthe TMA’s objective that the Program enable a minimum amount of funding for the MTA Capital \nProgram was not only an “appropriate” consideration in the NEPA process, but also “serves the \nseparation of powers by respecting the democratic legitimacy of legislative judgments,” “promotes \nthe balance of ‘federalism’ by ensuring that federal agencies do not pass judgment on the policy \n  57   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 58 of 111\n \nwisdom of state and local enactments,” and “is pragmatically sensible as well, since it ensures \nfederal agencies do not expend resources examining alternatives that the project sponsors are not \nlegally authorized to implement.” Chan, ECF 160 at 8 (quoting Mulgrew, 2024 WL 3251732, at \n*26). \n134.  One of the plaintiffs that sued to prevent implementation of the Program is, as \nnoted, the State of New Jersey, which sued USDOT and FHWA among others.  On December 30, \n2024, Judge Leo Gordon granted USDOT, FHWA, the MTA, and TBTA’s motions for summary \njudgment in overwhelming part, rejecting New Jersey’s claims that FHWA acted arbitrarily in \nassessing the potential adverse environmental impacts on New Jersey resulting from air pollution \nand identifying and assessing the potential for disproportionately high and adverse impacts on New \nJersey EJ communities.  New Jersey, No. 23 Civ. 3885, ECF 191.  New Jersey also raised concerns \nabout the adequacy of participation afforded to New Jersey entities, officials, and the public \nthroughout the process, and that FHWA had failed to conduct a transportation conformity analysis \nunder the Clean Air Act for the Project with regard to New Jersey’s State Implementation Plan, \nwhich claims the court also rejected.  The court reserved judgment on two issues that it remanded \nto FHWA for further explanation: the amount of place-based mitigation funding allocated to New \nJersey EJ communities to address the former EO 12,898 and the consideration of alternatives in \nlight of the adopted Phase-In Approach.  Id.  The court did not, as sought by New Jersey, vacate \nthe  FONSI  pending  the  completion  of  the  remand.    New  Jersey  subsequently  moved  for \nreconsideration and for a temporary restraining order, which the court denied.  FHWA filed its \nremand results on January 17, 2025, reaffirming the FONSI and Reevaluations, including with \nrespect to the alternatives analysis and the revenue objective.  The remand results are pending sub \njudice before the court. \n  58   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 59 of 111\n \n135.  On January 5, 2025, the Program went into effect.  Vehicles entering the CBD are \nbeing tolled at the rates established in the adopted toll rate schedule. \nF.  Data to Date Indicate that the Program Has Been Successful at Reducing Congestion \nand Is Increasingly Popular with New Yorkers \n136.  While the Program has only recently begun and its full benefits have yet to be \nrealized, it is clearly already working.  A recent study by researchers from the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research and Google Research concluded that the “introduction of congestion pricing \nled  to  an  immediate  increase  in  speeds  within  NYC’s  CBD,  which  has  persisted  since \nimplementation” and estimate “that speeds in NYC’s CBD increased by 15%” on average, and \nthat the “effects on speeds are even larger during the afternoon—historically the most congested \ntime of day—and persist even after peak-hours pricing ends at 9pm.”103  The researchers also found \nthat the Program “had positive spillovers on speeds throughout the NYC metropolitan area” and \nhad already led to a small, but noticeable decrease in emissions for vehicles driving in the CBD.104  \nEvery day there are close to 60,000 fewer cars in the CBD since tolling began.105  New Jerseyans \ndriving or commuting by bus are saving as much as 21 minutes on a daily round trip, while \ncommuters from Queens and Long Island are saving as much as 13 minutes.106  The Financial \nTimes has estimated that “motorists … will save thousands of hours per year they currently waste \ncrawling through smoggy tunnels or over clogged bridges.”107  This is already being borne out in \nthe first months since the Program took effect.  Crossing times were 17% faster at the Lincoln \n \n103 Cody Cook, et al., supra note 2 at 2.   \n104 Id. \n105 Michelle Kaske, NYC Toll Projected to Boost Economy by as much as $1.3 Billion, BLOOMBERG (Mar. 11, 2025), \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-11/nyc-toll-projected-to-boost-economy-by-as-much-as-1-3-\nbillion.  \n106 Id.    \n107 Oliver Roeder & Sam Learner, First US congestion pricing scheme brings dramatic drop in NY traffic, FINANCIAL \nTIMES (Jan. 16, 2025), https://www.ft.com/content/c229b603-3c6e-4a1c-bede-67df2d10d59f.  \n  59   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 60 of 111\n \nTunnel and 48% faster at the Holland Tunnel in January 2025, compared to January 2024; trip \ntimes from Brooklyn and Queens to the CBD have dropped between 10% and 30%, and express \nbuses save about 10 minutes on their commutes.108  Traffic speeds on river crossings have been \n5% to 30% faster this February than last February.109  Traffic speeds on major bridges improved \nsignificantly: on the Queensboro Bridge, by 31%; on the Brooklyn Bridge, by 26%; and on the \nManhattan Bridge, by 7%.110  Fewer vehicles use the nine MTA bridges and tunnels, with the \nlargest reductions at the Hugh L.

Reduced traffic, as a result of \nthe Program, has allowed more of these buses to make it to school on time. \n140.  At the same time, the fact that there are now fewer cars on the road in the CBD has \nnot stymied economic activity.  In fact, data provided by the MTA shows that in January 2025, \n35.8 million people visited BIDs in the CBD, a 1.5 million increase compared to last January.  \nCredit card sales data reflects that retail sales in the CBD have been $900 million higher in 2025 \ncompared to the same period last year.122  Credit card sales data reflects that retail sales in the CBD \nare on pace to be $900 million higher in 2025 compared to the same period last year.123   The gross \nrevenue of Broadway shows in January through March 2025 was 25% higher than in the same \nperiod of last year, while attendance at shows was approximately 20% higher in the first three \nmonths of 2025 compared to the same period of last year. 124  As Governor Hochul recently said, \n“traffic is down and business is up.”125 \n141.

Business leaders have continued to voice their support for the Program since its \nbenefits have truly started to emerge.  For example, Union Square Partnership Executive Director \nJulie Stein said that since the Program began, “average weekday foot traffic in Union Square has \nreached its highest levels for this season in recent history, surpassing both pre-pandemic and \nrecent-year benchmarks for January and February.”129  Stein added that people in the community \nare  saying  that  “Union  Square  feels  more  peaceful  and  pedestrian-friendly  and  surface \ntransportation commuting times into and out of the district have improved.”130  Hudson Square \nBID President and CEO Samara Karasyk said that, because of the Program, “[w]e have already \nseen a tangible decrease in traffic around the Holland Tunnel, which … will help grow the local \neconomy and enhance the vitality of our community.”131 \n \n126  New  York’s  Chamber  (@NYChamber),  X  (Nov.  15,  2024,  3:29  PM), \nhttps://x.com/NYChamber/status/1857521387583451602.  \n127 Dick Brennan, President Trump Said to Have NYC’s Congestion Pricing, Bike Lanes in his Crosshairs, CBS NEWS \n(Feb. 10, 2025), https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/president-trump-nyc-congestion-pricing-bike-lanes/.  \n128 Ry Rivard & Nick Reisman, New York’s Business Boosters Push Trump to Keep Manhattan Tolls, POLITICO (Feb. \n11, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/new-york-trump-congestion-pricing-00203540.  \n129 Traffic Down, Business Up, supra note 125. \n130 Id.  \n131 Id.  \n  63   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 64 of 111\n \n143.  Emergency vehicle speeds and response times obviously benefit from the reduction \nof traffic and lessening of congestion.  For many years, increasing traffic in New York City led to \nlonger and longer emergency vehicle response times.  As documented in a report issued by State \nSenator  Brad  Hoylman-Sigal,  who  represents  much  of  the  CBD,  and  traffic  engineer  Sam \nSchwartz, over the past decade, “E.M.S. response times to life-threatening situations had increased \nby 29%; for Fire Department vehicles tending to medical emergencies, the lag was up by 72 \npercent.”132  Congestion pricing allows emergency vehicles to respond more quickly to calls.  \n144.  Reports also indicate that the Program has made the streets safer; data compiled \nby the New York Police Department reflect decreases in accidents both inside and outside the \nCBD for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024.133  \n145.  Public transit ridership has seen an increase following the implementation of the \nProgram, with 448,000 more riders on average each day choosing to use MTA public transit \noptions as compared to the same period last year.134   \n146.  Crime in the subway has plummeted, even as ridership has increased.  In January \n2025, there were 36% fewer crimes reported on the subway than last January.135  Overall, subway \ncrime is down 22% so far in 2025.136 \n \n132 Ginia Bellfante, The Life-or-Death Consequences of Killing Congestion Pricing, N.Y.

Honking is also down, as New Yorkers in the CBD have actually enjoyed what \nmight be called peace and quiet since the Program went into effect.137  The two Department of \nEnvironmental Protection noise cameras in the CBD have not yet issued a single horn-honking \nsummons since the Program went into effect, whereas 27 were issued during the same time period \nlast year.138  There has also been a 69% decline in complaints about honking to the city’s 311 portal \nfrom citizens living inside the CBD for the same time frame in 2024.139  “Less congestion means \nless noise,” Jaqi Cohen, director of climate and equity policy for Tri-State Transportation Campaign \nexplained, “but I think horn honking is also a symptom of people’s frustration behind the wheel, so \nit probably speaks to the fact that people have easier commutes now.”140 \n148.  Not only has Congestion Pricing created all of these benefits for New Yorkers and \ncommuters, it has also met revenue raising expectations for the MTA’s Capital Program.141   \n149.  According to a poll reported by CBS News, the majority of New Yorkers want the \nProgram to continue,142 and polling indicates that support for the Program continues to grow as \ncommuters see its benefits.143  On a 2-to-1 basis, New Yorkers say that the program is working.144  \n \n137 Jose Martinez & Mia Hollie, Honking Complaints Plunge 69% Inside Congestion Pricing Zone, THE CITY (Mar. \n11, 2025), https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/03/11/traffic-noise-complaints-drop-congestion-pricing/.  \n138 Id.  \n139 Id.  \n140 Id. \n141 Barbara Russo-Lennon, Congestion Pricing: MTA Announces $51.9 Million in Manhattan Toll Revenue for \nFebruary, AMNY (Mar. 24, 2025), https://www.amny.com/news/congestion-pricing-revenue-tolls-february-2025/.  \n142Alecia Reid, 6 in 10 Say They Want NYC Congestion Pricing to Continue, New Poll Finds, CBS NEWS (Feb. 5, \n2025),  https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/newyork/news/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-morning-consult-poll/.  \nAnother poll, run close in time to the Program’s launch, likewise found that a majority of New Yorkers support \ncongestion pricing.

Congressman \nJerry Nadler has stated that “congestion pricing is the best — and only — solution to getting our \ntransit system back on track” and will allow the “MTA to advance work on the 2nd Avenue \nSubway extension, Penn Access, ADA accessibility upgrades, and more.  We will end the \ncongested streets that put public safety and emergency response at risk while meeting our climate \ngoals to fight the climate crisis.”145  Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine has also given his \nstrong support to the Program, stating: “Implementing congestion pricing as soon as possible will \nraise the critical funds we need to build elevators and escalators, modernize signals, and give New \nYorkers the transit system we deserve.”146  Assemblymember Tony Simone from Manhattan \nexpressed a similar sentiment: “There is not, has never been and never will be, a substitute for the \nfunding promised through congestion pricing.  Mass transit is the backbone of our city and state, \nwhich are the economic engine for the nation.  This funding is critical to making our system fully \naccessible, improving service, delivering the infrastructure to increase residential density to \ncombat the housing crisis, create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and induce billions of \ndollars of investment.”147  Elected representatives from boroughs outside of the CBD have also \nexpressed their support for the Program and the benefits it is already incurring.  State Senator \nRobert Jackson, who represents parts of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, stated that “Congestion \npricing is already delivering for New York—easing gridlock, cutting pollution, and powering \ncritical funding for our transit system.”148  Similarly, Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas, \n \n145 Gov.

Following its implementation, many New Yorkers have spoken out about the \nbenefits of the Program.  Walt “Clyde” Frazier, the legendary former point guard for the New York \nKnicks, declared his support for the Program during a recent Knicks game, commenting: “It’s like \ncongestion pricing, Mike, in the paint.  I’m loving the congestion pricing, there’s no traffic man, \nyou can get around now.”150  Nobel laureate and economist Paul Krugman, who lives in New York \nCity, describes the Program as “Economics 101” and has concluded that the Program “has been \nremarkably successful, exceeding even its supporters’ expectations.”151  Illena Robbins, who grew \nup in Manhattan and now lives in Queens, said in an interview with the New York Times that \ncrossing the street to get lunch “would stress me out,” but now that the Program is in effect, she is \n“able to cross safely, and cars weren’t honking.

On the day of President Trump’s Inauguration, January 20, 2025, New Jersey \nGovernor Phil Murphy made a personal appeal to end the Program.  In a letter to President Trump, \nGovernor Murphy noted the President’s previous characterization of congestion pricing as a \n“disaster” and vow to “TERMINATE” it on his “FIRST WEEK BACK in office!!!”164  \n160.

Similarly, Section 5(f)(iii) of the order requires projects to “mitigate the unique \nimpacts of DOT programs,” such as “the accessibility of transportation to families with young \nchildren.”  The Program meets these goals by generating revenues to install elevators at subway \nstations, improving pedestrian and cyclist safety, and reducing gridlock to improve travel time \nreliability, thereby increasing transportation options for families with young children, while also \nreducing vehicular emissions and financing significant environmental mitigation measures to \nenhance their health.  \n162.  On February 19, 2025, USDOT followed through on the President’s promise to \nattempt to “terminate” congestion pricing by undertaking agency action purporting to rescind the \nVPPP Agreement and revoke federal approval for the Program.   In a letter addressed to Governor \nHochul, Duffy explained that he had been directed by President Trump to “review[] the tolling \nauthority granted under VPPP to the Program pilot project for compliance with Federal law” and \nhad “concluded that the scope of this pilot project as approved exceeds the authority authorized by \nCongress under VPPP.”  Duffy Ltr. at 2.  The letter goes on to state, without citation to any statutory \nor regulatory authority that would purport to authorize such a decision, that Duffy had chosen to \n“rescind[] FHWA’s approval of the [Program] under the [VPPP Agreement] and terminat[e] the \nAgreement.”  Id. \n \n165 U.S. DEP’T OF TRANSP., Signed DOT Order re: Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic Analysis in Department \nof  Transportation  Policies  Programs  and  Activities  (Jan.  29,  2025),  https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-\nroom/signed-dot-order-re-ensuring-reliance-upon-sound-economic-analysis-department  \n  72   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 73 of 111\n \n163.  Although the Duffy Letter claims that he chose to “terminate” the Program on legal \ngrounds arising from his interpretation of the VPPP, the majority of the letter is instead focused on \nreciting Duffy’s policy disagreements with the Program.  For example, Duffy complains that the \nProgram is not “a fair deal” for “working class Americans” because it imposes an additional \nfinancial burden on drivers—while failing to acknowledge that TBTA provides a substantial \ndiscount plan on Program tolls for low-income drivers and benefits them by reducing driving time.  \nId.166  The letter also cites New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s “significant concerns” about the \nProgram and its effects on New Jersey residents, but overlooks that the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey has already largely rejected Governor Murphy’s challenges to the Program \nand that the principal New Jersey challenge was based on EO 12,898, which President Trump has \nnow withdrawn.  Id.; see supra ¶ 134. \n164.  To the extent the Duffy Letter attempts to proffer various legal bases purportedly \nunderpinning Duffy’s decision, its conclusory analysis is cursory and unfounded.  Duffy first \nclaims that he is “require[d] to narrowly construe” the VPPP because it operates as an “exception” \nto 23 U.S.C. § 301 which, as noted above, generally restricts tolling on federal-aid highways—a \nrestriction to which there are many broad statutory exceptions, as described supra.  Duffy Ltr. at 3.  \nDrawing on this faulty, unprecedented, and overly narrow approach to construing the VPPP, Duffy \nthen seeks to justify his decision to rescind FHWA’s approval of the Program on two grounds.   \n165.  First, he notes the Program “uses a method of tolling known as ‘cordon pricing,’” \nand claims that “FHWA has never before approved a VPPP program that uses cordon pricing.”  \nDuffy Ltr. at 3; but see supra ¶¶ 80, 86, 90, 92 (collecting cordon pricing projects funded by \n \n166 See METRO. TRANSP. AUTH., Congestion Relief Zone Toll: Discounts and Exemptions, \nhttps://www.mta.info/fares-tolls/tolls/congestion-relief-zone/discounts-exemptions (last visited Mar. 27, 2025). \n  73   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 74 of 111\n \nFHWA under the VPPP).  Without any analysis of the text of the VPPP or its accompanying \nlegislative history, and without acknowledging FHWA’s long history of endorsing cordon pricing \nas a value pricing strategy and funding cordon pricing projects under the VPPP, Duffy summarily \nconcludes that “no statute contemplates cordon pricing in a situation where tolls are inescapable.”  \nDuffy Ltr. at 3.   \n166.  Second, Duffy objects that “imposition of tolls under the [Program] appears to be \ndriven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) \nsystem as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  Id.  While Duffy concedes, as he must, that \n“revenue generation is a necessary outcome of any congestion pricing scheme and specifically \nallowable under the VPPP statute,” and that under the VPPP revenue used to “improv[e] the transit \nsystem may eventually affect roadway congestion,” he nonetheless concludes—again, without any \nanalysis of the statutory text—that the “VPPP does not authorize tolls that are calculated based on \nconsiderations separate from reducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.”  Id.  \n167.  The legal justifications offered by Duffy for his decision to “terminate” federal \napproval of the Program are wholly without merit.  There is no truth to the claim that the VPPP \nmust be narrowly construed because it is an “exception” to 23 U.S.C. § 301.  For one thing, the \nonly express exception to Section 301 is Section 129, which broadly sets forth a bevy of ways in \nwhich the federal government may participate in tolled highways.  See 23 U.S.C. § 301 (“Except \nas  provided  in  Section  129…”);  id.  §  129  (setting  forth  various  programs  for  government \nparticipation).  The VPPP, on the other hand, is an additional, stand-alone program that Congress \ncreated for project sponsors to consider potential “value pricing pilot programs,” in which the \nSecretary “shall solicit” participation.  VPPP, cl. 1.  And in all events, the Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly held that exceptions should be interpreted in the same manner as any other statute, \n  74   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 75 of 111\n \nexplaining that “[e]xceptions and exemptions are no less part of Congress’s work than its rules and \nstandards” and courts “have no right to place our thumbs on one side of the scale or the other.”  \nBP p.l.c. v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, 141 S. Ct. 1532, 1538-39 (2021) (rejecting \nargument that Court must construe exceptions narrowly and explaining that courts have “no license \nto give statutory exemptions anything but a fair reading”); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 359 (2012) (rejecting the “false notion” \nthat “tax exemptions—or any other exemptions for this matter—should be strictly construed”).   \n168.  Duffy’s claim that the VPPP does not permit congestion pricing projects that \nemploy cordon pricing finds no support in the VPPP, which does not purport to limit the type of \n“congestion pricing pilot programs,” later renamed “value pricing pilot programs,” that States may \nimplement.  VPPP, cl. 1.  The legislative history establishes that, in enacting ISTEA, Congress \nanticipated that States could implement cordon-based tolling, see supra ¶¶ 70-74, and FHWA \ninformed Congress in testimony, shortly after ISTEA was enacted, that FHWA interpreted the \nstatute to authorize a wide range of congestion pricing strategies, “ranging from pricing on a new \nor existing single road facility to more comprehensive area-wide road pricing strategies,” supra \n¶ 75 (emphasis added).  In the years since 1991 when ISTEA was enacted, FHWA has repeatedly \nstated that the VPPP permits cordon pricing in official agency publications, notices in the Federal \nRegister, guidance documents, reports to Congress, and other materials.  See supra ¶¶ 75, 77-79, \n82, 87-89, 91, 96.  To this day, FHWA’s website includes “Cordon Tolls” among the list of \npermissible “Project Types/Projects” available to States through the VPPP.  Supra ¶ 96.  Consistent \nwith this understanding, FHWA has many times endorsed cordon pricing and awarded funds to \nproject sponsors under the VPPP to study cordon pricing projects.  See supra ¶ 84, 86-98.  And \nFHWA has repeatedly concluded that the VPPP authorized cordon pricing in New York City, \n  75   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 76 of 111\n \nwhen FHWA, during President Trump’s first term, informed the Project Sponsors that the VPPP \nwas the “best fit” for the Program, and more recently when FHWA executed the VPPP Agreement \nauthorizing tolling under the Program.  Supra ¶¶ 9.  Congress has long been aware of FHWA’s \ninterpretation of the VPPP as permitting cordon pricing, based on FHWA’s congressional reports \nand testimony, and has never sought to amend the VPPP to prohibit cordon pricing projects despite \namending other portions of the VPPP over the years.  See supra ¶ 85. \n169.  Duffy’s position that cordon tolling can only be authorized under a separate \nstatutory provision, 23 U.S.C. § 129(d), authorizing FHWA to approve congestion pricing on \nInterstate system roads, and only in situations where “drivers can choose a non-Interstate route,” \nDuffy Ltr. at 3, is nonsensical.  The entire point of cordon-based tolling, as reflected in the \nlongstanding understanding in the Congressional record and FHWA statements, is to eliminate \ntoll-free routes as the best means of alleviating congestion within a specific geographic area, \nespecially an urban area.  See supra at ¶¶ 84-85, 89.  And indeed, FHWA has funded studies of \ntrue cordon toll policies under the VPPP, and another such program is still under review for VPPP \ntolling authorization.  See supra at ¶¶ 86, 90, 92, 95. \n170.  Duffy’s letter is also factually incorrect in claiming that “the imposition of tolls \nunder the CBDTP pilot project appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the \nMetropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) system as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  \nDuffy Ltr. at 3.  As explained supra, revenue generation to support public transit as a non-driving \noption has always been a complementary objective, and of no greater importance than the primary \ngoal of reducing congestion in the CBD, which transit improvements funded through toll revenues \nwill also support.  This aspect of Duffy’s “reasoning” simply ignores the record before FHWA \nsupporting its execution of the VPPP in 2024.  \n  76   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 77 of 111\n \n171.  Equally spurious is Duffy’s claim that project sponsors may not consider revenue \nobjectives when setting toll rates under VPPP-authorized tolling programs.  The VPPP contains \nno such prohibition and, to the contrary, expressly contemplates that project sponsors will use toll \n“[r]evenues generated by any pilot project” to fund other “projects eligible under such title”—\nwhich include capital transit projects eligible for federal assistance.  VPPP, cl. 3.  The statute also \nprovides that the Secretary must periodically report on the effects of VPPP projects, on not only \ncongestion but also on “transit ridership … and availability of funds for transportation programs.”  \nId. cl. 5.  As Congress noted at the time, the purpose of the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program was, \namong other things, to study the effects of such programs on “the availability of funds for \ntransportation programs.”  S. Rep. No. 102-71, 26 (1991).  Indeed, far from prohibiting project \nsponsors from considering revenue, a different section of ISTEA required project sponsors to \nconsider “the use of innovative mechanisms for financing [transportation] projects, including … \ncongestion pricing.”  ISTEA § 1025(a).  As detailed above, FHWA has repeatedly stated in official \nreports and guidance documents that revenues from congestion pricing “can be used to pay for \nexpansion of roadway facilities or to support alternatives to driving alone, such as public transit.”  \nSupra ¶ 88; see also supra ¶¶ 89, 91, 93, 96-98.  And FHWA’s website reinforces this position, \nstating that “DOT believes that using innovating financing strategies to leverage limited public \ntransportation revenue is integral to the long-term re-thinking of how the United States provides \nhighway and transit infrastructure,” one such strategy being congestion pricing.  Supra ¶ 97. \n172.  In the weeks since issuing the Duffy Letter, Duffy has made several statements in \nthe press that misstate easily verifiable aspects of the Program, suggesting that he may have \nreached his decision, reversing longstanding FHWA legal interpretation and policy, without \nconsidering relevant information.  \n  77   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 78 of 111\n \n173.  On February 19, 2025, after issuing the Duffy Letter, Duffy gave an interview with \nCBS Evening News in which he incorrectly stated that Governor Hochul “never did a study to say, \n‘I really care about congestion and I want to reduce congestion, so I’m going to look at how much \nmoney should I charge in a toll and how much will that reduce Congestion?’ That analysis was \nnever done.”167  In fact, the Project Sponsors prepared, and FHWA approved, detailed analyses of \nthe impact of different potential toll rate schedules ranging “from approximately $9 to $23 during \npeak hours and $5 to $12 during off-peak hours” on VMT and traffic congestion in the CBD in \nconnection with the FHWA’s NEPA analysis.  Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 750 F. Supp. 3d \n171,  224  (S.D.N.Y.  2024)  (Liman,  J.);  see  also  Reevaluation  2  at  8, \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/158191.    That  analysis  considered  whether  various  tolling \nscenarios could achieve objectives to reduce VMT within and the number of vehicles entering the \nCBD by 5% and 10%, respectively.  The same analysis was conducted in the Reevaluations to \nensure that the ultimately approved tolling structure would achieve these congestion-reduction \nobjectives foundational to the purpose of the Program as articulated in the Final EA. \n174.  On March 4, 2025, in an interview with Fox News, Duffy again falsely claimed that \nthere had been no analysis of the effect of the Program toll schedule on congestion, stating: “if we \ncharge this much money … this much less congestion.  That study was never done.  This is just \nabout raising money for public transportation, and that’s why we are fighting it.”  As noted above, \nthe Project Sponsors prepared, and FHWA approved, exactly such a study. \n175.  On March 31, 2025, Duffy posted on X: “Taxpayers already paid for New York \nCity’s Roads, but NY wants to charge them AGAIN to use them.  $9 in, $9 out, with no free \n \n167 Matt Troutman, Trump’s Transportation Secretary 100% Open to Some Form of NYC Congestion Pricing After \nPresident Declared Tolls ‘Dead’, NY POST (Feb. 21, 2025), https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/us-news/trumps-\ntransportation-secretary-floats-some-form-of-nyc-congestion-pricing/. \n  78   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 79 of 111\n \nalternative.”  Again, this statement reflects Duffy’s apparent lack of understanding as to basic \naspects of the Program.  The Program only charges vehicles upon entry into the CBD and there is \nno second charge for exiting the CBD.  Under the Program’s toll rate schedule, passenger vehicles \ncan only be charged a maximum of once per day for entry into the CBD.  See Phase-In Approach \nToll Rate Schedule, https://www.mta.info/document/138931.  \nFigure 12: Mar. 31, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n176.  That same day, February 19, 2025, Duffy released a press statement announcing \nthat FHWA had “terminated approval of the pilot for New York’s Central Business District Tolling \nProgram,” in which he described the Program as a “slap in the face to working class Americans \n  79   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 80 of 111\n \nand small business owners,” and “backwards and unfair.”168  However, the same analysis that was \nundertaken by the Project Sponsors and approved by FHWA looked at the projected economic \nimpact of the Program and considered whether residents or businesses would be forced to move \nor whether there would be changes in economic conditions leading to a loss or substantial \ndiminishment of products and services.  Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *6.  Their analysis concluded \nthat the Program “would provide an economic benefit” to the CBD and “would not be likely to \nresult in the involuntary displacement of residents, business, or employees.” Id. at *7.  And as \nnoted above, the Program has actually already had a positive impact on business. \nI.  Plaintiffs Bring Suit Seeking a Declaratory Judgment that the Duffy Letter is Null \nand Void, and Defendants Attempt to Coerce Compliance by Threatening to Illegally \nWithhold Federal Funding \n177.  When the Administration finally attempted to “terminate” the Program on February \n19, 2025, after repeatedly threatening to do so in the press, Plaintiffs immediately commenced the \ninstant lawsuit.  In their original complaint, filed that same day, Plaintiffs alleged that the Duffy \nLetter was legally invalid and unenforceable and sought a declaratory judgment that the VPPP \nAgreement remained in effect.  In light of the rights granted to TBTA by the VPPP Agreement, \nthe irreparable harm that ending the Program would cause for the MTA, TBTA, and the people of \nNew York, and the clear deficiencies in the Duffy Letter’s rationales, Plaintiffs stated that they \nwould “continue to operate the Program as required by New York law until and unless Plaintiffs \nare directed to stop by a court order.”  ECF 1, ¶¶ 25, 120. \n \n168 Press Release, U.S. DEP’T OF TRANSP., U.S. Department of Transportation Terminates Tolling Approval for New \nYork City’s Cordon Pricing Program (Feb. 19, 2025), https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/us-department-\ntransportation-terminates-tolling-approval-new-york-citys-cordon-pricing. \n  80   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 81 of 111\n \n178.

Almost immediately upon release of the Duffy Letter, legal scholars and public \ncommentators questioned its validity and noted that it was unlikely to be enforced by the courts.  \nDavid A. Super, a professor at Georgetown Law, told the New York Times that Duffy did not have \nauthority to rescind federal approval of the Program, explaining: “There is really nothing in the \nstatute that gives the secretary authority to stop these things.”169  Robert L. Glicksman, a professor \nat George Washington University Law School, likewise questioned Defendants’ authority, noting \nthat simply “[d]eclaring ‘I’m the king’ is not sufficient grounds for reversing [federal approval of \nthe Program].”170  Noah Kazis, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, \ncalled the Administration’s move a “political wrecking ball” that disregards the law.171  Even \nsupporters of the Administration’s efforts to end the Program questioned the reasoning of the Duffy \nLetter, noting that it appeared to be “based on sloppy analysis and statutory triangulation.”172 \n182.  Faced with these obstacles, the Administration resorted to what has become its \nmodus operandi: attempting to improperly leverage federal funding as a way to compel compliance \nwith its unlawful decrees.  On March 18, 2025, Duffy sent a letter to the MTA (“March 18 Safety \nLetter”), Exhibit D, demanding detailed information on crime and safety in subways and on buses \nin New York City, and threatening “further consequences, up to and including redirecting or \nwithholding funding.”  Although the letter did not directly reference the Program, it was widely \nperceived, coming just three days before the then-deadline Defendants had set for the Program to \n \n169 Tracey Tully, Why Trump’s Push to Kill Congestion Pricing Might Fail, N.Y.

Significantly, Duffy’s March 18 demand for information differed materially from \na similar letter to the D.C. Metro system, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \n(“WMATA”),  on  March  6,  2025.    While  the  WMATA  letter  also  requested  subway  safety \ninformation, it did not include the same threat of redirecting or withholding federal funding as in \nthe letter to the MTA.  In his letter to the Chief Executive Officer of WMATA, Duffy similarly \nrequested WMATA’s plans to reduce crime and fare evasion and information about WMATA’s \nbudget,  but  stated  only  that  WMATA  “should  target  federal  resources  expeditiously  and \nappropriately for” eligible federal crime prevention and security activities.   \n184.  On March 19, 2025, WMATA responded to Duffy with their crime statistics and \ntheir planned budget increases for additional safety-related investments.

Duffy’s March 18 demand for information also differed materially from a letter he \nsent to Stephen J. Gardner, the Chief Executive Officer of Amtrak on March 6, 2025.  While the \nAmtrak letter also emphasized the importance of addressing security and preventing crime at \nWashington Union Station, the letter did not request a response or levy any threats.  Instead in his \nletter, Duffy simply stated that “[i]n the short term, Amtrak must work closely with [Union Station \nRedevelopment Corporation] to prioritize station projects that benefit all station users, including \nsecurity, lighting, and other immediate improvements that support maintenance and beautification \nof the station,” and in “[i]n the longer term, Amtrak must continue to coordinate with [Union \nStation Redevelopment Corporation], the Project sponsor for the Station Expansion Project.”  \nThus, only the letter addressed to the MTA contained the threat that federal funding may be \nwithheld.  \n186.  On March 20, 2025, the day before the deadline Defendants had set for the Program \nto cease tolling, Duffy posted to X, without prior notice to Plaintiffs, an apparent warning that \nDefendants will illegally withhold federal funding from the State of New York (and, by implication, \n  85   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 86 of 111\n \nfrom the MTA, TBTA, and NYSDOT), just as the Trump Administration has done recently in \ncountless other recent cases, unless Plaintiffs agree to end the Program.  Disregarding the fact that \nthe validity of the Duffy Letter is the subject of litigation before this Court, Duffy warned: “the \nfederal government and @POTUS are putting New York on notice” that “refusal to end cordon \npricing and your open disrespect towards the federal government is unacceptable.”  Expressly \ndrawing the connection between the current litigation and federal funding, he continued: “Know \nthat the billions of dollars the federal government sends to New York are not a blank check.  \nContinued noncompliance will not be taken lightly.”  Finally, Duffy purported to grant Plaintiffs a \n“30-day extension” to cease tolling.   \n \nFigure 2: Mar. 20, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n187.  On March 20, 2025, Defendant Shepherd sent a letter to NYSDOT, NYCDOT, and \nMTA  Bridges  and  Tunnels  [TBTA]  (the  “March  20  Shepherd  Letter”  or  “Mar.  20  Ltr.”), \nExhibit E, in which Shepherd notes her prior correspondence “providing you until March 21, \n  86   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 87 of 111\n \n2025, to cease tolling operations that were initiated through the November 21, 2024, Value Pricing \nPilot Program (VPPP) Agreement,” states that Duffy “has directed that I extend the period of time \nto comply by 30 days,” and instructs that “toll operations must cease by April 20, 2025.”  Mar. 20 \nLtr. \n188.  On March 23, 2025, Duffy gave an interview with Governor Murphy, in which \nDuffy described the New York subways system using an expletive, stating: “If you want people to \ntake the train, to take transit, then make it safe, make it clean, make it beautiful, make it wonderful, \ndon’t make it a s--- h---, which is what she [Governor Hochul] has done.”174   \n189.  On March 25, 2025, Duffy again took to X to threaten federal funding to the MTA \nin response to a letter from Governor Hochul, State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-\nCousins, and State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie proposing an update to the federal transit \nfunding formula, which awards the MTA only 17% of transit funding, despite its carrying 43% of \nthe nation’s mass transit riders.  Duffy described the proposal as “Outrageous!” and accused the \nState of “trying to fill the gap with highway funds and taxing the working class”—an apparent \nreference to the Program, which opponents often incorrectly refer to as a “tax”—rather than \n“actually fixing their financial mismanagement.”175  Using the same language from his March 20 \nX post demanding that New York end the Program, Duffy once again warned that “[t]he federal \ngovernment is not a blank check.” \n \n174 Larry Higgs, U.S. Transportation Boss Trashes NYC Subway, Proposes a Fix, NJ.com (Mar. 23, 2025), \nhttps://www.nj.com/news/2025/03/us-transportation-boss-trashes-nyc-subway-proposes-a-fix.html.  \n175 Indeed, if the toll were a “tax,” federal approval for tolling would not be required in the first place. \n  87   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 88 of 111\n \n \nFigure 3: Mar. 25, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n190.  On March 30, 2025 in a detailed, 22-page letter, attached hereto as Exhibit I \n(“MTA Resp.”), the MTA provided the requested information on subway crime to Duffy showing \nthat the MTA operates one of the safest transit systems in America, that crime in the NYC subway \nsystem is among the lowest it has been in the last 30 years, and that the MTA has committed more \nthan 20 times the minimum requirement in safety grant standards to keeping the system safe.  MTA \nResp. at 9-11.  The MTA’s response explained in detail that felonies in the subway system have \nfallen over the last 30 years, with a 79% decrease in robberies and a 67% decrease in grand \nlarcenies.  Id. at 10-11.  In the first two months of 2025, crime was 47% lower in the subway \nsystem than in the first two months of 2020 before COVID-19.  Id. at 10.  The MTA also \nhighlighted that felony assaults were down 7% in the first two months of 2025 compared to the \nsame time frame in 2024, but acknowledged that this was up 11% from the first two months in \n  88   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 89 of 111\n \n2020.  Id. at 2, 11.  The MTA further explained that this increase in felony assaults in recent years \nis driven by three causes: (1) “increased enforcement of fare compliance and quality-of-life \noffenses,” which is correlated with “increased [felony] assaults on NYPD officers who are \npatrolling the system in larger numbers,” id. at 11; (2) the “MTA’s ongoing and successful efforts \nover the last 20 years to amend the NYS Penal Law to classify aggressions committed against \ntransit workers as felonies,” id. at 6; and (3) enhanced public safety campaigns, which are \nassociated with “higher rates of reporting,” id. at 11.  Over just the last two years, total arrests in \nthe subway system were up 158%, significantly outpacing the increase in assaults, which were up \nby 4% from 2022 to 2024, even as the overall number of felonies continued to fall. \n191.  Despite the fact that the MTA is a safer transit system than WMATA, as WMATA \nriders are 3 times more likely than New York City transit riders to be victims of assaults on a per \ntrip basis, see id. at 2, Duffy has not issued a post, as he did in response to WMATA, to commend \nthe MTA for their commitment to safety.  Instead, the day after receiving the MTA’s response \nletter, Duffy posted to X that “[f]elony transit assaults on NYC subways are up 56% from 2019.”   \nThis comment completely misrepresented the safety information provided by the MTA and \ndisregards the MTA’s explanation that more felonies are being reported because of additional \npolicing measures and increased legal protections for subway and bus employees.  Specifically, as \nMTA explained in its response to Duffy, the increase in felony assaults is largely a result of the \npattern of increased assaults on NYPD officers as those officers have been patrolling the system \nin greater numbers and enforcing quality-of-life offenses; amendments to the New York State \nPenal Law to provide greater protections to transit workers from assault; and enhanced public \nsafety awareness campaigns.  Id. at 6, 11. \n  89   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 90 of 111\n \nFigure 15: Mar. 31, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n192.  On April 4, 2025, Duffy invited members of the press to join him on the New York \nsubway system and attempted to draw a connection between congestion pricing and subway crime, \nnotwithstanding that subway crime is at a historic low and the two issues bear little relation.  \nSpecifically, Duffy stated: “If they’re going to charge people to drive on roads, they need to offer \na better, safer subway system.”176  He also claimed: “The governor is forcing people into the train \nsystem, into the MTA, because she’s priced them out of using these roads.  That’s fundamentally \nunfair.” \n193.  On  April  15,  2025,  Duffy  came  across  a  violent  incident  while  visiting  the \nWMATA subway system involving a police officer who had been stabbed in the face by a man \nattempting to fare evade.177  Notably, while Duffy’s statements after the event discussed the \ngeneral need to “re-secure our transit systems” and address crime, he stopped short of directly \ncriticizing the WMATA for the incident.  This treatment of the WMATA—which is less safe as a \nsystem than the MTA—stands in contrast to Duffy’s frequent and harsh criticisms of the MTA, \n \n176 Linda Schmidt, Transportation Secretary Rides NYC Subway, Calls Conditions Unsafe as Federal Funding \nHangs in the Balance, Fox 5 (Apr. 4, 2025), https://www.fox5ny.com/news/transportation-secretary-rides-nyc-\nsubway-calls-conditions-unsafe-federal-funding-hangs-balance.  \n177 Andrea Margolis, DC Transit Police Officer Stabbed at Train Station as Sec. Sean Duffy Arrives to Talk Safety, \nFOX NEWS (Apr. 15, 2025), https://www.foxnews.com/us/dc-transit-police-officer-stabbed-train-station-sec-sean-\nduffy-arrives-talk-safety.  \n  90   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 91 of 111\n \nwhich he described as a “s--- h---” just days earlier, further emphasizing that Duffy’s alleged \nconcerns for subways safety are merely a pretext for pressuring Plaintiffs to stop the Program. \nJ.  The MTA, TBTA, and the Region’s Economy and Public Transit System Will be \nIrreparably Harmed if Plaintiffs are Forced to End the Program  \n194.  TBTA budgeted over $500 million to establish the Program, and much of the \nbudget was expended in advance of implementation.  These expenditures included developing the \nmethodological approach; conducting the assessment and extensive outreach and developing the \nfinal documentation for the environmental review process under NEPA; design, development, \nimplementation and testing of the roadway infrastructure and system; design, development, \nimplementation and testing of the Back Office System; additional extensive outreach for the State \nadministrative review process; staff costs, including new staff for the Program; and consulting \ncosts.   \n195.  If TBTA is unlawfully prevented from proceeding with the Program, it will incur \nroughly $12 million in additional expenditures per month, most of which would be related to a \ncombination of the operations and maintenance of the roadside tolling system, the operations of \nthe back-office system and Customer Contact Center, and consultant costs.  This figure does not \ninclude the costs related to additional staff that were brought on specifically for the Program nor \nother costs, such as those related to outreach and advertising and assessments to be undertaken for \nthe Program.  These costs cannot be deferred pending litigation over the legality of the Duffy \nLetter. \n196.  Any pause in the Program would also cause TBTA to lose estimated monthly \nrevenues in the first phase of the Program of over $40 million, based on projected net annual \nrevenues of roughly $500 million during that period. \n  91   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 92 of 111\n \n197.  Furthermore,  a  pause  in  the  Program  would  result  in  increased  traffic  and \ncongestion, which will lengthen travel times for bus operations and reduce public transit ridership. \n198.  Stopping the Program would also prevent the MTA, the end recipient of Program \nrevenues, from proceeding with vitally important work under the Capital Program, which is \nintended to ensure that improvements put in place will be sustainable for years to come.  The \nCapital Program identifies $52 billion of critical investments in the region’s subways, buses, and \ncommuter railroads, nearly one-third of which would be supported by the Program.   \n199.  New York’s economy, and therefore the nation’s economy, depends on keeping \nNew York moving.  In practical terms, that means funding the Capital Program, which is much \nneeded and cannot be further delayed.  As Janno Lieber, the MTA Chair and CEO, explained: \n“Concrete and steel, you poke holes in it, subject it to water and chemicals and salt for 100 years, \nit’s going to give out.”  The reason the State’s elected representatives chose Congestion Pricing \nwas, again, because it is simply the best solution to promote speed and convenience in the nation’s \n(and North America’s) largest transportation system. \n200.  Critical parts of the Capital Program would be delayed if Program tolling revenues \nare halted.  The Capital Program includes: (1) adding accessibility improvements (including \nelevators) to numerous subway stations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, by \nmaking at least 70 more subway systems accessible through building new elevators at 70 stations \nin all of the boroughs and replacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators, and finally bringing the \ntransportation system to greater than 50% accessibility; (2) improving outdated signaling, by \ndoubling the number of track lines with modernized signals; (3) purchasing over 1,900 new rail \ncars, which are six times more reliable than older ones, and replacing 2,400 buses; (4) replacing \n  92   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 93 of 111\n \napproximately 60 miles of track; and (5) renewing stations and addressing critical repair projects \nat 175 stations.  \n201.  The Capital Program will also provide much-needed repairs to Grand Central \nTerminal, a more than 100-year-old structure that is used by more than 700 trains a day.  And \ncoupled with funding from the 2015-2019 program, the Capital Program further provides funding \nfor three new fully accessible stations on the Second Avenue Subway that would allow connection \nto the Metro-North lines, strengthening connections for Harlem and East Harlem residents.  \n202.  New Yorkers, through the Capital Program, will also receive better access to Penn \nStation through a new route with four new stations on the Metro-North New Haven Line that will \ncarry up to 50,000 Metro-North customers directly to Penn Station every day.  \n203.  TBTA has incurred debt that it will rely on Program revenues to repay.  This \nincludes $378.8 million in short-term notes that were previously issued and currently outstanding \nto fund infrastructure costs and $500 million in short-term notes to fund a portion of the $15 billion \nof capital projects in the MTA’s Capital Program. \n204.  Finally, ending the Program means making life worse for millions of New Yorkers \nthrough a return to severe congestion in the CBD, with its concomitant economic, environmental, \nand public health and safety costs to businesses, residents, commuters, workers, and visitors in this \narea, without any evaluation of these and other environmental impacts, opportunity for public \nparticipation, or consideration of alternatives required by NEPA.   \n205.  Plaintiffs will continue to operate the Program as required by New York law unless \nand until Plaintiffs are directed to stop by a court order.   \n206.  Based on the foregoing, there is an actual controversy within the jurisdiction of this \nCourt under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n  93   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 94 of 111\n \nCAUSES OF ACTION  \nCOUNT I \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Substantively Arbitrary & Capricious – In Excess of Statutory Authority) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n207.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n208.  The acts of all executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, and in case \nan official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have jurisdiction to \ngrant relief.”  Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 108 (1902).  \n209.  Further, under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity,” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(B)-(C).  \n210.  Defendants  are  not  authorized  by  any  law—statutory  or  constitutional—to \nunilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement.  The VPPP Agreement is a valid agreement, currently \nin effect, supported by consideration, and subject to considerable reliance interests.  Neither ISTEA \nnor the VPPP Agreement authorizes FHWA to unilaterally rescind the VPPP Agreement, which \nconfers federal tolling authority under Section 1012(b) of ISTEA, as amended. \n211.  ISTEA does not include any provision authorizing FHWA to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement.  ISTEA authorizes the Secretary to “enter into” agreements “to establish, maintain, and \nmonitor” value pricing pilot programs.  ISTEA § 1012(b).  ISTEA further directs that the Secretary \nshall “monitor the effect of such programs for a period of at least 10 years.”  Id. at § 1012(b)(5). \n  94   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 95 of 111\n \n212.  The  VPPP  Agreement  does  not  include  any  provision  authorizing  FHWA  to \nterminate the agreement.  Rather, the VPPP Agreement contemplates that only TBTA could \nunilaterally decide to discontinue the Program, requiring the Project Sponsors to “work with FHWA \nto return the Project to its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the \nProject.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 11.  The VPPP Agreement further provides that TBTA and NYCDOT \nshall “monitor and report on the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the \nend of the life of the Project, whichever is sooner.”  Id., cl. (8)(b). \n213.  The VPPP Agreement references FHWA regulations at 23 C.F.R. Part 940 and 950.  \nThese regulations do not grant FHWA authority to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement, and \nthe FHWA has acted ultra vires. \n214.  An executive officer acts ultra vires where it “deprives a contractor of a right \nexpressly or impliedly granted by another statute.”  Chamber of Com. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 \n(D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n215.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of rights expressly and impliedly granted by \nISTEA § 1012(b), which permits tolling of federally funded highways following approval of a \nVPPP Project.  \n216.  Defendants have no authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement or rescind TBTA’s \nauthority to operate the Program.  Therefore, Defendants have acted in excess of authority and the \nDuffy Letter is arbitrary and capricious and must be declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside.  \nCOUNT II \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Substantively Arbitrary & Capricious – Contrary to Law) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n217.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \n  95   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 96 of 111\n \nforth fully herein.   \n218.  The acts of all executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, and in case \nan official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have jurisdiction to \ngrant relief.”  McAnnulty, 187 U.S. at 108.  \n219.  Further, under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n220.  Defendants’ purported basis to terminate the VPPP Agreement—broadly, that the \nProgram “is not an eligible ‘value pricing pilot program’” and thus “FHWA lacked statutory \nauthority to approve” the Program, Duffy Ltr. at 3—finds no support in the statutory text, legislative \nhistory, or FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of the VPPP, and is “not in accordance with law.” \n221.  The Duffy Letter states two main rationales for Defendants’ conclusion that the \nProgram is not an eligible VPPP project.  First, without any analysis of the statutory text, legislative \nhistory, or FHWA’s long history of endorsing cordon pricing as a value pricing strategy, Defendant \nDuffy summarily concludes that “no statute contemplates cordon pricing in a situation where tolls \nare inescapable.”  Id.  Second, again without any analysis of the actual statute or its history, Duffy \nobjects that “imposition of tolls under the [Program] appears to be driven primarily by the need to \nraise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) system as opposed to the need to \nreduce congestion.”  Id.  Both rationales are incorrect as a matter of fact and law.  \n222.  Cordon pricing projects are authorized under the VPPP.  Specifically, the VPPP \nauthorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter into cooperative agreements with State and local \ngovernments to implement “value pricing pilot programs.”  VPPP, cl. 1.  The statute does not define \n“value pricing pilot programs” or otherwise provide guidelines or restrictions on the kinds of \n  96   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 97 of 111\n \nprojects that are eligible under the statute.  The legislative history reflects Congress’s intent to \nauthorize a variety of innovative projects, including those that use cordon-based tolling and “area-\nwide road pricing strategies.”  And cordon-based or area-wide pricing projects have received \nfederal funding pursuant to the VPPP, not to mention the tolling authority actually approved for the \nProgram under the VPPP Agreement itself.   \n223.  Moreover, it is untrue that the primary driver of the Program is revenue generation.  \nThe record is clear that generation of revenue to improve public transit is complementary to the \nprimary purpose of congestion reduction. \n224.  In any event, raising revenue to fund the MTA’s Capital Program is clearly \nauthorized under the VPPP.  For one, the statutory text explicitly contemplates that State and local \ngovernments participating in VPPP projects would use toll revenues to fund other “projects eligible \nunder such title,” VPPP, cl. 3, which includes capital transit projects.  The statute also provides that \nthe Secretary must periodically report on the effects that VPPP projects have on not only congestion \nbut also “transit ridership … and availability of funds for transportation programs.”  Id., cl. 5.  \nFurthermore, the legislative history of ISTEA and the subsequent laws amending the VPPP \nconfirms that Congress intended for State and local governments to consider revenue generation \nfor mass transit projects in implementing VPPP projects and to be able to use revenues to improve \ntransit services and systems. \n225.  Defendants’ rationales for purportedly terminating the VPPP Agreement are flatly \ncontradicted by the factual record, the text of the VPPP, the legislative history of ISTEA, and \nFHWA’s subsequent statements about and efforts to implement the VPPP and value pricing \nprojects.  Therefore, Defendants have acted contrary to law and the Duffy Letter is arbitrary and \ncapricious and must be declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside.  \n  97   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 98 of 111\n \nCOUNT III \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Procedurally Arbitrary & Capricious – Contrary to Regulations) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n226.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n227.  The VPPP Agreement is a cooperative agreement because “the principal purpose \nof the relationship is to transfer a thing of value” (authority to collect toll revenues) and “substantial \n[federal] involvement is expected.”  31 U.S.C. § 6305; 2 C.F.R. § 200.1; see also VPPP, cl. 1 \n(authorizing Secretary to enter into “cooperative agreements” under the VPPP).  FHWA has \ndetermined that agreements authorizing projects that require tolling authority under the VPPP are \ncooperative agreements, even where such agreements do not include a federal funding component.  \nSee FED. HIGHWAY ADMIN., Congestion Pricing, Value Pricing Pilot Program (May 17, 2024), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing (“The Moving Ahead for Progress in the \n21st Century (MAP-21) Act did not authorize additional funds after FY2012 for the discretionary \ngrant component of the Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP).  However, FHWA’s ability to enter \ninto cooperative agreements for projects that require tolling authority under this program for their \nimplementation will continue.”) (last accessed Feb. 12, 2025). \n228.  FHWA cooperative agreements are governed by the Office of Management and \nBudget’s  agency-wide  Uniform  Administrative  Requirements,  Cost  Principles,  and  Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards (“Uniform Guidance”), 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  See id. § 1201.1.  \nThe Uniform Guidance sets out specific conditions under which  a cooperative agreement, see id. \n§ 200.1, may be terminated:  \na.  by the agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms and conditions” \n  98   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 99 of 111\n \nof the award;  \nb.  by the agency with the “consent” of the recipient;  \nc.  by the recipient; and \nd.  by the agency “pursuant to the terms and conditions” of the award.   \nId. § 200.340(a).   \n \n229.  None of the conditions in which termination is permitted under the Uniform \nGuidance are present here.  First, Duffy did not and cannot claim that the recipients have failed to \ncomply with the terms of the conditions of the VPPP Agreement, and the recipients have in fact \ncomplied with the terms of the VPPP Agreement; second, the recipients did not and do not consent \nto termination of the VPPP Agreement; third, the recipients have not requested termination of the \nVPPP Agreement; and, fourth, the VPPP Agreement does not contain any provisions that would \npermit Defendants to terminate the agreement unilaterally.  Additionally, to the extent the VPPP \nAgreement contemplates termination by any party, it reflects that TBTA would be the one party \nwhich could “discontinue tolls on the Project.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 11. \n230.  The Uniform Guidance describes specific steps that an agency must take before it \nmay terminate an award for noncompliance, including providing written notice and an opportunity \nto be heard.  2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341(a), 342.178  FHWA did not provide the recipients with notice of \nits intent to terminate the VPPP Agreement and also has not provided notice to the recipients of any \nalleged noncompliance with the VPPP Agreement.  The recipients have not been provided with an \nopportunity to be heard or to appeal the termination. \n \n178  See  also  U.S.  DEP’T  OF  TRANSP.,  Guide  to  Financial  Assistance  at  72-77  (Oct.  2019), \nhttps://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-10/DOT_Guide_to_Financial_Assistance \n_effective_January_1_2020.pdf (further describing requirements for pre-termination notice and appeals).   \n  99   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 100 of 111\n \n231.  The  Administration’s  action  in  terminating  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement contrary to the terms of the VPPP Agreement and the applicable regulations governing \nthe administration of the VPPP Agreement was arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, \nand without observance of procedure required by law, within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by the Court. \nCOUNT IV \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Substantively Arbitrary & Capricious – Insufficient Explanation) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.)  \n \n232.

At the time of Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, FHWA \nhad issued the Final EA, FONSI, Reevaluation 1, and Reevaluation 2, and had executed the VPPP \nAgreement authorizing tolling under the Program.   \n234.  FHWA’s execution of the VPPP Agreement constituted final agency action with \nrespect to FHWA’s decision to authorize tolling under the Program. \n235.  Under the APA, an agency “changing its course” is “obligated to supply a reasoned \nanalysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first \ninstance.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n42 (1983).  \n236.  Defendants did not adequately explain their reasoning for purportedly rescinding \nthe VPPP Agreement, in violation of the APA.  See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, \n106 (2015) (“[T]he APA requires an agency to provide more substantial justification when ‘its new \npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its \n  100   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 101 of 111\n \nprior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’”) (quoting \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)). \n237.  Defendants did not adequately examine or rely on relevant data in deciding to \nterminate the VPPP Agreement, in violation of the APA.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at \n43 (an agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \naction.”).  The rationales given for rescinding the VPPP Agreement in the Duffy Letter, and for \nconcluding that the VPPP does not authorize the Program, are incorrect, invalid, and directly \ncontrary to the position of the FHWA for the past 34 years. \n238.  Defendants failed to consider the impact on the economy, the environment, and \ncongestion in the CBD in acting to terminate the tolling authority for the Program.  The Program \nwill provide substantial benefits to the CBD and the region in terms of reduced traffic and \ncongestion, improved air quality, and concomitant environmental, public health, and economic \nbenefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that occurred following the implementation of the \nProgram.   \n239.  Defendants were obligated to consider the costs of ending the VPPP Agreement for \nPlaintiffs and for transit riders, people residing, working, learning and recreating in and around the \nCBD.  Defendants failed to do so, having made their decision without seeking input from Plaintiffs \nand without inquiring about the costs from congestion, pollution, and cessation of the Program in \nwhich TBTA has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to bring online.   \n240.  Defendants also failed to adequately consider whether “there was ‘legitimate \nreliance’ on the” FHWA’s longstanding interpretation and use of the VPPP as an indispensable tool \nin efforts to address congestion, reduce pollution, and raise revenues to support public transit.  Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020) (quoting Smiley v. \n  101   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 102 of 111\n \nCitibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996)).  The MTA, TBTA, and now holders of \ndebt issued in reliance on Program revenues, have all relied on the executed VPPP Agreement.  The \nDuffy Letter was arbitrary and capricious; where, as here, “an agency changes course … it must \n‘be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must \nbe taken into account.”’  Id. (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 \n(2016)).   \n241.  Instead, Defendants acted entirely based on political considerations.  Defendants \nhad made no indication that they were reconsidering the Program until President Trump took office \nlast month.  But President Trump has long indicated his desire to “kill” or terminate the Program, \nboth in conversations with Republican lawmakers and in social media posts.  Defendants, bending \nunder this political pressure, did not undertake any analysis or provide any explanation before \nrevoking their prior decision to enter into the VPPP Agreement and approve the Program. \n242.  Defendants’  action  purporting  to  revoke  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement without providing sufficient explanation of their decision was therefore arbitrary, \ncapricious, and not in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, \nwithin the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by \nthe Court. \nCOUNT V \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Pretext) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 3) \n243.  “[I]n order to permit meaningful judicial review, an agency must ‘disclose the \nbasis’ of its action.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780 (2019) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 167-69 (1962)).  Here, “[s]everal points, \n  102   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 103 of 111\n \nconsidered together, reveal a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and \nthe rationale he provided.”  Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 783. \n244.  President Trump made his intention to “TERMINATE” the Program clear as a \ncandidate for office, see supra ¶ 155, and continued to reiterate his goal in statements after winning \nelection, see supra ¶¶ 156-59.  While the reasons for the President’s opposition to the Program \nhave changed over time, he never expressed concern that the Program was unauthorized by the \nVPPP. \n245.  The Duffy Letter states that Duffy, upon assuming office, was directed by President \nTrump to “review FHWA’s approval of the [Program]” in light of the President’s “concerns” about \n“the extent of the tolling” and “the significant burdens on the New York City residents, businesses, \nand area commuters (including those from New Jersey and Connecticut) who regularly use the \nhighway network in the CBD tolling area.”  Duffy Ltr. at 1.   \n246.  Very shortly after receiving this directive from President Trump, Duffy purported \nto announce a dramatic change in USDOT and FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of the VPPP \nin an informal opinion letter with little or no legal reasoning.  While Duffy claimed to rest his \ndecision  on  purely  legal  rationales,  the  vast  majority  of  his  letter  is  spent  reciting  policy \ndisagreements with the Program, see supra ¶ 163.  Likewise, Duffy’s public statements have made \nabundantly clear that his true motivation for purporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement is \npolitical disagreement with the Program itself. \n247.  Since then, Defendants have pressed forward with their openly political effort to \nend the Program by threatening to illegally withhold federal funding from the State of New York \n(and by implication, from Plaintiffs), and by raising clearly pretextual concerns about subway \nsafety, at a time when subway crime is at historic lows.  See supra ¶¶ 182-93.  These actions further \n  103   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 104 of 111\n \nreinforce that Defendants’ goal from the start has been to end the Program, rather than interpret \nthe text of the VPPP, and that Defendants worked backwards to attempt to conjure a legal rational \nwith which to “TERMINATE” the Program. \n248.  Duffy’s  reliance  on  questionable  legal  interpretations  to  justify  his  complete \ndisregard for Plaintiffs’ reliance interests—which would otherwise constrain the agency from \nabruptly terminating the VPPP Agreement and abandoning its long held interpretation of the \nVPPP—reinforces that Duffy’s reasoning is pretextual, and intended to shield his true decisional \nprocess from judicial review. \n249.  “Altogether, the evidence tells a story that does not match the explanation the \nSecretary gave for his decision.”  Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 784.  The Administrative Procedure \nAct  bars  such  pretextual  decision-making:  “The  reasoned  explanation  requirement  of \nadministrative law, after all, is meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for \nimportant decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.  Accepting \ncontrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.”  Id. at 785.  The Duffy Letter’s \npretextual rationales violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the APA and, in addition, violated the MTA, \nTBTA, and NYCDOT’s rights under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. \nCOUNT VI \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment  \n(U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 3) \n250.  Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT reallege and incorporate by reference all \npreceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein.   \n251.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “No person shall … \nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend. V, cl. 3. \n  104   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 105 of 111\n \n252.  Upon  the  execution  of  the  VPPP  Agreement,  Plaintiffs  MTA,  TBTA,  and \nNYCDOT had a property interest in the VPPP Agreement and in the authority granted by the VPPP \nAgreement to implement tolls within the CBD for the Program.  \n253.  An agency’s withdrawal of consent for public or private entities to engage in a \ncontract implicates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Toxco Inc. \nv. Chu, 724 F. Supp. 2d 16, 27-28 (D.D.C. 2010).  Defendants’ unilateral termination of the VPPP \nAgreement deprives Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT of a property interest contrary to law. \n254.  Further, Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT’s property interest in the Program \nand its infrastructure “attain … constitutional status by virtue of the fact that they have been initially \nrecognized and protected by state law,” here, the TMA, and further recognized in the VPPP \nAgreement.  Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign Inv., 758 F.3d 296, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting \nPaul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710 (1976)).  \n255.  Unilateral termination of the VPPP Agreement does not afford Plaintiffs MTA, \nTBTA, and NYCDOT the process they are entitled to under the VPPP Agreement, the relevant \nregulations, and the United States Constitution.  Prior to terminating the VPPP Agreement, \nDefendants did not provide Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT with notice and failed to give \nPlaintiffs an opportunity to respond or be heard. \n256.  In  addition,  the  VPPP  Agreement  constitutes  an  agreement  which  cannot  be \ninvalidated without due process in accordance with its terms.   \n257.  Defendants’ actions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by \ndepriving Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT without due process of their property interest in \nthe VPPP Agreement and the authority granted by the VPPP Agreement to implement tolls within \nthe CBD for the Program. \n  105   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 106 of 111\n \nCOUNT VII \nUltra Vires \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \n258.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.  \n259.  The acts of all executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, and in case \nan official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have jurisdiction to \ngrant relief.”  McAnnulty, 187 U.S. at 108.  \n260.  ISTEA  does  not  authorize  Defendants  to  unilaterally  rescind  a  cooperative \nagreement entered into to authorize tolling under the VPPP, nor does the VPPP Agreement itself \nempower Defendants to terminate the agreement or rescind FHWA’s approval of the Program.  \n261.  The Duffy Letter is ultra vires because it purports to unilaterally terminate the \nVPPP Agreement and rescind TBTA’s authority to implement tolls under the VPPP for the Program \nwithout statutory authority and contrary to the applicable agency regulations and the terms of the \nVPPP Agreement.  \n262.  The Duffy Letter is ultra vires because rescission of the VPPP Agreement is not \nauthorized under any provision of law.  \n263.  The Duffy Letter is ultra vires because the VPPP Agreement is a valid and binding \nagreement and the VPPP Agreement does not permit unilateral rescission by FHWA or any other \ngovernmental actor. \n264.  In addition, an executive officer also acts ultra vires where it “deprives a contractor \nof a right expressly or impliedly granted by another statute.”  Reich, 74 F.3d at 1328.  \n265.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of rights expressly and impliedly granted by \nISTEA §1012(b), and thus acted ultra vires.  \n  106   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 107 of 111\n \nCOUNT VIII \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act \n(42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.; 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706) \n266.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n267.  At  the  time  of  Defendants’  purported  termination  of  the  VPPP  Agreement, \nDefendants had issued the Final EA, FONSI, Reevaluation 1, and Reevaluation 2, and had executed \nthe VPPP Agreement authorizing tolling under the Program.   \n268.  At the time of Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, the \nNEPA process for the Program was complete, and there was no “major federal action” remaining \nto occur with respect to the Program.   \n269.  Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement constitutes a new final \nagency action under NEPA and the APA and a major federal action within the meaning of NEPA, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 4332(C), 4336e(10). \n270.  NEPA requires Defendants to prepare an EIS for any “major Federal action[] \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).   \n271.  To determine whether a “major federal action” will have a significant effect on “the \nquality of the human environment,” Defendants may prepare an EA.  42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 \nC.F.R. § 771.119.   \n272.  If an agency determines that the proposed action will not have significant effects, \naccounting for mitigation, it can issue a FONSI. 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.121.  If \nthe EA reveals that there may be significant effects, an EIS is required.   \n  107   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 108 of 111\n \n273.  Either level of review requires public participation opportunities and consideration \nof  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action.    E.g.,  42  U.S.C.  §  4332(C)(iii),  (F),  (H);  23  C.F.R. \n§ 771.119(b).  \n274.  Defendants failed to undertake any NEPA review of their decision to terminate the \nVPPP Agreement, much less an adequate environmental review that considered  environmental \nimpacts of the proposed action.   \n275.  Defendants did not undertake any public participation with respect to their decision \nto terminate the VPPP Agreement, in contrast to the substantial public participation opportunities \nafforded prior to the adoption of the Final EA (including a 44-day public comment period) and \nFONSI (including a 30-day public availability period).   \n276.  Under NEPA and its implementing regulations, Defendants are required to take a \nhard look at the reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental impacts of a proposed \naction and its alternatives.  42 U.S.C. § 4336; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b).   \n277.  Defendants failed to consider the full extent of the reasonably foreseeable impacts \nof seeking to terminate the Program, which will provide substantial benefits to the CBD and the \nregion  in  terms  of  reduced  traffic  and  congestion,  improved  air  quality,  and  concomitant \nenvironmental, public health, and economic benefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that \noccurred following the implementation of the Program.   \n278.  Defendants failed to consider alternatives to terminating the program. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4332(C)(iii), (F), (H); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b). \n279.  Defendants failed to consider or identify measures which might mitigate adverse \nenvironmental impacts, and incorporate measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts into its \naction terminating the VPPP Agreement.  23 C.F.R. §§ 771.105(e), 771.119(b).   \n  108   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 109 of 111\n \n280.  Defendants’  action  in  purportedly  revoking  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement without conducting the required NEPA review was therefore arbitrary, capricious, not \nin accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, within the meaning \nof the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by the Court. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:  \ni.  Declare that Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement \nand rescission of tolling authority under the VPPP was undertaken in \nviolation of the terms of the VPPP Agreement and in excess of statutory \nauthority;  arbitrary  and  capricious  in  violation  of  the  APA;  without \nobservance of procedure required by law and regulation in violation of the \nAPA; based on a pretextual rational in violation of the APA; in violation of \nPlaintiffs the MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT’s Fifth Amendment right to Due \nProcess; ultra vires; and in violation of NEPA; \nii.  Declare the Duffy Letter, the February 20 Shepherd Letter, and the March \n20 Shepherd Letter null, void, and of no effect, and vacate each letter; \niii.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, postpone the effective date of the March 20 \nShepherd Letter so as to preserve the status quo and the rights of Plaintiffs; \niv.  Grant any further necessary and proper relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202; \nv.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  enforcing  the  Duffy  Letter,  the  February  20 \nShepherd Letter, and the March 20 Shepherd Letter, or from withdrawing, \ncancelling,  delaying,  rescinding,  or  withholding  any  appropriated, \nauthorized, obligated, committed, and/or otherwise due federal funding \nfrom Plaintiffs in retaliation for commencing this action or for continuing \nto operate the Program; \nvi.  Enjoin Defendants from withdrawing, cancelling, delaying, rescinding, or \nwithholding any appropriated, authorized, obligated, committed, and/or \notherwise  due  federal  funding  from  Plaintiffs  in  the  absence  of \nconstitutional and statutory authority and in compliance with applicable law \nand procedure; \nvii.  Award Plaintiffs their costs for the action, including reasonable attorneys’ \nfees; and  \nviii.  Grant all such other and further relief as it deems just and proper. \n \n  109   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 62     Filed 04/18/25     Page 110 of 111\n \n \nDated: April 18, 2025    Respectfully submitted, \nNew York, New York \n \n   /s/ Roberta A.

On January 5, 2025, the State of New York embarked on a bold new program to\nreduce traffic congestion in the New York City metropolitan area and fund and promote public \ntransit with the Central Business District (“CBD”) Tolling Program (“Program”).  The Program, \nalso known as Congestion Pricing, is a market-based, user-pay solution that has seen success in \nmajor cities around the world and was first conceived of right here in New York City as a possible \nsolution to Manhattan’s longstanding congestion woes.   \n2. New York Decides to Implement the Program.  For many years, the CBD was one\nof the most congested urban areas in the country.  Travel times were extraordinarily slow.  Indeed, \nthe term “gridlock” was invented in Manhattan.  Congestion in the CBD has been a $20 billion \nannual drag on the regional economy, and thus the national economy as well.   \n3. In the 1950s, Nobel laureate and Columbia University economist William S.\nVickrey proposed a market-based solution to the congestion affecting the City: charging vehicles \nto drive in highly congested areas.  Over the following decades, New York state and local officials, \npolicy experts, and advocacy groups studied various solutions to identify the most effective way \nto reduce congestion, which results in lost productivity, poor air quality, slower and less reliable \npublic bus service, delayed emergency response times, and reduced public safety, among other \nharmful conditions.  That extensive deliberation led to the consensus that congestion pricing is the \nmost effective tool to achieve that goal—a consensus supported by the experience of London, \nSingapore, Stockholm, and Milan, which have each implemented their own congestion pricing \nprograms and have seen as a result significant decreases in vehicle congestion and corresponding \nincreases in the use of public transit facilities like subways and buses. \n4. In April 2019, following multiple attempts by New York elected officials to\nimplement a form of congestion pricing, the New York Legislature and then-Governor Andrew \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 3 of 119\n \nCuomo passed the Traffic Mobility Act (“TMA”), a landmark statute with the goal of reducing \ntraffic congestion in the CBD and creating a dedicated funding source for the MTA’s capital needs.  \nN.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 1701 et seq.  The TMA authorized and directed TBTA, the MTA’s \nindependent affiliate, to establish and operate a congestion pricing program, including tolling of \neligible vehicles entering or remaining in the CBD, and earmarked the revenues from the Program \nfor the MTA’s 2020-2024 Capital Program (the “Capital Program”) and subsequent capital \nprograms. \n5.  Shortly after the TMA was enacted, in the spring of 2019, New York State, through \nNYSDOT, TBTA, and NYCDOT (collectively, the “Project Sponsors”), attended several meetings \nwith representatives from the first Trump Administration’s FHWA and USDOT to discuss and \npresent the proposed program.  During those meetings, the Project Sponsors explained that the \nProgram would accomplish its aims by tolling eligible vehicles entering the CBD in order to \nincentivize the use of modes other than driving, and using those tolling revenues to improve the \nmetropolitan region’s public transportation infrastructure, thereby further encouraging the use of \npublic transit.   \n6.  The Federal Defendants Authorize the Program Under the Value Pricing Pilot \nProgram.  Early on, FHWA and USDOT took the position that the “best fit” for the Program would \nbe for the Project Sponsors to apply for federal tolling authorization through the Value Pricing \nPilot Program, a statutory provision under which FHWA may authorize congestion pricing on \nfederal-aid highways to reduce roadway congestion and improve air quality.  See 23 U.S.C. § 149 \nnote (Value Pricing Pilot Program) (“VPPP”).1  The VPPP, originally called the Congestion \n \n1 A “federal-aid highway” is a “public highway eligible for assistance” under provisions of Chapter 1, Title 23 of the \nUnited States Code, “other than a highway functionally classified as a local road or rural minor collector.”  23 U.S.C. \n§ 101(a)(6). \n  3   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 4 of 119\n \nPricing Pilot Program, has been used across the country to authorize tolling to reduce congestion, \nimprove the environment, and raise funding for public transit.  It has specifically been used in Fort \nMyers, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to finance and study congestion pricing in urban areas \nthrough the establishment of tolls to enter an area, similar to the programs that exist in London, \nSingapore, Stockholm, and Milan.  Indeed, this type of tolling, known as “cordon pricing” (or \nsometimes “zone-based pricing” or “area-wide pricing”), has consistently been recognized, in \nCongress and by USDOT and FHWA, as the model form of “congestion pricing” authorized under \nthe VPPP because it most effectively reduces overall congestion within a geographic area.   \n7.  In June 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted an Expression of Interest (“EoI”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit A, to FHWA for authority to assess tolls on vehicles entering the CBD.  \nThe EoI reiterated that the “purpose of [the Program] is to reduce the high level of traffic \ncongestion in the CBD,” and anticipated that “a variable toll to access the CBD, combined with an \ninvestment of the resultant revenues in improving public transit alternatives, will maximize the \ncongestion reduction in the CBD and the surrounding area.”  EoI at 1-2. \n8.  Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 \net seq., FHWA proceeded to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Program.  This \nincluded, as directed by a former Executive Order that has since been revoked by President Trump, \nthe Program’s potential to have a disproportionately high and adverse impact on minority and low-\nincome (i.e., environmental justice [“EJ”]) populations including EJ communities that have pre-\nexisting pollution and health burdens due to historic transportation and land use decisions.  After \na multi-year environmental review process from 2019 through 2024 that yielded an administrative \nrecord of more than 45,000 pages, FHWA and the Project Sponsors prepared a 958-page Final \nEnvironmental  Assessment  (“Final  EA”)  followed  by  a  Finding  of  No  Significant  Impact \n  4   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 5 of 119\n \n(“FONSI”)  and  two  Reevaluations,  which  determined  that  the  Program  would  not  have  a \nsignificant adverse impact on the environment or a disproportionately high and adverse impact on \nEJ communities in light of, among other things, (1) the anticipated reduction of overall vehicle \nmiles traveled (“VMT”) and vehicular emissions in the region, and (2) the Project Sponsors’ \ncommitment to a robust, $155 million mitigation package to improve air quality and public health \nin EJ communities that have pre-existing pollution and health burdens and could experience traffic \ndiversions as a result of the Program.   \n9.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA executed an agreement with the Project Sponsors \n(the “VPPP Agreement” or “VPPP Agmt.”), attached hereto as Exhibit B, pursuant to which \nFHWA approved the Program’s collection of tolls under the VPPP and required (among other \nthings) implementation of the Project Sponsors’ mitigation commitments.  Consistent with the \nVPPP, the VPPP Agreement recognizes that toll revenues may be used on any project eligible for \nfederal assistance, which includes public transit.  The VPPP Agreement also requires the Project \nSponsors to provide data on project performance (i.e., reduction of congestion and increased use \nof public transit) for “at least ten years.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 8(b). \n10.  The VPPP Agreement does not provide any right to the federal government to \nterminate the Program; rather, the VPPP Agreement provides only that the parties agree to “return \nthe Project to its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  \nId., cl. 11 (emphasis added). \n11.  The Program Is Succeeding.  The Program went into effect on January 5, 2025, and \nvehicles entering the CBD are being tolled in accordance with the toll rate schedule regulation \nadopted by the TBTA Board and authorized in the VPPP Agreement.  Already, the data collected \nto date (and simply looking at the roads) show that there is less congestion and the Program is \n  5   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 6 of 119\n \nworking: vehicle entries to the CBD and commute times have fallen; vehicle speeds—including \nthose of public buses—have increased; more people are visiting Manhattan’s commercial districts \nand supporting the region’s businesses; and the MTA’s mass transit system is seeing the benefit \nof increased ridership and increased funding.   \n12.  A recent study by researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research \n(“NBER”),  Google  Research,  Yale  University,  and  Stanford  University  found  that  the \n“introduction of congestion pricing led to an immediate increase in speeds within NYC’s CBD, \nwhich has persisted since implementation,” and estimated “that speeds in NYC’s CBD increased \nby 15%” on average and that the “effects on speeds are even larger during the afternoon—\nhistorically the most congested time of day—and persist even after peak-hours pricing ends at \n9pm.”2  Traffic in the CBD has decreased substantially, with approximately 5.8 million fewer \nvehicles entering the district in January through March 2025 than would be expected based on data \nfor prior years, representing a 12.5% reduction overall across the first three months of the \nProgram.3  The data also indicates a 10% reduction in VMT by all vehicles in the CBD from \nJanuary to mid-March of 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024.  \n13.  According to data collected by TRANSCOM, a coalition of 16 transportation and \npublic safety agencies in the broader metropolitan region, crossing times were 17% faster at the \nLincoln Tunnel and 48% faster at the Holland Tunnel in January 2025, compared to January 2024; \ntrip times from Brooklyn and Queens to the CBD have dropped between 10% and 30%; and \nexpress buses save about 10 minutes on their commutes.  Traffic speeds on river crossings have \n \n2 Cody Cook, et al., The Short-Run Effects of Congestion Pricing in New York City, NBER (March 17, 2025), \nhttps://shoshanavasserman.com/files/2025/03/NYC_Congestion_Pricing_2025.pdf (last accessed April 14, 2025). \n3 MTA, MTA Metrics: Vehicle Reductions, https://metrics.mta.info/?cbdtp/vehiclereductions (last accessed April 14, \n2025).   \n  6   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 7 of 119\n \nbeen 5% to 30% faster this February than last February.  Traffic speeds on major bridges improved \nsignificantly: on the Queensboro Bridge, by 31%; on the Brooklyn Bridge, by 26%; and on the \nManhattan Bridge, by 7%.4  These trends continued in March: fewer vehicles utilized the nine \nMTA bridges and tunnels, with levels dropping 2.4% from March of 2024 to March of 2025.5  The \nlargest reductions are at the Hugh L. Carey and Queens-Midtown Tunnels, which lead directly into \nthe CBD.  Truck traffic traveling through these tunnels dropped 14% this year compared to the \nsame period in 2024.6   \n14.  Honking is also down, as New Yorkers in the CBD are finally enjoying what might \nbe called some “peace and quiet” since the Program went into effect, corresponding to a 69% \ndecline in noise complaints about honking made to the City’s 311 portal.7   \n15.  The dire projections that the Program would harm business are also belied by the \ndata.  Credit card sales data reflect that retail sales in the CBD are on track to be $900 million \nhigher in 2025 compared to the same period last year.8  Crain’s New York Business reports that \nmore people visited the Business Improvement Districts (“BIDs”) within the CBD in January 2025 \nthan during the same month last year, noting a 4.6% year-over-year increase in visitation.9  Indeed, \n \n4 MTA, January 2025 MTA Board Meeting, Congestion Relief Zone Tolling January 29, 2025 Update 9, \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/163411 (last accessed Apr. 17, 2025); February 2025 MTA Board Presentation at \n10 (Feb. 26, 2025), https://www.mta.info/document/165401 (last accessed Apr. 17, 2025). \n5 MTA Daily Ridership and Traffic: Beginning 2020, Data.NY.Gov (Apr. 16, 2025), \nhttps://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-and-Traffic-Beginning-2020/sayj-mze2/about_data.  \n6 Samuel Schwartz, Where Have all the Trucks Gone?

Business leaders have voiced their support for the Program, recognizing the \nbenefits of Congestion Pricing for businesses in the CBD and the broader economy.  Greater New \nYork Chamber of Commerce CEO Mark Jaffe has stated that the Program “will improve the \nquality of life in Manhattan for all who live, work and visit,” and that decreased traffic from the \nProgram “should decrease labor time and improve the efficiencies of getting essential commodities \nonto the shelves.”12  The Partnership for New York City, a non-profit group of New York business \nleaders, has likewise voiced its support for the Program, pointing out that it could save “an \nestimated $20 billion that excess congestion costs annually because of more efficient and timely \nmovement of people and goods, which will increase productivity and reduce expenditures on fuel \nand overtime.”13  More recently, the Partnership for New York City’s President & CEO Kathryn \nWylde stated that, “[i]n every respect, this is a policy that President Trump and the Republicans \nshould be supporting.”14 \n \n10 Arun Venugopal, Vehicle Traffic is Down in Manhattan, But Pedestrian Traffic Is Up, Data Says, GOTHAMIST (Feb. \n13, 2025), https://gothamist.com/news/vehicle-traffic-is-down-in-manhattan-but-pedestrian-traffic-is-up-data-says. \n11  Research  &  Statistics,  Grosses-Broadway  in  NYC,  THE  BROADWAY  LEAGUE \nhttps://www.broadwayleague.com/research/grosses-broadway-nyc/ (last accessed Apr. 17, 2025).Gersh Kuntzman, \nWind in Their Sales: Congestion Pricing Is No ‘Toll’ on the Broadway Box Office, STREETSBLOG NYC (Feb. 5, 2025), \nhttps://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/05/wind-in-their-sales-congestion-pricing-is-no-toll-on-the-broadway-box-office. \n12 New York’s Chamber (@NYChamber), X (Nov. 15, 2024, 3:29 PM), \nhttps://x.com/NYChamber/status/1857521387583451602.  \n13 Louisa Chafee, et al., Op-ed: Congestion Pricing Will Be a Boon for New York, PFNYC.ORG (Nov. 14, 2014), \nhttps://pfnyc.org/news/op-ed-congestion-pricing-will-be-a-boon-for-new-york/.  \n14 Ry Rivard & Nick Reisman, New York’s Business Boosters Push Trump to Keep Manhattan Tolls, POLITICO (Feb. \n11, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/new-york-trump-congestion-pricing-00203540.  \n  8   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 9 of 119\n \n17.  The  region’s  subways,  buses,  and  commuter  railroads—vital  transportation \nlifelines for so many New Yorkers who live in the metropolitan area and beyond—are already \nbenefiting from substantial investments that have been made as a result of the Program.  In \nparticular, key tenets of the Capital Program include improving outdated signaling and other \nequipment  to  increase  system  reliability;  improving  safety  and  customer  service  through \ntechnology; and extending public transit to underserved areas.  And the Program will create many \nmore benefits going forward.  For example, Program revenue will be used to update and renovate \nnumerous subway stations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act by building new \nelevators at 70 stations across the boroughs and replacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators, \nbringing the transportation system to greater than 50% accessibility.   \n18.  In addition, Program revenue will be used to advance the $155 million package of \nmitigation for EJ communities, which is designed to address preexisting pollution and chronic \nhealth burdens.  These measures will include replacing diesel engines with cleaner technology; \ninstalling electric charging infrastructure for trucks; planting roadside vegetation to improve near-\nroad air quality; and installing air filtration units in schools near highways.   \n19.  TBTA has also issued debt that is supported by revenues generated by the Program \nand by long-term bonds issued partly in reliance on revenues generated by the Program.  This \nincludes no less than $378.8 million in short-term notes currently outstanding to fund infrastructure \ncosts, and $500 million in short-term notes to fund a portion of the $15 billion of capital projects \nin the Capital Program.  By the end of the month, TBTA also expects to close a $500 million bank \nloan to support the Capital Program, relying on Program revenues as security. \n  9   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 10 of 119\n \n20.  New Yorkers support the Program because it is working.  According to a poll \nreported by CBS News, the majority of New Yorkers want the Program to continue.15  On a 2-to-\n1 basis, New Yorkers say that the Program is working.16  The Program’s biggest supporters are \nthe individuals who actually drive into the CBD frequently.17  Ultimately, 6 out of every 10 New \nYorkers say that President Trump should not take any steps to end the Program.18 \n21.  The New Administration Seeks to “Terminate” the Program.  Notwithstanding the \nextensive evaluations—and now results—showing that Congestion Pricing is the best way to \nreduce congestion in the CBD, reduce overall vehicle emissions in the greater region, and improve \nthe accessibility and reliability of public transit, the Program has continued to have its political \ndetractors, including the President of the United States.  As early as May 2024, President Trump \nposted on “Truth Social” that he would “TERMINATE Congestion Pricing in my FIRST WEEK \nback in Office,” and subsequent media reports—from the President and his allies in Congress—\nindicated that the Administration wished to immediately and summarily end Congestion Pricing \nto achieve political objectives.   \n \n15Alecia Reid, 6 in 10 Say They Want NYC Congestion Pricing to Continue, New Poll Finds, CBS NEWS (Feb. 5, \n2025), https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/newyork/news/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-morning-consult-poll/.   \n16 Id.  \n17 Id. \n18 Id. \n  10   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 11 of 119\n \n22.  On  February  19,  2025,  the  Trump  Administration  attempted  to  do  just  that.  \nDefendant USDOT Secretary Duffy issued a letter to Governor Hochul, attached hereto as \nExhibit C (the “February 19 Letter” or “Feb.  19 Ltr.”), purporting to “rescind” the VPPP \nAgreement  and  “terminate”  the  Program.    The  White  House  “X”  account  proclaimed  that \n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD.  Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED.  LONG LIVE \nTHE KING!”, along with a picture of President Trump wearing a crown in front of the Manhattan \nskyline. \n \nFigure 1: Feb. 19, 2025 social media post to X.com by @WhiteHouse \n23.  Despite the Administration’s “royal” decree, its effort to summarily and unilaterally \noverturn the solution to the City’s congestion enacted by New Yorkers’ elected representatives is \nunlawful and invalid.  Accordingly, Congestion Pricing remains alive and well, and the MTA and \nTBTA responded by filing this lawsuit seeking a declaration that the Administration’s actions are \n  11   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 12 of 119\n \nnull and void and for vacatur of the purported “rescission” and “termination.”  NYSDOT and \nNYCDOT then successfully moved to intervene as plaintiffs in this lawsuit and, together with the \nMTA and TBTA, submitted a consolidated first amended consolidated complaint on April 18, \n2025.  ECF 62.  Riders Alliance and Sierra Club also successfully moved to intervene as plaintiffs \nin this lawsuit and filed their own complaint on March 8, 2025, ECF 41, which they amended on \nApril 18, 2025, ECF 63. \n24.  Neither the VPPP Agreement nor applicable law or regulations permit Defendants \nto unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement.  This makes good sense.  If Defendants had some \nabsolute right to unilaterally terminate a VPPP program that had already been approved and \nimplemented, it would create uncertainty around the future of such programs any time leadership \nat FHWA, USDOT, or the White House changed—uncertainty that would obviously undermine \nthe purposes of the VPPP, make it difficult to issue bonds for other projects, and be inimical to a \nrules-based, market economy.   \n25.  Beyond  that,  the  two  legal  rationales  for  attempting  to  terminate  the  VPPP \nAgreement in Duffy’s February 19 letter are so weak as to be transparently pretextual.  First, Duffy \nclaimed that the VPPP does not authorize cordon pricing.  But the reality is that the VPPP’s broad \nlanguage authorizes a variety of congestion pricing strategies, including cordon pricing, and \nDuffy’s tortured reading is contrary to: (i) the ordinary meaning of “congestion pricing” at the time \nthat the VPPP was enacted (and each time it has subsequently been reauthorized), (ii) the statute’s \nlegislative history, and (iii) more recent pronouncements from Congress.  It is also contradicted by \nFHWA’s own official guidance documents and reports and FHWA’s approval of other cordon-\nbased pilot projects.   \n26.  Duffy’s second reason seems to relate to his factually incorrect claim that the toll \n  12   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 13 of 119\n \nrate schedule regulation associated with the Program is “driven primarily by the need to raise \nrevenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) system.”  Even if that were the case, \nwhich it is not, it is perfectly clear from the statutory text, the legislative history, and the agency’s \nguidance and actions that States may, and are actually expected to, consider revenue objectives \nwhen setting toll rates for projects authorized under the VPPP.  Indeed, Congress expressly stated \nthat States would use toll revenues to fund other “projects eligible under such title,” VPPP, cl. 3—\nwhich include transit capital projects—and directed the Secretary to report on the effects that VPPP \nprojects have on not only congestion but also “transit ridership … and availability of funds for \ntransportation  programs,”  id.  at  cl.  5.    In  a  different  section  of  the  Intermodal  Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-240 (Dec. 18, 1991) (“ISTEA”), the statute \nthat  created  the  VPPP,  Congress  even  required  States  to  consider  “the  use  of  innovative \nmechanisms for financing [transportation] projects, including ... congestion pricing,” ISTEA \n§ 1025(a).  For these reasons, Duffy’s view that congestion pricing was not authorized by the \nVPPP borders on being specious. \n27.  In the decades since the VPPP was enacted, Congress and FHWA have both \nrepeatedly concluded that the VPPP authorizes cordon-based congestion pricing in New York City \nand that the revenues from such a program may be used to fund transit infrastructure.  Duffy’s \nabrupt and politically motivated departure from this consensus provides no legitimate basis for \nFHWA’s reversal of its position on the Program, particularly after FHWA reaffirmed the FONSI \nand approved the Program only a few months prior.  And, in stark contrast to the five-year process \nthat led to FHWA’s VPPP approval, Defendants formed this newfound position, and took this \nagency action, a month following the change in administration, despite having provided no \nmeaningful legal analysis as to their ability to terminate or justifications for terminating the \n  13   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 14 of 119\n \nProgram, and despite having conducted no NEPA review of the effects on the environment from \nceasing tolling and reintroducing tens of thousands of additional vehicular trips into the CBD daily, \npreventing improvements to the region’s public transit infrastructure, or terminating the EJ \nmitigation committed to as part of the Program and to be funded through Program revenue.   \n28.  Further  demonstrating  the  pretextual  and  arbitrary  nature  of  the  termination, \nDuffy’s rationale is in direct conflict with his stated policy to “prioritize” projects “that utilize \nuser-pay models,” like Congestion Pricing.  It also runs afoul of Duffy’s own recent remarks that \nsaving people time on their commutes would be part of his mission as Secretary.  As Duffy stated \nduring a conference of state highway and transportation officials on February 5, 2025, the \nAdministration should be committed to creating projects that:  \nMak[e] people’s lives better.  What you do makes people’s lives \nbetter.  We’re able to get to work and back home to see our loved \nones more quickly.  If we don’t have our systems that are delayed \nand we don’t sit in traffic we get to spend an extra 15 minutes, \nmaybe an extra 45 minutes a day with the ones that we love as \nopposed to listening to music or a podcast or, I don’t know what you \nlisten to in the car, but whatever you’re listening to in the car, or on \nthe train.  We can make people’s lives better and spend time with \nthe  people  we  love  as  opposed  to  going  to  the  grind  of  our \ntransportation system.19   \nOf course, the threatened cancellation of Congestion Pricing after it’s already been operating \nsuccessfully for more than three months actually would be the opposite of “making people’s lives \nbetter” in this important way.  \n29.  In addition to being inconsistent with the Administration’s own broader policy \nstatements, the purported termination of the Program runs contrary to its purported respect for \n \n19 Sean Duffy, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy Speaks at the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation  Officials  2025  Washington  Briefing,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Transp.

The Program is the first congestion pricing program of its kind to be implemented in \nthe United States, a necessary solution to the unique policy challenges facing the New York \nmetropolitan region and one that reflects the will of the majority of New Yorkers and their elected \nrepresentatives at every level of government.  Indeed, the clear consensus of the experts and policy \nmakers that have studied the issue is that cordon pricing is the most effective method to reduce \ncongestion in Manhattan—a narrow island with a dense network of roads and numerous points of \ningress and egress.  It is also a program that could provide a pathway for other congested urban \nareas to reduce congestion and fund public transit.  As Justice Brandeis explained nearly a century \nago, “[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if \nits citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without \nrisk to the rest of the country.”  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 597 n.20 (1977) (quoting New State \nIce Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J. dissenting)).  President Trump claims \nto embrace this philosophy and has even pledged, in his own signature way, to “make states the \nlaboratories of democracy once again.”20  In his first inaugural address, President Trump declared \nthat “we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party \nto another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the \nAmerican people.”21  And Duffy, shortly after being confirmed as Secretary of Transportation, \ncommitted to not interfere with state transportation initiatives, promising state highway and \ntransportation officials: “I think that you guys know how to do your jobs, and I think we should \nrethink the way we’re doing business together by giving you all a lot more autonomy and a lot \nmore authority, a lot more freedom to do the projects that you know are important in your \n \n20 Michael Stratford, Trump Endorses States’ Rights – But Only When He Agrees with the State, POLITICO (Apr. 2, \n2018), https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/02/trump-states-rights-education-sanctuary-drilling-492784.   \n21 Id.  \n  15   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 16 of 119\n \ncommunities.”22  Yet the Administration’s efforts to end the Program, when most New Yorkers \nbelieve it should not interfere, are directly contrary to those commitments.  \n30.  The Administration Seeks to Coerce Compliance and Threatens to Retaliate.  With \nno viable defense to Plaintiffs’ claims on the merits, the Administration has resorted to what has \nbecome its modus operandi: attempting to improperly leverage federal funding as a way to compel \ncompliance with its unlawful decrees.23  On March 18, 2025, Duffy sent a letter to the MTA, \nattached hereto as Exhibit D, demanding information on crime and safety in subways and on buses \nin New York City and threatening “further consequences, up to and including redirecting or \nwithholding funding.”  Although the letter did not directly reference Congestion Pricing, it was \nwidely perceived as an attempt to gain leverage in his efforts to discontinue the Program and “la[y] \nthe groundwork for citing crime as a reason to ultimately withhold federal money,” coming just \nthree days before Defendants’ then-March 21, 2025 purported deadline for the Program to cease \ntolling.24   \n31.  On March 20, 2025, Duffy’s message was even clearer.  He posted on X an apparent \nthreat that Defendants might withhold unspecified federal funding from the State of New York \n(and, by implication, from the MTA, TBTA, and NYSDOT), unless the Program is ended.     \n \n22 Sean Duffy, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy Speaks at the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials 2025 Washington Briefing (Feb. 5, 2025), https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-\nsecretary-transportation-sean-duffy-speaks-american-association-state-highway-and. \n23 Alex Lemonides et al., Tracking the Lawsuits Against Trump’s Agenda, N.Y.

On March 25, 2025, in response to a letter from Governor Hochul, State Senate \nMajority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie proposing an \nupdate to the federal transit funding formula, which awards the MTA only 17% of transit funding, \ndespite its carrying 43% of the nation’s mass transit riders, Duffy again took to X to suggest that \nDefendants  may  improperly  withhold  federal  funds.    Duffy  described  the  proposal  as \n“Outrageous!” and accused the State of “trying to fill the gap with highway funds and taxing the \nworking class”—invoking a term opponents to Congestion Pricing have used to disparage the \ntolls—rather than “actually fixing their financial mismanagement.”  Using the same language from \nhis earlier X post demanding that New York end the Program, Duffy once again warned that “[t]he \nfederal government is not a blank check.” \n  17   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 18 of 119\n \n \nFigure 3: Mar. 25, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n33.  On March 30, 2025 the MTA responded to Duffy’s request for information with a \nthorough, 22-page explanation as to why, in fact, New York’s subways are among the safest in the \nnation and crime is at a historic low.  Even so, the MTA said it would welcome further federal \ncollaboration to ensure that public transit continues as the best and most popular option for the \nregion’s commuters.   \n34.  Meanwhile, on March 20, 2025, Defendant Shepherd sent a letter to NYSDOT, \nNYCDOT, and MTA Bridges and Tunnels (the “March 20 Shepherd Letter” or “Mar. 20 Ltr.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit E, in which Shepherd noted her prior correspondence “providing you \nuntil March 21, 2025, to cease tolling operations that were initiated through the November 21, \n2024, Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP) Agreement,” stated that Duffy “has directed that I \nextend the period of time to comply by 30 days,” and instructed that “toll operations must cease \nby April 20, 2025.”  Mar. 20 Ltr. \n35.  In light of this background, on April 2, 2025, the MTA and TBTA asked counsel \n  18   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 19 of 119\n \nfor the Federal Defendants during a meet-and-confer for the initial conference in this matter if their \nclients intend to take unilateral action to enforce the April 20 “deadline.”  Counsel for the Federal \nDefendants “did not have information to provide” regarding the timing or likelihood of any such \nactions by their clients.  On April 8, however, DOT posted on its “USDOT Rapid Response” \naccount on X that it “will not hesitate to use every tool at our disposal in response to non-\ncompliance later this month.”25   \nFigure 4: Apr. 8, 2025 social media post to X by @USDOTRapid \n36.  On April 9, the Federal Defendants informed the Court during the initial conference \n \n25 @USDOTRapid, X.com (Apr. 8, 2025). \n  19   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 20 of 119\n \nthat Duffy is considering his options and had not yet made a final decision with respect to \nenforcement of the April 20 deadline.  The Federal Defendants, however, reiterated their position \nthat Plaintiffs should cease tolling by April 20. \n37.  On April 21, Duffy sent another letter to Governor Hochul demanding for a third \ntime that the Program end.  (“April 21 Letter”).  The April 21 Letter reaffirmed Defendants’ \nposition that the VPPP Agreement had been “terminated” by the February 19 Letter and threatened \nthat Defendants “will implement appropriate initial compliance measures” on or after May 28, \n2025 if New York continues to operate the Program.   \n38.  The  threatened  “compliance  measures”  include:  (1)  “no  further  advance \nconstruction (‘AC’) authorizations,”  (2) “no further [NEPA] approvals,” (3) “no further approvals \nof Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (‘STIP’) amendments concerning New York \nMetropolitan Transportation Council TIP modifications,” and (4) “no further obligations of \nFHWA funds (both formula and competitive) for projects within New York City.”  These \nincredibly broad coercive threats would among other things, if implemented, halt reviews needed \nfor all projects and funding within FHWA’s purview, including billions of dollars’ worth of \nfunding for transit projects currently proposed for addition to New York’s STIP, unless the \nProgram is brought to a stop. \n39.  The President is not a king, and Defendants have no right to demand compliance \nwith the Administration’s unlawful directives.  Plaintiffs will continue to operate the Program as \nrequired by New York law unless and until Plaintiffs are directed to stop by a court order.  \n40.  The MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT file this consolidated second amended \ncomplaint to seek a declaration that the Administration’s purported decision to terminate federal \napproval for the Program and rescind the VPPP Agreement is null, void, and must be set aside, \n  20   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 21 of 119\n \nand for vacatur of the February 19 Letter. \nPARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE \n41.

New York Passes the Traffic Mobility Act as the Solution to the New York City Area’s \nLongstanding Congestion Problems \n51.  Traffic congestion has long plagued the New York metropolitan area.  For decades, \ncongestion has stymied economic growth and harmed the environment and public health, as well \nas quality of life in the region.   \n52.  Congestion on New York City roads, and in the CBD in particular, has a serious \nnegative impact on public health.  As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has \nrecognized, higher vehicle traffic leads to higher vehicle emissions, which are associated with \nnegative health impacts like “asthma onset and aggravation, cardiovascular disease, reduced lung \nfunction, impaired lung development in children, pre-term and low-birthweight infants, childhood \n  22   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 23 of 119\n \nleukemia, and premature death.”26  FHWA has consistently acknowledged that “less vehicle traffic \ncan improve air quality and reduce chronic lower respiratory diseases.”27  \n53.  Congestion also increases travel times, eroding worker productivity, reducing bus \nand paratransit service, raising the cost of deliveries, and impeding the movement of emergency \nvehicles.  A 2018 study estimated that “traffic congestion [would] be a $100 billion drag” on the \nmetropolitan-area economy over the next five years, and identified Manhattan below 60th street—\nwhere a quarter of the economic activity is concentrated—as the primary source of traffic \ncongestion in the region.28   \n54.  As noted above, the concept of congestion pricing was first developed in the 1950s \nby Nobel laureate and Columbia University economist William S. Vickrey, who believed that it \noffered a market-based solution to overcrowding, whether on subway cars or New York City’s \nstreets.  Responding to concerns that some might see congestion pricing “as a tax increase,” \nProfessor Vickrey explained that “when motorists’ time is considered, it’s really a savings.”29   \n55.  In 1959, Professor Vickrey testified before the Congressional Joint Committee on \nWashington Metropolitan Problems to outline “pricing solutions to urban transport problems,” \nincluding a tolling scheme that would later be described as congestion pricing.30  During his \ntestimony, Vickrey stated, “[i]t is a specific feature of the pricing system suggested here that it is \n \n26 OFF.

In 1975, Singapore, a small island city-state long plagued by congestion, first put \nProfessor Vickrey’s ideas into practice by implementing its famous Area Licensing Scheme, \npursuant to which vehicles entering Singapore’s Central Business District were required to pay a \ndaily toll.34  Singapore’s Area Licensing Scheme was a success and is widely credited with \ndramatically reducing traffic in Singapore’s central business district, even as the nation’s economy \nand population have continued to grow.35 \n57.  In 2003, London put Professor Vickrey’s idea into practice and moved forward with \na congestion pricing program of its own.  The program was an immediate success.  Within the first \nyear of its implementation, London saw a 30% reduction in congestion within the charging zone \nand an 18% reduction in the number of vehicles entering the zone. 36  The city also experienced \nsignificant increases in the number of commuters choosing to use public transit, including a 38% \n \n31 Id. at 47. \n32 Id.  \n33 Id.  \n34 Kian-Keong Chin, Road Pricing – Singapore’s 30 Years of Experience, CESIFO DICE REPORT (2005), \nhttps://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/166848/1/ifo-dice-report-v03-y2005-i3-p12-16.pdf. \n35 Id. \n36 Transp.

In 2006, Stockholm implemented a congestion charge for its central business \ndistrict on a six-month trial basis, after which citizens would be given a chance to vote on the \nprogram’s future.  On the eve of launch, fewer than 40% of Stockholm residents supported the \nplan.39  Following implementation of the program, however, Stockholm experienced a 20% \ndecrease in traffic volumes and popular support for the program began to surge.  After the trial \nexpired, a referendum to make the program permanent passed in 2007, and public support for the \nprogram rose to over 65%.40 \n59.  In 2011, the people of Milan passed a referendum authorizing Area C, a new \ncongestion pricing toll for vehicles entering the city’s central business district. 41   Under an earlier \nversion of the program, introduced in 2008, higher polluting vehicles were charged for access to \nthe central business district, while less polluting vehicles were able to enter for free.  Area C was \nenacted to further reduce traffic congestion in the central business district by tolling vehicles that \nenter the district.  Area C caused a 28% decrease in road congestion, a 24% reduction in road \ncasualties, and significant decreases in pollutants.42  \n60.  The last decade has seen further recognition of the benefits that a congestion pricing \nprogram could have for reducing congestion in New York City, improving air quality, and raising \n \n37 Id. \n38 See Sam Schwartz et al., A Comprehensive Transportation Policy for the 21st Century, 17 N.Y.U.

As New Yorkers faced serious mass transit issues in 2017, then-\nGovernor Cuomo raised the possibility of implementing a congestion pricing program that would \nhelp fund improvements to New York City’s public transit infrastructure.  Governor Cuomo \ninstituted an advisory panel which recommended a congestion pricing program. \n61.  In 2019, the New York State Legislature enacted the TMA, which authorized and \ndirected TBTA to implement a congestion tolling program in the CBD.  N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law \n§ 1701 et seq.  The TMA’s legislative findings declare that traffic in New York—which “ranks \nsecond worst among cities in the United States and third worst among cities in the world” and is \nestimated to cost the metropolitan economy more than “one hundred billion dollars over the next \nfive years”—is “crippling … [for] residents, commuters, taxi and for-hire vehicle traffic, bus transit \nand emergency services” and “a significant contributor to decreased air quality.”  Id. § 1701.   \n62.  The Legislature further found that the underfunding of New York City’s aging \nsubway infrastructure has “a deleterious impact on the health, safety, and livelihood of commuters, \ntourists, resident New Yorkers” as well as “the economy of the state of New York,” such that “a \nlong-term and sustainable solution is necessary in order to ensure stable and reliable funding” for \nthis “important mass transit asset.”  Id.  Consequently, the Legislature declared that to ensure the \n“public health and safety of New York’s residents,” the creation of a congestion pricing program \nin the Manhattan CBD was “a matter of substantial state concern.”  Id. \n63.  The TMA authorizes and directs TBTA to “establish the central business district \ntolling program,” id. § 1704 (1), grants TBTA the power “to establish and charge variable tolls and \nfees for vehicles entering or remaining in the [CBD],”43 and authorizes TBTA “to make rules and \n \n43 As delineated by the Act, the CBD encompasses the geographic area of Manhattan south and inclusive of 60th \nStreet, but not including the FDR Drive, the West Side Highway, the Battery Park Underpass, and any surface roadway \nportion of the Hugh L.

Congestion Pricing Tolling Authority Under the Federal Value Pricing Pilot Program \n64.  Because Congestion Pricing would impose a toll on several federal-aid highways \nin Manhattan, the federal government has taken the position that the Program could not begin \nwithout federal approval.  Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL 3251732, \nat *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2024) (Liman, J.).  \n65.  The authority of the States to impose tolls on roadways within their borders has \nbeen recognized since the early days of the Republic, and the Supreme Court has consistently held \nas a matter of history and tradition that each State, as a coequal sovereign, is “empowered” to \nimpose “uniform, fair and practical” tolls “for the privilege of using its roads.”  Evansville-\nVanderburgh Airport Auth. Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U.S. 707, 715 (1972) (collecting \ncases); see also Cong. Rsch. Serv., R43575, Tolling U.S. Highways 1–3 (Aug. 26, 2016). \n66.  When Congress established the forerunner of today’s federal-aid highway program \nin 1916, it determined that highways built under that program should be free from tolls.  But that \ngeneral rule, which is today codified at 23 U.S.C. § 301, was almost immediately the subject of \nnumerous carve outs, see, e.g., Oldfield Act of 1927, Pub. L. 69-773 (Mar. 3, 1927) (permitting \nthe use of federal funds to build toll bridges), and today tolls are permitted on federal-aid highways \nunder a wide variety of statutory exceptions, including exceptions that authorize tolling on new \ninfrastructure, tolling on additional lanes added to existing highways, tolling on construction and \n  27   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 28 of 119\n \nconversion of toll-free highways to toll highways, and tolling in connection with high-occupancy \nvehicle lanes, see, e.g., 23 U.S.C. §§ 129, 166.44 \n67.  One such exception is the VPPP, which was enacted into law as the “Congestion \nPricing Pilot Program” as part of ISTEA, a watershed transportation reform bill sponsored and led \nby U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York.  As Congress explained in enacting ISTEA, its \nintention was to foster sweeping change in the nation’s transportation networks in order to \n“develop a National Intermodal Transportation System” consisting “of all forms of transportation \nin a unified, interconnected manner,” which “shall include significant improvements in public \ntransportation necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, \ninternational competitiveness, and mobility.”  ISTEA § 2 (emphasis added).  To this end, among \nother things, Congress included in ISTEA substantial funding for mass transit programs, which \nCongress found to be an integral part of the “National Intermodal Transportation System,” id., and \n“granted states ‘greater flexibility to operate toll facilities and use toll revenues for a variety of \ntransportation projects’” including congestion pricing programs.  Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL 5199945, at *33 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (Liman, J.) (quoting Am. \nTrucking Assn’s, Inc. v. N.Y. State Thruway Auth., 886 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir. 2018)).  As President \nBush explained when signing ISTEA into law, a “major element” of the legislation was “to provide \nState  and  local  officials  unprecedented  flexibility,”  including  the  discretion  to  finance \ntransportation  improvements  “with  toll  revenue”  and  to  use  transportation  funds  “on  the \nimprovements that [will] best meet local needs, whether highway projects or public transit \n \n44  See  also  OFF.

Consistent with these objectives, ISTEA greatly expanded the circumstances in \nwhich States could collect toll revenues on federal-aid highways.  In Section 1012(a) of ISTEA \n(codified, as amended, at 23 U.S.C. § 129), Congress permitted the collection of tolls on new or \nreconstructed infrastructure, including highways, bridges, or tunnels.  See ISTEA § 1012(a)(1).   \n69.  In Section 1012(b) of ISTEA (codified, as amended, at 23 U.S.C. § 149 note), \nCongress authorized the creation of a separate tolling program, the Congestion Pricing Pilot \nProgram, renamed the VPPP in 1998.  Pursuant to Section 1012(b), Congress directed the \nSecretary of Transportation to “solicit the participation of State and local governments and public \nauthorities for one or more congestion pricing pilot programs,” and authorized him to “enter into” \nagreements to “establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing projects.”  ISTEA § 1012(b).45   \n70.  Section 1012(b) further authorized the Secretary “to allow the use of tolls” by \nstates, local governments, and public authorities “as part of a pilot program under this section.”  \nId. § 1012(b)(4).  In contrast to Section 1012(a), Congress imposed notably fewer restrictions on \nthe use of tolling revenue generated under the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program pursuant to \nSection 1012(b), requiring only that “[r]evenues generated by any pilot project” be “applied to \nprojects eligible under” Title 23.  Id. § 1012(b)(3).  Transit capital projects are eligible for federal \nassistance under 23 U.S.C. § 142(a)(2).  ISTEA also provided that the Secretary must periodically \nreport on the effects that VPPP projects have on not only congestion but also “transit ridership … \nand availability of funds for transportation programs.”  ISTEA § 1012(b)(5).  \n \n45 See also 49 C.F.R. § 1.85(c)(22).  FHWA provides tolling authority under the VPPP by entering into tolling \nagreements with the relevant state actors.  See Value Pricing Pilot Program Participation, Fiscal Years 2010 and \n2011, 75 F.R. 64397, 64403 (Nov. 19, 2010). \n  29   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 30 of 119\n \n71.  In a different section of ISTEA, Congress made clear that it expected, and indeed \nrequired, that States should consider congestion pricing programs as a means of generating revenue \nfor  public  transit  projects.    Section  1025  of  ISTEA  directed  States,  in  coordination  with \nmetropolitan planning organizations, to “undertake a continuous transportation planning process \nwhich shall” consider “the use of innovative mechanisms for financing projects, including … \ncongestion pricing.”  ISTEA § 1025(c)(16).   \n72.  Although “congestion pricing” was not defined in ISTEA, the concept was then \n(and is today) commonly understood worldwide to include cordon pricing.  Indeed, Singapore had \nalready been using such a form of congestion pricing at the time ISTEA was passed for nearly two \ndecades.  And in 1987, just a few years before the enactment of ISTEA, New York City Mayor Ed \nKoch testified before a Congressional subcommittee about a congestion pricing proposal in New \nYork City that would charge drivers entering Manhattan’s central business district $10 per day.  \nOzone and Carbon Monoxide Problems: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Health and Env’t of \nthe H. Comm. on Energy & Commerce, 100 Cong. 55 (1987).  \n73.  This is confirmed by statements in the legislative record when ISTEA was enacted \nin 1991, and reinforced by Congress’s subsequent re-enactments (and indeed expansion) of \ncongestion pricing in 1995, 1998, and 2005, reflecting a clear  common understanding that \ncongestion pricing includes cordon pricing and contemplates as a goal the raising of revenue to \npromote public transit (and so further reduce congestion).  See Pub. L. 104-59, § 325(e) (Nov. 28, \n1995); Pub. L. 105-178, § 1216(a) (June 9, 1998); Pub. L. 105-206, § 9006(b) (July 22, 1998); \nPub. L. 109-59, § 1604(a) (Aug. 10, 2005).  Not once has Congress questioned FHWA’s now-\nprior interpretation of the VPPP (discussed infra) or sought to amend the statute to prohibit cordon \npricing or the generation of revenue for mass transit through tolling authorized under the VPPP. \n  30   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 31 of 119\n \n74.  During legislative  deliberations regarding  ISTEA in 1991, Senator  Moynihan \nexplained that the goal was to permit States to launch “innovative congestion pricing experiments” \nof different varieties.  137 Cong. Rec. S18203-02 (daily ed. Nov. 26, 1991).  On March 21, 1991, \nat a hearing of the Subcommittee on Water Resources, Transportation, and Infrastructure on \n“Congestion Pricing and Infrastructure Financing,” convened by Senator Moynihan in advance of \nthe introduction of ISTEA, the Subcommittee took testimony from experts on cordon pricing \ninitiatives implemented by Singapore and Hong Kong, which Senator Joe Lieberman noted \nfavorably in his remarks, stating that he was “particularly interested in the congestion-pricing \nmethods suggested by our hearing witnesses today.”  Congestion Pricing and Infrastructure \nFinancing: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Water Res., Transp., and Infrastructure of the S. \nComm. on Env’t & Pub. Works, 102 Cong. 9 (1991).46  Senator Moynihan agreed that cordon \npricing appeared to be a promising avenue for experimentation: “Singapore is doing it, Hong Kong \nis doing it, we are talking about it.”  Id. at 24.  Senator David Durenberger likewise recognized \nthat “congestion pricing may also be an important means which some cities will employ to reduce \nair quality problems and ease gridlock.”  Id.  at 3.  Don Pickrell, an economist for USDOT at the \ntime, encouraged Congress to “remove any remaining restrictions on … pricing of highways \nconstructed with Federal financial assistance” and to promote measures including “downtown \nlicensing requirements, ala Singapore,” i.e., cordon pricing.  Id. at 18.  When the Subcommittee \nreconvened four days later on March 25, 1991, Peter Mieszkowski, a professor of economics at \nRice University, cautioned in his testimony that imposing congestion tolls only on freeways would \n \n46 From July 1983 to March 1985, the British Government of the Territory of Hong Kong implemented a 21-month \ncongestion pricing trial program, which charged vehicles for entering congested portions of the city.   Although the \nprogram was generally perceived as successful, it was not continued at the end of the trial period due to a variety of \nreasons, including protests, an increase in roadway capacity, and the beginning of the political transition from British \nto Chinese governance. \n  31   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 32 of 119\n \nbe ineffective “because people will simply leave the freeway” and “go to the other access roads, \nwhich will themselves become very congested.  So the congestion policy I think has to be general.”  \nReauthorization of the Federal-Aid Highway Program: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on Env’t & \nPub. Works and the Subcomm. on Water Res., Transp., and Infrastructure, 102 Cong. 40 (1991).  \nSenator Moynihan responded: “Well, you [meaning, local leaders] have got to figure it out \nyourself.  But, yes, not just limit it to some particular Federal road, right.”  Id. (emphasis added).   \n75.  Further evidence that Congress understood “congestion pricing” to include cordon \npricing can be found in the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549 \n(Nov. 15, 1990), which was enacted into law just one year before ISTEA.  In that bill, the Clean \nAir Act was amended to require the EPA Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of \nTransportation, to provide transportation agencies information regarding the formulation and \nemission reduction potential of “transportation control measures,” including “programs to limit or \nrestrict vehicle use in downtown areas or other areas of emission concentration particularly during \nperiods of peak use.”  42 U.S.C. § 7408(f)(1)(A).  During a September 1989 hearing before the \nSenate Subcommittee on Environmental Protection, several witnesses objected to the inclusion of \n“transportation control measures” such as tolling vehicles “to enter central business districts.”  \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1989: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Env’t Protection of the S. \nComm. of Env’t & Pub. Works, 101 Cong. 67-68 (1989) (testimony of Regina McLaurin, President \nof the National Parking Association and Ethan Geto of the Coalition for Improved Transportation \nand Air Quality).  Senators Max Baucus and Lieberman, who were members of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works that oversaw the passage of ISTEA, both rejected the witnesses’ \nconcerns with the inclusion of transportation control measures, noting that localities needed \nflexibility when addressing traffic congestion and air pollution.  Id. at 70 (remarks of Senator \n  32   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 33 of 119\n \nBaucus); id. at 72-73 (remarks of Senator Lieberman).  The language to which the witnesses \nobjected was included in the final text of the bill and remains in force today. \n76.  Moreover, as the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ report on \nISTEA explained, the purpose of the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program was to allow states to \n“establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing programs” and to study, among other things, \nthe effects of such programs on “the availability of funds for transportation programs.”  S. Rep. \nNo. 102-71, at 26 (1991).  That same report noted that the bill was intended to place “[i]ncreased \nemphasis” on the “use of innovative financing mechanisms including … congestion pricing.”  Id.  \nIn other words, everyone, including the relevant members of Congress, understood that congestion \npricing included cordon pricing, and that this form of tolling could reduce congestion and fund \npublic  transit  alternatives—exactly  as  Congress  desired  in  giving  States  broad  leeway  in \nexperimenting with ways to solve the problem, including through tolling under the VPPP. \n77.  This ordinary meaning of “congestion pricing” was consistently echoed by FHWA \nitself from the early 1990s until early 2025.  In congressional testimony provided in 1992 shortly \nafter ISTEA was enacted, FHWA was asked by Senator Lautenberg: “How is FHWA defining \ncongestion pricing projects?”  Dep’t of Transp. & Related Agencies Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n1993: Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the S. Comm. on Appropriations, 102 Cong. 352 (1992).  \nFHWA responded that it “intend[ed] to define congestion pricing projects to provide useful \ndemonstrations of congestion pricing concepts,” and noted that the “potential scope of congestion \npricing applications can vary widely, ranging from pricing on a new or existing single road facility \nto more comprehensive area-wide road pricing strategies.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n78.  In 1998, Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of \n1998, which renamed the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program the “Value Pricing Pilot Program” and \n  33   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 34 of 119\n \nexpanded  the  Secretary’s  authority  to  enter  into  agreements  authorizing  value  pricing  pilot \nprograms.  Pub. L. 105-178 § 1216 (June 9, 1998).  As FHWA has explained, “value pricing” is a \nsynonym for congestion pricing, and the agency often uses the two terms interchangeably.47  \nLikewise, the House Conference report confirms that, in renaming the “Congestion Pricing Pilot \nProgram the VPPP, Congress did not intend to alter the scope of the statute.”  See H.R. CONF. \nREP. 105-550, 407, 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. 70, 79 (referring to past projects authorized under the \nCongestion Pricing Pilot Program as “value pricing projects”).  If anything, Congress intended to \nbroaden the scope of the program to provide “additional flexibility.”  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. \nH10497 (Oct. 10, 1998) (extraneous matter submitted by Representative Shuster). \n79.  Contemporaneous  with  this  new  statutory  enactment,  FHWA  issued  a  VPPP \nfactsheet (“1998 VPPP Fact Sheet”)  explaining that VPPP projects “have the flexibility to \nencompass a variety of value pricing applications, including areawide pricing….”48  Another 1998 \nFHWA publication in the Federal Register (the “1998 FR Notice”) identified “[a]pplications of \nvalue pricing which are comprehensive, such as areawide pricing, [and] pricing of multiple \nfacilities or corridors,” as meriting “highest priority for Federal support” under the VPPP.  63 Fed. \nReg. 53487 (Oct. 5, 1998) (emphasis added).  FHWA went on to note that “[m]ore limited \napplications of value pricing are also acceptable,” indicating that FHWA viewed areawide or \ncordon pricing schemes as the intended primary focus of the VPPP.  Id.  The Notice explained that \nFHWA would give special priority to “[p]rojects which indicate that revenues will be used to \nsupport the goals of the value pricing program,” and “projects that lead to substantial congestion \n \n47 See, e.g., FED.

In 1999, FHWA published “A Guide to Federal Aid Programs and Projects” (“1999 \nVPPP Guide”), which listed “area-wide pricing” as the first example of a VPPP concept, as well \nas a VPPP “Notice of Grant Opportunities” (“1999 VPPP NOGO”), which listed “areawide value \npricing” as a “project of interest,” and explained that such projects include “[f]ees for entering an \narea, sometimes called cordon crossing charges, using electronic vehicle identification devices.”50  \nThe 1999 VPPP NOGO also listed “revenue generation” as a potential benefit of VPPP projects \nand noted that “[p]roposals with the greatest potential to reduce congestion and advance current \nknowledge of price effects, operations, enforcement, revenue generation, equity mitigation and \nmonitoring/evaluation mechanisms will be given the highest priority.”51  Indeed, that notice \nrecognized that existing projects were already “generating revenues that c[ould] be used to further \nenhance urban mobility.”52   \n81.  A May 2001 notice soliciting applications for participation in the VPPP again \nclassified “applications of value pricing which are comprehensive, such as area wide pricing,” as \namong the projects that would “receive highest priority for Federal support.”  66 Fed.

Reg. 970 (Jan. 6, 2006) (emphases added).  \nSimilarly, a 2006 FHWA report on the VPPP also underscored the role of tolls in metropolitan \nareas to support transit infrastructure, emphasizing that “[v]alue priced tolls on existing or new \nhighway lanes in currently congested metropolitan areas can provide a significant source of user-\nbased revenue to pay for the high costs of improving or expanding transportation infrastructure,” \nparticularly where local governments are seeking to make up for shortfalls in revenue.57 \n85.  New York City’s own history with FHWA further demonstrates that, as FHWA has \nlong recognized, cordon pricing and revenue generation are permitted by the VPPP.   \n86.  In April 2007, then-mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed an $8 toll on all vehicles \nentering Manhattan below 86th Street.58  New York City and FHWA entered into an Urban \nPartnership Agreement (“UPA”), attached hereto as Exhibit F, in which FHWA agreed to award \nNew York City $5 million in VPPP funding to pursue “a broad area pricing system in Manhattan \nsouth of 86th Street.”  UPA at 3.  Once implemented, vehicles would be charged a toll for entering, \nexiting, or driving within the congestion zone.  Id.  FHWA highlighted this project repeatedly \nthroughout its 2009 report to Congress on the VPPP, lauding it as a “historic” proposal and the \n \n57 U.S. DEP’T OF TRANSP., Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program Through April 2006 at 4 (Feb. 11 2022), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/index.htm.  \n58 Maria Newman, Mayor Proposes a Fee for Driving in to Manhattan, N.Y.

Congress was well aware of the New York City’s 2007 proposal and discussed it at \nlength during a June 7, 2007 House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure hearing on “Congestion and Mobility” in order “to receive \ntestimony on the problem of congestion facing our nation’s surface transportation system and some \nof the options to deal with the problem.”61  Notably, the Subcommittee’s report emphasized the \nproblem of congestion in urban areas and observed that one option, “congestion pricing,” “can be \nimplemented in several different forms,” including “impos[ing] tolls … around a specified area \nsuch [as] the downtown of a city, or over a wider region.”62  During the hearing, Federal Transit \nAdministrator James Simpson, nominated by President Bush, was asked to share the “best idea” \nthat he had heard recently that would “make the most improvement” in managing congestion, and \nhe replied “New York is really bold.  What they are proposing now … [is] to have an access fee, \nsimilar to London, south of 86th Street to Lower Manhattan to free up maybe 5 or 10 percent of the \ntraffic.”63  Administrator Simpson also observed that “the beauty of this program is whatever we \ninvest in now … this congestion pricing will throw off about $300 million a year to finance such \n \n59 FED.

Also in 2005, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (“SFCTA”) \nreceived a $1,040,000 VPPP grant to evaluate the feasibility of area or cordon pricing for San \nFranscico (the “San Francisco Project”).65  The San Franscisco Project included a Northeast \nQuadrant cordon/area-wide pricing concept with no toll-free routes to enter the congestion zone.66  \nA key goal of the San Francisco Project was to develop a comprehensive transportation system \nmanagement strategy, which “not only contemplates congestion charging, but also focuses on the \nimprovement of competitive alternatives to driving by using the revenues generated through \npricing to support investments in transit, bicycling, and walking.”67  With this goal in mind, the \nSan Francisco Project study concluded that options involving a smaller cordon would not generate \nenough revenue to “enhance travel options.”68   \n \n64 Id.  \n65 SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSP.

By 2009, FHWA continued to lament, in its report to Congress, that “the projects \nimplemented so far have not had significant impacts on congestion or the other objectives of the \nVPPP because they typically only involve ‘partial’ pricing of a highway facility,” while the VPPP \n“initially contemplated” “more comprehensive pricing strategies.”73  “To further the VPPP’s \nobjectives,” FHWA wrote: \nThe VPPP portfolio of implemented projects should include pilot \nimplementations of broad congestion pricing projects involving tolls \non all lanes of a highway facility, all roads in a congested area, or \nall roads of an entire roadway network.  Such approaches tend to \ntake away the choice to drive alone for free in a congested area.74   \n \n92.

Similarly, a 2016 FHWA report to Congress on the status of the VPPP described \n“efforts and initiatives to effectively support and mainstream congestion pricing” as a “focal point \nfor FHWA programs.”86  FHWA anticipated that more ambitious “second-generation” projects \nwould rise in prominence under the VPPP in coming years, noting that they “are likely to combine \nregionwide pricing strategies, such as vehicle miles traveled fees, cordon pricing, and regional \npricing, along with a non-toll blueprint.”87  FHWA even singled out New York City specifically \nas likely to benefit from “some form of cordon pricing.”88  \n \n85 TREASURE ISLAND MOBILITY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, Treasure Island Mobility Management Study Summary \nReview 1 (July 2016), https://www.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/2019-\n03/TIMM%20Study%20Summary%20Report.pdf. \n86 FED.

This is confirmed by more recent congressional consideration of tolling under the \nVPPP.  Shortly after the passage of the TMA, on September 11, 2019, the House Subcommittee \non Highways and Transit held a hearing on “Pricing and Technology Strategies to Address \nCongestion,” which included a discussion of the Program and the TMA itself.  In the summary \nprepared by committee staff prior to the hearing, congestion pricing is defined as “a variably-\npriced lane, such as an Express Lane or HOT Lane; a variable toll on an entire roadway or facility; \nor a cordon charge that is levied on drivers to enter or move within a specifically-designated \narea.”89  The summary noted that “the VPPP allows toll revenues to be used on projects eligible \nunder Title 23,” which includes public transit projects.90  The Committee’s final report on the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 makes clear the Committee’s understanding that \nISTEA “clearly states” that revenue generated by a pilot project can and should be used for \n“projects  eligible  under  title  23”  including  “transit  safety  infrastructure  improvements  and \nprograms” and “for new transit service, system or service expansion”: \nIt  is  the  sense  of  the  Committee  that  the  Department  of \nTransportation carry out the Value Pricing Pilot Program consistent \nwith  the  statutory  requirements  of  that  program  and  the \nDepartment’s  longstanding  interpretation  of  title  23.    Section \n1012(b)(3) of ISTEA, as amended, clearly states that any project \nrevenues in excess of pilot project operating costs may be used for \nany projects eligible under title 23.  Under 23 USC 133(b)(4), \n“transit  safety  infrastructure  improvements  and  programs”  are \neligible under the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, and \nit has been FHWA’s longstanding interpretation that Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality funds may be used for new transit \nservice,  system  or  service  expansion,  new  vehicles,  and  fare \nsubsidies, if such projects or programs improve air quality. \n \nH.

In 2021, the Utah Department of Transportation submitted an Expression of Interest \nfor a project aimed at reducing congestion at Little Cottonwood Canyon, including a cordon \npricing component.91  Specifically, under four alternatives studied in the project’s Environmental \nImpact Statement (“EIS”), a toll or a ban on single-occupant vehicles would be implemented on \nS.R. 210—the only available route connecting the area’s ski resorts and Little Cottonwood \nCanyon.92  The EIS for the Little Cottonwood Canyon project notes that tolling revenue may be \nused for “the operation and maintenance costs of the transit system to reduce fares to make transit \nan attractive option to paying a toll.”93  FHWA noted this project in its most recent report to \nCongress on the VPPP submitted in 2023.94 \n98.  FHWA’s current guidance and website reinforces the longstanding commonsense \nproposition that congestion pricing includes cordon pricing and has as a goal revenue generation \nto  support  public  transit.

Carey Tunnel connecting to West Street) in order to reduce the severe congestion \nin the CBD.  In addition, it was explained that the Program would incorporate toll rates that would \nprovide a new and recurring source of revenue for the MTA, with net revenues (after paying for \nProgram operational costs) to be dedicated to capital improvements identified in the MTA’s 2020-\n2024 Capital Plan.  USDOT and FHWA representatives made clear at these meetings that, given \nthe nature of the Program, the VPPP is the appropriate vehicle to provide tolling authority on \nfederal-aid highways for a cordon-based congestion pricing project like the Program.  The federal \nagencies explained that NYSDOT already had one of the 15 “slots” allotted in the VPPP and could \nhave multiple congestion pricing projects under that “slot,” including the Program.  USDOT and \nFHWA further explained that there would need to be a VPPP agreement between FHWA and the \nProject Sponsors.  At a meeting on April 24, 2019, it was agreed that FHWA would forward to the \nProject Sponsors a template for a VPPP Expression of Interest, which was needed to commence \n  48   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 49 of 119\n \nthe approval process under the VPPP, as well as an example of an agreement that the Project \nSponsors would need to enter into with FHWA once approved. \n103.  On June 17, 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted the EoI, Exhibit A, seeking \nauthorization to implement a variable tolling program aimed at reducing congestion (i.e., a \ncongestion pricing program) in the CBD.  The EoI explained that the Project Sponsors sought \n“approval under the Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP) to initiate a variable tolling program \nwithin the Manhattan Central Business District (CBD), generally defined as the area of Manhattan \nsouth and inclusive of 60th Street.”  EoI at 1.  The EoI was clear that the Project Sponsors \ncontemplated implementing a cordon pricing program, noting that “[v]ehicles would be charged a \ntoll to enter or remain within the Manhattan CBD” and that “vehicles would be charged to enter \nor remain within a specific area.”  Id. at 3-4.  The Project Sponsors were likewise clear that \ngenerating revenue for mass transit was another goal of the Program, noting that “revenues \ngenerated by the program would be used to construct, operate and maintain the CBD toll collection \nprogram and modernize the MTA transit system, with the goal of attracting new riders and further \nreducing vehicle demand for scarce road capacity in and connecting to the Manhattan CBD.”  Id. \nat 4; see also id. at 3 (“Revenue raised by the program will provide sustained funding for public \ntransportation, which as it becomes more reliable, will contribute to congestion relief.”).  As the \nProject Sponsors explained, “[b]y creating a new sustainable revenue source, the CBD tolling \nprogram would enable the MTA to invest in improving its transportation network, which in turn, \nwould support the program’s goals of increasing transit ridership and improving transit services \nfor low-income residents.”  Id. at 6.  The EoI did not contemplate an end date for the Program, but \ninstead stated that the Project Sponsors would prepare reports on “the effects of the program” once \n“every two years … for the life of the program.”  Id. at 6. \n  49   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 50 of 119\n \n104.  On October 24, 2019, then FHWA Administrator Nicole R. Nason, nominated by \nPresident Trump during his first term, responded to the Project Sponsor’s EoI in a letter addressed \nto the Executive Deputy Commissioner of NYSDOT (“FHWA Response”), attached hereto as \nExhibit G.  According to the Trump Administration at the time, “[u]nder the various programs in \nFederal law that allow tolling of existing infrastructure, the VPPP appears to be the best potential \nfit.”  FHWA Response at 1.   \n105.  Following  FHWA’s  response  to  the  EoI,  a  years-long  environmental  review \nprocess under NEPA ensued.  In assessing the Program, FHWA specifically considered the \nProgram’s purpose “to reduce traffic congestion in the [CBD] in a manner that will generate \nrevenue for future transportation improvements,” and its specific objectives of: (1) reducing daily \nVMT within the CBD by at least five percent; (2) reducing the number of vehicles entering the \nCBD daily by at least ten percent; and (3) creating a funding source for capital improvements and \ngenerating sufficient annual net revenues to fund $15 billion for capital projects.101  \n106.  On August 10, 2022, FHWA and the Project Sponsors issued a Draft Environmental \nAssessment (“Draft EA”), which was informed by early public outreach and comments as well as \ncomplex and comprehensive technical analyses.  The Draft EA identified the Program’s dual \nobjectives; the primary objective of congestion reduction and the complementary objective of \nproviding a reliable source of funding for capital public transit projects.  It examined numerous \ncategories of potential environmental effects, such as the visual effects of tolling infrastructure, \nthe indirect air quality and noise effects of changes in traffic patterns, and the effects on transit \nsystems of shifts in travel mode choice.  In accordance with former Executive Order (“EO”) 12,898 \n \n101 See FED. HIGHWAY ADMIN. et al., Central Business District Tolling Program, Finding of No Significance, Appendix \nA: Final Environmental Assessment at ES-6 (June 14, 2024), https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/environmental-\nassessment.  \n  50   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 51 of 119\n \n(1994), the Draft EA also studied the potential for disproportionately high and adverse effects on \nEJ communities, including the potential effects of traffic diversions on local air quality in the \nlocations throughout the region most likely to experience diversions. \n107.  Because the tolling structure was not yet established when the Draft EA was issued, \nand in order to allow FHWA and the Project Sponsors to better assess the range of potential \nimpacts from the Program, the Draft EA analyzed seven tolling scenarios, each with different \nvariables, using EPA-approved traffic and air quality models to predict changes in regional travel \ndemand and patterns for those scenarios, as compared to predicted conditions in 2023 and 2045 \nwithout the Program.  It then studied the scenarios that yielded the representative worst-case effects \nfor different resource categories (e.g., traffic, noise, etc.) to consider the full range of potential \neffects  from  the  Program.    The  Draft  EA  also  identified  measures  to  mitigate  potential \ndisproportionate and adverse environmental effects and potential effects on EJ populations that \nwere identified in the analyses. \n108.  FHWA and the Project Sponsors provided a 44-day public comment period, during \nwhich anyone could submit comments on the Draft EA.  In late August 2022, FHWA and the \nProject Sponsors held six virtual public hearings, totaling over 38 hours, to discuss the Draft EA.  \nThis was in addition to early outreach conducted while the Draft EA was in development, and \nspecial  outreach  to  communities  and  organizations,  including  multiple  meetings  to  discuss \nenvironmental justice in relation to the Program.  \n109.  On March 30, 2021, while working with the Project Sponsors, then-Acting FHWA \nAdministrator Stephanie Pollack commended the Program, saying: “The FHWA looks forward to \n  51   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 52 of 119\n \nassisting New York so we can arrive at a prompt and informed NEPA determination on this \nimportant and precedent-setting project.”102  \n110.  Between August 2022 and April 2023, FHWA and the Project Sponsors reviewed \nand  prepared  responses  to  each  of  the  thousands  of  comments  and  prepared  a  Final  EA \nincorporating these responses and changes informed by the public input.   \n111.  The Final EA determined that the Program would not have adverse effects on air \nquality because it would not cause exceedances of health-based National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards.  Nevertheless, the Project Sponsors committed to a robust, $155 million mitigation \npackage  over  five  years  to  improve  air  quality  and  public  health  in  EJ  communities  with \npreexisting  pollution  and  health  burdens  throughout  the  region,  with  particular  investments \ndirected to EJ communities in which the Project could cause any increase in truck traffic.   \n112.  The Final EA further predicted that the Program would meet each of the objectives \ndescribed in Paragraph 104 above based on detailed modeling, using the federally approved Best \nPractices Model maintained by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council. \n113.  The Final EA also predicted many beneficial environmental effects of the Program, \nincluding but not limited to: \na.  reducing emissions of harmful air pollutants including volatile organic compounds, \nnitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, carbon dioxide equivalent \n(i.e., greenhouse gases), and Mobile Source Air Toxics, both within the CBD and \nregion-wide, through an overall reduction in VMT region-wide; \n \n102 FED.

In May 2023, FHWA approved the Final EA.  \n115.  Starting on May 12, FHWA made the Final EA and Draft FONSI available for \npublic review for a period of 30 days, from May 12 to June 12, 2023.   \n116.  On June 22, 2023, FHWA issued a FONSI determining that the Program, including \nmitigation, would not have a significant adverse impact on the environment and would not have a \ndisproportionately high and adverse impact on EJ communities or populations.  \n117.  On June 23, 2023, FHWA’s New York Division Administrator signed the FONSI.  \n  53   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 54 of 119\n \n118.  On March 27, 2024, the TBTA Board approved a toll rate schedule through a formal \nratemaking process under New York State law.  \n119.  In June 2024, the Project Sponsors, in consultation with FHWA, completed a \nreevaluation under NEPA (“Reevaluation 1”), which assessed the effects of the approved toll \nstructure.  On June 14, 2024, FHWA concluded that the approved toll structure and associated \nimpacts were analyzed and mitigated appropriately under NEPA, that no additional environmental \nanalysis was warranted, and that the conclusions in the Final EA and FONSI remained valid. \nReevaluation 1 also concluded that the approved toll structure would meet the congestion-\nreduction and revenue goals for the Program and achieve similar environmental benefits to those \ndescribed in the Final EA. \n120.  On June 5, 2024, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a temporary pause \nof the Program.  On November 14, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed that the Program move \nforward with a toll structure approach whereby those toll rates would be phased in gradually over \nthe first several years of the Program (the “Phase-In Approach”), featuring a lower initial toll \namount.   \n121.  In November 2024, the Project Sponsors completed a second reevaluation under \nNEPA (“Reevaluation 2”) to assess the Phase-In Approach.   \n122.  Reevaluation 2 confirmed that under the Phase-In Approach, the Program would \nstill meet its purpose and need, and all of its objectives.  Reevaluation 2 also confirmed that the \nProject  Sponsors  would  still  implement  all  mitigation  commitments,  including  for  EJ \ncommunities, within the same timeframes as contemplated in the Final EA and FONSI.  \n123.  On November 18, 2024, the TBTA Board formally adopted the Phase-In Approach \nto the toll rate schedule. \n  54   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 55 of 119\n \n124.  On November 21, 2024, FHWA approved Reevaluation 2, concluding that the \neffects of the Program were consistent with those disclosed in the EA, that the adopted Phase-In \nApproach of the approved toll structure and impacts associated with it were analyzed and mitigated \naccordingly, and that no additional environmental analysis was warranted.   \nD.  The VPPP Agreement Is Executed by FHWA and the Project Sponsors  \n125.  That same day, on November 21, 2024, FHWA (through Defendant Shepherd) and \nthe Project Sponsors signed an agreement under the VPPP authorizing the Program’s collection of \ntolls and requiring (among other things) implementation of the mitigation commitments made in \nthe FONSI.  \n126.  The VPPP Agreement reflects FHWA’s determination that “this Agreement is \nnecessary to oversee and administer the collection of tolls pursuant to Section 1012(b)(4) of \nISTEA,” VPPP Agmt. at 1, and states in relevant part that “[e]ffective on the date of this Agreement, \nthe project is approved as a pilot program,” id., cl. 8, and that TBTA is authorized to “operate the \nProgram as a toll Project in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and as a value pricing \nproject,” id., cl. 1.  FHWA further agreed that “the imposition of tolls under this Agreement does \nnot render Federal-aid highways within the State of New York generally ineligible for Federal-aid \nhighway funds where such highways are otherwise eligible under the particular funding program.”  \nId., cl. 5.  The VPPP Agreement provides that TBTA may use “toll revenues received from the \noperation of the Project” for, among other things, “any other projects eligible for assistance under \ntitle 23, United States Code.”  Id., cl. 2. \n127.  In return, the Project Sponsors agreed to a number of obligations in the VPPP \nAgreement, including: (1) “to adequately maintain” federal-aid highways located in the geographic \narea of the Program, id., cl. 6; (2) to submit regular reports on the effects of the Program “on driver \nbehavior, traffic volume, congestion, transit ridership” and other topics to FHWA, id., cl. 8(b); and \n  55   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 56 of 119\n \n(3) “to comply with all Federal laws and requirements applicable to this project, including the laws \nand policies applicable to the Value Pricing Pilot Program,” id., cl. 9.  The VPPP Agreement further \nrequires that the Project Sponsors “identify benefits the application of tolls has in reducing climate \npollution”  and  “demonstrate  the  benefits  mitigation  measures  provide  to  underserved \ncommunities.”  Id., cl. 8(d). \n128.  In addition, the VPPP Agreement requires that FHWA and the Project Sponsors \n“will cooperate and work together in the implementation of the Project.”  Id., cl. 8(a). \n129.  The  VPPP  Agreement  does  not  include  any  provision  authorizing  FHWA  to \nterminate the agreement.  Rather, it contemplates that only TBTA could unilaterally decide to \ndiscontinue the Program, requiring the Project Sponsors to “work with FHWA to return the Project \nto its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id., cl. 11 \n(emphasis added).  The VPPP Agreement further provides that TBTA and NYCDOT shall “monitor \nand report on the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the end of the life of \nthe Project, whichever is sooner.”  Id., cl. (8)(b). \n130.  The VPPP Agreement references FHWA regulations at 23 C.F.R. Part 940 and 950.  \nThese regulations do not grant FHWA authority to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement. \nE.  Plaintiffs Successfully Implement the Program After Facing Numerous Lawsuits \nSeeking to Delay or Prevent Congestion Pricing \n131.  Prior to implementation of the Program, TBTA budgeted over $500 million towards \nefforts to establish the Program, and much of that budget has already been expended.  These \nexpenditures included developing the methodological approach; conducting the assessment and \nextensive outreach and developing the final documentation for the environmental review process \nunder NEPA; design, development, implementation, and testing of the roadway infrastructure and \nsystem; design, development, implementation, and testing of the Back Office System; additional \n  56   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 57 of 119\n \nextensive outreach for the State administrative review process; staff costs, including new staff for \nthe Program; and consulting costs.   \n132.  In late 2024, several groups and individuals, as well as the State of New Jersey, \nsought preliminary injunctive relief on various federal and state constitutional and statutory \ngrounds barring the MTA and TBTA from beginning the Program or collecting tolls.  Each of \nthese claims for injunctive relief was rejected by the courts.  See Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 23 Civ. 10365, 2024 WL 5199945 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (Liman, J.) (“Chan”) (111-page \nopinion denying motions for preliminary injunction in four related cases challenging the program); \nsee also County of Rockland v. Metro. Transp. Auth., No. Civ. 24-3325 (2d Cir. Jan. 28, 2025), \nECF 31 (per curiam); New Jersey v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. Civ. 25-1033 (3d Cir. Jan. 4, 2025), \nECF 9 (Bibas, J.); County of Rockland v. Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., No. 24 Civ. 2285 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2025), ECF 56 (Seibel, J.); New Jersey v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. 23 Civ. \n3885 (D.N.J.

Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Auth., No. 24 Civ. 3983 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, \n2024), ECF 44 (Seibel, J.).  In rejecting these plaintiffs’ requests for a preliminary injunction to \nhalt the Program, courts recognized that the equities and public interest favored the Program \nmoving forward, especially in light of the expenditures necessary to implement the Program and \nthe revenues expected from its operation, see, e.g., Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *48-49; that the \nimplementation of the Program reflected a policy choice by New York’s elected representatives, \nsee id. at *48; and that FHWA conducted a thorough analysis in deciding to allow the Program to \nproceed, see id. at *5-10; New Jersey, No. 23 Civ. 3885, ECF 212 at 35. \n  57   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 58 of 119\n \n133.  FHWA and USDOT were named as defendants in several of the above-referenced \ncases.  In the course of defending the Final EA and FONSI, and FHWA’s ultimate approval of the \nProgram, FHWA and USDOT submitted briefs to this Court and others that underscored and \nreiterated FHWA’s longstanding view that cordon pricing programs, including those with a \nrevenue objective, are permissible under the VPPP.   \n134.  In briefs before this Court, FHWA and USDOT described the VPPP as the “means \nby which the FHWA can provide tolling authority to state, regional, or local governments to \nimplement congestion pricing programs.”  Chan, ECF 65 at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThey  explained  that  it was  appropriate  for  FHWA  to  authorize  a  cordon  pricing  program: \n“Although this may be the first time congestion pricing is applied to a city’s central business \ndistrict  (i.e.  ‘cordon  pricing’)  in  the  United  States,  such  projects  have  been  successfully \nimplemented in London, Stockholm, Singapore, and Milan, and information from some of those \nprojects was used to inform the analysis conducted here.”  Chan, ECF 81 at 10; see also id. \n(“[C]ongestion pricing strategies are not novel and the impacts of such strategies on driving \nbehavior, traffic volumes, transit ridership and air quality have been available for review for \nyears.”). \n135.  FHWA and USDOT recognized that the Program’s purpose is to “reduce traffic \ncongestion in the Manhattan CBD in a manner that will generate revenue for future transportation \nimprovements.”  Chan, ECF 65 at 9.  FHWA and USDOT went on to explain that compliance with \nthe TMA’s objective that the Program enable a minimum amount of funding for the MTA Capital \nProgram was not only an “appropriate” consideration in the NEPA process, but also “serves the \nseparation of powers by respecting the democratic legitimacy of legislative judgments,” “promotes \nthe balance of ‘federalism’ by ensuring that federal agencies do not pass judgment on the policy \n  58   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 59 of 119\n \nwisdom of state and local enactments,” and “is pragmatically sensible as well, since it ensures \nfederal agencies do not expend resources examining alternatives that the project sponsors are not \nlegally authorized to implement.” Chan, ECF 160 at 8 (quoting Mulgrew, 2024 WL 3251732, at \n*26). \n136.  One of the plaintiffs that sued to prevent implementation of the Program is, as \nnoted, the State of New Jersey, which sued USDOT and FHWA among others.  On December 30, \n2024, Judge Leo Gordon granted USDOT, FHWA, the MTA, and TBTA’s motions for summary \njudgment in overwhelming part, rejecting New Jersey’s claims that FHWA acted arbitrarily in \nassessing the potential adverse environmental impacts on New Jersey resulting from air pollution \nand identifying and assessing the potential for disproportionately high and adverse impacts on New \nJersey EJ communities.  New Jersey, No. 23 Civ. 3885, ECF 191.  New Jersey also raised concerns \nabout the adequacy of participation afforded to New Jersey entities, officials, and the public \nthroughout the process, and that FHWA had failed to conduct a transportation conformity analysis \nunder the Clean Air Act for the Project with regard to New Jersey’s State Implementation Plan, \nwhich claims the court also rejected.  The court reserved judgment on two issues that it remanded \nto FHWA for further explanation: the amount of place-based mitigation funding allocated to New \nJersey EJ communities to address the former EO 12,898 and the consideration of alternatives in \nlight of the adopted Phase-In Approach.  Id.  The court did not, as sought by New Jersey, vacate \nthe  FONSI  pending  the  completion  of  the  remand.    New  Jersey  subsequently  moved  for \nreconsideration and for a temporary restraining order, which the court denied.  FHWA filed its \nremand results on January 17, 2025, reaffirming the FONSI and Reevaluations, including with \nrespect to the alternatives analysis and the revenue objective.  The remand results are pending sub \njudice before the court. \n  59   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 60 of 119\n \n137.  On January 5, 2025, the Program went into effect.  Vehicles entering the CBD are \nbeing tolled at the rates established in the adopted toll rate schedule. \nF.  Data to Date Indicate that the Program Has Been Successful at Reducing Congestion \nand Is Increasingly Popular with New Yorkers \n138.  While the Program has only recently begun and its full benefits have yet to be \nrealized, it is clearly already working.  A recent study by researchers from the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research and Google Research concluded that the “introduction of congestion pricing \nled  to  an  immediate  increase  in  speeds  within  NYC’s  CBD,  which  has  persisted  since \nimplementation” and estimate “that speeds in NYC’s CBD increased by 15%” on average, and \nthat the “effects on speeds are even larger during the afternoon—historically the most congested \ntime of day—and persist even after peak-hours pricing ends at 9pm.”103  The researchers also \nfound that the Program “had positive spillovers on speeds throughout the NYC metropolitan area” \nand had already led to a small, but noticeable decrease in emissions for vehicles driving in the \nCBD.104  Every day there are close to 60,000 fewer cars in the CBD since tolling began.105  New \nJerseyans driving or commuting by bus are saving as much as 21 minutes on a daily round trip, \nwhile commuters from Queens and Long Island are saving as much as 13 minutes.106  The \nFinancial Times has estimated that “motorists … will save thousands of hours per year they \ncurrently waste crawling through smoggy tunnels or over clogged bridges.”107  This is already \nbeing borne out in the first months since the Program took effect.

Reduced traffic, as a result of \nthe Program, has allowed more of these buses to make it to school on time. \n142.  At the same time, the fact that there are now fewer cars on the road in the CBD has \nnot stymied economic activity.  In fact, data provided by the MTA shows that in January 2025, \n35.8 million people visited BIDs in the CBD, a 1.5 million increase compared to last January.  \nCredit card sales data reflects that retail sales in the CBD have been $900 million higher in 2025 \ncompared to the same period last year.122  Credit card sales data reflects that retail sales in the CBD \nare on pace to be $900 million higher in 2025 compared to the same period last year.123   The gross \nrevenue of Broadway shows in January through March 2025 was 25% higher than in the same \nperiod of last year, while attendance at shows was approximately 20% higher in the first three \nmonths of 2025 compared to the same period of last year. 124  As Governor Hochul recently said, \n“traffic is down and business is up.”125 \n143.

Business leaders have continued to voice their support for the Program since its \nbenefits have truly started to emerge.  For example, Union Square Partnership Executive Director \nJulie Stein said that since the Program began, “average weekday foot traffic in Union Square has \nreached its highest levels for this season in recent history, surpassing both pre-pandemic and \nrecent-year benchmarks for January and February.”129  Stein added that people in the community \nare  saying  that  “Union  Square  feels  more  peaceful  and  pedestrian-friendly  and  surface \ntransportation commuting times into and out of the district have improved.”130  Hudson Square \nBID President and CEO Samara Karasyk said that, because of the Program, “[w]e have already \nseen a tangible decrease in traffic around the Holland Tunnel, which … will help grow the local \neconomy and enhance the vitality of our community.”131 \n \n126  New  York’s  Chamber  (@NYChamber),  X  (Nov.  15,  2024,  3:29  PM), \nhttps://x.com/NYChamber/status/1857521387583451602.  \n127 Dick Brennan, President Trump Said to Have NYC’s Congestion Pricing, Bike Lanes in his Crosshairs, CBS NEWS \n(Feb. 10, 2025), https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/president-trump-nyc-congestion-pricing-bike-lanes/.  \n128 Ry Rivard & Nick Reisman, New York’s Business Boosters Push Trump to Keep Manhattan Tolls, POLITICO (Feb. \n11, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/new-york-trump-congestion-pricing-00203540.  \n129 Traffic Down, Business Up, supra note 125. \n130 Id.  \n131 Id.  \n  64   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 65 of 119\n \n145.  Emergency vehicle speeds and response times obviously benefit from the reduction \nof traffic and lessening of congestion.  For many years, increasing traffic in New York City led to \nlonger and longer emergency vehicle response times.  As documented in a report issued by State \nSenator  Brad  Hoylman-Sigal,  who  represents  much  of  the  CBD,  and  traffic  engineer  Sam \nSchwartz, over the past decade, “E.M.S. response times to life-threatening situations had increased \nby 29%; for Fire Department vehicles tending to medical emergencies, the lag was up by 72 \npercent.”132  Congestion pricing allows emergency vehicles to respond more quickly to calls.  \n146.  Reports also indicate that the Program has made the streets safer; data compiled \nby the New York Police Department reflect decreases in accidents both inside and outside the \nCBD for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024.133  \n147.  Public transit ridership has seen an increase following the implementation of the \nProgram, with 448,000 more riders on average each day choosing to use MTA public transit \noptions as compared to the same period last year.134   \n148.  Crime in the subway has plummeted, even as ridership has increased.  In January \n2025, there were 36% fewer crimes reported on the subway than last January.135  Overall, subway \ncrime is down 22% so far in 2025.136 \n \n132 Ginia Bellfante, The Life-or-Death Consequences of Killing Congestion Pricing, N.Y.

Honking is also down, as New Yorkers in the CBD have actually enjoyed what \nmight be called peace and quiet since the Program went into effect.137  The two Department of \nEnvironmental Protection noise cameras in the CBD have not yet issued a single horn-honking \nsummons since the Program went into effect, whereas 27 were issued during the same time period \nlast year.138  There has also been a 69% decline in complaints about honking to the city’s 311 portal \nfrom citizens living inside the CBD for the same time frame in 2024.139  “Less congestion means \nless noise,” Jaqi Cohen, director of climate and equity policy for Tri-State Transportation Campaign \nexplained, “but I think horn honking is also a symptom of people’s frustration behind the wheel, so \nit probably speaks to the fact that people have easier commutes now.”140 \n150.  Not only has Congestion Pricing created all of these benefits for New Yorkers and \ncommuters, it has also met revenue raising expectations for the MTA’s Capital Program.141   \n151.  According to a poll reported by CBS News, the majority of New Yorkers want the \nProgram to continue,142 and polling indicates that support for the Program continues to grow as \ncommuters see its benefits.143  On a 2-to-1 basis, New Yorkers say that the program is working.144  \n \n137 Jose Martinez & Mia Hollie, Honking Complaints Plunge 69% Inside Congestion Pricing Zone, THE CITY (Mar. \n11, 2025), https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/03/11/traffic-noise-complaints-drop-congestion-pricing/.  \n138 Id.  \n139 Id.  \n140 Id. \n141 Barbara Russo-Lennon, Congestion Pricing: MTA Announces $51.9 Million in Manhattan Toll Revenue for \nFebruary, AMNY (Mar. 24, 2025), https://www.amny.com/news/congestion-pricing-revenue-tolls-february-2025/.  \n142Alecia Reid, 6 in 10 Say They Want NYC Congestion Pricing to Continue, New Poll Finds, CBS NEWS (Feb. 5, \n2025),  https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/newyork/news/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-morning-consult-poll/.  \nAnother poll, run close in time to the Program’s launch, likewise found that a majority of New Yorkers support \ncongestion pricing.

Congressman \nJerry Nadler has stated that “congestion pricing is the best — and only — solution to getting our \ntransit system back on track” and will allow the “MTA to advance work on the 2nd Avenue \nSubway extension, Penn Access, ADA accessibility upgrades, and more.  We will end the \ncongested streets that put public safety and emergency response at risk while meeting our climate \ngoals to fight the climate crisis.”145  Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine has also given his \nstrong support to the Program, stating: “Implementing congestion pricing as soon as possible will \nraise the critical funds we need to build elevators and escalators, modernize signals, and give New \nYorkers the transit system we deserve.”146  Assemblymember Tony Simone from Manhattan \nexpressed a similar sentiment: “There is not, has never been and never will be, a substitute for the \nfunding promised through congestion pricing.  Mass transit is the backbone of our city and state, \nwhich are the economic engine for the nation.  This funding is critical to making our system fully \naccessible, improving service, delivering the infrastructure to increase residential density to \ncombat the housing crisis, create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and induce billions of \ndollars of investment.”147  Elected representatives from boroughs outside of the CBD have also \nexpressed their support for the Program and the benefits it is already incurring.  State Senator \nRobert Jackson, who represents parts of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, stated that “Congestion \npricing is already delivering for New York—easing gridlock, cutting pollution, and powering \ncritical funding for our transit system.”148  Similarly, Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas, \n \n145 Gov.

Walt “Clyde” Frazier, the legendary former point guard for the New York \nKnicks, declared his support for the Program during a recent Knicks game, commenting: “It’s like \ncongestion pricing, Mike, in the paint.  I’m loving the congestion pricing, there’s no traffic man, \nyou can get around now.”150  Nobel laureate and economist Paul Krugman, who lives in New York \nCity, describes the Program as “Economics 101” and has concluded that the Program “has been \nremarkably successful, exceeding even its supporters’ expectations.”151  Illena Robbins, who grew \nup in Manhattan and now lives in Queens, said in an interview with the New York Times that \ncrossing the street to get lunch “would stress me out,” but now that the Program is in effect, she is \n“able to cross safely, and cars weren’t honking.

On  January  11,  then  President-elect  Trump  met  with  Representatives  Nicole \nMalliotakis and Mike Lawler from New York.163  Following the meeting at President Trump’s \nMar-a-Lago Club, Representative Malliotakis posted the following on X: \n \n162 Steven Nelson, Trump Slams Hochul Move to Revive NYC Congestion Tax: ‘It will Hurt Workers, Families, and \nBusinesses’,  N.Y.

The  Administration  Purports  to  “Terminate”  the  VPPP  Agreement  Based  on \nSpurious and Transparently Pretextual Arguments \n161.  On the day of President Trump’s Inauguration, January 20, 2025, New Jersey \nGovernor Phil Murphy made a personal appeal to end the Program.  In a letter to President Trump, \nGovernor Murphy noted the President’s previous characterization of congestion pricing as a \n“disaster” and vow to “TERMINATE” it on his “FIRST WEEK BACK in office!!!”164  \n162.

Similarly, Section 5(f)(iii) of the order requires projects to “mitigate the unique \nimpacts of DOT programs,” such as “the accessibility of transportation to families with young \nchildren.”  The Program meets these goals by generating revenues to install elevators at subway \nstations, improving pedestrian and cyclist safety, and reducing gridlock to improve travel time \nreliability, thereby increasing transportation options for families with young children, while also \nreducing vehicular emissions and financing significant environmental mitigation measures to \nenhance their health.  \n164.  On February 19, 2025, USDOT followed through on the President’s promise to \nattempt to “terminate” congestion pricing by undertaking agency action purporting to rescind the \nVPPP Agreement and revoke federal approval for the Program.   In a letter addressed to Governor \nHochul, Duffy explained that he had been directed by President Trump to “review[] the tolling \nauthority granted under VPPP to the Program pilot project for compliance with Federal law” and \nhad “concluded that the scope of this pilot project as approved exceeds the authority authorized by \nCongress under VPPP.”  Feb. 19 Ltr. at 2.  The letter goes on to state, without citation to any \nstatutory or regulatory authority that would purport to authorize such a decision, that Duffy had \nchosen to  “rescind[] FHWA’s  approval of the [Program] under the [VPPP Agreement] and \nterminat[e] the Agreement.”  Id. \n \n165 U.S. DEP’T OF TRANSP., Signed DOT Order re: Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic Analysis in Department \nof  Transportation  Policies  Programs  and  Activities  (Jan.  29,  2025),  https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-\nroom/signed-dot-order-re-ensuring-reliance-upon-sound-economic-analysis-department  \n  73   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 74 of 119\n \n165.  Although the February 19 Letter claims that he chose to “terminate” the Program \non legal grounds arising from his interpretation of the VPPP, the majority of the letter is instead \nfocused on reciting Duffy’s policy disagreements with the Program.  For example, Duffy complains \nthat the Program is not “a fair deal” for “working class Americans” because it imposes an additional \nfinancial burden on drivers—while failing to acknowledge that TBTA provides a substantial \ndiscount plan on Program tolls for low-income drivers and benefits them by reducing driving time.  \nId.166  The letter also cites New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s “significant concerns” about the \nProgram and its effects on New Jersey residents, but overlooks that the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey has already largely rejected Governor Murphy’s challenges to the Program \nand that the principal New Jersey challenge was based on EO 12,898, which President Trump has \nnow withdrawn.  Id.; see supra ¶ 134. \n166.  To the extent the  February 19 Letter attempts to proffer various legal bases \npurportedly underpinning Duffy’s decision, its conclusory analysis is cursory and unfounded.  \nDuffy first claims that he is “require[d] to narrowly construe” the VPPP because it operates as an \n“exception” to 23 U.S.C. § 301 which, as noted above, generally restricts tolling on federal-aid \nhighways—a restriction to which there are many broad statutory exceptions, as described supra.  \nFeb. 19 Ltr. at 3.  Drawing on this faulty, unprecedented, and overly narrow approach to construing \nthe VPPP, Duffy then seeks to justify his decision to rescind FHWA’s approval of the Program on \ntwo grounds.   \n167.  First, he notes the Program “uses a method of tolling known as ‘cordon pricing,’” \nand claims that “FHWA has never before approved a VPPP program that uses cordon pricing.”  \n \n166 See METRO. TRANSP. AUTH., Congestion Relief Zone Toll: Discounts and Exemptions, \nhttps://www.mta.info/fares-tolls/tolls/congestion-relief-zone/discounts-exemptions (last visited Mar. 27, 2025). \n  74   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 75 of 119\n \nFeb. 19 Ltr. at 3; but see supra ¶¶ 80, 86, 90, 92 (collecting cordon pricing projects funded by \nFHWA under the VPPP).  Without any analysis of the text of the VPPP or its accompanying \nlegislative history, and without acknowledging FHWA’s long history of endorsing cordon pricing \nas a value pricing strategy and funding cordon pricing projects under the VPPP, Duffy summarily \nconcludes that “no statute contemplates cordon pricing in a situation where tolls are inescapable.”  \nFeb. 19 Ltr. at 3.   \n168.  Second, Duffy objects that “imposition of tolls under the [Program] appears to be \ndriven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) \nsystem as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  Id.  While Duffy concedes, as he must, that \n“revenue generation is a necessary outcome of any congestion pricing scheme and specifically \nallowable under the VPPP statute,” and that under the VPPP revenue used to “improv[e] the transit \nsystem may eventually affect roadway congestion,” he nonetheless concludes—again, without any \nanalysis of the statutory text—that the “VPPP does not authorize tolls that are calculated based on \nconsiderations separate from reducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.”  Id.  \n169.  The legal justifications offered by Duffy for his decision to “terminate” federal \napproval of the Program are wholly without merit.  There is no truth to the claim that the VPPP \nmust be narrowly construed because it is an “exception” to 23 U.S.C. § 301.  For one thing, the \nonly express exception to Section 301 is Section 129, which broadly sets forth a bevy of ways in \nwhich the federal government may participate in tolled highways.  See 23 U.S.C. § 301 (“Except \nas  provided  in  Section  129…”);  id.  §  129  (setting  forth  various  programs  for  government \nparticipation).  The VPPP, on the other hand, is an additional, stand-alone program that Congress \ncreated for project sponsors to consider potential “value pricing pilot programs,” in which the \nSecretary “shall solicit” participation.  VPPP, cl. 1.  And in all events, the Supreme Court has \n  75   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 76 of 119\n \nrepeatedly held that exceptions should be interpreted in the same manner as any other statute, \nexplaining that “[e]xceptions and exemptions are no less part of Congress’s work than its rules and \nstandards” and courts “have no right to place our thumbs on one side of the scale or the other.”  \nBP p.l.c. v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, 141 S. Ct. 1532, 1538-39 (2021) (rejecting \nargument that Court must construe exceptions narrowly and explaining that courts have “no license \nto give statutory exemptions anything but a fair reading”); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 359 (2012) (rejecting the “false notion” \nthat “tax exemptions—or any other exemptions for this matter—should be strictly construed”).   \n170.  Duffy’s claim that the VPPP does not permit congestion pricing projects that \nemploy cordon pricing finds no support in the VPPP, which does not purport to limit the type of \n“congestion pricing pilot programs,” later renamed “value pricing pilot programs,” that States may \nimplement.  VPPP, cl. 1.  The legislative history establishes that, in enacting ISTEA, Congress \nanticipated that States could implement cordon-based tolling, see supra ¶¶ 70-74, and FHWA \ninformed Congress in testimony, shortly after ISTEA was enacted, that FHWA interpreted the \nstatute to authorize a wide range of congestion pricing strategies, “ranging from pricing on a new \nor existing single road facility to more comprehensive area-wide road pricing strategies,” supra \n¶ 75 (emphasis added).  In the years since 1991 when ISTEA was enacted, FHWA has repeatedly \nstated that the VPPP permits cordon pricing in official agency publications, notices in the Federal \nRegister, guidance documents, reports to Congress, and other materials.  See supra ¶¶ 75, 77-79, \n82, 87-89, 91, 96.  To this day, FHWA’s website includes “Cordon Tolls” among the list of \npermissible “Project Types/Projects” available to States through the VPPP.  Supra ¶ 96.  Consistent \nwith this understanding, FHWA has many times endorsed cordon pricing and awarded funds to \nproject sponsors under the VPPP to study cordon pricing projects.  See supra ¶ 84, 86-98.  And \n  76   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 77 of 119\n \nFHWA has repeatedly concluded that the VPPP authorized cordon pricing in New York City, \nwhen FHWA, during President Trump’s first term, informed the Project Sponsors that the VPPP \nwas the “best fit” for the Program, and more recently when FHWA executed the VPPP Agreement \nauthorizing tolling under the Program.  Supra ¶¶ 9.  Congress has long been aware of FHWA’s \ninterpretation of the VPPP as permitting cordon pricing, based on FHWA’s congressional reports \nand testimony, and has never sought to amend the VPPP to prohibit cordon pricing projects despite \namending other portions of the VPPP over the years.  See supra ¶ 85. \n171.  Duffy’s position that cordon tolling can only be authorized under a  separate \nstatutory provision, 23 U.S.C. § 129(d), authorizing FHWA to approve congestion pricing on \nInterstate system roads, and only in situations where “drivers can choose a non-Interstate route,” \nFeb. 19 Ltr. at 3, is nonsensical.  The entire point of cordon-based tolling, as reflected in the \nlongstanding understanding in the Congressional record and FHWA statements, is to eliminate \ntoll-free routes as the best means of alleviating congestion within a specific geographic area, \nespecially an urban area.  See supra at ¶¶ 84-85, 89.  And indeed, FHWA has funded studies of \ntrue cordon toll policies under the VPPP, and another such program is still under review for VPPP \ntolling authorization.  See supra at ¶¶ 86, 90, 92, 95. \n172.  Duffy’s letter is also factually incorrect in claiming that “the imposition of tolls \nunder the CBDTP pilot project appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the \nMetropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) system as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  \nFeb. 19 Ltr. at 3.  As explained supra, revenue generation to support public transit as a non-driving \noption has always been a complementary objective, and of no greater importance than the primary \ngoal of reducing congestion in the CBD, which transit improvements funded through toll revenues \n  77   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 78 of 119\n \nwill also support.  This aspect of Duffy’s “reasoning” simply ignores the record before FHWA \nsupporting its execution of the VPPP in 2024.  \n173.  Equally spurious is Duffy’s claim that project sponsors may not consider revenue \nobjectives when setting toll rates under VPPP-authorized tolling programs.  The VPPP contains \nno such prohibition and, to the contrary, expressly contemplates that project sponsors will use toll \n“[r]evenues generated by any pilot project” to fund other “projects eligible under such title”—\nwhich include capital transit projects eligible for federal assistance.  VPPP, cl. 3.  The statute also \nprovides that the Secretary must periodically report on the effects of VPPP projects, on not only \ncongestion but also on “transit ridership … and availability of funds for transportation programs.”  \nId. cl. 5.  As Congress noted at the time, the purpose of the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program was, \namong other things, to study the effects of such programs on “the availability of funds for \ntransportation programs.”  S. Rep. No. 102-71, 26 (1991).  Indeed, far from prohibiting project \nsponsors from considering revenue, a different section of ISTEA required project sponsors to \nconsider “the use of innovative mechanisms for financing [transportation] projects, including … \ncongestion pricing.”  ISTEA § 1025(a).  As detailed above, FHWA has repeatedly stated in official \nreports and guidance documents that revenues from congestion pricing “can be used to pay for \nexpansion of roadway facilities or to support alternatives to driving alone, such as public transit.”  \nSupra ¶ 88; see also supra ¶¶ 89, 91, 93, 96-98.  And FHWA’s website reinforces this position, \nstating that “DOT believes that using innovating financing strategies to leverage limited public \ntransportation revenue is integral to the long-term re-thinking of how the United States provides \nhighway and transit infrastructure,” one such strategy being congestion pricing.  Supra ¶ 97. \n174.  In  the  weeks  since  issuing  the  February  19  Letter,  Duffy  has  made  several \nstatements in the press that misstate easily verifiable aspects of the Program, suggesting that he \n  78   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 79 of 119\n \nmay have reached his decision, reversing longstanding FHWA legal interpretation and policy, \nwithout considering relevant information.  \n175.  On February 19, 2025, after issuing the February 19 Letter, Duffy gave an interview \nwith CBS Evening News in which he incorrectly stated that Governor Hochul “never did a study \nto say, ‘I really care about congestion and I want to reduce congestion, so I’m going to look at how \nmuch money should I charge in a toll and how much will that reduce Congestion?’ That analysis \nwas never done.”167  In fact, the Project Sponsors prepared, and FHWA approved, detailed \nanalyses of the impact of different potential toll rate schedules ranging “from approximately $9 to \n$23 during peak hours and $5 to $12 during off-peak hours” on VMT and traffic congestion in the \nCBD in connection with the FHWA’s NEPA analysis.  Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 750 F. \nSupp.  3d  171,  224  (S.D.N.Y.  2024)  (Liman,  J.);  see  also  Reevaluation  2  at  8, \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/158191.    That  analysis  considered  whether  various  tolling \nscenarios could achieve objectives to reduce VMT within and the number of vehicles entering the \nCBD by 5% and 10%, respectively.  The same analysis was conducted in the Reevaluations to \nensure that the ultimately approved tolling structure would achieve these congestion-reduction \nobjectives foundational to the purpose of the Program as articulated in the Final EA. \n176.  On March 4, 2025, in an interview with Fox News, Duffy again falsely claimed that \nthere had been no analysis of the effect of the Program toll schedule on congestion, stating: “if we \ncharge this much money … this much less congestion.  That study was never done.  This is just \nabout raising money for public transportation, and that’s why we are fighting it.”  As noted above, \nthe Project Sponsors prepared, and FHWA approved, exactly such a study. \n \n167 Matt Troutman, Trump’s Transportation Secretary 100% Open to Some Form of NYC Congestion Pricing After \nPresident Declared Tolls ‘Dead’, NY POST (Feb. 21, 2025), https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/us-news/trumps-\ntransportation-secretary-floats-some-form-of-nyc-congestion-pricing/. \n  79   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 80 of 119\n \n177.  On March 31, 2025, Duffy posted on X: “Taxpayers already paid for New York \nCity’s Roads, but NY wants to charge them AGAIN to use them.  $9 in, $9 out, with no free \nalternative.”  Again, this statement reflects Duffy’s apparent lack of understanding as to basic \naspects of the Program.  The Program only charges vehicles upon entry into the CBD and there is \nno second charge for exiting the CBD.  Under the Program’s toll rate schedule, passenger vehicles \ncan only be charged a maximum of once per day for entry into the CBD.  See Phase-In Approach \nToll Rate Schedule, https://www.mta.info/document/138931.  \nFigure 12: Mar. 31, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n178.  That same day, February 19, 2025, Duffy released a press statement announcing \nthat FHWA had “terminated approval of the pilot for New York’s Central Business District Tolling \nProgram,” in which he described the Program as a “slap in the face to working class Americans \n  80   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 81 of 119\n \nand small business owners,” and “backwards and unfair.”168  However, the same analysis that was \nundertaken by the Project Sponsors and approved by FHWA looked at the projected economic \nimpact of the Program and considered whether residents or businesses would be forced to move \nor whether there would be changes in economic conditions leading to a loss or substantial \ndiminishment of products and services.  Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *6.  Their analysis concluded \nthat the Program “would provide an economic benefit” to the CBD and “would not be likely to \nresult in the involuntary displacement of residents, business, or employees.” Id. at *7.  And as \nnoted above, the Program has actually already had a positive impact on business. \nI.

When the Administration finally attempted to “terminate” the Program on February \n19, 2025, after repeatedly threatening to do so in the press, Plaintiffs immediately commenced the \ninstant lawsuit.  In their original complaint, filed that same day, Plaintiffs alleged that the February \n19 Letter was legally invalid and unenforceable and sought a declaratory judgment that the VPPP \nAgreement remained in effect.  In light of the rights granted to TBTA by the VPPP Agreement, \nthe irreparable harm that ending the Program would cause for the MTA, TBTA, and the people of \nNew York, and the clear deficiencies in the February 19 Letter’s rationales, Plaintiffs stated that \nthey would “continue to operate the Program as required by New York law until and unless \nPlaintiffs are directed to stop by a court order.”  ECF 1, ¶¶ 25, 120. \n \n168 Press Release, U.S. DEP’T OF TRANSP., U.S. Department of Transportation Terminates Tolling Approval for New \nYork City’s Cordon Pricing Program (Feb. 19, 2025), https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/us-department-\ntransportation-terminates-tolling-approval-new-york-citys-cordon-pricing. \n  81   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 82 of 119\n \n180.

Almost immediately upon release of the February 19 Letter, legal scholars and \npublic commentators questioned its validity and noted that it was unlikely to be enforced by the \ncourts.  David A. Super, a professor at Georgetown Law, told the New York Times that Duffy did \nnot have authority to rescind federal approval of the Program, explaining: “There is really nothing \nin the statute that gives the secretary authority to stop these things.”169  Robert L. Glicksman, a \nprofessor  at  George  Washington  University  Law  School,  likewise  questioned  Defendants’ \nauthority, noting that simply “[d]eclaring ‘I’m the king’ is not sufficient grounds for reversing \n[federal approval of the Program].”170  Noah Kazis, an assistant professor at the University of \nMichigan Law School, called the Administration’s move a “political wrecking ball” that disregards \nthe law.171  Even supporters of the Administration’s efforts to end the Program questioned the \nreasoning of the February 19 Letter, noting that it appeared to be “based on sloppy analysis and \nstatutory triangulation.”172 \n184.  Faced with these obstacles, the Administration resorted to what has become its \nmodus operandi: attempting to improperly leverage federal funding as a way to compel compliance \nwith its unlawful decrees.  On March 18, 2025, Duffy sent a letter to the MTA (“March 18 Safety \nLetter”), Exhibit D, demanding detailed information on crime and safety in subways and on buses \nin New York City, and threatening “further consequences, up to and including redirecting or \nwithholding funding.”  Although the letter did not directly reference the Program, it was widely \n \n169 Tracey Tully, Why Trump’s Push to Kill Congestion Pricing Might Fail, N.Y.

Significantly, Duffy’s March 18 demand for information differed materially from \na similar letter to the  D.C. Metro system, Washington Metropolitan Area  Transit Authority \n(“WMATA”),  on  March  6,  2025.    While  the WMATA  letter  also  requested  subway  safety \ninformation, it did not include the same threat of redirecting or withholding federal funding as in \nthe letter to the MTA.  In his letter to the Chief Executive Officer of WMATA, Duffy similarly \nrequested WMATA’s plans to reduce crime and fare evasion and information about WMATA’s \nbudget,  but  stated  only  that  WMATA  “should  target  federal  resources  expeditiously  and \nappropriately for” eligible federal crime prevention and security activities.   \n186.  On March 19, 2025, WMATA responded to Duffy with their crime statistics and \ntheir planned budget increases for additional safety-related investments.

Duffy’s March 18 demand for information also differed materially from a letter he \nsent to Stephen J. Gardner, the Chief Executive Officer of Amtrak on March 6, 2025.  While the \nAmtrak letter also emphasized the importance of addressing security and preventing crime at \nWashington Union Station, the letter did not request a response or levy any threats.  Instead in his \nletter, Duffy simply stated that “[i]n the short term, Amtrak must work closely with [Union Station \nRedevelopment Corporation] to prioritize station projects that benefit all station users, including \nsecurity, lighting, and other immediate improvements that support maintenance and beautification \nof the station,” and in “[i]n the longer term, Amtrak must continue to coordinate with [Union \nStation Redevelopment Corporation], the Project sponsor for the Station Expansion Project.”  \nThus, only the letter addressed to the MTA contained the threat that federal funding may be \nwithheld.  \n188.  On March 20, 2025, the day before the deadline Defendants had set for the Program \nto cease tolling, Duffy posted to X, without prior notice to Plaintiffs, an apparent warning that \nDefendants will illegally withhold federal funding from the State of New York (and, by implication, \n  86   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 87 of 119\n \nfrom the MTA, TBTA, and NYSDOT), just as the Trump Administration has done recently in \ncountless other recent cases, unless Plaintiffs agree to end the Program.  Disregarding the fact that \nthe validity of the February 19 Letter is the subject of litigation before this Court, Duffy warned: \n“the federal government and @POTUS are putting New York on notice” that “refusal to end cordon \npricing and your open disrespect towards the federal government is unacceptable.”  Expressly \ndrawing the connection between the current litigation and federal funding, he continued: “Know \nthat the billions of dollars the federal government sends to New York are not a blank check.  \nContinued noncompliance will not be taken lightly.”  Finally, Duffy purported to grant Plaintiffs a \n“30-day extension” to cease tolling.   \n \nFigure 2: Mar. 20, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n189.  On March 20, 2025, Defendant Shepherd sent a letter to NYSDOT, NYCDOT, and \nMTA  Bridges  and  Tunnels  [TBTA]  (the  “March  20  Shepherd  Letter”  or  “Mar.  20  Ltr.”), \nExhibit E, in which Shepherd notes her prior correspondence “providing you until March 21, \n  87   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 88 of 119\n \n2025, to cease tolling operations that were initiated through the November 21, 2024, Value Pricing \nPilot Program (VPPP) Agreement,” states that Duffy “has directed that I extend the period of time \nto comply by 30 days,” and instructs that “toll operations must cease by April 20, 2025.”  Mar. 20 \nLtr. \n190.  On March 23, 2025, Duffy gave an interview with Governor Murphy, in which \nDuffy described the New York subways system using an expletive, stating: “If you want people to \ntake the train, to take transit, then make it safe, make it clean, make it beautiful, make it wonderful, \ndon’t make it a s--- h---, which is what she [Governor Hochul] has done.”174   \n191.  On March 25, 2025, Duffy again took to X to threaten federal funding to the MTA \nin response to a letter from Governor Hochul, State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-\nCousins, and State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie proposing an update to the federal transit \nfunding formula, which awards the MTA only 17% of transit funding, despite its carrying 43% of \nthe nation’s mass transit riders.  Duffy described the proposal as “Outrageous!” and accused the \nState of “trying to fill the gap with highway funds and taxing the working class”—an apparent \nreference to the Program, which opponents often incorrectly refer to as a “tax”—rather than \n“actually fixing their financial mismanagement.”175  Using the same language from his March 20 \nX post demanding that New York end the Program, Duffy once again warned that “[t]he federal \ngovernment is not a blank check.” \n \n174 Larry Higgs, U.S. Transportation Boss Trashes NYC Subway, Proposes a Fix, NJ.com (Mar. 23, 2025), \nhttps://www.nj.com/news/2025/03/us-transportation-boss-trashes-nyc-subway-proposes-a-fix.html.  \n175 Indeed, if the toll were a “tax,” federal approval for tolling would not be required in the first place. \n  88   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 89 of 119\n \n \nFigure 3: Mar. 25, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n192.  On March 30, 2025 in a detailed, 22-page letter, attached hereto as Exhibit I \n(“MTA Resp.”), the MTA provided the requested information on subway crime to Duffy showing \nthat the MTA operates one of the safest transit systems in America, that crime in the NYC subway \nsystem is among the lowest it has been in the last 30 years, and that the MTA has committed more \nthan 20 times the minimum requirement in safety grant standards to keeping the system safe.  MTA \nResp. at 9-11.  The MTA’s response explained in detail that felonies in the subway system have \nfallen over the last 30 years, with a 79% decrease in robberies and a 67% decrease in grand \nlarcenies.  Id. at 10-11.  In the first two months of 2025, crime was 47% lower in the subway \nsystem than in the first two months of 2020 before COVID-19.  Id. at 10.  The MTA also \nhighlighted that felony assaults were down 7% in the first two months of 2025 compared to the \nsame time frame in 2024, but acknowledged that this was up 11% from the first two months in \n  89   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 90 of 119\n \n2020.  Id. at 2, 11.  The MTA further explained that this increase in felony assaults in recent years \nis driven by three causes: (1) “increased enforcement of fare compliance and quality-of-life \noffenses,” which is correlated with “increased [felony] assaults on NYPD officers who are \npatrolling the system in larger numbers,” id. at 11; (2) the “MTA’s ongoing and successful efforts \nover the last 20 years to amend the NYS Penal Law to classify aggressions committed against \ntransit workers as felonies,” id. at 6; and (3) enhanced public safety campaigns, which are \nassociated with “higher rates of reporting,” id. at 11.  Over just the last two years, total arrests in \nthe subway system were up 158%, significantly outpacing the increase in assaults, which were up \nby 4% from 2022 to 2024, even as the overall number of felonies continued to fall. \n193.  Despite the fact that the MTA is a safer transit system than WMATA, as WMATA \nriders are 3 times more likely than New York City transit riders to be victims of assaults on a per \ntrip basis, see id. at 2, Duffy has not issued a post, as he did in response to WMATA, to commend \nthe MTA for their commitment to safety.  Instead, the day after receiving the MTA’s response \nletter, Duffy posted to X that “[f]elony transit assaults on NYC subways are up 56% from 2019.”   \nThis comment completely misrepresented the safety information provided by the MTA and \ndisregards the MTA’s explanation that more felonies are being reported because of additional \npolicing measures and increased legal protections for subway and bus employees.  Specifically, as \nMTA explained in its response to Duffy, the increase in felony assaults is largely a result of the \npattern of increased assaults on NYPD officers as those officers have been patrolling the system \nin greater numbers and enforcing quality-of-life offenses; amendments to the New York State \nPenal Law to provide greater protections to transit workers from assault; and enhanced public \nsafety awareness campaigns.  Id. at 6, 11. \n  90   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 91 of 119\n \nFigure 15: Mar. 31, 2025 social media post to X by @SecDuffy \n194.  On April 4, 2025, Duffy invited members of the press to join him on the New York \nsubway system and attempted to draw a connection between congestion pricing and subway crime, \nnotwithstanding that subway crime is at a historic low and the two issues bear little relation.  \nSpecifically, Duffy stated: “If they’re going to charge people to drive on roads, they need to offer \na better, safer subway system.”176  He also claimed: “The governor is forcing people into the train \nsystem, into the MTA, because she’s priced them out of using these roads.  That’s fundamentally \nunfair.” \n195.  On  April  15,  2025,  Duffy  came  across  a  violent  incident  while  visiting  the \nWMATA subway system involving a police officer who had been stabbed in the face by a man \nattempting to fare evade.177  Notably, while Duffy’s statements after the event discussed the \ngeneral need to “re-secure our transit systems” and address crime, he stopped short of directly \ncriticizing the WMATA for the incident.  This treatment of the WMATA—which is less safe as a \nsystem than the MTA—stands in contrast to Duffy’s frequent and harsh criticisms of the MTA, \n \n176 Linda Schmidt, Transportation Secretary Rides NYC Subway, Calls Conditions Unsafe as Federal Funding \nHangs in the Balance, Fox 5 (Apr. 4, 2025), https://www.fox5ny.com/news/transportation-secretary-rides-nyc-\nsubway-calls-conditions-unsafe-federal-funding-hangs-balance.  \n177 Andrea Margolis, DC Transit Police Officer Stabbed at Train Station as Sec.

Defendants threaten Plaintiffs with unlawful “compliance measures” to begin on May \n28, 2025, if the Program does not cease operation  \n196.  On April 18, the MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT filed their 111-page \nconsolidated first amended complaint, setting out in detail the many reasons why the February 19 \nLetter’s legal rationales for seeking to terminate the VPPP Agreement are without merit, and \nalleging that the purported rescission is invalid and based on transparently pretextual reasoning. \n197.  Three days later, on April 21, Duffy sent the April 21 Letter, attached hereto as \nExhibit J, to Governor Hochul demanding for a third time that the Program end.   \n198.  At the outset, the April 21 Letter affirmed Defendants’ position that the VPPP \nAgreement had been “terminated” by the February 19 Letter.  Id. at 1.  Seemingly recognizing the \nweaknesses in the February 19 Letter’s legal rationales, however, Duffy attempted to recast that \nletter’s reasoning, claiming without any support that the February 19 Letter also rests on several \nnewfound policy rationales, including that the Program “imposes a disproportionate financial \nhardship on low and medium-income hardworking American drivers for the benefit of high-\nincome drivers,” and that “[h]ighway users whose taxes already paid for the Federal-aid highways \nin the cordon area are now being forced to pay again while received no new highway benefits in \nreturn because there are no toll-free alternative routes available to access the cordoned-off area of \nManhattan.”  Id. at 2-3.  The February 19 Letter does not address Defendants’ own extensive \nfindings that congestion pricing would benefit low- and medium-income drivers, including by \nfacilitating mass transit opportunities and reducing congestion on the roads.   \n199.  The April 21 Letter threatens that Defendants “will implement appropriate initial \ncompliance measures” on or after May 28, 2025 if New York continues to operate the Program, \n  92   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 93 of 119\n \nciting 23 C.F.R. § 1.36, a regulation enacted pursuant to the FAHA that sets forth FHWA’s \npotential enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the law.  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  \nThe threatened “compliance measures” include: (1) “no further advance construction (‘AC’) \nauthorizations,”  (2) “no further [NEPA] approvals,” (3) “no further approvals of Statewide \nTransportation Improvement Program (‘STIP’) amendments concerning New York Metropolitan \nTransportation Council TIP modifications,” and (4) “no further obligations of FHWA funds (both \nformula and competitive) for projects within New York City.”  The April 21 Letter then states that \n“if New York’s noncompliance continues,” FHWA may impose additional measures including “no \nfurther obligations of FHWA funds (both formula and competitive).”  \n200.  The April 21 Letter states that no funding will be withheld for projects “determined \nby  FHWA  to  be  essentially  for  safety”  including  projects  “under  the  National  Highway \nPerformance Program, Bridge Formula Program, and Highway Safety Improvement Program” but \ndoes not clarify what process Defendants will use to determine whether a project is “determined” \nto “be essential for safety.” \n201.  The threatened enforcement measures would deprive Plaintiffs of access to federal \ntransportation funds, or to initiate any new projects, shutting down investment in the nation’s \nlargest city.  And they would similarly deprive NYSDOT and NYCDOT of funding for vital \nprojects.  The incredibly broad scope of the coercive threats to halt reviews needed for all projects \nand funding within FHWA’s purview, including billions of dollars’ worth of funding for transit \nprojects currently proposed for addition to New York’s STIP, unless the Program is brought to a \nstop. \n202.  The April 21 Letter also directs Plaintiffs to “address the policy concerns expressed \nin my February 19, 2025 letter,” even though the February 19 Letter articulated only legal \n  93   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 94 of 119\n \nrationales for terminating the VPPP Agreement.  Compare Feb. 19 Ltr. at 3 with April 21 Letter \nat 2-3.   \n203.  Defendants have left no doubt that they intend to impose “compliance measures” \non May 28 if Plaintiffs do not end congestion pricing—regardless of the outcome of this lawsuit.  \nOn April 24, a spokesperson for the USDOT stated, “if New York doesn’t shut it down, the \nDepartment of Transportation is considering halting projects and funding for the [S]tate.”178   \n204.  On April 29, Duffy took to TV to criticize the Program, telling the hosts of Good \nDay New York that if Plaintiffs do not “treat those who want to come into Manhattan fairly, maybe \nwe should look at how much money we send the City.  And that’s what the Governor [of New \nYork] is going to have to grapple with.”179  That same day, counsel for Plaintiffs requested that \nDefendants agree not to take any enforcement action or postpone the April 21 Letter’s deadlines.  \nDefendants responded by reiterating the threat of coercion, while trying to deny the Court any \nability to review the legality of that threat, claiming that the termination and schedule for \n“compliance measures” remain in place but that administrative proceedings are ongoing and \npreclude judicial recourse.  ECF 73. \nK.  The MTA, TBTA, and the Region’s Economy and Public Transit System Will be \nIrreparably Harmed if Plaintiffs are Forced to End the Program  \n205.  TBTA budgeted over $500 million to establish the Program, and much of the \nbudget was expended in advance of implementation.  These expenditures included developing the \nmethodological approach; conducting the assessment and extensive outreach and developing the \nfinal documentation for the environmental review process under NEPA; design, development, \n \n178 Peter Senzamici, Feds Accidentally upload internal memo admitting plan to kill NYC congestion pricing is ’very \nunlikely’ to succeed – before quickly deleting it, N.Y.

If TBTA is unlawfully prevented from proceeding with the Program, it will incur \nroughly $12 million in additional expenditures per month, most of which would be related to a \ncombination of the operations and maintenance of the roadside tolling system, the operations of \nthe back-office system and Customer Contact Center, and consultant costs.  This figure does not \ninclude the costs related to additional staff that were brought on specifically for the Program nor \nother costs, such as those related to outreach and advertising and assessments to be undertaken for \nthe Program.  These costs cannot be deferred pending litigation over the legality of the February \n19 Letter. \n207.  Any pause in the Program would also cause TBTA to lose estimated monthly \nrevenues in the first phase of the Program of over $40 million, based on projected net annual \nrevenues of roughly $500 million during that period. \n208.  Furthermore,  a  pause  in  the  Program  would  result  in  increased  traffic  and \ncongestion, which will lengthen travel times for bus operations and reduce public transit ridership. \n209.  Stopping the Program would also prevent the MTA, the end recipient of Program \nrevenues, from proceeding with vitally important work under the Capital Program, which is \nintended to ensure that improvements put in place will be sustainable for years to come.  The \nCapital Program identifies $52 billion of critical investments in the region’s subways, buses, and \ncommuter railroads, nearly one-third of which would be supported by the Program.   \n  95   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 96 of 119\n \n210.  New York’s economy, and therefore the nation’s economy, depends on keeping \nNew York moving.  In practical terms, that means funding the Capital Program, which is much \nneeded and cannot be further delayed.  As Janno Lieber, the MTA Chair and CEO, explained: \n“Concrete and steel, you poke holes in it, subject it to water and chemicals and salt for 100 years, \nit’s going to give out.”  The reason the State’s elected representatives chose Congestion Pricing \nwas, again, because it is simply the best solution to promote speed and convenience in the nation’s \n(and North America’s) largest transportation system. \n211.  Critical parts of the Capital Program would be delayed if Program tolling revenues \nare halted.  The Capital Program includes: (1) adding accessibility improvements (including \nelevators) to numerous subway stations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, by \nmaking at least 70 more subway systems accessible through building new elevators at 70 stations \nin all of the boroughs and replacing up to 65 escalators and 78 elevators, and finally bringing the \ntransportation system to greater than 50% accessibility; (2) improving outdated signaling, by \ndoubling the number of track lines with modernized signals; (3) purchasing over 1,900 new rail \ncars, which are six times more reliable than older ones, and replacing 2,400 buses; (4) replacing \napproximately 60 miles of track; and (5) renewing stations and addressing critical repair projects \nat 175 stations.  \n212.  The Capital Program will also provide much-needed repairs to Grand Central \nTerminal, a more than 100-year-old structure that is used by more than 700 trains a day.  And \ncoupled with funding from the 2015-2019 program, the Capital Program further provides funding \nfor three new fully accessible stations on the Second Avenue Subway that would allow connection \nto the Metro-North lines, strengthening connections for Harlem and East Harlem residents.  \n213.  New Yorkers, through the Capital Program, will also receive better access to Penn \n  96   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 97 of 119\n \nStation through a new route with four new stations on the Metro-North New Haven Line that will \ncarry up to 50,000 Metro-North customers directly to Penn Station every day.  \n214.  TBTA has incurred debt that it will rely on Program revenues to repay.  This \nincludes $378.8 million in short-term notes that were previously issued and currently outstanding \nto fund infrastructure costs and $500 million in short-term notes to fund a portion of the $15 billion \nof capital projects in the MTA’s Capital Program. \n215.  Finally, ending the Program means making life worse for millions of New Yorkers \nthrough a return to severe congestion in the CBD, with its concomitant economic, environmental, \nand public health and safety costs to businesses, residents, commuters, workers, and visitors in this \narea, without any evaluation of these and other environmental impacts, opportunity for public \nparticipation, or consideration of alternatives required by NEPA.   \n216.  Plaintiffs will continue to operate the Program as required by New York law unless \nand until Plaintiffs are directed to stop by a court order.   \n217.  Based on the foregoing, there is an actual controversy within the jurisdiction of this \nCourt under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION  \nCOUNT I \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Substantively Arbitrary & Capricious – In Excess of Statutory Authority) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n218.

Defendants  are  not  authorized  by  any  law—statutory  or  constitutional—to \nunilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement.  The VPPP Agreement is a valid agreement, currently \nin effect, supported by consideration, and subject to considerable reliance interests.  Neither ISTEA \nnor the VPPP Agreement authorizes FHWA to unilaterally rescind the VPPP Agreement, which \nconfers federal tolling authority under Section 1012(b) of ISTEA, as amended. \n222.  ISTEA does not include any provision authorizing FHWA to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement.  ISTEA authorizes the Secretary to “enter into” agreements “to establish, maintain, and \nmonitor” value pricing pilot programs.  ISTEA § 1012(b).  ISTEA further directs that the Secretary \nshall “monitor the effect of such programs for a period of at least 10 years.”  Id. at § 1012(b)(5). \n223.  The  VPPP  Agreement  does  not  include  any  provision  authorizing  FHWA  to \nterminate the agreement.  Rather, the VPPP Agreement contemplates that only TBTA could \nunilaterally decide to discontinue the Program, requiring the Project Sponsors to “work with FHWA \nto return the Project to its original operating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the \nProject.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 11.  The VPPP Agreement further provides that TBTA and NYCDOT \nshall “monitor and report on the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the \nend of the life of the Project, whichever is sooner.”  Id., cl.

Part 940 and 950.  \nThese regulations do not grant FHWA authority to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement, and \nthe FHWA has acted ultra vires. \n225.

Cir. 1996).  \n226.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of rights expressly and impliedly granted by \nISTEA § 1012(b), which permits tolling of federally funded highways following approval of a \nVPPP Project.  \n227.  Defendants have no authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement or rescind TBTA’s \nauthority to operate the Program.  Therefore, Defendants have acted in excess of authority and the \nFebruary 19 Letter is arbitrary and capricious and must be declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside.  \nCOUNT II \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Substantively Arbitrary & Capricious – Contrary to Law) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n228.

Further, under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n  99   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 100 of 119\n \n231.  Defendants’ purported basis to terminate the VPPP Agreement—broadly, that the \nProgram “is not an eligible ‘value pricing pilot program’” and thus “FHWA lacked statutory \nauthority to approve” the Program, Feb. 19 Ltr. at 3—finds no support in the statutory text, \nlegislative history, or FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of the VPPP, and is “not in accordance \nwith law.” \n232.  The February 19 Letter states two main rationales for Defendants’ conclusion that \nthe Program is not an eligible VPPP project.  First, without any analysis of the statutory text, \nlegislative history, or FHWA’s long history of endorsing cordon pricing as a value pricing strategy, \nDefendant Duffy summarily concludes that “no statute contemplates cordon pricing in a situation \nwhere tolls are inescapable.”  Id.  Second, again without any analysis of the actual statute or its \nhistory, Duffy objects that “imposition of tolls under the [Program] appears to be driven primarily \nby the need to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority (MTA) system as opposed \nto the need to reduce congestion.”  Id.  Both rationales are incorrect as a matter of fact and law.  \n233.  Cordon pricing projects are authorized under the VPPP.  Specifically, the VPPP \nauthorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter into cooperative agreements with State and local \ngovernments to implement “value pricing pilot programs.”  VPPP, cl. 1.  The statute does not define \n“value pricing pilot programs” or otherwise provide guidelines or restrictions on the kinds of \nprojects that are eligible under the statute.  The legislative history reflects Congress’s intent to \nauthorize a variety of innovative projects, including those that use cordon-based tolling and “area-\nwide road pricing strategies.”  And cordon-based or area-wide pricing projects have received \nfederal funding pursuant to the VPPP, not to mention the tolling authority actually approved for the \nProgram under the VPPP Agreement itself.   \n  100   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 101 of 119\n \n234.  Moreover, it is untrue that the primary driver of the Program is revenue generation.  \nThe record is clear that generation of revenue to improve public transit is complementary to the \nprimary purpose of congestion reduction. \n235.  In any event, raising revenue to fund the MTA’s Capital Program is clearly \nauthorized under the VPPP.  For one, the statutory text explicitly contemplates that State and local \ngovernments participating in VPPP projects would use toll revenues to fund other “projects eligible \nunder such title,” VPPP, cl. 3, which includes capital transit projects.  The statute also provides that \nthe Secretary must periodically report on the effects that VPPP projects have on not only congestion \nbut also “transit ridership … and availability of funds for transportation programs.”  Id., cl. 5.  \nFurthermore, the legislative history of ISTEA and the subsequent laws amending the VPPP \nconfirms that Congress intended for State and local governments to consider revenue generation \nfor mass transit projects in implementing VPPP projects and to be able to use revenues to improve \ntransit services and systems. \n236.  Defendants’ rationales for purportedly terminating the VPPP Agreement are flatly \ncontradicted by the factual record, the text of the VPPP, the legislative history of ISTEA, and \nFHWA’s subsequent statements about and efforts to implement the VPPP and value pricing \nprojects.  Therefore, Defendants have acted contrary to law and the February 19 Letter is arbitrary \nand capricious and must be declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside.  Any effort to enforce the \nFebruary 19 Letter (including by implementing the “compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 \nLetter) is arbitrary and capricious, and must be enjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nCOUNT III \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Procedurally Arbitrary & Capricious – Contrary to Regulations) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) \n  101   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 102 of 119\n \n237.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n238.  The VPPP Agreement is a cooperative agreement because “the principal purpose \nof the relationship is to transfer a thing of value” (authority to collect toll revenues) and “substantial \n[federal] involvement is expected.”  31 U.S.C. § 6305; 2 C.F.R. § 200.1; see also VPPP, cl. 1 \n(authorizing Secretary to enter into “cooperative agreements” under the VPPP).  FHWA has \ndetermined that agreements authorizing projects that require tolling authority under the VPPP are \ncooperative agreements, even where such agreements do not include a federal funding component.  \nSee FED. HIGHWAY ADMIN., Congestion Pricing, Value Pricing Pilot Program (May 17, 2024), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing (“The Moving Ahead for Progress in the \n21st Century (MAP-21) Act did not authorize additional funds after FY2012 for the discretionary \ngrant component of the Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP).  However, FHWA’s ability to enter \ninto cooperative agreements for projects that require tolling authority under this program for their \nimplementation will continue.”) (last accessed Feb. 12, 2025). \n239.  FHWA cooperative agreements are governed by the Office of Management and \nBudget’s  agency-wide  Uniform  Administrative  Requirements,  Cost  Principles,  and  Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards (“Uniform Guidance”), 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  See id. § 1201.1.  \nThe Uniform Guidance sets out specific conditions under which  a cooperative agreement, see id. \n§ 200.1, may be terminated:  \na.  by the agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms and conditions” \nof the award;  \nb.  by the agency with the “consent” of the recipient;  \nc.  by the recipient; and \n  102   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 103 of 119\n \nd.  by the agency “pursuant to the terms and conditions” of the award.   \nId. § 200.340(a).   \n \n240.  None of the conditions in which termination is permitted under the Uniform \nGuidance are present here.  First, Duffy did not and cannot claim that the recipients have failed to \ncomply with the terms of the conditions of the VPPP Agreement, and the recipients have in fact \ncomplied with the terms of the VPPP Agreement; second, the recipients did not and do not consent \nto termination of the VPPP Agreement; third, the recipients have not requested termination of the \nVPPP Agreement; and, fourth, the VPPP Agreement does not contain any provisions that would \npermit Defendants to terminate the agreement unilaterally.  Additionally, to the extent the VPPP \nAgreement contemplates termination by any party, it reflects that TBTA would be the one party \nwhich could “discontinue tolls on the Project.”  VPPP Agmt., cl. 11. \n241.  The Uniform Guidance describes specific steps that an agency must take before it \nmay terminate an award for noncompliance, including providing written notice and an opportunity \nto be heard.  2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341(a), 342.180  FHWA did not provide the recipients with notice of \nits intent to terminate the VPPP Agreement and also has not provided notice to the recipients of any \nalleged noncompliance with the VPPP Agreement.  The recipients have not been provided with an \nopportunity to be heard or to appeal the termination. \n242.  The  Administration’s  action  in  terminating  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement contrary to the terms of the VPPP Agreement and the applicable regulations governing \nthe administration of the VPPP Agreement was arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, \nand without observance of procedure required by law, within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n \n180  See  also  U.S.  DEP’T  OF  TRANSP.,  Guide  to  Financial  Assistance  at  72-77  (Oct.  2019), \nhttps://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-10/DOT_Guide_to_Financial_Assistance \n_effective_January_1_2020.pdf (further describing requirements for pre-termination notice and appeals).   \n  103   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 104 of 119\n \n§ 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by the Court.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n244.  At the time of Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, FHWA \nhad issued the Final EA, FONSI, Reevaluation 1, and Reevaluation 2, and had executed the VPPP \nAgreement authorizing tolling under the Program.   \n245.  FHWA’s execution of the VPPP Agreement constituted final agency action with \nrespect to FHWA’s decision to authorize tolling under the Program. \n246.  Under the APA, an agency “changing its course” is “obligated to supply a reasoned \nanalysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first \ninstance.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n42 (1983).  \n247.  Defendants did not adequately explain their reasoning for purportedly rescinding \nthe VPPP Agreement, in violation of the APA.  See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, \n106 (2015) (“[T]he APA requires an agency to provide more substantial justification when ‘its new \npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its \nprior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’”) (quoting \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)). \n  104   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 105 of 119\n \n248.  Defendants did not adequately examine or rely on relevant data in deciding to \nterminate the VPPP Agreement, in violation of the APA.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at \n43 (an agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \naction.”).  The rationales given for rescinding the VPPP Agreement in the February 19 Letter, and \nfor concluding that the VPPP does not authorize the Program, are incorrect, invalid, and directly \ncontrary to the position of the FHWA for the past 34 years. \n249.  Defendants failed to consider the impact on the economy, the environment, and \ncongestion in the CBD in acting to terminate the tolling authority for the Program.  The Program \nwill provide substantial benefits to the CBD and the region in terms of reduced traffic and \ncongestion, improved air quality, and concomitant environmental, public health, and economic \nbenefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that occurred following the implementation of the \nProgram.   \n250.  Defendants were obligated to consider the costs of ending the VPPP Agreement for \nPlaintiffs and for transit riders, people residing, working, learning and recreating in and around the \nCBD.  Defendants failed to do so, having made their decision without seeking input from Plaintiffs \nand without inquiring about the costs from congestion, pollution, and cessation of the Program in \nwhich TBTA has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to bring online.   \n251.  Defendants also failed to adequately  consider  whether  “there was  ‘legitimate \nreliance’ on the” FHWA’s longstanding interpretation and use of the VPPP as an indispensable tool \nin efforts to address congestion, reduce pollution, and raise revenues to support public transit.  Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020) (quoting Smiley v. \nCitibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996)).  The MTA, TBTA, and now holders of \ndebt issued in reliance on Program revenues, have all relied on the executed VPPP Agreement.  The \n  105   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 106 of 119\n \nFebruary 19 Letter was arbitrary and capricious; where, as here, “an agency changes course … it \nmust ‘be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that \nmust be taken into account.”’  Id. (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, \n2126 (2016)).   \n252.  Instead, Defendants acted entirely based on political considerations.  Defendants \nhad made no indication that they were reconsidering the Program until President Trump took office \nlast month.  But President Trump has long indicated his desire to “kill” or terminate the Program, \nboth in conversations with Republican lawmakers and in social media posts.  Defendants, bending \nunder this political pressure, did not undertake any analysis or provide any explanation before \nrevoking their prior decision to enter into the VPPP Agreement and approve the Program. \n253.  Defendants’  action  purporting  to  revoke  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement without providing sufficient explanation of their decision was therefore arbitrary, \ncapricious, and not in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, \nwithin the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by \nthe  Court.    Any  effort  to  enforce  the  February  19  Letter  (including  by  implementing  the \n“compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 Letter) is arbitrary and capricious, and must be \nenjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nCOUNT V \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(Pretext) \n(5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; U.S. Const. amend.

New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780 (2019) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 167-69 (1962)).  Here, “[s]everal points, \n  106   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 107 of 119\n \nconsidered together, reveal a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and \nthe rationale he provided.”  Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 783. \n255.  President Trump made his intention to “TERMINATE” the Program clear as a \ncandidate for office, see supra ¶ 155, and continued to reiterate his goal in statements after winning \nelection, see supra ¶¶ 156-59.  While the reasons for the President’s opposition to the Program \nhave changed over time, he never expressed concern that the Program was unauthorized by the \nVPPP. \n256.  The February 19 Letter states that Duffy, upon assuming office, was directed by \nPresident Trump to “review FHWA’s approval of the [Program]” in light of the President’s \n“concerns” about “the extent of the tolling” and “the significant burdens on the New York City \nresidents, businesses, and area commuters (including those from New Jersey and Connecticut) \nwho regularly use the highway network in the CBD tolling area.”  Feb. 19 Ltr. at 1.   \n257.  Very shortly after receiving this directive from President Trump, Duffy purported \nto announce a dramatic change in USDOT and FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of the VPPP \nin an informal opinion letter with little or no legal reasoning.  While Duffy claimed to rest his \ndecision  on  purely  legal  rationales,  the  vast  majority  of  his  letter  is  spent  reciting  policy \ndisagreements with the Program, see supra ¶ 163.  Likewise, Duffy’s public statements have made \nabundantly clear that his true motivation for purporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement is \npolitical disagreement with the Program itself. \n258.  Since then, Defendants have pressed forward with their openly political effort to \nend the Program by threatening to illegally withhold federal funding from the State of New York \n(and by implication, from Plaintiffs), and by raising clearly pretextual concerns about subway \nsafety, at a time when subway crime is at historic lows.  See supra ¶¶ 182-93.  These actions further \n  107   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 108 of 119\n \nreinforce that Defendants’ goal from the start has been to end the Program, rather than interpret \nthe text of the VPPP, and that Defendants worked backwards to attempt to conjure a legal rational \nwith which to “TERMINATE” the Program. \n259.  Duffy’s  reliance  on  questionable  legal  interpretations  to  justify  his  complete \ndisregard for Plaintiffs’ reliance interests—which would otherwise constrain the agency from \nabruptly terminating the VPPP Agreement and abandoning its long held interpretation of the \nVPPP—reinforces that Duffy’s reasoning is pretextual, and intended to shield his true decisional \nprocess from judicial review. \n260.  “Altogether, the evidence tells a story that does not match the explanation the \nSecretary gave for his decision.”  Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 784.  The Administrative Procedure \nAct  bars  such  pretextual  decision-making:  “The  reasoned  explanation  requirement  of \nadministrative law, after all, is meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for \nimportant decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.  Accepting \ncontrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.”  Id. at 785.  The February 19 Letter’s \npretextual rationales violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the APA and, in addition, violated the MTA, \nTBTA, and NYCDOT’s rights under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.  \nAny  effort  to  enforce  the  February  19  Letter  (including  by  implementing  the  “compliance \nmeasures”  outlined  in  the  April  21  Letter)  is  arbitrary  and  capricious,  not  to  mention \nunconstitutional, and must be enjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nCOUNT VI \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment  \n(U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 3) \n261.

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “No person shall … \nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend. V, cl. 3. \n263.  Upon  the  execution  of  the  VPPP  Agreement,  Plaintiffs  MTA,  TBTA,  and \nNYCDOT had a property interest in the VPPP Agreement and in the authority granted by the VPPP \nAgreement to implement tolls within the CBD for the Program.  \n264.  An agency’s withdrawal of consent for public or private entities to engage in a \ncontract implicates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Toxco Inc. \nv. Chu, 724 F. Supp. 2d 16, 27-28 (D.D.C. 2010).  Defendants’ unilateral termination of the VPPP \nAgreement deprives Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT of a property interest contrary to law. \n265.  Further, Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT’s property interest in the Program \nand its infrastructure “attain … constitutional status by virtue of the fact that they have been initially \nrecognized and protected by state law,” here, the TMA, and further recognized in the VPPP \nAgreement.  Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign Inv., 758 F.3d 296, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting \nPaul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710 (1976)).  \n266.  Unilateral termination of the VPPP Agreement does not afford Plaintiffs MTA, \nTBTA, and NYCDOT the process they are entitled to under the VPPP Agreement, the relevant \nregulations, and the United States Constitution.   Prior to terminating the VPPP Agreement, \nDefendants did not provide Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT with notice and failed to give \nPlaintiffs an opportunity to respond or be heard. \n267.  In  addition,  the  VPPP  Agreement  constitutes  an  agreement  which  cannot  be \ninvalidated without due process in accordance with its terms.   \n268.  Defendants’ actions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by \ndepriving Plaintiffs MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT without due process of their property interest in \n  109   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 110 of 119\n \nthe VPPP Agreement and the authority granted by the VPPP Agreement to implement tolls within \nthe CBD for the Program.  Any effort to enforce the February 19 Letter (including by implementing \nthe “compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 Letter) is unconstitutional, and must be \nenjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nCOUNT VII \nUltra Vires \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \n269.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.  \n270.  The acts of all executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, and in case \nan official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have jurisdiction to \ngrant relief.”  McAnnulty, 187 U.S. at 108.  \n271.  ISTEA  does  not  authorize  Defendants  to  unilaterally  rescind  a  cooperative \nagreement entered into to authorize tolling under the VPPP, nor does the VPPP Agreement itself \nempower Defendants to terminate the agreement or rescind FHWA’s approval of the Program.  \n272.  The February 19 Letter is ultra vires because it purports to unilaterally terminate \nthe VPPP Agreement and rescind TBTA’s authority to implement tolls under the VPPP for the \nProgram without statutory authority and contrary to the applicable agency regulations and the terms \nof the VPPP Agreement.  \n273.  The February 19 Letter is ultra vires because rescission of the VPPP Agreement is \nnot authorized under any provision of law.  \n274.  The February 19 Letter is ultra vires because the VPPP Agreement is a valid and \nbinding agreement and the VPPP Agreement does not permit unilateral rescission by FHWA or any \nother governmental actor. \n  110   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 111 of 119\n \n275.  In addition, an executive officer also acts ultra vires where it “deprives a contractor \nof a right expressly or impliedly granted by another statute.”  Reich, 74 F.3d at 1328.  \n276.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of rights expressly and impliedly granted by \nISTEA §1012(b), and thus acted ultra vires.  Any effort to enforce the February 19 Letter (including \nby implementing the “compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 Letter) is impermissible, and \nmust be enjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nCOUNT VIII \nTermination of the VPPP Agreement \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act \n(42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.; 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706) \n277.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n278.  At  the  time  of  Defendants’  purported  termination  of  the  VPPP  Agreement, \nDefendants had issued the Final EA, FONSI, Reevaluation 1, and Reevaluation 2, and had executed \nthe VPPP Agreement authorizing tolling under the Program.   \n279.  At the time of Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement, the \nNEPA process for the Program was complete, and there was no “major federal action” remaining \nto occur with respect to the Program.   \n280.  Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement constitutes a new final \nagency action under NEPA and the APA and a major federal action within the meaning of NEPA, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 4332(C), 4336e(10). \n281.  NEPA requires Defendants to prepare an EIS for any “major Federal action[] \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).   \n  111   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 112 of 119\n \n282.  To determine whether a “major federal action” will have a significant effect on “the \nquality of the human environment,” Defendants may prepare an EA.  42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 \nC.F.R. § 771.119.   \n283.  If an agency determines that the proposed action will not have significant effects, \naccounting for mitigation, it can issue a FONSI. 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.121.  If \nthe EA reveals that there may be significant effects, an EIS is required.   \n284.  Either level of review requires public participation opportunities and consideration \nof  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action.    E.g.,  42  U.S.C.  §  4332(C)(iii),  (F),  (H);  23  C.F.R. \n§ 771.119(b).  \n285.  Defendants failed to undertake any NEPA review of their decision to terminate the \nVPPP Agreement, much less an adequate environmental review that considered  environmental \nimpacts of the proposed action.   \n286.  Defendants did not undertake any public participation with respect to their decision \nto terminate the VPPP Agreement, in contrast to the substantial public participation opportunities \nafforded prior to the adoption of the Final EA (including a 44-day public comment period) and \nFONSI (including a 30-day public availability period).   \n287.  Under NEPA and its implementing regulations, Defendants are required to take a \nhard look at the reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental impacts of a proposed \naction and its alternatives.  42 U.S.C. § 4336; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b).   \n288.  Defendants failed to consider the full extent of the reasonably foreseeable impacts \nof seeking to terminate the Program, which will provide substantial benefits to the CBD and the \nregion  in  terms  of  reduced  traffic  and  congestion,  improved  air  quality,  and  concomitant \n  112   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 113 of 119\n \nenvironmental, public health, and economic benefits resulting from shifting traffic patterns that \noccurred following the implementation of the Program.   \n289.  Defendants failed to consider alternatives to terminating the program. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4332(C)(iii), (F), (H); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b). \n290.  Defendants failed to consider or identify measures which might mitigate adverse \nenvironmental impacts, and incorporate measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts into its \naction terminating the VPPP Agreement.  23 C.F.R. §§ 771.105(e), 771.119(b).   \n291.  Defendants’  action  in  purportedly  revoking  tolling  authority  under  the  VPPP \nAgreement without conducting the required NEPA review was therefore arbitrary, capricious, not \nin accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, within the meaning \nof the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and should be held unlawful and set aside by the Court.  Any effort \nto enforce the February 19 Letter (including by implementing the “compliance measures” outlined \nin the April 21 Letter) is arbitrary and capricious, and must be enjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, \nand set aside. \nCOUNT IX \nWithholding of Federal Funds \nViolation of the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment \n(Const. art I; amend. X) \n292.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set \nforth fully herein.   \n293.  The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that Congress—not the \nExecutive—“shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the \nDebts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States . . . .”  U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n  113   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 114 of 119\n \n294.  The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that the “powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to \nthe States respectively, or to the people.”  U.S. Const. amend. X. \n295.  Arising from these provisions, there are at least three “general” restrictions on the \nuse of the Spending Power to condition the receipt of federal funds.  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 \nU.S. 203, 207 (1987).   \n296.  First, “if Congress desires to condition the States’ receipt of federal funds, it ‘must \ndo so unambiguously . . ., enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the \nconsequences of their participation.’  Id. (citing Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981)).   \n297.  Second, conditions on federal grants may be illegitimate if they are unrelated “to \nthe federal interest in particular national projects or programs.”  Id.   \n298.  Third, “in some circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might \nbe so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.”  Id. at 211.   \n299.  Defendants, through the February 19 Letter and their subsequent efforts to enforce \nthe letter, purport to impose a “retroactive” condition on receipt of federal highway funds.  The \nMTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT did not have fair notice that implementing the Program \nwould  allow  withholding  of  further  highway  funds  or  the  imposition  of  other  “compliance \nmeasures,” including those detailed in the April 21 Letter.  \n300.  “Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power is broad,” but conditions \non funding must be “unambiguous[]” and they cannot “surprise[] participating States with post \nacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”  Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 25. Once a State has accepted \nfunds pursuant to a federal spending program, the Federal government cannot alter the conditions \n  114   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 115 of 119\n \nattached to those funds so significantly as to “accomplish[ ] a shift in kind, not merely degree.” \nNat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 583-84 (2012).   \n301.  Second, conditions must be “reasonably related to the purpose of the expenditure.” \nNew York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 172 (1992) (citing Massachusetts v. United States, 435 \nU.S. 444 (1978)). \n302.  A condition that New York cannot operate the Program addresses a local issue \nunrelated to the general provision of Federal highway funds.  \n303.  Finally, “conditions [on receipt of funds]” that “take the form of threats to terminate \nother significant independent grants” are properly “viewed as a means of pressuring the States to \naccept policy changes.”  Sebelius, 567 U.S. at 580. \n304.  The April 21 Letter threatens to withhold approval or otherwise restrict the MTA, \nTBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT’s ability to obtain federal funding that they would otherwise have \naccess to.  \n305.  By requiring that MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT rescind the Program and \nnullify the TMA under threat of removing or significantly curtailing their long-held interests in \nreceipt  of  federal  highway  funds  and  to  seek  approvals  for  new  projects,  Defendants  are \ncommandeering Plaintiffs and their employees as agents of the federal government's regulatory \nscheme at the agencies’ own cost.  The order interferes in New York State’s sovereignty in violation \nof the Tenth Amendment and the constitutional principles of federalism on which this Nation was \nfounded.   \n306.  As in Sebelius, here a directive that the “the Secretary . . . may declare that ‘further \npayments will not be made to the State’” unless the TMA is invalidated and the Program ceased, \nconstitutes “a gun to the head.”  Id. at 581.  \n  115   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 116 of 119\n307. The April 21 Letter purports to alter the terms upon which federal monies were\ncommitted and disbursed contrary to law.  These alterations are coercive, retroactive, ambiguous, \nand unrelated to the purpose of the myriad grants affected. \n308. The remedy these constitutional violations is “to preclude the Federal Government\nfrom imposing such a sanction.”  Id. at 588.  The Court should enjoin and set aside the February 19 \nLetter as unconstitutional and contrary to law.  Any effort to enforce the February 19 Letter \n(including by implementing the “compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 Letter) is arbitrary \nand capricious, and must be enjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nCOUNT X \nWithholding of Federal Funds \nViolation of the Separation of Powers – Usurping the Legislative Function \n(42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.; 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706) \n309. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as if set\nforth fully herein.  \n310. The Constitution “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.”\nCity & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see U.S. Const. art. \nI, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause). \n311. Congress also possesses the exclusive power to legislate.  Article I, Section 1 of the\nConstitution states that: “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.”  U.S. Const. art. I, \n§ 1; see also Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (“There is no provision in the\nConstitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”). \n312. Consistent  with  these  principles,  the  Executive  acts  at  the  lowest  ebb  of  its\nconstitutional authority and power when the President acts contrary to the will of Congress by \n116 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 117 of 119\n \nattempting to unilaterally decline to spend appropriated funds.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. \nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n313.  The April 21 Letter violates the separation of powers because the executive branch \npurports to override the careful judgments of Congress by among other things disregarding relevant \nstatutory provisions and refusing to disburse funding for innumerable federal grant programs.   \n314.  The Court should enjoin and set aside the February 19 Letter as unconstitutional \nand contrary to law.  Any effort to enforce the February 19 Letter (including by implementing the \n“compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 Letter) is arbitrary and capricious, and must be \nenjoined, declared unlawful, vacated, and set aside. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:  \ni.  Declare that Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement \nand rescission of tolling authority under the VPPP was undertaken in \nviolation of the terms of the VPPP Agreement and in excess of statutory \nauthority;  arbitrary  and  capricious  in  violation  of  the  APA;  without \nobservance of procedure required by law and regulation in violation of the \nAPA; based on a pretextual rational in violation of the APA; in violation of \nPlaintiffs the MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT’s Fifth Amendment right to Due \nProcess; ultra vires; and in violation of NEPA; \nii.  Declare the February 19 Letter, the February 20 Shepherd Letter, and the \nMarch 20 Shepherd Letter null, void, and of no effect, and vacate each \nletter; \niii.  Declare that any effort to enforce the February 19 Letter, including but not \nlimited to the “compliance measures” detailed in the April 21 Letter, are \nunlawful, and are null, void, and of no effect, and vacate any such effort; \niv.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, postpone the effective date of the March 20 \nShepherd Letter, the April 21 Letter, and any other agency action purporting \nto enforce or implement the February 19 Letter, so as to preserve the status \nquo and the rights of Plaintiffs; \nv.  Grant any further necessary and proper relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202; \nvi.  Enjoin Defendants from enforcing the February 19 Letter, the February 20 \n  117   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 96     Filed 05/06/25     Page 118 of 119\nShepherd Letter, the March 20 Shepherd Letter, the April 21 Letter, from \ntaking any further agency actions founded on those documents, or from \nwithdrawing,  cancelling,  delaying,  rescinding,  or  withholding  any \nappropriated,  authorized,  obligated,  committed,  and/or  otherwise  due \nfederal funding from Plaintiffs in retaliation for commencing this action or \nfor continuing to operate the Program; \nvii. Enjoin Defendants from withdrawing, cancelling, delaying, rescinding, or\nwithholding any appropriated, authorized, obligated, committed, and/or\notherwise  due  federal  funding  from  Plaintiffs  in  the  absence  of\nconstitutional and statutory authority and in compliance with applicable law\nand procedure;\nviii.

The Program is a long-sought-after effort to reduce traffic congestion in the \nNew York City metropolitan area by implementing a market-based, user-pay solution that charges \ndrivers a toll to enter the CBD (Manhattan at and below 60th Street), and then uses the revenue \nfrom  those  tolls  to  improve  and  expand  the  region’s  aging  public  transportation  system, \nparticularly the NYC subway.  This method of tolling, also known as “congestion pricing,” has \nbeen  successful  in  big  cities  around  the  world  including  London,  Milan,  Singapore,  and \nStockholm, and was first conceived of here in New York City at Columbia University in the 1950s \nas a solution to what even then was perceived to be the region’s significant congestion woes.  As \nof today, only four months into the Program, the available data, not to mention simply looking at \nthe streets, show that the Program is working: traffic in the CBD has dropped, commute times have \nfallen, vehicle speeds (including for public buses) have increased, more people are visiting \nManhattan’s commercial districts and supporting the region’s businesses, and the MTA’s regional \npublic transit system is seeing increased ridership and benefiting from increased funding.  \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 15 of 80\nDespite the Program’s success, the President continues to oppose it, consistent with his \nposition  since  he  began  running  for  his  second  term  last  year,  when  he  promised  to \n“TERMINATE” and “kill” the Program if elected.  The President is entitled to his personal and \npolitical view on whether congestion pricing is or is not good policy.  But he has no authority to \nstop the Program now.  In fact, during the first Trump Administration, Defendants advised TBTA, \nNew York State Department of Transportation (“NYSDOT”), and NYCDOT (collectively, the \n“Project Sponsors”) to seek federal authorization for the Program under the VPPP, 23 U.S.C. § 149 \nnote, and the federal government and the Project Sponsors proceeded to do precisely that, \nanalyzing the Program’s environmental impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 4321 et seq. (“NEPA”), for more than four years in a process that yielded thousands of \npages of environmental assessment.   \nDefendant  Federal  Highway  Administration  (“FHWA”)  (through  Defendant  Gloria \nShepherd) and the Project Sponsors then executed a binding agreement on November 21, 2024 \nauthorizing the Program under the VPPP (the “VPPP Agreement”).  The VPPP Agreement \ncontemplates that congestion pricing will continue unless and until TBTA alone decides to stop it, \nand  says  nothing  whatsoever  to  even  suggest  that  the  federal  government  (which  has  not \ncontributed and is not contributing any funds to the Program) has the power to unilaterally \nterminate it—let alone do so just months after the VPPP Agreement was executed and the Program \nbegan.  The absence of such a right on the part of Defendants is consistent with the VPPP statute, \nwhich envisions that the Program will continue for at least ten years, with regular updates being \nprovided to the federal government on its impact on congestion, transit ridership, and transit \nfunding.  It is also consistent with the fact that a central component of the Program, as everyone \nhas long known, is to use the tolling revenue (now projected between $500 million and $900 \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 16 of 80\nmillion a year) to raise $15 billion for the MTA Capital Program through bonds with terms running \nat least 30 years out from the commencement of tolling.  Obviously, none of that would make any \nsense  if  Defendants  could  simply  terminate  the  Program  at  any  time.    Indeed,  Defendants \nthemselves have recognized that agreements like the one here “must clearly and unambiguously \nspecify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.”  2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(b).  The VPPP Agreement’s silence is dispositive. \nNonetheless, shortly after taking office this year, President Trump decided to make good \non his 2024 campaign promises, declaring on social media that “CONGESTION PRICING IS \nDEAD.  … LONG LIVE THE KING!”  Simultaneously, on February 19, 2025, Defendant Sean \nDuffy issued a four-page letter purporting to “terminate” the VPPP Agreement.  Duffy claimed to \nhave determined—without any statutory basis or analysis, and contrary to decades of FHWA \npublic statements (including to Congress), approvals, and guidance—that the VPPP does not \npermit FHWA to authorize congestion pricing programs covering all the roads in a geographic \narea (known as “cordon,” “zone-based,” or “area-wide” pricing).  Duffy also claimed to have \ndetermined that the VPPP does not authorize a program that “appears to be driven primarily by the \nneed to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority.”  But these rationales are so \nweak as to be transparently pretextual.  The VPPP plainly covers tolling programs like the one \nhere, since Congress understood congestion pricing to encompass cordon pricing when it passed \nthe VPPP in 1991 and when it reauthorized the VPPP several times over the last 30 years.  \nLikewise,  the statutory text authorizes the use of tolling revenue to fund transit programs.  \nCongress (and FHWA) have long understood that the VPPP allows tolling programs that have a \nrevenue objective; tolling, by definition, raises revenue.  Using tolls to promote public transit as \nan alternative to driving, as the Program does, obviously reduces traffic congestion.  What’s more, \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 17 of 80\nDuffy did not cite any provision of law entitling him to terminate the VPPP Agreement, because \nthere is none. \nGiven the patently unlawful nature of the purported rescission, the MTA and TBTA did \nnot agree to stop congestion pricing as directed by Duffy.  Instead, they immediately commenced \nthis lawsuit seeking a declaration that Duffy’s action is invalid.  ECF 1.  With no serious defense \non the merits, the Administration has now resorted to what seems to be its modus operandi: \nattempting to improperly leverage federal funding in order to coerce compliance with its wishes, \nrather than defend the legality of its propositions in court.1  After making several proclamations \nthat congestion pricing must end, Defendant Duffy wrote to Governor Hochul on April 21 \nreiterating that the VPPP Agreement had been terminated, but “direct[ing] New York to show \ncause” by May 21 that it was in compliance with the Federal-Aid Highway Act, 23 U.S.C. § 101 \net seq. (“FAHA”), and warning that if Defendants determine congestion pricing is not permitted \nunder the VPPP (as they already have) and congestion pricing continues (as Plaintiffs have said it \nwill absent a court order to the contrary), FHWA “will implement”  “compliance measures \nbeginning on or after May 28.”  The sweeping sanctions outlined in the letter include withholding \nFHWA  funds  authorized  by  Congress  under  the  FAHA,  as  well  as  withholding  advance \nconstruction authorizations and NEPA approvals (other than undefined “Safety Projects”)—which \nmeans that myriad future projects depending on federal approvals, and ultimately federal funding, \ncould not proceed.  The sanctions also include withholding approval of amendments to the \nStatewide Transportation Improvement Program, which would preclude funding for highway and \ntransit projects throughout the State.  Any or all of these would have immediate and harmful \n \n1  Alex  Lemonides  et  al.,  Tracking  the  Lawsuits  Against  Trump’s  Agenda,  N.Y.

The threatened measures will undeniably cause irreparable harm.  That is \nthe point: Defendants acknowledge that they seek to coerce compliance with their lawless demands \nby threatening the funding of other public projects.  The loss of federal approvals and funding will \nundermine the MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT’s ability to maintain an efficient transportation system \non behalf of the millions of people who rely on that system each day.  On the other hand, \ncapitulating to Defendants’ demands would be just as devastating: the MTA would lose $50 \nmillion or more in monthly revenues, a dedicated source of public transit funding to support the \nbonding of much higher amounts, which loss could never be recovered.  The MTA would also be \ndeprived of funds to make much-needed improvements to the subway system.  And the public \nwould once again suffer the negative environmental and economic impacts that the Program is \nintended to reduce.  As this Court recognized in rejecting efforts to enjoin the Program before it \nstarted, stopping congestion pricing “would delay the environmental and economic benefits the \nTolling Program was designed to convey and force the TBTA to bear a sizeable financial burden.”  \nChan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 2024 WL 5199945, at *48 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024) (Liman, J.).  \nUnder our legal system, the Administration cannot set aside the longstanding and well-\nreasoned determinations of Congress and the Executive agencies, nor displace the Judiciary from \nits role in construing the law, by trying to strong-arm compliance.  And Plaintiffs and NYCDOT \nshould not be put to the Hobson’s choice of acceding to unlawful demands to shut down one vital \nprogram in order to avoid losing funding for so many others.  See Credit Suisse Sec. (USA) LLC \nv. Ebling, 2006 WL 3457693, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 27, 2006) (preliminary injunction warranted \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 19 of 80\nwhere harm movant seeks to redress would occur before ultimate resolution and thus movant \nwould “lose its right to meaningfully resolve” its claims).  The Court should enjoin Defendants \nfrom engaging in such unlawful retribution and preserve the status quo while this litigation \nproceeds so that the legality of Defendants’ actions can be decided in an orderly manner. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Traffic Mobility Act and FHWA’s representations \nTraffic congestion has long stymied economic growth, harmed the environment and public \nhealth, and undermined quality of life in the New York City metropolitan region.  In 2019, after \ndecades of discussion about solutions, New York passed the Traffic Mobility Act (the “TMA”), \nN.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 1701 et seq., which authorizes TBTA to establish and implement a plan \nfor tolling all eligible vehicles entering the Manhattan CBD, and requires that the tolling “ensure[s] \nannual revenues and fees collected under such program, less costs of operation of the same, provide \nfor sufficient revenues ... to fund fifteen billion dollars for capital projects for the 2020 to 2024 \nMTA capital program, and any additional revenues above that amount to be available for any \nsuccessor programs,” Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 750 F. Supp. 3d 171, 187, 191 (S.D.N.Y. \n2024) (Liman, J.).   \nBecause the Program would apply to certain federal-aid highways within the area to be \ntolled, the Project Sponsors (as noted, TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT) engaged with FHWA \nand the United States Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) to discuss how best to implement \nsuch tolling in a manner consistent with the FAHA.  From the outset, the Project Sponsors \nexplained in meetings with FHWA that the Program’s tolls would apply to all eligible vehicles \nentering the CBD, and that the Program would incorporate toll rates that would provide a new and \nrecurring revenue source for the MTA.  Declaration of Dr. Allison L. C. de Cerreño (“C. de \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 20 of 80\nCerreño Decl.”) ¶¶ 5-12.  In response, FHWA and USDOT advised the Project Sponsors that the \nVPPP was the appropriate vehicle for them to use to obtain such tolling authority.  Id. ¶¶ 6, 10.   \nAnd so, on June 17, 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted an Expression of Interest (“EoI”) \nseeking authorization under the VPPP to charge vehicles a “toll to enter or remain within the \nManhattan CBD,” with the goals (first) of “reduc[ing] traffic congestion,” and, among other things, \n“[c]reat[ing] a sustainable funding source to repair and revitalize the MTA transit system” and \n“[i]ncreas[ing] transit ridership.”  C. de Cerreño Decl., Ex. B at 3-4.  The EoI did not contemplate \nan end date for the Program and stated that the Project Sponsors would prepare reports on “the \neffects of the program” once “every two years … for the life of the program.”  Id. at 6.  On October \n24, 2019, FHWA reiterated that the VPPP “appear[ed] to be the best potential fit” among the \nvarious programs available under federal law that allow for tolling on federal-aid highways.  C. de \nCerreño Decl., Ex. C at 1. \nB.  New York’s statutory right to federal funds \nThe FAHA was enacted “to accelerate the construction of Federal-aid highway systems,” \n23 U.S.C. § 101(b)(1), and to that end requires the apportionment of funds from the Highway Trust \nFund, which consists of taxes paid by each State’s highway users, to be appropriated by the \nSecretary to the States for federal-aid highways.  Specifically, the Secretary “shall distribute” a \n“base apportionment” of funding to each State based upon a specified formula for various \nprograms, 23 U.S.C. § 104(b), with each State “[g]uaranteed” an apportionment of at least 95 cents \non the dollar with respect to its tax payments into the Highway Trust Fund attributable to the \nnumber of highway users in the State, id. § 104(c)(1)(B).  Upon apportionment to the State, the \nState transportation department submits proposed projects to the Secretary for approval, and the \nSecretary “shall act on the plans, specifications, and estimates as soon as practicable,” “guided by \nSection 109,” and “enter into a formal project agreement … formalizing the conditions of the \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 21 of 80\nproject approval.”  Id. § 106(a)(1)-(2), (4).  Section 109, in turn, sets forth detailed standards to \nguide the Secretary in carrying out his duty promptly to act on proposals, including in order to \n“adequately serve the existing and planned future traffic of the highway in a manner that is \nconducive to safety, durability, and economy of maintenance.”  Id. § 109(a)(1).  In other words, \neach State—including New York—is entitled to get back nearly all of the money that its taxpayers \npaid to the federal government for these purposes, with relatively limited discretion afforded to \nthe Secretary. \nFederal  Transit  Administration  (“FTA”)  funding  is  similarly  subject  to  legislative \ndirectives.  Congress establishes the legal  authority for  FTA programs through authorizing \nlegislation, with each reauthorization amending the Federal Transit laws codified in Title 49 U.S.C. \nChapter 53.  The most recent authorization, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), \nreauthorizes surface transportation programs for Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2022 through FY 2026.  The \nIIJA authorizes up to $108 billion to support federal public transportation programs, including $91 \nbillion in “guaranteed” funding.  See 49 U.S.C. § 5338.  The largest sums of funding fall under the \nUrbanized Area Formula Grants (“UAFGs”) ($33.5 billion) (§ 5338(a)(2)(C)), the Rail Vehicle \nReplacement Program ($1.5 billion), the Capital Investment Grants (up to $23 billion, with $8 \nbillion guaranteed); and the State of Good Repair Grants ($23.1 billion) (§ 5338(a)(2)(L)).  These \namounts cover the total apportionment under the life of the IIJA, until the passage of the next \nsurface transportation reauthorization.  The total appropriations are then provided to States and \ntransit agencies under different programs within Chapter 53.2  Although each provision provides \ndifferent bases for calculating the funds to be distributed to each state, urban area, or particular \n \n2 See e.g., § 5303 (Metropolitan transportation planning); § 5307(Urbanized Area Formula Grants); § 5329 (Public \nTransportation Safety Program); § 5336 (Apportionment of appropriations for formula grants). \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 22 of 80\nproject, the allocations for Urbanized Area Formula Grants and State of Good Repair Grants are \ndetermined by a Congressionally designated formula provided in Sections 5336 and 5337. \nC.  The broad scope of congestion pricing tolling authority under the VPPP \nWhen Congress established the forerunner to today’s federal-aid highway program in 1916, \nit determined that highways eligible for federal funds under the program should generally be free \nfrom tolls.  However, that rule was immediately subject to numerous carveouts.  See, e.g., Oldfield \nAct of 1927, Pub. L. 69-773 (Mar. 3, 1927).  Indeed, the current codification of the “Freedom from \ntolls” provision in Section 301 acknowledges a broad exception in Section 129, which allows for \nprojects as wide-ranging as the construction of new toll highways, construction of new lanes and \nconversion into a toll highway, and the reconstruction of toll-free highways and conversion into \ntoll facilities.  See 23 U.S.C. §§ 301 & 129(a)(A), (F). \nOriginally called the “Congestion Pricing Pilot Program,”3 the VPPP was enacted as part \nof the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-240 (Dec. 18, 1991) \n(“ISTEA”), to grant “states ‘greater flexibility to operate toll facilities and use toll revenues for a \nvariety of transportation projects,’” Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *33 (quoting Am. Trucking \nAssn’s, Inc. v. N.Y. State Thruway Auth., 886 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir. 2018)).  In passing ISTEA, \nCongress explained that it sought to “develop a National Intermodal Transportation System” \nconsisting “of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner.”  ISTEA § 2 \n(emphasis added); see also Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) ¶ 67.4  And in signing the bill \n \n3 Congress renamed the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program the Value Pricing Pilot Program in 1998.  Pub. L. 105-178 \n§ 1216 (June 9, 1998).  FHWA has explained that “value pricing” is a synonym for congestion pricing and that the \nagency uses the terms interchangeably.  See, e.g., FHWA, Welcome to the FHWA Congestion Pricing Web Site, \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/index.htm  (last  accessed  Mar.  26,  2025)  (“Congestion  pricing—\nsometimes called value pricing—is a way of harnessing the power of the market to reduce the waste associated with \ntraffic congestion.”).  \n4 Simultaneous with today’s filing, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenors have moved for leave to file a Second Amended \nComplaint based upon Defendants’ post-April 19 actions.  ECF 79.  Defendants do not oppose the amendment, and \n \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 23 of 80\ninto law, President Bush observed that a “major element” of ISTEA was “to provide State and \nlocal  officials  unprecedented  flexibility,”  including  discretion  to  finance  transportation \nimprovements “with toll revenue” and use funds “on the improvements that [will] best meet local \nneeds, whether highway projects or public transit projects.”  Statement by President George Bush \nUpon Signing H.R. 2950, 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1865 (Dec. 18, 1991). \nThe VPPP directs that the Secretary of Transportation “shall solicit” State and local \ngovernment participation in “value pricing pilot programs,” and therefore may “enter into” \nagreements  with  project  sponsors  to  “establish,  maintain,  and  monitor  congestion  pricing \nprojects,” and “to allow the use of tolls” as “part of a pilot program under this section.”  VPPP, \ncls. 1, 4 (emphasis added).5  Again, to be clear, the VPPP permits tolls “[n]otwithstanding sections \n129 and 301,” and permits project sponsors to use “[r]evenues generated by any pilot project” to \nfund other “projects eligible under such title,” which include transit capital projects eligible for \nfederal assistance.  Id., cl. 3; see also 23 U.S.C. § 142(a)(2). \nAlthough ISTEA does not define the term “congestion pricing,” the concept was then (and \nis today) understood to include cordon pricing.  In fact, cordon pricing was the prototype of \ncongestion pricing, originating with Columbia economist William S. Vickrey, who testified before \nCongress in 1959 that congestion pricing should be “applied to the street and highway system [in \nNew York City] as a whole, and not merely to bits and pieces of it” because, if tolls were “only on \nselected facilities, such as on the bridges, tunnels, and parkways in the New York area,” it might \nonly have the unintended consequence of rerouting traffic.  SAC ¶ 55.  Indeed, when ISTEA was \n \nwhile the motion is sub judice, for the sake of convenience we refer in this memorandum to the allegations in the \nproposed Second Amended Complaint. \n5 In a separate section, ISTEA directs states to consider “the use of innovative mechanisms for financing projects, \nincluding … congestion pricing.”  ISTEA § 1025(a).   \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 24 of 80\nenacted in 1991, Singapore had already successfully operated cordon pricing for over 15 years.  \nSee id. ¶¶ 72-79 (describing legislative history).  And as FHWA explained to Congress shortly \nafter ISTEA was enacted, the agency understood that the “potential scope of congestion pricing \napplications [under the VPPP] can vary widely, ranging from pricing on a new or existing single \nroad facility to more comprehensive area-wide road pricing strategies.”  Id. ¶ 77 (emphasis \nadded).   \nIn the decades since the VPPP was enacted, during which Congress has amended the statute \nseveral times (in 1995, 1998, and 2005), id. ¶ 73,6 Congress and FHWA have continued to \nunderstand congestion pricing to include cordon pricing.  FHWA, for example, has repeatedly \nconcluded that “areawide pricing” should merit the “highest priority for Federal support” under \nthe VPPP because such programs are often the most effective at reducing congestion.  Id. ¶ 79.  \nFHWA has reiterated this interpretation in notices published to the Federal Register, id., official \nguidance documents, id. ¶ 90, and reports to Congress, id. ¶¶ 79-81.  FHWA has also authorized \nfederal funds under the VPPP for numerous cordon pricing studies, including in Fort Myers Beach, \nFlorida in 2001 and 2002, id. ¶ 82; downtown San Francisco in 2005, id. ¶ 88; downtown Los \nAngeles in 2011, id. ¶ 92; and Treasure Island in San Francisco in 2012, id. ¶ 947 \nIn fact, in 2007, FHWA agreed to award New York City $5 million in VPPP funding to \nconsider a cordon pricing scheme in which all vehicles entering Manhattan south of 86th Street \nwould be tolled.  Id. ¶ 86.  Speaking before Congress, the FHWA Administrator at the time \ndescribed cordon pricing in Manhattan as the “best idea” he had heard for managing congestion, \n \n6 Pub. L. 104-59, § 325(e) (Nov. 28, 1995); Pub. L. 105-178, § 1216(a) (June 9, 1998); Pub. L. 105-206, § 9006(b) \n(July 22, 1998); Pub. L. 109-59, § 1604(a) (Aug. 10, 2005).   \n7 In 2021, the Utah Department of Transportation submitted an Expression of Interest for a project aimed at reducing \ncongestion at Little Cottonwood Canyon, including a cordon pricing component.  SAC ¶ 97.  FHWA noted this project \nin its most recent report to Congress on the VPPP submitted in 2023.  Id. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 25 of 80\nand explained that “the beauty of this program is whatever we invest in now … this congestion \npricing will throw off about $300 million a year to finance such things as a $6 billion or $7 billion \n2nd Avenue subway, more Express Bus service, and all those things so the commuters and \neverybody else can get to work in a lot less time.”  Id. ¶ 87.  Even now, FHWA’s website continues \nto make clear that cordon pricing is a permissible use of VPPP tolling authority.  Id. ¶ 98. \nD.  The parties complete the years’ long NEPA process and FHWA and the \nProject Sponsors execute the VPPP Agreement \nIn reliance on Defendants’ representations in late 2020 to proceed under the VPPP, the \nProject  Sponsors  commenced  a  four-year  environmental  review  process  under  NEPA  that \nculminated  in  2024.    See  Mulgrew,  750  F.  Supp.  3d  at  189-95.    The  final  environmental \nauthorization, the Second “Re-Evaluation” issued by Defendants at the end of November 2024, \nrecognizes that the Program’s tolling schedule would “be implemented through a phase-in over \nsix years,” with the last toll schedule implemented beginning in 2031, Chan, No. 23 Civ. 10365, \nECF 129-5 at 8-9, and that the MTA would issue bonds to generate the $15 billion mandated under \nthe TMA based on $500 million to $900 million per year in toll revenues, id. at 15. \nOn November 21, 2024, FHWA and the Project Sponsors signed the VPPP Agreement \nauthorizing the Program’s collection of tolls from eligible vehicles entering the CBD pursuant to \nthe VPPP.  Declaration of Brandon Trice (“Trice Decl.”), Ex. 1 (“VPPP Agreement” or “VPPP \nAgmt.”).  The VPPP Agreement states that “[e]ffective on the date of this Agreement, the project \nis approved as a pilot program” under the VPPP, and TBTA is authorized to “operate the Program \nas a toll Project in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and as a value pricing project.”  \nId., cls. 1, 8.  FHWA agreed that “the imposition of tolls under this Agreement does not render \nFederal-aid highways within the State of New York generally ineligible for Federal-aid highway \nfunds where such highways are otherwise eligible under the particular funding program.”  Id., cl. 5.  \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 26 of 80\nConsistent with the statute, the VPPP Agreement states TBTA may use “toll revenues received \nfrom the operation of the Project” for, among other things, “any other projects eligible for \nassistance under title 23, United States Code.”  Id., cl. 2.; see VPPP, cl. 3.  It also includes an \nattachment describing the Program in detail and states that TBTA “will toll vehicles entering the \nCBD,” includes the approved toll rate schedule, and notes that a goal of the Program is to “generate \nrevenue for future transportation improvements.”  VPPP Agmt., Attach. A. \nThe VPPP Agreement does not include any provision authorizing FHWA to terminate the \nagreement unilaterally, as the Secretary has purported to do here.  Just the opposite: it specifies \nthat only TBTA could unilaterally decide to discontinue the Program, requiring the Project \nSponsors to “work with FHWA to return the Project to its original operating condition if TBTA \ndecides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id., cl. 11 (emphasis added).  The VPPP Agreement \nfurther provides, consistent with the VPPP, that TBTA and NYCDOT shall “monitor and report \non the project performance” for “a period of at least ten years or to the end of the life of the Project, \nwhichever is sooner.”  Id., cl. (8)(b); see VPPP, cl. 5.  And it reflects the three phases of tolling, \nwith the last increase occurring in 2031—six years from now.  VPPP Agmt., Attach. A.  \nAfter the courts rejected numerous attempts to stop the Program, congestion pricing went \ninto effect on January 5, 2025.8  Although the full benefits of the Program have yet to be realized, \nit has already proven to be a dramatic success, creating measurable improvements in travel times, \n \n8 See Chan, 2024 WL 5199945 (111-page decision denying motions for preliminary injunctions in four related cases); \nsee also Cnty. of Rockland v.

The Administration purports to “terminate” the VPPP Agreement based on \nspurious and transparently pretextual arguments \nDespite the Program’s success and its growing support, President Trump has remained a \nstubborn and vocal opponent.  Even before the Program began, in May 2024, then-candidate \nTrump posted to social media that he would “TERMINATE Congestion Pricing in my FIRST \nWEEK back in Office!!!!”  Trice Decl., Ex. 2.  In January 2025, Representative Nicole Malliotakis \nposted on X that then-candidate Trump informed her during a meeting with New York and New \nJersey Republicans that he “wants to … kill congestion pricing.”  Id., Ex. 3. \nOn February 19, President Trump followed through on trying to “kill” the Program, \ndeclaring on X that “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. …  LONG LIVE THE KING.”  Id., \nEx. 4.  To effectuate this “royal decree,” that same day, Defendant Duffy sent a letter to Governor \nHochul purporting to withdraw Defendants’ approval of the Program and rescind the VPPP \nAgreement.  Id., Ex. 5 (the “February 19 Letter” or “Feb. 19 Ltr.”).  As grounds for the purported \nrecission, Duffy asserted that the VPPP is “a limited exception” to Section 301 that must be \n“narrowly construe[d],” and that the VPPP, through “the vague phrase ‘value pricing pilot \nprogram,’” does not “authorize the unprecedented and consequential step of cordon pricing.”  Id. \nat 2-3.  Duffy further claimed that the VPPP does not authorize tolls “that are calculated based on \nconsiderations separate from reducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.”  Id. at 3.  \nThe February 19 Letter fails to acknowledge that FHWA has for many decades interpreted the \nVPPP to permit cordon pricing, and that such projects can and should have a revenue objective, \nincluding one that supports public transit projects.  See supra at Background Section C; SAC ¶ 26.  \nDuffy did not cite any statutory, regulatory, or other basis to terminate the VPPP Agreement. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 28 of 80\nF.  Plaintiffs bring suit and Defendants attempt to coerce compliance by \nthreatening to illegally withhold federal approvals and funding \nPlaintiffs commenced this action the same day the February 19 Letter was issued, seeking \na declaratory judgment that Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement is unlawful \nand without effect, and seeking vacatur of that decision.  The MTA and TBTA further stated that \ncongestion pricing would “continue … as required by New York law until and unless” a court \norders otherwise.  ECF 1 ¶ 120.   \nThe next day, February 20, Defendant Shepherd sent a letter to the Project Sponsors \ndemanding that they “cease the collection of tolls” by March 21.  Trice Decl., Ex. 6.  The day \nbefore that deadline, on March 20, Duffy posted on X that the continued operation of the Program \nexhibited “disrespect towards the federal government” and was “unacceptable.”  Id., Ex. 7.  The \nSecretary threatened to leverage federal funding to compel compliance, stating: “Know that \nbillions of dollars the federal government sends to New York are not a blank check.  Continued \nnoncompliance will not be taken lightly.”  Id.  That same day, Shepherd sent a second letter stating \nthat Duffy had directed her to “extend the period of time to comply by 30 days” and instructing \nthat tolling cease by April 20.  Id., Ex. 8.  During an April 2 meet and confer, counsel for the MTA \nand TBTA asked if Defendants intended to take any action to enforce the April 20 “deadline” set \nforth in Shepherd’s March 20 letter, so that the parties and the Court could set an orderly briefing \nschedule.  ECF 49 at 4.  Counsel for Defendants responded that they “did not have information to \nprovide.”  Id.  Notwithstanding this representation, on April 8, USDOT posted another threat on \nX, warning that the agency “will not hesitate to use every tool at our disposal in response to non-\ncompliance later this month.”  Trice Decl., Ex. 9.  \n \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 29 of 80\nG.  Defendants threaten unlawful “compliance” measures, dramatically altering \nthe status quo  \nOn April 18, the MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT filed their 111-page consolidated \nfirst amended complaint, ECF 62, setting out in detail why the February 19 Letter’s claimed legal \nrationales for seeking to terminate the VPPP Agreement are without merit, and alleging that the \npurported rescission is invalid and based on transparently pretextual reasoning. \nThree days later, on April 21, Duffy sent another letter to Governor Hochul demanding for \nthe third time that she end the Program.  Trice Decl., Ex 10 (“April 21 Letter” or “Apr. 21 Ltr.”).  \nAt the outset, the April 21 Letter affirmed Defendants’ position that the VPPP Agreement had \nalready been “terminated” by the February 19 Letter.  Id. at 1.  But in apparent recognition of the \nweaknesses in that letter, Duffy attempted to recast the federal government’s reasoning, claiming \nthat the February 19 Letter also rested on several policy rationales, including that the Program \n“imposes  a  disproportionate  financial  hardship  on  low  and  medium-income  hardworking \nAmerican drivers,” and that “there are no toll-free alternative routes available to access the \ncordoned-off area of Manhattan.”  Id. at 2-3.  While the February 19 Letter did note that \nDefendants’ review of the Program’s eligibility was prompted by their disagreement on policy \ngrounds, the February 19 Letter is clear that Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP \nAgreement rested on their legal interpretation of the VPPP.  Feb. 19 Ltr. at 3.  What’s more, \nDefendants’ alleged “policy concerns” are fatally undermined by their own extensive findings that \ncongestion pricing would benefit low- and medium-income people, including by facilitating mass \ntransit opportunities and reducing congestion on the roads, as well as the discount for frequent \nlow-income drivers to the CBD built into the Program.9 \n \n9  See  Final  EA  Chapter  6,  Economic  Conditions  at  6-47–49,  6-80–84  (Apr.  2023), \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/110831; Final EA Chapter 17, Environmental Justice at 17-62, 17-67–72 (Apr. 2023), \n \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 30 of 80\nThe April 21 Letter goes on to threaten that Defendants “will implement appropriate initial \ncompliance measures” on or after May 28, 2025 if New York continues to operate the Program, \nciting 23 C.F.R. § 1.36, a regulation enacted pursuant to the FAHA that sets forth FHWA’s \npotential enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the law.  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  \nThese “compliance measures,” according to Duffy, include the broad suspension of federal \napprovals  for  transportation  projects,  which  would  result  in  the  withholding  of  federal \ntransportation funding in many instances.  Specifically, the April 21 Letter threatens to suspend: \n(1) “further advance construction (‘AC’) authorizations,” (2) “further [NEPA] approvals,” (3) \n“further approvals of Statewide  Transportation  Improvement Program (‘STIP’) amendments \nconcerning New York Metropolitan Transportation Council TIP modifications,” and (4) “further \nobligations of FHWA funds (both formula and competitive) for projects within New York City.”  \nId.  The April 21 Letter further threatens that those measures may be extended “to other geographic \nareas within the State of New York.”  Id. \nThe STIP is “a comprehensive list of all projects or project phases in New York State \nproposed to receive Federal funding pursuant to Title 23 [(highways)] and 49 [(transit)] U.S.C. \nChapter 53,” and includes all highway, transit and non-motorized projects” requiring Federal aid \nfrom across urban and rural parts of the state. 10  NYSDOT is responsible for updating New York’s \nSTIP, which includes Transportation Improvement Programs (“TIPs”) from each of the state’s \nfourteen Metropolitan Planning Organizations (“MPOs”).11  The STIP is updated every four years, \n \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/110886 (describing “substantial benefits associated with reduced vehicle congestion \nin the Manhattan CBD” and measures designed to lessen impacts on low-income drivers).   \n10 NYSDOT, STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM SUMMARY, \nhttps://www.dot.ny.gov/programs/stip/files/2023_STIP_Narrative.pdf.   \n11 The New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (“NYMTC”) is the MPO for New York City, Long Island, and \nthe Lower Hudson Valley, including Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland counties—a region with more than 13 \nmillion residents.

Declaration of \nKevin Willens (“Willens Decl.”) ¶ 23.  FHWA and FTA, which oversees federal transit funding, \nmust jointly approve each STIP and STIP amendment submitted to them by NYSDOT, and only \nprojects in a STIP or STIP amendment approved by both FHWA and FTA “are eligible for funds \nadministered by the FHWA or the FTA.”  23 C.F.R. §§ 450.220(a), 450.222(a).  Accordingly, the \nthreat not to provide further approvals of STIP amendments encompasses all federal funding to \nthe Project Sponsors for projects not included in the STIP.   \nThe  breadth  of  harm  is  enhanced  by  the  threatened  withholding  of  any  advance \nconstruction authorizations.  Advance construction, provided for in 23 U.S.C. § 115, allows states \nto obtain federal authorization for projects on the STIP while not yet allocating federal funding to \nthe project, and to later convert the project to a Federal-aid project.12  And the withholding of \nNEPA “approvals”—which are needed for “major Federal actions significantly affecting the \nquality of the human environment,” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C), or to determine that a project will not \nhave significant effects, id. § 4336—could include even non-federally funded projects that require \nfederal authorization, as did the Program.  Finally, the April 21 Letter threatens to withhold all \n“further obligations of FHWA funds (both formula and competitive) for projects within New York \nCity.”  The April 21 Letter does not explain the Secretary’s authority to take any of these \nenforcement measures, beyond citing 23 C.F.R. § 1.36 (which does not authorize the Secretary to \ndeem the Program “illegal,” let alone impose the sweeping “compliance measures” on account of \nits continued operation), and it does not cite any basis for these threatened actions other than the \ncontinued operation of the Program.   \n \n12  See  FHWA,  Advance  Construction  and  Partial  Conversion  of  Advance  Construction, \nhttps://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/finance/tools_programs/federal_aid/ac_pcac/, last accessed May 4, 2025. \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 32 of 80\nThe threatened enforcement measures, if taken, would deprive Plaintiffs and NYCDOT of \naccess to federal transportation funds, or the ability to initiate any new projects, shutting down \ncritical transportation investment in the nation’s largest city.  See Willens Decl. ¶ 24 (noting loss \nof STIP approvals would jeopardize funding for subway and bus maintenance, and railroad track \nwork, as well as other future projects requiring FTA funding); id.  ¶¶ 25-26 (describing projects \ncurrently funded by FHWA dedicated to improving air quality and funding accessibility upgrades \nto  public  transportation  infrastructure).    And  they  would  similarly  deprive  NYSDOT  and \nNYCDOT of funding for vital projects, thereby harming MTA’s ability to provide safe and reliable \nbus service on City streets.  Id. ¶ 30; see also Declaration of William Carry (“Carry Decl.”) ¶¶ 8-\n10 (explaining how withholding of advance construction authorizations and NEPA and STIP \napprovals would reduce NYCDOT’s project funding flexibility and halt many projects).  \nDefendants have left no doubt that they intend to impose “compliance measures” on May \n28 if Plaintiffs and NYCDOT do not end congestion pricing.  On April 24, a spokesperson for the \nUSDOT  stated,  “if  New  York  doesn’t  shut  it  down,  the  Department  of  Transportation  is \nconsidering halting projects and funding for the [S]tate.”13  On April 29, Duffy took to TV to \ncriticize the Program, telling the hosts of Good Day New York that if Plaintiffs and NYCDOT do \nnot “treat those who want to come into Manhattan fairly, maybe we should look at how much \nmoney we send the City.  And that’s what the Governor [of New York] is going to have to grapple \nwith.”14  That same day, counsel for Plaintiffs requested that Defendants agree not to take any \nenforcement action  or  postpone the April 21 Letter’s deadlines.

ECF 73. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nPlaintiffs are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because they have shown that “(1) \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the \npublic interest.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 477 F. Supp. 3d 279, 293 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).  \nWhere, as here, the federal government is the opposing party, the last two factors merge.  Id. at \n294 (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  “In deciding a motion for preliminary \ninjunction, a court may consider the entire record including affidavits and other hearsay evidence.”  \nPark Irmat Drug Corp. v. Optumrx, Inc., 152 F. Supp. 3d 127, 132 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting \nJohnson v. Newport Lorillard, 2003 WL 169797, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).15  Courts in this district \nrecognize that preliminary injunctions are essential tools “to preserve the status quo by preventing \nduring the pendency of the suit the occurrence of that irreparable sort of harm which the movant \nfears will occur.”  New York v. Rescue, 705 F. Supp. 3d 104, 118 (S.D.N.Y. 2023). \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should preliminarily enjoin Defendants from taking any of the actions outlined \nin the April 21 Letter or any other actions in retaliation for Plaintiffs’ refusal to comply with their \nunlawful demand to stop congestion pricing.  Defendants have no valid basis to implement \n“compliance measures” because the Program is authorized by the VPPP Agreement.  The February \n \n15 The Court is currently considering whether Defendants have waived privilege over a document that was filed to the \npublic docket and, according to news reports, establishes that Defendants’ stated rationales for terminating the VPPP \nAgreement are pretextual.  ECF 72.  Should the Court find that Defendants waived privilege, Plaintiffs respectfully \nrequest permission to submit a supplemental letter, limited to three pages, addressing this highly relevant evidence. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 34 of 80\n19 Letter “terminating” the VPPP Agreement rests on pretextual and borderline frivolous legal \narguments, to which the Court owes no deference.  Secretary Duffy’s “policy concerns” are \nunavailing; they are not only irrelevant as a matter of law but illegal, post hoc justifications, and \nDuffy has no authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement on his own.  Even if Defendants’ actions \nwith respect to the VPPP Agreement were lawful, that would not entitle them to withhold funds or \napprovals consistent with either the FAHA or the U.S. Constitution, and those threatened actions \nwould not only cause irreparable harm, but would be against the public interest. \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits \nA.  The Court has jurisdiction  \nAs an initial matter, this Court has jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause Plaintiffs assert federal constitutional, equitable, and statutory claims.  With respect to \nPlaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claims, the Court may grant relief under 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702 and 705 based on the “source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims,” \nand the “type of relief sought.”  Cohen v. Postal Holdings, LLC, 873 F.3d 394, 403 (2d Cir. 2017).  \nPlaintiffs seek to vindicate their statutory and constitutional rights, and—since we seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief and vacatur, not monetary damages—this case is at core a challenge to \nDefendants’ wrongful rescission of the VPPP Agreement, purported “termination” of the Program, \nand attempt to coerce compliance through the unlawful withholding of critical federal approvals \nfor transportation projects.  Although enjoining Defendants’ latest attempts to coerce compliance \nwith the February 19 Letter would result in the issuance of certain federal approvals, and lead to \nfunds being released to Plaintiffs, that is insufficient to divest the Court of jurisdiction to afford \nrelief under the APA or the Constitution.  See Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988); \nsee also Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. United States, 71 F.3d 475, 478 (2d Cir. 1995) (recognizing \ndistinction between (1) claims “for damages to compensate for the government’s failure to perform \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 35 of 80\na duty,” and (2) claims seeking “to require the government to perform its duty”); Linea Area \nNacional de Chile S.A. v. Meissner, 65 F.3d 1034, 1042 (2d Cir. 1995) (APA jurisdiction where \nplaintiff  sought  reimbursement  of  its  expenses  because  the  statute  required  government  to \nreimburse parties such as the plaintiff). \nWhile we expect that Defendants may raise it, Department of Education v. California is not \ninconsistent with these principles.  145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per curiam).  There, the “terms and \nconditions of [109] individual grant awards [were] at issue,” California v. Dep’t of Educ., 132 \nF.4th 92, 96-97 (1st Cir. 2025), and the plaintiffs fundamentally sought “to enforce a contractual \nobligation to pay money” and “represented … that they ha[d] the financial wherewithal to keep \ntheir programs running,” California, 145 S. Ct. at 968-69.  Here, Plaintiffs first and foremost \nchallenge  Defendants’  improper  agency  actions  of  rescinding  approval  under  the  VPPP,  a \nchallenge that unquestionably does not fall with the Tucker Act’s exclusive-jurisdiction provision.  \nPlaintiffs also seek to enjoin Defendants’ sweeping (and retaliatory) attempts to enforce the \nFebruary 19 termination by withholding certain necessary federal approvals.  Plaintiffs are not \nrelying on any federal funding agreements as a source of rights.  As numerous courts have \nrecognized since California, challenges like this are properly heard by the federal district courts.  \nSee, e.g., New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 1098966, at *1-2 (D.R.I. Apr. 14, 2025); Maine v. U.S. \nDep’t of Agric., --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 1088946, at *19 & n.8 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025).  It \nwould neither make sense nor be consistent with basic principles of substantial justice if the federal \ngovernment could divest a district court of jurisdiction in a pending case simply by threatening to \nwithdraw some aspect of the plaintiff’s federal funding. \nDespite Defendants’ assertions to the contrary, the instant motion is also ripe for resolution.  \nWhile Defendants in their April 21 Letter have purported to keep the door open by issuing an order \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 36 of 80\nto “show cause … why FHWA should not take appropriate steps under 23 CFR § 1.36 to remedy \nNew York’s noncompliance with 23 U.S.C. § 301 in connection with the [Program.],” Apr. 21 Ltr. \nat 1, there is no serious question that: (i) Defendants have already determined that the Program is \nnot compliant with Section 301; and (ii) they “will” therefore take some or all of the compliance \nmeasures identified in the April 21 Letter, id. at 2.  Indeed, in the April 21 Letter, Secretary Duffy \nreiterates that in the February 19 Letter, he “terminated” the VPPP Agreement (past tense), that \n“New York therefore is not legally permitted to collect tolls…,” id. at 1,16and that “New York \nrisks serious consequences if it continues to fail to comply with Federal law…,” id. (emphasis \nadded).   \nAs in Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120 (2012), Defendants’ February 19 Letter and compliance \norders constitute “final agency action” because they have “all of the hallmarks of APA finality,” \nincluding that “legal consequences will flow from issuance of the order.”  Id. at 127.  It does not \nmatter that Defendants may (putatively) invite Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenors to “engage in \ninformal discussion of the terms and requirements” or “inform” Defendants of any errors in their \nunderstanding of the facts and the law.  The mere possibility that an agency might reconsider in \nlight of informal discussion and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not suffice to make an \notherwise final agency action nonfinal.”  Id.  Judge Howell reached a similar conclusion in the \ncase involving the Executive Order issued against the law firm Perkins Coie.  See Perkins Coie \nLLP v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 1276857, at *24-25 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025) \n(challenge  was  ripe  because  “whatever  the  exact  guidance  ultimately  issued,”  “access  of \nemployees of Perkins Coie to federal buildings and government employees will be ‘limit[ed]’ as a \n \n16 Moreover, although Duffy claims to provide “notice” and an “opportunity to contest” under 2 C.F.R. § 200.342 in \nthe April 21 letter, this opportunity came weeks after the February 19 termination of the VPPP Agreement.  See \nClimate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., 2025 WL 842360, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025) (explaining that the OMB \nRegulations require an agency to “take certain procedural steps before it can terminate a federal award”).  \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 37 of 80\nresult”). Indeed, this case is on even firmer footing than Sackett because Defendants are not asking \nfor further information from Plaintiffs to determine whether they are “confident enough about \n[their] conclusion to initiate litigation.”  Id.  After all, they already have it—Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-\nIntervenors have spelled out in the Amended Complaint why the purported termination of the \nVPPP Agreement is unlawful.  First Amended Complaint ¶¶ 49-176; see also SAC ¶¶ 51-178. \nMoreover, even if Defendants were implying that they would re-open their determination \nthat the Program is invalid—and they have not—it could hardly be clearer under the circumstances \nthat any further consideration would be completely pretextual.  The April 21 Letter itself reiterates \nthat the VPPP Agreement was terminated, so any suggestion that said termination is being \nreconsidered would be in “name only.”  Mantena v. Hazuda, 2018 WL 3745668, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (declining to find “re-opening” of immigration proceeding rendered agency action non-final \nwhere “circumstances of reopening [were] suspect” because government did not “identif[y] issues \nwith  the  original  decision  [or]  areas  that  warranted  further  evidentiary  development”  and \ngovernment acted just nine days after plaintiff filed amended complaint). \nB.  The February 19 Letter is arbitrary and capricious  \nThe February 19 Letter, which serves as the purported basis for Defendants’ actions, is \nentirely inconsistent with the statutory scheme it seeks to enforce, and arbitrarily announces an \natextual interpretation of the FAHA in violation of the APA.  The VPPP, by its plain terms, \nauthorizes both “cordon pricing” and the use of toll revenue to support public transit, and Duffy \nfailed to adequately consider Defendants’ own long-held legal positions or Plaintiffs’ justifiable \nreliance on those positions, among other things. \n1.  Cordon Pricing \nIn the February 19 Letter, Duffy first and principally argues that 23 U.S.C. § 301 prohibits \n“tolls” on “roads constructed with Federal-aid highway funds,” “subject to limited exceptions,” \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 38 of 80\nand because the VPPP’s “value pricing pilot program,” is such an “exception,” it must be \n“narrowly construe[d]” to exclude “cordon pricing.”  Feb. 19 Ltr. at 2-3.  This is wrong. \nTo begin with, the VPPP is not an “exception” to Section 301’s toll ban.  The express \n“exception” to Section 301 is Section 129, which provides non-discretionary authority for tolling \non federal-aid highways under a wide variety of circumstances.  See 23 U.S.C. § 301 (“Except as \nprovided in Section 129…”); id. § 129 (setting forth various circumstances in which federal-aid \nhighways may be tolled).  The VPPP, on the other hand, is an additional, stand-alone program that \nCongress created for project sponsors to consider potential “value pricing pilot projects,” in which \nthe Secretary “shall solicit” participation.  VPPP, cl. 1.  To that end, the VPPP states that \n“[n]otwithstanding section 129 and 301,” tolling is permitted for “value pricing pilot programs.”  \nId., cls. 2, 4.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, this “notwithstanding” language “shows which \nof two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.”  N.L.R.B. v. SW General, Inc., 580 \nU.S. 288, 302 (2017).17 \nRather than putting a thumb on the scale, as Duffy does, the proper starting place in \ninterpreting the VPPP is the statutory text, “in accord with the ordinary public meaning of its terms \nat the time of its enactment.”  Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020).  Nothing in the \nplain language of the VPPP suggests that Congress required there to be other toll-free routes that \ncould be used to access the area subject to tolling.  To the contrary, the VPPP authorizes tolling as \npart of “value pricing pilot programs” without limitation.  VPPP, cl. 1. \nThere can be no serious dispute that the VPPP permits a broad set of programs including \n \n17 Even if the VPPP were an “exception” to Section 301, exceptions must be interpreted in the same manner as any \nother statutory provision.  See, e.g., BP P.L.C. v. Mayor of Balt., 141 S. Ct. 1532, 1538-39 (2021) (rejecting argument \nthat court must construe exceptions narrowly and explaining that courts have “no license to give statutory exemptions \nanything but a fair reading”); see also ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION \nOF LEGAL TEXTS 359 (2012) (rejecting the “false notion” that “tax exemptions—or any other exemptions for this \nmatter—should be strictly construed”).   \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 39 of 80\ncordon pricing.  When the VPPP was enacted into law in 1991, the Secretary was directed to solicit \nparticipation for “congestion pricing pilot programs,” later amended in 1998 to “value pricing pilot \nprograms.”  Id., cl. 1.  While neither term is defined in the statute, at the time of enactment, \n“congestion pricing” meant a charge (or price) intended to remedy or offset congestion.  See \nCongestion,  Cassell  Encyclopaedia  Dictionary,  312  (1990)  (defined  as  an  “abnormal \naccumulation  (of  inhabitants,  traffic  etc.”));  see  also  Congestion  Charging,  Black’s  Law \nDictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defined as “method of reducing traffic in major cities, esp. in city \ncenters, by charging drivers a fee to go beyond a certain point on the roads in the cities”).  Nothing \nin that definition suggests a limitation on the types of congestion pricing programs that may be \nimplemented, much less a ban on “cordon pricing.”  To the contrary, as noted, the very architect \nof congestion pricing, Professor Vickrey, proposed cordon pricing as the way to cure congestion \nin New York City, given the relatively narrow geography of Manhattan, the solution necessarily \ninvolves cordon pricing.  See supra at 10-11.  And by the time the VPPP was enacted, Singapore \nhad successfully operated a cordon pricing system for over 15 years, commonly referred to as a \n“congestion pricing program.”  See, e.g., Paul W. Wilson, Welfare Effects of Congestion Pricing \nIn Singapore, 15 TRANSP. 191, 191 (1988). \nThis  common  and  contemporaneous  understanding  of  the  term  “congestion  pricing” \npersisted over the next three decades, as Congress reauthorized the VPPP in 1995, 1998, and 2005.  \nShortly after the passage of ISTEA in 1991, Congress asked FHWA how it defined the term \n“congestion pricing” in the VPPP, and FHWA responded as follows: the “potential scope of \ncongestion pricing applications can vary widely, ranging from pricing on a new or existing single \nroad facility to more comprehensive area-wide road pricing strategies.” SAC ¶ 69 (emphasis \nadded).  From there, FHWA consistently understood congestion pricing to encompass—and in fact \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 40 of 80\nquintessentially cover—cordon pricing, and the agency even funded multiple cordon pricing \nstudies under the VPPP.  See supra at 11-12; SAC ¶¶ 82, 88, 92, 94.  Far from limiting project \nsponsors to any particular methodology, Congress continued to allow experimentation, which after \nall was the whole point of the VPPP in the first place.  See supra at 10-11; SAC ¶ 72.  Thus, the \n“contemporary legal context” in which Congress acted demonstrates that the ordinary meaning of \n“congestion pricing” included cordon pricing.  Fiero v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., Inc., 660 F.3d \n569, 577 (2d Cir. 2011); see also Wash. All. of Tech. Workers v. D.H.S., 50 F.4th 164, 182 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (“If Congress has continually declined to disturb a longstanding interpretation of a \nstatute,” it indicates Congress “at least acquiesces in, and apparently affirms, that interpretation”). \nNot surprisingly, this construction is supported by the broader statutory context as well.  \nISTEA is rife with limitations and specific definitions where Congress intended them, but there \nare no such limitations for the VPPP.  For example, in creating the Suspended Light Rail System \nTechnology Pilot Program, Congress described certain characteristics that any such program \n“shall” have.  ISTEA § 3030(c)(3).  The VPPP contains no such limitation: at most, beyond the \nbroad authorization to enter into “value pricing pilot programs,” it requires the Secretary to \n“monitor” the “effects such programs are having on driver behavior, traffic volume, transit \nridership, air quality, and availability of funds for transportation programs,” which requirements \nreflect a general  focus  on objectives like reducing congestion through reducing traffic and \npromoting other forms of transportation.  VPPP, cl. 5.  After all, this is not just the common \nunderstanding of Congress; it is simply common sense.   \nTo  the  extent  there  were  any  doubt,  the  fact  that  everyone  always  understood  that \ncongestion pricing encompassed cordon pricing is supported by the “mischief the statute sought to \nremedy,” Carroll v. Trump, 49 F.4th 759, 770-71 (2d Cir. 2022), as well as the legislative history, \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 41 of 80\nSpadaro v. U.S. C.B.P., 978 F.3d 34, 46 (2d Cir. 2020).  Indeed, during hearings leading to the \npassage of ISTEA, the bill’s sponsor, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, described Singapore as a \n“particularly interest[ing]” method of “congestion pricing,” and agreed that cordon pricing was a \npromising method of congestion pricing, explaining, “Singapore is doing it, Hong Kong is doing \nit, we are talking about it.”  SAC ¶ 74.  Likewise, in passing the Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990, Congress was clear that “transportation control measures” under that statute should include \ntolling vehicles “to enter central business districts.”  Id. ¶ 75.  Again, Congress has repeatedly said \nthe point of the VPPP was to encourage experimentation in order to curb congestion.  Id. ¶ 74.  \nDuffy’s reliance on 23 U.S.C. § 129(d)(4)(B) doesn’t work either.  Feb. 19 Ltr. at 3.  For \none thing, Section 129(d), which establishes the “Congestion relief program,” was enacted as part \nof the 2021 Infrastructure Jobs and Investment Act, and as a later law that is separate from the \nVPPP, it has no relevance to the meaning of the VPPP.  Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U.S. 250, 257-58 \n(2000) (“[L]ater laws that do not seek to clarify an earlier enacted general term and do not depend \nfor their effectiveness upon clarification, or a change in the meaning of an earlier statute, are beside \nthe point in reading the first enactment.”).  Regardless, the fact that Congress described projects \neligible for funding under that program to include “deployment and operation of a system that \nimplements or enforces high occupancy vehicle toll lanes, cordon pricing, parking pricing, or \ncongestion pricing,” hardly shows that the “value pricing pilot program” under the VPPP excludes \n“cordon pricing.”  Again, the VPPP broadly refers, without limitation, to “value pricing,” which \nhas always been understood to include cordon pricing.18  If anything, the list of examples in \n \n18 See Elena Safiorva et al., Choosing Congestion Pricing Policy: Cordon Tolls Versus Link-Based Tolls, 1932 J. OF \nTRANSP. RSCH. BD. (2005) (“Distributional effects of cordon and link-based tolls are also examined in the hope of \nunderstanding why one scheme might be preferred over another.”).   \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 42 of 80\nSection 129(d) again reflects Congress’s understanding of the diverse, non-exclusive methods that \nare encompassed under the umbrella term “congestion pricing.” \n2.  Revenue Objectives \nDuffy also claims that tolls cannot be “calculated based on considerations separate from \nreducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.”  Feb. 19 Ltr. at 3.  He then goes on to \nchastise the Program (which Defendants approved) for being “driven primarily by the need to raise \nrevenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  \nId.19  But this second rationale in the February 19 letter is just as invalid. \nFirst of all, the VPPP authorizes tolls on federal-aid highways.  It therefore follows that \n“raising revenue” is a permissible function of a VPPP program—that, of course, is what tolls do.  \nAnd while Duffy appears to take issue with the particular toll rates of the Program, nothing in the \nVPPP statute imposes limits on those rates.  Moreover, the statute explicitly provides that \n“[r]evenues generated” may be used to fund other transportation “projects eligible under” Title 23, \nincluding capital transit projects.  VPPP, cl. 4; cf. 23 U.S.C. § 129(d)(6)(B) (setting specific limits \non toll rates for separate “congestion relief program”).  As this Court has explained, and as Duffy \nis compelled to concede, see Feb. 19 Ltr. at 3, the statutory text makes it “unmistakably clear” that \n“a public authority [is] permitted to collect funds that exceed a toll road’s costs and spend those \nfunds on non-toll road projects,” Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at * 17. \n \n19 Duffy is mistaken in claiming that raising revenue is the “primary” driver of the Program.  Feb. 19 Ltr. 3.  The \nProgram has complementary goals of congestion reduction and providing MTA with a stable funding source, with the \nlatter also supporting congestion reduction by helping travelers shift modes from driving to transit.  See N.Y. Veh. & \nTraf. Law § 1701.  These dual goals were reflected in the EoI, see C. de Cerreño Decl., Ex. B, at 3-4, and the purpose \nand need for the Program was developed in consultation with FHWA, see SAC ¶¶116-24.  Indeed, FHWA previously \nacknowledged and defended these complementary objectives in filings before this Court.  See Chan, ECF 65 at 6, 9; \nChan, ECF 160 at 8.  Duffy’s clear factual error is another reason to find the February 19 Letter invalid.  See New \nYork v. H.H.S., 414 F. Supp. 3d 475, 545, 577 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (where agency’s stated justification for undertaking \nrulemaking was “factually untrue,” that “alone made the agency’s decision … arbitrary and capricious”).   \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 43 of 80\nDuffy’s position on revenue generation is also undermined by the rest of the VPPP.  Far \nfrom prohibiting consideration of revenue, Congress anticipated and even required States to \nconsider using excess revenues from congestion pricing programs as a funding source for public \ntransportation.  VPPP, cl. 4.  The VPPP instructs the Secretary to report to Congress “every 2 years \non the effects” that VPPP programs “are having on … transit ridership, air quality, and availability \nof funds for transportation programs.”  Id., cl. 5 (emphasis added).  And, in a separate section of \nISTEA, Congress directed that States “shall undertake a continuous transportation planning \nprocess,” which “shall” consider “the use of innovative mechanisms for financing projects, \nincluding … tolls [and] congestion pricing.”  ISTEA § 1025(a).  This, of course, is in keeping with \nthe broader intent of ISTEA, which was enacted to “develop a National Intermodal Transportation \nSystem” consisting “of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner,” id. § 2 \n(emphasis added), and to grant “states greater flexibility to operate toll facilities and use toll \nrevenues for a variety of transportation projects” including congestion pricing.  Chan, 2024 WL \n5199945, at *33; see also SAC ¶ 64-78 (collecting legislative history establishing Congress \nintended to permit the use of tolls to fund public transit programs). \nThe courts “do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted  from its adopted text \nrequirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.”  Mendis v. Filip, 554 F.3d 335, 340 n.5 (2d Cir. \n2009) (quoting Jama v. I.C.E., 543 U.S. 335, 341 (2005)).  This is particularly true where, as here, \nthe federal government’s proposed interpretation of a statute would curtail an area “of traditional \nState responsibility” like public transportation systems such as buses or subways.  Bond v. United \nStates, 572 U.S. 844, 858-59 (2014) (Congress must provide a “clear statement” if it seeks to \n“override the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers”); see also Evansville-\nVanderburgh Airport Auth. Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U.S. 707, 715 (1972) (describing \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 44 of 80\nStates’ traditional authority over road tolls).  Congress knows how to specify the factors that should \nor should not be considered in connection with projects authorized under Title 23, and it did not \ninclude any prohibition on the consideration of revenue in the VPPP.  See, e.g., 23 U.S.C. \n§ 106(a)(4) (cross-referencing 23 U.S.C. § 109); see also 49 U.S.C. § 60301(e).   \nThe Second Circuit considered an argument much like Duffy’s in American Trucking \nAssociations, Inc. v. New York State Thruway Authority, which concerned the use of toll revenue \nto fund New York’s canal system under another tolling provision in ISTEA.  886 F.3d 238, 246 \n(2d Cir. 2018) (citing ISTEA §1012(e)).  There, the Trucking Associations argued that the \nThruway Authority’s desire to use tolling revenue to fund New York’s canal program meant that \nthe challenged tolls were higher than they ought to be, and that Congress, in enacting ISTEA, had \n“meant to limit the amount” of tolls that could be collected “to fund unrelated projects.”  Id.  The \nSecond Circuit rejected this argument, holding that it was “unmistakably clear” that “Congress \nmeant to permit the Thruway Authority to continue collecting tolls of whatever amount” and to \nuse any “surplus revenue” for “other transportation projects.”  Id.  Like Section 1012(e), VPPP \nclause 3 permits toll revenues to be used for “any project eligible for assistance” under Title 23, \nincluding capital transit projects, without any limitation on the toll amounts. \nAgain, the whole point of the VPPP was to encourage experimentation through pilot \nprograms  intended  to  actually  reduce  congestion,  and  everyone  understood  that  meant  an \n“intermodal” approach where other forms of transportation, besides cars, were incentivized and \nsupported.    SAC  ¶  67.    Given  that  tolls  would  generate  revenue,  it  was  assumed—and \nencouraged—that those revenues would go toward other transportation methods to reduce traffic \ncongestion, like buses  or subways.   And on top of that, Congress  acquiesced to  FHWA’s \nlongstanding interpretation of the VPPP, see Fiero, 660 F.3d at 577; see also SAC ¶¶ 84-100 \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 45 of 80\n(collecting examples of FHWA recognizing VPPP permits revenue objective), by amending the \nVPPP four times without seeking to disturb that interpretation.20 \n3.  Defendants’ “policy concerns” \nAfter Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint detailing at length the deficiencies in Duffy’s \nstatutory analysis on April 18, Defendants realized they needed a new approach, so in their April \n21 Letter they sought to recast Duffy’s original termination decision as also resting on supposed \n“policy  concerns,”  including  the  alleged  “disproportionate  financial  hardship”  the  Program \nimposes and the “unconscionable” nature of “highway users” (i.e., drivers on the City’s streets) \n“being forced to bail out the MTA transit system.”  April 21 Ltr. at 2-3.  But the February 19 Letter \nis clear that these policy concerns merely prompted Duffy’s legal review, and that his ultimate \ndecision to terminate the VPPP Agreement rests on “two reasons” derived from his interpretation \nof  the  VPPP,  specifically  his  conclusions  that  (1)  cordon  pricing  “is  not  authorized  under \nCongress’ use of the phrase ‘value pricing pilot program,’” and (2) the “VPPP does not authorize \ntolls that are calculated based on considerations separate from reducing congestion.”  Feb 19. Ltr. \nat 3.  Having apparently realized the weaknesses of those justifications, Defendants do not get a \nsecond bite at the apple.  Where, as here, an agency issues a memorandum “to elaborate on the \nreasons” for the initial agency action, offering new and “separate,” policy reasons for action \nalready taken, those new reasons “can be viewed only as impermissible post hoc rationalizations.”  \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 21-22 (2020).  This would \n \n20 The Court does not owe any deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), to the February 19 \nLetter’s abrupt and poorly reasoned reversal of FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of the VPPP.  See In re Bernard \nL. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, 779 F.3d 74, 82 (2d Cir. 2015).  It is perfectly clear that the President set out to “kill” the \nProgram for political reasons and directed Secretary Duffy to manufacture a legal rationale for doing so, so that is \nwhat he did.  See supra.  An agency decision that contradicts an agency’s long-held view is entitled “to little, if any, \ndeference.”  SEC v. SIPC, 872 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2012).  FHWA has for many years had the authority to \nadminister the VPPP, 49 C.F.R. § 1.85(c)(22), and in that capacity, it has consistently and repeatedly concluded that \nthe VPPP permits cordon pricing as well as the consideration of revenue objectives.  See supra at 10-12; SAC ¶ 27.   \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 46 of 80\ninclude elevating policy concerns that were previously cited as commentary in the Feb. 19 letter \ninto  supposed  legal  rationales  for  the  decision  to  terminate.    And,  even  if  these  post  hoc \nrationalizations could be considered, they are flatly inconsistent (again) with the VPPP itself, \nwhich expressly contemplates the use of tolling revenues to promote mass transit as a means of \nreducing congestion, as well as with the extensive environmental review record in this case, which \nconcluded  that  the  Program  will  provide  substantial  benefits  to  low-  and  moderate-income \ncommuters.21  Moreover, even if the Court were willing to entertain Defendants’ policy rationales, \nand even assuming that Secretary Duffy’s decision was based on policy and not a legal infirmity \nin the VPPP Agreement, then the termination of the Agreement without any NEPA review was \nclearly in violation of law for the reasons explained infra, Point I.B.5.  In any event, Duffy’s \nconcern that “there are no toll-free alternative routes available to access the [CBD],” Apr. 21 Ltr. \nat 2, and purported belief that this is unprecedented or against preexisting USDOT policy, see \nGood Day New York, supra note 14, is unfounded.  FHWA has approved tolls on many routes \nthat do not provide for toll-free access, including several here in New York such as on the two I-\n278 bridges to Staten Island, as well as on two I-190 bridges to Grand Island, leaving no toll-free \nalternative routes to access either of those destinations.  It also defies belief that Duffy (a cabinet \nmember and New Jersey resident) would claim that absent the Program, New Jersey drivers could \naccess the CBD through a toll-free “roundabout way.”  Though technically true, the only such \noption would add approximately 300 miles to those drivers’ commutes, considering that the closest \nun-tolled Hudson River crossing is in Albany.  In short, Defendants are making it up as they go \nalong—the definition of arbitrary and capricious decision making. \n \n21  See  Final  EA  Chapter  6,  Economic  Conditions  at  6-47–49,  6-80–84  (Apr.  2023), \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/110831; Final EA Chapter 17, Environmental Justice at 17-62, 17-67–72 (Apr. \n2023), https://www.mta.info/document/110886 (describing  “substantial  benefits  associated  with  reduced  vehicle \ncongestion in the Manhattan CBD” and measures designed to lessen impacts on low-income drivers). \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 47 of 80\n4.  Defendants have no right to terminate the VPPP Agreement—regardless \nof their justification \nDefendants do not have the right to terminate the VPPP Agreement in any event.  As noted, \nthe VPPP Agreement itself says nothing about Defendants having a right to terminate.  Rather, it \nrefers to TBTA alone as having such right.  This reflects the parties’ understanding that the Program \nwould be long running (unless TBTA decided to end it).  The VPPP Agreement expressly refers \nto: (i) monitoring the Program for at least ten years, (ii) phasing in the tolls over a period of six \nyears, with ongoing tolling thereafter, and (iii) the TMA, which requires TBTA to raise $15 billion \nthrough the issuance of long-term bonds.  VPPP Agreement cls. 8(b), 11, Attach. A.  \nDefendants claim a right to terminate under the Uniform Guidance regulations issued by \nthe Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Regulations”), 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  But the problem \nfor Defendants is that those regulations actually make clear that if Defendants wanted to have a \nright to terminate, they were required to say so explicitly in the agreement.  See Singh v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Just., 461 F.3d 290, 296 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[A]n administrative agency must adhere to its own \nregulations.”).  Indeed, while the OMB Regulations permit unilateral termination by the recipient \nof an award, see 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(3), they do not include a similar provision allowing \nunilateral termination by an agency.22  Taken together, these regulations have been interpreted by \nfederal agencies as prohibiting agencies from unilaterally terminating awards, including for policy \nreasons.  See, e.g., Guidance for Federal Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 (Apr. 22, 2024).     \nTo be sure, Section 200.340(a)(4) permits termination by the agency when done “pursuant \n \n22 Moreover, under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341(a) and 342, even if an agency has a termination right (and Defendants do \nnot), it may terminate a cooperative agreement only after providing the recipient written notice and an opportunity to \nbe heard, which obviously did not occur here.  Recognizing their error on that front, Defendants belatedly claimed to \nprovide “notice” and an “opportunity to contest” in the April 21 Letter.  But that supposed opportunity came weeks \nafter the February 19 termination of the VPPP Agreement.  See Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., 2025 WL \n842360, *2, 8 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025) (OMB Regulations require agency to “take certain procedural steps before it \ncan terminate a federal award” (emphasis added)).   \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 48 of 80\nto the terms and conditions of the Federal award,” and even then, only to “the extent authorized \nby law.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 30089 (revised language of subsection \n(a)(4) only permits termination due to changes in “agency priorities” where such condition is \n“included in the terms and condition of the award”).  But that only proves our point.  Again, the \nVPPP Agreement says nothing at all in its terms and conditions about Defendants terminating it.  \nIn fact, precisely to prevent the sort of “pull out the rug from under them” behavior that Defendants \nwant to engage in here, the very regulations that Defendants invoke actually require that the \n“Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously specify all termination \nprovisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b) (emphasis \nadded); see, e.g., Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., 2025 WL 1131412, at *16 (D.D.C. Apr. \n16, 2025) (agency “can only terminate a federal award on this basis pursuant to the terms and \nconditions of the federal award”), stayed pending appeal, No. 25-5122 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 16, 2025).  \nFinally, because the VPPP Agreement, consistent with the VPPP, contemplates that the Secretary \nwill monitor the Program for “at least ten years,” and everyone (including FHWA) understood that \nthe Program would rely on tolling revenues to raise $15 billion in long-term bonds, only TBTA \nhas the right to terminate.  See Willens Decl. ¶¶ 4-11.   \nAll of this makes the instant case stand in stark contrast to cases where the grant agreement \nincluded or expressly incorporated language authorizing termination.   Cf. Sols. in Hometown \nConnections v. Noem, 2025 WL 1103253, at *4-5 (D. Md. Apr. 14, 2025) (grant included provision \nauthorizing DHS to terminate award due to changes in “agency priorities”).23  Had the federal \n \n23 Unable to point to any provision in the VPPP Agreement, Defendants rely on a document posted to their website \nentitled Contractors and Recipients General Terms and Conditions for Assistance Award (“General Terms”), which \nDefendants claim is “incorporate[d]” into the VPPP Agreement.  Apr. 21 Ltr. at 3-4.  But the VPPP Agreement does \nnot mention the General Terms and only states that the Project Sponsors will “comply with” federal laws and \nrequirements “applicable to this project.”  VPPP Agmt. cl. 9.  That simple agreement to “comply” obviously does not \n \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 49 of 80\ngovernment wished to have the right to unilaterally terminate congestion pricing, it could have \nnegotiated with the Project Sponsors to include a term authorizing termination in the VPPP \nAgreement (although the Project Sponsors would never have agreed, given the substantial cost to \ndevelop and set up the infrastructure for the Program and the need to interest investors in long-\nterm bonds supported by Program revenues).  The federal government did not include any such \nprovision, and cannot attempt to renegotiate now, particularly given that Defendants are not \ncontributing a dime to the Program, which involves areas of exclusively local concern to resolve \nNew York’s congestion problems through local means.   \nIn our legal system, the acts of executive branch officers “must be justified by some law, \nand in case an official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have \njurisdiction to grant relief.”  Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 108 (1902); \nsee also 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(C) (court must set aside agency action “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right”).  To the extent that Duffy claims \nsome free-ranging authority to revisit agency determinations and thereby terminate the VPPP, the \nproblem he has is that both statute and applicable regulations say otherwise.  See Chao v. Russell \nP. Le Frois Builder, Inc., 291 F.3d 219, 229 n.9 (2d Cir. 2002). \n5.  Defendants failed to conduct an environmental review under NEPA before \npurporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement \nTo the extent that Defendants now base the “termination” on policy grounds, that is also \nnot in accordance with law because Defendants failed to conduct an environmental review prior \n \nincorporate into the VPPP Agreement every Federal law, regulation and guidance document under the sun.  2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(b) (agreement must “unambiguously specify” termination conditions); PaineWebber Inc. v. Bybyk, 81 F.3d \n1193, 1201 (2d Cir. 1996) (in order to be incorporated by reference into an agreement, a paper “must be so referred to \nand described in the instrument that the paper may be identified beyond all reasonable doubt”).  And regardless, the \nGeneral Terms do not help Defendants because they are entirely circular, only authorizing termination “in accordance \nwith 2 C.F.R. § 200.340,” which itself requires the agency to include an agency termination provision in the terms of \nthe federal award.  \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 50 of 80\nto taking that action, as mandated by NEPA.  NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare an \nEnvironmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) for any “major federal action[] significantly affecting \nthe quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  In doing so, agencies are required \nto  take  a  hard  look  at  the  proposed  action’s  reasonably  foreseeable  social,  economic  and \nenvironmental impacts.  See, e.g., id. § 4336; 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(b); Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983).  To determine whether a major federal \naction  will  significantly  affect  the  quality  of  the  environment,  an  agency  may  prepare  an \nEnvironmental Assessment (“EA”).  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119.  If an \nagency determines that the proposed action will not have significant effects, accounting for \nmitigation, it may issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”).  42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); \n23  C.F.R.  §  771.121.    If  the  assessment  reveals  that  there  may  be  significant  effects,  an \nenvironmental impact statement is required.  42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2); 23 C.F.R. § 771.119(i). \nUSDOT  under  the  first  Trump  Administration  recognized  that  NEPA  required  an \nenvironmental review of the Program because Defendants’ approval of tolling authority under the \nVPPP qualified as a major federal action.  As a result, FHWA and the Project Sponsors conducted \nan exhaustive, multiyear NEPA review that culminated in a final EA and FONSI based on the \nProject Sponsor’s mitigation commitments, clearing the way for the parties’ execution of the VPPP \nAgreement.  Defendants’ purported termination of the VPPP Agreement would be no less major \nthan their execution of the Agreement in the first place, as it would have no less of an impact on \nthe environment and would significantly alter the status quo.  Indeed, considering that the EA and \nFONSI  identified  numerous  environmental  benefits  of  the  Program,  including  significant \nreductions in traffic congestion and air pollution regionwide, terminating the VPPP Agreement and \nhalting the Program (even assuming Defendants had the authority to do so, which they do not) \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 51 of 80\nwould  inevitably  increase  congestion  and  air  pollution,  among  potentially  other  adverse \nenvironmental consequences.  See, e.g., Upper Snake River Chapter of Trout Unlimited v. Hodel, \n921 F.2d 232, 234-35 (9th Cir. 1990) (“If an ongoing project undergoes changes which themselves \namount to major Federal actions, the operating agency must prepare an EIS.”) (citing Andrus v. \nSierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 363 n.21 (1979) (major federal actions include the “expansion or \nrevision of ongoing programs”)). \n6.  The MTA and TBTA’s reliance interests  \nDuffy’s purported “termination” is unlawful for yet another reason: he did not adequately \nconsider the MTA and TBTA’s significant reliance interests in the VPPP Agreement, FHWA’s \n2019 statement that the VPPP is the “best fit” for the Program, or FHWA’s longstanding \ninterpretation of the VPPP.  The “longstanding practice of the government—like any other \ninterpretive aid—can inform a court’s determination of what the law is.”  Loper Bright Enterprises \nv. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 386 (2024) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  As the \nSupreme Court has held, allowing agencies to reverse “consistent” and “longstanding” statutory \ninterpretations “affirmatively destroys,” rather than “safeguard[s],” reliance interests by giving \n“license” to “an agency to change positions as much as it likes.”  Id. at 386, 410-411.  Duffy’s \nreversal of the agencies’ decades-old, consistent interpretation of the VPPP flouts these principles, \nundermines the MTA and TBTA’s reliance interests, and is therefore entitled to no deference.  \nGarland v. Cargill, 602 U.S. 406, 412 (2024) (rejecting agency’s attempt to “abruptly reverse[] \ncourse” in its interpretation of gun laws); N.L.R.B. v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 525 (2014) \n(U.S. Supreme Court “has treated practice as an important interpretive factor even when the nature \nor longevity of that practice is subject to dispute”). \nEven if Defendants’ about-face on USDOT’s interpretation of the VPPP statute were a \nchange in policy (which it is not), it would still fail APA review.  Where an agency’s “prior policy \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 52 of 80\nhas engendered serious reliance interests,” the agency must “provide a more detailed justification \nthan what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  A failure to consider reliance interests or to fully explain an \nagency’s reasoning with respect to reliance interests renders an agency’s change in position \narbitrary and capricious under the APA.  See Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. at 33.  \nAnd Plaintiffs’ reliance on Defendants’ interpretation of the VPPP and on the VPPP \nAgreement in their financial planning to support and sustain the New York metropolitan region’s \npublic transit system is quite significant.  See SAC ¶ 101-02; see also C. de Cerreño Decl. ¶¶ 29-\n37.  For example, the MTA relies on Program revenues to fund critical aspects of its Capital \nProgram, in order to deliver critically needed public transit improvements.  See SAC ¶ 209-11; see \nalso  Willens  Decl.  ¶¶ 10-15    And  TBTA  has  already  substantially  relied  on  Defendants’ \ninterpretation of the VPPP and on the VPPP Agreement in incurring debt that will be repaid, at \nleast in part, by Program revenues.  See SAC ¶ 214; see also Willens Decl. ¶¶ 11-15.  Everyone \n(including FHWA) understood that the bonds, as 30-year bonds, would be paid from toll revenue \nover the length of their 30-year term.  See Willens Decl. ¶¶ 4-15.  Indeed, FHWA’s Re-evaluations \nwere explicit in that respect, noting that the net revenue would be dependent on the bonds’ “rates \nand terms.”  E.g., Re-Evaluation 2 at 8 n.2.   \nThere can be no doubt that FHWA well understood these reliance interests.  Indeed, FHWA \nconfirmed in recent court filings that it understood MTA’s financing plan was reliant on long-term \nProgram revenue to repay 30-year bonds.  See Manhattan Central Business District Tolling \nProgram Supplemental Memorandum at 20-22, New Jersey v. U.S Dep’t of Trans. et al., No 23 \nCiv. 03885 (Jan. 17, 2025), ECF 218-1 (confirming that declaration signed by MTA CFO Kevin \nWillens on January 2, 2025 explaining how the MTA and TBTA planned to issue long-term bonds \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 53 of 80\nto be repaid by Program revenue “reflects FHWA’s contemporaneous understanding of the \ninformation conveyed by the Project Sponsors before FHWA’s issuance of Re-Evaluation #2”).  \nAs the MTA’s CFO has explained, the MTA’s reliance on the long-term operation of the Program \nwas made crystal clear to FHWA during the development of the Program and negotiation of the \nVPPP.  See Willens Decl. ¶¶ 4-11 (explaining FWHA understood that the MTA could not have \nsigned a VPPP agreement that gave FHWA unilateral authority to terminate Program because \nfinancing $15 billion in capital improvements “is dependent on attracting investors to purchase \nlong-term bonds secured with Program revenue”).  “The MTA and TBTA have relied on the \ndurability of the VPPP Agreement in incurring” over a billion dollars in debt in the form of short-\nterm notes and loans.  Id. ¶¶ 12-15.  Moreover, Plaintiffs incurred substantial costs (some $500 \nmillion) in designing the Program, conducting lengthy environmental reviews, and installing the \nsystems necessary to collect tolls, all based on USDOT and FHWA’s consistent and longstanding \nstatutory interpretation that the agencies now disavow.  See  C. de Cerreño Decl. ¶¶ 29-37.   \nThe February 19 Letter gives superficial attention to these weighty reliance interests, \nignoring key facts.  Although the Letter mentions that “TBTA and NYSDOT have relied on the \n[VPPP] Agreement to begin collecting tolls,” Feb. 19 Ltr. at 4, it barely mentions—let alone \ndiscusses—Plaintiffs’ broader reliance interests.  For example, the Letter notes that “TBTA and \nNYSDOT have incurred costs related to the program,” but dismisses that reliance since the costs \n“were incurred before  FHWA signed the Agreement.”   Id.  But this leaves out Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantial reliance on Defendants’ “prior interpretation,” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), \nN.A., 517 U.S. 735, 746 (1996) (emphasis added), of the VPPP as permitting cordon-based tolling \nto raise revenue for mass transit, and Defendants’ representation in 2019 that the VPPP would be \nthe “best fit” for the Program.  C. de Cerreño Decl., Ex. C; see also Fox, 556 U.S. at 515 (focus is \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 54 of 80\non whether “prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests”) (emphasis added).  The Letter \nalso pays no heed to the substantial reliance interest even after the VPPP was signed.  See Willens \nDecl. ¶¶ 12-15.  This is not the kind of “detailed justification” that can support a reversal in legal \ninterpretation—or even a policy change—where the prior policy has engendered serious reliance \ninterests.  See Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515; see also Encino Motorcars, LLC v. \nNavarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016); see also Bondi v. VanDerStok, 145 S. Ct. 857, 873-74 (2025) \n(“novelty of” statutory interpretation is “strike against it,” and the “contemporary and consistent \nviews of a coordinate branch of government can provide evidence of the law’s meaning”). \nThe February 19 Letter also asserts that Plaintiffs’ reliance on Program revenues to fund \npublic transit improvements “was not reasonable given that FHWA approved only a ‘pilot \nproject,’” referring to the text of the VPPP, which authorizes “value pricing pilot projects.”  Feb. \n19 Ltr. at 4.  This is nonsensical.  The Program is a “pilot” only in the sense that the VPPP statute \nauthorizes projects to develop knowledge about the efficacy of congestion pricing strategies.  \nIndeed, to the extent the VPPP itself says anything about the anticipated length of the Program, it \nsays that the “Secretary shall monitor the effect of such programs for a period of at least 10 years,” \nVPPP § 5 (emphases added).  This obviously is inconsistent with the Secretary being able to \nterminate the Program mere months in (and consistent with the notion that the Program will run \nunless and until TBTA decides to stop it).24  No sane State government or agency (including \nPlaintiffs) would spend years studying the potential environmental effects of a program in advance \n \n24 By contrast, when Congress wanted particular programs or grants to have time limitations under Title 23, it said so, \nand in many instances required the agreement to say so, too.  See, e.g., 23 U.S.C. § 112(b)(4)(C)(v);  id. § 131(e) \n(requiring states to remove non-conforming signs or displays within five years of statute’s enactment); id. § \n151(f)(6)(C)(i) (allowing grant recipients to provide funds to private entities operating publicly available electric \nvehicle charging infrastructure for the first five years of operation). \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 55 of 80\nof  implementation  and  would  invest  a  half-billion  dollars  in  planning,  technology,  and \ninfrastructure if the project were intended to be short-term or could be summarily struck down. \nContrary to the implication in the February 19 Letter that Plaintiffs’ reliance was not \nreasonable because “FHWA’s approval was not authorized by law,” Plaintiffs acted reasonably in \nrelying on Defendants’ longstanding interpretation of the VPPP, including FHWA’s representation \nto Plaintiffs that it was the “best fit” for the Program.25  It was not unreasonable—indeed, it was \neminently  reasonable—for  Plaintiffs  to  rely  on  FHWA’s  consistent  and  well-grounded \ninterpretation of the VPPP dating back to its implementation, when there was no prior indication \nthat the agency might suddenly make a 180-degree change in course.  FHWA’s prior interpretation \nof the VPPP is consistent with the statute’s plain text, has never been challenged in court, and has \nnever been found by any court to be unauthorized.  Moreover, the Supreme Court in Regents \nrejected the argument that a federal agency need not seriously consider reliance interests when the \nagency determines that its prior policy was not legally authorized.  See 591 U.S. at 33.  As the \nCourt explained there, even where an agency determined that its prior policy was illegal, “nothing \nabout that determination foreclosed or even addressed the option[] of … accommodating particular \nreliance interests,” and the agency’s failure to do so was “arbitrary and capricious.”  Id.  So too \nhere.  The February 19 Letter merely points to its cursory and ill-founded determination of \nillegality without truly taking into account Plaintiffs’ substantial reliance interests.   \nC.  Defendants’ proposed enforcement \nEven if the February 19 Letter were not unlawful, and the termination of the VPPP \nAgreement were valid, Defendants would not have license to effectively shut off funding and \n \n25 While Duffy claims to rest his decision on his legal interpretation of the VPPP, the record here is very clear that \nDuffy’s explanation is pretextual in nature and that President Trump directed him to find a way to end the Program \nfor political reasons.  See, e.g., Feb. 19 Ltr. at 1 (President Trump directed “review” of “approval of the [Program]” \nin light of the President’s policy concerns); see also Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780 (2019). \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 56 of 80\napprovals for virtually any and every federal-aid highway project, as they have threatened to do.  \nRather, under the FAHA and basic constitutional principles, their recourse, if any, is limited.  \n1.  Defendants lack authority to impose the sanctions threatened in the April \n21 Letter \nDefendants do not point to any authority in the VPPP Agreement or the FAHA that would \nauthorize  the  unprecedented  sanctions  outlined  in  the  April  21  Letter,  which  include  the \nwithholding of federal funds, advance construction authorizations, approvals to STIP amendments, \nand NEPA approvals.  They rely instead on a single regulation, 23 C.F.R. § 1.36, that is ostensibly \nauthorized under FHWA’s general authority to “prescribe … needful rules and regulations for the \ncarrying out of the provisions of this title.”  23 U.S.C. § 315.  According to Defendants, that \nregulation gives the Executive branch free range to take a sledgehammer to the budgets of MTA \nand TBTA (and NYSDOT and NYCDOT) unless and until Plaintiffs “cry uncle” and give up the \nProgram.  But Section 1.36 does not, by its terms, give Defendants that power, nor could it here. \nAs an initial matter, the plain language of Section 1.36 does not authorize the extremely \nbroad sanctions contemplated in the April 21 Letter.  The regulation “applies only if a State fails \nto comply with or violates federal law,” and the Program is authorized under the non-terminable \nVPPP Agreement.  Tennessee ex rel. Leech v. Dole, 567 F. Supp. 704, 718 (M.D. Tenn. 1983), \nrev’d on other grounds, 749 F.2d 331 (6th Cir. 1984).  It is not enough that Defendants no longer \nlike congestion pricing and want it to stop; the Program is authorized under federal law.   \nBut even if the VPPP Agreement were in violation of federal law, Defendants’ threatened \n“compliance measures” go well beyond the terms of Section 1.36 and are not authorized here.  \nSection 1.36 sets out three avenues of potential enforcement: (i) withholding federal funds under \nTitle 23 “on account of” the Program, (ii) withholding “approval of further projects in the State” \nunder Title 23; and (iii) “other action that [the Administrator] deems appropriate under the \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 57 of 80\ncircumstances.”  Section 1.36 does not say that all three avenues of enforcement will be appropriate \nin any given circumstance, nor does it purport to give Defendants authority to hold up New York’s \nappropriated and authorized federal-aid highway funding (and more).  \nStart with the first clause of Section 1.36.  Here, of course, there are no funds “on account \nof” the Program because Congress no longer appropriates funds under the VPPP.  Every penny of \nfunding for the VPPP comes from sources other than the federal government.  Perhaps, if \nDefendants had provided funding under the VPPP Agreement and subsequently determined that \nthe Program is not authorized, and had the right to terminate, they could then withhold that \nparticular stream of funding.  But the VPPP Agreement does not give them any such role or right. \nBeyond that, the second and third clauses of Section 1.36—withholding “approval of \nfurther projects” and “other action … appropriate under the circumstances”—clearly do not \nauthorize Defendants to take the sweeping actions outlined in the April 21 Letter and, if they did, \nthey would exceed the agency’s authority under the authorizing statute, 23 U.S.C. § 315.  Where \na statute delegates authority to an agency, “the role of the reviewing court under the APA” is to \n“fix the boundaries of the delegated authority” and “police the outer statutory boundaries of those \ndelegations.”  Loper Bright Enters., 603 U.S. at 395, 404 (cleaned up).  The limited authority that \nCongress granted to FHWA to make “needful rules,” 23 U.S.C. § 315, “does not provide the \nAdministrator with carte blanche authority to promulgate any rules, on any matter relating to the \n[FAHA], in any manner that the Administrator wishes,” Citizens to Save Spencer Cnty. v. EPA, \n600 F.2d 844, 873 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (construing similar language in statute authorizing EPA \nrulemaking).  Indeed, where Congress intends to grant an agency enforcement authority, it has said \nso clearly.  See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n)(9)(D) (authorizing Comptroller of the Currency to \n“prescribe regulations necessary to enforce compliance”); 7 U.S.C. § 1375(b) (same for Secretary \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 58 of 80\nof Agriculture).  The narrow authority provided in Section 315, by contrast, “is not open-ended, \nparticularly when there is statutory language on point,” and it cannot override more specific \nprovisions elsewhere in the statute.  N.R.D.C. v. EPA, 749 F.3d 1055, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(construing EPA statute); see also Bloate v. United States, 559 U.S. 196, 207 (2010).   \nAnd so, the Secretary has no power to withhold STIP amendments, advance construction \nauthorizations, or NEPA approvals in response to an alleged violation of 23 U.S.C. § 301—as he \nthreatens to do throughout New York State.  None of that is remotely authorized under the FAHA.  \nDefendants’ intent to withhold NEPA approvals for projects also conflicts with the agency “action-\nforcing procedures” enacted by Congress.  Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 350 (1979).  \nDefendants cannot withhold approvals, because they are mandated to “perform the work necessary \nto complete the environmental review process.”  23 C.F.R. §771.113(a).  At no time in the lengthy \nNEPA process does a federal agency have the discretion to withhold its participation.  See 23 \nC.F.R. § 771.111(b)(2) (“Administration must respond in writing to a project sponsor’s formal \nproject notification within 45 days.”); 23 C.F.R. § 771.121(a) (“Administration will review the \n[Environmental Assessment]”); 23 C.F.R. § 771.123(g) (“Administration … will approve the draft \n[Environmental Impact Statement] for circulation”); 23 C.F.R. § 771.124(a)(5) (“Administration \nmust indicate approval of the combined final [Environmental Impact Statement]/[Record of \nDecision]”); 23 C.F.R. § 771.125(c) (“Administration will indicate approval of the [Environmental \nImpact Statement]for an action by signing and dating the cover page”).26 \nNor can Duffy, in response to a purported violation of Section 301’s tolling ban through \nthe  continued  operation  of  a  single  project—congestion  pricing—broadly  withhold  project \n \n26 Nor do Defendants have authority to instruct that all NEPA approvals be categorically denied.  See Forest Guardians \nv. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 611 F.3d 692, 714-15 (10th Cir. 2010) (NEPA analysis “must be taken objectively and \nin good faith, ... and not as a subterfuge designed to rationalize a decision already made”) (internal citations omitted).  \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 59 of 80\napprovals under Title 23.  Congress has foreclosed that means of enforcement in at least two ways.  \nFirst, Defendants’ intent to withhold “obligations of FHWA funds” conflicts with the detailed \nstandards enacted by Congress to guide the Secretary in carrying out his duty to promptly authorize \nthe obligation of Title 23 funding.  See 23 U.S.C. § 106(a)(2) (Secretary “shall act” as “soon as \npracticable” on submissions for obligations of funds); id. § 106(a)(4) (in granting submissions for \nobligations, Secretary “shall be guided” by criteria in 23 U.S.C. § 109).  Indeed, it is long settled \nthat the Executive has no right to broadly impound funds for policy reasons.  See State Highway \nComm’n v. Volpe, 479 F.2d 1099, 1118 (8th Cir. 1973) (no discretion to withhold obligations due \nto status of the economy or need to control inflation); Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. Brinegar, 388 F. \nSupp. 1319, 1325 (D.D.C. 1975) (FAHA “does not authorize” discretionary withholding of \nobligations  “for  non-program  related  reasons”);  23  U.S.C.  § 101(c)  (“no  part  of  any  sums \nauthorized to be appropriated … shall be impounded or withheld from obligation”).27   \nSecond, the FAHA sets forth in great detail the many specific, limited ways in which \nobligated funds could be withheld for specific violations of the FAHA.  Some of these remedies \naffect the State’s apportionment of funds from the Highway Trust Fund.  See, e.g., 23 U.S.C. \n§ 131(b) (for enforcement of the Highway Beautification Act, Secretary may reduce federal \nfunding allocations by 10%); id. § 158(a) (for enforcement of minimum age drinking laws, \nSecretary may reduce allocations by 8%).  Others grant the Secretary the power to direct public \nauthorities  “to  discontinue  collecting  tolls”  in  circumstances  not  present  here.    E.g.,  id. \n§ 129(a)(3)(C), (a)(9)(C).  Notably, the VPPP statute and Section 301 do not authorize the \nSecretary to direct an end to tolling operations or otherwise seek to impose a penalty.  The fact \n \n27 The MTA, TBTA and NYCDOT incorporate by reference the additional statutory arguments advanced by Plaintiff-\nIntervenor NYSDOT on pages 12 to 15 of the Memorandum of Law In Support of Intervenor-Plaintiff New York \nState Department of Transportation’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.  \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 60 of 80\nthat Congress granted FHWA enforcement authority in some circumstances, but did not do so with \nrespect to Section 301 or the VPPP, is a strong indication that FHWA’s authority to enforce \ncompliance in these circumstances is limited.  See, e.g., Avon Nursing & Rehab. v. Becerra, 995 \nF.3d 305, 311 (2d Cir. 2021) (“Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a \nstatute but omits it in another, we presume that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the \ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.”) (cleaned up).  And it is not particularly surprising here, given \nthat—again—the VPPP and VPPP Agreement simply do not contemplate any right of termination \nby Defendants.  See generally Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988) (“It \nis axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited \nto the authority delegated by Congress.”).  Moreover, while the scope of the enforcement measures \nset forth in the April 21 Letter appears to include withholding of STIP amendments that would \nallow for FTA funding for transit, that cannot be even arguably encompassed within a reading of \nSection 1.36 as a valid regulation under the FAHA. \n2.  Enforcing the February 19 Letter would violate the Pennhurst clear \nstatement rule \nEven if Duffy were somehow right that the VPPP did not authorize congestion pricing \n(which it does), and that he had authority to terminate the Program (which he does not), his attempt \nto enforce that determination through the wholesale withholding of federal approvals to New York \nto  coerce  termination  of  the  Program  would  run  into  another  insurmountable  obstacle:  the \nConstitution.  The Spending Clause provides that Congress “shall have Power to lay and collect \nTaxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and \ngeneral Welfare of the United States….”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  Even where Congress seeks \nto condition receipt of funds, such conditions must be “unambiguous[]” and they cannot “surprise[] \nparticipating States with post acceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 61 of 80\nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 25 (1981).  Once a State has accepted funds pursuant to a \nfederal spending program, the federal government cannot alter the conditions attached to those \nfunds so significantly as to “accomplish[ ] a shift in kind” of their policy.  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 583-84 (2012).  This “clear statement rule” applies equally to the \nimposition of affirmative, and as here, negative obligations on the receipt of funds.  See Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186 n.1 (2002) (citation omitted). \nThere  is  no  question  that  Defendants’  newly  announced  term—complying  with  a \ncompletely  new  and  unprecedented  interpretation  of  the  VPPP—was  not  expressed \n“unambiguously” and with a “clear voice” by Congress.  See Texas v. Cardona, 743 F. Supp. 3d \n824, 885 (N.D. Tex. 2024) (granting injunctive relief against Secretary of Education where new \nTitle IX guidance conditioned funding on novel interpretation of statute).  Nothing in ISTEA or \nany of its reauthorizations comes anywhere close to “unambiguously” prohibiting cordon pricing \nthat  finances  transit  programs,  and  as  discussed  supra  at  10-12,  the  legislative  history \nunambiguously indicates that Congress sought to encourage projects akin to the Program.  Thus, \nwithholding approvals for other projects on account of the Program’s continued operation is an \nimposition of new conditions and is unconstitutional under the Spending Clause.  See West Virginia \nex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1142 (11th Cir. 2023) (granting State’s \nmotion for permanent injunction where provision of American Rescue Plan prohibited states from \nusing federal funds to directly or indirectly offset reduction in net tax revenue, finding statute \nlacked a clear statement from Congress authorizing the new condition).28     \n \n28 This lack of a clear statement by Congress is exacerbated by the fact that the VPPP Agreement, again, does not \ncontemplate a right of termination by Defendants, the FAHA’s baseline rule is that funds cannot be withheld, and the \nstatute sets out in great detail how and when Congress has authorized withholding—none of which apply to the VPPP. \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 62 of 80\n3.  Defendants’ withholding of federal funding is unconstitutionally coercive \nWhen Congress or a federal agency alter funding conditions so as to coerce the State to \nchange its behavior, they encroach on State sovereignty as guaranteed by the Tenth Amendment \nby “commandeering … reserved State power.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 951 F.3d 84, 115 \n(2d Cir. 2020).  As the Supreme Court recognized in South Dakota v. Dole, conditions on federal \ngrants may be illegitimate if they are unrelated “to the federal interest in particular national projects \nor programs” or where “the financial inducement” is “so coercive as to pass the point at which \npressure turns into compulsion.” 483 U.S. 203, 207, 211 (1987).  Where an agency issues a “threat \nto a State to ‘do this, or else’” it is “coercive at the moment it is uttered” particularly when \nconsidering “scale of funding it jeopardizes and the new standards of conduct the [agency] \nimposes.”  New York v. H.H.S., 414 F. Supp. 3d 475, 571 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (HHS threats to withhold \nall funding for noncompliance with novel “conscience regulations” violated Spending Clause and \nTenth Amendment.). \nHere, Defendants’ threats to withhold all future project approvals and all FHWA funds run \nafoul of both principles.  First, there is neither a federal nor national interest in prohibiting cordon \npricing or the spending of Program revenues on transit services.  In Dole, the Supreme Court \nconcluded that the withholding of approximately 5% of previously allocated federal-aid highway \nfunds was not so coercive where Congress sought to promote the national interest of a minimum \ndrinking age.  483 U.S. at 207, 211.  Here, the Program is a project required by State law, and it \nimposes a toll on vehicles entering a select portion of a single borough within one metropolitan \narea.  If anything, ISTEA and its reauthorization statutes indicate a national interest in reducing \ncongestion in certain localities and supporting the completion of transit projects, exactly as \ncongestion pricing does.  See e.g., 23 U.S.C. § 129(d) (“Congestion Mitigation Program”); id. § \n149 (“Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program”); ISTEA § 2 (describing \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 63 of 80\npolicy of “develop[ing] a National Intermodal Transportation System that is economically efficient \nand  environmentally  sound,”  which  “shall  include  significant  improvements  in  public \ntransportation….”).  The only purported interest Duffy invokes is in avoiding additional costs to \ndrivers on a fraction of New York’s federal-aid highways paid for with taxpayer dollars, but that \nis an economic interest of particular motorists accessing the CBD, not a federal or national interest.  \nMoreover, any underlying federal policy of avoiding tolls on federal-aid highways as expressed in \nSection 301 has been overtaken by ISTEA’s countervailing policy of flexibility and promotion of \nintermodal transportation systems and congestion reduction.  Defendants’ interpretation of federal \nlaw thus undermines real federal interests at stake—reducing congestion, improving air quality, \nand facilitating intermodal transportation—thereby providing an independent basis to reject his \ninterpretation on Tenth Amendment grounds.  See Texas, 743 F. Supp. 3d at 886 (rejecting updated \nTitle IX funding conditions in part, because they undermined national interest expressed in statute). \nSecond, tying receipt of future project approvals, and potentially all FHWA and even FTA funds \n(required by formula or otherwise) to topping congestion pricing is unconstitutionally coercive.  In \nSebelius,  the  Supreme  Court  rejected  conditions  on  Medicaid  funds—where  the  federal \ngovernment generally contributed 50 to 83 percent of total funds—because those conditions were \nan unlawful “means of pressuring the States to accept policy changes.”  567 U.S. at 580.  The \nfederal funding at issue here is roughly identical to that at issue in Sebelius.  By way of illustration, \nthe 2020-2024 MTA Capital Plan, financed in part by the Program’s revenues, assumes a 50/50 \ncost split between federal and local sources for critical transit projects such as the Second Avenue \nSubway.29  Total federal funding for the 2020-2024 Capital Plan is estimated to be $13.1 billion, \n \n29  MTA,  MTA  CAPITAL  PROGRAM  2020–2024  (Sept.  25,  2019),  https://files.mta.info/s3fs-public/2019-\n09/MTA%202020-2024%20Capital%20Program%20-%20Executive%20Summary.pdf.  \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 64 of 80\nout of a total expected cost of $54.8 billion.30  That $13.1 billion represents 23% of all of the \nMTA’s funding for capital projects, much greater than the amount at issue in Dole.  See 483 U.S. \nat 211.  The total $54.8 billion cost of the Capital Plan also includes $15 billion in Program \nrevenues that are dedicated to transit improvements in the New York City metropolitan region, \nwhich is of course essential to the State’s economy.  As in Sebelius, where roughly half of all \nMedicaid funds were at issue, here a directive that the “the Secretary ... may declare that ‘further \npayments will not be made to the State,’” unless the Program is ceased (in violation of the TMA), \nconstitutes “a gun to the head” and is invalid under the Tenth Amendment.  567 U.S. at 581.  The \ncoercive force of these measures is further multiplied by Defendants’ stated plan to also withhold \nfederal approvals and funding from other parts of the State. \nII.  The MTA and TBTA have shown irreparable harm  \nA party can establish irreparable harm by demonstrating that it will suffer “an actual and \nimminent” injury that cannot be remedied “if a court waits until the end of trial to resolve the \nharm.”  Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 481 F.3d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 2007).  That \nstandard is readily met here, given the remarkably broad scope of the coercive threats to halt \nreviews needed for all projects and funding within FHWA’s purview State wide, including billions \nof dollars’ worth of funding for transit projects currently proposed for addition to New York’s \nSTIP, unless the Program is halted.  “Damocles’s sword does not have to actually fall ... before the \ncourt will issue an injunction.”  League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \nDefendants  threaten  to  pursue  wide  range  of  illegal  retaliatory  actions,  including \nwithholding any further approvals of STIP amendments concerning NYMTC TIP modifications \nand prohibiting any further obligations of FHWA funds.  See April 21 Ltr. at 2.  Such threats seek \n \n30 MTA, 2024–2029 CAPITAL PLAN 34 (Sept. 25, 2024), https://www.mta.info/document/151266.    \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 65 of 80\nto force on the Project Sponsors a Hobson’s choice: either forgo all funding and projects requiring \nFHWA actions—which include billions of dollars’ worth of funding for MTA projects provided \nin a recent proposed STIP amendment and projects for which the MTA receives FHWA funding—\nor abruptly halt the Program, forfeiting a secure and recurring source of revenue supporting the \nissuance of bonds to fund capital improvements critical to the reliability, accessibility, expansion, \nand safety of the MTA’s regional public transit system, as well as the additional public benefits \nfrom reduced congestion and vehicular emissions.  Either option would have severe and irreparable \nharmful consequences.   \nNumerous courts have found that the loss of expected federal approvals or funding, \nincluding where the termination has not yet gone into effect or where the federal funds were \neventually distributed, is sufficient to find irreparable harm due to the budgetary and planning \nuncertainties it may cause, and by virtue of the deprivation of constitutional rights under the \nSpending Clause.  See City and County of San Francisco v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL \n1186310, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2025) (where President directed federal agencies to withhold \nfederal funds from so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions,” plaintiffs’ irreparable injury was “in the \nform of a budgetary uncertainty” and “undermining trust between [plaintiffs] and the communities \nthey serve” as well as “deprivation of constitutional rights”); New York v. Trump, 2025 WL \n715621, at *13, 15 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025) (granting preliminary injunction where OMB froze broad \ncategories of federal grant money allocated to various states, including reimbursement of spending \nfor critical transportation infrastructure, due to “chaos and uncertainty” initial freeze caused, and \nnoting that “States may have to suspend, delay or cancel projects”); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. \nO.M.B., 2025 WL 597959, at *18 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (recognizing irreparable harm where “a \npause on federal funding w[ould] ‘threaten[] the very existence of [non-profit organizations’] \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 66 of 80\nbusiness”) (citations omitted); Planned Parenthood of Greater Wash. & N.

Trump, 250 F. Supp. \n3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (uncertainty prompted by federal executive order threatening to \nwithhold funds from “sanctuary jurisdictions” caused irreparable harm by “interfer[ing] with the \nCounties’ ability to budget, plan for the future, and properly serve their residents” and by requiring \nthem to take “mitigating steps,” including placing funds in reserve or making cuts to other \nservices); United States v. North Carolina, 192 F. Supp. 3d 620, 630 n.2 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (holding \nthat although it was “not immediately clear … how much funding [plaintiffs] would lose during \nthe pendency of [the] case” or “precise timing of specific grants,” court was “satisfied that the loss \nof funding … [would] likely be severe enough to constitute irreparable harm” given the “nature of \nthe services” at risk, including services to assist victims of sexual assault).    \nIndeed, Defendants’ unconstitutional threats, intended to coerce the State of New York to \nabandon the Program, have already caused an independent irreparable injury.  Limits on the \nSpending  Clause  coupled  with  the  Tenth  Amendment  protect  “the  status  of  the  States  as \nindependent sovereigns in our federal system.”  Sebelius, 567 U.S. at 577.  Here, Defendants seek \nto impose retroactive conditions on the receipt of federal funds to hobble programs meant to further \nNew York’s sovereign interests, irreparably harming State sovereignty.  Georgia v. Pruitt, 326 F. \nSupp. 3d 1356, 1367 (S.D. Ga. 2018) (“[l]oss of sovereignty is an irreparable harm”); see Akiachak \nNative Cmty. v. Jewell, 995 F. Supp. 2d 7, 17 (D.D.C. 2014) (recognizing loss of State sovereignty \nas an irreparable harm).  And as discussed supra at 49-50, an agency’s threat to take compliance \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 67 of 80\nactions is “coercive at the moment it is uttered.”  New York, 414 F. Supp. 3d at 571.  It is for that \nreason courts recognize that forcing compliance with an unlawful agency demand “almost always \nproduces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.”  Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, \n433 (5th Cir. 2016) (emphasis in original) (quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. \n200, 220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in the judgment)).   \nWhat’s  more,  Defendant’s  deprivation  of  Plaintiffs’  property  interest  in  the  VPPP \nAgreement in violation of due process is itself the type of constitutional harm that is “ordinarily” \nirreparable.  A.H. by & through Hester v. French, 985 F.3d 165, 176 (2d Cir. 2021) (constitutional \ndeprivation that results in non-compensable damages ordinarily warrants a finding of irreparable \nharm).  Here, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they were deprived of procedural due process, as \ntheir interests in the VPPP agreement were “terminated” without any due process despite the post-\ndecisional and disingenuous offer of an illusory opportunity to challenge a decision that was \nalready announced and which Defendants have clearly stated they are not reconsidering.  See SAC \n¶¶ 22-37 and ¶¶ 202-04.  That termination will result in injuries not compensable through monetary \ndamages, and thus “no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”  See Broecker v. N.Y.C. \nDep’t of Educ., 585 F. Supp. 3d 299, 310 (E.D.N.Y. 2022), aff’d, 2023 WL 8888588 (2d Cir. Dec. \n26, 2023) (allegation of deprivation of due process rights constituted irreparable injury).  \nThese common-sense principles are illustrated here when one considers the sheer breadth \nof Defendants’ threats.  The “compliance measures” threatened by the April 21 letter are extensive \nand specific, though the full extent of some are indeterminate, which only adds to their intended \ncoercive effect.  For the MTA, which receives most federal funding through FTA under Title 49, \nthe primary source of budgetary uncertainty and, indeed, imminent harm (separate from the \nimminent harm that would arise from halting the Program) comes via Defendants’ specific threat \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 68 of 80\nto  withhold  approvals  of  STIP  amendments  concerning  NYMTC  TIP  modifications.    The \nthreatened withholding of all STIP approvals threatens billions of dollars in annual congressionally \nappropriated funding the MTA receives from FTA.  Willens Decl. ¶¶ 230-25.  This threat already \npresents imminent harm: NYSDOT recently submitted a proposed STIP amendment concerning a \n$2.2 billion package of projects for maintenance and railroad track work that is at risk.  Id. ¶ 25.    \nIn addition to threatening to withhold approvals of STIP amendments, Defendants have \nthreatened to stop obligating all FHWA-administered funds.  The MTA regularly receives FHWA \nfunding through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (“CMAQ”) section of Title 23, 23 \nU.S.C. § 149, which is intended to help meet the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act \n(“CAA”) through transportation measures.  Id. ¶¶ 26-29.  The MTA uses the majority of its CMAQ \nfunding for projects under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).  Id. ¶ 27.  These projects \ncontribute to reductions in vehicle miles traveled (“VMT”) and associated emissions, improving \nair quality, and reducing regional congestion.  Id.  More specifically, the installation of ADA-\ncompliant  elevators  and  equipment  at  previously  non-accessible  stations  increases  subway \nridership and reduces reliance on vehicular modes of transportation such as taxis, for-hire-vehicles, \nprivate vehicles, and paratransit services like Access-A-Ride.  Id.  Consequently, increased use of \npublic transit reduces VMT and resultant emissions as well as congestion.  Id. \nThe MTA’s extensive bus operations will also be harmed, as they operate on roadways \nthroughout the City that are maintained by NYCDOT in part using FHWA funding.  Id. ¶ 30.  The \nMTA  and  New  York  City  Transit,  an  operating  agency  of  the  MTA,  oversee  a  fleet  of \napproximately 5,800 buses that service 238 bus routes, 20 Select Bus Service routes, and 75 \nexpress bus routes throughout the five boroughs of New York City.  Id. ¶ 21.  Forty-three of these \nlines operate in Manhattan.   Id.  In 2023 alone, New York City buses served approximately 427 \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 69 of 80\nmillion riders and traveled a collective 152 million miles.   Id.  Without sufficient FHWA funds to \nmaintain the roadways on which MTA buses are driven, the MTA’s operations will necessarily \nsuffer.  If the condition of these roadways deteriorates due to funding constraints, it will inevitably \naffect the ability of MTA buses to meet their schedules, and likely contribute to deterioration of \nthe buses themselves, increasing expenses for the MTA to maintain or replace them.  Id. ¶ 30.   \nThe potential loss of all federal funding from the CMAQ program, but more importantly \nfor all future projects seeking federal funding through STIP amendments, and even the cutting off \nof funding to maintain the streets on which MTA buses operate, would each undeniably and \nirreparably harm the MTA’s ability to maintain an efficient transportation system that serves \nmillions of people every day and helps to power the economy of the New York metropolitan area.  \nStymying the MTA’s ability to perform its obligations to the public to provide safe, reliable and \naccessible  transportation  will undermine its credibility with the public.  City of Los Angeles v. \nSessions, 2018 WL 6071072, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2018) (forcing a city to contravene \n“longstanding policy” priorities and consequently “imped[e] … community relationships” and \n“diminish[] community trust” constituted irreparable harm).     \nThe alternative—choosing to bend to the coercive intent of the illegal termination of the \nVPPP Agreement and halt the Program pending resolution of this action—would similarly have \ndire and irreparable consequences.  Irreparable harm exists where, in reliance on the federal \ngovernment’s approval of a program, a State makes “substantial resource investments in planning \nfor the implementation of [that] program,” only to have that approval rescinded and the anticipated \nbenefits of those investments lost.  Texas v. Brooks-LaSure, 2021 WL 5154219, at *12 (E.D. Tex. \nAug. 20, 2021) (finding irreparable harm where, in reliance on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices’ final approval for Texas to implement demonstration program that diverged from default \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 70 of 80\nSocial Security Act requirements, Texas “made substantial resource investments in planning for \nimplementation of that program”).  Here, TBTA expended approximately $500 million in public \nfunds  to  prepare  for  the  Program’s  design,  construction,  implementation  operation,  and \nmaintenance, as well as on an information campaign to inform the public of the January 5, 2025 \nimplementation date.  C. de Cerreño Decl. ¶ 30.  “Few if any of these costs would have been \nincurred had USDOT/FHWA taken the position at the beginning of the long and torturous 5-year \nprocess it now takes—that the Program is not lawful under the VPPP because it utilizes cordon \npricing to raise money for mass transit.”  Id. ¶ 31.  These costs will continue to accrue even if \nTBTA is forced to cease tolling during the pendency of this lawsuit.  According to TBTA’s Chief \nOperating Officer, TBTA will continue to incur substantial costs of $12 million in additional \nexpenditures each month related to the operation and maintenance of the tolling system even if \ntolls are not collected.  Id. ¶ 33.   \nAt the same time, if the Program stops, the MTA and TBTA will not see the expected \nbenefits of their investment, including congestion reduction with its attendant benefits and revenue \ngeneration, and will instead lose money maintaining a temporarily defunct tolling system.  The \nMTA would stand to lose average monthly revenues of $50 million or more, which would delay \ncritical capital improvements to public transit, including adding accessibility to numerous subway \nstations consistent with the ADA, improving outdated subway signaling, enhancing safety and \ncustomer service, and extending public transit to under-served areas—not to mention delay relief \nfrom congestion in the CBD, alongside its concomitant economic and environmental costs.  Id. ¶¶ \n34-35.  The lost revenue could never be recouped, even if the Program is restarted, as those months \nof tolling would be lost forever.  Id. ¶ 34.  These expenses and loss of revenue would amount to a \npreventable loss of public resources, which the public has an interest in avoiding.  North Carolina, \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 71 of 80\n192 F. Supp. 3d at 629 (finding irreparable harm where unavailability of funds was “likely to have \nan immediate impact on [the state’s] ability to provide critical resources to the public, causing \ndamage that would persist regardless of whether funding [was] subsequently reinstated”).   \nIf federal funding typically received by the MTA becomes unavailable until the Court rules \non the legality of FHWA’s purported rescission of the VPPP Agreement, the “MTA would be \nforced  to  juggle  priorities  and  defer,  if  not  eliminate,  many  important  projects  (including \naccessibility projects) due to the lack of funding.”  Willens Decl. ¶ 31.  “The same would be true \nif the Project Sponsors capitulated and stopped tolling entries to the CBD, as MTA would have to \ndivert other capital funds to repay the almost $1.4 billion in congestion pricing-related debt that \nwould otherwise be used for important projects and could not issue bonds or finance projects that \nare already planned.”  Id.  “Some projects would undoubtedly not proceed at all or would be \nmaterially delayed, contributing to deterioration” of transit service “and delay of improvements to \naccess.”  Id.  The consequence of this “budgetary uncertainty” would irreparably harm the public \ntransit system, and thus the traveling public.  See City and County of San Francisco, 2025 WL \n1186310, at *2; New York, 2025 WL 715621, at *15.  The loss of public resources, and revocation \nof  revenues  used  to  secure  bonds  issued  by  Defendant  would  similarly  damage  Plaintiffs’ \nreputation and goodwill, an injury “not easily measured or fully compensable in damages.”  See \nRoss-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 1996) (loss of goodwill \nand reputation is a “kind of harm is often held to be irreparable”). \nIn addition, NYCDOT faces a host of potential harms that could seriously damage its \nability to undertake and complete projects, including projects that are critical for the safety of those \nwho work, live, and travel in the City.  Without advance construction authorizations, the local \nproject  sponsor  must  set  aside  the  full  amount  of  the  project’s  costs  without  hope  of \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 72 of 80\nreimbursement,  reducing  the  agency’s  flexibility  and  ability  to  progress  transportation \nprograms.  See Carry Decl. ¶ 8.  Similarly, FHWA’s refusal to approve STIP amendments would \nblock any new transportation projects from “entering the federal fund eligibility pipeline.”  Id. \n¶ 10.  And Defendants’ threatened actions could also stop current NYCDOT projects in their \ntracks.  Specifically, withholding NEPA approvals “would effectively halt projects in the pipeline \nwhere federal funding or approvals are necessary in order to undertake the anticipated work.”  Id. \n¶ 9.  In Manhattan, there are multiple ongoing or planned projects worth hundreds of millions of \ndollars that face imminent threat, including projects focused on improving roads, enhancing \npedestrian safety (including at least one project focused on safety around schools), and making \nutility and infrastructure upgrades.  Id. ¶¶ 13-15.  And if FHWA expands its threatened actions \nbeyond Manhattan to the rest of New York City, NYCDOT projects with a combined cost of over \n$3.1 billion will be at risk.  Id. ¶¶ 16-18.  Many of these projects are critical to ensuring the efficient \nand safe movement of people and goods throughout the City.  The statement in the April 21 Letter \nthat FHWA may exempt “Safety Projects” provides little solace.  Because FHWA will determine \nwhether a project qualifies; this uncertainty will seriously harm Plaintiffs’ and NYCDOT’s ability \nto plan and budget for the future.  Willens Decl. ¶ 24; Carry Decl. ¶ 11. \nFinally, and fundamentally, “[a]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating \nstatutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  Our \nWicked Lady LLC v. Cuomo, 2021 WL 915033, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2021) (quoting Maryland \nv. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers)); see also Washington v. Trump, \n2025 WL 509617, at *1 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 16, 2025) (“The rule of law is secured by a strong \npublic interest that the laws ‘enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat.’”) \n(quoting E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 779 (9th Cir. 2018)).  That, of course, \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 73 of 80\nis exactly what is happening here.  The federal government is trying to prevent New York from \nmaintaining a congestion pricing program that is mandated by State law, frustrating the intentions \nof the State’s legislative representatives and the public they serve.  By forcing the MTA and TBTA \n“to make an unreasonable choice, [FHWA’s order] results in a constitutional injury sufficient to \nestablish … irreparable harm.”  County of Santa Clara, 250 F. Supp. 3d at 538 (where plaintiffs \ndemonstrated that executive order was “unconstitutionally coercive” in violation of Tenth and \nFifth Amendment, they adequately demonstrated “a constitutional injury sufficient to establish a \nlikelihood of irreparable harm”) (citing Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012)).   \nIII.  A preliminary injunction would serve the public interest \n“Under the last injunction factor, courts must ‘balance the competing claims of injury and \nmust consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief,’ as \nwell as ‘the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.’”  Chan, \n2024 WL 5199945, at *48 (quoting Yang v. Kosinski, 960 F.3d 119, 135-36 (2d Cir. 2020)).  As \nnoted, these factors “merge” where the opposing party is the federal government.  New York, 969 \nF.3d at 59; Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  These two factors weigh heavily in favor of enjoining USDOT’s \nunlawful withholding of FHWA approvals, which will in all likelihood force the MTA to delay or \ncancel critical projects designed to improve public transit and make subway facilities accessible to \npeople with disabilities, and hinder the provision of acceptable bus service, along with a host of \nirreparable harm to motorists on State highways as described further in the brief of NYSDOT.  \nMoreover, Defendants’ aim of stopping the Program through retaliatory threats would result in the \nincrease of congestion and vehicular emissions and a loss of numerous other Program benefits.   \nFirst and foremost, there is “generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \nagency action.”  League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  “To the \ncontrary, there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 74 of 80\nlaws that govern their existence and operations.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); Make the \nRd. N.Y. v. Pompeo, 475 F. Supp. 3d 232, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (“[T]here is no public interest in \nallowing Defendants to proceed with unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious executive or agency \nactions that exceed their statutory authority.”); New York v. D.H.S., 408 F. Supp. 3d 334, 351 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2019), aff’d as modified, 969 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2020).  Defendants acted unlawfully in \npurporting to rescind the VPPP Agreement and then compounded that unlawful act by threatening \nto withhold federal approvals to coerce the State, the MTA and TBTA, and NYCDOT into obeying \nthe ultra vires April 21 Duffy Letter.  See supra at 21-51.  Here, the likelihood of success “is a \nstrong indicator that a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest.”  League of Women \nVoters, 838 F.3d at 12; see also Saget v. Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, 377 (E.D.N.Y. 2019).    \nMoreover, Defendants’ threat to withhold FHWA approvals is plainly not in the public \ninterest.  As explained above, the MTA uses funding requiring FHWA approvals for STIP \namendments for billions of dollars in federally funded work, as well as FHWA-administered \nfunding to meet the requirements of the CAA and ADA, including by making subway stations \nmore accessible.  Unsurprisingly, courts in similar circumstances have held that withholding \ngovernment funding earmarked for critical public projects does not serve the public interest.  New \nYork, 2025 WL 715621, at *15  (evidence that withheld federal funds would “endanger the States’ \nability  to  provide  vital  services,”  including  affecting  “critical  transportation  infrastructure” \nprojects, “overwhelmingly show[ed] that the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of \ngranting” preliminary injunction); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, at *19 (plaintiffs \n“more than met their burden” when freeze in federal spending “placed critical programs for \nchildren, the elderly, and everyone in between in serious jeopardy”); County of Santa Clara, 250 \n61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 75 of 80\nF. Supp. 3d at 539 (threat of withholding federal funds created “significant budget uncertainty” \nand “coercive effects” that weighed in favor of preliminary injunction).    \nHalting the Program in response to such threats also “would impair the public interest in \nlessening both congestion and the extreme financial costs it imposes.”  Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, \nat *49.  Indeed, evidence from the Program’s initial months of implementation shows that it is \nworking.  “Traffic in the CBD has decreased substantially, with approximately 5.8 million fewer \nvehicles entering the district in January through March 2025 than would be expected based on data \nfor prior years.”  C. de Cerreño Decl. ¶ 25(a).  This represents an 8% to 13% reduction from a \ntypical January, February, and March.  Id.  New data indicates that traffic in the CBD was down \nby 12% in April.  Id.  This reduction in congestion has a logical corollary benefit of less vehicular \nemission and reduced time for emergency vehicle trips and for buses.   \nIndeed, travel times have also improved.  In January, crossing times were 12% faster at the \nLincoln Tunnel and 45% faster at the Holland Tunnel; trip times from Brooklyn and Queens fell \nbetween 10-30% in January compared to January 2024.  Id. ¶ 25(c).  A recent independent study \nfound a 15% improvement in CBD traffic speeds.  Id. ¶ 25(h).  Trips are also more reliable.  Traffic \nthrough the Holland Tunnel used to be delayed more than 3 minutes on 54% of weekdays—that \nhas fallen now to 12%.  Id. ¶ 25(g).  “On the Williamsburg Bridge, delays used to be greater than \n3 minutes 65% of the time; the Program has reduced that to 2%.”  Id.    \nPublic services have also improved.  “[B]us routes have seen significant decreases in the \ntime needed to complete their routes.”  Id. ¶ 25(i).  “[T]here are 23% fewer customer trips on \nexpress buses that are delayed 10 minutes or more,” and “[e]xpress buses are traveling 21% faster \non the portion of their routes leading into and within the CBD.”  Id.  In addition, “[f]ewer vehicles \nutilize the nine MTA bridges and tunnels, with levels dropping 2.4% from March of 2024 to March \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 76 of 80\nof 2025.”  Id. ¶ 25(f).  “The largest reductions are at the Hugh L. Carey and Queens-Midtown \nTunnels, which lead directly into the [CBD],” and “[t]ruck traffic traveling through these tunnels \ndropped 14% this year compared to the same period in 2024.”  Id.     \nThe loss of substantial public benefits—either critical federal funding or the substantial \nbenefits of the Program—weighs heavily in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief.  See \nChan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *48 (noting the Program was “predicted to reduce congestion thereby \nimproving regional air quality, providing safety benefits, improving worker productivity, reducing \nnoise pollution, among other benefits”); see also Brooks-LaSure, 2021 WL 5154219, at *12  \n(granting  preliminary  injunction  to  block  federal  agency’s  rescission  of  previously  granted \napproval where rescission threatened to “decrease . . . the number of healthcare providers and the \nquality of care”); cf. Cascadia Wildlands v. Thrailkill, 49 F. Supp. 3d 774, 778 (D. Or. 2014), aff’d, \n806 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir. 2015) (“public’s interest in the economic and environmental benefits of \nthe project including providing jobs and retaining infrastructure for them” weighed against \ngranting preliminary injunction to block forest project).    \nAs this Court previously recognized, there is a compelling public interest in avoiding the \nunnecessary costs that TBTA would incur if it were required to pay continued operating costs \nduring a pause to avoid yet additional costs of stopping and starting the Program.  Chan, 2024 WL \n5199945, at *49.  Indeed, the public has a clear interest in avoiding the loss of public funds and \nthe substantial benefits those funds would achieve.  See, e.g., Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d \n267, 297 (W.D. La. 2022) (public interest favored permanently enjoining pause on new oil and gas \nleases on federal lands where “[l]local government funding, jobs for Plaintiff States’ workers, and \nfunds for the restoration of Louisiana’s Coastline are at stake”); Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, \n63 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 77 of 80\n951 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1115 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (“economic health of communities and industries ... \nis an important element of the public interest that must be considered in balancing the equities.”). \nStopping the Program would also mean a return to the crippling congestion that has long \nplagued  Manhattan  and  resulted  in  extraordinary  costs  to  the  metropolitan  region’s  public.  \n“Numerous studies have established that the congestion addressed by the [Program] itself, if \nunchecked …, will also continue to impose tremendous costs on individuals and businesses \nthroughout the New York metropolitan region.”  Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *49.  Congestion \n“has a $20 billion annual cost, including more than $9 billion in travel-time costs and nearly $6 \nbillion in industry revenue losses.”  Id. (citation omitted).  This includes “$1,900 annually for \nManhattan Workers and $767 per worker for the New York City metropolitan region.”  Id.  Yet \nDefendants would force the public to return to the days of costly and polluting congestion or accept \ndevastating losses in federal funding.  Clearly, such a choice is not in the public interest.  \nIn contrast, Defendants can demonstrate no public interest in a cessation of tolling while \nthis action is litigated.  Indeed, they have demonstrated that stopping the tolling is not an urgent \nmatter, by extending the “deadline” to do so twice.  The pretextual macro-economic concerns \nraised by Duffy and President Trump—which FHWA’s own NEPA analysis predicted would not \noccur—have indeed failed to materialize.  In fact, the opposite has happened.  “Pedestrian traffic \nin Manhattan increased 4.6% between January 5 (the day that toll collection began) and January \n31 compared to the same period in 2024.”  C. de Cerreño Decl. ¶ 26(a).   The gross revenue of \nBroadway shows during January–March 2025 was 25% higher than the same period last year, and \nattendance was up 20% for January–March of 2025 as compared to the same period last year.  Id. \n¶ 26(c).  Hotel occupancy in January was up 3% year over year, and “[r]etail sales were up 1.5% \nin January and February—on track to be $900 million higher this year than last.”  Id. ¶ 26(b), (d).  \n64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 78 of 80\n“Leasing in the CBD was up 11% this January versus the fourth quarter of 2024, and up 80% since \nthe first quarter of last year.”  Id. ¶ 26(f).  There has been less diversion of traffic to outer boroughs \n(including environmental justice communities) than initially feared.  Id. ¶ 25(m).  Indeed, a recent \nstudy published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, with lead authors from Yale and \nStanford Universities, confirmed that the Program has benefited areas outside of the CBD as well, \nwith highways and major roadways also seeing sustained speed improvements.  Id. ¶ 25(m).  \nThe only “public” interest Defendants can cite to support the cessation of tolling is either \navoiding the cost of the toll to individual drivers or “[]respect” for the federal government.  See \nTrice Decl., Ex. 7.  The first is highly ironic given FHWA’s previous determination that the \nProgram’s forecast (and now demonstrated) congestion reduction effect outweighed individual \ndrivers’ interest in a lower cost journey to the CBD, and as noted the Program includes discounted \ntolls for low-income drivers.  This Court has also so found, in denying all of the previous motions \nto block the Program’s implementation.  Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *48-49.  As for the second, \nwe are aware of no authority that supports a public interest in permitting the federal Executive to \ndemand compliance from State and local agencies, even as litigation remains pending.  Under our \nsystem of dual sovereignty, it is the province of the Judiciary, and not the Executive, to police the \nrespective powers and obligations of the federal government. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons provided herein, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. \n   \n65 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 83     Filed 05/05/25     Page 79 of 80\nDated: May 5, 2025    Respectfully submitted, \nNew York, New York \n /s/ Roberta A.

Duffy, No. 25 Civ. 1413 (S.D.N.Y.) \n \nDear Erin: \n \nWe write with respect to the above-referenced litigation brought by the Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority (“MTA”) against the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), U.S. \nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), and \nExecutive Director of the FHWA, Gloria Shepherd, to provide you with information concerning \n(1) the litigation risk that DOT faces in defending the Secretary’s February 19, 2025 decision to \nterminate the New York City Central Business District Tolling Program (“CBDTP”) agreement, \nand (2) a process for terminating the CBDTP agreement outside of the current litigation for DOT \nto consider.   \nAs discussed below, there is considerable litigation risk in defending the Secretary’s \nFebruary 19, 2025 decision against plaintiffs’ claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, that \nthe decision was contrary to law, pretextual, procedurally arbitrary and capricious, and violated \ndue process. For the reasons outlined below, it is unlikely that Judge Liman or further courts of \nreview will accept the argument that the CBDTP was not a statutorily authorized “value pricing” \npilot under the Value Pricing Pilot Program (“VPPP”). \nFHWA may, however, be able to properly terminate the CBDTP value pricing pilot \npursuant to established Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) regulations concerning the \ntermination of cooperative agreements. Termination of the CBDTP agreement pursuant to these \nOMB regulations would still allow FHWA to end the CBDTP for the Secretary’s stated reasons, \nbut would do so as a matter of changed agency priorities rather than arguing the CBDTP was not \nstatutorily authorized in the first instance. Importantly, DOT can seek termination of the agreement \npursuant to the OMB regulations in addition to, and not in place of, defending the rationale laid \nout in the Secretary’s letter. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 2 of 11\n  Page 2 \n \n \nI.   The Court Is Unlikely To Uphold FHWA’s Stated Rationale for Terminating the CBDTP \nAgreement \nThe Secretary provides two reasons why the CBDTP is not an eligible pilot project under \nthe VPPP statutory language: (1) the program constitutes impermissible “cordon pricing,” which \nis not authorized because it does not offer a toll-free option, and (2) the level of CBDTP tolls has \nbeen set primarily by the need to raise revenues rather than prevent congestion. Neither of these \nreasons is likely to convince the Court:  \nFirst, with respect to the rationale that “cordon pricing” is not authorized under the phrase \n“congestion pricing” or “value pricing,” we have been unable to identify a compelling legal \nargument to support this position. As you are aware, the legislation that enacted the VPPP, Section \n1012(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), Pub. L. 102-240 (1991) \n(23 U.S.C. § 149 note), as amended by Section 1216(a) of the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st  Century  (TEA-21),  Pub.  L.  105-178  (1998)  (when  the  term  “value  pricing”  replaced \n“congestion pricing” in 1998, the two terms were used synonymously), and Section 1604(a) of the \nSafe Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-\nLU), Pub. L. 109-59 (2005), does not define “value pricing.” Under Loper Bright Enterprises v. \nRaimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), the Court will not afford the Secretary’s current interpretation \nany deference, and will engage in its own interpretation of whether cordon pricing is included \nwithin the term value pricing. The factors that the court will look at in making this decision point \ntowards the conclusion that the type of cordon pricing utilized in the CBDTP is included within \nthe terms “congestion pricing” or “value pricing.” \nAt the outset, the term “congestion pricing” is not defined in the statute, is admittedly \nbroad, and has no ordinary, plain meaning. Instead, it is a “term of art” that has technical meaning \nwithin the realm of transportation and under the ISTEA. The main argument for reading the term \n“congestion pricing” narrowly is that the VPPP provides an exemption to the longstanding bar on \ntolling on federal-aid highways imposed by 23 U.S.C. § 301, for congestion pricing projects. \nSee, e.g., Cir. City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 118 (2001)  (“narrow construction” of \nexemption to FAA warranted by reference “to the statutory context in which it is found and in \nmanner consistent with the FAA’s purpose”). However, this “narrow construction” argument is \nundercut by more recent Supreme Court opinions that have moved away from this canon of \nstatutory interpretation. See, e.g., Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 584 U.S. 79, 89 (2018) \n(interpreting exemptions to the FLSA, and noting that the Court has “no license to give the \nexemption anything but a fair reading”); Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. 427, \n439 (2019) (interpreting FOIA exemptions, and noting that “just as we cannot properly expand [an \nexemption] beyond what its terms permit, we cannot arbitrarily constrict it either by adding \nlimitations found nowhere in its terms” (cleaned up)). \nMoreover,  the  explicit  statutory  purpose  of  the  ISTEA  supports  the  argument  that \n“congestion pricing” should be read broadly, allowing states to develop flexible traffic solutions \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 3 of 11\n  Page 3 \n \n \n“with particular attention to the external benefits of . . . reduced traffic congestion,” and “with \ninsistent attention to the concepts of innovation.” ISTEA, § 2, 105 Stat 191.1 Indeed, Judge Liman \nhas already held that the VPPP was founded on the “theory” that states and localities would try \n“novel social and economic experiments,” such as the CBDTP. Chan v. U.S. DOT, No. 23 Civ. \n10365 (LJL), 2024 WL 5199945, at *24 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2024); see also id. at *34 (“Congress \nhas expressly signaled its support for tolled projects aimed at mitigating congestion such as the \nTolling Program.”). Based on the foregoing, it is unlikely the Court would conclude that a zone-\nbased or area-wide pricing system—i.e., cordon pricing—is not the type of “innovative” pilot \nprogram included in the undefined and broad term “congestion pricing.” Cf. Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. \nYeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not \nexpressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.” \n(cleaned up)). As a result, it is unlikely that courts will narrowly construe the term “congestion \npricing” to exclude cordon pricing projects based on the longstanding prohibition on tolling alone. \nWhile  we  would  argue  that  “excerpts  from  committee  hearings  and  scattered  floor \nstatements by individual lawmakers” are generally considered “among the least illuminating forms \nof legislative history,” Advoc. Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.S. 468, 481  (2017), in this \ninstance, there is little else that sheds light on the meaning of the term “congestion pricing.” And \nthe  legislative  history  concerning  “congestion  pricing”  provides  evidence  of  its  “technical \nmeaning” at the time, as well as the historical background of the term’s breadth. In this instance, \nthe “clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate [the] ambiguous text,” especially in the \ntechnical area of transportation projects. Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 572 (2011); see \nalso, e.g., Van Buren v. United States, 593 U.S. 374, 388 (2021) (concluding that the statutory term \n“access” has a long-standing “technical meaning” “[i]n the computing context”). That legislative \nhistory makes clear that when the ISTEA was passed in 1991 the term “congestion pricing,” was \nunderstood by its drafters to simply mean “a system of charging for highway or bridge user-tolls \nbased on peak hour travel demand.” S. Comm. on Env’t and Pub. Works, S. Hr’g 102-37, \nCongestion Pricing and Infrastructure Financing at 5 (Mar. 21, 1991) (Opening Statement of \nSenator John W. Warner). Among the examples of “congestion pricing” that were discussed was \n \n1 Its drafters similarly understood that the ISTEA allowed states and localities “to adopt flexible \nsolutions to deal with congestion” including “aggressive programs to better manage transportation \ndemands.” 137 Cong. Rec. S7453-01, S7454, 1991 WL 99693, at *2; see also 137 Cong. Rec. \nS7412-01, S7416, 1991 WL 99676, at *9 (“This bill gives the States a tremendous amount of \nflexibility. … those States and cities that choose to construct new, innovative transportation or \nmanagement systems can serve as models for other States and cities.”); S. Conf. Rep. at 23, 137 \nCong. Rec. S18581-01, S18591, 1991 WL 252477 (“Other innovative programs including a \ncongestion pricing pilot program …”); Statement of President George Bush Upon Signing the \nISTEA, 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1865, 1865 (“Another major element of our proposal was to provide \nState and local officials unprecedented flexibility.”). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 4 of 11\n  Page 4 \n \n \nSingapore, which since 1975 had required a sticker “to enter the central areas during morning rush \nhours,” id. at 7-8 (Testimony of Steven A. Morrison)—a situation where tolls are inescapable.2 In \nlight of this legislative history, it is unlikely that the Court will agree that the term “congestion \npricing” must be read narrowly. \nAlthough DOT’s interpretation of the statutory language “cannot bind a court,” a court may \nstill look to “the longstanding practice of the government—like any other interpretive aid—[to] \n \n2 Additional testimony from subject matter experts concerning congestion pricing before the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee, the Senate committee which reported out the \nISTEA, also explicitly reference this type of congestion pricing and nascent plans to test such \nprograms. Id. at 13-17 (discussing cordon pricing in Singapore, Hong Kong, Stockholm, and plans \nfor a “test program in congestion pricing” in Southern California); id. at 25 (discussing cordon \npricing project in Netherlands, and noting “peak pricing in transportation is not new … you pay \nhigher parking fees in cities in central business districts during the peak hours”); id. at 44-45 \n(“Congestion pricing has been tried in Singapore and in Hong Kong … It is perhaps premature to \nsuggest that congestion pricing be introduced en masse, but it is time for some well developed, \nvisible experiments to guide policy makers toward the next step.”); id. at 86 (“Charging motorists \na tax or user fee when they drive their cars into the central business district during peak commuting \nhours is another method to employ peak pricing.”).  \nOther DOT and FHWA documents that pre-date the passage of the ISTEA show that the term \n“congestion pricing” was understood as allowing for flexible zone-based pricing. The Secretary of \nTransportation’s February 1990 report “Moving America,” which preceded the passage of ISTEA \nand is referenced in the legislative history, similarly refers to “congestion pricing” or “peak-period \npricing” as instituting “relatively higher prices for travel during periods of peak demand and lower \nprices  in  off-peak  periods.”  Moving  America  Report  at  48,  available  at \nhttps://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112097068693&seq=14.  The  report  similarly \nespouses giving states and localities flexibility to institute congestion pricing. Id. (“We also need \nto  give  greater  attention  to  the  potential  for  capacity-enhancing  pricing  techniques  in \ntransportation, such as peak-period, or congestion pricing, and to refine them and extend their \nuse.”); see also id. at 4 (“In urban and intercity travel, Department programs will encourage system \nmanagement improvements, peak-period pricing, and other initiatives to reduce congestion.”); at \n49 (“It is Federal transportation policy to … encourage peak-period or congestion pricing to ensure \nthe most effective use of transportation facilities.”): id. at 122 (DOT’s policy is to “[e]ncourage \npricing and other transportation management techniques for all modes where there is system \ncongestion”). Moreover, DOT’s March 1990 National Transportation Strategic Planning Study \nlists the “Singapore licensing scheme that charges fees for vehicles to enter the downtown center” \nas one “innovative idea[] … that may be of interest to the United States.” See pg. 6-14, available \nat https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015075326614&seq=172. Neither report suggests \nthat toll-free options for access should be a required element of a congestion pricing program. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 5 of 11\n  Page 5 \n \n \ninform a court’s determination of ‘what the law is,’” Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 386, and “factual \npremises  within  the  agency’s  expertise,”  can  be  “especially  informative”  of  the  Court’s \ninterpretation. Id.at 402. Here, that means that the FHWA’s lengthy history of including “area wide \npricing” or “cordon pricing” as a proper “congestion pricing” or “value pricing” strategy will \ninform the court’s interpretation.  While we would point to the FHWA’s own statements that the \nCBDTP “is an area-wide congestion pricing system, which is unprecedented in the VPPP and such \ntype [of] system has not yet been implemented in the U.S.” (Oct. 24, 2019 letter from FHWA to \nNYS DOT), there are numerous examples of FHWA interpreting “congestion pricing” to include \nsuch area-wide or cordon pricing projects, including the following:  \n•  The  FHWA’s  solicitation  of  VPPP  applications  that  followed  SAFETEA-LU’s \nreauthorization  of  VPPP  in  2005,  notes:  “Applications  of  value  pricing  which  are \ncomprehensive and include pricing of currently free facilities, such as area wide pricing,” \nare  projects  of  interest  that  squarely  fall  within  the  term  “value  pricing  project.” \nSAFETEA-LU, Value Pricing Pilot Program Participation, 71 FR 970-01 (Jan. 6, 2006). \nThe FHWA’s solicitation of VPPP applications in its 2007 notice explicitly identifies \n“cordon pricing” as an eligible, and preferred, value pricing project. See Value Pricing Pilot \nProgram Participation, Fiscal Years 2007-2009, 71 FR 77084-02 (Dec. 22, 2006) (“Unlike \nprevious  VPP  program  solicitation  notices  which  sought  a  wide  variety  of  project \napplications, the FHWA is now only seeking projects to study or implement pricing that is \nbroad in nature and will no longer entertain applications for studying or implementing \nsingle-facility projects. Such applications should cover a significantly-sized geographical \narea and include multiple roadway facilities that are priced, an interconnected managed \nlane network, or cordon pricing, where, as in London, cars are charged a substantial fee \nto drive in a congested area on weekdays. (emphasis added); Value Pricing Pilot Program \nParticipation, Fiscal Year 2009, 73 FR 53478-01 (Sep. 16, 2008) (similar).   \n•  FHWA’s Reports to Congress also discuss, among other types of programs, “cordon \npricing” as a viable project under the VPPP. A 2009 FHWA Report on VPPP explicitly \nnotes that the types of congestion pricing projects such as the CBDTP must be included in \nthe VPPP. “To achieve its stated objectives, the VPPP portfolio of implemented projects \nmust  include  pilot  implementations  of  broad  congestion  pricing  projects  –  projects \ninvolving tolls on all lanes of a highway facility, all roads in a congested area, or all roads \nof an entire roadway network. Such approaches tend to take away the choice to drive alone \nfor free in congested traffic.” FHWA, Report On The Value Pricing Pilot Program Through \nMay  2009,  at  iii,  2  (Sep.  17,  2009)  (emphasis  in  original),  available  at  \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/\nvppp09rpt.pdf. \n•  In addition, the assertion in the Secretary’s letter that “FHWA has never before approved a \nVPPP program that uses cordon pricing or that does not provide a toll-free option,” is not \nentirely correct. While it is true that implementation of an actual cordon/area-wide pricing \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 6 of 11\n  Page 6 \n \n \npilot had not been approved by the FHWA prior to the CBDTP, similar cordon pricing \nprojects have been approved under the VPPP. See U.S. Transportation Secretary Mineta \nAnnounces $56.3 Million For States In Highway Discretionary Funds, FHWA 31-02, 2002 \nWL 1487104 (FHWA’s approval of funding for a “Value Pricing Pilot, Cordon pricing in \nFort Myers Beach, $500,000””). And VPPP funding has been approved for studying \ncordon/area-wide pricing in Southern California, that would not include a toll-free option. \nSee FHWA, Report on the Value Pricing Pilot Program Through April 2018, at 12-13, \navailable at \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/\nvppp18rpt.pdf  (funding  amount  $916,802).  In  their  intervenor  complaint,  the  NYS \nDepartment of Transportation has cited this 2018 FHWA Report that refers to the VPPP-\nfunded study concerning implementing a “cordon/areawide pricing pilot” in California, as \nwell as a 2013 FHWA primer on congestion pricing that refers to “zone-based (area or \ncordon) charges” as a main type of congestion pricing strategy, see FHWA, Congestion \nPricing:  A  Primer  on  Institutional  Issues  at  3  (Apr.  2013), \nhttps://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/26194/dot_26194_DS1.pdf.  \nThe Secretary’s letter further asserts that “cordon pricing” in this context is impermissible \nbecause it (unlike other congestion pricing strategies) does not provide a toll-free option.  The \nletter argues that 23 U.S.C. § 129(d)(4)(B), which contains a “congestion relief program” for \nFederal Aid Highways and specifically identifies “cordon pricing” as one of the “eligible projects,” \nis the basis for this argument because it only applies to the “Interstate System where drivers can \nchoose a non-Interstate route.” However, the provision at 23 U.S.C. § 129(d)(4)(B) was added in \n2021, pursuant to Section 11404 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. 117-58 \n(2021), and thus this contextual argument does not provide compelling evidence concerning the \nmeaning of the term “congesting pricing” (or “value pricing”) as used in the ISTEA. Furthermore, \nwe have not identified a provision that requires there to be a non-Interstate route to a particular \nlocation, or a requirement that that route not be tolled (presumably if the route is not part of the \nfederal highway system and not constructed with federal funds, the states would be making the \ndecision about whether it is tolled). As outlined above, the legislative history and FHWA’s prior \nguidance implementing the VPPP undercut this assertion. \nFinally, the Secretary’s letter refers to arguments made by the Town of Hempstead in \nlitigation currently pending (but stayed) against FHWA and the MTA in Eastern District of New \nYork. See Town of Hempstead v. DOT, No. 24 Civ. 3263 (E.D.N.Y.). There the Town of Hempstead \nargued (in its Complaint at ¶¶ 63-71) that the major questions doctrine prevents the VPPP statutory \nlanguage from being read expansively to include the type of cordon pricing used in the CBDTP. It \nis very unlikely that Judge Liman or any court of review would agree with that assertion. The \nmajor questions doctrine, as outlined by the Supreme Court, is limited to situations where agencies \nseek to uphold “unheralded regulatory power over a significant portion of the American economy.” \nW. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 722 (2022) (cleaned up); id. at 724 (the doctrine applies to \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 7 of 11\n  Page 7 \n \n \n“assertions of extravagant statutory power over the national economy”); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 \nU.S. 477, 504 (2023) (“A decision of such magnitude and consequence [on a matter of] earnest \nand profound debate across the country must rest with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant \nto a clear delegation.” (cleaned up)). The imposition of cordon pricing in the central business \ndistrict, in a portion of Manhattan, does not have the requisite wide-ranging effects on the national \neconomy. Moreover, this is not a case where the FHWA has “conveniently enabled [itself] to enact \na program that Congress has chosen not to enact itself.” Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 503 (cleaned up). \nHere, Congress explicitly included in the VPPP the ability of states and localities to enter into \ncooperative  agreements  with  FHWA  in  connection  with  value  pricing  pilots  and  explicitly \nexempted them from the general prohibition on the use of tolls on federal-aid highways. Finally, \nthere are other equities in making this “major questions” argument—including that it necessarily \nserves to curtail executive power—that would counsel against making such an argument in defense \nof the Secretary’s letter. \nSecond, with respect to the argument that the CBDTP is not authorized because the “VPPP \ndoes not authorize tolls that are based on considerations separate from reducing congestion or \nadvancing  other  road-related  goals,”  there  are  two  impediments  to  this  argument  being \nsuccessful. At the outset, as a factual matter, FHWA has already publicly taken the position that a \ngoal of the CBDTP is reducing congestion in the CBP. In our filings before Judge Liman (as well \nas in the NEPA documents), the Government has repeatedly stated that the goals of the CBDTP \nare two-fold, reducing traffic congestion within the CBD and funding capital projects, see, e.g., \nApr. 1, 2024 Gov’t SJ Brief in Chan at 6, 9 (quoting final environmental assessment (“EA”)); see \nalso Chan, 2024 WL 5199945, at *33 (“[T]he Tolling Program in fact has two aims: to reduce \ncongestion and to generate revenue.”). The EA, and the Reevaluation documents, both support the \nconclusion that the tolls set will decrease congestion in the CBD. As a legal matter, there is nothing \nin the statute that prohibits a VPPP program from having a two-fold goal, limits how tolls are to \nbe set, or sets forth the amount of congestion reduction that is to be achieved. Moreover, the VPPP \nat Section 3 provides that “revenues generated by a pilot project” be applied to “projects eligible \nunder [Title 23 of the U.S.C.],” and the legislative history contains discussions about tolls from \ncongestion pricing projects being used to fund such eligible transit improvements (which is exactly \nwhat MTA intends to do here).3 This appears to be less of an argument supporting the assertion \nthat the CBDTP agreement was never lawful, but more of an argument that DOT has reconsidered \nits decision to accept the CBDTP into the VPPP program based on changed agency priorities.   \n \n3 The Court has previously found that revenues raised by the CBDTP tolls that are directed towards \neligible  transit  improvements  will  also  effectively  reduce  congestion.  See  Chan,  2024  WL \n5199945, at *26 (“The evidence before the Court is that investments in transit will “reduce vehicle \ndemand for road capacity in and connecting to the Manhattan CBD,” in turn leading to travel-time \nsavings  improvements,  travel-time  reliability  improvements,  and  safety  benefits  for  drivers \n(among others).” (citing final EA)). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 8 of 11\n  Page 8 \n \n \n     It is very unlikely that Judge Liman or further courts of review will uphold the Secretary’s \ndecision on the legal grounds articulated in the letter. Defending the case on this basis, with the \nmost likely outcome being vacatur of the Secretary’s decision or remand to the agency for further \nadministrative process, will only serve to delay FHWA’s elimination of the CBDTP. The agency \nwill  have  to  answer  the  MTA’s  and  intervenors’  complaints,  compile  and  produce  the \nadministrative record, and then the parties will engage in briefing, likely oral argument, and await \na decision from Judge Liman—which is exceedingly likely to be averse to the agency.  \nMoreover, based on a preliminary review of the documents provided for inclusion in the \nadministrative record, it appears that other than the Secretary’s decision itself, there is no other \nmaterial supporting or explaining the DOT’s change of position with respect to the two points \nidentified above that would not be subject to deliberative process or attorney-client privileges. The \nthin administrative record may lead plaintiffs to point to these “gaps” in the administrative record \nas justification for extra-record discovery from DOT, including requests for production of emails \nand  depositions  of  agency  officials,  including  the  Secretary  in  particular.  Indeed,  during \npreliminary conversations concerning scheduling in this matter, the MTA and other intervenor-\nplaintiffs have indicated they will likely seek extra-record discovery on this basis. While we would \nstrongly contest any request for extra-record discovery, it is always a possibility in cases where \nthere is very little written justification for an agency’s action. \nII.   FHWA Could Pursue Termination Through Established OMB Procedures \nWhile there is considerable litigation risk in defending the decision to terminate the \nCBDTP based on the argument that it is not a statutorily authorized “value pricing” pilot under the \nVPPP, FHWA may be able to accomplish the same goal, for the same reasons, utilizing established \nOMB procedures for the termination of cooperative agreements. \nOne option would be to seek termination of the CBDTP agreement pursuant to OMB \nregulations at 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339(c), 340(a)(4), because the cooperative agreement “no longer \neffectuates … agency priorities.” The relevant OMB regulation at 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) \n(adopted by DOT at 2 C.F.R. Part 1201) provides that federal awards (including cooperative \nagreements) may be terminated “by the federal agency… pursuant to the terms and conditions of \nthe Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities.” Moreover, the MTA, NYS DOT, and NYC DOT have already \nargued in their complaints that FHWA should have utilized the OMB regulations at 2 C.F.R. §§ \n200.340-342, if it wanted to end the CBDTP. See MTA Compl. ¶¶ 141-146; NYS DOT Compl. ¶¶ \n47-50; NYC DOT Compl. ¶¶ 118-123. Utilizing the OMB termination procedures would thus \ninsulate FHWA from plaintiffs’ arguments that they were not provided due process or that the \ntermination was procedurally arbitrary and capricious.  \nDOT has noted that the CBDTP agreement between the MTA and FHWA does not appear \nto fit within the regulatory definition of a “cooperative agreement” because there is no explicit \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 9 of 11\n  Page 9 \n \n \n“financial assistance” provided by the FHWA pursuant to the Agreement. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.1 \n(definition of cooperative agreement) (“[A] legal instrument of financial assistance between a \nFederal agency and a recipient …”). However, the definition of “assistance” is broadly defined by \nthe relevant statute to refer to “the transfer of anything of value for a public purpose of support or \nstimulation authorized by a law of the United States.” 31 U.S.C. § 6101(3). And the term \n“cooperative agreement,” as defined by statute, does not require an actual transfer of funds from \nan agency to a recipient. See 31 U.S.C. § 6305 (“An executive agency shall use a cooperative \nagreement as the legal instrument reflecting a relationship between the United States Government \nand a State, a local government, or other recipient when—(1) the principal purpose of the \nrelationship is to transfer a thing of value to the State, local government, or other recipient to carry \nout a public purpose of support …”). The term “cooperative agreement,” as used in the OMB \nregulations, also tracks this broad definition—noting a cooperative agreement is a legal instrument \n“used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer anything of value to \ncarry out a public purpose authorized by a law of the United States.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.1 (definition \nof Cooperative agreement, subsection (1)). Here, FHWA’s grant of authority to the MTA to apply \ntolls on federal-aid highways is clearly a transfer of a thing of value, and thus it appears the CBDTP \nagreement would properly be a cooperative agreement under the regulations. Moreover, the VPPP \nstatute explicitly refers to agreements between FHWA and states and localities as “cooperative \nagreements.” 23 U.S.C. § 149 note (“The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with as \nmany as 15 such State or local governments or public authorities to establish, maintain, and \nmonitor value pricing programs.”). Finally, the FHWA has noted that VPPP agreements that \nrequire tolling authority are still “cooperative agreements” even without the grant of actual funds. \nSee  Congestion  Pricing,  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program,  FHWA  (May  17,  2024), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing (“The Moving Ahead for Progress in the \n21st Century (MAP-21) Act did not authorize additional funds after FY2012 for the discretionary \ngrant component of the Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP). However, FHWA’s ability to enter \ninto cooperative agreements for projects that require tolling authority under this program for their \nimplementation will continue.”). \nThe CBDTP agreement does not have any explicit termination provisions, which may make \nthis argument more difficult. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b) (“The Federal agency or pass-through \nentity  must  clearly  and  unambiguously  specify  all  termination  provisions  in  the  terms  and \nconditions of the Federal award.”). The agreement does, however, reference “all Federal law and \nrequirements applicable to the project,” so if there are other DOT or FHWA regulations that pertain \nto termination of cooperative agreements, they would be incorporated by reference. This is similar \nto the argument made for termination of grants in U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops v. State, \n2025 WL 763738 (Mar. 11, 2025) and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL \n752378 (Mar. 10, 2025); however, those cases involve State Department grants which specifically \nreference State Department “Standard Terms and Conditions for Federal Awards” which permit \ntermination “if the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” If the \nFHWA or DOT have similar provisions for contract awards, even in sub-regulatory guidance or \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 10 of 11\n  Page 10 \n \n \npolicy, it would strengthen this argument.4 Even if FHWA cannot point to explicit termination \nprovisions that are incorporated within the CBDTP agreement, it is plain that the “pilot project” \nagreement can be terminated at some point by FHWA. Moreover, as noted, the MTA, NYS DOT, \nand NYC DOT have argued in their complaints that the CBDTP agreement is a “cooperative \nagreement,” and can only be terminated pursuant to the OMB regulations. Accordingly, we believe \nthe FHWA could successfully invoke these provisions and seek termination of the CBDTP \nagreement as “no longer effectuat[ing] … agency priorities,” even in the absence of explicit \ntermination provisions. \nTermination of the CBDTP agreement utilizing the OMB procedures would still allow \nFHWA to argue that the program should be terminated for the reasons outlined in the Secretary’s \nletter—i.e., (1) the CBDTP does not offer a toll-free option, and (2) the level of tolls has been set \nprimarily by the need to raise revenues rather than prevent congestion—except not as a matter of \nstatutory construction, but rather as a matter of changed agency priorities. Under the change-in-\nposition doctrine, “[a]gencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a \nreasoned explanation for the change,” “‘display awareness that [they are] changing position,’” and \nconsider “‘serious reliance interests.’” FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments, LLC, --- U.S. -\n--, 2025 WL 978101, at *13 (Apr. 2, 2025) (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U. S. \n211, 221-22 (2016)). There is ample precedent for FHWA changing its agency priorities with \nrespect to the types of VPPP projects which are solicited and approved by FHWA. See, e.g., \nSAFETEA-LU, Value Pricing Pilot Program Participation, 71 FR 40578-01 (July 17, 2006) \n(announcing delay in consideration of VPPP applications “to allow the FHWA to revise the VPP \nprogram guidance to solicit certain types of projects that further the goals of the Secretary of \nTransportation’s  new  National  Strategy  to  Reduce  Congestion  on America’s  Transportation \nNetwork, announced on May 16, 2006. This national strategy contains a number of elements that \ninvolve pricing, and thus a reconsideration of the types of projects that are being solicited for VPP \nprogram participation is warranted to ensure consistency with the national strategy.”).  \nMoreover, FHWA does not need to abandon the Secretary’s stated rationale—that the \nCBDTP is not a statutorily authorized VPPP project—altogether. Rather, FHWA can follow this \ntermination process in addition to defending the Secretary’s letter, and as an alternative, more-\ndefensible ground. To the extent FHWA decides to issue letters concerning MTA’s non-compliance \nafter the April 20th deadline, it may include in those letters a formal “notice of termination” of the \nCBDTP agreement. Such letter(s) should include an explanation that, in the alternative, the FHWA \nhas decided to change the types of VPPP projects it decides to prioritize or exclude (such as \nCBDTP) going forward, should be supported by a “reasoned explanation” in light of FHWA’s \nprevious pronouncements as to what will constitute acceptable VPPP applications, “display \n \n4 It appears that Section 16 of the  FHWA’s Contractors & Recipients General  Terms  and \nConditions  for  Assistance  Awards  may  be  one  such  applicable  provision.  See \nhttps://www.fhwa.dot.gov/cfo/contractor_recip/gtandc_generaltermsconditions.cfm.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 65     Filed 04/23/25     Page 11 of 11\n  Page 11 \n \n \nawareness” that FHWA is “changing position,” and “consider the serious reliance interests,” \nattendant with the buildout of the tolling infrastructure of the CBDTP—building on these same \nelements that are already included in the Secretary’s letter. In addition, if FHWA determines that \nnon-compliance cannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions, see 2 C.F.R. § 200.339 \n(referencing 2 C.F.R. § 200.208), it should follow all applicable notice and hearing provisions, see, \ne.g., 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341, 342, and also evaluate whether a new NEPA analysis is required to assess \nthe environmental impacts of terminating the CBDTP.  \nFollowing the OMB termination regulations, while not abandoning the Secretary’s stated \nrationale, will provide alternative and more defensible grounds for the ending of the CBDTP \nprogram.

FINDINGS OF FACT \nThe Court begins by reviewing the federal and state laws that combined to authorize the \ncreation of the Tolling Program, then turns to a brief history of the cooperative endeavors of the \nfederal, state, and local governments to design and implement the Tolling Program, and finally \nsummarizes the more recent breakdown of that cooperative approach.4 \n \n4 The Court has had several additional occasions to recount the Tolling Program’s origination and \npath to implementation.  See Mulgrew v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 750 F. Supp. 3d 171, 195 (S.D.N.Y. \n2024); Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp. (“Chan I”), 2024 WL 5199945, at *4–11 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, \n2024); Chan v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp. (“Chan II”), 2025 WL 1144703, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, \n2025).   \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 5 of 109\nA.  Authorizing Statutes \n1.  The Value Pricing Pilot Program \nAlthough states are usually free to toll roads within their borders, Section 301 of the \nFederal-Aid Highways Act (“FAHA”) provides that “[e]xcept as provided in section 129 of this \ntitle with respect to certain toll bridges and toll tunnels, all highways constructed under the \nprovisions of this title shall be free from tolls of all kinds.”  23 U.S.C. § 301.  Section 129 in turn \nenumerates broad exceptions in which tolling is permitted.  See id. § 129. \nCongress  enacted  the  Intermodal  Surface  Transportation  Efficiency  Act  of  1991 \n(“ISTEA”) to “develop a National Intermodal Transportation System that is economically efficient \nand environmentally sound, provides the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global \neconomy, and will move people and goods in an energy efficient manner” and to “reduce energy \nconsumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.”  Pub. L. No. 102-240, \n§ 2, 105 Stat. 1914 (1991).5   \nISTEA created the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, which directed the Secretary of \nTransportation to “solicit the participation of State and local governments and public authorities \nfor one or more congestion pricing pilot projects” and stated that “[t]he Secretary may enter into \ncooperative agreements with as many as 5 such State or local governments or public authorities to \nestablish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing projects.”  Id. § 1012(b).  ISTEA provided that \n“[n]otwithstanding sections 129 and 301 of title 23, United States Code, the Secretary shall allow \nthe use of tolls on the Interstate System as part of a pilot program under this section, but not on \n \n5 President Bush signed ISTEA into law on December 18, 1991, noting that a “major element” of \nthe  law  “was  to  provide  State  and  local  officials  unprecedented  flexibility”  including  “the \ndiscretion to use a major portion of their Federal surface transportation funds on the improvements \nthat would best meet local needs, whether highway projects or public transit projects.”  Statement \nby President George Bush Upon Signing H.R. 2950, 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1865 (Dec. 18, 1991). \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 6 of 109\nmore than 3 of such programs.”  Id. § 1012(b)(4).  It directed that “[r]evenues generated by any \npilot project under this subsection must be applied to projects eligible under such title.”  Id. \n§ 1012(b)(3).  ISTEA also provided that “[t]he Secretary shall monitor the effect of such projects \nfor a period of at least 10 years, and shall report to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of \nRepresentatives every 2 years on the effects such programs are having on driver behavior, traffic, \nvolume, transit ridership, air quality, and availability of funds for transportation programs.”  Id. \n§ 1012(b)(5).  ISTEA also directed that as part of each state’s transportation planning process, the \nstate should consider, “[w]here appropriate, the use of innovative mechanisms for financing \nprojects, including value capture pricing, tolls, and congestion pricing.”  Id. § 1025(c)(16). \nCongress renamed the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program the Value Pricing Pilot Program \n(“VPPP”) in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of 1998 (“TEA-21C”).  Pub. L. \nNo. 105-178, § 1216(a) (1998).  TEA-21C removed the three-program cap on the number of \nprograms that could include the use of tolls on the Interstate System.  Id. § 1216(a)(4).  It also \nincreased the overall number of cooperative agreements into which the Secretary could enter from \nfive to fifteen.  Id. § 1216(a)(2).  The VPPP is presently codified as a note to 23 U.S.C. § 149.  See \nJohnson v. Everyrealm, Inc., 657 F. Supp. 3d 535, 559 n.19 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) (“It is of no moment \nthat this provision was . . . codified as a statutory note, as opposed to a statutory subsection.”). \n2.  The Traffic Mobility Act \nFor many years, the Manhattan CBD was one of the most congested urban areas in the \ncountry.  SCAC ¶ 2.  The sheer quantity of vehicles attempting to navigate the CBD resulted in \nslow travel times, lost productivity, poor air quality, slower and less reliable public bus service, \ndelayed emergency response times, and reduced public safety.  Id. ¶¶ 2–3.  In more recent years, \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 7 of 109\nthe harmful effects of congestion imposed a $20 billion cost on businesses, commuters, and \nresidents.  Id. \nPolicymakers have long debated how to address this issue.  In the 1950s, Nobel laureate \nand Columbia University economist William S. Vickrey proposed a market-based solution to \nresolve New York’s roadway congestion: charging vehicles a toll to drive in highly congested \nareas—an approach now called “congestion pricing.”  Id. ¶ 3; see also William S. Vickrey, Pricing \nin Urban and Suburban Transport, 53 Am. Econ. Rev. 452 (1963).   \nThroughout the following decades, New York state and local officials, policy experts, and \nadvocacy groups continued to study potential solutions.  SCAC ¶ 3.  Professor Vickrey’s proposal \ngained some traction in New York in the 1970s, when New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller \nand New York City Mayor John Lindsay submitted a proposal to the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency (“EPA”) to toll the bridges along the East and Harlem Rivers.  See Mulgrew, \n750 F. Supp. 3d at 189.  That proposal was ultimately withdrawn after the EPA concluded it would \nbe unnecessary in light of other planned traffic control measures.  See id.  In 2007, New York City \nMayor Michael Bloomberg again sought to implement congestion pricing in New York City, \nproposing that the city toll drivers in Manhattan south of 86th Street, with the revenue to be applied \nto capital investments in the city’s transit network.  Dkt. No. 96 ¶ 86.6  The New York legislature \nresponded to Mayor Bloomberg’s proposal by establishing the New York City Traffic Congestion \nMitigation Commission, a body of seventeen members appointed by the Governor, to study \napproaches to reducing congestion in the busiest parts of Manhattan, and develop a comprehensive \ntraffic congestion mitigation plan.  See Mulgrew, 750 F. Supp. 3d at 189.  The Commission \n \n6 See Maria Newman, Mayor Proposes a Fee for Driving in to Manhattan, N.Y. Times (Apr. 22, \n2007), https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/nyregion/23mayorcnd.html. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 8 of 109\nsurveyed a wide array of potential congestion-reducing mechanism and ultimately conducted in-\ndepth studies of the five options that the Commission believed could achieve the Legislature’s goal \nof reducing the average vehicle miles traveled (“VMT”) in the congestion relief zone by at least \n6.3%: congestion pricing, bridge tolling, parking and taxi pricing schemes, and license plate \nrationing.  Id.  The Commission ultimately recommended that the Legislature implement the \ncongestion pricing option but suggested alterations to the boundaries of the congestion relief \nzone—boundaries similar to those ultimately adopted in connection with the Tolling Program.  Id.   \nThe USDOT and FHWA supported the city’s efforts to enact this area-wide congestion \npricing scheme.  In 2007, the USDOT entered into an “Urban Partnership Agreement” with the \nNYSDOT and awarded the state $5 million to pursue “a broad area pricing system in Manhattan \nsouth of 86th Street.”  Dkt. No. 62-6; Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 10 n.4.  The FHWA also highlighted the project \nthroughout a 2009 report to Congress, describing it in glowing terms as a “historic” “cordon \npricing” scheme.  SCAC ¶ 86.7  Ultimately, the 2007 proposal stalled in the New York Legislature \nand was not enacted into law.  Id. \nNew York was not the only city focused on the possibility of congestion pricing; since \nProfessor  Vickery’s  early  proposals,  London,  Singapore,  Stockholm,  and  Milan  have  each \nimplemented their own congestion pricing programs.  Id. ¶¶ 56–59. \nUltimately, in April 2019, the New York Legislature passed the Traffic Mobility Act \n(“TMA”), directing the TBTA to establish the Tolling Program.  N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law §§ 1701 \net seq.  The TMA’s legislative findings and declaration stated that “[i]n order to ensure a safe and \n \n7 FHWA, Report on The Value Pricing Pilot Program Through May 2009 at ii, 13–14 (Sept. 17, \n2009), \nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/value_pricing/pubs_reports/rpttocongress/pdf/vppp09\nrpt.pdf. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 9 of 109\nefficient mass transit system within the city of New York and to protect the public health and safety \nof New York’s residents, a program to establish tolls for vehicles entering or remaining in the most \ncongested area of the state is found to be necessary and to be a matter of substantial state concern.”  \nId. § 1701.8 \nThe TMA set a revenue requirement, directing that the TBTA “shall, at minimum, ensure \nannual revenues and fees collected under such program, less costs of operation of the same, provide \nfor sufficient revenues . . . necessary to fund fifteen billion dollars for capital projects for the 2020 \nto 2024 MTA capital program.”  Id. § 1404-a(1).  To meet that revenue requirement and reduce \ncongestion, the TMA authorized the TBTA to “establish and charge variable tolls and fees for \nvehicles entering or remaining in the central business district at any time” but set forth certain \nguidelines including that “no toll may be established and charged on passenger vehicles . . . more \nthan once per day for purposes of entering the central business district” and exemptions for \nqualifying emergency vehicles and qualifying vehicles transporting individuals with disabilities.  \nId. § 1704-a.  It also required the TBTA to “implement a plan for credits, discounts and/or \nexemptions for tolls paid on bridges and crossings informed by the recommendations of the traffic \nmobility review board” (“TMRB”).  Id. § 1704-a(3)(a).  And it permitted the TBTA “to provide \nadditional credits, discounts and exemptions informed by the recommendations of the [TMRB] \nand a traffic study that considers impact.”  Id. § 1704-a(3)(b).  The Legislature also established a \ntax credit for low-income individuals living in the CBD.  N.Y. Tax Law § 606(jjj).  Individuals \n \n8 The TMA provided that the CBD “shall include the geographic area in the borough of Manhattan \nsouth of and inclusive of sixtieth street to the extent practicable but shall not include the FDR \nDrive, and New York state route 9A otherwise known as the ‘West Side highway’ including the \nBattery Park underpass and any surface roadway portion of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel connecting \nto West St.”  Id. § 1704(2). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 10 of 109\nwho live in the CBD and have an adjusted gross income under $60,000 may claim a tax credit in \nthe amount of the tolls they paid less any tolls claimed as business expenses.  Id. \nB.  Cooperation Between the Federal, State, and Local Agencies \nOver the following years—and over the course of two presidential administrations—\nfederal, state, and local agencies worked together to design, approve, and implement the Tolling \nProgram.  \n1.  Cross-Agency Communications \nIn the spring of 2019, following passage of the VMA, the TBTA, NYSDOT, and NYCDOT \n(collectively, the “Project Sponsors”) initiated contact with the USDOT and FHWA to discuss the \nTolling Program.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶¶ 2, 4.  Over the course of the following months, representatives \nof  the  various  agencies  participated  in  several  in-person  meetings  and  numerous  telephone \nconferences.  Id. ¶ 4.  At those meetings, and particularly at the April 2019 meetings with USDOT \nand FHWA, the Project Sponsors provided detailed explanations of the contemplated operation of \nthe Tolling Program.  Id. ¶ 5.  They explained that the Tolling Program would address congestion \nby imposing tolls on vehicles entering the CBD and that the Tolling Program would incorporate \ntoll rates that would provide a new and recurring source of revenue for the MTA’s capital projects.  \nId.; Dkt. No. 91-1.  The presentations explained how the imposition of the tolls and the use of the \nrevenues generated from the tolls would work in tandem to reduce traffic and to improve the \nquality of life for those using the CBD: the tolls would directly reduce the number of vehicles \nentering the CBD while the use of the revenue generated by the tolls to finance bonds for capital \nprojects for mass transit would indirectly reduce the number of vehicles entering the CBD by \ndiverting more travelers to mass transit.  Dkt. No. 91-1.  The presentations also highlighted the \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 11 of 109\nfact that the Tolling Program would not include a toll-free route.  Id. at 6.9  The meetings did not \ndiscuss a specific end date for the Tolling Program, but contemplated that monitoring efforts would \ntake over a year to begin and would last for years thereafter.  Id. \nThe USDOT and FHWA determined that the Tolling Program would require approval from \nthe FHWA to implement tolls on federal-aid highways through the Value Pricing Pilot Program.  \nDkt. No. 91 ¶¶ 3, 6; Dkt. No. 91-1 at 2.  At a meeting between representatives of the FHWA, \nFederal Transit Administration (“FTA”), USDOT, NYCDOT, MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and New \nYork Governor’s Office held on April 24, 2019 at the FHWA New York Division Office, the \nfederal agencies explained that the NYSDOT had already been allotted one of the fifteen value \npricing pilot project slots for the project.  Dkt. No. 91-1 at 2.  The agencies agreed that the next \nsteps would be for the FHWA to send the Project Sponsors a template for a VPPP “Expression of \nInterest,” which was needed to commence the eligibility/approval process, as well as an example \nof a VPPP cooperative agreement.  Id.; Dkt. No. 91 ¶ 6.   \nOn June 17, 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted an Expression of Interest (“EoI”) to the \nFHWA seeking approval of the Tolling Program under the VPPP.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶ 8; Dkt. No. 91-\n2.  The EoI described the program, including the boundaries of the CBD and the fact that \n“[r]evenue raised by the program will provide sustained funding for public transportation, which \nas it becomes more reliable, will contribute to congestion relief.”  Dkt. No. 91-2 at 6.10  It identified \nfive project goals for the project: (1) “Reduce traffic congestion”; (2) “Improve air quality”; \n(3) “Create a sustainable funding source to repair and revitalize the MTA transit system,” including \nby “generat[ing] revenues, net of VPPP operating costs, to support $15 billion in bonds for MTA \n \n9 ECF pagination. \n10 ECF pagination. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 12 of 109\ncapital transit repair and revitalization projects”; (4) “Increase transit ridership”; and (5) “Improve \ntravel options for low-income residents.”  Id. at 6–7.  The EoI also described the imperative to \naddress congestion in the CBD: \nTraffic congestion adversely affects the economy and quality of life in New York \nCity and the metropolitan region.  Low travel speeds and unreliable travel times \nincrease auto commute times and erode worker productivity; reduce bus service \nquality and depress ridership; raise the cost of deliveries and the overall cost of \nbusiness; increase vehicle emissions; and degrade the quality of life for residents, \nvisitors, and workers.  According to a 2018 analysis by the Partnership for New \nYork  City,  . . .  congestion  in  the  New  York  City  region  will  cost  business, \ncommuters, and residents $100 billion over the next five years. \n  \nId.  The EoI noted that “[n]inety-eight percent of low-income workers with jobs in the Manhattan \nCBD do not commute by private vehicle.”  Id. at 9.  Accordingly, it explained, investing in transit \nand improving public bus speed and reliability will disproportionately benefit low-income New \nYorkers “who overwhelmingly rely on transit to access employment, education, and essential \nservices.”  Id. at 9–10. \nOn October 24, 2024, the FHWA responded to the EoI with a letter requesting further \ninformation.  Dkt. No. 91-3.  The letter stated that “[u]nder the various programs in Federal law \nthat allow tolling of existing infrastructure, the VPPP appears to be the best potential fit.”  Id. at 1.  \nIt continued: \nAs you are aware, the VPPP is intended to demonstrate whether and to what extent \nroadway congestion may be reduced through application of congestion pricing \nstrategies, and the magnitude of the impact of such strategies on driver behavior, \ntraffic  volumes,  transit  ridership,  air  quality  and  availability  of  funds  for \ntransportation programs.  In fact, of the multiple VPPP projects that have been \nimplemented, FHWA has found that congestion pricing can be very effective for \nreducing traffic, improving roadway capacity, and providing reliable trips for \nautomobiles as well as commercial vehicles and transit vehicles. \nId.  The letter also noted that revenues from the Tolling Program would be used for improving \ntransit systems.  See id. at 2.  It stated that “[f]or FHWA to conduct a thorough assessment, the \nAgency requests the findings of a thorough traffic and revenue study” including certain specified \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 13 of 109\nconsiderations.  Id. at 1–2.  In particular, the FHWA’s letter noted that “the proposed project is an \narea-wide congestion pricing system, which is unprecedented in the VPPP and such type system \nhas not yet been implemented in the U.S.” and “[t]herefore, FHWA must consider the precedents \nset by this project.”  Id. at 2.  The letter further stated: \nIf the Central Business District Tolling Project proceeds to the implementation \nstage, a toll agreement between FHWA, your agency, and the other project partners \nwould need to be developed and signed to secure Federal tolling authority under \nthe VPPP.  Upon execution of the toll agreement with FHWA, [NYSDOT] and \nyour partners could then implement the project and collect and use the toll revenues \nconsistent with the legal requirements outlined in Title 23, United States Code. \nId. at 2. \nAfter receiving the FHWA’s letter, the Project Sponsors met with the FHWA twice and \nthe USDOT once and obtained more guidance on the request for information.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶ 11.  \nThe agencies also discussed the use of the Tolling Program’s revenues for capital improvement to \npublic transit.  Id.  On December 17, 2019, the Project Sponsors submitted a letter to the FHWA \nproviding the requested information.  Dkt. No. 91-4.  On January 27, 2020, the Project Sponsors \nfollowed up by submitting the Traffic and Revenue Study that the FHWA had requested.  Dkt. \nNo. 91 ¶ 12; Dkt. No. 91-5. \nOn July 2, 2020, the Project Sponsors sent the FHWA a letter following up on the EoI and \nseeking  commencement  of  the  environmental  review  process  required  by  the  National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  Dkt. No. 91-6.  The FHWA responded on September 3, \n2020, noting that “[s]hortly after your submission of the [Traffic and Revenue] Study, the COVID-\n19 public health emergency resulted in an unprecedented situation that has created unforeseen \ncircumstances across the country, and especially in New York City.”  Dkt. No. 91-7 at 2.11  The \nFHWA explained that the actions taken by the Governor, Mayor, and public officials to “order \n \n11 ECF pagination. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 14 of 109\nlockdowns, closures of businesses, and impose restrictions on the use of public transit . . . have \nhad many unforeseen impacts, including to traffic within the CBD.”  Id.  In consideration of those \ncircumstances, the FHWA requested “updated data on the COVID-19 impacts to current and \nanticipated traffic levels in the CBD and impacts to public transit ridership.”  Id. \nThe Project Sponsors responded on October 13, 2020.  Dkt. No. 91-8.  Their response \nexplained that while the MTA’s transit ridership remained lower than pre-pandemic rates, there \nhad been steady improvements.  Id. at 1.  It noted that by September 2020, the traffic on MTA’s \nbridges and tunnels in September 2020 had risen to 86% of the previous year’s traffic during that \nperiod and weekday daily volumes entering the CBD had reached roughly 95% of pre-COVID \nlevels by mid-September 2020.  Id.  The Project Sponsors also noted that “[t]his data is consistent \nwith reports from WAZE which show New York City nearing pre-COVID traffic levels and \nrebounding faster than other cities” and also that the city was facing the significant congestion \nassociated with high levels of traffic.  Id. at 1–2.  The Project Sponsors once again inquired how \nNEPA review should proceed.  See id. \nOn March 30, 2021, the FHWA responded with a letter stating that “[a]fter careful review \nof the relevant information, FHWA believes that our mutual goals of producing needed traffic and \nair quality analysis and soliciting robust public input from all stakeholders can best be achieved \nthrough the preparation of an Environmental Assessment.”  Dkt. No. 91-9.  The letter once again \nconfirmed the FHWA’s understanding that “[t]his important and potentially precedent-setting \nproject would include variable tolling once a day for vehicles entering or remaining within . . . the \nCentral Business District.”  Id. at 1. \n2.  NEPA Review \nA lengthy environmental review process under NEPA followed, culminating in the April \n2023 Final Environmental Assessment (“EA”) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”) \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 15 of 109\nby the FHWA.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶¶ 15, 17.  The EA identified two primary, and complementary, needs: \nthe need to reduce vehicle congestion in the CBD, and the need to create a new local, recurring \nfunding source to support the financing of $15 billion for MTA transit capital projects in the \nagency’s 2020-2024 Capital Program.  Id. ¶ 15.12  The EA additionally identified two specific \ncongestion reduction objectives: the reduction of daily VMT in the CBD by at least 5% and the \nreduction of daily vehicles entering the CBD by at least 10%.  Id.  Because the TBTA had not yet \nadopted a defined tolling structure, the EA analyzed seven different tolling scenarios with tolls for \npassenger cars ranging from $9 to $23 (with different rates for different classes of vehicles) and \nvariable credits and exemptions.  Id. ¶ 16.13  In addition to the seven tolling scenarios, the EA \nanalyzed a no action alternative as the benchmark against which to measure the predicted impacts \nof the tolling scenarios.14  The EA explained that “[u]nder the No Action Alternative, existing \npolicies and programs would continue, and planned transportation, policy, and development \ninitiatives that are independent of the CBD Tolling Program would be implemented.”15   \nThe Final EA predicted that the Tolling Program would meet each of the program’s \nobjectives and that it would not have adverse effects on air quality.  Dkt. No. 96 ¶¶ 111–112.  \nNevertheless,  the  Project  Sponsors  committed  to  implement  mitigation  measures  totaling \n$155 million to improve air quality and public health in communities with preexisting pollution \nand health burdens.  Id. ¶ 111.  The Final EA also predicted many beneficial environmental effects \nof the Tolling Program, including but not limited to: (1) reducing emissions of harmful air \n \n12 See Chapter 1, Central Business District (CBD) Tolling Program Environmental Assessment \n(April 2023), https://www.mta.info/document/110766. \n13 See Chapter 2, Central Business District (CBD) Tolling Program Environmental Assessment \n(April 2023), https://www.mta.info/document/110771. \n14 See id. at 2–4. \n15 Id. \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 16 of 109\npollutants, both within the CBD and throughout the region-wide; (2) reducing delays at many \nintersections and highway segments, thereby improving travel times, reducing vehicle operating \ncosts, and improving safety; and (3) reducing regional energy consumption and greenhouse gas \nemissions, thereby helping to meet carbon reduction goals.  Id. ¶ 113.   \nThe Final EA also concluded that the Tolling Program “would provide an economic benefit \nto the Manhattan CBD, and thus to the region and nation.”  Dkt. No. at 16.16  It noted that “[g]iven \nthe breadth of public transportation options to, from, and within the Manhattan CBD, workers \ncommuting to the Manhattan CBD have a much lower rate of auto commuting relative to the \nbroader regional and New York City workforce.”17  “[O]nly 9 percent of Manhattan CBD jobs are \nheld by workers who drive to work alone.”18 \nIn May 2023, FHWA approved the Final EA.  SCAC ¶ 114.  On June 23, 2023, FHWA’s \nNew York Division Administrator signed the FONSI.  Id. ¶ 117. \nOn November 30, 2023, the TMRB issued its recommended tolling structure, which was \ninformed by the Final EA.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶ 18.19  The TBTA adopted the recommended structure on \nMarch 27, 2024, with a planned implementation date in or about June 2024.  Id. ¶ 19.20  The Project \nSponsors completed a reevaluation to assess the effects of the March 2024 adopted toll schedule \nand determine whether the FONSI was still valid.  Id.21  On June 14, 2024, the FHWA confirmed \n \n16  Final  EA  Chapter  6,  Economic  Conditions  at  6-80  (Apr.  2023), \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/110831. \n17 Id. at 6-15. \n18 Id. \n19  See  TMRB,  Congestion  Pricing  in  New  York  (Nov.  2023), \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/127761. \n20 See MTA Board Votes to Begin Public Review Process for Central Business District Tolling \nRate Schedule, MTA (Dec. 6, 2023), https://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-board-votes-begin-\npublic-review-process-central-business-district-tolling-rate. \n21  See  Central  Business  District  (CBD)  Tolling  Program,  Reevaluation  (June  24,  2024), \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/142711. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 17 of 109\nthat the reevaluation was consistent with FHWA’s regulations and determined that the FONSI \nremained valid.  Id.22 \nOn June 5, 2024, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a pause in implementation \nof the Tolling Program.  Id. ¶ 20.  On November 14, 2024, the Governor announced a proposal to \nproceed with the Tolling Program by employing a phase-in approach.  Id. ¶ 21.  That is, the tolls \nwould be implemented in phases such that the tolls for each vehicle class during Phase 1 (2025–\n2027) would be 60% of the ultimate rate, tolls during Phase 2 (2028–2030) would be 80% of the \nultimate rate, and tolls during Phase 3 (2031 onward) would be 100%.  Id. ¶¶ 21–22.23  On \nNovember 18, 2024, the TBTA Board approved the phase-in approach.  Id. ¶ 21.  The phase-in \napproach also increased certain discounts designed to alleviate the financial burden of the Tolling \nProgram.  The Low-Income Discount Plan is available to vehicle owners with a reported federal \nadjusted gross income for the previous calendar year of $50,000 or less, or who receive certain \ngovernment assistance, and allows participants to pay half-rate tolls after completing ten trips in \nthe same calendar month.  See Chan II, 2025 WL 1144703, at *7.24  The Individual Disability \nExemption Plan allows individuals with disabilities that prevent them from using public transit, or \nthe caretakers of such individuals to be exempted from the toll.

Id. ¶ 23.26  The second reevaluation concluded that, notwithstanding the \nphase-in nature of the Tolling Program, the program’s effects were consistent with those disclosed \nin the EA and that the FONSI remained valid.  Id.  On November 21, 2024, the FHWA confirmed \nthat the second reevaluation was consistent with FHWA’s regulations and determined that the \nFONSI remained valid.27 \n3.  The Value Pricing Pilot Program Agreement \nOn November 21, 2024, the FHWA, NYSDOT, TBTA, and NYCDOT, entered into an \nagreement pursuant to the VPPP.  Dkt. No. 87-1 (“VPPP Agreement”).   \nThe VPPP Agreement’s preamble notes that ISTEA, as amended, “establishes the Value \nPricing Pilot Program . . . and permits the FHWA to allow the collection of tolls as part of the \nvalue pricing pilot program.”  Id. at 1.  It further notes that as part of the Tolling Program, the \n“TBTA intends to toll an area which includes portions of highway facilities that have been \nconstructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, restored, resurfaced or maintained with title 23 funds.”  \nId.  \nThe VPPP Agreement memorializes the FHWA’s agreement “that TBTA may operate the \nProject as a toll Project in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and as a value pricing \nproject, as part of NYSDOT’s value pricing pilot program.”  Id. at 2.  It states “[a]s of the date of \nthe execution of this Agreement, the imposition of tolls under this Agreement does not render \nFederal-aid highways within the State of New York generally ineligible for Federal-aid highway \n \n26  See  Central  Business  District  (CBD)  Tolling  Program,  Reevaluation  2  (Nov.  2024), \nhttps://www.mta.info/document/158191. \n27 See Letter from Richard J. Marquis, Division Administrator, Fed. Highway Admin., to Allison \nL.

Id. at 1–2, 6–7. \nThe VPPP Agreement also highlights FHWA’s understanding that the Tolling Program’s \nnet revenue would be used to support the MTA’s capital improvement projects.  A prefatory clause \nnotes that “Section 1012(b) of ISTEA, as amended requires that all revenues received from the \noperation of a value pricing project be applied only toward the project’s operating costs (including \nproject implementation costs; mitigation measures to deal with adverse financial effects on low-\nincome  drivers;  the  proper  maintenance  of  the  Project;  any  reconstruction,  rehabilitation, \nrestoration, or resurfacing of the Project; any debt service incurred in implementing the project; a \nreasonable return on investment of any private person financing the project), and other projects \neligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code.”  Id. at 1–2.  An ambulatory clause states \nthat the “TBTA will use all toll revenues received from the operation of the Project for the \noperating costs of the project as described in attachment A (including project implementation \ncosts; mitigation measures to deal with adverse financial effects on low-income drivers; the proper \nmaintenance of the Project; any reconstruction, rehabilitation, restoration, or resurfacing of the \nProject; any debt service incurred in implementing the project; a reasonable return on investment \nof any private person financing the project), and any other projects eligible for assistance under \ntitle 23, United States Code.”  Id. at 2. \nThe  Project  Sponsors  also  agreed  to  certain  monitoring  requirements.    The  VPPP \nAgreement obligates the TBTA to “conduct or have an independent auditor conduct an annual \naudit of toll Project records to verify compliance with use of revenues and report the results of the \naudits to FHWA.”  Id. at 2.  “In lieu of the TBTA performing said audit, a report of the New York \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 20 of 109\nState Comptroller or an independent auditor furnished to FHWA may satisfy the requirement[].”  \nId. at 3.  Upon reasonable notice, the TBTA is to “make all of its records pertaining to the Project \nsubject to audit by the FHWA.”  Id.  The TBTA and NYCDOT, as applicable, shall monitor and \nreport on the project performance “from the date of implementation for a period of at least ten \nyears or to the end of the life of the Project, whichever is sooner, to evaluate the effects on driver \nbehavior, traffic volume, congestion, transit ridership, air quality, and availability of funds for \ntransportation programs.”  Id.  The VPPP Agreement states that the reports shall begin one year \nafter the operation date and shall be made every two years thereafter.  Id. at 3.  The TBTA and \nNYCDOT are also to “identify benefits the application of tolls has in reducing climate pollution” \nand “demonstrate the benefits mitigation measures provide to underserved communities.”  Id.  \nThe VPPP Agreement sets forth “performance metrics of the system for evaluating the \neffectiveness of the pilot program.”  Id. at 9.  The metrics for measuring congestion include: \n(1) reducing VMT within the CBD by 6.4% (Phase 1) to 8.9% (Phase 3); (2) reducing the number \nof vehicles entering the CBD by 13.4% (Phase 1) to 17% (Phase 3); and (3) increasing transit use \nentering the CBD.  Id.   \nThe VPPP Agreement specifies “[t]hat NYSDOT, TBTA and NYCDOT agree to comply \nwith all Federal laws and requirements applicable to this project, including the laws and policies \napplicable to the Value Pricing Pilot Program.”  Id. at 3.  “Such laws and requirements include, \nbut are not limited to Section 1012(b) of ISTEA, as amended, the guidance implementing \nSection 1012(b) of ISTEA, and 23 CFR Part 940 and 950.”  Id.  It also obligates the TBTA, through \nNYSDOT, to provide the FHWA notice of any proposed changes to the toll structure at least sixty \ndays before such changes go into effect.  Id. at 4.  The VPPP Agreement states that the “NYSDOT, \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 21 of 109\nTBTA, and NYCDOT agree they will work with FHWA to return the Project to its original \noperating condition if TBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id.   \n4.  Legal Challenges to the Tolling Program \nBeginning even prior to the Tolling Program’s implementation, several federal lawsuits \nsought to halt the program.  See, Chan et al. v. U.S. Department of Transportation et al., 23-cv-\n10365 (S.D.N.Y.); Mulgrew et al. v. U.S. Department of Transportation et al., 24-cv-1644 \n(S.D.N.Y.);  New  Yorkers  Against  Congestion  Pricing  Tax  et  al.  v.  U.S.  Department  of \nTransportation et al., 24-cv-367 (S.D.N.Y.); Trucking Association of New York v. Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority et al., 24-cv-4111 (S.D.N.Y.); County Of Rockland et al v. Triborough \nBridge and Tunnel Authority et al., 24-cv-2285 (S.D.N.Y.); Neuhaus et al. v. Triborough Bridge \nand Tunnel Authority et al., 24-cv-3983 (S.D.N.Y.); Town of Hempstead v. Triborough Bridge and \nTunnel  Authority,  24-cv-3263  (E.D.N.Y.)28;  New  Jersey  v.  United  States  Department  of \nTransportation et al., 23-cv-3885 (D.N.J.).  The lawsuits asserted federal and state constitutional \nand procedural challenges to the Tolling Program.  The Project Sponsors and the FHWA served \nas codefendants in many of those cases and cooperated to jointly defend the constitutionality of \nthe Tolling Program and the process by which it was implemented.  \nThe  first  four—Chan,  Mulgrew,  New  Yorkers  Against  Congestion  Pricing  Tax,  and \nTrucking Association of New York—are currently pending before this Court.  In December of 2024, \nthe Court denied the plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction including because the \nplaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits of their arguments \nthat the Tolling Program violated the United States or New York Constitutions.  In April of 2025, \n \n28 Another case captioned Town of Hempstead et al v. Hochul et al., 24-cv-8121 (E.D.N.Y.) was \nremoved from the New York Supreme Court, Nassau County to the Eastern District of New York \nin November of 2024, but was remanded to state court in December of 2024. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 22 of 109\nthe Court dismissed many of the plaintiffs’ constitutional and procedural claims (some with \nprejudice and some without) and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the government \ndefendants.  In March of 2025, the Court denied the Secretary’s motion to stay Chan, Mulgrew, \nand New Yorkers Against Congestion Pricing Tax pending resolution of the instant case.  Amended \npleadings in Chan, Mulgrew, and Trucking Association of New York are due in mid-June of 2025.   \nCounty Of Rockland and Neuhaus are currently pending in this District before Judge Cathy \nSeibel.  In December of 2024, Judge Seibel denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction including because the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm or a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their arguments that the Tolling Program is unconstitutional.  The County \nOf Rockland plaintiffs appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction to the Second Circuit and \nthat appeal is currently pending, but it is not yet fully briefed.  The district court case is not stayed \npending the appeal and the parties in both County Of Rockland and Neuhaus have fully briefed \nmotions to dismiss.   \nTown of Hempstead is pending before Judge Joan M. Azrack in the Eastern District of New \nYork.   \nNew Jersey is pending in the District of New Jersey before Judge Leo M. Gordon.  In \nDecember of 2025, Judge Gordon granted in part and denied in part the parties’ motions for \nsummary judgment, remanding certain issues to the FHWA for further environmental review or \nexplanation.  However, Judge Gordon denied the plaintiffs’ requests for emergency injunctive \nrelief, holding that they failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable \nharm.  In January of 2025, the plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal to the Third Circuit \nchallenging the denial of injunctive relief.  On January 4, 2025, Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas \ndenied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction to halt the Tolling Program and the \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 23 of 109\nplaintiffs thereafter stipulated to a dismissal of the appeal.  In February of 2025, the Secretary \nmoved to stay the district court case pending resolution of the instant case, but ultimately withdrew \nthe motion to stay before it was ruled upon. \n5.  Implementation of the Tolling Program and Immediate Effects \nThe TBTA expended over $500 million to establish the Tolling Program.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶ 30.  \nThese expenditures included developing the methodological approach; conducting the assessment \nand extensive outreach and developing the final documentation for the environmental review \nprocess  under  NEPA;  design,  development,  implementation  and  testing  of  the  roadway \ninfrastructure and system; design, development, implementation and testing of the back-office \nsystem; additional extensive outreach for the state administrative review process; staff costs, \nincluding new staff for the Tolling Program; and consulting costs.  Id. \nOn January 5, 2025, the Tolling Program went into effect.  Id. ¶ 25.   \nThe initial data since then indicates a noticeable reduction in congestion within the CBD \nas compared to the same time period in 2024, along with attendant benefits to public health and \nsafety.  Traffic in the CBD decreased substantially, with approximately 5.8 million fewer vehicles \nentering the CBD in January through March of 2025 than would be expected based on data for \nprior years.  Id. ¶ 25(a).29  Total VMT by all vehicles in the CBD went down by 10% from January \nto mid-March of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.

Manhattan is looking for business, \nnot looking to kill business! \nDkt. No. 87-2.   \nOn February 19, 2025, approximately one month after President Trump assumed the office, \nthe White House posted on the social media site X an image of President Trump wearing a \nbejeweled crown underneath the superimposed words “TRUMP” and “LONG LIVE THE KING.”  \nDkt. No. 87-4.44  The image was accompanied by the text:  \n“CONGESTION  PRICING  IS  DEAD.    Manhattan,  and  all  of  New  York,  is \nSAVED.  LONG LIVE THE KING!”  \n--President Donald  J. Trump.  \nId. \nThat same day, February 19, 2025, Secretary Duffy sent a letter to Governor Hochul \n“rescinding FHWA’s approval of the CBDTP pilot project under the November 21 Agreement and \nterminating the Agreement.”  Dkt. No. 87-5 (“February 19 Letter”).45 \nThe February 19 Letter stated that Secretary Duffy had been recently sworn into office and \nthat “[u]pon assuming my responsibilities, President Trump asked me to review FHWA’s approval \nof [the Tolling Program] as a pilot project under VPPP.”  Id. at 2.46  Secretary Duffy noted concerns \nraised by the Governor of New Jersey and the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of \nTransportation on the Tolling Program’s impacts on New Jersey commuters and residents.  Id. at \n3.  The February 19 Letter also stated that the Secretary had “been made aware that legal challenges \n \n44 But see Art. I, § 9, cl. 8 (“No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no \nPerson holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the \nCongress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any \nKing, Prince, or foreign State.”). \n45 The letter also cc’ed the Commissioner of the NYSDOT, the President of the TBTA, and the \nCommissioner of the NYCDOT.  Id. \n46 ECF pagination. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 27 of 109\nare pending regarding the project, which question whether the scope of the project exceeds the \nauthority of VPPP.”  Id.  The February 19 Letter stated that the Tolling Program “left highway \nusers without any free highway alternative on which to travel within the relevant area.”  Id.  \n“Moreover, the revenues generated under this pilot program are directed toward the transit system \nas opposed to the highways.”  Id. \nSecretary Duffy wrote that “[i]n light of the President’s concerns about the [Tolling \nProgram], the legal challenges that have been made, as well as the concerns expressed by New \nJersey  Governor  Murphy  and  New  Jersey  Commissioner  O’Connor,  I  reviewed  the  tolling \nauthority granted under VPPP to the [Tolling Program] for compliance with Federal law.”  Id.  \nBased on that review, the Secretary “concluded that the scope of this pilot project as approved \nexceeds the authority authorized by Congress under VPPP.”  Id. \nSecretary Duffy then stated the reasons that formed the basis for his conclusion that the \nFHWA did not have the authority to sign the VPPP Agreement.  The February 19 Letter noted as \na threshold matter that the “long-standing history of the anti-tolling provision” preventing states \nfrom imposing tolls on federal-aid highways, Section 301, “requires me to narrowly construe this \nexception.”  Id. at 3–4.  Secretary Duffy then wrote that he concluded the Tolling Program was \nnot an eligible “value pricing pilot program” for two reasons.  Id. at 4. \nFirst, according to Secretary Duffy, the Tolling Program “uses a method of tolling known \nas ‘cordon pricing,’” which he does not believe to have been authorized by the VPPP.  Id.  The \nletter explains that “unlike other forms of tolling, the [Tolling Program’s] cordon pricing program \nprovides no toll-free option for many drivers who want or need to travel by vehicle in this major \nurbanized area.”  Id.  The February 19 Letter noted that Congress has, in a separate statutory \nprovision, authorized cordon pricing on the interstate system where drivers can choose a non-\n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 28 of 109\ninterstate route.  Id. (citing 23 U.S.C. § 129(d)(4)(B), (6)(A)).  But, it asserted, “no statute \ncontemplates cordon pricing in a situation where tolls are inescapable, and FHWA has never before \napproved a VPPP program that uses cordon pricing or that does not provide a toll-free option.”  Id.  \nAccordingly, the Secretary “concluded that Congress did not, in using the vague phrase ‘value \npricing pilot program,’ authorize the unprecedented and consequential step of cordon pricing.”  \nId.47 \nSecond, the Secretary’s letter noted that the imposition of tolls under the Tolling Program \n“appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the [MTA]” and asserted that the \n“VPPP does not authorize tolls that are calculated based on considerations separate from reducing \ncongestion or advancing other road-related goals.”  Id. \nThe February 19 Letter stated that because the “FHWA lacked statutory authority to \napprove the cordon pricing tolling under the [Tolling Program], I am rescinding FHWA’s approval \nof the [Tolling Program] under the November 21 Agreement and terminating the Agreement.”  Id.  \nSecretary Duffy noted that his “determination represents a change in position” from the FHWA’s \nprevious approach to the Tolling Program’s eligibility, but he stated that because the FHWA did \nnot explain the basis for its prior conclusion concerning eligibility, “nothing in the prior approval \nundermines the above analysis upon which my determination is based.”  Id. at 4–5.  Secretary \nDuffy also noted in the February 19 Letter that the “TBTA and NYSDOT have relied on the \nAgreement to begin collecting tolls under the program, but I have concluded that such reliance \nshould not prevent the termination of the November 21 Agreement, including because many of the \n \n47 The Secretary noted that “the Town of Hempstead and its supervisor have sued FHWA, TBTA, \nand NYSDOT making this argument.”  Id. (citing Town of Hempstead v. Triborough Bridge and \nTunnel Authority, 24-cv-3263 (E.D.N.Y.)).  The Secretary wrote that “I believe that FHWA faces \na significant risk of loss in that litigation.”  Id. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 29 of 109\ncosts the TBTA and NYSDOT incurred related to the program were incurred before the FHWA \nsigned the VPPP Agreement.”  Id. at 5.  The February 19 Letter further stated that the “FHWA is \nnot aware of any substantial costs associated with the physical stopping of the program” and that \nwhile termination may deprive the MTA of funding, “any reliance on that funding stream was not \nreasonable given that FHWA approved only a ‘pilot project.’”  Id.  Finally, it stated that “any \nreliance interests cannot overcome the conclusion that FHWA’s approval was not authorized by \nlaw.”  Id.  The February 19 Letter stated that the FHWA would “contact NYSDOT and its project \nsponsors to discuss the orderly cessation of toll operations under this terminated pilot project.”  Id. \nThe MTA and TBTA initiated this litigation by filing a complaint later the same day.  Dkt. \nNo. 1.  The complaint stated that “Plaintiffs will continue to operate the Program as required by \nNew York law until and unless Plaintiffs are directed to stop by a court order.”  Id. ¶ 120. \nThe next day, February 20, 2025, the Executive Director sent a letter to the Commissioner \nof the NYSDOT, the President of the TBTA, and the Commissioner of the NYCDOT “to discuss \nthe orderly cessation of toll operations under the [Tolling Program.”  Dkt. No. 87-6.  The letter \nstated that “Secretary Duffy’s February 19, 2025, letter terminat[ed] the November 21, 2024 Value \nPricing Pilot Program [] Agreement under which the Federal Highway Administration [] ha[d] \napproved the implementation of tolls as part of the New York’s Central Business District Tolling \nProgram.”  Id.  However, it stated that “[i]n order to provide NYSDOT and its project sponsors \ntime to terminate operations of this pilot project in an orderly manner, this rescission of approval \nand termination of the November 21, 2024 Agreement will be effective on March 21, 2025.”  Id.  \n“Accordingly, NYSDOT and its project sponsors must cease the collection of tolls on Federal-aid \nhighways in the [CBD] by March 21, 2025.”  Id.  The letter requested that the recipients work with \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 30 of 109\nthe FHWA’s New York Division Administrator “to provide the necessary details and updates \nregarding the cessation of toll operations.”  Id. \nOn March 20, 2025, the day before the deadline set by the FHWA expired, Secretary Duffy \nposted on the social media site X, tagging Governor Hochul: \n.@GovKathyHochul — the federal government and @POTUS are putting New \nYork on Notice. \nYour refusal to end cordon pricing and your open disrespect towards the federal \ngovernment is unacceptable.  \n. . . \nYour unlawful pricing scheme charges working-class citizens to use roads their \nfederal tax dollars already paid to build. \nWe will provide New York with a 30-day extension as discussions continue. \nKnow that the billions of dollars the federal government sends to New York are not \na blank check.  Continued noncompliance will not be taken lightly. \nDkt. No. 87-7. \nThat same day, March 20, 2025, the Executive Director sent a second letter to the \nCommissioner of the NYSDOT, the President of the TBTA, and the Commissioner of the \nNYCDOT.  Dkt. No. 87-8.  Executive Director Shepherd stated that she was “writing pursuant to \nmy February 20, 2025 letter, providing you until March 21, 2025, to cease tolling operations that \nwere initiated through the November 21, 2024 Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP) Agreement.”  \nId.  She stated that “[t]he Secretary has directed that I extend the period of time to comply by 30 \ndays.”  Id.  “Accordingly, toll operations must cease by April 20, 2025.”  Id.  Executive Director \nShepherd again requested that the recipients of the letter work with the FHWA’s New York \nDivision Administrator to provide details and updates regarding the cessation.  Id. \nAt a meet-and-confer for this litigation held on April 2, 2025, Plaintiffs asked if Defendants \ncontemplated taking any unilateral action on or after April 20, 2025 that might alter the status quo \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 31 of 109\nand require Plaintiffs to seek expedited injunctive relief.  Dkt. No. 49 at 4.  The Defendants \ninformed Plaintiffs that they did not have information to disclose.  Id. \nOn April 8, 2025, the USDOT Rapid Response posted on social media site X:  \n1.  @USDOT’s position remains that New York’s elitest cordon pricing scheme is \nillegal, a form of class warfare that targets working Americans, and unfair to \nthe driving public whose tax dollars have already paid for these roads. \n2.  USDOT’s deadline for stopping toll collection has not changed.  Make no \nmistake – the Trump Administration and USDOT will not hesitate to use every \ntool at our disposal in response to non-compliance later this month. \n3.  USDOT will continue to fight tooth and nail against this unlawful tax on \nhardworking Americans. \nDkt. No 87-9. \nOn April 21, 2025, the day after the expiration of the FHWA’s extended deadline, Secretary \nDuffy sent another letter to Governor Hochul.  Secretary Duffy acknowledged that in November \n2024, before President Trump took office, the federal government had signed a VPPP agreement \n“that  authorized  an  exception  for  New  York’s  Central  Business  District  Tolling  Program \n(‘CBDTP’),” but he stated: “On February 19, 2025, I terminated that agreement.”  Dkt. No. 87-10 \nat 1 (“April 21 Letter”).48  The April 21 Letter recited that the FHWA had “made clear” that New \nYork “must cease the collection of tolls by March 21, 2025” and provide details and updates \nregarding such cessation and that it had previously extended the deadline to April 20, 2025 “[i]n a \nspirit of goodwill.”  Id. (quotation omitted).  The April 21 Letter “warn[ed]” Governor Hochul \n“that the State of New York risks serious consequences if it continues to fail to comply with \nFederal  law”  and  directed  New  York  to  show  cause  why  the  FHWA  “should  not  impose \nappropriate measures to ensure compliance.”  Id.  The April 21 Letter stated in bold: \n \n48 The April 21 Letter also cc’ed the Commissioner of the NYSDOT, the President of the TBTA, \nand the Commissioner of the NYCDOT.  Id. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 32 of 109\nI hereby direct the [NYSDOT] to show cause, no later than May 21, 2025, why \nFHWA should not take appropriate steps under 23 CFR § 1.36 to remedy New \nYork’s noncompliance with 23 U.S.C. § 301 in connection with the [Tolling \nProgram]. By that date, NYSDOT shall submit a response to FHWA’s New York \nDivision Administrator that either: (1) certifies that the collection of tolls under the \n[Tolling Program] has ceased; or (2) demonstrates that the continued collection of \ntolls does not violate 23 U.S.C. § 301.  The project’s other sponsors—the [TBTA] \nand the [NYCDOT]—may also submit responses.  \nId.  Secretary Duffy wrote that “[t]he response(s) to the directive to show cause should include any \narguments related to my determination, explained in the February 19, 2025, letter that FHWA \nlacked the statutory authority to approve the New York City cordon pricing project as a ‘value \npricing pilot project’” and should also “address the policy concerns expressed in my February 19, \n2025, letter, which were an independent basis for my decision to terminate the VPPP agreement.”  \nId. at 2.49 \nThe  April 21  Letter  stated  that  “[i]f,  after  evaluating  NYSDOT’s  response  and  any \nresponses received from TBTA and NYCDOT (or if NYSDOT fails to submit a timely response), \nFHWA determines that New York is out of compliance with 23 U.S.C. § 301, FHWA will \nimplement appropriate initial compliance measures beginning on or after May 28, 2025, until \ncompliance is achieved, to include”: (1) “No further advance construction (‘AC’) authorizations \nfor projects within the borough of Manhattan, except for projects determined by FHWA to be \nessential for safety (‘Safety Projects’)”50; (2) “No further [NEPA] approvals for projects within \nthe borough of Manhattan, except for Safety Projects”; and (3) “No further approvals of Statewide \nTransportation Improvement Program (‘STIP’) amendments concerning New York Metropolitan \n \n49 The Secretary’s letter also addressed certain arguments that the MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, and \nNYCDOT had made in their complaints in this litigation including that “the VPPP agreement is a \n‘cooperative agreement’ that may only be terminated pursuant to 2 CFR Part 200.”  Id. at 3–4. \n50 The letter noted that “Safety Projects include projects under the National Highway Performance \nProgram, Bridge Formula Program, and Highway Safety Improvement Program.”  Id. at 2 n.1.  It \ndid not provide any other information as to how the FHWA would determine whether a project \nwas “essential for safety.” \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 33 of 109\nTransportation Council (‘NYMTC’) [Transportation Improvement Plans (‘TIP’)] modifications.”  \nId. \nFurthermore,  the  April 21  Letter  stated,  “[i]f  New  York’s  noncompliance  continues, \nFHWA may consider imposing additional measures.”  Id.  According to the April 21, Letter, such \n“additional measures” could include: (1) “No further obligations of FHWA funds (both formula \nand competitive) for projects within New York City, except for Safety Projects”; (2) “No further \nAC authorizations for projects within New York City, except for Safety Projects”; and (3) “No \nfurther NEPA approvals for projects within New York City, except for Safety Projects.”  Id.  The \nApril 21 Letter states that “[t]he corrective measures noted above may be expanded to other \ngeographic areas within the State of New York, if any noncompliance continues.”  Id. \nSecretary Duffy’s April 21 Letter also stated his belief that “New York’s cordon pricing \nprogram imposes a disproportionate financial hardship on low and medium-income hardworking \nAmerican drivers for the benefit of high-income drivers” and reiterated the point that the Tolling \nProgram’s cordon pricing model is “unprecedented in the United States and is inconsistent with \nany previous pilot project approved under the VPPP.”  Id.  The April 21 Letter noted that “[a]nyone \nneeding to drive into the area is either forced to pay a cost-prohibitive toll or required to use the \nsubstandard transit system run by the [MTA].”  Id. at 2–3.  Secretary Duffy also reemphasized his \n“concern[] that the tolls collected from highway users under this pilot project have been set and \nwill be used primarily for funding transit capital projects.”  Id. at 3.  The April 21 Letter stated that \n“setting tolls with the primary goal of raising revenue for the MTA conflicts with the purpose of \nthe VPPP to initiate pilot projects designed to relieve congestion, not fund transit capital projects.”  \nId.  While the Secretary acknowledged in the April 21 Letter that “the VPPP statute permits \nrevenues from pilot programs to be used for transit projects eligible for funding under title 23 of \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 34 of 109\nthe U.S. Code,” he concluded that “it is unconscionable as a matter of policy that highway users \nare being forced to bail out the MTA transit system.”  Id.   \nSecretary Duffy stated in the April 21 Letter that “[u]nder this Administration, FHWA \npolicy will no longer support this type of project or policy.”  Id.  “While I am Secretary, FHWA \nwill only prioritize tolling projects under the VPPP that provide for toll-free alternative routes and \nset tolls with the aims of reducing congestion and/or raising revenue primarily for highway \ninfrastructure.”  Id. \nOn April 24, 2025, a spokesperson for the USDOT stated, regarding the Tolling Program, \n“if New York doesn’t shut it down, the Department of Transportation is considering halting \nprojects and funding for the [S]tate.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 19 & n.13.51 \nOn April 29, 2025, Secretary Duffy appeared on the television program Good Day New \nYork and stated that if Plaintiffs and the NYCDOT do not “treat those who want to come into \nManhattan fairly, maybe we should look at how much we send the city.”  Id. at 19 & n.14.52  He \ncontinued, “that’s what the Governor is going to have to grapple with.”  Id. \nOn May 21, 2025, the MTA, TBTA, and NYCDOT responded to the April 21 Letter’s \n“order to show cause.”  Dkt. No. 125.  Their submission did not provide the agency with new facts \nbut rather consisted almost entirely of the pleadings, briefs, and declarations filed in this case.

LEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy.”  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, \n456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982).  “Any party seeking a preliminary injunction ‘must demonstrate that it \nwill suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the requested relief.’”  Sussman v. Crawford, 488 \nF.3d 136, 140 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Latino Officers Ass’n v. Safir, 170 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. \n1999)).  In order to justify a preliminary injunction, a movant must demonstrate: (1) irreparable \nharm absent injunctive relief; (2) either a likelihood of success on the merits, or a serious question \ngoing to the merits to make them a fair ground for trial, with a balance of hardships tipping \ndecidedly in the plaintiff’s favor; and (3) that the public’s interest weighs in favor of granting an \ninjunction.  See Metro. Taxicab Bd. of Trade v. City of New York, 615 F.3d 152, 156 (2d Cir. 2010) \n(citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  “The purpose of a \npreliminary injunction is not to award the movant the ultimate relief sought in the suit but is only \nto preserve the status quo by preventing during the pendency of the suit the occurrence of that \nirreparable sort of harm which the movant fears will occur.”  Kane v. De Blasio, 19 F.4th 152, 163 \n(2d Cir. 2021) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiffs assert that they are likely to succeed on the merits of several of their underlying \ncauses of action.  They argue that (1) this Court has jurisdiction, (2) Secretary Duffy’s February 19 \nLetter is arbitrary and capricious, and (3) Defendants lack the authority to pursue any of the so-\ncalled “compliance measures” outlined in the April 21 Letter.  Dkt. No. 83 at 21–51; Dkt. No. 10–\n15; Dkt. No. 124 at 3–25; Dkt. No. 126 at 7–9.  In response, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are \nunlikely to succeed on the merits and contest each of Plaintiffs’ arguments.  Dkt. No. 118 at 13–\n28, 35–56.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 36 of 109\n1.  Jurisdiction \nPlaintiffs argue that the Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331 because Plaintiffs assert federal constitutional, equitable, and statutory claims.  Dkt. No 83 \nat 21. \nDefendants raise three arguments challenging the Court’s jurisdiction over this case.  \nDefendants claim that there is no reviewable final agency action, none of Plaintiffs’ claims is ripe \nfor judicial review, and, pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, jurisdiction over any \njusticiable part of this dispute lies solely with the Court of Federal Claims.  Dkt. No. 118 at 13–\n28.  The Court reviews each of Defendants’ arguments in turn. \na.  Final Agency Action \n“The APA explicitly requires that an agency action be final before a claim is ripe for \nreview.”  Air Espana v. Brien, 165 F.3d 148, 152 (2d Cir. 1999) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 704).53  The \nfinality requirement “allows the agency an opportunity to apply its expertise and correct its \n \n53 In Air Espana, the Second Circuit described the requirement of finality as “jurisdictional.”  Id. \n(citing DRG Funding Corp. v. Sec’y of Hous. and Urban Dev., 76 F.3d 1212, 1214 (D.C.Cir. \n1996)).  However, more recent opinions have called that descriptor into question.  In Sharkey v. \nQuarantillo, the Second Circuit noted that many circuit courts had relied upon the Supreme Court’s \nholding in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514–15 (2006) to determine that the Section 704 \nrequirement of “final agency action” is not jurisdictional.  See 541 F.3d 75, 87 n. 10 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(collecting cases).  The Second Circuit noted that “[i]t is uncertain in light of recent Supreme Court \nprecedent  whether  these  threshold  limitations  are  truly  jurisdictional  or  are  rather  essential \nelements of the APA claims for relief.”  Id. at 87.  Even more recently, the Second Circuit observed \nthat that “whether the APA’s ‘final agency action’ requirement, 5 U.S.C. § 704, is jurisdictional is \nan open question in our Circuit.”  6801 Realty Co., LLC v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., 719 \nF. App’x 58, 60 n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order); see also Dagbazhalsanova v. U.S. Citizenship \n& Immigr. Servs., 2025 WL 964071, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2025) (“The question of whether \nfinal  agency  action  is  a  jurisdictional  requirement  remains  open  in  the  Second  Circuit.”).  \nUltimately, the Court need not weigh in on the jurisdictional nature of the finality requirement as \nSection 704 is undisputably “a question of ‘statutory standing’ that permits ‘resolving the case on \nthreshold, non-merits grounds.’”  6801 Realty, 719 F. App’x at 60 n.1 (quoting In re Facebook, \nInc., Initial Pub. Offering Derivative Litig., 797 F.3d 148, 156 n.6 (2d Cir. 2015)).  The Court’s \ninclusion of the parties’ final agency action arguments beneath the “jurisdiction” heading is not \nintended to be a legal pronouncement.  \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 37 of 109\nmistakes, it avoids disrupting the agency’s processes, and it relieves the courts from having to \nengage in piecemeal review which is at the least inefficient and upon completion of the agency \nprocess might prove to have been unnecessary.”  Id. (quotation omitted).  The APA does not \nimpose an exhaustion requirement on the target of a final agency action.  See Darby v. Cisneros, \n509 U.S. 137, 154 (1993) (“[W]here the APA applies, an appeal to ‘superior agency authority’ is \na prerequisite to judicial review only when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule \nrequires appeal before review and the administrative action is made inoperative pending that \nreview.”).  \nTwo conditions must be met for an agency action to be final.  “First, the action must mark \nthe consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process—it must not be of a merely tentative \nor interlocutory nature.”  Salazar v. King, 822 F.3d 61, 82 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997)).  “And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations \nhave been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Id. (quoting Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 178).  “For the second prong, the core question is whether the result of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process is one that will directly affect the parties.”  Id. (quotation omitted).  \nDefendants argue that “the Secretary and FHWA’s actions, taken as a whole, show an ongoing \ndecision-making process that has neither reached a definitive conclusion nor imposed tangible \nlegal consequences.”  Dkt. No. 118 at 16.  Both conditions to establish final agency action have \nbeen satisfied here.   \nIt is clear from Defendants’ communications that the decision to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement was consummated by February 19, 2025 at the latest.  In the February 19 Letter, \nSecretary Duffy stated in clear terms: “I am rescinding FHWA’s approval of the [Tolling Program] \nunder the November 21 Agreement and terminating the Agreement.”  Dkt. No. 87-1 at 4.  The \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 38 of 109\nFebruary 19 Letter did not indicate that the Secretary’s decision to do so was in any way tentative \nor interlocutory, instead resting upon the “conclusion that FHWA’s approval was not authorized \nby law.”  Id. at 5.  The Secretary’s decision was not based on any discretionary analysis but on the \nconclusion that Congress did not give the FHWA the authority to approve the project.  There is \nnothing equivocal about the letter or about the Secretary’s decision.  President Trump confirmed \nthe unmistakable meaning of the February 19 Letter the same day, tweeting “CONGESTION \nPRICING IS DEAD.”  Dkt. No. 87-4.  Executive Director Shepherd’s letter dated February 20, \n2025 likewise stated in the past tense that the February 19 Letter “terminat[ed] the November 21, \n2024 Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP) Agreement.”  Dkt. No. 87-6.  In the April 21 Letter, \nSecretary Duffy confirmed that “[o]n February 19, 2025, I terminated [the VPPP] agreement” and \n“New York therefore is not legally permitted to collect tolls on roads within the [CBD] that were \nconstructed using Federal-aid highway funds.”  Dkt. No. 87-10 at 1.  Secretary Duffy stated that \nthe April 21 Letter “once again provides notice of the termination.”  Id. at 4.  A host of statements \nby Defendants and their spokespeople continued to confirm that New York’s operation of the \nTolling Program was unlawful and risked sanctions by the federal government if the state’s \n“noncompliance” continued.  See Dkt. No. 87-7; Dkt. No 87-9; Dkt. No. 83 at 19 & n.13.  Even \nDefendants’ memorandum of law repeatedly describes the February 19 Letter as a “notice of \ntermination.”  Dkt. No. 118 at i–ii, 9, 11.  And Defendants’ counsel confirmed at the preliminary \ninjunction hearing that it is still the Secretary’s position that the previous Administration lacked \nthe lawful authority to sign the VPPP Agreement, that the VPPP Agreement has been terminated \nand that, accordingly, the Tolling Program is unlawful.  Tr. at  26:4–27:2; 32:4–7; 45:22–46:5; \n47:11–48:1. \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 39 of 109\nAs the text of Defendants’ communications makes clear, the FHWA’s “deliberation” over \nwhether to terminate the VPPP Agreement and whether New York is in violation of the law is at \nan end.  See Sackett v. E.P.A., 566 U.S. 120, 129 (2012) (holding that an agency action is final \nwhen the text of the agency’s order “makes clear” that its deliberation as to whether plaintiffs \nviolated the law “is at an end” and noting that “the Agency may still have to deliberate over \nwhether it is confident enough about this conclusion to initiate litigation, but that is a separate \nsubject”); N. Am.’s Building Trades Unions v. Dep’t of Defense, 2025 WL 1423610, at *9 (D.D.C. \nMay 16, 2025) (rejecting argument that documents setting forth “the agencies’ definitive and \nauthoritative positions” were not final agency actions where they were “plainly not tentative or \npreliminary”).  The Supreme Court has taken a pragmatic approach to the finality inquiry, see FTC \nv. Standard Oil of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 239–40 (1980), “focusing on whether judicial review at the \ntime will disrupt the administrative process,” Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773, 779 (1983).  The \nconclusiveness of Defendants’ repeated declarations makes it apparent that there is no remaining \nprocess for the Court to disrupt. \nThe fact that the federal government has not yet imposed sanctions on Plaintiffs and has \nsignaled that it is still deciding whether and  what sanctions to impose does not make the \nFebruary 19 Letter any less final.  The Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett is squarely on point.  \nIn that case, the EPA had issued an administrative compliance order stating that plaintiffs had \nviolated the Clean Water Act and directing plaintiffs to restore their property pursuant to an EPA \nwork plan.  566 U.S. at 122.  The order did not impose sanctions on the plaintiffs and instead \ninvited them to “engage in informal discussion of the terms and requirements” of the order with \nthe EPA and to inform the agency of any allegations which they believed to be inaccurate.  Id. at \n126–27.   The Supreme Court rejected the agency’s argument that the order was not ripe for review \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 40 of 109\nmerely because no sanctions had been imposed, holding that the text of the compliance order made \nit clear the agency’s deliberation over whether plaintiffs were in violation of the law was at an end \nand the question of what sanctions to impose was “a separate subject.”  Id. at 129.54  And in \ncircumstances closely paralleling the facts of this case, the District of Columbia Circuit held that \nthe USDOT had “flexed its regulatory muscle, [and] cannot now evade judicial review” where the \nagency had “effectively declared the [plaintiff]’s operations unlawful and warned the [plaintiff] to \ncease and desist.”  CSI Aviation Servs., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 637 F.3d 408, 412 (D.C. Cir. \n2011).  The Circuit explained that “[a]t the very least, this cast a cloud of uncertainty” over the \nplaintiff’s continued operations and that “[i]t also put the [plaintiff] to the painful choice between \ncostly compliance and the risk of prosecution at an uncertain point in the future—a conundrum \nthat we described . . . as ‘the very dilemma [the Supreme Court has found] sufficient to warrant \njudicial review.’”  Id. (quoting Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. U.S.E.P.A., 801 F.2d 430, 439 (D.C. Cir. \n1986)).  The Second Circuit has also confirmed that the subject of an agency order need not wait \nfor the agency to pursue punitive compliance measures: in Salazar, the Second Circuit held that a \ndecision by the Department of Education not to suspend student loan collection was a final agency \naction even before the agency took any action to sanction borrowers who failed to make payments.  \n822 F.3d at 82.   \n \n54 At the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for Defendants argued that the Clean Water Act \nprovides for a statutory penalty for failure to comply with the government’s order.  Tr. at 46:20–\n47:1; see Sackett, 566 U.S. at 123 (noting that “[w]hen the EPA prevails in a civil action, the Act \nprovides for ‘a civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation’” but when “the \nEPA prevails against any person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply, \nthat amount is increased to $75,000.” (quoting 33 U.S.C. § 1319)).  That is a distinction without a \ndifference.  In Sackett, as here, the penalty was still dependent on the government taking some \naction at a later date to pursue the sanctions.  \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 41 of 109\nDefendants argue that the first prong of the final agency action test is not met because \nSecretary Duffy’s purported termination of the VPPP Agreement “is part of a larger, unfolding \nadministrative  process  that  remains  incomplete.”    Dkt.  No. 118  at  14–18  (citing  Berkeley-\nDorchester Ctys. Econ. Dev. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., Admin. for Child. & \nFams., 2006 WL 8443181, at *1 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, 2006); Purpose Built Families Found., Inc. v. \nUnited States, 634 F. Supp. 3d 1118, 1121 (S.D. Fla. 2022), aff’d, 95 F.4th 1346 (11th Cir. 2024)).  \nDefendants point to the language in the April 21 Letter ordering the NYSDOT to show cause “why \nFHWA  should  not  take  appropriate  steps  under  23  CFR  §  1.36  to  remedy  New  York’s \nnoncompliance with 23 U.S.C. § 301 in connection with the [Tolling Program].”  Dkt. No. 87-10 \nat 1.  Defendants’ protestations fall flat.  The April 21 Letter cannot and does not magically convert \nthe Secretary’s February 19 declaration of termination into a mere tentative or preliminary view.   \nAt the outset, the April 21 Letter does not, by its terms, purport to rescind the February 19 \ntermination or resurrect the VPPP Agreement.  It reiterates that the VPPP Agreement has been \nterminated and states a definitive position that New York has “continue[d] to collect tolls in upon \ndefiance of federal law.”  Id. at 1.  It orders the NYSDOT to show cause why Defendants should \nnot “take appropriate steps . . . to remedy New York’s noncompliance,” with FAHA’s anti-tolling \nprovision, treating noncompliance itself as an established fact.  Even the portion of the April 21 \nLetter ordering NYSDOT to show cause does not indicate that the Secretary considers the matter \nof whether the VPPP Agreement should remain in place to be an open question.  It specifies that \nthe NYSDOT’s response must either “(1) certif[y] that the collection of tolls under the [Tolling \nProgram] has ceased; or (2) demonstrate[] that the continued collection of tolls does not violate \n23 U.S.C. § 301.”  Id.  In other words, New York must either cease operation of the Tolling \nProgram altogether, or else must continue the Tolling Program only in such a way that the \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 42 of 109\nSecretary would not find to violate Section 301—i.e., imposing tolls only on roads other than \nfederal-aid highways.55  Such an invitation for submission does not signal reconsideration.  The \nSecretary has never abandoned his view that, as a matter of law, the FHWA lacked and still lacks \nthe authority to enter the VPPP Agreement.    \nEven if the April 21 Letter was susceptible of the reading that the NYSDOT could submit \nmaterials showing that Congress gave the Secretary the power to enter the VPPP Agreement and \nthe Tolling Program was legally authorized pursuant to the VPPP, that would not be sufficient to \nmake his termination of the VPPP Agreement non-final.  See Sackett, 566 U.S. at 127 (“The mere \npossibility that an agency might reconsider in light of ‘informal discussion’ and invited contentions \nof  inaccuracy does not suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.”).  The \npossibility that an agency “may revise” its decision based on new information “is a common \ncharacteristic of agency action, and does not make an otherwise definitive decision nonfinal.”  U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 598 (2016); accord Nat’l Env’t Dev. Assoc.’s \nClean Air Project v. E.P.A., 752 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also S.F. Herring Ass’n v. \nDep’t of the Interior, 946 F.3d 564, 579 (9th Cir. 2019) (“[A] central rationale of the final agency \naction requirement is to prevent premature intrusion into the agency’s deliberations; it is not to \nrequire . . . parties to keep knocking at the agency’s door when the agency has already made its \nposition clear.”).  “Most, if not all, agency decisions incorporate some contingencies, but that is \n \n55 The February 19 Letter make clear that only ceasing tolling on federal-aid highways could \nconstitute “compliance” in light of the Secretary’s repeated conclusion that the VPPP could not \nauthorize tolling in connection with the Tolling Program.  See Dkt. No. 87-5 at 3–5 (stating that \nthe FHWA’s prior approval of the VPPP Agreement “was not authorized by law” as he explained \nthat “I have concluded that the scope of this pilot project as approved exceeds the authority \nauthorized by Congress under VPPP,” “I have concluded that Congress did not . . . authorize . . . \ncordon pricing,” and “I have concluded that VPPP does not authorize tolls that are calculated based \non considerations separate from reducing congestion or advancing other road-related goals.”).   \n \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 43 of 109\nnot enough to shield them from judicial review.”  Prutehi Litekyan: Save Ritidian v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAirforce, 128 F.4th 1089, 1109 (9th Cir. 2025).  The fact that Defendants might reconsider their \ndecision to terminate the VPPP does not mean that the decision has not been made.  And \nDefendants have not given any indication that the decision will be reconsidered. \nAn agency may not transform final decisions into nonfinal decisions and thereby forestall \njudicial review simply by creating an opportunity for “informal revision that offer[s] a mere \npossibility of success.”  6801 Realty Co., 719 F. App’x at 60 .  Instead, when determining whether \nan agency professing to have reopened a decision has actually rendered the original decision \nnonfinal,  courts  look  to  markers  of  sincerity  such  as  requests  for  more  evidence,  further \ninvestigation, or an admission that the earlier decision was deficient in some aspect that reopening \nmay allow the agency to remedy.  See Mantena v. Hazuda, 2018 WL 3745668, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. \nAug. 7, 2018) (collecting cases); see, e.g., 6801 Realty, 719 F. App’x at 60 (holding that the agency \naction was not final where the agency “actually reopened the decision and actively sought new \nevidence” and “identified issues with the original decision and areas that warranted further \nevidentiary development.”).  Where, as here, an agency identifies no issues with the original \ndecision and does not “request more evidence or set forth any way in which it would investigate \nfurther,” the agency has reopened the decision “in name only.”  Mantena, 2018 WL 3745668, at \n*6.  The April 21 Letter bears none of these markers of sincerity.  Defendants have not even \npurported to reconsider the decision to terminate the VPPP Agreement and have never wavered \nfrom the position that the FHWA’s prior execution of the VPPP Agreement was not authorized by \nthe law.  The Secretary and the Executive Director have stated, and continued to state, in no \nuncertain terms that the VPPP Agreement has been terminated.  And the President of the United \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 44 of 109\nStates,  whose  direction  the  Secretary  is  following,  see  Dkt.  No. 87-5  at  1–2,  has  declared \ndefinitively that congestion pricing is “dead,” Dkt. Nos. 87-2, 87-4.   \nIndeed, the timing and content of the April 21 Letter bespeak insincerity.  The letter was \nsent only after many months of litigation in which Defendants were exposed to Plaintiffs’ legal \narguments.  See Mantena, 2018 WL 3745668, at *6 (holding that “the circumstance of reopening \nare suspect” where the government’s decision to reopen the decision was made shortly after \nplaintiff filed her second amended complaint).  Defendants did not invite discussion on Plaintiffs’ \nreading of the VPPP before deciding and announcing in the February 19 Letter and again in the \nApril 21 Letter that the Tolling Program was unlawful.   Instead, they offered dialogue as a tack-\non to their threats of imminent punitive action if Plaintiffs did not cease tolling.  Defendants \nthreatened to pursue severe “compliance measures” against New York beginning just one week \nafter Plaintiffs’ submission is due.  There is no evidence that the Secretary is seriously considering \nwhether he erred as a matter of law in his conclusion that the VPPP does not give authority to \napprove the Tolling Program.  There is every reason to believe that any invitation to dialogue was \nconstructed as a post hoc effort simply to avoid judicial review before the Secretary could take the \npunitive actions he has long promised to take if Plaintiffs do not bow to the federal government’s \nwill and cease a program that the Secretary continues to characterize as unlawful.   \nDefendants’ cases are all distinguishable.  In Berkeley-Dorchester, the plaintiff challenged \nthe summary suspension of financial assistance under the Head Start program due to asbestos \nconcerns.  2006 WL 8443181, at *1.  The District of South Carolina held that no final agency \naction had occurred because the summary suspension was “a temporary action prompted by an \nemergency situation and anticipated to be resolved within a limited time frame.”  Id. at *16.  As \nfurther evidence of the interlocutory nature of the agency’s decision, the court noted that the \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 45 of 109\nagency “rescinded the summary suspension within days, upon Plaintiff’s production of adequate \nasbestos documentation as intended by the Head Start Regulations.”  Id.56  Similarly, in Purpose \nBuilt Fams., the plaintiff challenged an agency letter which stated that “the government will \nwithhold certain payments pending results of the government’s review of [plaintiff’s] grant \nactivities, and that the government will carry out an on-site review of [plaintiff’s] facility.”  634 F. \nSupp. 3d at 1123–24.  The Southern District of Florida held that the suspension was therefore, by \nits own terms merely “a preliminary measure, pending completion of the government’s audit.”  Id. \nat 1124.  Tellingly, Defendants cite no case in which a cabinet secretary and a president of the \nUnited States have declared in no uncertain terms that an administrative approval has been \nrescinded but yet a court determined that such action is not ripe for review.     \nWith regard to the second prong, Defendants argue that no tangible legal consequences \nhave yet flowed from the FHWA’s and Secretary’s actions.  Dkt. No. 118 at 18–20; see Alaska \nDep’t of Env’t Conservation v. E.P.A., 540 U.S. 461, 483 (2004) (a final action “must either \ndetermine ‘rights or obligations’ or occasion ‘legal consequences’” (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at \n178)).  But that misstates the impact of Defendants’ February 19 pronouncement that the FHWA \nwas revoking Plaintiffs’ ability to charge tolls.  The Secretary does not suggest that Plaintiffs are \nfree to disregard his order.  The February 19 Letter stated the agency’s conclusions of law, deemed \nthe VPPP Agreement to have been unauthorized, and on its face terminated and rescinded the \nVPPP Agreement.  The order, if valid, imposes a “legal obligation” upon Plaintiff to cease \noperation of the Tolling Program and, as the Secretary’s own letters confirm, puts Plaintiffs at risk \nof legal sanctions.  See Sackett, 566 U.S. at 126 & n.2 (agency action was final where, “according \nto the Government’s current litigating position, the order expose[d]” the plaintiffs to penalties in a \n \n56 Berkeley-Dorchester was also decided prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sacket. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 46 of 109\npotential future enforcement proceeding); Tzumi Innovations LLC v. Regan, 557 F. Supp. 3d 499, \n507 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (“Legal consequences also flow from the Letter because it put Plaintiff in the \nposition of complying with EPA’s costly recall demand or risking enforcement action at some \nuncertain point in the future.”); CSI Aviation Servs., 637 F.3d at 412.  In addition, the Secretary’s \npronouncement has endangered Plaintiffs’ ability to issue bonds as the bonds are secured by the \nTolling Program’s revenues and thus rely upon the program’s longevity.  Dkt. No. 84 ¶¶ 10–11. \nPlaintiffs adequately demonstrate that the April 19 Letter is a final agency action. \nb.

Gardner, 387 U.S. 158, 162 (1967) (holding that a legal challenge to a \nregulation was not ripe despite the fact that the regulation was a final agency action).  “In the \nadministrative  context,  the  ripeness  doctrine  ‘prevent[s]  the  courts,  through  avoidance  of \npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative \npolicies, and also . . . protect[s] the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative \ndecision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.’”  \nLacewell v.

Accordingly, the fitness analysis requires “consideration of a variety \nof pragmatic factors: whether the agency’s actions or inactions challenged in the law suit are \n‘final;’ whether the issues presented for review are primarily legal as opposed to factual in nature; \nand whether administrative remedies have been exhausted at least to the extent that an adequate \nfactual record has been established.”  Seafarers Int’l Union v.

Dkt. No. 118 at 21–23.  However, for the reasons stated above \nwith regard to Defendants’ arguments concerning final agency action, Defendants fail to show that \nthe ongoing administrative process is anything more than lip service meant to avoid judicial \nintervention.  The action is thus final and the administrative remedies have been sufficiently \nexhausted—an agency cannot perpetually put off litigation by inviting opportunities to submit \nmaterials where there is no indication that any submission would change the agency’s course of \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 48 of 109\naction.

Supp. 2d at 506 (finding challenge to registration requirements \nfor outdoor advertising companies ripe even where the government had not completed its review \nof the plaintiff’s applications because the rule is final and “[t]here is no indication that it will \nundergo any further revision”).     \nThe issues to be decided are legal ones concerning the lawfulness of the VPPP Agreement \nand the FHWA’s authority to sign it or to terminate it.  The Secretary has taken the definitive views \nthat federal law did not permit the FHWA to sign the VPPP Agreement and that he has the authority \nto terminate the VPPP Agreement.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that, if the VPPP did not authorize the \nFHWA to enter into the VPPP Agreement, then New York may not toll federal-aid highways in \nconnection with the Tolling Program.  The Court does not need any further administrative review \nbefore it reads the statute and decides whether the Secretary’s reading is correct or not.  Cf. Loper \nBright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nFinally,  while  Defendants  assert  that  Plaintiffs’  challenge  for  arbitrariness  and \ncapriciousness is a fact-intensive one, Dkt.

Nos. 83–87, 89–91, 114–116, 118, 124–126.  “[I]ssues have \nbeen deemed ripe when they would not benefit from any further factual development and when \nthe court would be in no better position to adjudicate the issues in the future than it is now.”  \nGrandeau, 528 F.3d at 132 (quoting Simmonds, 326 F.3d at 359).  But the issues here need no \nfurther factual development and raise square questions of law.  Defendants identify no questions \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 49 of 109\nof fact yet to be developed that would bear on the VPPP Agreement’s lawfulness or the Secretary’s \nright to end it. 57  \nFor the same reasons Plaintiffs have established irreparable harm, see infra, Plaintiffs have \nshown that they will face a direct and immediate dilemma without a decision.  See Nat’l Org. for \nMarriage, Inc. v. Walsh, 714 F.3d 682, 691 (2d Cir. 2013).  “A rule that ‘requires an immediate \nand significant change in [a party’s] conduct of its affairs with serious penalties attached to \nnoncompliance’ presents a prototypical instance of hardship.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Servs., 414 F. Supp. 3d 475, 565 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting Abbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S. 136, 153 (1967)).  “Where ‘plaintiffs must either incur great expense to comply with [a \nregulation’s] requirements’ or risk ‘potentially even greater’ consequences for non-compliance, \nthey will suffer hardship if the court foregoes review.”  Id. (quoting Thomas v. City of New York, \n143 F.3d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 1998)). \nPlaintiffs  adequately  show  that  their  claim  that  Defendants  acted  arbitrarily  and \ncapriciously is ripe for review at this time. \nc.  Tucker Act \nThe APA “permits a party to bring an equitable claim challenging arbitrary and capricious \naction of an administrative agency in federal district court and waives the government’s sovereign \nimmunity with respect to such claims in that forum.”  Up State Fed. Credit Union v. Walker, 198 \nF.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam); accord Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398, \n406 (2d Cir. 2015).  However, the APA specifies that “[n]othing herein . . . confers authority to \ngrant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief \nwhich is sought.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The Tucker Act “waives sovereign immunity for contract \n \n57 Notably, Defendants did not submit a declaration or any exhibits in opposition to the preliminary \ninjunction motions—underscoring the conclusion that the issues are legal rather than factual. \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 50 of 109\ndisputes with the government and gives the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over \nsuch actions.”  Up State, 198 F.3d at 374 (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(a)(2), 1491(a)(1)).  It \n“impliedly forbids relief other than remedies provided by the Court of Federal Claims for actions \nthat arise out of a contract with the United States.”  Id. at 375 (quotation and alterations omitted); \nsee Presidential Gardens Assocs. v. United States ex rel. Sec’y of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 175 F.3d \n132, 143 (2d Cir. 1999).   \nThe parties dispute whether the instant suit is a contract action falling under the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.  Dkt. No. 83 at 22; Dkt. No. 118 at 26–28; Dkt. No. 124 \nat 8–10; Dkt. No. 126 at 2–2.  “[T]he determination of whether an action is at its essence a contract \naction for purposes of sovereign immunity under the Tucker Act depends both on the source of the \nrights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought.”  Up State, 198 \nF.3d at 375 (quotation omitted); accord Atterbury, 805 F.3d at 406; Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 \nF.2d 959 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \nThe Second Circuit has held that even where a plaintiff styles its claim as an APA claim \nrather than a contractual claim, the Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims exclusive \njurisdiction where the rights to be enforced exist only in contract.  See, e.g., Up State, 198 F.3d at \n377 (holding that the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claim that \nthe army violated an agreement to assume the title to a building); Presidential Gardens, 175 F.3d \nat 143 (holding that the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claim \nthat was “in essence” seeking specific performance of a settlement agreement).  Conversely, the \nmere fact that a contract is involved does not divest the district court of jurisdiction.  See, e.g., \nAtterbury, 805 F.3d at 406–07 (holding that the district court retained jurisdiction where the \nplaintiff argued that he had a constitutionally-protected property interest in continued employment \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 51 of 109\ndespite a federal contract that gave the United States Marshall Service the right to dismiss him); \nNoble Energy, Inc. v. Salazar, 770 F. Supp. 2d 322, 328–29 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding that the \nplaintiff’s “question falls squarely within the scope of APA review” where plaintiff challenges the \nscope of an agency’s authority to take an action and “does not seek to enforce its rights under the \nterms of [a relevant lease agreement], nor does it ask this Court to determine whether the federal \ngovernment violated its contractual obligations”), vacated on other grounds, 671 F.3d 1241 (D.C. \nCir. 2012). \nThe core of Plaintiffs’ claim is that the Secretary acted unlawfully in purporting to \nterminate the VPPP Agreement and announcing that the FHWA would withhold federal funding \nor authorizations if Plaintiffs did not comply.  Plaintiffs are not suing to enforce any term of the \nVPPP Agreement or accusing Defendants of breach.58  Furthermore, the relief Plaintiffs seek is \nnon-contractual.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to set aside Defendants’ decision to rescind Plaintiffs’ \nauthority to toll federal aid-highways as arbitrary and capricious in light of the VPPP’s statutory \nscheme and to enjoin Defendants from sanctioning New York on the basis of that rescission as \nultra vires.  SCAC at 117.  In asking the Court to enjoin Defendants from pursuing the threatened \n“compliance measures,” Plaintiffs do not cite any contractual rights arising wholly from the VPPP \nAgreement but rather statutory entitlements—federal funding and approvals guaranteed by federal \nlaws such as the FAHA, NEPA, and the Federal Transit Act that do not derive from any contract.  \nDkt. No. 83 ¶¶ 7–9, 44–47. \n \n58 The VPPP Agreement imposes obligations on the Project Sponsors.  The only obligation it \nimposes on Defendants is that “[i]n order to carry out Section 1012(b)(5) of ISTEA, as amended, \nthe  FHWA  and  NYSDOT,  TBTA  and  NYCDOT  will  cooperate  and  work  together  in  the \nimplementation of the Project.”  Dkt. No. 87-1 § 8(a).  Plaintiffs do not sue to enforce that provision \nof the VPPP Agreement. \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 52 of 109\nAlthough  Defendants  characterize  Plaintiffs’  claims  as  seeking  reinstatement  of  the \nterminated agreement which Defendants construe as a claim for specific performance, Dkt. \nNo. 118 at 28, “the mere fact that an injunction would require the same governmental restraint that \nspecific (non)performance might require in a contract setting is an insufficient basis to deny a \ndistrict court the jurisdiction otherwise available,” Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971.  Plaintiffs are \nbetter understood as arguing that Defendants’ acts are unauthorized by any law or other source of \nauthority  including  the  VPPP  Agreement  and  therefore  that  the  VPPP  Agreement  remains \nunchanged by Defendants’ arbitrary and capricious conduct.  See Climate United Fund v. Citibank, \nN.A. (“Climate United Fund I”), 2025 WL 842360, at *6 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025) (holding that the \nCourt of Federal Claims did not have exclusive jurisdiction over action challenging the termination \nof a federal award because “Plaintiffs do not challenge a contract between the parties—they \nchallenge an action”); Md. Dep’t of Hum. Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, \n1449 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that the Court of Federal Claims did not have exclusive jurisdiction \nwhere the plaintiff’s “claims arise under a federal grant program and turn on the interpretation of \nstatutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the \nparties”).    The Court need not pass judgment on the interpretation of any term of the VPPP \nAgreement.  The essence of Plaintiffs’ claims requires the Court to review the VPPP Agreement \nonly to determine what it does not say.   \nThus, “[w]hile the Court here may need to pass on certain questions about a contract, . . . \nit would do so in the context of the Government’s defense of the action, not Plaintiff’s independent \nrequests for relief.”  Hall v. Nielsen, 2019 WL 250972, at *3 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2019), aff’d sub \nnom. Hall v. McAleenan, 2019 WL 5394627 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 3, 2019); see also Normandy Apts., \nLtd. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb.

Servs., 2025 WL 1393876, at *2 (9th Cir. May 14, 2025).   \nThis Court under the APA, not the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act, has the authority \nto review the relevant statutes and regulations and to determine whether the Secretary’s actions \nare lawful or not.  See id. (“Seeking to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory commands \nis a matter beyond the scope of the Tucker Act’s exclusive jurisdiction.”); Lawrence v. Lew, 156 \nF. Supp. 3d 149, 168 (D.D.C. 2016) (Brown-Jackson, J.) (holding that the district court retains \njurisdiction where the contract at issue incorporates substantive provisions of federal law such that \nenforcement requires the interpretation and application of federal law).  This is not a case in which \nthe terms and conditions of some individual grant are at issue such that Plaintiffs seek an order “to \nenforce a contractual obligation to pay money.”  Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 \n(2025) (holding that the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over claims seeking an \norder where the terms and conditions of individual grants were at issue) (citation omitted)); but \nsee New York v.

See VPPP \ncl. 1 (providing that “[t]he Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements . . . to establish, \nmaintain,  and  monitor  value  pricing  programs”  (emphasis  added));  31 U.S.C.  § 6305.59  \nCooperative agreements by which the federal government transfers something of value to a state \nor local government to achieve a joint public purpose “generally do not confer a ‘direct’ and \n‘tangible’ benefit on the United States—a requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction.”  Pacito v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 893530, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025) (collecting cases); see Am. Near E. \nRefugee Aid v. U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev., 703 F. Supp. 3d 126, 134 (D.D.C. 2023) (“Because the \nCooperative Agreement did not confer a direct benefit on [the agency], the consideration leg of \nthe chair is missing, and [the agency]’s argument that the Claims Court has jurisdiction topples \nover.”).  So too here, the VPPP Agreement memorializes the federal government’s authorization \nto toll federal-aid highways for the mutual purpose of reducing congestion, increasing transit \n \n59 Congress provided in 31 U.S.C. § 6305 that: \n \nAn executive agency shall use a cooperative agreement as the legal instrument \nreflecting a relationship between the United States Government and a State, a local \ngovernment, or other recipient when— \n(1) the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the \nState, local government, or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support \nor stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead of acquiring (by \npurchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the \nUnited States Government; and \n(2) substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, \nlocal government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in \nthe agreement. \nId. \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 55 of 109\nridership, and addressing air quality.  Dkt. No.87-1 at 9 (performance metrics).  It identifies no \nexchanged consideration.  In effect, the VPPP Agreement acts “only as a vehicle” to convey \ncongressionally permitted authorization.  RFE/RL, Inc. v. Lake, 2025 WL 1232863, at *4 (D.D.C. \nApr. 29, 2025) (holding that the Tucker Act did not divest the district court of jurisdiction because \nthe grant agreement was “involved only as a vehicle to distribute congressionally appropriated \nfunds  because  Congress  requires  [the  agency]  to  transmit  funds  to  RFE/RL  that  way.”).  \nDefendants do not identify any direct benefit the VPPP Agreement bestowed upon the federal \ngovernment, thus bringing any claims based upon the agreement (which Plaintiffs’ claims are not) \noutside the ambit of the Tucker Act.     \nThe Tucker Act does not divest this Court of jurisdiction. \n2.  Arbitrariness and Capriciousness  \nThe APA serves as a “check upon administrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried \nthem to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.”  United States v. Morton \nSalt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950).  Under the APA, the “reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions” that are found to be: (1) “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” (2) “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” and/or (3) “without \nobservance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C)–(D); see Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil v. U.S. E.P.A., 658 F.3d 200, 215 (2d Cir. 2011).   \nAccording to Plaintiffs, “[t]he February 19 Letter, which serves as the purported basis for \nDefendants’ actions, is entirely inconsistent with the statutory scheme it seeks to enforce, and \narbitrarily announces an atextual interpretation of the FAHA in violation of the APA.”  Dkt. No. 83 \nat 24.  Plaintiffs advance several arguments as to why the Court should find that the February 19 \nLetter violated the APA.  First, Plaintiffs argue that Secretary Duffy and the FHWA had no \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 56 of 109\nauthority to terminate the VPPP Agreement without Plaintiffs’ consent.  Id. at 34–36.  Next, \nassuming that the Secretary had the authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement, Plaintiffs take \nissue with several of the Secretary’s expressed legal and policy bases for termination.  Plaintiffs \nargue that the February 19 Letter exemplifies arbitrary and capricious agency action because it \nwas based on the mistaken legal premise that the FHWA did not have the authority to permit \ncordon pricing programs or toll rates reflective of non-congestion related goals pursuant to the \nVPPP.  Id. at 24–32.  Plaintiffs further argue that Defendants’ attempt in their memorandum of \nlaw in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction to reframe those legal conclusions as \npolicy concerns is an attempt at “impermissible post hoc rationalization[].”  Id. at 32 (quoting \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 21–22 (2020)).  Plaintiffs \nadditionally argue that the Secretary failed to adequately consider the MTA’s and TBTA’s \nsignificant reliance interests in the VPPP Agreement, the FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of \nthe VPPP, or the history of the FHWA’s interactions with the Project Sponsors, including the 2019 \nstatement that the VPPP is the “best fit” for the Program.  Id. at 38–42; see Regents of the Univ. of \nCal., 591 U.S. at 16 (a court reviewing an agency action assesses whether the decision was “based \non a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment” \n(quoting Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971))).  They also \nclaim Defendants arbitrarily and capriciously failed to conduct an environmental review under \nNEPA.  Dkt. No. 83 at 36–38.  In response, Defendants argue that the Secretary and FHWA have \nauthority to terminate the VPPP Agreement and properly made the termination decision on the \nbasis of the Tolling Program’s cordon pricing model and toll rates after considering Plaintiffs’ \nreliance interests, though in large part Defendants reframe those considerations as policy concerns \nrather than conclusions of the VPPP Agreement’s illegality.  Dkt. No. 118 at 36–49.  Defendants \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 57 of 109\nalso argue that the FHWA was not required to conduct a new NEPA review before terminating the \nVPPP Agreement.  Id. at 49–51. \na.  Authority to Terminate \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants simply “do not have the right to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 34–36.  An agency can take only such actions as Congress has enabled \nit to take.  Under the APA therefore, a reviewing court must set aside agency actions that exceed \nthe agency’s delegated authority.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, 2020 WL \n7121849, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2020); see also Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94, 108 (1902) (noting that the acts of administrative officers “must be justified by some \nlaw, and in case an official violates the law to the injury of an individual the courts generally have \njurisdiction to grant relief”).  Plaintiffs note that “the VPPP Agreement itself says nothing about \nDefendants having a right to terminate.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 34.  According to Plaintiffs, the lack of an \nexpress termination right on the part of the federal government reflects the parties’ understanding \nthat the federal government did not have an unfettered unilateral right to terminate the VPPP \nAgreement.  Id. (citing Dkt. No. 87-1). \nFederal agencies are required to “clearly and unambiguously specify all termination \nprovisions  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Federal  award.”    2 C.F.R.  § 200.340(b).  \nSection 200.340(a) states four ways in which a federal award may be terminated in part or in its \nentirety: \n(1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the recipient or subrecipient fails \nto comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; \n(2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the recipient \nor subrecipient, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination \nconditions . . .; \n(3) By the recipient or subrecipient upon sending the Federal agency or pass-\nthrough  entity  a  written  notification  of  the  reasons  for  such  termination,  the \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 58 of 109\neffective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.  \nHowever,  if  the  Federal  agency  or  pass-through  entity  determines  that  the \nremaining portion of the Federal award will not accomplish the purposes for which \nthe Federal award was made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may \nterminate the Federal award in its entirety; or \n(4)  By  the  Federal  agency  or  pass-through  entity  pursuant  to  the  terms  and \nconditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an \naward no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. \nId. § 200.340(a).   \nThus,  under  Section  200.340(a),  a  federal  award  may  be  terminated  by  the  federal \ngovernment only under one of three circumstances: (1) if the recipient fails to comply with the \naward’s terms and conditions; (2) if the recipient consents to termination, or (3) the terms and \nconditions of the federal award permit the federal government to terminate the award on other \ngrounds including, to the extent authorized by law, if the award ceases to effectuate program goals \nor agency priorities.  See id.  Only the recipient or subrecipient has the unfettered discretion to \nterminate an award.  In the event of the termination of the award in its entirety, it need only send \nnotice  of  the  termination  with  the  reasons  for  the  termination  and  its  effective  date.    Id. \n§ 200.340(a)(3). \n The regulation serves to effectuate the purpose of federal awards.  As the Tolling Program \nitself illustrates, capital projects invariably involve substantial investment of time and resources.  \nTo build a highway or building, plans must be made, employees must be hired, supplies must be \npurchased, and monies must be raised.  The federal government can reserve to itself the right to \nterminate an award and to deprive the award recipient of the value of that investment, but to do so \nit must set forth the terms and conditions upon which it will terminate the award when the award \nis granted and before the investment is made.  In the absence of any such reservation, the award \nrecipient and those who invest their time and resources on the award grant are entitled to rely upon \nit and to presume that the award will be rescinded only if the award recipient or subrecipient fails \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 59 of 109\nto comply with the terms and conditions stated in the award.  Few if any persons would buy bonds \nto support a capital project were the rule otherwise.   \nDefendants do not argue that Plaintiffs failed to comply with any term or condition of the \nVPPP Agreement, and Plaintiffs have not terminated the VPPP Agreement and vehemently do not \nconsent to termination.  Therefore, termination is not permitted under subsections (1), (2), or (3) \nof Section 200.340(a).  This leaves termination in accordance with a term or condition of the VPPP \nAgreement under subsection 200.340(a)(4).  But the VPPP Agreement contains no language giving \nthe federal government the right to terminate the agreement.  Dkt. No. 87-1.  Rather, the only \nprovision that speaks to termination is one that contemplates the possibility that the Project \nSponsors will decide to terminate the Project.  It states that “NYSDOT, TBTA and NYCDOT \nagree that they will work with FHWA to return the Project to its original operating condition if \nTBTA decides to discontinue tolls on the Project.”  Id. at 4.  In the absence of agreement by the \nProject Sponsors, the VPPP Agreement can be terminated only if the Project Sponsors fail to \ncomply with a term and condition of the VPPP Agreement.   \nDefendants respond that a different federal regulation, 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(c)(2) provides \nthat an award must “incorporate, by reference, all general terms and conditions of the Federal \naward, which must be maintained on the Federal agency’s website,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(c)(2), and \nthat the FHWA’s Contractors & Recipients General Terms and Conditions for Assistance Awards \n(“T&C”), were available on the FHWA’s website.  Dkt. No. 18 at 36.60  But those T&C do not do \nthe work that the Defendants would need them to do.  They do not contain any express termination \nprovision.  They merely refer back to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 and state that “[t]his Agreement may be \n \n60 See Contractors & Recipients General Terms and Conditions for Assistance Awards, FHWA \n(Aug. 2, 2023), https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/cfo/contractor_recip/gtandc_after2023aug07.cfm.   \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 60 of 109\nterminated or suspended in whole or in part, at any time prior to its expiration date in accordance \nwith 2 CFR 200.340.”  T&C § 17.  If Section 200.340 does not give the Secretary the unilateral \nright to terminate the VPPP Agreement in the absence of a violation by the Project Sponsors of \none of the terms of that agreement, Section 200.211(c)(2) and the T&C do not give Defendants \nthat right.     \nDefendants also argue that the fourth of Section 200.340(a)’s termination mechanisms \nrequires all federal awards to permit termination based on a change of agency priorities.  Dkt. \nNo. 118 at 37.  But Defendants’ reading of Section 200.340(a)(4), which would undermine the \nsecurity of all federal awards, is at odds with the plain meaning of its text.  The regulation is \nproperly read as stating that an award may be terminated on the ground that it no longer effectuates \nthe program goals or agency priorities only if such a ground (1) is authorized by law and (2) is \nactually included as a term and condition of the federal award.  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); accord \nClimate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A. (“Climate United Fund II”), 2025 WL 1131412, at *16 \n(D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2025) (holding that the regulation’s plain language states that the agency “can \nonly terminate a federal award on this basis pursuant to the terms and conditions of the federal \naward”).    In  other  words,  Section 200.340  does  not  create  a  default  ability  by  the  federal \ngovernment to terminate an award over the award recipient’s objection, whenever an agency \ndetermines its priorities have changed.  It requires a change in agency priorities to be set forth as \na term and condition if the agency wishes to reserve to itself the right to rescind the award based \non a change in priority.     \nCourts interpret regulations by looking to the regulation’s plain meaning as determined by \nthe specific context in which the language is used and the broader context of the regulation as a \nwhole.  See United States v. Rowland, 826 F.3d 100, 108 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Yates v. United \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 61 of 109\nStates, 574 U.S. 528, 528 (2015) (plurality opinion)); accord Rock of Ages Corp. v. Sec’y of Lab., \n170 F.3d 148, 155 (2d Cir. 1999).  The language of subsection 200.340(a)(4), both in isolation and \nin context, requires the agency to state upfront in an award that it may terminate the award based \non change in priority or goals, if it wishes to have the ability to exercise that termination in the \nabsence of consent.   \nIn isolation, subsection (a)(4) provides that the federal agency may terminate an award in \npart or in its entirety “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the \nextent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  The reference to the “terms and conditions of the Federal award,” as \nwell as the use of the word “including” is telling.  It signifies that the test following the term \ndescribes subsets of the preceding text. See Carroll v. Trump, 49 F.4th 759, 768 (2d Cir. 2022); \nsee also Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 162 (2012) (subsequent history \nomitted) (explaining that the use of the term “includes” indicates that the text following the term \ndescribes subsets of the preceding text (citing Burgess v. United States, 553 U.S. 124, 131, n.3, \n(2008)).  Defendants’ reading renders the phrase “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the \nFederal award,” superfluous.  See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979) (“In \nconstruing a statute [courts] are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.”).  \nThey would have the subsection improbably read “to the extent authorized by law, if the award no \nlonger effectuates the program goals or agency priorities, excepted as prohibited by the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award.” \nIn context, the only interpretation that makes sense and gives meaning to all of the terms \nand provisions of Section 200.340 is that a change in agency priorities or goals must be stated in \nthe terms and conditions of the award if it is to provide a basis for unilateral termination of the \n61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 62 of 109\naward.  The regulation by its terms provides the Federal agency only a limited right to terminate \nan award over the objection of the award recipient—the recipient or subrecipient must have \nviolated the terms and conditions of the award.  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a).  In the absence of such \nviolation, the federal agency must have reached advance agreement with the award recipient to \npermit termination by the federal agency and must have “clearly and unambiguously specif[ied] \n[such]  termination  provisions  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Federal  award.”    Id. \n§ 200.340(a)(4), (b).  Those provisions, and the security of contract they provide, would be \nrendered  virtually  illusory  if,  in  the  absence  of  some  contractually  agreed  upon  basis  for \ntermination, an agency could at any time terminate an award based upon some open-ended and \nunspecified change in the agency’s priorities or its goals. \nFinally, the OMB’s most recent guidance also clarifies that the term and condition stating \ntermination could be predicated upon ceased effectuation of program goals or agency priorities is \nan optional term agencies may choose to include in the award rather than a default provision \nagencies  can  exclude  only  through  express  waiver.    See  Guidance  for  Federal  Financial \nAssistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 (Apr. 22, 2024) (explaining that pursuant to the regulation, \nan agency “may include a term and condition allowing termination by the Federal agency or pass-\nthrough entity, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals \nor agency priorities”).   \nUltimately, Section 200.340(a)(4) does not itself clearly and unambiguously specify a \nmechanism by which Defendants may terminate the VPPP Agreement.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b).  \nIt merely stands for the uncontroversial proposition that an agency may terminate an award in \naccordance with an express term or condition of the award that permits it to do so and “establishes \na boundary to ensure that when dealing with federal awards, no agency exceeds the legal authority \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 63 of 109\ngranted to them.”  Climate United Fund II, 2025 WL 1131412; see also Climate United Fund I, \n2025 WL 842360, at *7.  It does not give the Secretary the authority to terminate the Agreement \nover the objection of the Project Sponsors and in the absence of the violation of a term and \ncondition.   \nDefendants alternatively argue that “[e]ven if this Court were to find that the Agreement \ndid not expressly incorporate the termination clause of FHWA’s general terms and conditions, the \nclause would still be included by operation of law under the Christian doctrine.”  Dkt. No. 118 at \n37 (citing Aerolease Long Beach v. United States, 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 374 (1994)).  “[U]nder the \nChristian doctrine, a court may insert a clause into a government contract by operation of law if \nthat clause is required under applicable federal administrative regulations.”  K-Con, Inc. v. Sec’y \nof Army, 908 F.3d 719, 724 (Fed. Cir. 2018); see G. L. Christian & Assocs. v. United States, 312 \nF.2d 418, 427 (Ct. Cl. 1963).  The doctrine’s namesake provides a helpful illustration.  In G. L. \nChristian, the relevant section of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations provided that ‘“the \nfollowing standard clause shall be inserted in all fixed-price construction contracts amounting to \nmore than $1,000,’ and then proceeded to prescribe a detailed termination clause.”  312 F.2d at \n424.  Therefore, although the government entered into a contract that did not contain the required \ntermination clause, the Court of Claims held that “there was a legal requirement that the plaintiff’s \ncontract contain the standard termination clause and the contract must be read as if it did.”  Id.  \n“Accordingly, the Christian Doctrine applies to mandatory contract clauses which express a \nsignificant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy.”  Gen. Eng’g & Mach. Works \nv. O’Keefe, 991 F.2d 775, 779–80 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (collecting cases); accord K-Con, 908 F.3d at \n724 (“For a court to incorporate a clause into a contract under the Christian doctrine, it generally \n63 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 64 of 109\nmust find (1) that the clause is mandatory; and (2) that it expresses a significant or deeply ingrained \nstrand of public procurement policy.”).   \nAs stated, Section 200.340(a)(4) does not set forth a mandatory contract clause.  It is \npermissive, allowing but not requiring, the federal agency to include in the award a term stating \nthat the award can be terminated if agency priorities or goals have changed.  It therefore cannot \nserve as the basis for application of the Christian doctrine.  See Idir, Inc. v. Postal Serv., 1984 WL \n543, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 25, 1984) (Leval, J.) (holding that the Christian doctrine did not imply \na clause permitting termination for convenience because “the regulation . . . does not require a \ntermination for convenience clause; it merely authorizes a form in the event such a term is to be \nincluded”).  The doctrine is additionally inapplicable on the ground that the VPPP Agreement is \nnot a procurement contract.  See Earman v. United States, 114 Fed. Cl. 81, 112 (2013) (holding \nthat “the Christian doctrine is not applicable to this case” because the contract “involves financial \nassistance agreements, not procurement contracts”), aff’d, 589 F. App’x 991 (Fed. Cir. 2015); see \nalso Mktg. & Mgmt. Info., Inc. v. United States, 57 Fed. Cl. 665, 674 (2003).61 \nDefendants further argue that they necessarily have the unilateral authority to terminate \nVPPP agreements based on agency priorities because the VPPP caps the number of value pricing \npilot projects the Secretary may approve at fifteen.  In the absence of such right to terminate an \nagreement, they argue, one presidential administration can limit the number of pilot projects a \nfuture administration can approve.  See Dkt. No. 118 at 39 (“Without such authority, the federal \ngovernment could be locked into just 15 ongoing pilot projects indefinitely, preventing other states \nor local governments from participating in the program.”).  That argument is nonsensical.  It is true \n \n61 Plaintiffs also correctly point out that “[t]he Second Circuit has never recognized the Christian \ndoctrine.”  Dkt. No. 124 at 18 n.16.  Idir appears to be the doctrine’s only mention by any court in \nthis Circuit. \n64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 65 of 109\nthat the VPPP limits the number of value pricing projects to fifteen.  It is thus axiomatic that each \nproject that the Secretary authorizes during one presidential administration means that there will \nbe one less project that, absent congressional legislation, can be authorized during a subsequent \nadministration.62  But that does not mean that each project is term limited so that it expires once a \nnew president is elected.   \nThrough the ISTEA, Congress intended the Secretary to authorize pilot projects.  Congress \ndirected the Secretary of Transportation to “solicit the participation of State and local governments \nand public authorities for one or more congestion pricing pilot projects.”  Id. § 1012(b).  It \npermitted the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with as many as five such state or \nlocal governments or public authorities to establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing \nprojects,” and then directed the Secretary to “allow the use of tolls on the Interstate System as part \nof a pilot program under this section, but not on more than 3 of such programs.”  Id.  TEA-21C \nexpanded the total number of projects to 15 and directed the Secretary to allow the use of tolling \non “any value pricing pilot program under this subsection.”  Pub. L. No. 105-178, § 1216(a)(2).  \nDefendants’ argument, if accepted, has built within it the seeds of the destruction of the VPPP and \nthe objectives Congress intended to further with it.  The current Secretary has stated that it is the \npriority of the current Administration to “prioritize tolling projects under the VPPP that provide \nfor toll-free alternative routes and set tolls with the aim of reducing congestion and/or raising \nrevenues primarily for highway infrastructure.”  Dkt. No. 87-10 at 4.63  But, if his argument is \naccepted, few, if any, state or local governments will apply for and invest in such projects because \n \n62 Congress had shown itself willing to address the scarcity of VPPP slots by creating more \nopenings rather than withdrawing approval for existing projects.  When Congress passed the TEA-\n21C, it tripled the number of value pricing pilot projects the Secretary could authorize.  See Pub. \nL. No. 105-178, § 1216(a)(2).   \n63 ECF pagination. \n65 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 66 of 109\nnone of them could be secure that the award that they have given will not be revoked and the \ninvestment lost based on the next administration’s alternative priorities.  Properly read, the VPPP \npermits the Secretary to authorize up to fifteen pilot projects; not fifteen term-limited pilot projects \nper presidential administration.  Congress did not limit the length of the pilot projects but rather \nleft it to the parties to set a termination date or provision.   \nIn a single, unsupported sentence later in Defendants’ memorandum of law, Defendants \nargue that the “[t]he Secretary’s decision to terminate the Agreement, is consistent with the statute \nthat permits the Secretary to take mitigation efforts to protect low-income drivers.”  Dkt. No. 118 \nat 45 (citing VPPP cl. 7).  But that statutory clause merely states that “[a]ny value pricing pilot \nprogram . . . shall include, if appropriate, an analysis of the potential effects of the pilot program \non low-income drivers and may include mitigation measures to deal with any potential adverse \nfinancial effects on low-income drivers.”  VPPP cl. 7.  And indeed, the Tolling Program did include \nan analysis of the potential effect on low-income drivers (which found such effect to be either \nminimal or beneficial) as well as mitigation measures to reduce to tolling burden on low-income \ndrivers.64  And, if the FHWA wished there to be additional provisions and terms and conditions \nwith respect to low-income drivers, it could have asked that they be included in the VPPP \nAgreement’s terms and conditions.  It did not. The VPPP does not authorize the Secretary to \nunilaterally add mitigation measures after the program’s implementation, let alone to terminate the \nprogram entirely. \n \n64 See Final EA Chapter 6, Economic Conditions; N.Y. Tax Law § 606(jjj); supra § II.B.2 \ndiscussing the Low-Income Discount Plan and the Individual Disability Exemption Plan); see also  \nDkt. No. 91-2 at 9–10 (explaining that the Tolling Program is intended to benefit low-income \nindividuals who are disproportionately non-drivers reliant upon public transit options). \n66 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 67 of 109\nPlaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their argument that the \nFebruary 19  Letter  exceeded  the  FHWA  or  Secretary’s  authority  to  terminate  the  VPPP \nAgreement. \nb.  Cordon Pricing \nEven if the FHWA or Secretary had the authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement, \nPlaintiffs argue that the decision to terminate was arbitrary and capricious because it was based on \nthe erroneous legal conclusion that the VPPP does not give the Secretary authority to permit states \nto toll federal-aid highways as part of a cordon-pricing program.  Dkt. No. 83 at 24–29.  In his \nFebruary 19 Letter, the Secretary expressed the view that the only programs Congress authorized \nhim to approve were projects that permitted a toll-free option for travelers.  Dkt. No. 87-5 at 4.    \nIn opposing the preliminary injunction motions, Defendants do not offer a full-throated \ndefense for that argument, instead contending weakly that the “deficiencies” related to the Tolling \nProgram’s cordon pricing model “rise to the level of a statutory problem and render the project \nineligible under the VPPP statute.”  Dkt. No. 118 at 45.  Defendants otherwise attempting to \nreframe the termination decision as being based not on a lack of authority to permit cordon pricing \nbut on shifting agency priorities.  Id. at 42–44.65  However, the Secretary’s February 19 Letter is \nnot based on policy considerations but on his misconstruction of the VPPP statute.  The Secretary’s \nexplanation of the VPPP’s supposed exclusion of cordon pricing programs rests on two erroneous \nlegal conclusions: first that he was required to adopt a narrow construction of the VPPP’s tolling \n \n65 Defendants’ attempt to reframe this legal conclusion as an expression of the agency’s shifted \npolicy priorities is unavailing for the reasons stated infra, § IV.A.2.d.  The Court may not accept \nDefendants’ “post hoc rationalizations for agency action.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983); accord Pub.

Dkt. No. 87-5 at 4.  That “understanding” is not \nsupported by the law.   \nIt is true that, as a general matter, Congress requires that roads built with federal funds be \nfree from tolls.  See 23 U.S.C. § 301 (“Except as provided in section 129 of this title with respect \nto certain toll bridges and toll tunnels, all highways constructed under the provisions of this title \nshall be free from tolls of all kinds.”).  However, it is manifestly incorrect that all roads built with \nfederal funds must be free from all tolls or that the exceptions to the general rule against tolls must \nbe narrowly construed.  Section 129 enumerates many circumstances in which tolling is permitted.  \nId. § 129.  And the VPPP provides that “[n]otwithstanding sections 129 and 301 . . . the Secretary \nshall allow the use of tolls on the Interstate System as part of any value pricing pilot program.”  \nVPPP, cl. 4.  Congress’ use of the word “notwithstanding” reflects its intent that, even in light of \nSection 301’s general ban on tolling federal-aid highways, tolls may be imposed pursuant to \napproved  congestion  pricing  programs.    As  the  Supreme  Court  has  noted,  the  word \n“notwithstanding” “shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.”  \nN.L.R.B. v. SW Gen., Inc., 580 U.S. 288, 302, (2017); see also Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Grp., 508 \nU.S. 10, 18 (1993) (“[A] clearer statement is difficult to imagine.”  (quotation omitted)).  “Such a \nclause confirms rather than constrains breadth.”  SW Gen., 580 U.S. at 302.   \nThe fact that the VPPP operates as a carve-out to the tolling ban does not mean that it \nshould be grudgingly applied or that the Secretary must  afford it only a narrow meaning.  \n68 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 69 of 109\nExceptions to a rule are entitled to no less dignity than the rule to which they are an exception.  As \nthe Supreme Court put it as recently as 2021:  \nExceptions and exemptions are no less part of Congress’s work than its rules and \nstandards—and all are worthy of a court’s respect.  That a law might temper its \npursuit of one goal by accommodating others can come as no surprise.  Often \nlegislation becomes possible only because of such compromises.  Often lawmakers \ntread in areas fraught with competing social demands where everyone agrees trade-\noffs are required.  Whatever the reason for a legislative compromise, we have no \nright to place our thumbs on one side of the scale or the other.  \nBP P.L.C. v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, 141 S. Ct. 1532, 1539 (2021); see also Food \nMktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. 427, 439 (2019) (recognizing that courts “have no \nlicense to give [statutory] exemption[s] anything but a fair reading”).  “[J]ust as we cannot properly \nexpand [an exemption] beyond what its terms permit, we cannot arbitrarily constrict it either by \nadding limitations found nowhere in its terms.”  Food Mktg. Inst., 588 U.S. at 439 (citation and \nemphases omitted).   \n“The long-standing history of the anti-tolling provision” cannot overcome Congress’ \nexpress amendment to the anti-tolling policy.  The Secretary’s apparent belief that he was required \nto narrowly construe the VPPP’s authorization for tolling programs thus was legally erroneous.   \n  After determining that he was required to give the exception for congestion pricing models \nonly a narrow construction, the Secretary then concluded that the scope of the Tolling Program \n“exceed[ed] the authority granted by Congress under the VPPP” because it used “cordon pricing” \n“in a situation where tolls are inescapable.”  Dkt. No. 87-5 at 3–4.  That conclusion also is legally \nerroneous.   \nStatutory interpretation properly proceeds “in accord with the ordinary public meaning of \nits terms at the time of its enactment.”  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020); see id. \n(“After all, only the words on the page constitute the law adopted by Congress and approved by \nthe President.”).

L. No. 102-240, § 1012(b).  In 1998, Congress changed \nthe name to “value pricing pilot programs.”  Pub. L. No. 105-178, § 1216(a)   Neither enactment \nincluded a statutory definition of the terms “congestion pricing pilot project” or “value pricing \npilot program.”  Nonetheless, contemporary understandings of congestion pricing indicate that \ncordon pricing falls within the class of project contemplated for tolling authorization at the time \nthe VPPP was enacted.   \nThe term “congestion pricing” derives from Professor Vickrey’s work dating back to the \n1950s.  SCAC ¶ 55.66  In 1959, he testified before the Congressional Joint Committee on \nWashington Metropolitan Problems that “[i]t is a specific feature of the pricing system suggested \nhere that it is to be applied to the street and highway system as a whole, and not merely to bits and \npieces of it.”  Id.  Professor Vickrey explicitly “contemplated that the control point [i.e., toll \nfacilities] should more or less completely block off the area into zones, so that it would not be \npossible to go from one zone to another without passing a checkpoint.”  Id.   \nOver the following years, Congress proceeded to source information and fund studies on \npotential congestion pricing projects which included cordon pricing initiatives.  Id. ¶¶ 82, 88, 92, \n94.  Such studies included the FHWA’s provision of funds to study Mayor Bloomberg’s proposed \ncordon pricing plan as well as a congestion pricing project in Fort Myers Beach that provided for \nonly two points of entry to the area and no toll-free route, a congestion pricing project in San \nFrancisco that included a quadrant where there would be no toll-free entry route, a congestion \npricing project in Los Angeles that included two cordon pricing areas in which every inbound route \n \n66 See William Vickrey, Statement to the Joint Committee on Washington, DC, Metropolitan \nProblems, 36 J.

Id. ¶ 74 (citing Congestion Pricing and Infrastructure Financing: \nHearing Before the Subcomm. on Water Res., Transp., and Infrastructure of the S. Comm. on Env’t \n& Pub. Works, 102nd Cong. 9 (1991)).  Following the hearing, numerous senators, including \nSenators Joe Lieberman and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, described those cordon pricing initiatives \nas “congestion pricing.”  Id.  The FHWA echoed this understanding.  In 1992, shortly after ISTEA \nwas enacted, a senator asked the FHWA how it was defining “congestion pricing projects” and \nreceived the response that the “potential scope of congestion pricing applications can vary widely, \nranging from pricing on a new or existing single road facility to more comprehensive area-wide \nroad pricing strategies.”  Id. ¶ 77 (emphasis added) (citing Dep’t of Transp. & Related Agencies \nAppropriations  for  Fiscal  Year  1993:  Hearings  Before  a  Subcomm.  of  the  S.  Comm.  on \nAppropriations, 102nd Cong. 352 (1992)). \nISTEA itself reflects Congress’ intent to support experimentation, giving the Secretary \nwide latitude to approve projects the Secretary viewed as achieving the program’s objectives.  Pub. \nL. No. 102-240, § 1012(b).  It states broad goals of “reduc[ing] energy consumption and air \npollution  while  promoting  economic  development  and  supporting  the  Nation’s  preeminent \nposition in international commerce” as well as improving “mobility for elderly persons, persons \nwith disabilities, and economically disadvantaged persons in urban and rural areas of the country,” \nincreasing “productivity growth,” and “reducing “traffic congestion.”  Id. § 2.  And President \nBush’s remarks at signing confirm that a “major element” of the law “was to provide State and \nlocal officials unprecedented flexibility” including “the discretion to use a major portion of their \nFederal surface transportation funds on the improvements that would best meet local needs, \n72 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 73 of 109\nwhether highway projects or public transit projects.”  Statement by President George Bush Upon \nSigning H.R. 2950, 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1865.  There is no reason to believe that Congress intended \nto create an artificial distinction between cordon pricing programs and other forms of congestion \npricing programs by requiring that projects provide a toll-free alternative.  To the extent the VPPP \nexpresses a concern with the tolling burden on low-income individuals, it resolves that concern by \nstating that pilot shall “shall include, if appropriate, an analysis of the potential effects of the pilot \nprogram on low-income drivers and may include mitigation measures to deal with any potential \nadverse financial effects on low-income drivers.”  VPPP cl. 7. \nDefendants are unable to overcome the myriad evidence demonstrating that the VPPP does \nnot distinguish between cordon pricing programs and other forms of congestion pricing.  They do \nnot point to a single historical source that supports their view. \n Defendants do not revive the argument that Secretary Duffy made in the February 19 \nLetter that “Congress in a separate statutory provision has authorized cordon pricing on the \nInterstate System.”  Dkt. No. 87-5 at 4 (citing 23 U.S.C. § 129(d)(4)(B), (6)(A)).  The Court deems \nthe argument to be abandoned.  See Jackson v. Fed. Exp., 766 F.3d 189, 198 (2d Cir. 2014) (“[A] \ncourt may, when appropriate, infer from a party’s partial opposition that relevant claims or \ndefenses that are not defended have been abandoned.”); accord Malik v. City of New York, 841 \nFed. App’x 281, 284 (2d Cir. 2021) (summary order).  There are good reasons for Defendants to \nhave  abandoned it.  Although the cited portion of the 2021 Infrastructure Jobs and Investment Act \nexpressly permits cordon pricing in addition to congestion pricing, the fact that a later Congress \ndecided to separately use the term “cordon pricing” cannot demonstrate that the earlier Congress \ndid not intend the phrase “congestion pricing” to include cordon pricing.  The argument in the \nFebruary 19 Letter suffers from a timing problem.  “[L]ater laws that do not seek to clarify an \n73 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 74 of 109\nearlier enacted general term and do not depend for their effectiveness upon clarification, or a \nchange in the meaning of an earlier statute, are beside the point in reading the first enactment.”  \nGutierrez v. Ada, 528 U.S. 250, 257–58 (2000) (quotation omitted).   \nDefendants also do not reassert the unsupported argument made in the February 19 Letter \nthat the fact no cordon pricing program has been approved before New York’s means that Congress \ndid not intend to authorize such a program.  It too is deemed abandoned.  See Jackson, 766 F.3d \nat 198.  In any event, such argument is meritless.  There is a first for every program.  There is no \nreason to assume that the first program of its kind must be unauthorized purely because it is the \nfirst.  This is particularly the case for a statute like the VPPP that was founded upon the theory that \nindividual states could “try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the \ncountry.”  Chan I, 2024 WL 5199945, at *24 (quotation omitted); see also infra § IV.A.2.e. \n(discussing the meaning of the term “pilot project”).  What is more telling is that there is no \nevidence that any administration has ever denied approval for a pilot project on the grounds that it \ndid not offer a toll-free alternative.   \nIndeed, the FHWA actually has authorized the imposition of tolls that do not provide for \nuntolled access.  Plaintiffs point out that the “FHWA has approved tolls on many routes that do \nnot provide for toll-free access, including several here in New York such as on the two I-278 \nbridges to Staten Island, as well as on two I-190 bridges to Grand Island, leaving no toll-free \nalternative routes to access either of those destinations.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 33.  Under Defendants’ \nargument, Staten Island and Grand Island are cordoned—even though there are means of access \nto both without paying a toll, those means do not include driving.  And, though it is technically \ntrue that—absent the Tolling Program—New Jersey commuters would be able to access the CBD \nwithout paying a toll, “the only such option would add approximately 300 miles to those drivers’ \n74 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 75 of 109\ncommutes, considering that the closest un-tolled Hudson River crossing is in Albany.”  Id.  The \nSecretary’s argument would have dramatic, and unprecedented, consequences. \nAn agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously when it takes actions that are not justified by \nits stated bases.  See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (“The reasoned \nexplanation requirement of administrative law, after all, is meant to ensure that agencies offer \ngenuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the \ninterested public.”).  Plaintiffs show a likelihood of success on the merits of their argument that \nthe Secretary’s decision to terminate the VPPP Agreement because the statute does not authorize \ncordon pricing programs was arbitrary and capricious. \nc.  Tolling Revenue \nOne other erroneous legal conclusion prompted the Secretary to determine that the VPPP \ndid not permit authorization of the Tolling Program: the Secretary’s conclusion that the VPPP does \nnot authorize tolls that are “calculated based on considerations separate from reducing congestion \nor advancing other road-related goals.”  Dkt. No. 87-5 at 4.68 \nThe VPPP does not contain any language excluding the consideration of other factors for \ndetermining tolling rates, and Defendants do not point to any source that supports the Secretary’s \ninterpretation.  Rather, the text of the VPPP undermines the Secretary’s legal conclusion.  The \nstatute provides that “[r]evenues generated by any pilot project . . . must be applied to projects \neligible under” under Title 23.  VPPP cl. 3.  It provides no restrictions on the use of program \nrevenues beyond that.  And transit capital projects are eligible for assistance under Title 31.  See \n \n68 Plaintiffs also take issue with Defendants’ characterization of the Tolling Program as being \n“driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit [sic] Authority as \nopposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 29 & n.19 (quoting 87-5 at 4).  Plaintiffs \nargue that the Tolling Program’s twin goals of reducing congestion and raising revenue are instead \n“complementary.”  Id. \n75 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 76 of 109\n23 U.S.C. § 142(a)(2).  Under the plain language of the VPPP, revenues can be used for purposes \nother than highway construction and thus projects can be designed to generate revenues for \npurposes other than highway construction, such as transit capital projects.  \nIndeed, the statutory text itself explicitly contemplates that the value pricing pilot programs \nthat are approved under the VPPP will include those that address congestion by, in part, improving \nalternatives to driving.  The statute  provides that the Secretary shall monitor and report the effects \nof value pricing pilot programs “are having on driver behavior, traffic volume, transit ridership, \nair quality, and availability of funds for transportation programs.”  VPPP cl. 2 (emphasis added).  \nIt is unmistakable that Congress intended to permit the Secretary to approve pilots that were \nintended to generate funds for transportation programs.  This Court has previously acknowledged \nthat “[b]ecause ISTEA provides for the use of excess tolling revenues, it is Congress’ unmistakably \nclear intent that a public authority be permitted to collect funds that exceed a toll road’s costs and \nspend those funds on non-toll road projects.”  Chan I, 2024 WL 5199945, at *17 (citing Owner \nOperator Indep. Drivers Ass’n, Inc. v. Penn. Tpk. Comm’n, 934 F.3d 283, 293 (3d Cir. 2019); Am. \nTrucking Assocs., Inc. v. N.Y. State Thruway Auth., 886 F.3d 238, 246 (2d Cir. 2018)).  Congress \nthus has affirmatively stated that the tolling revenues may be used for other purposes; it has not \nstated that the tolling rates must be calculated exclusively on the basis of congestion-related \nconsiderations.  Courts “do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text \nrequirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.”  Mendis v. Filip, 554 F.3d 335, 340 n.5 (2d Cir. \n2009) (Sotomayor, J.) (quoting Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335, 341 (2005)).  It \nwas thus arbitrary and capricious for Defendants to act on the basis of that legal conclusion. \nd.  Post Hoc Policy Rationales \nIn  their  memorandum  of  law  in  opposition  to  the  preliminary  injunction  motions, \nDefendants retreat from the contention in the February 19 Letter that Congress did not give the \n76 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 77 of 109\nFHWA the authority to sign the VPPP Agreement, Dkt No. 87-5 at 3, and instead attempt to \nrecharacterize the Secretary’s stated legal conclusions as merely communicating a shift in policy \npriorities.  Id.  They wholly abandon the argument that New York’s use of other considerations to \nset toll rates makes the Tolling Program ineligible under the VPPP.  Dkt. No. 118 at 45–46.  And \nthey argue that “even if Plaintiffs are right that FHWA had authority to enter into an Agreement \nauthorizing the kind of cordon pricing scheme operating under the [Tolling Program], that still \ndoes not detract from the valid policy concerns with the [Tolling Program]’s lack of toll-free \noptions for working class drivers . . . [which] are independently sufficient to justify FHWA’s \nactions thus far.”  Id. at 45. \nAt  the  outset,  Defendants’  policy  concerns  cannot  support  termination  because  the \nSecretary lacks the authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement on the basis of policy concerns.  \nSee supra, § IV.A.2.a.  However, even if the Secretary did possess such authority, Defendants’ \ninvocation of policy would still fail on the record before the Court.  \nDefendants cannot escape the Secretary’s flawed legal conclusions by, once those legal \nconclusions have been challenged, disavowing them and reframing the conclusions as mere \nexpressions of policy.  “It is a ‘foundational principle of administrative law’ that judicial review \nof agency action is limited to ‘the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.’”  \nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. at 20 (quoting Michigan v. E.P.A., 576 U.S. 743, 758 (2015)).  \n“When an agency’s initial explanation ‘indicate[s] the determinative reason for the final action \ntaken,’ the agency may elaborate later on that reason (or reasons) but may not provide new ones.”  \nId. at 21 (quoting Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam)); see id. (holding that \ncourts may not uphold agency action on the basis of “impermissible ‘post hoc rationalization’”  \n(quoting Volpe, 401 U.S. at 420)); Kakar v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., 29 F.4th 129, 133 \n77 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 78 of 109\n(2d Cir. 2022) (holding that the agency was “required to articulate a contemporaneous explanation \nfor its decision,” which could not be salvaged by an explanation the agency “formulated while \nlitigating this lawsuit” (quotation and alterations omitted)).   \nThe February 19 Letter mentioned the policy concerns only to explain why the Secretary \nconducted a review of “the tolling authority granted under VPPP to the [Tolling Program] for \ncompliance with Federal law.”  Dkt. No. 87-5 at 3.  In the February 19 Letter, the Secretary made \nclear that the purported termination of the VPPP Agreement was not based on those purported \nconcerns but on his “conclusion that FHWA lacked statutory authority to approve the cordon \npricing tolling under the [Tolling Program].”  Id. at 4.   \nThe bar against considering post hoc rationalizations is not “useless formality” but rather \n“serves  important  values  of  administrative  law”  by  promoting  agency  accountability  and \npermitting “orderly functioning of the process of review.”  Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. \nat 22–23 (quotations omitted).  When an agency points to policy concerns not actually examined \nor relied upon at the time of the action, it deprives the public and the court of the administrative \nrecord  necessary  to  determine  whether  such  action  was  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  23 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  And, of course, it \ndeprives the agency of the opportunity to actually consider whether the application of those policy \nconsiderations would in fact support the action.   \nThere are reasons to doubt that Defendants’ belatedly expressed policy concerns would \nsupport the termination decision even if they had served as the contemporaneous basis for \nDefendants’ decision.  The April 21 Letter expresses the concern that “[h]ighway users whose \ntaxes already paid for the Federal-aid highways in the cordon area are now being forced to pay \nagain while receiving no new highway benefits.”  Dkt. No. 87-10 at 2.  But it is the nature of any \n78 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 79 of 109\ntoll-based value pricing pilot program that it will impose costs on highway users whose taxes \nalready paid for the Federal-aid highways.  It is only because the highways received federal aid \nthat Federal approval would even be required.  Under Defendants’ logic, no federal-aid highway \nwould be tolled—a proposition that even the Secretary does not say he is adopting.  And, as to the \nnotion that the users will receive “no new highway benefits,” the April 21 Letter does not address \nthe demonstrated benefit received from measurably faster and more reliable travel speeds within \nthe CBD and connected river-crossings.  Dkt. No. 91 ¶ 25.  The Secretary’s February 19 Letter \nalso states that the Secretary “share[s] the President’s concerns about the impacts to working class \nAmericans who now have an additional financial burden to account for in their daily lives.”  Id. at \n3.    The  April 21  Letter  asserts  that  “New  York’s  cordon  pricing  program  imposes  a \ndisproportionate financial hardship on low and medium-income hardworking American drivers for \nthe benefit of high-income drivers.”  Dkt. No. 87-10 at 3.  The letters do not acknowledge the \ndiscount programs and tax credits available to ensure that low-income drivers can access the CBD \nwith reduced or no tolls.  Nor does the Secretary explain any basis for his assertion that the Tolling \nProgram disproportionally harms low and medium-income individuals.  As the Project Sponsors \nexplained to the FHWA, “[n]inety-eight percent of low-income workers with jobs in the Manhattan \nCBD do not commute by private vehicle” and are instead disproportionately reliant on the public \ntransit options that the Tolling Program seeks to improve.  Dkt. No. 91-2 at 9–10.  The letters also \ndo not acknowledge the prospect that the increased function, quality, and reach of New York’s \npublic transit offerings paid for by the tolls imposed on “high-income drivers” will benefit the \npresent class of low-income drivers.  Such benefits include both the demonstrated fact that the \nTolling Program has increased the speed and reliability of car commutes into the CBD and the \npossibility that low-income individuals who presently must drive will have better public transit \n79 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 80 of 109\noptions available to permit cheaper commutes by public transit.  The point is not that Defendants’ \npolicy rationales could never support a decision to oppose a cordon pricing program.  It is that the \nquestions they raise highlight the importance of, and the need for, judicial review based on the \ninformation actually considered and acted upon.  Though Defendants are free to construct their \nown policy priorities, the public is entitled to an orderly evaluation of actions purportedly taken \nbased on those policies. \nDefendants’  belated  attempts  to  reframe  the  motivating  considerations  as  policy \ndeterminations rather than conclusions of illegality are unavailing both as post hoc rationalizations \nand because termination is not available on the grounds of shifting agency priorities.  See supra, \n§ IV.A.2.a. \ne.  Plaintiffs’ Reliance Interests \nPlaintiffs further argue that Defendants’ purported termination was arbitrary and capricious \nbecause the Secretary “did not adequately consider the MTA and TBTA’s significant reliance \ninterests in the VPPP Agreement, FHWA’s 2019 statement that the VPPP is the ‘best fit’ for the \nProgram, or FHWA’s longstanding interpretation of the VPPP.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 38–42; Dkt. No. \n124 at 19–21.  Defendants respond that “the Secretary properly considered Plaintiffs’ reliance \ninterests when making his decision” in part because “an agency need not consider and weigh \n‘unreasonable’ reliance interests.”  Dkt. No. 118 at 46–47 (citing Libby Welding Co. v. United \nStates, 444 F. Supp. 987, 992 (D.D.C. 1977), aff’d, 595 F.2d 887 (D.C. Cir. 1979)). \n“When an agency changes course, . . . it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may \nhave engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”  Regents of the Univ. \nof Cal., 591 U.S. at 30 (quotation omitted).  “It would be arbitrary or capricious to ignore such \nmatters.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  The Supreme Court \nhas stated that the agency is “required to assess whether there were reliance interests, determine \n80 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 81 of 109\nwhether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy concerns.”  \nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. at 33.  Therefore, the agency must “provide a more detailed \njustification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate” in circumstances \nwhere “its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests.”  Fox Television, 556 U.S. at 15.  \nThe agency need not, however, “demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new \npolicy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible \nunder the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better.”  \nId. (emphases omitted).   \nPlaintiffs claim to have reasonably and significantly relied on “Defendants’ interpretation \nof the VPPP and on the VPPP Agreement in their financial planning to support and sustain the \nNew York metropolitan region’s public transit system.”  Dkt. No. 83 at 39.  In particular, they \npoint to the facts that the FHWA maintained a longstanding interpretation of the VPPP as covering \ncordon pricing, the FHWA’s statement in its letter of October 24, 2019 that the “VPPP appears to \nbe the best potential fit” for allowing tolls on existing infrastructure, and the statements in the \nVPPP Agreement authorizing tolling.  Id. at 40–41 (quoting Dkt. No. 91-3).  Based upon the \nFHWA’s communicated policy, the Project Sponsors developed and submitted the plan for the \nTolling Program and the TBTA expended over $500 million to establish the Tolling Program.  Dkt. \nNo. 85 ¶¶ 29–30.  It also took on the recurring expenditures related to operation and maintenance \nof the roadside tolling system, the operations of the back-office system and customer contact \ncenter, and consultant costs.  Id. ¶ 33.  The TBTA further acted in reliance by issuing $1.378 billion \nin short-term debt that is intended to be paid by the Tolling Program’s revenues and will be \nrefinanced with bonds secured by the Tolling Program’s  revenues.  Dkt. No. 84 ¶ 12; see also id \n81 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 82 of 109\n¶¶ 13–15 (detailing specific issuances and loans).  Those lenders, in turn, presumably relied upon \nthe FHWA’s longstanding interpretation when deciding to issue the loans. \nThese acts of reliance were well-known to Defendants.  The features of the Tolling \nProgram to which the Secretary now objects were also well known to his Department.  As early as \nApril 24, 2019, in their first discussions with FHWA, Plaintiffs informed Defendants that they \nwere planning to finance capital projects to improve New York City’s mass transit with bonds \nsecured by the toll revenue generated from congestion pricing.  Id. ¶ 5; see Dkt. No. 91-1 at 1 \n(minutes for the meeting noting the “statutory requirements to raise $15 Billion for bonding for \nthe MTA Capital”).  The FHWA specifically represented that the project was eligible for one of \nthe value pricing pilot slots allocated to New York.  See Dkt. No. 91-1 at 3; see also Dkt. No. 91-\n2 at 3 (“It is the State’s understanding that this congestion pricing program would be eligible under \na previously approved New York State VPPP slot”).   \nThe plan to use the revenues generated by the Tolling Program to finance the capital \nprojects that were intended to further reduce the number of vehicles entering the CBD and to be \ntolled was foundational to the entire congestion pricing project.  As Plaintiffs’ expression of \ninterest to FHWA in June 2019 explained: “By funding the modernization of the transit network, \nthe CBD tolling program would improve transit service and attract commuters back to the system, \nhelping to further ease demand on surface streets and thus reduce congestion in the CBD.”  Dkt. \nNo. 91-2 at 9; see also id. at 2 (“After considerable deliberation over the past decade regarding \nhow  to  mitigate  the  alarming  rate  of  growth  in  traffic  congestion,  including  two  recent \nGubernatorial Commission reports, New York State strongly believes that increased investment in \npublic  transportation  alternatives,  such  as  improving  the  existing  subway  and  bus  system, \nsupported through variable priced tolling provides the greatest return on investment for mitigating \n82 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 83 of 109\ntraffic congestion”), 6 (“Revenue raised by the program will provide sustained funding for public \ntransportation, which as it becomes more reliable, will contribution to congestion relief.”).     \nThe  MTA’s  chief  financial  officer  (“CFO”)  consulted  with  the  FHWA  during  the \npreparation of the June 2024 NEPA reevaluation and explained his “professional opinion that \nbased on current economic factors, such as interest rates, the adopted toll structure could generate \nsufficient funding through the issuance of long-term bonds to meet the TMA requirement.”  Dkt. \nNo. 84 ¶ 6.  The FHWA’s second reevaluation noted that “[t]he net revenue needed to fund \n$15 billion depends on a number of economic factors, including but not limited to interest rates \nand term.”  Reevaluation 2 at 8 n.2.  In recent court filings in New Jersey v. United States \nDepartment of Transportation et al., 23-cv-3885 (D.N.J.), the FHWA confirmed that the MTA’s \nCFO’s declaration explaining how the MTA and TBTA planned to issue long-term bonds to be \nrepaid by Program revenue “reflects FHWA’s contemporaneous understanding of the information \nconveyed by the Project Sponsors before FHWA’s issuance of Re-Evaluation #2.”  Id. ¶ 8.  The \nFHWA similarly confirmed that understanding in filings made to this Court in Chan et al. v. U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation et al., 23-cv-10365 (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 160 at 4.  And it could not \nhave been a surprise to the FHWA that the Tolling Program has been costly to establish and \nmaintain. \nThe FHWA was also well aware that the Tolling Program would not offer a toll-free option.  \nThe Project Sponsors highlighted and clearly discussed that feature of the program in their pre-\nauthorization conversations with the FHWA.  See Dkt No. 91 ¶¶ 2, 5–6, 10 Dkt. No. 91-1 at 6 \n(providing a map of the tolling zone that does not exempt any road into the CBD).

The February 19 Letter states that the Secretary “recognizes” that the “TBTA and \nNYSDOT have relied on the Agreement to begin collecting tolls under the program” but discounts \nthe significance of that reliance because many of the program-related costs “were incurred before \nFHWA signed the Agreement” and the FHWA approved only a “pilot project.”  Dkt. No. 87-5 at \n5.  In their opposition to the motions for a preliminary injunction, Defendants offer the following \nexplanations of why that consideration was sufficient to satisfy the APA: (1) Plaintiffs could not \nhave reasonably relied upon the FHWA’s and Secretary’s interpretation because the applicable \nregulation “expressly allows FHWA and the Secretary to terminate the agreement based solely on \nagency priorities”; (2) most of Plaintiffs’ expenditures predated the VPPP Agreement; (3) the \nTolling Program was approved as a “pilot project,” which could not have generated long-term \nreliance; and (4) Plaintiffs signed the VPPP Agreement after the 2025 election and in the months \nbefore President Trump’s administration took office.  Dkt. No. 118 at 47–48.  Defendants’ \narguments are unavailing. \nFirst, Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to their \nargument that 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 does not provides the FHWA with the unilateral ability to \nterminate the VPPP Agreement based on changed agency priorities in the absence of language in \nthe terms and conditions giving FHWA that ability.  The previously unexpressed and legally \nerroneous view that the FHWA could withdraw approval based solely on a change in priorities \ntherefore  could  not  have  disabused  Plaintiffs  of  their  reasonable  reliance  on  the  FHWA’s \nstatements that the project was eligible for a VPPP slot.  Furthermore, even where a prior policy \nis rescinded as unauthorized, the agency must consider “the options of retaining forbearance or \naccommodating particular reliance interests.”  Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. at 33. \n84 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 85 of 109\nSecond,  while  Defendants  are  correct  that  Plaintiffs’  expenditures  related  to  the \nestablishment of the Tolling Program predated the VPPP Agreement and thus could not have been \ntaken in reliance upon the VPPP Agreement per se, that response misunderstands Plaintiffs’ \nargument.  Plaintiffs claim that in addition to the VPPP Agreement itself, they relied upon other, \nearlier manifestations of the FHWA’s longstanding policy, including the FHWA’s statements to \nCongress, appropriation of funds to study cordon pricing initiatives, and communications between \nthe FHWA and Plaintiffs before the VPPP Agreement was signed in the years spent envisioning, \nplanning and then executing the congestion pricing project.  Dkt. No. 83 at 38–39, 42.  Over the \nyears since ISTEA was enacted, the federal government has never taken the view that it did not \nallow cordon pricing.  See Smiley v. Citibank (S. Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996) (holding \nthat agencies must “take account of legitimate reliance on prior interpretation”); Fox Television, \n556 U.S. at 515 (holding that the question is whether the “prior policy has engendered serious \nreliance interests”). \nThird, Defendants argue that the designation of the Tolling Program as a ‘“pilot project,’ \nby definition, implies a limited and experimental effort, not intended to generate long-term \nreliance.”  Dkt. No. 118 at 48; see Dkt. No. 87-5 at 5.  But although Defendants purport to derive \nthis argument from the definition of the term “pilot project,” they do not cite a single dictionary \nsupporting their contention that the term necessarily implies a project of short duration.  The \ndictionary definitions the Court has been able to source say nothing of the sort.  Black’s Law \nDictionary defines “pilot project” as “[a] small-scale advance study conducted to gauge the \nadvisability  of  conducting  a  full-scale  research  project  by  first  evaluating  its  design,  time \ncommitment, costs, and feasibility, plus the effects of potential adverse events.”  Black’s Law \nDictionary (12th ed. 2024).  The Random House Dictionary of the English Language defines “pilot \n85 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 86 of 109\nproject” as “an experimental or trial undertaking prior to full-scale operation or use.”  Random \nHouse Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1966).  These definitions indicate that a project \nis designated a pilot by virtue of its scope and not by its duration.  Many pilot projects are of long \nduration because that duration is necessary to determine whether the project can achieve its goal.   \nThe Tolling Program is just such a project.  It is a pilot in the sense that it is a “first of a \nkind” trial to determine whether the imposition of tolls and the use of that toll revenue to finance \ncapital projects to improve mass transit will divert enough travelers to the mass transit system to \nalleviate the critical problem of congestion in the country’s most important commercial sector.  \nBut it is necessarily of a lengthy duration because capital projects by their nature are long-term.   \nAs the MTA’s CFO explained, in order to generate the revenues necessary to fund the capital \nprojects to improve public transportation to and within the CBD, New York would need to issue \nbonds payable over a thirty-year time period.  Dkt. No. 84 ¶¶ 4–15.  Indeed, by its own terms, the \nVPPP Agreement requires the Secretary to monitor the effect of such programs for a period of at \nleast 10 years, indicating that the pilot programs could have at least that lifespan.  VPPP cl. 5.69  \nAnd as Plaintiffs point out, there would be few rational takers if the pilot projects authorized by \nthe VPPP required state and local governments to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on \nplanning, technology, and infrastructure with the understanding that the project was necessarily \nshort-term.  Merely labeling the project a “pilot” thus could not have put Plaintiffs on notice that \nexpiry was imminent or that it could be terminated solely because one Secretary of Transportation \nhas a different policy preference than an earlier Secretary.   \n \n69 Although the VPPP Agreement states that the TBTA and NYCDOT shall monitor and report \nupon project performance “for a period of at least ten years or to the end of the life of the Project, \nwhichever is sooner,” Dkt. No. 87-1 at 3, the potential that the Tolling Program might not last ten \nyears does not alone undermine Plaintiffs’ reasonable reliance when the termination agreement \nprovided for early termination by the Project Sponsors but not by Defendants. \n86 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 87 of 109\nFourth, Defendants argue that the fact that Plaintiffs “rushed to finalize an agreement in \nNovember knowing that the incoming President was opposed to the [Tolling Program]” makes \ntheir reliance unreasonable.  Dkt. No. 118 at 48.  They argue that as a matter of “common sense,” \nPlaintiffs could not have actually relied on the belief that the FHWA’s prior policy would remain \nunchanged.  Id.  However, the country has only one President at a time.  And it is fair to presume \nthat that President will follow the law, including the APA.   \nPlaintiffs’ expenditures to design and implement the Tolling Program began well before \nthe election cycle had even begun.  At that point, Plaintiffs were under no obligation to tailor their \nfuture planning to the possibility that a candidate opposed to the Tolling Program would become \npresident, much less to predicate their planning on what he or his cabinet appointee would do once \nhe was the president.  The statements that a candidate makes on the stump do not necessarily define \nthe actions their administration will take when in power, especially once the agency undertakes \nthe consideration of the evidence that the APA requires.  See Hawaii v. Trump, 585 U.S. 667, 699–\n700 (2018) (disregarding statements made by then-candidate Trump when reviewing the basis for \nacts taken by the Trump Administration after he assumed office).  And the Project Sponsors were \nnot required to believe that the statements candidate Trump made while campaigning and before \nhe was elected and took office would necessarily become policy once he was elected and became \ncharged with representing the entirety of the United States.  Plaintiffs also had no obligation to act \nin accordance with what the incoming Secretary believed the law to be.  When the Supreme Court \nheld in Loper Bright that interpretation of the law lies in the courts’ domain rather than agencies’, \nit noted that that arrangement safeguards reliance interests.  See Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 392 \n(stating that deference to shifting agency interpretations “fosters unwarranted instability in the law, \nleaving those attempting to plan around agency action in an eternal fog of uncertainty”).  Plaintiffs \n87 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 88 of 109\nwere entitled to rely on an agreement signed by the then-and-still Executive Director of the FHWA \nas well as the federal government’s statements and actions taken over the course of several \nadministrations, including the first Trump Administration. \nUltimately, none of Defendants’ arguments show that Plaintiffs’ reliance was unreasonable \nsuch that the Secretary was relieved of the requirement to assess the reliance interests, determine \nwhether they were significant, and weigh them against competing policy concerns.  See Regents \nof the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. at 33.  Defendants now argue that the Secretary did weigh Plaintiffs’ \nreliance interests “against the broader harms—to working-class commuters, to New Jersey, and to \nfederal taxpayers.”  Dkt. No. 118 at 48–49.  However, Defendants’ failure to acknowledge the \nreasonableness of Plaintiffs’ reliance in either the February 19 Letter or the instant briefing \ncontradicts that claim.  Furthermore, the February 19 Letter does not state that the Secretary \nweighed Plaintiffs’ reliance against those “broader harms” but rather that “any reliance interests \ncannot overcome the conclusion that FHWA’s approval was not authorized by law.”  Dkt. No. 87-\n5 at 5.  As previously stated, the conclusion that the FHWA’s prior approval of the Tolling Program \nwas not authorized by law is based on an incorrect interpretation of the VPPP.  It therefore cannot \nsuffice to override the FHWA’s required weighing analysis. \nPlaintiffs show a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to their argument that the \nSecretary and the FHWA acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to adequately consider \nPlaintiffs’ reliance interests. \nf.  NEPA Review \nNEPA imposes “procedural requirements on federal agencies with a particular focus on \nrequiring agencies to undertake analyses of the environmental impact of their proposals and \nactions.”  Dep’t of Transp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756–57 (2004).  It requires that for “major \nFederal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,” the agency must \n88 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 89 of 109\nprepare a detailed statement setting forth the “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  To determine whether a major federal action will significantly affect the \nenvironment, the agency may prepare an environmental assessment, just as the FHWA did prior \nto authorizing the Tolling Program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(2) (“An agency shall prepare an \nenvironmental assessment with respect to a proposed agency action that does not have a reasonably \nforeseeable significant effect on the quality of the human environment, or if the significance of \nsuch effect is unknown.”).  NEPA states that the environmental assessment shall “set forth the \nbasis of such agency’s finding of no significant impact or determination that an environmental \nimpact statement is necessary.”  Id.  “Because NEPA does not independently provide for judicial \nreview, NEPA is enforced through lawsuits filed under the APA.”  Chan II, 2025 WL 1144703, at \n*9. \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants’ decision to terminate the VPPP Agreement is a major \nfederal action that threatens sufficiently significant environmental effects, such that the FHWA \nwas required to undertake an environmental review.  Dkt. No. 83 at 37–38; Dkt. No. 124 at 21–\n23; see Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 363 n.21 (1979) (“Major Federal actions include the \nexpansion or revision of ongoing programs.” (quotation and alterations omitted)); Upper Snake \nRiver Chapter of Trout Unlimited v. Hodel, 921 F.2d 232, 234 (9th Cir. 1990) (“[I]f an ongoing \nproject undergoes changes which themselves amount to ‘major Federal actions,’ the operating \nagency must prepare an [environmental impact statement].”).   \nDefendants argue that the FHWA was not required to perform any new environmental \nreview because the EA and reevaluations prepared in advance of the VPPP Agreement adequately \nassessed the impact of termination.  Dkt. No. 118 at 50–51.  They point out that the EA included \nthe no action alternative, “which assessed the environmental impact if the VPPP Agreement was \n89 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 90 of 109\nnot signed and implemented, and then compared that with the environmental impact if the VPPP \nAgreement was signed and implemented.”  Id. at 50. \n“NEPA does not prevent an agency from satisfying future NEPA obligations by performing \na NEPA analysis at the outset of a long-term project.”  Mayo v. Reynolds, 875 F.3d 11, 22 (D.C. \nCir. 2017).  However, a single NEPA analysis will not suffice if the environmental analysis occurs \ntoo early in the planning process to provide ‘“meaningful information’ necessary for informed \nconsideration.”  Id.  Therefore, where a project involves separate subprojects or changes yet to be \nfinalized, the agency may be required to undertake a separate or supplemental NEPA review.  See \nMarsh v. Oregon Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 373 (1989) (“If there remains major Federal \naction to occur, and if the new information is sufficient to show that the remaining action will \naffect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not \nalready considered, a supplemental EIS must be prepared.” (quotation omitted)).   \nAlthough Plaintiffs point out that the EA and FONSI issued in anticipation of the VPPP \nAgreement  “identified numerous environmental  benefits of the  [Tolling Program] including \nsignificant reductions in traffic congestion and air pollution regionwide,” and therefore posit that \nhalting the Tolling Program “would inevitably increase congestion and air pollution, among \npotentially other adverse environmental consequences,” in their preliminary injunction briefing, \nthey do not identify any potential environmental consequences outside of those already predicted \nfor the no action alternative in the FHWA’s earlier NEPA review.  Dkt. No. 83 at 37–38.  They do \nnot, for example, claim that there would be unique environmental consequences incurred because \nthe Tolling Program was implemented for a few months prior to the potential return to the no \naction alternative.  On the present record, Plaintiffs therefore have not established that the FHWA \n90 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 91 of 109\ncould not rely upon the already assembled comparative information to determine that ending the \nTolling Program would not have significant environmental effects.   \nUltimately, because NEPA is an “action-forcing” statute meant to ensure that agencies \nconsider project effects, Chan II, 2025 WL 1144703, at *24, courts will not demand that agencies \nthat have already considered the environmental consequences engage in the performative gesture \nof complying with NEPA’s procedural requirements, see Nevada v. Dep’t of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, \n90 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing Ill. Com. Comm’n v. I.C.C., 848 F.2d 1246, 1257 (D.C. Cir. 1988)); \nIdaho  Sporting  Cong.  Inc.  v.  Alexander,  222  F.3d  562,  567  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (noting  that \n“[c]ompliance with NEPA’s procedures is not an end unto itself” and courts look to whether the \nagency’s environmental assessment “can serve practically as an important contribution to the \ndecisionmaking process and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made” \n(quotation omitted)).  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the FHWA’s earlier NEPA review \nfailed to take into  account information necessary to evaluate the environmental impacts of \nterminating the VPPP Agreement and that would have required a separate or supplemental \nenvironmental assessment. \nPlaintiffs  do not show a likelihood of success on the merits of their argument that \nDefendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to conduct a new NEPA analysis before \ndeciding to terminate the VPPP Agreement. \n3.  Compliance Measures \nPlaintiffs argue that even if the Secretary had validly terminated the VPPP Agreement, \nDefendants could not impose the “compliance measures” threatened in the April 21 Letter.  Dkt. \nNo. 83 at 42–51; Dkt. No. 89 at 10–15.  Dkt. No. 124 at 23–25; Dkt. No. 126 at 7–10.  They argue \nthat  (1) Defendants  lack  authority  to  impose  the  threatened  sanctions;  (2) enforcing  the \nFebruary 19  Letter  would  violate  the  Pennhurst  clear  statement  rule;  and  (3) Defendants’ \n91 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 92 of 109\nwithholding of federal funding is unconstitutionally coercive.70  Defendants focus only on the first \nargument, responding that “the Secretary’s proposed compliance actions fall with his regulatory \nauthority” pursuant to 23 C.F.R. § 1.36.  Dkt. No. 118 at 51–56.   \nPlaintiffs’ arguments would have the Court issue an advisory opinion.  They would have \nthe Court indicate whether, if the Secretary had authority to terminate the VPPP Agreement and if \nhis decision to terminate the VPPP Agreement was lawful and not arbitrary and capricious, he \ncould exercise the compliance measures he has stated that he intends to take.  However, the federal \ncourts do not sit to render advisory opinions.  See Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911).  \nBecause Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success with respect to the predicate for any \ncompliance measures is unlawful—the Secretary did not have the power to abrogate the VPPP \nAgreement and his decision to do so was arbitrary and capricious—the Court has no occasion to \nentertain the purely hypothetical question whether the Secretary could engage in his planned \ncompliance measures  were the situation otherwise. \nThe April 21 Letter—like Defendants’ opposition—cites a single source of purported \nauthority to impose the threatened sanctions.  It is a regulation promulgated by the FHWA which \nstates: \nIf the Administrator determines that a State has violated or failed to comply with \nthe Federal laws or the regulations in this part with respect to a project, he may \nwithhold payment to the State of Federal funds on account of such project, withhold \napproval of further projects in the State, and take such other action that he deems \nappropriate under the circumstances, until compliance or remedial action has been \naccomplished by the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator. \n23 C.F.R. § 1.36; see Dkt. No. 87-10 at 1; Dkt. No. 118 at 51–56.   \n \n70 For the purposes of this Opinion and Order, the Court need not address Defendants’ purported \nviolation of the Tenth Amendment. \n92 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 93 of 109\nThe power of the administrator of FHWA, and therefore that of the Secretary, thus turns \non whether the States “has violated or failed to comply with the Federal laws or the regulations in \nthis part with respect to a project.”  23 C.F.R. § 1.36.  “When Congress passes an Act empowering \nadministrative agencies to carry on governmental activities, the power of those agencies is \ncircumscribed by the authority granted.”  Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 309 (1944); see Open \nSoc’y Just. Initiative v. Trump, 510 F. Supp. 3d 198, 214 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (“The acts of all \nexecutive branch officers must be justified by some law.”).  However, Plaintiffs have shown a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their argument that Defendants did not properly determine \nthat New York has violated any law or regulation including 23 U.S.C. § 301, by collecting tolls as \npart of the Tolling Program.  It follows that Plaintiffs show a likelihood of success on the merits \nof the argument that, by its own terms, 23 C.F.R. § 1.36 provides Defendants no authority to pursue \nNew York’s compliance.  New York is not required to comply with the Secretary’s dictates unless \nthose dictates are founded in law.  In the absence of a violation of law, there is no authority in the \nSecretary to take the threatened compliance measures.  See State of Tenn. ex rel. Leech v. Dole, \n567 F. Supp. 704, 718 (M.D. Tenn. 1983) (“True [though] it is that 23 C.F.R. § 1.36 provides \nauthority to the FHWA Administrator to withhold payments and to take other appropriate action, \nthis regulation applies only if a State fails to comply with or violates federal law or regulations.”), \nrev’d on other grounds, 749 F.2d 331 (6th Cir. 1984). \nV.  Irreparable Harm \n“[T]he single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction” is \nwhether the litigant seeking the injunction “would be irreparably injured in the absence of \npreliminary injunctive relief.”  Yang v. Kosinski, 960 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir. 2020).  “Irreparable \nharm is injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent and that cannot be \nremedied by an award of monetary damages.”  New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, \n93 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 94 of 109\n787 F.3d 638, 660 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an \ninjunction only if they can demonstrate that, in the interval between this date and the date in the \nnear future upon which the Court is expected to render a final decision, they will suffer an injury \nthat cannot be repaired.  The key word is “irreparable” and “[t]he possibility that adequate \ncompensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of \nlitigation, weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.”  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, \n90 (1974); accord Jayaraj v. Scappini, 66 F.3d 36, 39 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[W]here monetary damages \nmay provide adequate compensation, a preliminary injunction should not issue.”).  Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated several forms of irreparable harm, each one of which would be sufficient to establish \ntheir claim for preliminary injunctive relief. \nA prohibition on a state from “effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people” \nitself inflicts “a form of irreparable injury.”  New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., \n434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers); accord Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, \n1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (same); see also Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 602 & \nn.17 (2018) (“The inability to enforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on \nthe State.”); State of Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., 104 F.4th 577, 613 (6th Cir. 2024) (finding \nirreparable harm where “[a]bsent an injunction, the States will be forced to comply with the \nDepartment’s new regulations, contrary to their own policies”); see also Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. \n131, 135 (1986) (“Federal nullification of a state statute is a grave matter.”).  The TMA was \nadopted by duly elected representatives of the people of the State of New York and signed by the \nduly elected Governor of New York.  It followed years of study and was based on the conclusion \nthat its adoption would serve the interests of those who live and work in New York, including their \neconomic interests.  See N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 1701.  The Tolling Program implements that \n94 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 95 of 109\nlegislation.  The Secretary’s actions to purportedly revoke the VPPP Agreement and to impose \nsanctions to force New York to abandon that duly adopted plan itself inflicts harm on the State, its \nresidents, and those who use its roadways and facilities that cannot be repaired with an award of \nmoney damages. \nPlaintiffs would suffer other forms of irreparable harm if the Secretary were to take the \ncompliance measures he has stated he can implement if the Tolling Program does not cease.  \nPlaintiffs have outlined a great many projects that rely upon the imperiled funds and approvals: \n•  The NYCDOT is planning to rebuild the ramp connecting the Harlem River Drive \nto the Trans-Manhattan Expressway in Upper Manhattan.  Dkt. No. 86 ¶ 13.  The \nramp has been in operation for 80 years and is nearing the end of its intended service \nlife.  Id.  The project to rebuild the ramp requires NEPA approval and cannot \nproceed if the FHWA withholds that approval.  Id. \n•  The NYCDOT is seeking to reconstruct Delancey Street in the Lower East Side to \nreduce collisions, improve pedestrian safety, and prevent street failure events such \nas sinkholes.  Id. ¶ 14.  The project is depended upon federal funding and approvals.  \nId. \n•  The NYSDOT is relying primarily (80%) on FAHA formula funds to reconfigure \nI-81 in the Syracuse area by replacing an aging viaduct that carries a heavily used \nportion of the highway with a street-level highway and making improvements to \nother nearby highways.  Dkt. No. 90 ¶ 37.  The I-81 corridor is heavily used for \ntrucking and is a vital aspect of the United States’ manufacturing and shipping.  Id. \n¶ 36.  Approximately 600 construction personnel are working directly on the \nproject.  Id. ¶ 38.  A freeze on either funding or approvals could leave the project \n95 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 96 of 109\nin limbo with only some of the replacement infrastructure in place.  Id. ¶¶ 39–40, \n42.   \n•  The NYSDOT is pursuing a project to replace and rehabilitate five bridges on the \nCross Bronx Expressway.  Id. ¶ 45.  The project is currently going through NEPA \nevaluation and is programmed to receive approximately $330 million of federal \nformula funds and discretionary funds.  Id. \n•  Hundreds of other NYSDOT projects intended to address safety and congestion \nconcerns in Hamilton County, the Adirondacks, Jefferson County, Washington \nCounty, Long Island, the Hudson Valley, and other parts of New York are waiting \nfor federal approval or officially obligated funds.  Dkt. No. 90 ¶¶ 46–53.  \nOf course, it is possible that approvals might later be granted if the Court ultimately \ndetermines that the Secretary’s revocation of the VPPP Agreement was unlawful and he did not \nhave the authority to implement the “compliance measures.”  But Plaintiffs and those on whose \nbehalf they act will have suffered irreparable harm in the interim.  While the funds and approvals \nare withheld, roads will not be repaired, jobs will be lost, projects will become vastly more \nexpensive due to inflation, and the infrastructure will become increasingly degraded.  Id. ¶¶ 43, \n55.  As unrepaired transportation infrastructure continues to age and degrade, the state fisc will \nsuffer and taxpayers will be forced to fund increased maintenance costs.  Id. ¶¶ 59, 61; Dkt. No. 84 \n¶ 31.  Deteriorating road conditions are also likely to damage vehicles, including the MTA’s buses.  \nDkt. No. 84 ¶ 30.  Withholding funds and approvals would also create an administrative backlog \nthat would significantly burden the NYSDOT’s ability to orderly pursue other approvals and \nauthorizations and to oversee other projects.  Dkt. No. 90 ¶¶ 63–64.  Ultimately, “[i]t is so obvious \nthat it almost need not be stated that when money is obligated . . . and is not paid as promised, \n96 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 97 of 109\nharm follows—debt is incurred, debt is unpaid, . . . and budgets are upended.”  New York v. Trump, \n2025 WL 715621, at *13 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025). \n  By the same token, if the Plaintiffs were to accede to Defendants’ threat and halt the \nTolling Program, even in the face of a court finding that such threat is likely unlawful, they would \nalso suffer irreparable harm.  Plaintiffs have invested significant taxpayer dollars in enacting and \nadministering the Tolling Program.  Dkt. No. 84 ¶¶ 12–15; Dkt. No. 85 ¶¶ 29–30, 33.  Termination \nwould cause the TBTA to incur approximately $12 million in additional expenditures each month \nuntil the Court could issue a final determination.  Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 33.  Perhaps more devastating, if \nthe Plaintiffs were to cease operating the Tolling Program, they would be deprived of the tolling \nrevenues intended to fund transit capital projects and necessary to refinance the TBTA’s short-\nterm debt obligations.  Dkt. No. 84 ¶¶ 12–15; Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 34.  Those funds are earmarked for \nprojects  to  make  numerous  subway  stations  more  accessible  to  riders  with  disabilities  by \npermitting them to access public transportation without having to climb or descend steep stairways; \nto improve the MTA’s outdated signaling system to reduce train delays and ensure that riders get \nto work, school, or home on time; to provide better customer service though technology; and to \nextend public transit to under-served areas ensuring that all those who live in, work in, and travel \nto New York can get where they want to go.  Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 35.71  Absent an injunction, those \nprojects would be imperiled or at least delayed.  Irreparable harm exists where, in reliance on the \nfederal government’s approval of a program, a state makes “substantial resource investments in \nplanning for the implementation of that program,” only to have that approval rescinded and the \nexpectation interest that the state would be able to capitalize on those investments stymied.  Texas \n \n71  See  MTA,  2020–2024  Capital  Program:  Exec.  Summary  (Oct.  1,  2019), \nhttps://files.mta.info/s3fs-public/2019-09/MTA%202020-2024%20Capital%20Program%20-\n%20Executive%20Summary.pdf. \n97 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 98 of 109\nv. Brooks-LaSure, 2021 WL 5154219, at *12 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 20, 2021).  If Plaintiffs halt the \nTolling Program, then even if the Court’s ultimate merits determination were to permit the Tolling \nProgram to resume without the specter of withheld federal funds and approvals, Plaintiffs would \nnot be made whole as they (and those they serve) cannot be adequately compensated for the delays \nin implementing those capital improvements. \nIn effect, Defendants have challenged Plaintiffs to a game of chicken.  Plaintiffs can cease \noperation of the Tolling Program or else may brace for impact and prepare to suffer the effects of \nDefendants’ threatened compliance measures.  Either option would irreparably harm Plaintiffs.  \nSee City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 579, 655–57 (E.D. Pa. 2017) (enjoining \nAttorney  General  from  imposing  conditions  on  grants  to  state  and  local  law  enforcement \nconcerning immigration enforcement because the city was presented with only the irreparably \ninjurious options of accepting the grant and changing its policies, accepting the grant without \nchanging its policies at risk of sanctions, or foregoing the funds).  This is the “prototypical” \nhardship.  U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 414 F. Supp. 3d at 565. \nDefendants  fail  to  offer  any  persuasive  response.    They  argue  that  the  harms  of \nnoncompliance are merely speculative because the FHWA has not yet imposed any compliance \nmeasures.  Dkt. No. 118 at 30.  However, “[a]s a preliminary injunction requires only a likelihood \nof irreparable injury, Damocles’s sword does not have to actually fall . . . before the court will \nissue an injunction.”  League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8–9 (D.C. \nCir. 2016) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  A preliminary \ninjunction is intended to prohibit a defendant from undertaking actions the Court has determined \nis likely unlawful before those actions are taken.   \n98 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 99 of 109\nThe threat of illegal action is hardly speculative. The April 21 Letter states in no uncertain \nterms that if the FHWA determines that New York has not complied with 23 U.S.C. § 301, \n“FHWA will implement appropriate initial compliance measures beginning on or after May 28, \n2025, until compliance is achieved, to include” withholding AC authorizations in Manhattan, \nNEPA approvals in Manhattan, and approval of STIP amendments concerning NYMTC TIP \nmodifications.  Dkt. No. 87-10 at 2 (emphasis added).  The text of the letter makes clear that the \nFHWA will implement all three “compliance measures” in addition to potential other measures on \nor after May 28, 2028.  Id.  Withholding STIP approvals amounts to withholding federal funding \nbecause only projects in a STIP that have been approved by the FHWA or FTA are eligible for \nfunds administered by the FHWA or FTA.  23 C.F.R. § 450.222(a); Dkt. No. 90 ¶¶ 30–32.  \nWithholding AC authorizations and NEPA approvals stalls infrastructure projects and causes many \nof the delay-related harms outlined above.  Plaintiffs are not required to wait to seek preliminary \ninjunctive relief until Defendants take the actions they have promised to take imminently. \nCourts have repeatedly recognized the irreparable harm inherent to a situation such as the \none in which Defendants have presently placed Plaintiffs, in which a plaintiff can either accede to \nthe government’s presumptively unlawful threat or else disobey the government’s directive and \nexpose itself to potentially devastating injury throughout the pendency of the proceedings.  For \nexample, when the Attorney General sought to impose new conditions on an annual federal grant \nrelied on by the City of Chicago for law enforcement initiatives, the Northern District of Illinois \nheld that “forcing the City either to decline the grant funds based on what it believes to be \nunconstitutional conditions or accept them and face an irreparable harm, is the type of ‘Hobson’s \nchoice’ that supports irreparable harm.”  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 950 \n(N.D. Ill. 2017), aff’d, 888 F.3d 272 (7th Cir. 2018) (subsequent history omitted).  And when cities \n99 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 100 of 109\nin California were targeted by the President’s executive order purporting to prevent so-called \nsanctuary jurisdictions from receiving federal grants, the Ninth Circuit found irreparable harm in \nthe fact that “[a] total loss of federal funding would be catastrophic, and the Counties’ (and their \nresidents’) need for certainty renders damages inadequate.”  City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. \nTrump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1244 (9th Cir. 2018); see also City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, 2018 WL \n6071072, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2018) (“While Los Angeles makes many arguments as to how \nit will suffer irreparable injury absent an injunction, this Court finds most persuasive its argument \nthat it is faced with an impossible choice: either it must certify compliance with unconstitutional \nand unlawful directives that impinge on the City’s sovereignty, damage community trust, and harm \npublic safety, or it will lose congressionally authorized . . . funding.”), aff’d sub nom. City of Los \nAngeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931 (9th Cir. 2019); City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 2025 WL \n1186310, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2025) (“The threat to withhold funding causes [plaintiffs] \nirreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty.”).   \nDefendants argue that those cases are distinguishable because they concern situations in \nwhich the government actually identified which funds would be withheld or which approvals \nwould be revoked.  Dkt. No. 118 at 30–31.  Here the April 21 Letter “identifies a list of broad \ncategories of compliance measures FHWA may take, without determining whether it would \nimpose any such measures at all, let alone actually identifying what specific measure(s) the agency \nwould take within those categories.”  Dkt. No. 118 at 30–31.  But that after-the-fact legal argument \nmisstates both the position the FHWA has taken and the law.  The April 21 Letter leaves no \nuncertainty as to what the FHWA will do if it finds that New York has failed to cease tolling \nfederal-aid highways in connection with the Tolling Program: with exceptions for projects deemed \nby the FHWA to be essential for safety, the FHWA will withhold AC authorizations in Manhattan, \n100 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 101 of 109\nNEPA approvals in Manhattan, and approval of STIP amendments concerning NYMTC TIP \nmodifications.  Dkt. No. 87–10 at 2.  There is nothing equivocal about the statement.  The only \nthing it leaves uncertain is whether the “compliance measures” will be taken on May 28, 2025, or \nat some undefined time thereafter.  And the fact that the Secretary has threatened a panoply of \ninjurious compliance measures—some of which the FHWA has stated it “will” take and some of \nwhich it may ultimately choose not to pursue—rather than targeting a more limited expenditure of \nfunds, in no way mitigates the irreparable harm Plaintiffs will suffer if, as appears likely, it turns \nout that the revocation of the VPPP Agreement was unlawful.  The federal government may not \nforce states to comply with its dictates by threatening destructive retribution, only to turn around \nonce compliance is secured and claim that it was merely bluffing.  See MedImmune, Inc. v. \nGenentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 129 (2007) (holding that where a plaintiff eliminates “the imminent \nthreat of harm by simply not doing what he claimed the right to do,” that will not preclude subject-\nmatter  jurisdiction  for  declaratory  relief  if  “the  threat-eliminating  behavior  was  effectively \ncoerced”).  For this same reason, the fact that the FHWA may deem certain projects to be “essential \nfor safety” and thus not subject to withheld federal funding or approval is cold comfort.  Dkt. \nNo. 87-10 at 2.  The FHWA offers no insight into how it will determine which projects, if any, are \nsafety projects.  Id.  Waiting to see what the FHWA will decide with respect to each project will \nhave a destructive impact on Plaintiffs’ ability to plan, budget for, and timely pursue infrastructure \nprojects.  Dkt. No. 86 ¶¶ 13–14, 17.  Injunctive relief may be awarded “[w]hen enforcement actions \nare imminent,” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 381 (1992), even if the precise \nnature of the enforcement remains to be known, see, e.g., United States v. North Carolina, 192 F. \nSupp. 3d 620, 623 n.2 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (enjoining threatened withholding of federal funds \nbecause although it was not clear how much funding plaintiffs would lose during the pendency of \n101 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 102 of 109\nthis case, “in light of the magnitude of the funds at issue and the nature of the services provided, \nthe court is satisfied that the loss of funding during the pendency of this case will likely be severe \nenough to constitute irreparable harm”).   \nDefendants  next  argue  that  Plaintiffs’  “delay”  in  filing  for  a  preliminary  injunction \nundermines their claims of irreparable harm.  Dkt. No. 118 at 29.   Defendants argue that because \nthe Secretary announced the purported termination of the VPPP Agreement on February 19, 2025, \nPlaintiffs’ failure to move for injunctive relief until May 5, 2025 is incompatible with their claims \nof irreparable harm.  This argument does not stand up to even cursory review; the timeline reveals \nthat it is Defendants, not Plaintiffs, that have stalled for time.   \nPlaintiffs have been both prompt and assiduous in pursuing their claims.  They filed a 51-\npage complaint on February 19, 2025, the very day the Secretary announced the purported \ntermination.  Dkt. No. 1.  As early as April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs alerted the Court to the potential \nneed to seek preliminary injunctive relief, noting their view that the case would be “best resolved \nthrough orderly summary judgment and without the exigency that accompanies motions under \nRule 65,” but also noting that if Defendants acted to withhold funds, Plaintiffs would “act swiftly \nto assert their rights.”  Dkt. No. 49 at 4.  Plaintiffs noted that the “Federal Defendants ha[d] \nunilaterally announced shifting deadlines by which, they claim[ed], tolling ‘must cease,’” first \nsetting a deadline of March 20, 2025, then setting a deadline of April 20, 2025.  Id.  Plaintiffs \nstated that they had pressed Defendants as to whether Defendants intended to take “unilateral \naction on or after April 20 that might require Plaintiffs to seek expedited injunctive relief.”  Id.  \nDefendants were unable to answer.  Id.  And, had Defendants not issued the April 21 Letter, the \nparties and the Court were on track to have this case resolved in an orderly manner through \nsummary judgment within months without forcing the Court to express a preliminary view.   \n102 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 103 of 109\nAs it turns out, within weeks of the April 4 Letter, and Defendants’ supposed inability to \nlet Plaintiffs know if enforcement measures were imminent, the Secretary issued the April 21 \nLetter threatening to take action as early as May 28, 2025.  Plaintiffs did not wait after receiving \nthat letter to seek the Court’s assistance.  Plaintiffs responded to the April 21 Letter with alacrity.  \nThey informed the Court of the letter on April 23, 2025, noting that the May 28 date was one day \nafter the Defendants were to file their answers and the administrative record in this case and that \nthey would meet and confer with Defendants “on an appropriate schedule to brief a motion for a \npreliminary injunction preventing the threatened enforcement actions.”  Dkt. No. 64 at 1–2.  \nPlaintiffs immediately followed up on their commitments.  They contacted Defendants on April \n24, 2025 and then again on April 29 to arrange a meet-and-confer, but to no avail. Dkt. Nos. 71,70-\n1.   After Defendants ultimately responded on April 30 that they did not see a reason for Plaintiffs \nto file a preliminary injunction motion, Plaintiffs offered to postpone seeking a briefing schedule \nfor preliminary injunctive relief if the Defendants would agree not to take enforcement action, \neven temporarily.  Id. at 2.  Defendants declined.  It was at that point, on May 2, 2025, that Plaintiffs \nproposed to the Court a briefing schedule that would require motions for a preliminary injunction \nto be filed just three days later by May 5, 2025, with a condensed briefing schedule to follow.  Dkt. \nNo. 71-1.  This speedy course of action is consistent with Plaintiffs’ claims of irreparable harm \nresulting from Defendants’ threatened enforcement. \n It is true that a delay in bringing suit or moving for injunctive relief may “undercut[] the \nsense of urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary relief and suggest[] that \nthere is, in fact, no irreparable injury.”  Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Prods., 60 F.3d 964, 968 \n(2d Cir. 1995) (quoting Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 277 (2d Cir. 1985)).  But there \nis no evidence of delay.     \n103 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 104 of 109\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that they would be irreparably harmed absent a preliminary \ninjunction. \nVI.  Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest   \nUnder the last injunction factor, courts must “balance the competing claims of injury and \nmust consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief,’ as \nwell as ‘the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.’”  Yang, \n960 F.3d at 135–36; see also We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, 17 F.4th 266, 295 (2d Cir. \n2021) (“When the government is a party to the suit, [the] inquiries into the public interest and the \nbalance of the equities merge.”); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 58–59 \n(2d Cir. 2020).  Enjoining enforcement of the Secretary’s purported termination of the VPPP \nAgreement pending a final decision on the merits is in the public interest. \nPlaintiffs’ “extremely high likelihood of success on the merits is a strong indicator that a \npreliminary injunction would serve the public interest” because “[t]here is generally no public \ninterest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  Newby, 838 F.3d at 12; accord Make the \nRd. New York v. Pompeo, 475 F. Supp. 3d 232, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (“[T]here is no public interest \nin allowing Defendants to proceed with unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious executive or agency \nactions that exceed their statutory authority.”).  “An agency is not harmed by an order prohibiting \nit from violating the law.”  New York, 2025 WL 715621, at *16.  “To the contrary, there is a \nsubstantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern \ntheir existence and operations.’”  Newby, 838 F.3d at 12 (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d \n1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)); accord Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (“Forcing federal agencies to comply with \nthe law is undoubtedly in the public interest.”). \n104 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 105 of 109\nDenying a preliminary injunction would cause Plaintiffs hardship and harm the public by \nendangering the vital transportation infrastructure Plaintiffs provide.  The budget uncertainty \ncaused by Plaintiffs’ predicament interferes with Plaintiffs’ abilities to plan or manage upcoming \nprojects.  See Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 539 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (holding \nthat balance of the harm supported issuance of an injunction because the plaintiffs “have a strong \ninterest in avoiding unconstitutional federal enforcement and the significant budget uncertainty \nthat has resulted from the Order’s broad and threatening language”).  If forced to stop tolling or if \ndenied federal funds, the MTA would be forced to cancel or halt projects designed to promote \naccess to transit for individual with disabilities, to decrease subway delays, and to increase transit \noptions throughout the city.  Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 35.  Absent federal funding or approvals, the NYSDOT \nand NYCDOT would be unable to move forward with numerous projects necessary to ensure \nsmooth and safe operation of the roads in New York.  Dkt. No. 86 ¶¶ 13–14; Dkt. No. 90 ¶¶ 37–\n53.  These projects not only serve important public safety goals but are also critical to the region’s \neconomy by directly employing workers and facilitating transportation throughout the state.  \nForcing Plaintiffs to forego or delay these projects causes Plaintiffs hardship and disserves the \npublic interest.  See New York ex rel. James v. Rescue, 705 F. Supp. 3d 104, 137 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) \n(holding that “ensuring public safety” is in the public interest and weighs in favor of granting \npreliminary injunction); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, 2025 WL 597959, \nat *19 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (subsequent history omitted) (public interest supported preliminary \ninjunction where a pause in funding “placed critical programs for children, the elderly, and \neveryone in between in serious jeopardy”); Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d 267, 298 (W.D. \nLa. 2022) (recognizing that balance of equities and public interest weighed in favor of granting \n105 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 106 of 109\npreliminary injunction where “[l]ocal government funding, jobs for Plaintiff States’ workers, and \nfunds for the restoration of Louisiana’s Coastline are at stake”). \nCeasing operation of the Tolling Program would also harm the public by depriving it of \nthe benefits the Tolling Program creates.  Plaintiffs provide evidence that the Tolling Program has \nled to positive outcomes for the region.  Traffic in the CBD has decreased substantially and \ncommuter time and trip reliability have substantially improved.  Nearly six million fewer vehicles \nentered the CBD in January through March of 2025 than would be expected based on data from \nprevious years.  Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 25(a).  River crossing times improved with commuters who travel \nthrough the Holland Tunnel enjoying 45% faster crossings.  Id. ¶ 25(c)–(d).  Traffic speeds \nimproved by 31% on the Queensboro Bridge and by 26% on the Brooklyn Bridge.  Trip times \nfrom Brooklyn and Queens to the CBD have dropped between 10% and 30%.  Id.  Traffic speeds \nwithin the CBD have increased by 15%.  Id. ¶ 25(h). Commuters are saving as much as 21 minutes \non their trips.  Id.¶ 25(e).  School children are getting to school on time more frequently and are \nregaining up to half an hour of instructional time.  Dkt. No. 115 at 4–5, 8–9.  Retail sales, pedestrian \ntraffic, hotel occupancy, and leasing have all increased.  Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 26.  In sum, the reduction \nin congestion caused by the Tolling Program offers not only superior environmental outcomes, but \nalso  increased  productivity,  improvements  to  health  and  safety,  more  instruction  time  for \nschoolchildren, and beneficial economic outcomes.  Defendants do not seriously contest that the \noperation of the Tolling Programs confers these benefits or that such benefits support a preliminary \ninjunction.  See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d at 87 (concerns of “[r]educed productivity \nand educational attainment” absent injunctive relief support preliminary injunction); New York v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 408 F. Supp. 3d 334, 351 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“[P]reventing the alleged \neconomic and public health harms provides a significant public benefit”), aff’d as modified, 969 \n106 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 107 of 109\nF.3d 42; see also Weed v. Jenkins, 2015 WL 6555413, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Oct. 28, 2015) (recognizing \nthat “promoting safety upon the highways[] and regulating traffic flow” is in the public interest).72   \nDefendants  identify  little  harm  to  the  public  that  would  follow  from  a  preliminary \ninjunction.  They note that there is a public interest in pursuing agency priorities, including that \ntaxpayers should not pay to use federal-aid highways.  Dkt.  No. 118 at 57–58.  Although \nDefendants may have a valid interest in pursuing their preferred transportation policy, the Second \nCircuit has held that absent the need to correct an unlawful previous policy, an agency’s inability \nto implement its preferred policy does not outweigh the “wide-ranging economic harms that await \nthe States” upon implementation of the new policy.  U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d at 87.  \nFurthermore, if it is later determined that Plaintiffs in fact lacked the authority to continue tolling, \nall motorists who paid the toll can be made whole.  The majority of current toll payers (between \n92% and 95%) use E-ZPass.  Dkt. No. 85 ¶ 39.  Plaintiffs may refund any improperly collected \ntolls directly to such drivers by crediting their E-ZPass accounts.  The remaining motorists who \ndo not use E-ZPass can likewise be refunded by the same mechanism they used to pay the bill—\neither refund to a credit card, cash at an authorized payment facility, or check sent by mail.  Id. \n \n72 Defendants cite an article stating that traffic has gone up in some parts of the Bronx.  Dkt. \nNo. 118 at 8–9, 58 (citing Hilary Howard, The South Bronx Has a Pollution Issue. Congestion \nPricing  May  Worsen  It,  N.Y.  Times  (Feb.  2,  2025), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/nyregion/congestion-pricing-air.html).    But  the  article \nsummarizes “preliminary data from the first two weeks of congestion pricing” and states that “[i]t’s \nstill too early to draw any conclusions about traffic in the South Bronx and its link to congestion \npricing.”  Howard, The South Bronx Has a Pollution Issue.  In response, Plaintiffs cite a more \nrecent article which reported that “[t]raffic has not surged in the South Bronx.”  Dkt. No. 124 at \n30 n.26 (citing Emily Bader, Here Is Everything That Has Changed Since Congestion Pricing \nStarted,  N.Y.  Times  (May  11,  2025), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/11/upshot/congestion-pricing.html).    That  more \nrecent article states that “the number of vehicles traveling daily on the Cross Bronx Expressway \nwas down slightly in January through April, compared with last year, according to the New York \nState Department of Transportation” and travel speeds increased during weekday work hours.  See \nBader, Here Is Everything That Has Changed Since Congestion Pricing Started.   \n107 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 108 of 109\n¶ 40.  Given these circumstances, the prospect that individuals will be forced to pay a potentially \ninvalid but refundable toll do not weigh strongly against an injunction. \nPlaintiffs adequately demonstrate that the balance of the equities and the public interest \nweigh in favor of a preliminary injunction. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits for their claims that \nDefendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously by purporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement in \nthe February 19 Letter except for the portion of Plaintiffs’ argument resting upon Defendants’ \nfailure to perform a subsequent NEPA review.  Plaintiffs have adequately shown that they would \nbe irreparably injured absent an injunction, and that the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest support an injunction.  Because each factor weighs in favor of a preliminary injunction, \nPlaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction are GRANTED.  \nConsistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court issues the \nfollowing injunction:  \nDefendants  Sean  Duffy,  in  his  official  capacity  as  Secretary  of  the  United  States \nDepartment of Transportation, Gloria M. Shepherd, in her official capacity as Executive Director \nof the Federal Highway Administration, the United States Department of Transportation, and the \nFederal Highway Administration as well as all persons identified under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(d)(2), including all of Defendants’ respective officers, agents, servants, employees, \nand attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concert or participation with any of the \nforegoing, are enjoined from taking any agency action founded on the February 19, 2025 letter \nfrom Secretary Duffy to Governor Hochul purporting to terminate the VPPP Agreement and \nrescind federal approval for New York’s Central Business District Tolling Program, including any \naction to enforce compliance with or implement (1) the February 19 Letter, (2) Defendants’ \n108 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 132     Filed 05/28/25     Page 109 of 109\npurported termination of the VPPP Agreement, or (3) Defendants’ purported termination of the \nTolling Program.  For the avoidance of doubt, Defendants are enjoined from taking any of the \n“compliance measures” set forth in the April 21, 2025 Letter including withholding federal funds, \napprovals, or authorizations from New York state or local agencies to enforce compliance with or \nimplement  (1) the  February  19  Letter,  (2) Defendants’  purported  termination  of  the  VPPP \nAgreement, or (3) Defendants’ purported termination of the Tolling Program. \nThe Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt. Nos. 82 and 88. \n  SO ORDERED. \n   \n \nDated: May 28, 2025            __________________________________ \n  New York, New York            LEWIS J.

LIMAN, United States District Judge: \n \nOn January 5, 2025, the State of New York, acting with the approval of the federal \ngovernment, initiated a new tolling program to address the vehicular congestion that had long \nplagued the Central Business District of New York City (“CBD”).  The tolling program had been \nyears in the making and represents a cooperative effort by a number of federal, state, and local \nagencies  including  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  (“FHWA”),  the  New  York  State \nDepartment of Transportation (“NYSDOT”), the New York City Department of Transportation \n(“NYCDOT”), the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (“TBTA”), and the Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority (“MTA”).  The FHWA, NYSDOT, TBTA, and NYCDOT entered into \nan agreement that approved the program as a value pricing pilot program pursuant to the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, as amended, and authorized the collection of tolls.  \nDkt. No. 1-1. \nA month and a half later, the federal government began to take steps to end the program.  \nOn February 19, 2025, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy sent a letter to New York State \nGovernor Kathy Hochul stating that he was “rescinding FHWA’s approval” of the congestion \ntolling program and “terminating the Agreement” pursuant to which Plaintiffs implemented the \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 2 of 11\nprogram.  Dkt. No. 87-5.  Secretary Duffy’s letter stated that the basis for termination was his view \nthat the tolling program was not an eligible value pricing pilot program for which tolling could be \nauthorized because it did not provide toll-free alternatives to enter the CBD by vehicle (“cordon \npricing”) and because the project “appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue . . . \nas opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”  Id. at 4.  In response, Plaintiffs filed this suit.  Dkt. \nNo. 1.  On April 21, 2025, Secretary Duffy threatened that if Plaintiffs did not accede to the demand \nthat they end the tolling program or show that it was authorized to continue tolling, the FHWA \nwould take punitive measures including withholding advance construction authorizations, NEPA \napprovals, and approvals for Statewide Transportation Improvement Program amendments.  Dkt. \nNo. 64 at 2.  The letter threatened that continuing “noncompliance” could prompt the FHWA to \nwithhold funds and authorizations for projects throughout the whole of New York City or other \ngeographic regions in New York State.  Id.  \nOn April 23, 2025, attorneys with the United States Department of Justice filed on the \npublic docket an 11-page single-spaced letter (the “Letter”) they had sent to the Department of \nTransportation on April 11, 2025, advising that it was very unlikely that this Court “or further \ncourts of review” would accept Secretary Duffy’s arguments that the tolling program was not a \nstatutorily authorized value pricing pilot program.  Dkt. No. 65 at 1, 8.  The Letter was immediately \nthe subject of widespread media attention.  See Dkt. No. 70 at 2 & nn.1–6 (noting that the letter \nhad been discussed by, inter alia, the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the New York \nPost, AM New York, and New York Magazine).  It was also extensively quoted and discussed on \nradio programs and major broadcast television networks.  See id. at 2 & nn.7–8 (noting that the \nletter had been discussed by, inter alia, WNYC, News 4 NBC New York, CCBS News New York, \nNews10 ABC, and Fox 5 New York). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 3 of 11\nDefendants now seek to have the Letter removed from the docket or permanently sealed on \nthe basis that it is a privileged attorney-client/attorney work product communication that was \ninadvertently filed with the Court.  Dkt. No. 67.1  Defendants’ request raises two issues: (1) whether \nthe Court should permanently seal the Letter; and (2) whether there has been a waiver of the \nprivilege such that Plaintiffs may use the Letter in this litigation. \nThe Second Circuit has acknowledged that once otherwise confidential information is \npublicly filed and has been “disseminated prominently” the Court “simply do[es] not have the \npower, even were [it] of the mind to use it if [it] had, to make what has thus become public private \nagain.”  Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 144 & n.10 (2d Cir. 2004).  Once “[t]he \ngenie is out of the bottle,” the Court “ha[s] not the means to put the genie back.”  Id.  Numerous \ncourts have followed the Circuit in recognizing the impossibility of “mak[ing] private that which \nhas already become public.”  Chigirinskiy v. Panchenkova, 319 F. Supp. 3d 718, 739 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018); see, e.g., Rollag v. Cowen Inc., 2020 WL 4937462, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2020) (“In \nlight of the existing press coverage of the Complaint, the Court concludes that sealing would be \nfutile at this stage.”); In re Application to Unseal 98 Cr. 1101(ILG), 891 F. Supp. 2d 296, 300 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2012) (“Any balancing of the interests here, however, would be academic as the \ninformation the Government and Doe seek to maintain sealed has already been publicly revealed; \nthe cat is out of the bag.”); NXIVM Corp. v. O’Hara, 241 F.R.D. 109, 144 (N.D.N.Y. 2007) (“We \ncannot unsay what has already been said in the public forum.”); United States v. Gangi, 1 F. Supp. \n \n1 On April 24, 2025, at 11:20 AM EST, Defendants filed a letter motion seeking to seal Dkt. No. 65 \non the basis that it had been inadvertently filed.  Dkt. No. 67.  The Court temporarily granted \nDefendants’ sealing request, pending further briefing.  Dkt. No. 69 at 2.  On April 24, 2025, the \nRiders Alliance and Sierra Club filed a letter in opposition to sealing.  Dkt. No. 68.  On May 2, \n2025 Plaintiffs and Intervenors filed letters in opposition to sealing.  See Dkt. No. 70 (the Riders \nAlliance and Sierra Club); Dkt. No. 72 (the MTA and the TBTA); Dkt. No. 74 (NYSDOT).  On \nMay 7, 2025, Defendants filed a letter reply in support of their sealing request.  Dkt. No. 97.  \nPlaintiffs (The MTA, TBTA, NYSDOT, Riders Alliance, and Sierra Club) filed a surreply on May \n8, 2025.  Dkt. No. 101.  Defendants filed a sur-surreply on May 13, 2025.  Dkt. No. 103. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 4 of 11\n2d 256, 267 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (Chin, J.) (“There is no order I can enter which erases from . . . \ncounsel’s knowledge what has been disclosed.” (quoting Int’l Digit. Sys. Corp. v. Digit. Equip. \nCorp., 120 F.R.D. 445, 449 (D. Mass. 1988))).  “Courts in this Circuit thus ‘routinely deny sealing \nrequests where . . . the information to be sealed is already publicly available.’”  United States v. \nPaduch, 2024 WL 167198, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2024) (quoting Grossberg v. Fox Corp., 2023 \nWL 2612262, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2023)) (collecting cases).  That proposition applies squarely \nhere.  The fact and the contents of the Letter have been widely reported by print media outlets, \nradio programs, and network television.  See Dkt. No. 70 at 2 & nn.1–8.  Many have not only \nquoted portions of the letter, but also linked to or republished the document in its entirety.  Id. at 3.  \nThe Court has no means to restore the Letter’s secrecy.2 \nThe sole argument raised by Defendants is that the Letter is not a judicial record to which \nthe presumption of public access attaches.  Dkt. No. 97 at 1–4; see United States v. Amodeo, 44 \nF.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995) (“We think that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court \nis insufficient to render that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access.”).  \nDefendants are correct that the Letter is not a judicial document.  A judicial document is one that \nis “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process in order \nfor it to be designated a judicial document.”  Amodeo, 44 F.3d as 145.  The Letter was not intended \nto have any role in the Court’s decision in this case.  The Court therefore does not apply a \npresumption in favor of access.  See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d \nCir. 2006).  But it does not follow from the fact that the Letter is not a judicial record that the Court \nmust  withdraw  it  from  public  view.    Even  though  the  Letter  is  not  a  judicial  document \n“presumptively open to the public under the Amodeo cases, this conclusion, standing alone, does \n \n2 This case is thus distinguishable from the cases cited by Defendants in which the misfiled \ndocument was not publicized, and thus sealing could preserve the document’s confidentiality.  See \nDkt. No. 97 at 2 (collecting cases). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 5 of 11\nnot end the Court’s inquiry.”  S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir. 2001); see \nNichols v. Noom Inc., 2021 WL 3914078, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2021) (denying motion to redact \nparts of nonjudicial document because the party seeking sealing “has failed to meet its burden to \ndemonstrate any legitimate reason to maintain this information under seal”); SuperCom, Ltd. v. \nSabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund Ltd., 2022 WL 2543788, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2022) \n(denying motion to seal nonjudicial document).  It simply means that the Court must strike “a new \nbalance between privacy rights and the interest of the general public.”  TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at \n234; see also Standard Inv. Chartered, Inc. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., 2008 WL 199537, \nat *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2008) (noting that the party seeking to seal nonjudicial documents “must \ndemonstrate a particularized harm associated with disclosure in order to justify the continued \nsealing of these documents”). \nThe Letter is of broad public interest.  The Secretary has asserted that the law requires him \nto take actions with dramatic public consequences.  Whether his invocation of the law is consistent \nwith the advice he has been given is a matter of public concern.  See N. L. R. B. v. Sears, Roebuck \n& Co., 421 U.S. 132, 152 (1975) (“[T]he public is vitally concerned with the reasons which did \nsupply the basis for an agency policy actually adopted.”).  “[T]he courts of this country recognize \na general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and \ndocuments” that is independent of any “proprietary interest in the document or upon a need for it \nas evidence in a lawsuit.”  Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978) (collecting \ncases).  “The interest necessary to support the issuance of a writ compelling access has been found, \nfor example, in the citizen’s desire to keep a watchful eye on the workings of public agencies, and \nin  a  newspaper  publisher’s  intention  to  publish  information  concerning  the  operation  of \ngovernment.”  Id. at 597–98 (collecting cases).  Defendants’ assertion of privilege stands in the \nway of that interest.  See In re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413, 419 (2d Cir. 2007) (acknowledging \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 6 of 11\nthat  invocation  of  governmental  attorney-client  privilege  “impinges  on  open  and  accessible \ngovernment”); Reed v. Baxter, 134 F.3d 351, 356–57 (6th Cir. 1998) (“The governmental privilege \nstands squarely in conflict with the strong public interest in open and honest government”). \nBy contrast, the Secretary’s interest in keeping the Letter from public view on the Court’s \nwebsite is de minimis.  Traditionally, the governmental attorney-client privilege is countenanced \nby the fact that “public officials are duty-bound to understand and respect constitutional, judicial \nand statutory limitations on their authority; thus, their access to candid legal advice directly and \nsignificantly serves the public interest.”  County of Erie, 473 F.3d at 419.  “Upholding the privilege \nfurthers a culture in which consultation with government lawyers is accepted as a normal, desirable, \nand even indispensable part of conducting public business.”  In re Grand Jury Investigation, 399 \nF.3d 527, 534 (2d Cir. 2005).  Here, however, the Secretary’s interest in receiving the advice in \nconfidence already has been fatally compromised.  “[T]he ex ante incentives for full and frank \nconsultations between clients and counsel” are not compromised by permitting public access to a \ndocument that has already been disclosed and has been highly publicized.  Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. \nCarpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 109 (2009).   \nIndeed, the only effect of sealing the Letter would be to prevent members of the public from \ncomparing the copy of the Letter as reported with that as filed and ascertaining for themselves \nwhether the reports of the advice the Secretary received accurately relay the advice the Secretary \nin fact received.  Such outcome disserves the public and provides no benefit to any party.  See \nBernsten v. O’Reilly, 307 F.Supp.3d 161, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that “[g]eneralized \nconcern[s] of adverse publicity” do not support sealing (quoting Prescient Acquisition Grp., Inc. v. \nMJ Pub. Tr., 487 F.Supp.2d 374, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2007))).  Defendants’ request to seal the Letter is \ndenied.  The public and all parties in this litigation may access the Letter. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 7 of 11\nSeparately, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs should not be able to use the Letter “as \nevidence, or otherwise, in this case,” because the Letter is privileged and its disclosure was \ninadvertent.  Defendants have sustained their burden.   \n  “The attorney-client privilege protects communications (1) between a client and his or her \nattorney (2) that are intended to be, and in fact were, kept confidential (3) for the purpose of \nobtaining or providing legal assistance.”  United States v. Mejia, 655 F.3d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 2011), \ncert. denied, 565 U.S. 992 (2011).  The privilege extends to government counsel as well.  See \nCounty of Erie, 473 F.3d at 418; Grand Jury Investigation, 399 F.3d at 530–36.  The purpose of \nthe governmental attorney-client privilege “is to encourage full and frank communication between \nattorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law \nand administration of justice.”  Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).   \n“[I]t is vital to [such] a claim [of privilege] . . . that the communications between client and \nattorney were made in confidence and have been maintained in confidence.’”  Brennan Ctr. for \nJust. at N.Y.U. Sch. of L. v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 697 F.3d 184, 207 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Mejia, \n655 F.3d at 134).  “As a general rule, the voluntary production of a privileged document waives \nany claim of privilege with respect to that document.”  United States v. Rigas, 281 F.Supp.2d 733, \n737 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  “When a party inadvertently discloses privileged material, however, the \nprivilege will not be deemed waived unless the conduct of the producing party or its counsel \nevinced such extreme carelessness as to suggest that it was not concerned with the protection of \nthe privilege.”  In re Nat. Gas Commodity Litig., 229 F.R.D. 82, 85 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (quotation \nomitted). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 8 of 11\nDefendants have demonstrated that the disclosure was inadvertent.3  The Department of \nJustice attorneys involved in the filing, including the attorney under whose ECF credentials the \ndocument was filed, have represented to the Court under penalty of perjury that the misfiling was \nnot intentional.  Dkt. No. 97 at 5 & n.4.  The docket text that accompanied the filing indicated that \nit was a letter addressing Secretary Duffy’s April 20, 2025, letter to Governor Hochul and the \nCourt’s inquiry as to whether the administrative record would contain documents other than \nSecretary Duffy’s February 19, 2025, letter—a letter that was due to the Court at that time.  Dkt. \nNo. 65.  There is no reason to doubt that the attorneys engaged in a late-night filing simply selected \nthe wrong file for upload, without any intent to make the selected document public.  And the speed \nwith which the attorneys acted to seal the Letter and prevent others from viewing it is inconsistent \nwith an intent to publicize the document.  Defendants telephonically contacted the Clerk of Court \nwithin approximately 15 minutes of the filing to request that the Letter be sealed on an emergency \nbasis, pending a formal motion to seal.  Dkt. No. 67 at 1; Dkt. No. 97 at 6.  Defendants emailed all \ncounsel of record requesting that they not download the Letter, or if they had already downloaded \nit, to delete it.  Dkt. No. 97 at 6. \nTo determine whether an inadvertent disclosure was so careless as to waive the privilege, \ncourts in the Second Circuit balance four factors: (1) the reasonableness of the precautions to \nprevent inadvertent disclosure, (2) the time taken to rectify the error, (3) the scope of the discovery \nand the extent of the disclosure, and (4) the overarching issue of fairness.  See Lois Sportswear, \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss & Co., 104 F.R.D. 103, 105 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); see also United States v. \n \n3 Plaintiffs note that Secretary Duffy has suggested the disclosure was intentional, describing the \nfiling as either “absolute incompetence,” or “sabotage,” or “part of the resistance movement.”  Dkt. \nNo. 72 (citation omitted).  However, his comments do not indicate any firsthand knowledge that \nthe disclosure was a purposeful act and thus are not competent evidence of the intent of the \nprofessionals involved.  The Secretary’s comments do not undermine the Court’s finding of \ninadvertence.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 9 of 11\nRay, 2022 WL 842254, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2022).  Courts apply the Lois framework even \nwhere the inadvertent disclosure takes the form of a filing rather than document production.  See, \ne.g., Gangi, 1 F. Supp. 2d at 264. \nOnly the third factor supports waiver—the filing itself was not large in scope.  Counsel \nneeded to file only two documents (one letter and one exhibit to the letter).  But that will generally \nbe the case where a misfiled document comprises the disclosure.  And although it is easier to review \na small filing than a voluminous document production, occasional errors will not alone indicate \nextreme carelessness.  See Prescient Partners, L.P. v. Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc., 1997 WL 736726, \nat *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 26, 1997) (holding that “it would be inappropriate for the client of producing \ncounsel to suffer the waiver of privilege due to an isolated, inadvertent error” (quotation and \nalterations omitted)); see also Mazzocchi v. Windsor Owners Corp., 2020 WL 4038342, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2020) (“[T]he filing error made by an employee of Defendants’ counsel’s law \nfirm[] is not a basis for finding waiver of the sacrosanct attorney-client privilege.”). \nThe remaining factors weigh far more strongly against waiver.  Counsel for Defendants \ntook reasonable precautions to avoid waiver, including limiting access to a few government \nagencies and to the attorneys handling the case.  Dkt. No. 97 at 5.  There is no indication that any \npart of the filing process was undertaken in a careless manner.  The filing process provides limited \nopportunities for review, and Defendants are far from the only litigants who have submitted \nincorrect documents to the Court.  Counsel acted swiftly to rectify the disclosure by contacting the \nClerk of Court with an emergency sealing request and by contacting counsel of record.  It is hard \nto imagine they could have acted faster or done anything more to prevent dissemination.4   \n \n4 Although Plaintiffs point out that there is no evidence that Defendant contacted third parties to \nrequest that they delete any republished versions of the Letter, Dkt. No. 72 at 2, it is not apparent \nthat Defendants had any means of doing so quickly.  Defendants state that identifying which third \nparties had viewed the document prior to emergency sealing would have required subpoenaing \nPACER.  Dkt. No. 97 at 6 n.6.  And even if Defendants had quickly identified the third parties that \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 10 of 11\nFinally, there is no indication that it would be “unfair” to bar the parties from using the \nLetter in this litigation.  By confirming that the document is still privileged, “the Court takes \nnothing away” from Plaintiffs.  Rigas, 281 F. Supp. 2d at 742; see Ray, 2022 WL 842254, at *4 \n(holding that “any unfairness to defendant by the deprivation of information to which it was not \noriginally entitled is far outweighed by the unfairness to [the witness] in not honoring the attorney-\nclient and psychotherapist-patient privileges” (quotation omitted)); In re Copper Mkt. Antitrust \nLitig., 200 F.R.D. 213, 223 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“Depriving a party of information in an otherwise \nprivileged document is not prejudicial.”).5  Defendants have not undertaken any action that would \nput the advice in the Letter at issue.6  As to the legal arguments articulated in the Letter, there was \nnever a concern that the experienced counsel in this case would need to freeload off the arguments \nof the United States Attorney’s Office.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs have already filed their opening \nbriefs in support of a preliminary injunction without relying upon the Letter; even if Plaintiffs had \nwished to mine the Letter for legal arguments, there is no argument expressed in the Letter that \nwould have been additive to the arguments Plaintiffs already stated in their opening briefs.  Dkt. \nNos. 83, 89.  And the MTA and TBTA have argued that Secretary Duffy’s February 19 letter—\n \nhad accessed the document, it is not obvious Defendants could have requested deletion with any \nexpectation that the third parties would honor the request.  The press is generally free to publish \ninformation it has lawfully acquired.  See Neb. Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 570 (1976); see \nalso Dkt. No. 97 at 6 n.8 (noting that the CourtListener.com “removal policy” states that “[i]f you \nwant information deleted from our site, your only recourse is to get it deleted from the public record \nand to obtain a court order demanding that we do the same”).  \n5 Plaintiffs cite Rigas for the proposition that “[g]enerally, courts hold that fairness dictates a \nfinding of waiver in cases where the privileged information at issue has been widely disseminated.”  \nDkt. No. 101 at 3 (citing Rigas, 281 F. Supp. 2d at 741); see also S.E.C. v. Cassano, 189 F.R.D. \n83, 86 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Gangi, 1 F. Supp. 2d at 264.  However, that proposition arises in the \ncontext of multi-defendant government prosecution where some defendants have reviewed the \ninformation at issue while others have not.  See Rigas, 281 F. Supp. 2d at 741; Cassano, 189 F.R.D. \nat 86; Gangi, 1 F. Supp. 2d at 267.  In such circumstances, the defendants who have not reviewed \nthe information may be prejudiced vis-à-vis the defendants who have.  See Rigas, 281 F. Supp. 2d \nat 741–42.  That issue is not presented here, because there is no worry any plaintiff may gain an \nunfair advantage with respect to any other plaintiff. \n6 If Defendants take action to put the advice at issue, Plaintiffs may seek reconsideration. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 106     Filed 05/14/25     Page 11 of 11\nwhich predated the Letter—is the purported basis for Defendants’ challenged actions.  Dkt. No. 83 \nat 24.  This is thus not a situation in which the disclosed communication reveals facts “that differ \nmarkedly from the factual position [the disclosing party] has taken in this action.”  Atronic Int’l, \nGMBH v. SAI Semispecialists of Am., Inc., 232 F.R.D. 160, 166 (E.D.N.Y. 2005).  “The prejudice \nfactor  focuses only on  whether the act of restoring immunity to an inadvertently disclosed \ndocument  would  be  unfair,  not  whether  the  privilege  itself  deprives  parties  of  pertinent \ninformation.”  Bank Brussels Lambert v. Credit Lyonnais (Suisse) S.A., 160 F.R.D. 437, 446 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1995).  The fact that Secretary Duffy received a communication from counsel taking a \nmore negativistic view of his legal approach and recommending alternatives may be of interest to \nPlaintiffs and the public, but Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that maintaining privilege prejudices \nthem in this litigation.   \nThe Letter therefore shall remain privileged and may not be used in this litigation. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants’ motion to seal is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The Letter \nshall be unsealed, but it shall remain privileged such that Plaintiffs and Intervenors may not use it \nin this litigation. \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to unseal Dkt. No. 65. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: May 14, 2025            __________________________________ \n  New York, New York            LEWIS J. LIMAN \n                   United States District Judge  ",

Liman   \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \n500 Pearl Street, Courtroom 15C \nNew York, NY 10007 \n \nRe:    Metropolitan Transportation Authority, et al. v. Duffy, et al., No. 25 Civ. 1413 \n(LJL) \n \nDear Judge Liman: \nThis Office represents defendants Sean Duffy, in his official capacity as Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Gloria M. Shepherd, in her official capacity \nas Executive Director of the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), DOT, and FHWA \n(together the “Federal Defendants”) in the above-referenced matter.  We write respectfully in \naccordance with the Court’s April 9, 2025 Order directing Defendants to inform the Court \n“whether they anticipate the administrative record to include any documents other than Secretary \nDuffy’s letter dated February 19 2025.” ECF No. 57.  We also include herein an update regarding \nrecent developments relevant to this matter.   \nAs the Parties previously advised, FHWA extended the deadline for New York to cease \ncollection of tolls under the New York Central Business District Tolling Program (“CBDTP”) and \nto provide information about the cessation of tolling until April 20, 2025.  See ECF No. 49 at 11.  \nNew York did not respond to FHWA’s request for information by April 20, 2025.  Thus, on April \n21, 2025, Secretary Duffy sent a letter to New York Governor Kathy Hochul directing the New \nYork State Department of Transportation (“NYSDOT”) to “submit a response to FHWA’s New \nYork Division Administrator that either: (1) certifies that the collection of tolls under the CBDTP \nhas ceased; or (2) demonstrates that the continued collection of tolls does not violate 23 U.S.C. § \n301” by May 21, 2025.  See April 21, 2025 Letter, attached hereto as Exhibit A.  The letter further \nadvises that if, after evaluating the response from NYSDOT and any responses from TBTA and \nNYCDOT, FHWA makes a determination that New York is out of compliance with 23 U.S.C. § \n301, it may take certain measures to bring New York into compliance beginning on or after May \n28, 2025.   \nAt this juncture, Federal Defendants can confirm that the administrative record will include \nseveral documents in addition to Secretary Duffy’s February 19, 2025 letter.1 As noted above, \n \n1 The Federal Defendants expect that, among other things, the entirety of the administrative record \n(including supplements) submitted in connection with the Court’s review of the NEPA analysis \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01413-LJL     Document 66     Filed 04/23/25     Page 2 of 2\n2 \n \nhowever, the agency decision-making process is ongoing.  Accordingly, Federal Defendants have \ndetermined that the administrative record cannot be compiled in full until the completion of that \nprocess, which will include an opportunity for FHWA to review and consider any materials \nsubmitted by NYSDOT, TBTA, and/or NYCDOT by the May 21, 2025 deadline prior to making \na final determination as to whether the collection of tolls under the CBDTP violates 23 U.S.C. § \n301.  \nGiven  these  developments,  Federal  Defendants  agree  to  confer  with  Plaintiffs  and \nIntervenor Plaintiffs regarding how these developments will impact the case schedule previously \nentered by the Court, ECF No. 57.  \nThank you for your attention to this matter. \nRespectfully, \n \nJAY CLAYTON \nUnited States Attorney \n \nBy:   /s/ Dominika Tarczynska  \nDOMINIKA TARCZYNSKA \nDAVID FARBER  \nCHRISTINE S.
