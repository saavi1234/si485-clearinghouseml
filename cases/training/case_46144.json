    "summary": "<p>This case challenged President Trump&rsquo;s alleged authority to unilaterally revoke environmental protections and open offshore areas to oil and gas leasing. On January 6, 2025, President Biden permanently withdrew certain areas of the United States&rsquo; outer continental shelf in the Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico from future oil and gas leasing. On January 20, 2025, an executive order issued by President Trump purported to strip those protections. Plaintiffs alleged this EO and defendants&rsquo; subsequent implementation actions exceeded presidential authority in violation of the Constitution, unlawfully revoked protections for offshore areas previously withdrawn from oil and gas leasing under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), and threatened protected marine species and ecosystems in violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA).</p>\r\n<p>On February 19, 2025, the Northern Alaska Environmental Center and nine other environmental organizations brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska. The lawsuit named President Trump, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Commerce as defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs argued that OCSLA grants the President authority to withdraw lands from leasing but does not grant authority to revoke prior withdrawals, making Trump&rsquo;s executive order <em>ultra vires</em> (i.e., beyond his legal authority) and thus unconstitutional. Additionally, plaintiffs claimed that due to separation of powers, only Congress can modify OCSLA withdrawals&mdash;not the President alone. Plaintiffs also asserted that a resumption of offshore drilling would harm protected species such as polar bears, whales, and sea turtles, violating the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Finally, the complaint alleged violations of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to the environmental impacts of expanded oil and gas leasing.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs, represented by Earthjustice, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of Trump&rsquo;s executive order and to block any new offshore oil and gas leasing in the affected regions. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Sharon Louise Gleason.</p>\r\n<p>On February 20, 2025, plaintiffs provided notice of a related case, <em>League of Conservation Voters v. Trump</em>, &nbsp;which had challenged a similar order by President Trump during his first term but was mooted by President Biden&rsquo;s electoral defeat of Trump and subsequent rescission of Trump&rsquo;s order in January 2021. (That related case, No. 3:17-cv-00101-SLG, is not yet in the Clearinghouse.)</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2025, the court granted a motion by the American Petroleum Institute (API) to intervene as a defendant. On June 16, 2025, plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint adding the Conservation Law Foundation as a named plaintiff. On June 17, 2025, the court granted a motion by the State of Alaska to intervene as a defendant.</p>\r\n<p>On May 27, 2025, defendants moved to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that plaintiffs lack standing; that their claims were not yet ripe; that their claims against President Trump were barred by sovereign immunity; and that their claims against the Secretaries of Interior and of Commerce should fail for a lack of final agency action. The court&rsquo;s decision on that motion is pending.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

This action arises from President Donald Trump’s unlawful attempt to \nundo permanent protections for certain areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf in \nthe Arctic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico,1 put in place \nby President Joe Biden during his term as the 46th president of the United States. \nCiting the principle of responsible public stewardship and the need to protect \nirreplaceable marine and coastal ecosystems, coastal communities, and subsistence \nuses from the harms of oil and gas development and the devastating and \nirreversible consequences of climate change, President Biden withdrew these areas \nfrom future oil and gas leasing pursuant to his authority under Section 12(a) of the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a). Section \n12(a) authorizes presidents to withdraw unleased public lands on the U.S. Outer \nContinental Shelf (“OCS”) from disposition, including through leasing. Neither \nOCSLA nor any other provision of law authorizes Presidents to undo such \nwithdrawals. \n2.  Plaintiffs have long advocated for protecting Outer Continental Shelf \nareas from oil and gas development. On the first day of his presidential term, \n \n1 On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14172 to start a process \nto rename this area as the “Gulf of America.”  90 Fed. Reg. 8629 (Jan. 31, 2025). This \nComplaint refers to this area as the “Gulf of Mexico” in accordance with the name in \neffect at the time all the relevant actions were taken and reflected on all relevant \ndocuments in this case. \nCOMPLAINT \nN.

In 2023, President \nBiden added protections for the nearshore Beaufort Sea in Alaska. Finally, on \nJanuary 6, 2025, President Biden issued two memoranda withdrawing areas in the \nPacific, Atlantic, Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, and Northern Bering Sea in \nAlaska, providing protections that had significant local and political support. \n3.  Nevertheless, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14148 entitled “Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and \nActions” that purported to reverse all of the withdrawals made by President \nBiden.2  The Department of the Interior has already taken steps to implement this \nExecutive Order and to promote oil and gas development in these affected areas of \nthe OCS. However, President Trump’s order exceeds his constitutional authority \nand his statutory authority under OCSLA and is therefore ultra vires and unlawful. \nPlaintiffs Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Alaska Wilderness League, \nOceana, Inc., Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Healthy Gulf, Center for \n \n2 With respect to parts of the Arctic Ocean and Atlantic canyons, President Trump’s \nexecutive order revives his 2017 revocation of President Obama’s 2015 and 2016 \nwithdrawals.

OCSLA governs the leasing, exploration, and development of oil and \ngas deposits in the Outer Continental Shelf. 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq. The OCS \nextends from the outer boundary of state waters, typically three nautical miles from \nshore, to the outer boundary of the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone, 200 \nnautical miles from shore. Id. §§ 1301(a)(2), 1331(a); 48 Fed. Reg. 10605 (Mar. \n14, 1983). The federal OCS consists in total of approximately 2.5 billion acres.  \n25.  OCSLA charges the Secretary of the Interior with managing oil and \ngas activities on the Outer Continental Shelf. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1334(a), 1344(a). \nManagement of the Outer Continental Shelf “shall be conducted in a manner which \nconsiders economic, social, and environmental values of the renewable and \nCOMPLAINT \nN.

OCSLA further directs that offshore development shall be “subject to \nenvironmental safeguards,” consistent with “national needs,” and operations \nshould be conducted so as to “prevent or minimize … damage to the environment.”  \nId. § 1332(3), (6).  \n26.  Under this framework, OCSLA Section 12(a) provides that “[t]he \nPresident of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition \nany of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.”  43 U.S.C. § 1341(a).  \n27.  For areas not so withdrawn and otherwise open to disposition of \nfederal mineral rights, OCSLA establishes distinct stages for oil and gas \ndevelopment activities:  (1) the development of a five-year leasing program, (2) \nissuance of oil and gas leases, (3) approval of lessees’ exploration plans, and (4) \napproval of lessees’ development and production plans. 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.; \n30 C.F.R. Parts 550, 551.  \n28.  Certain exploration activities, such as seismic exploration, can occur \nat any time before or during these stages in accordance with regulations established \npursuant to, inter alia, the Secretary of the Interior’s rulemaking authority. 43 \nU.S.C. §§ 1334(a), 1340(a), (b), (g); see also 30 C.F.R.

OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF AREAS THREATENED BY \nPRESIDENT TRUMP’S EXECUTIVE ORDER \n29.  President Trump’s Executive Order 14148 purports to reopen several \nareas of the Outer Continental Shelf in the nearshore Beaufort Sea, Atlantic Ocean, \nPacific Ocean, and Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas leasing. \nThese areas had been withdrawn from such activities by President Biden.  \n30.  In Alaska, the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas constitute America’s Arctic \nOcean. With their federal waters still essentially undeveloped, they border \nsensitive federal lands and provide habitat to a rich array of unique wildlife species \nincluding polar bears, walruses, whales, seals, and numerous other mammals, \nbirds, and fish, some of them classified as threatened or endangered. Some of these \nanimals also support thriving indigenous Alaska Native cultural and subsistence \nactivities. Several Arctic mammals, including polar bears and bearded seals, have \nbeen listed under the ESA because of global warming threats to the sea ice on \nwhich they rely for crucial life functions such as foraging and raising young; they \nand numerous other imperiled species are also protected under the MMPA. Many \nArctic species of birds, which migrate to and from the region’s waters annually in \nthe millions, are also threatened by global warming. The region is remote and \nsubject to extreme weather. In winter, the seas are covered in ice and shrouded in \ndarkness. Even in summer, ice can encroach with little notice, and the seas are \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 115      Filed 02/19/25     Page 16 of 46\n\nprone to storms and fog. There is little infrastructure in the region to support \nindustrial activity. The coastal region contains only eight small communities, \nunconnected to one another, or the rest of Alaska, by roads. It mostly lacks jet \nrunways, has no deepwater ports, and is hundreds of miles from the nearest Coast \nGuard station.  \n31.  In the Pacific Ocean, federal OCS waters are home to globally \nsignificant marine environments that provide enormous ecological, scientific, and \neconomic benefits. California alone has five National Marine Sanctuaries – \nMonterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Greater Farallones National Marine \nSanctuary, Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, Channel Islands National \nMarine Sanctuary, and the recently-designated Chumash Heritage National Marine \nSanctuary—that are rich in natural and scenic resources and are the basis for some \nof the state’s largest economic drivers. These areas contain an extremely rich and \ndiverse array of marine species, making them ideal places for viewing whales, sea \notters, seals, sea lions, sea turtles, seabirds and other wildlife. Species such as the \ngrey whale span the entire Pacific coast, making an annual migration of more than \n10,000 miles between their wintering and calving areas in Baja California, Mexico \nand their summer feeding grounds in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas in \nAlaska. California’s direct ocean-based economy is nationally significant for \ntourism, marine transport, recreation, and commercial and recreational fisheries. \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 116      Filed 02/19/25     Page 17 of 46\n\n32.  Federal OCS waters in the Atlantic Ocean are also home to important \nand sensitive marine species and constitute a marine environment very largely still \nunmarked by industrial development. They contain highly diverse habitats and \nharbor important fish and shellfish populations. The waters of the Atlantic \ncontinental shelf furnish nurseries, feeding grounds, and transit routes for marine \nanimals. Among their unique and outstanding geological features are dozens of \nundersea canyons, some of them 100 miles long and deeper than the Grand \nCanyon, rich in marine life. Incised into the continental shelf, these canyons \nsupport cold-water corals hundreds of years old, multitudes of whale species, \nswordfish, bluefin tuna, sea turtles, seabirds, crustaceans, and methane-dependent \norganisms known only from such canyons. The surrounding seafloor and \ncontinental slope break comprise a vast biodiversity hotspot, a mixing zone of \ncurrents and sharp temperature gradients, and underlie an internationally known \nwhale migration corridor that connects feeding grounds in the Gulf of Maine to \ncalving areas offshore Florida. Businesses along the U.S. Atlantic coast— \nincluding fishing, tourism, and recreation industries—are heavily dependent on the \nhealth of this ocean ecosystem and are major contributors to the region’s economy.  \n33.  The Gulf of Mexico is one of the most productive and biodiverse \necosystems in the United States, providing a home to thousands of species ranging \nfrom simple invertebrates to highly evolved marine mammals including dolphins \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 117      Filed 02/19/25     Page 18 of 46\n\nand whales. The Gulf includes habitat for five of the world’s seven species of sea \nturtles and is the exclusive home of the critically endangered Rice’s whale, a \nspecies that scientists estimate may have only 50 individuals remaining. Millions \nof people who live in Gulf Coast states depend on this productive marine \nenvironment to support coastal fisheries, tourism, and recreational opportunities. \nThe Gulf supports robust commercial fisheries, which generate $6.9 billion in \nannual income and provide more than 20 percent of total commercial and \nrecreational fishing harvests each year. Fishing and shrimping are also part of the \ntraditional livelihoods and culture of many Gulf communities. \nII.  THREATS FROM OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND \nDEVELOPMENT \n34.  Oil and gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf has \nsignificant, wide-ranging adverse impacts on these ecosystems and the nearby \ncoastal environments. For example, the deafening sounds generated by pre-lease \nand on-lease seismic surveys and drilling activities disturb and injure marine \nanimals. The heightened risk of oil spills from exploratory and development \ndrilling puts marine life and human activities dependent on it at risk. Vessels, \nfixed-winged aircraft, and helicopters used in oil and gas activities also adversely \naffect ocean species, sometimes fatally. Air and water pollution from oil and gas \noperations and associated infrastructure harm public health and have significant \neffects on tribes and environmental justice communities. \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 118      Filed 02/19/25     Page 19 of 46\n\n35.  Plaintiffs are all too familiar with the adverse impacts of OCS oil and \ngas development. The Gulf of Mexico experienced its worst ecological disaster in \nApril 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank, killing eleven \npeople and causing major environmental damage. See generally In re Oil Spill by \nOil Rig “Deepwater Horizon” in Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20, 2010, 21 F. Supp. 3d \n657, 667 (E.D. La. 2014). The Deepwater Horizon explosion caused oil to gush \nfrom the well on the seabed, nearly 5,000 feet below the ocean’s surface for \nmonths until the well finally was capped in mid-July 2010. The result was the \nlargest oil spill in the history of the United States and a cleanup and containment \neffort that at its height enlisted 50,000 workers on land and sea. Over the 87 days \nduring which the well remained uncapped, over 100 million gallons of oil and \nunquantified amounts of natural gas flowed freely into the Gulf. In an effort to \nbreak apart large concentrations of oil, responders released 1 million gallons of \ntoxic dispersants into Gulf waters. The spill contaminated over 112,000 square \nkilometers of ocean waters and over 2,100 kilometers of shoreline in the Gulf.  \n36.  Scientists estimate the spill caused death or serious harm to billions, if \nnot trillions, of animals, including over 100,000 individuals of species listed as \nthreatened or endangered. The Rice’s whale, for example, experienced a 22 percent \npopulation decline as a result of the disaster, and it has not and may not ever \nrecover. The spill marred coastal and bottom habitats, causing severe damage to \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 119      Filed 02/19/25     Page 20 of 46\n\nthe ecosystems that support the Gulf’s biodiversity. The harm from the spill to \nmarine and coastal species and the environment persists to this day. In the Atlantic, \na spill equivalent to the Deepwater Horizon disaster could coat beaches stretching \nfrom Savannah to Boston. \n37.  Interior has previously found that if just one major lease in the \nArctic’s Chukchi Sea were developed, there would be a 75 percent chance of an oil \nspill of greater than 1,000 barrels in this sensitive region. No response technologies \nreliably result in recovery or containment of even half of the oil from a large \noffshore spill in any region. The three primary oil spill response methods—\nmechanical containment and recovery, in situ burning, and dispersants—would \nlikely be particularly ineffective and damaging in the Arctic. \n38.  Offshore spills have caused similar harms along the Pacific coast. In \nJanuary 1969, the nation’s first large offshore oil spill occurred in the Santa \nBarbara Channel after a blow-out on Platform A in the Dos Cuadras Offshore Oil \nField. Within a ten-day period, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of crude oil \nspilled into the Santa Barbara Channel and onto the beaches of Southern California \nbetween Goleta and Ventura, as well as the shores of the four northern Channel \nIslands. The spill had a significant impact on marine life, killing thousands of sea \nbirds and marine mammals such as dolphins, elephant seals, and sea lions. All \ncommercial fishing was suspended and tourism suffered. Property damage along \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J.

The spill was also a factor in the passage of both the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act. The \nspill still ranks as the third largest in U.S. history after the 2010 Deepwater \nHorizon and 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spills, and remains the largest oil spill to have \noccurred in the waters off California. \n39.  More recently, in 2015, as much as 451,000 gallons of crude oil \nspilled from Plains All American Pipeline near Refugio State Beach in Santa \nBarbara County, with at least 21,000 gallons flowing into the Pacific Ocean. \nThousands of birds and marine mammals were killed and 138 square miles of \nfisheries were closed for six weeks. The pipeline was used to transport oil and gas \ndeveloped from California’s OCS.  \n40.  In October 2021, the San Pedro Bay Pipeline (Pipeline P00547) broke \nand spilled crude oil into the waters 4.5 miles offshore of Huntington Beach, \nCalifornia. Failure of the pipeline may have been caused by the anchor of a ship \nthat hooked the pipeline, causing a partial tear. An estimated 24,696 gallons of oil \nwere spilled into San Pedro Bay. The oil spill affected ocean waters, rocky \nintertidal habitats, subtidal habitats, sandy beaches, and sensitive marsh habitats as \nwell as fish, birds, invertebrates, and marine mammals. The spill also closed \nmultiple beaches and harbors, and impacted outdoor recreation and fishing. \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 211      Filed 02/19/25     Page 22 of 46\n\n41.  One of the initial impacts that would result from reopening OCS areas \nto oil and gas development would be from the use of seismic airgun surveys. \nSeismic surveying is often conducted two to four years prior to lease sales to \nidentify areas with promising oil and gas prospects, although companies also have \nsought approval to conduct seismic surveys even when lease sales are more than \nfour years away and not included in an existing or proposed five-year program. As \ntechnology advances, companies frequently conduct surveying in areas already \nsubjected to previous surveying. \n42.  These surveys typically deploy arrays of airguns, which are towed \nbehind ships across broad swaths of the ocean. While seismic surveys are useful \nfor oil and gas prospecting, they have devastating impacts on marine life. Seismic \nairgun arrays fire intense blasts of energy into the water about every 10 to 12 \nseconds for days, weeks, or months at a time depending on the length of the \nsurvey. A large seismic array can produce effective levels of sound—above 250 \ndecibels—greater than that of virtually any other man-made source, save \nexplosives. These noise blasts penetrate deep into the seafloor and rebound to the \nsurface for analysis. \n43.  Noise from seismic operations harms and harasses marine mammals. \nIf animals are exposed to high enough levels of sound, such as those that exist \nclose to some seismic airguns, they can suffer shifts in hearing thresholds and \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 212      Filed 02/19/25     Page 23 of 46\n\nhearing loss that may result in mortality. Noise at lower levels also causes many \nmarine mammal species to alter their natural behavior in ways that interfere with \nvital activities, including avoiding feeding areas, diverting their migratory paths, \nseparating mothers and young, and impeding communication among individuals. \nIn July 2014, when Interior issued a Record of Decision that opened most federal \nwaters in the Mid- and South Atlantic to seismic oil and gas exploration, it \nestimated that these activities could result in as many as 138,000 injuries and 13.4 \nmillion disturbances of marine mammals, including disruptions in vital behaviors \nsuch as feeding and mating, over the first nine years.  \n44.  Seismic surveys also harm commercially important fish and shellfish. \nThe intense sound pressures produced by industry’s airguns can injure or kill fish \nwith swim bladders or other gas-filled chambers, and the particle motion of the \npowerful sound through the water can damage the hearing and sensory capabilities \nof both fish and invertebrates. At lower intensities, the same sounds can also \nproduce a physical stress response. Over time, this stress response to seismic sound \ncan degrade health and fitness and increase mortality. Seismic airgun disruption to \nfish behavior over large areas of ocean is associated with dramatic reductions in \ndocumented catch rates of commercially important fish. Depression of catch rates \ncan persist well after a seismic survey has ended. \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J.

When the Arctic Ocean was not withdrawn from leasing, the oil \nindustry conducted large-scale seismic surveying there. In the Arctic, these surveys \ncovered tens of thousands of square miles, including in the nearshore Beaufort Sea. \nThe nearshore Beaufort Sea area has high oil and gas resource potential and is \nadjacent to existing state oil and gas activity and infrastructure, including the Trans \nAlaska Pipeline System that transports Arctic oil to market. Before it was \nwithdrawn from leasing, oil companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars in \nseismic surveying, leasing, exploration drilling, and development plans in the area. \nHilcorp is currently producing oil from several leases in this OCS area through its \nNorthstar development, and, before the Ninth Circuit vacated the decision, the \nBureau of Ocean Energy Management approved another oil development, called \nLiberty, in the area. \n46.  Industry continues to be interested in the Beaufort Sea area. The State \nof Alaska’s 2024 Beaufort Sea lease sale, held after the 2024 presidential election \nin nearshore Alaska state waters, was its most successful lease sale since at least \n2018. The Beaufort sale drew 33 bids, including bids competing over the same \ntracts, and it issued 20 leases, at an estimated bonus bid value of over $9 million. \nBids came from multiple companies, including a company new to Alaska that was \nformed initially to explore the Gulf of Mexico “to discover and produce new oil \nCOMPLAINT \nN.

OCS ACTIVITIES AND ATTEMPTS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP TO \nEXPAND DRILLING \n47.  In January 2017, prior to President Trump’s first term, Interior \nfinalized a 2017–2022 five-year leasing program that scheduled 11 potential lease \nsales in two program areas: 10 sales in the combined Gulf of Mexico Program \nArea, and one sale in the Cook Inlet Program Area offshore Alaska.3  No lease \nsales were scheduled for the Arctic, Pacific or Atlantic OCS areas. \n48.  However, on July 3, 2017, the Trump administration published a \nRequest for Information and Comments on the Preparation of a new 2019–2024 \nNational Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program to replace the \n2017–2022 program. 82 Fed. Reg. 30886. This process was designed to implement \nPresident Trump’s “America-First Offshore Energy Strategy,” as outlined in \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 13795 of April 28, 2017, and Secretarial Order 3350 of \nMay 1, 2017, which called for enhancing opportunities for energy exploration, \nleasing, and development of the OCS. Id. In the information request, Interior \n \n3 Memorandum from Walter D.

Id.  \n49.  In comments on the information request, industry groups led by the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute stated that: “all OCS areas with the potential to \ngenerate jobs and new revenue by advancing America’s energy renaissance should \nbe considered for inclusion in the Draft Proposed Program. Anything less \nundermines the comprehensive process set forth in the OCS Lands Act and could \nhave significant impacts on U.S. energy policy options well into the future.

Following President Trump’s April 28, 2017 Executive Order, one \nseismic industry trade group called for seismic surveying to proceed “without \ndelay” in order to “allow for informed decisions as a new five-year lease plan is \ndeveloped.”  In the Atlantic, at least six seismic operation companies applied to \nBOEM for permits to conduct “deep-penetration seismic surveys,” deploying large \nairgun arrays to prospect for oil and gas deposits miles beneath the seafloor.

The proposed surveys \nwould have covered many of the same ocean areas, repeatedly exposing the same \nwildlife populations to disruptive high-intensity sound. Collectively, the \napplications submitted to NMFS proposed to run more than 126,000 linear \nkilometers of airgun surveys during the first year of exploration activity in the \nregion.  \n51.  In January 2018, the Trump administration released its 2019–2024 \ndraft proposed program for OCS leasing, proposing 47 total offshore lease sales, \nincluding 19 in the Alaska region and seven in the Pacific region. 83 Fed.

Although the current five-year program does not expire until 2029, \nPresident Trump, according to press reports, is planning to “quickly reopen five-\nyear drilling plans off the U.S. coast to include more lease sales.”5 This is \nconsistent with President Trump’s campaign promise to “Drill, baby, drill,” and \n“[m]ake America the dominant energy producer in the world, by far!”6 \n55.

PRESIDENTIAL WITHDRAWALS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP’S \nATTEMPTS AT REVERSAL \n58.  There is a long history of presidential withdrawals from oil and gas \nleasing under OCSLA, both permanent and time-limited, dating back to 1960, \nwhen President Eisenhower withdrew areas of the Key Largo Coral Reef Preserve, \nnow part of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Since Eisenhower first \nutilized Section 12(a), Presidents Nixon (through his Secretary of the Interior), \n \n9 Rachel Frazen, Trump formally establishes new energy council, The Hill (Feb. 14, \n2025), https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5146202-trump-american-energy-\ncouncil-burgum/. \nCOMPLAINT \nN.

Bush, Obama, Biden, and even \nPresident Trump have all issued withdrawals. Some of these covered large areas:  \nPresident Clinton’s withdrawals covered 300 million acres, while President \nBiden’s withdrawals covered more than 625 million acres. Presidents have also \nused their withdrawal power in protected areas, such as marine sanctuaries, to \npermanently bar oil and gas leasing. \n59.  Until 2017, no president had ever attempted to undo or reverse a prior \nwithdrawal of Outer Continental Shelf areas, other than one with an express end \ndate.  \n60.  On January 27, 2015, President Obama permanently withdrew coastal \nareas in the Arctic’s Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and the Hanna Shoal region in the \nChukchi Sea from oil and gas leasing. The President acted pursuant to the authority \nvested in him by Congress through Section 12(a). The President cited the critical \nimportance of these areas to subsistence use by Alaska Natives as well as for \nmarine mammals, other wildlife, and wildlife habitat. He stated his intention to \nensure that the unique resources of these areas remain available for future \ngenerations. \n61.  On December 9, 2016, as part of his creation of a Northern Bering Sea \nClimate Resilience area, President Obama permanently withdrew areas of the \nNorthern Bering Sea from future oil or gas leasing. The President acted pursuant to \nCOMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase NoC. 3a:s2e5 3-c:2v5--0c0v0-03080 38     Document 311      Filed 02/19/25     Page 32 of 46\n\nthe authority vested in him by Congress through Section 12(a), and stated that the \nwithdrawal “furthers the principles of responsible public stewardship entrusted to \nthis office and takes due consideration of the importance of the withdrawn area to \nAlaska Native tribes, wildlife, and wildlife habitat, and the need for regional \nresiliency in the face of climate change.” \n62.  On December 20, 2016, President Obama permanently withdrew \nadditional portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in Alaska, as well as 26 \nmajor canyons and canyon complexes offshore the Atlantic coast, from future oil \nand gas leasing and any resulting exploration and development. The President \nacted pursuant to the authority vested in him by Congress through Section 12(a), \nagain stating the importance of these ecosystems and their unique resources, and \nwell as the principle of responsible public stewardship.  \n63.  However, following the change in presidential administrations, \nPresident Trump issued an executive order on April 28, 2017, entitled \n“Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.” Exec. Order No. \n13795, 82 Fed. Reg. 20815 (May 3, 2017). Section 4(c) of that order purported to \nrevoke President Obama’s December 9, 2016 withdrawal of areas of the Northern \nBering Sea. Id. at 20816. Section 5 of that order purported to reverse President \nObama’s January 27, 2015, and December 20, 2016, withdrawals in the Atlantic \nand Arctic Oceans. Id. \nCOMPLAINT \nN.

On the first business day following President Trump’s issuance of \nExecutive Order 13785, the Secretary of the Interior issued Secretarial Order No. \n3350 to implement it. The secretarial order called for expedited consideration of \nseismic permitting applications for the Atlantic Ocean, establishment, in \ncooperation with NMFS, of a plan for expedited consideration of MMPA permits \nfor seismic surveying, and development and implementation of a streamlined \npermitting approach for privately-funded seismic data research and collection \naimed at expeditiously determining the offshore energy resource potential of the \nUnited States. As discussed above, it also called for immediate development of a \nnew five-year program with full consideration of leasing in the previously \nexcluded areas. \n65.  On May 3, 2017, several organizations challenged President Trump’s \nExecutive Order revoking the withdrawal of these OCS areas as violating the \nProperty Clause of the U.S. Constitution and as ultra vires in a complaint filed in \nU.S. District Court for the District of Alaska. On March 29, 2019, the district court \nissued a merits decision finding that Section 12(a) of OCSLA did not authorize \nPresident Trump to revoke a prior withdrawal and thereby vacated Section 5 of \nExecutive Order 13795.

Federal Defendants and industry intervenors appealed this decision to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, prior to a decision on the merits, \nPresident Biden issued Executive Order No. 13990 on January 20, 2021. 86 Fed. \nReg. 7037 (Jan. 25, 2021). Among other items, Executive Order 13990 exercised \nPresident Biden’s authority pursuant to Section 12(a) of OCSLA to reinstate \nPresident Obama’s withdrawals. The Executive Order also revoked Executive \nOrder 13785. Based on these developments, the court held that the case was moot. \nLeague of Conservation Voters v. Biden, 843 F. App’x 937, 938 (9th Cir. 2021). \nPursuant to United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950), the Ninth \nCircuit also vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded with \ninstructions to dismiss the case without prejudice. League of Conservation Voters, \n843 F. App’x at 939. \n67.  While this litigation was ongoing, on September 8, 2020, President \nTrump issued a memorandum exercising his authority under Section 12(a) of \nOCSLA to withdraw, for a ten-year period, certain OCS areas in the Eastern and \nCentral Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and Straits of Florida Planning \nAreas. \n68.  On March 13, 2023, President Biden issued a memorandum \nwithdrawing remaining areas of the Beaufort Sea not previously withdrawn from \noil and gas leasing, pursuant to his authority under Section 12(a).

On January 6, 2025, President Biden issued two memoranda \nexercising his authority under Section 12(a) to withdraw OCS areas in the Pacific \nOcean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and small portions of the \nCentral Gulf of Mexico, and the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. See 90 Fed. Reg. \n6739 (Jan. 17, 2025) (Northern Bering Sea withdrawal memorandum); 90 Fed. \nReg. 6743 (Jan. 17, 2025) (Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico withdrawal \nmemorandum).

An accompanying fact sheet noted \nthat President Biden “determined that the environmental and economic risks and \nharms that would result from drilling in these areas outweighed the limited fossil \nfuel resource potential,” and the withdrawals would ensure “that these regions can \nremain healthy and safe from the risk of oil spills resulting from development that \nwould do little, if anything, to meet the nation’s energy needs.” \n70.  That same day, President Trump publicly stated, “It’s ridiculous. I’ll \nunban it immediately.”10 The following day, President Trump publicly stated, “I’m \ngoing to put it back on day one.

On January 17, 2025, a group of plaintiffs led by the State of \nLouisiana and the American Petroleum Institute filed a lawsuit in the Western \nDistrict of Louisiana challenging President Biden’s January 6, 2025 withdrawals. \nLouisiana v. Biden, Civ. No. 2:25-cv-00071 (W.D. La. filed Jan. 17, 2025). In that \nlitigation, industry groups claim “clear and unquestionable” harm because, if not \nfor President Biden’s January 6, 2025 actions, they would be actively exploring \nthose OCS areas and leasing them for oil and gas development. \n72.  On January 20, 2025, the State of Texas and W&T Offshore, Inc., a \nTexas-based oil and natural gas producer, filed a similar lawsuit in the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas. Texas v. Biden, Civ.

OCSLA Section 12(a), 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a), authorizes the President \nto withdraw unleased lands of the Outer Continental Shelf from disposition. \nNeither OCSLA nor any other statute authorizes the President to re-open for \ndisposition areas withdrawn under OCSLA Section 12(a).  \n87.  In reversing President Biden’s Section 12(a) withdrawals, President \nTrump acted in excess of, and wholly without, statutory authority. \n88.  Plaintiffs and their members have no adequate remedy at law and \nabsent relief from this Court will suffer irreparable injury flowing from President \nTrump’s unlawful action. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n1.

This action arises from President Donald Trump’s unlawful attempt to \nundo permanent protections for certain areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf in \nthe Arctic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico,1 put in place \nby President Joe Biden during his term as the 46th president of the United States. \nCiting the principle of responsible public stewardship and the need to protect \nirreplaceable marine and coastal ecosystems, coastal communities, and subsistence \nuses from the harms of oil and gas development and the devastating and \nirreversible consequences of climate change, President Biden withdrew these areas \nfrom future oil and gas leasing pursuant to his authority under Section 12(a) of the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a). Section \n12(a) authorizes presidents to withdraw unleased public lands on the U.S. Outer \nContinental Shelf (“OCS”) from disposition, including through leasing. Neither \nOCSLA nor any other provision of law authorizes Presidents to undo such \nwithdrawals. \n2.  Plaintiffs have long advocated for protecting Outer Continental Shelf \nareas from oil and gas development. On the first day of his presidential term, \n \n1 On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14172 to start a process \nto rename this area as the “Gulf of America.”  90 Fed. Reg. 8629 (Jan. 31, 2025). This \nComplaint refers to this area as the “Gulf of Mexico” in accordance with the name in \neffect at the time all the relevant actions were taken and reflected on all relevant \ndocuments in this case. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

In 2023, President \nBiden added protections for the nearshore Beaufort Sea in Alaska. Finally, on \nJanuary 6, 2025, President Biden issued two memoranda withdrawing areas in the \nPacific, Atlantic, Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, and Northern Bering Sea in \nAlaska, providing protections that had significant local and political support. \n3.  Nevertheless, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14148 entitled “Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and \nActions” that purported to reverse all of the withdrawals made by President \nBiden.2  The Department of the Interior has already taken steps to implement this \nExecutive Order and to promote oil and gas development in these affected areas of \nthe OCS. However, President Trump’s order exceeds his constitutional authority \nand his statutory authority under OCSLA and is therefore ultra vires and unlawful. \nPlaintiffs Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Alaska Wilderness League, \nOceana, Inc., Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Healthy Gulf, Center for \n \n2 With respect to parts of the Arctic Ocean and Atlantic canyons, President Trump’s \nexecutive order revives his 2017 revocation of President Obama’s 2015 and 2016 \nwithdrawals.

He is sued in his official capacity.  \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \n25.  OCSLA governs the leasing, exploration, and development of oil and \ngas deposits in the Outer Continental Shelf. 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq. The OCS \nextends from the outer boundary of state waters, typically three nautical miles from \nshore, to the outer boundary of the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone, 200 \nnautical miles from shore. Id. §§ 1301(a)(2), 1331(a); 48 Fed. Reg. 10605 (Mar. \n14, 1983). The federal OCS consists in total of approximately 2.5 billion acres.  \n26.  OCSLA charges the Secretary of the Interior with managing oil and \ngas activities on the Outer Continental Shelf. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1334(a), 1344(a). \nManagement of the Outer Continental Shelf “shall be conducted in a manner which \nconsiders economic, social, and environmental values of the renewable and \nnonrenewable resources contained in the [OCS],” as well as “the potential impact \nof oil and gas exploration on other resource values of the outer Continental Shelf \nand the marine, coastal, and human environments.”  Id. §§ 1344(a)(1), 1332(3), \n1334(a). OCSLA further directs that offshore development shall be “subject to \nenvironmental safeguards,” consistent with “national needs,” and operations \nshould be conducted so as to “prevent or minimize … damage to the environment.”  \nId. § 1332(3), (6).  \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase CNaos.e 3 3:2:255--ccvv--0000003388--SSLLGG      Documen14t  37     Filed 06/16/25     Page 15 of 46\n\n27.  Under this framework, OCSLA Section 12(a) provides that “[t]he \nPresident of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition \nany of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.”  43 U.S.C. § 1341(a).  \n28.  For areas not so withdrawn and otherwise open to disposition of \nfederal mineral rights, OCSLA establishes distinct stages for oil and gas \ndevelopment activities:  (1) the development of a five-year leasing program, (2) \nissuance of oil and gas leases, (3) approval of lessees’ exploration plans, and (4) \napproval of lessees’ development and production plans. 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.; \n30 C.F.R. Parts 550, 551.  \n29.  Certain exploration activities, such as seismic exploration, can occur \nat any time before or during these stages in accordance with regulations established \npursuant to, inter alia, the Secretary of the Interior’s rulemaking authority. 43 \nU.S.C. §§ 1334(a), 1340(a), (b), (g); see also 30 C.F.R. Parts 550, 551. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nI.  OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF AREAS THREATENED BY \nPRESIDENT TRUMP’S EXECUTIVE ORDER \n30.  President Trump’s Executive Order 14148 purports to reopen several \nareas of the Outer Continental Shelf in the nearshore Beaufort Sea, Atlantic Ocean, \nPacific Ocean, and Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas leasing. \nThese areas had been withdrawn from such activities by President Biden.  \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase CNaos.e 3 3:2:255--ccvv--0000003388--SSLLGG      Documen15t  37     Filed 06/16/25     Page 16 of 46\n\n31.  In Alaska, the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas constitute America’s Arctic \nOcean. With their federal waters still essentially undeveloped, they border \nsensitive federal lands and provide habitat to a rich array of unique wildlife species \nincluding polar bears, walruses, whales, seals, and numerous other mammals, \nbirds, and fish, some of them classified as threatened or endangered. Some of these \nanimals also support thriving indigenous Alaska Native cultural and subsistence \nactivities. Several Arctic mammals, including polar bears and bearded seals, have \nbeen listed under the ESA because of global warming threats to the sea ice on \nwhich they rely for crucial life functions such as foraging and raising young; they \nand numerous other imperiled species are also protected under the MMPA. Many \nArctic species of birds, which migrate to and from the region’s waters annually in \nthe millions, are also threatened by global warming. The region is remote and \nsubject to extreme weather. In winter, the seas are covered in ice and shrouded in \ndarkness. Even in summer, ice can encroach with little notice, and the seas are \nprone to storms and fog. There is little infrastructure in the region to support \nindustrial activity. The coastal region contains only eight small communities, \nunconnected to one another, or the rest of Alaska, by roads. It mostly lacks jet \nrunways, has no deepwater ports, and is hundreds of miles from the nearest Coast \nGuard station.  \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J.

In the Pacific Ocean, federal OCS waters are home to globally \nsignificant marine environments that provide enormous ecological, scientific, and \neconomic benefits. California alone has five National Marine Sanctuaries – \nMonterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Greater Farallones National Marine \nSanctuary, Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, Channel Islands National \nMarine Sanctuary, and the recently-designated Chumash Heritage National Marine \nSanctuary—that are rich in natural and scenic resources and are the basis for some \nof the state’s largest economic drivers. These areas contain an extremely rich and \ndiverse array of marine species, making them ideal places for viewing whales, sea \notters, seals, sea lions, sea turtles, seabirds and other wildlife. Species such as the \ngrey whale span the entire Pacific coast, making an annual migration of more than \n10,000 miles between their wintering and calving areas in Baja California, Mexico \nand their summer feeding grounds in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas in \nAlaska. California’s direct ocean-based economy is nationally significant for \ntourism, marine transport, recreation, and commercial and recreational fisheries. \n33.  Federal OCS waters in the Atlantic Ocean are also home to important \nand sensitive marine species and constitute a marine environment very largely still \nunmarked by industrial development. They contain highly diverse habitats and \nharbor important fish and shellfish populations. The waters of the Atlantic \ncontinental shelf furnish nurseries, feeding grounds, and transit routes for marine \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J.

Among their unique and outstanding geological features are dozens of \nundersea canyons, some of them 100 miles long and deeper than the Grand \nCanyon, rich in marine life. Incised into the continental shelf, these canyons \nsupport cold-water corals hundreds of years old, multitudes of whale species, \nswordfish, bluefin tuna, sea turtles, seabirds, crustaceans, and methane-dependent \norganisms known only from such canyons. The surrounding seafloor and \ncontinental slope break comprise a vast biodiversity hotspot, a mixing zone of \ncurrents and sharp temperature gradients, and underlie an internationally known \nwhale migration corridor that connects feeding grounds in the Gulf of Maine to \ncalving areas offshore Florida. Businesses along the U.S. Atlantic coast— \nincluding fishing, tourism, and recreation industries—are heavily dependent on the \nhealth of this ocean ecosystem and are major contributors to the region’s economy.  \n34.  The Gulf of Mexico is one of the most productive and biodiverse \necosystems in the United States, providing a home to thousands of species ranging \nfrom simple invertebrates to highly evolved marine mammals including dolphins \nand whales. The Gulf includes habitat for five of the world’s seven species of sea \nturtles and is the exclusive home of the critically endangered Rice’s whale, a \nspecies that scientists estimate may have only 50 individuals remaining. Millions \nof people who live in Gulf Coast states depend on this productive marine \nenvironment to support coastal fisheries, tourism, and recreational opportunities. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

Fishing and shrimping are also part of the \ntraditional livelihoods and culture of many Gulf communities. \nII.  THREATS FROM OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND \nDEVELOPMENT \n35.  Oil and gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf has \nsignificant, wide-ranging adverse impacts on these ecosystems and the nearby \ncoastal environments. For example, the deafening sounds generated by pre-lease \nand on-lease seismic surveys and drilling activities disturb and injure marine \nanimals. The heightened risk of oil spills from exploratory and development \ndrilling puts marine life and human activities dependent on it at risk. Vessels, \nfixed-winged aircraft, and helicopters used in oil and gas activities also adversely \naffect ocean species, sometimes fatally. Air and water pollution from oil and gas \noperations and associated infrastructure harm public health and have significant \neffects on tribes and environmental justice communities. \n36.  Plaintiffs are all too familiar with the adverse impacts of OCS oil and \ngas development. The Gulf of Mexico experienced its worst ecological disaster in \nApril 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank, killing eleven \npeople and causing major environmental damage. See generally In re Oil Spill by \nOil Rig “Deepwater Horizon” in Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20, 2010, 21 F. Supp. 3d \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase CNaos.e 3 3:2:255--ccvv--0000003388--SSLLGG      Documen19t  37     Filed 06/16/25     Page 20 of 46\n\n657, 667 (E.D. La. 2014). The Deepwater Horizon explosion caused oil to gush \nfrom the well on the seabed, nearly 5,000 feet below the ocean’s surface for \nmonths until the well finally was capped in mid-July 2010. The result was the \nlargest oil spill in the history of the United States and a cleanup and containment \neffort that at its height enlisted 50,000 workers on land and sea. Over the 87 days \nduring which the well remained uncapped, over 100 million gallons of oil and \nunquantified amounts of natural gas flowed freely into the Gulf. In an effort to \nbreak apart large concentrations of oil, responders released 1 million gallons of \ntoxic dispersants into Gulf waters. The spill contaminated over 112,000 square \nkilometers of ocean waters and over 2,100 kilometers of shoreline in the Gulf.  \n37.  Scientists estimate the spill caused death or serious harm to billions, if \nnot trillions, of animals, including over 100,000 individuals of species listed as \nthreatened or endangered. The Rice’s whale, for example, experienced a 22 percent \npopulation decline as a result of the disaster, and it has not and may not ever \nrecover. The spill marred coastal and bottom habitats, causing severe damage to \nthe ecosystems that support the Gulf’s biodiversity. The harm from the spill to \nmarine and coastal species and the environment persists to this day. In the Atlantic, \na spill equivalent to the Deepwater Horizon disaster could coat beaches stretching \nfrom Savannah to Boston. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase CNaos.e 3 3:2:255--ccvv--0000003388--SSLLGG      Documen20t  37     Filed 06/16/25     Page 21 of 46\n\n38.  Interior has previously found that if just one major lease in the \nArctic’s Chukchi Sea were developed, there would be a 75 percent chance of an oil \nspill of greater than 1,000 barrels in this sensitive region. No response technologies \nreliably result in recovery or containment of even half of the oil from a large \noffshore spill in any region. The three primary oil spill response methods—\nmechanical containment and recovery, in situ burning, and dispersants—would \nlikely be particularly ineffective and damaging in the Arctic. \n39.  Offshore spills have caused similar harms along the Pacific coast. In \nJanuary 1969, the nation’s first large offshore oil spill occurred in the Santa \nBarbara Channel after a blow-out on Platform A in the Dos Cuadras Offshore Oil \nField. Within a ten-day period, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of crude oil \nspilled into the Santa Barbara Channel and onto the beaches of Southern California \nbetween Goleta and Ventura, as well as the shores of the four northern Channel \nIslands. The spill had a significant impact on marine life, killing thousands of sea \nbirds and marine mammals such as dolphins, elephant seals, and sea lions. All \ncommercial fishing was suspended and tourism suffered. Property damage along \nthe shoreline was extensive. The spill was also a factor in the passage of both the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act. The \nspill still ranks as the third largest in U.S. history after the 2010 Deepwater \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J.

More recently, in 2015, as much as 451,000 gallons of crude oil \nspilled from Plains All American Pipeline near Refugio State Beach in Santa \nBarbara County, with at least 21,000 gallons flowing into the Pacific Ocean. \nThousands of birds and marine mammals were killed and 138 square miles of \nfisheries were closed for six weeks. The pipeline was used to transport oil and gas \ndeveloped from California’s OCS.  \n41.  In October 2021, the San Pedro Bay Pipeline (Pipeline P00547) broke \nand spilled crude oil into the waters 4.5 miles offshore of Huntington Beach, \nCalifornia. Failure of the pipeline may have been caused by the anchor of a ship \nthat hooked the pipeline, causing a partial tear. An estimated 24,696 gallons of oil \nwere spilled into San Pedro Bay. The oil spill affected ocean waters, rocky \nintertidal habitats, subtidal habitats, sandy beaches, and sensitive marsh habitats as \nwell as fish, birds, invertebrates, and marine mammals. The spill also closed \nmultiple beaches and harbors, and impacted outdoor recreation and fishing. \n42.  One of the initial impacts that would result from reopening OCS areas \nto oil and gas development would be from the use of seismic airgun surveys. \nSeismic surveying is often conducted two to four years prior to lease sales to \nidentify areas with promising oil and gas prospects, although companies also have \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

As \ntechnology advances, companies frequently conduct surveying in areas already \nsubjected to previous surveying. \n43.  These surveys typically deploy arrays of airguns, which are towed \nbehind ships across broad swaths of the ocean. While seismic surveys are useful \nfor oil and gas prospecting, they have devastating impacts on marine life. Seismic \nairgun arrays fire intense blasts of energy into the water about every 10 to 12 \nseconds for days, weeks, or months at a time depending on the length of the \nsurvey. A large seismic array can produce effective levels of sound—above 250 \ndecibels—greater than that of virtually any other man-made source, save \nexplosives. These noise blasts penetrate deep into the seafloor and rebound to the \nsurface for analysis. \n44.  Noise from seismic operations harms and harasses marine mammals. \nIf animals are exposed to high enough levels of sound, such as those that exist \nclose to some seismic airguns, they can suffer shifts in hearing thresholds and \nhearing loss that may result in mortality. Noise at lower levels also causes many \nmarine mammal species to alter their natural behavior in ways that interfere with \nvital activities, including avoiding feeding areas, diverting their migratory paths, \nseparating mothers and young, and impeding communication among individuals. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase CNaos.e 3 3:2:255--ccvv--0000003388--SSLLGG      Documen23t  37     Filed 06/16/25     Page 24 of 46\n\nIn July 2014, when Interior issued a Record of Decision that opened most federal \nwaters in the Mid- and South Atlantic to seismic oil and gas exploration, it \nestimated that these activities could result in as many as 138,000 injuries and 13.4 \nmillion disturbances of marine mammals, including disruptions in vital behaviors \nsuch as feeding and mating, over the first nine years.  \n45.  Seismic surveys also harm commercially important fish and shellfish. \nThe intense sound pressures produced by industry’s airguns can injure or kill fish \nwith swim bladders or other gas-filled chambers, and the particle motion of the \npowerful sound through the water can damage the hearing and sensory capabilities \nof both fish and invertebrates. At lower intensities, the same sounds can also \nproduce a physical stress response. Over time, this stress response to seismic sound \ncan degrade health and fitness and increase mortality. Seismic airgun disruption to \nfish behavior over large areas of ocean is associated with dramatic reductions in \ndocumented catch rates of commercially important fish. Depression of catch rates \ncan persist well after a seismic survey has ended. \n46.  When the Arctic Ocean was not withdrawn from leasing, the oil \nindustry conducted large-scale seismic surveying there. In the Arctic, these surveys \ncovered tens of thousands of square miles, including in the nearshore Beaufort Sea. \nThe nearshore Beaufort Sea area has high oil and gas resource potential and is \nadjacent to existing state oil and gas activity and infrastructure, including the Trans \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

Before it was \nwithdrawn from leasing, oil companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars in \nseismic surveying, leasing, exploration drilling, and development plans in the area. \nHilcorp is currently producing oil from several leases in this OCS area through its \nNorthstar development, and, before the Ninth Circuit vacated the decision, the \nBureau of Ocean Energy Management approved another oil development, called \nLiberty, in the area. \n47.  Industry continues to be interested in the Beaufort Sea area. The State \nof Alaska’s 2024 Beaufort Sea lease sale, held after the 2024 presidential election \nin nearshore Alaska state waters, was its most successful lease sale since at least \n2018. The Beaufort sale drew 33 bids, including bids competing over the same \ntracts, and it issued 20 leases, at an estimated bonus bid value of over $9 million. \nBids came from multiple companies, including a company new to Alaska that was \nformed initially to explore the Gulf of Mexico “to discover and produce new oil \nand gas fields.”  Several of the leases issued in this recent sale are near the federal \nOCS boundary.    \nIII.

Following President Trump’s April 28, 2017 Executive Order, one \nseismic industry trade group called for seismic surveying to proceed “without \ndelay” in order to “allow for informed decisions as a new five-year lease plan is \ndeveloped.”  In the Atlantic, at least six seismic operation companies applied to \nBOEM for permits to conduct “deep-penetration seismic surveys,” deploying large \nairgun arrays to prospect for oil and gas deposits miles beneath the seafloor. In the \nPacific, at least one company applied to BOEM for a geological and geophysical \npermit to conduct a 3-Dimensional (3D) seismic survey in federal waters offshore \nHuntington Beach, California. Concurrently, several seismic firms applied to the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) for authorization under the MMPA \nto injure and harass marine mammals during their activities.

Although the current five-year program does not expire until 2029, \nPresident Trump, according to press reports, is planning to “quickly reopen five-\nyear drilling plans off the U.S. coast to include more lease sales.”5 This is \nconsistent with President Trump’s campaign promise to “Drill, baby, drill,” and \n“[m]ake America the dominant energy producer in the world, by far!”6 \n56.

PRESIDENTIAL WITHDRAWALS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP’S \nATTEMPTS AT REVERSAL \n59.  There is a long history of presidential withdrawals from oil and gas \nleasing under OCSLA, both permanent and time-limited, dating back to 1960, \nwhen President Eisenhower withdrew areas of the Key Largo Coral Reef Preserve, \nnow part of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Since Eisenhower first \nutilized Section 12(a), Presidents Nixon (through his Secretary of the Interior), \nGeorge H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama, Biden, and even \nPresident Trump have all issued withdrawals. Some of these covered large areas:  \nPresident Clinton’s withdrawals covered 300 million acres, while President \nBiden’s withdrawals covered more than 625 million acres. Presidents have also \nused their withdrawal power in protected areas, such as marine sanctuaries, to \npermanently bar oil and gas leasing. \n \n9 Rachel Frazen, Trump formally establishes new energy council, The Hill (Feb. 14, \n2025), https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5146202-trump-american-energy-\ncouncil-burgum/. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

Until 2017, no president had ever attempted to undo or reverse a prior \nwithdrawal of Outer Continental Shelf areas, other than one with an express end \ndate.  \n61.  On January 27, 2015, President Obama permanently withdrew coastal \nareas in the Arctic’s Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and the Hanna Shoal region in the \nChukchi Sea from oil and gas leasing. The President acted pursuant to the authority \nvested in him by Congress through Section 12(a). The President cited the critical \nimportance of these areas to subsistence use by Alaska Natives as well as for \nmarine mammals, other wildlife, and wildlife habitat. He stated his intention to \nensure that the unique resources of these areas remain available for future \ngenerations. \n62.  On December 9, 2016, as part of his creation of a Northern Bering Sea \nClimate Resilience area, President Obama permanently withdrew areas of the \nNorthern Bering Sea from future oil or gas leasing. The President acted pursuant to \nthe authority vested in him by Congress through Section 12(a), and stated that the \nwithdrawal “furthers the principles of responsible public stewardship entrusted to \nthis office and takes due consideration of the importance of the withdrawn area to \nAlaska Native tribes, wildlife, and wildlife habitat, and the need for regional \nresiliency in the face of climate change.” \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

On December 20, 2016, President Obama permanently withdrew \nadditional portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in Alaska, as well as 26 \nmajor canyons and canyon complexes offshore the Atlantic coast, from future oil \nand gas leasing and any resulting exploration and development. The President \nacted pursuant to the authority vested in him by Congress through Section 12(a), \nagain stating the importance of these ecosystems and their unique resources, and \nwell as the principle of responsible public stewardship.  \n64.  However, following the change in presidential administrations, \nPresident Trump issued an executive order on April 28, 2017, entitled \n“Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.” Exec. Order No. \n13795, 82 Fed. Reg. 20815 (May 3, 2017). Section 4(c) of that order purported to \nrevoke President Obama’s December 9, 2016 withdrawal of areas of the Northern \nBering Sea. Id. at 20816. Section 5 of that order purported to reverse President \nObama’s January 27, 2015, and December 20, 2016, withdrawals in the Atlantic \nand Arctic Oceans. Id. \n65.  On the first business day following President Trump’s issuance of \nExecutive Order 13785, the Secretary of the Interior issued Secretarial Order No. \n3350 to implement it. The secretarial order called for expedited consideration of \nseismic permitting applications for the Atlantic Ocean, establishment, in \ncooperation with NMFS, of a plan for expedited consideration of MMPA permits \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

As discussed above, it also called for immediate development of a \nnew five-year program with full consideration of leasing in the previously \nexcluded areas. \n66.  On May 3, 2017, several organizations challenged President Trump’s \nExecutive Order revoking the withdrawal of these OCS areas as violating the \nProperty Clause of the U.S. Constitution and as ultra vires in a complaint filed in \nU.S. District Court for the District of Alaska. On March 29, 2019, the district court \nissued a merits decision finding that Section 12(a) of OCSLA did not authorize \nPresident Trump to revoke a prior withdrawal and thereby vacated Section 5 of \nExecutive Order 13795.

While this litigation was ongoing, on September 8, 2020, President \nTrump issued a memorandum exercising his authority under Section 12(a) of \nOCSLA to withdraw, for a ten-year period, certain OCS areas in the Eastern and \nCentral Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and Straits of Florida Planning \nAreas. \n69.  On March 13, 2023, President Biden issued a memorandum \nwithdrawing remaining areas of the Beaufort Sea not previously withdrawn from \noil and gas leasing, pursuant to his authority under Section 12(a). President Biden \nstated that such withdrawal was “[c]onsistent with principles of responsible public \nstewardship, and (1) with due consideration of the irreplaceable marine and coastal \nenvironments—including for marine mammals, other wildlife, wildlife habitat, \nscientific research, and Alaska Native subsistence use—of the Beaufort Sea area of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf; (2) independently with due consideration of the \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN.

There is no other source of authority that permits the President to \nreverse or undo a Section 12(a) withdrawal. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. \nCase CNaos.e 3 3:2:255--ccvv--0000003388--SSLLGG      Documen41t  37     Filed 06/16/25     Page 42 of 46\n\n83.  In reversing President Biden’s Section 12(a) withdrawals, President \nTrump acted in excess of his authority under Article II of the U.S. Constitution and \nintruded on Congress’s non-delegated exclusive power under the Property Clause, \nin violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.  \n84.  Plaintiffs and their members have no adequate remedy at law and \nabsent relief from this Court will suffer irreparable injury flowing from President \nTrump’s unlawful action. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(STATUTORY ULTRA VIRES ACTION) \n85.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation set forth in the \nComplaint by reference. \n86.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to redress unlawful official action by \nthe President that exceeds his statutory authority. \n87.  The President lacks authority to reverse or undo Section 12(a) \nwithdrawals. OCSLA Section 12(a), 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a), authorizes the President \nto withdraw unleased lands of the Outer Continental Shelf from disposition. \nNeither OCSLA nor any other statute authorizes the President to re-open for \ndisposition areas withdrawn under OCSLA Section 12(a).  \n88.  In reversing President Biden’s Section 12(a) withdrawals, President \nTrump acted in excess of, and wholly without, statutory authority. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nN. Alaska Env’t Ctr. et al. v.
