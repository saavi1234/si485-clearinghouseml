    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit challenged three executive orders issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, which restricted federal funding for organizations that support transgender rights and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs. On February 20, 2025, nine nonprofits&mdash;San Francisco Aids Foundation, Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Historical Society, Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, Inc., Los Angeles LGBT Center, Prisma Community Care, Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, Baltimore Safe Haven Corp, and Forge, Inc.&mdash;filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs named as defendants President Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Office of Federal Contracts Compliance Programs, the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Archives and Records Administration, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Represented by Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the executive orders violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as exceeded executive authority.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit challenged three executive orders. First, Executive Order 14168, &ldquo;Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government&rdquo; (Jan. 20, 2025), eliminated federal recognition of transgender identities and banned funding for organizations that acknowledge transgender people. Second, Executive Order 14151, &ldquo;Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing&rdquo; (Jan. 20, 2025), ordered the termination of all federal DEIA-related programs, grants, and contracts. Third, Executive Order 14173, &ldquo;Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity&rdquo; (Jan. 21, 2025), barred federal contractors and grant recipients from implementing DEIA policies, with penalties for noncompliance.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs argued these executive orders were in violation of the First Amendment for (1) chilling the plaintiffs&rsquo; speech, (2) imposing an unconstitutional restriction on speech, (3) content and viewpoint discrimination, and (4) impermissibly conditioning funding on the relinquishment of plaintiffs&rsquo; free speech rights. They also argued the orders violated the Fifth Amendment for being impermissibly vague, thereby allowing for discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement and denying people adequate notice as to what speech and activities were prohibited. They also argued the orders violated Equal Protection under the Fifth Amendment, for discrimination on the basis of sex and transgender status. Additionally, they argued the orders were enacted in excess of presidential authority because they usurped the legislative spending power.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs requested a declaration that the executive orders were unlawful, unconstitutional, and invalid. They also sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against the enforcement and implementation of the orders. The case was assigned to Judge Jon S. Tigar.</p>\r\n<p>On March 3, the plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction, asking the court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing all three executive orders while the litigation proceeded. On April 7, the Executive Director of the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Historical Society, the CEO of the Los Angeles LGBT Center, and the CEO of the San Francisco Aids Foundation filed declarations in support of the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, and alleging additional facts about events that had occurred since plaintiffs filed their motion. Specifically, the declarations detailed federal grants previously awarded to plaintiffs that had since been terminated, and the negative impact of the grant terminations on plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On June 9, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in part and denied it in part. 2025 WL 1621636. The court found that the plaintiffs had not alleged a sufficient injury to show standing to challenge many of the provisions in the executive orders, but the court did find that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the Equity Termination Provision, the Gender Termination Provision, and the Gender Promotion Provision (Provisions), each of which concerned the ineligibility of federal funding for certain grants or contracts. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs' claims were contractual in nature and therefore subject to the Tucker Act. The court found that the plaintiffs' claims arose under the Constitution, not a government contract, and therefore the Tucker Act was inapplicable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the merits, the court found that the Gender Termination and Gender Promotion Provisions discriminated on the basis of transgender status, and therefore heightened scrutiny applied under the Fifth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. The court also held that the provisions served no important governmental objectives sufficient to survive heightened scrutiny, and therefore it found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim. The court also found that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the Provisions violated the First Amendment by censoring speech through the withholding of federal funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the court agreed with the plaintiffs that the Equity Termination Provision was likely impermissibly vague under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause, since the term \"equity-related grants or contracts\" failed to provide sufficient notice to grantees as to what speech or activity must be avoided. On the plaintiffs' separation of powers claims, the court found that the Equity Termination Provision violated the separation of powers by terminating grants that the plaintiffs receive under various statutes, and that the Gender Provisions contravened the separation of powers through violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of the ACA and PHSA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court issued a preliminary injunction barring the defendants from enforcing the Provisions against the plaintiffs, and denied the defendants' motion for an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1621636. On June 13, the court entered an order formalizing the upshot of the June 9 opinion. The court ordered the parties to file an updated case schedule by August 27.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2025, the government appealed the district court&rsquo;s order to the Ninth Circuit, again questioning plaintiffs' standing and the merits of their case. The parties submitted a stipulated request to stay the district court proceedings pending the government&rsquo;s appeal. The court granted this request and ordered a stay of district court proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>In the Ninth Circuit, briefing by both the parties and several amici on the issue of the preliminary injunction granted by the distinct court had been completed as of October 14, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

On June 9, the court entered a preliminary injunction to block application of several provisions of those EOs insofar as they had blocked grant funding to the named plaintiffs.",

Immediately after taking office President Donald J. Trump1 (“President Trump”) \n6 \nissued Executive Order No. 14,168, Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and \n7 \nRestoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,650 (Jan. 20, 2025) \n8 \n(“Gender Order”); Executive Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and \n9 \nPreferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“DEI-1 Order”); and Executive Order No. \n10 \n14,173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,633 \n11  (Jan. 21, 2025) (“DEI-2 Order”) (collectively, the “Executive Orders”).2   \n12 \nThe  Executive  Orders  violate  the  fundamental  separation  of  powers  upon  which  the \n13 \nConstitution is based, directly conflict with existing statutes, and violate both the First and Fifth \n14 \nAmendments. The Gender Order is unconstitutional, facially discriminatory, and fundamentally \n15 \nun-American because it decrees that an entire group of people (transgender people) do not exist \n16 \nand makes clear that any organization who states otherwise will be targeted and penalized. \n17 \nDiscriminating against transgender people is not just an effect of the Gender Order—it is its sole \n18 \npurpose. Similarly, the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders unlawfully bar speech that endorses ideas that \n19 \nPresident Trump’s administration (“Trump Administration”) disfavors—including notions of \n20 \ndiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for all. The Executive Orders further provide that \n21 \n22   \n1 Because in this lawsuit Plaintiffs seek only declaratory relief against President Trump, this Motion \n23  does not seek injunctive relief against him.  \n2 As of this filing, the Gender Order has been temporarily enjoined, in part, on a nationwide basis. \n24 \nSee PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-337-BAH, Dkt. No. 61 (D. Md. Feb. 13, 2025) (temporarily \nrestraining defendants “from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the fact that a \n25 \nhealthcare entity or professional provides gender affirming medical care to a patient under the age \nof nineteen under Section 3(g) of [the Gender Order]. . .”). The DEI Orders have been preliminarily \n26 \nenjoined, in part, on a nationwide basis. See Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v. \nTrump, No. 25-cv-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764, at *31-32 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025) (preliminarily \n27 \nenjoining Section 2(b)(i) (the “Termination Provision” of the DEI-1 Order and Sections 3(b)(iv) \n(the “Certification Provision”) and 4(b)(iii) (the “Enforcement Threat Provision”) of the DEI-2 \n28 \nOrder).  \n \n  1   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 11 of 42\n \n1  anyone who engages in speech that does not align with the Trump Administration’s views will have \n2  their federal funding terminated and be subjected to civil investigations and heightened penalties.  \n3  By barring speech that the Trump Administration dislikes, the Executive Orders penalize \n4  certain viewpoints—the greatest First Amendment sin. By weaponizing conditions on federal \n5  funding as an enforcement mechanism, the President attempts to usurp constitutional powers that \n6  are reserved solely for Congress. The Executive Orders also use impermissibly vague phrases that \n7  exacerbate the chilling effect on speech in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In short, the Executive \n8  Orders amount to an extraordinary abuse of power targeting some of this country’s most vulnerable \n9  and marginalized populations.  \n10  Plaintiffs are mission-driven nonprofits that specialize in the delivery of high-quality \n11  healthcare, social, and other critical services to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, \n12  and queer (“LGBTQ”) community; an organization dedicated to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic; \n13  and a historical society whose mission is to preserve the history of the LGBTQ community. The \n14  Executive Orders are designed to silence, defund, dismantle, and otherwise penalize Plaintiffs for \n15  acknowledging the existence of transgender people, advocating for the rights of members of \n16  LGBTQ and other historically marginalized communities, and providing humanitarian services in \n17  an equitable manner.  \n18  The  requested  injunction  is  both  legally  warranted  and  necessary.  Plaintiffs  have  a \n19  reasonable likelihood of prevailing on their claims. The irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and the \n20  communities they serve is severe, intentional, and undeniable. Without an injunction, Plaintiffs will \n21  lose their ability to provide essential, lifesaving services and will be targeted by the government \n22  with penalties that could cripple their organizations. Rates of HIV, AIDS and other communicable \n23  diseases will increase. People served by Plaintiffs will suffer systemic, government-endorsed \n24  discrimination, and lose healthcare, housing, employment, and dignity. For many who rely on \n25  Plaintiffs’ services, this is a matter of life or death. It is in the public interest to save lives by \n26  enjoining these vague, discriminatory, and unconstitutional Executive Orders. \n27 \n28 \n \n  2   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 12 of 42\n \n1  II  STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n2  A.  Plaintiffs Engage in Speech, Advocacy, and Services Advancing the Rights and \nWelfare of Transgender People, and Address Systemic Racism, Sexism, and \n3  Anti-LGBTQ Bias. \n4  Plaintiffs provide necessary services to members of the LGBTQ communities. Speech, \n5  advocacy, and services advancing the civil rights and welfare of transgender and other LGBTQ \n6  people,  and  addressing  systemic  racism,  sexism,  and  anti-LGBTQ  bias,  are  central  to  each \n7  Plaintiff’s mission. All Plaintiffs receive federal funding to support their work. Declaration of Iya \n8  Dammons of Baltimore Safe Haven Corp.

Plaintiffs Have a Shared Purpose and Must Be Able to Continue to Advocate \nfor Those They Serve.  \n22 \n23  Plaintiffs save lives and preserve the history of LGBTQ communities—which is critical \n24  given that the Executive Orders seek to erase the existence of a group of people and disrupt their \n25  access to healthcare and social services. Collectively, Plaintiffs provide services to hundreds of \n26  thousands of people annually. See, e.g., LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶ 3 (500,000 people); NY \n27  LGBT Decl. ¶ 4 (300,000 people); Prisma Decl. ¶ 5 (over 30,000 people); SFAF Decl. ¶ 4 (approx. \n28  27,000 people).  \n \n  5   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 15 of 42\n \n1  To continue their work, Plaintiffs must be able to continue to acknowledge not only the \n2  existence of, but the equal dignity and humanity of the people they serve, including people who are \n3  transgender.  See,  e.g.,  Baltimore  Decl.  ¶  10  (“BSH’s  origin  as  an  organization  created  by \n4  transgender people for transgender people makes it imperative that we not only fight injustices \n5  against transgender people but provide our services to our community in a culturally competent \n6  way.

See, \n22  e.g., FORGE Decl. ¶5 (“[A]ll of our trainings incorporate DEI and DEIA principles because not \n23  only are transgender people an underserved, marginalized group, but transgender people of color, \n24  transgender people living with disabilities, and transgender youth face even greater levels of \n25  victimization and marginalization.”); SFAF ¶¶ 10, 11, 33 (“Targeted services for minority and \n26  transgender communities are essential for effective HIV treatment and . . .

The Executive Orders4  \n2  i.  The Gender Order Seeks to Erase Transgender People.  \n3  The  Gender  Order  expresses  a  disparaging  and  unscientific  view  of  gender  identity, \n4  repudiates the existence of transgender people, deems their identities to be “false,” orders their \n5  exclusion from government recognition and protection, and seeks to coerce others to do the same \n6  by threatening termination of federal funding and other penalties.  \n7  Specifically, the Gender Order states that a person’s sex is an “immutable biological \n8  classification as either male or female” that “does not include the concept of ‘gender identity,’” and \n9  that it is the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female” which “are not \n10  changeable.” “Female” is defined as “a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces \n11  the large reproductive cell.” “Male” is defined as “a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that \n12  produces the small reproductive cell.” Per the Gender Order, “the Executive Branch will enforce \n13  all  sex-protective  laws  to  promote  this  reality”  and  the  above  definitions  shall  govern  the \n14  application of Federal law and administration policy.  \n15  The Gender Order asserts that “gender ideology” “replaces the biological category of sex \n16  with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males \n17  can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to \n18  regard this false claim as true.” Section 3(e) of the Gender Order demands that agencies “take all \n19  necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology,” which is \n20  described as “an internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality. . . .”  \n21  Section 3(g) of the Gender Order prohibits the use of federal funds “to promote gender ideology” \n22  and directs each agency to “assess grant conditions and grantee preferences” to meet this directive.  \n23  The Gender Order does not explain what it means to “promote” gender “ideology.” Section 7 \n24  requires Agencies to report their implementation of the Gender Order within 120 days. The Gender \n25 \n26 \n \n27  4 For the convenience of the Court, the Executive Orders are attached hereto as Exhibits A-C to \nthe Declaration of Jose Abrigo, counsel for Plaintiffs.  \n28 \n \n \n  8   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 18 of 42\n \n1  Order thus penalizes federal grantees, including Plaintiffs, whose speech, trainings, research, and/or \n2  services acknowledge the existence of transgender people and advocate for their equality.  \n3  ii.  The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders Seek to Eliminate Diversity, Equity, \nInclusion, and Accessibility Policies and to Penalize Organizations That \n4  Embrace Such Policies.  \n5  The DEI-1 Order asserts that “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” (“DEIA”) and \n6  related programs are “illegal and immoral discrimination programs,” and, among other things, \n7  directs agencies to terminate all equity-related grants or contracts. The DEI-1 Order expressly \n8  targets private actors, including Plaintiffs. For example, Section 2(b)(ii) directs agencies to provide \n9  the Director of OMB with a “list” of contractors “who have provided DEI training or DEI training \n10  materials to agency or department employees” and grantees “who received Federal funding to \n11  provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or ‘environmental justice’ programs, services, or activities” in the \n12  last four years.  \n13  The DEI-2 Order further asserts the illegality of DEIA and outlines specific mechanisms to \n14  punish federal contractors and grantees that embrace or necessarily rely on principles of DEIA. The \n15  DEI-2 Order directs all executive departments and agencies “to terminate all discriminatory and \n16  illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement \n17  actions, consent orders, and requirements” to “enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to \n18  combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.”  \n19  Similar to the DEI-1 Order, the DEI-2 Order expressly targets private actors, including \n20  Plaintiffs.  Specifically,  Section  3  instructs  agencies  to  cease  promoting  diversity,  requiring \n21  contractors to engage in affirmative action, or encouraging workforce balancing based on race, \n22  color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin. Section 3 further directs agencies to \n23  require grant award recipients to certify that they do not promote DEI and agree that compliance is \n24  material for purposes of the False Claims Act. The DEI-2 Order also directs OMB to excise \n25  references to DEI and DEIA principles from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial \n26  assistance procedures.  Most alarmingly, the DEI-2 Order directs agencies “to advance in the \n27  private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work,” which the DEI-2 Order \n28  asserts is inconsistent with DEI (emphasis added), and directs the Attorney General to submit a \n \n  9   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 19 of 42\n \n1  report  “containing  recommendations  .  .  .  to  encourage  the  private  sector  to  end  illegal \n2  discrimination and preferences, including DEI” (emphasis added). \n \n3  Taken together, the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Executive Orders direct that DEIA policies and \n4  activities are wrong, immoral, fail to comply with federal law, and must cease. Defendants thus \n5  penalize federal grant recipients and contractors, including Plaintiffs, whose speech, trainings, \n6  research, and/or services support or require the consideration of DEIA efforts or traits—namely, \n7  those who seek to assist Black people, women, LGBTQ people, and people living with HIV in \n8  overcoming systemic barriers to equality resulting from past and current discrimination.  \n9  iii.  The  Executive  Orders  Harm  Plaintiffs  by  Chilling  Their  Speech, \nFrustrating Their Core Purposes, and Threatening Penalties.  \n10 \nThe Executive Orders are designed to silence, defund, and otherwise penalize Plaintiffs for \n11 \nacknowledging that transgender people exist and providing them with humanitarian services, which \n12 \nPlaintiffs  cannot  do  without  acknowledging  people’s  diverse  backgrounds  and  experiences, \n13 \nincluding race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, health status, \n14 \nand/or financial status.  \n15 \nThe Executive Orders’ penalties extend beyond loss of funding. The DEI-2 Order invokes \n16 \nthe False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–33, and its harsh treatment of “material” false statements \n17 \nto the government, thereby exposing Plaintiffs to private lawsuits, government prosecution, and \n18 \npenalties of up to three times the amount of the government’s damages. 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729(1), \n19 \n3730. This is especially troubling given that for many Plaintiffs, complying with the terms of their \n20 \nfederal grants and the Executive Orders is impossible, because the grants require action that the \n21 \nExecutive Orders prohibit. See, e.g., LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶ 11, 23 (“Many of the LA \n22 \nLGBT Center’s federally funded grants require the LA LGBT Center to acknowledge, address, and \n23 \ncombat HIV stigma and discrimination...the LA LGBT Center plainly cannot accomplish its \n24 \nmission—and its mandates under existing grants—should the Executive Orders be allowed to \n25 \nstand…”). Of course, these unprecedented liabilities and the risk of funding loss has a chilling \n26 \neffect on Plaintiffs’ free speech.  \n27 \n28 \n \n  10   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 20 of 42\n \n1  Further, the chilling effect that the Executive Orders have on speech is magnified by their \n2  provisions directing officials to create lists of private individuals and organizations suspected of \n3  opposing the Trump Administration’s views. If Plaintiffs are placed on these lists, they will be \n4  further targeted—either directly by government action or indirectly through reputational harms, \n5  and attrition of staff and donors. Moreover, the Executive Orders do not make clear whether such \n6  lists will be made public, which would invite harassment, hostility, or worse.  \n7  E.  The Executive Orders Harm Plaintiffs and Those They Serve.  \n8  The Executive Orders harm each of the Plaintiffs in irreparable ways. For example, SFAF \n9  will not be able to provide, or will have to substantially reduce preventative care, healthcare, and \n10  supportive services to individuals at risk of or living with HIV. SFAF Decl. ¶¶ 10-13, 34-47. GLBT \n11  Historical Society will not be able to preserve and provide public access to LGBTQ history, culture, \n12  and art, which is essential for education, research, collective identity, memory, and advocating for \n13  equal rights. GLBT Decl. ¶¶ 21, 23-24. The LGBTQ Health Centers will be forced to reduce \n14  services, cease core programs, and turn away people who rely on these organizations for low- or \n15  no-cost essential healthcare, including HIV and STI treatment, testing, and prevention, mental \n16  healthcare, and other essential services. See, e.g., Prisma Decl. ¶ 25; SFCHC Decl. ¶¶ 9-12, 15; LA \n17  LGBT (Dr. Duffy) Decl. ¶ 21. LGBTQ Community Centers will be forced to reduce or stop \n18  providing vital humanitarian services, including food and essential goods, housing, homelessness \n19  prevention, HIV and STI testing, mental healthcare, substance use treatment and prevention \n20  counseling, social programs, employment and legal assistance, etc. See, e.g., Baltimore Decl. ¶¶ \n21  10-12, 14; Bradbury Decl. ¶¶ 11-28; LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶¶ 21-23; NY LGBT Decl. ¶¶ \n22  16-27, 31-34. Similarly, FORGE, NY LBGT, and SFCHC will lose the ability to provide care and \n23  prevention services to victims of violent crime, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence. \n24  FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 13, 12; NY LGBT Decl. ¶¶ 27-30; SFCHC Decl. ¶¶ 9-12, 15.  \n25  In short, Plaintiffs cannot advertise, provide services, train staff, train other agencies or \n26  providers,  or  accomplish  their  core  mission  and  mandates  under  existing  grants  while \n27  simultaneously  complying  with  the  Executive  Orders.  See,  e.g.,  Baltimore  Decl.  ¶¶  10-14; \n28  Bradbury Decl. ¶¶ 26-28; FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 21-20; GLBT Decl. ¶¶ 12-13, 24; NY LGBT Decl. ¶¶ \n \n  11   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 21 of 42\n \n1  16-34; LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶ 21; Prisma Decl. ¶ 25; SFAF Decl. ¶¶ 10-13, 34-47; \n2  SFCHC Decl. ¶ 23 (“If the Executive Orders are allowed to stand, SFCHC will face the impossible \n3  choice of abandoning our mission to provide targeted, culturally competent care to marginalized \n4  communities, or forfeit the federal funding supporting many of our lifesaving services.”).  \n5  These are not hypothetical harms. Many Plaintiffs have already received termination/stop \n6  work orders and lost contracts or partnerships as a result of the Executive Orders. See, e.g., \n7  Bradbury Decl. ¶ 27; FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10, 12, Ex. 1; LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶ 16; NY \n8  LGBT Decl. ¶¶ 35-36, Ex. A; SFCHC Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. A-D. FORGE has had to suspend grant \n9  proposals in response to the Executive Orders. FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 16-17. Other Plaintiffs anticipate \n10  that fear stemming from the Executive Orders will result in a loss of staff, donors, patrons, and \n11  patients. See, e.g., Bradbury Decl. ¶ 20; Baltimore Decl. ¶ 15; FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 18-19; LA LGBT \n12  (Dr. Duffy) Decl. ¶¶ 18-21; LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶¶ 16, 21; SFCHC Decl. ¶¶ 18, 21-22. \n13  Moreover,  reducing  or  terminating  Plaintiffs’  services  and  programs  will  have  dire \n14  consequences—consequences that will most heavily burden the LGBTQ community, but will \n15  negatively impact American society as a whole. Instances of communicable diseases like HIV, \n16  Hepatitis, STIs, and MPOX will increase. Baltimore Decl. ¶ 14; LA LGBT (Dr. Duffy) Decl. ¶¶ \n17  18-21; SFAF Decl. ¶¶ 10-13, 34-47; SFCHC Decl. ¶ 25. Unemployment, homelessness, and \n18  substance use will increase.

Street medicine teams and mobile outreach programs will no longer be able to \n23  operate, ceasing work reversing overdoses and providing HIV-related testing and medication to \n24  unhoused people and people engaging in survival sex work, and emergency shelters and transitional \n25  housing will close, further exacerbating the nations’ housing crisis.

U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 505 n.20 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. \n9  Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). Under the “sliding scale” approach to preliminary \n10  injunctions observed in this circuit, “the elements of the preliminary injunction test are balanced, \n11  so that a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of another.” All. for the \n12  Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n13  IV  ARGUMENT  \n14  A.  Plaintiffs Have Standing.  \n15  “To have standing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and \n16  actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant’s challenged behavior; and likely to be \n17  redressed by a favorable ruling.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 766 (2019) (internal \n18  quotation marks omitted). “As a general rule, in an injunctive case this court need not address \n19  standing of each plaintiff if it concludes that one plaintiff has standing.” Nat’l Ass’n of Optometrists \n20  & Opticians LensCrafters, Inc. v. Brown, 567 F.3d 521, 523 (9th Cir. 2009). \n21  First, Plaintiffs must show an injury in fact that constitutes “an invasion of a legally \n22  protected  interest  which  is  (a)  concrete  and  particularized,  and  (b)  actual  or  imminent,  not \n23  conjectural or hypothetical.” Lopez v. Candaele, 630 F.3d 775, 785 (9th Cir. 2010). “Because \n24  constitutional challenges based on the First Amendment present unique standing considerations, \n25  plaintiffs may establish an injury in fact without first suffering a direct injury from the challenged \n26  restriction.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). “In such pre-enforcement cases, the plaintiff \n27  may meet constitutional standing requirements by demonstrating a realistic danger of sustaining a \n28  direct injury as a result of the statute’s operation or enforcement.” Id. (internal quotation marks \n \n  13   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 23 of 42\n \n1  omitted). In pre-enforcement cases, courts consider three related inquiries: (1) whether plaintiffs \n2  have shown a reasonable likelihood that the government will enforce the challenged law against \n3  them; (2) whether the plaintiffs have established that they intend to violate the challenged law; and \n4  (3) whether the challenged law is applicable to the plaintiffs, either by its terms or as interpreted by \n5  the government. See id. at 786. \n6  i.  There  is  a  Reasonable  Likelihood  the  Executive  Orders  Will  Be \nEnforced, as Evidenced by Defendants’ Actions to Date.  \n7 \nThe government’s preliminary efforts to enforce a speech restriction constitute strong \n8 \nevidence that pre-enforcement plaintiffs face a credible threat of adverse government action. Lopez, \n9 \n630 F.3d at 786. Plaintiffs have submitted evidence showing that a substantial portion of their \n10 \nfunding comes from federal contracts and grants.

The \n15 \nExecutive Orders themselves unambiguously express Defendants’ intent to enforce restrictions on \n16 \nfederal contracts and grants. See Gender Order § 3(g); DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(ii), (iii); DEI-2 Order §§ \n17 \n3(b)(iv), 4.  \n18 \nPlaintiffs have received specific notices indicating the Government’s intent to enforce the \n19 \nExecutive Orders in the form of termination notices, stop work orders, etc. See Bradbury Decl. \n20 \n¶¶ 20, 27; FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10, 12, Ex. 1; NY LGBT Decl. ¶¶ 35-36, Ex. A; Prisma Decl. ¶¶ 17-\n21 \n25, Exs. A-B; SFCHC Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. A-D. Given Plaintiffs’ reliance on federal contracts and grants \n22 \nto serve their communities, and the Government’s intent to enforce the Executive Orders against \n23 \nall federal contracts and grants, it is reasonably likely that the Executive Orders will be enforced \n24 \nagainst Plaintiffs.  \n25 \nii.  Plaintiffs Intend to Violate the Executive Orders as Plaintiffs’ Missions \n26  Run Directly Counter to the Executive Orders’ Unlawful Mandates.  \n27  Plaintiffs’  missions  are  fundamentally  implicated  by  the  Executive  Orders.  See,  e.g., \n28  Bradbury Decl. ¶8 (“Executive Orders that restrict or alter the distribution of these funds place \n \n  14   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 24 of 42\n \n1  Bradbury-Sullivan’s operational capacity at significant risk, thereby directly impacting our ability \n2  to fulfill our mission and serve the LGBTQ+ community effectively.”); Baltimore Decl. ¶¶ 10-14 \n3  (“There is simply no way to do our work and fulfill our mission in a way that does not directly \n4  center  the  experiences  of  marginalized  TLGBQIA+  people.”);  FORGE  Decl.  ¶¶  13,  18-20 \n5  (“FORGE plainly cannot accomplish our mission—and our mandates under existing grants—\n6  should the Executive Orders be allowed to stand.”); LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶ 22 (“The \n7  Executive Orders make it difficult, if not impossible, for the LA LGBT Center to continue \n8  providing the same level of social, mental, and physical health care and related social services to \n9  its patients, external partners, and the public.”); NY LGBT Decl. ¶¶30, 34 (“The Executive Order \n10  targeting ‘gender ideology’ presents an existential threat to the NY LGBT Center’s mission, \n11  programs, and the well-being of its clients.”); Prisma Decl. ¶¶ 1, 10, 25 (“Most of our federal \n12  funding explicitly requires us to participate in activities and to employ affirming language that \n13  appear to be considered ‘diversity, equity, inclusion, or accessibility’ efforts according to the \n14  Executive Orders.”); SFAF Decl. ¶ 34 (“These executive orders directly threaten SFAF’s mission. \n15  . . . We cannot afford to stand by as policies attempt to dismantle the very foundation of our work.”); \n16  SFCHC Decl. ¶ 23 (“If the Executive Orders are allowed to stand, SFCHC will face the impossible \n17  choice of abandoning our mission to provide targeted, culturally competent care to marginalized \n18  communities, or forfeit the federal funding supporting many of our lifesaving services. . . .”).   \n19  As detailed in Plaintiffs’ declarations submitted herewith, each of the Plaintiffs intends to \n20  continue the status quo, fulfilling their mission to provide support and services to the LGBT \n21  community and greater population, and necessarily violating the Executive Orders in the process.     \n22  iii.  The Executive Orders Apply to Plaintiffs.  \n23  All Plaintiffs receive federal funding and thus are subject to enforcement of the Executive \n24  Orders. Baltimore Decl. ¶¶ 8-9; Bradbury Decl. ¶ 7; FORGE Decl. ¶ 7; GLBT Decl. ¶ 14; LA \n25  LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11; NY LGBT Decl. ¶¶ 13-15; Prisma Decl. ¶¶ 9-15; SFAF Decl. \n26  ¶¶ 5-9; SFCHC Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.  \n27  In addition to asserting claims on their own behalf, Plaintiffs assert equal protection claims \n28  on behalf of the people they serve, including the LGBTQ individuals who (a) are targeted by the \n \n  15   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 25 of 42\n \n1  Gender Order, (b) will suffer direct injuries because of the intended erasure, and (c) face barriers \n2  to asserting their own claims. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410-11 (1991) (acknowledging third-\n3  party standing to raise the equal protection rights of another); see also City & County. of San \n4  Francisco v. Azar, 411 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (finding that physician plaintiffs \n5  had standing to bring claims on behalf of women seeking abortions and LGBTQ patients). Those \n6  individuals are not only the intended beneficiaries of the programs Congress has funded, but also \n7  at the heart of Plaintiffs’ mission-driven services.  \n8  Finally, the injury threatened arises from, and thus is fairly traceable to, the Executive \n9  Orders and enjoining them would address Plaintiffs’ injuries. Private parties may “sue to enjoin \n10  unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n11  575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015); see also Washington v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-00244-LK, 2025 WL \n12  509617, at *7 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 16, 2025). Enjoining enforcement of the Executive Orders would \n13  redress  the  threat  that  restrictions  on  federal  contracts  and  grants  would  irreparably  impair \n14  Plaintiffs’ ability to promote and apply concepts required by their missions and work. \n15  B.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \n16 \ni.  The Executive Orders  Violate the Free Speech Clause of the First \nAmendment. \n17 \nThe First Amendment provides that the government “shall make no law . . . abridging the \n18 \nfreedom of speech.” U.S. CONST., amend. I. The First Amendment provides robust protection \n19 \nagainst  government  attempts  to  control  the  topics  discussed—and  even  more  so,  the  views \n20 \nexpressed—in public discourse. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015). Accordingly, \n21 \nlaws that restrict speakers from expressing certain viewpoints are a blatant and egregious form of \n22 \ngovernment speech control that is “presumed to be unconstitutional.” Rosenberger v. Rector & \n23 \nVisitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828-29 (1995).  \n24 \nThe  Executive  Orders  impermissibly  chill  the  exercise  of  Plaintiffs’  constitutionally \n25 \nprotected speech based on the content and viewpoint of their speech. The Executive Orders also \n26 \nimproperly penalize Plaintiffs for engaging in First Amendment activity by weaponizing the federal \n27 \nfunding that is necessary for their missions and work, for a public official “may not deny a benefit \n28 \n \n  16   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 26 of 42\n \n1  to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests—especially, his interest \n2  in freedom of speech.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). \n3  The Executive Orders mandate that recipients of federal funds not “promote” “gender \n4  ideology” or “DEI” and related concepts that the Government dislikes. “It is, however, a basic First \n5  Amendment principle that ‘freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what \n6  they must say.’” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 213 (2013) \n7  [hereinafter “AID”] (quoting Rumsfeld v. F. for Acad. & Inst. Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006)); \n8  see also Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Loc. 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 309 (2012) (“The government \n9  may not prohibit the dissemination of ideas that it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement of ideas \n10  that  it  approves.”  (citations  omitted)).  “If  there  is  a  bedrock  principle  underlying  the  First \n11  Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because \n12  society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989) \n13  (collecting cases). The Government’s attempt to do so by way of the Executive Orders is subject to \n14  “the most exacting scrutiny.” Id. at 412.  \n15  Requiring federal grantees to certify that they will not use grant funds to promote concepts \n16  the Government considers offensive, even where the grant program is wholly unrelated to such \n17  concepts, is a violation of the grantee’s free speech rights. See AID, 570 U.S. at 218; see also Santa \n18  Cruz Lesbian & Gay Cmty. Ctr. v. Trump, 508 F. Supp. 3d 521, 528 (N.D. Cal. 2020) [hereinafter \n19  “Santa Cruz”] (requiring federal grantees to certify they will not use grant funds to promote \n20  concepts the Government considers “divisive” violated grantee’s free speech rights). Like the \n21  statute struck down in AID, the Executive Orders demand, as a condition of federal funding, \n22  compliance with a speech restriction that by its nature “cannot be confined within the scope of the \n23  Government program.” See AID, 570 U.S. at 221.  \n24  In a strikingly similar case, Judge Freeman found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed \n25  on the merits of a First Amendment challenge to an executive order passed during President \n26  Trump’s first administration. See Santa Cruz, 508 F. Supp. 3d at 528. There, President Trump \n27  issued an executive order requiring plaintiffs to censor or cease diversity trainings that were \n28  fundamental to their missions on the pain of losing federal funding in the form of contracts and \n \n  17   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 27 of 42\n \n1  grants. See id. at 542 (quoting Exec. Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 60, 686–87). The court found that \n2  “[c]onditioning federal grants in this manner clearly would constitute a content-based restriction \n3  on protected speech.” Id. This was particularly so where the executive order barred any promotion \n4  of “divisive” concepts using federal funds. Id.  \n5  The same logic applies equally to the Executive Orders, which bar Plaintiffs from promoting \n6  “gender ideology,” “DEI,” and/or related concepts on the pain of losing federal grant funding. This \n7  content-based restriction on speech is a flagrant First Amendment violation.  \n8 \nii.  The Executive Orders Violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  \n9 \n10  It is well settled that “‘a basic principle of due process [is] that an enactment is void for \n11  vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.’” Hunt v. City of Los Angeles, 638 F.3d 703, \n12  712 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972)). In this case, \n13  a  stringent  vagueness  test  applies  both  because  the  Executive  Orders  abridge  basic  First \n14  Amendment freedoms and because they invoke heightened penalties, including pursuant to the \n15  False Claims Act. See Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 183 (2018) (“stringent vagueness test” \n16  applies to civil laws that violate the First Amendment or impose penalties similar to those found in \n17  criminal statutes (Gorsuch, J., concurring)); see also Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher \n18  Educ. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764, at *25 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025) (applying \n19  stringent vagueness test and preliminarily enjoining, in part, the DEI Orders).  \n20  Under the terms of the Executive Orders, there is no objective way to determine which \n21  speech activities are permitted and which are prohibited. This creates a broad chilling effect and \n22  invites  unpredictable,  uneven,  and  discriminatory  enforcement  against  recipients  of  federal \n23  funding, including Plaintiffs.  \n24  For example, the Executive Orders do not explain what it means to “promote” so-called \n25  “gender ideology.” Neither do the Executive Orders define the terms “diversity, equity, and \n26  inclusion,” “DEI,” “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” or “DEIA,” despite such terms \n27  being fundamental to the Executive Orders. Similarly, the Executive Orders do not define the term \n28  “equity” when used independently from “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” even \n \n  18   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 28 of 42\n \n1  though Section 2(b) of the DEI-1 Order directs the termination of “equity-related” grants and \n2  contracts, along with other DEI and DEIA activities. Section 3(c) of the DEI-2 Order also uses \n3  impermissibly broad and vague terminology in mandating OMB to “[e]xcise references to DEI and \n4  DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear” from Federal acquisition, contracting, \n5  grants, and financial assistance procedures. Plaintiffs, therefore, are left to speculate what speech \n6  or activity might be considered DEI or DEIA “principles” even without using the actual terms \n7  “DEI” or “DEIA.” See, e.g., SFCHC Decl. ¶ 9; LA LGBT (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶ 19.  \n8  The Executive Orders create additional ambiguity by distinguishing at times between DEIA \n9  that they consider “legal” from that which they consider “illegal.” See DEI-2 Order § 2 (expressing \n10  a policy of terminating all “discriminatory and illegal preferences” and “combat[ting] illegal \n11  private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, program, and activities”); id. § 3(b) (requiring \n12  federal contractors and grantees to certify they do “not operate any programs promoting DEI that \n13  violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination law”). \n14  The language in these provisions regarding illegality begs the question of who determines \n15  what diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility policies, programs, and activities are legal, as \n16  opposed to illegal, and pursuant to what criteria. Given the Trump Administration’s actions already \n17  taken to eliminate DEIA from the federal workplace, it is likely that all DEIA policies, programs, \n18  and activities would be considered illegal by this Administration even without an investigation. \n19  This is especially true because the Executive Orders provide no clear, objective standards for \n20  enforcement, while at the same time specifying a range of serious penalties, including cancellation \n21  of existing contracts and grants, loss of eligibility for future government contracts and grants, and \n22  potential civil investigations, regulatory actions, and/or litigation. In the absence of objective \n23  standards, the Executive Orders give the Trump Administration unfettered discretion to enforce the \n24  prohibitions  against  federal  contractors  and  grantees,  inviting  arbitrary  enforcement  and \n25  discrimination that is subject to the whims of the decisionmaker. See Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity \n26  Officers in Higher Educ., 2025 WL 573764, at *25 (“‘Vague laws invite arbitrary power.’”) \n27  (quoting Sessions, 584 U.S. at 175 (Gorsuch, J., concurring)). Thus, the vagueness of the Executive \n28 \n \n  19   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 29 of 42\n \n1  Orders’ terms exacerbates the preexisting censorship of Plaintiffs’ speech activities by producing \n2  an even greater chilling effect. \n3  The provision of effective and comprehensive housing, healthcare, support, education, and \n4  advocacy services for LGBTQ people and people living with HIV necessarily requires education \n5  and awareness of the historical and ongoing inequities resulting from, among other things, a \n6  person’s race, sex, and/or transgender status, as well as corresponding data collection and attention \n7  to health disparities. See, LA LGBT (Dr. Duffy) Decl. ¶¶ 6-21. Plaintiffs therefore have no way to \n8  discern how to differentiate between the acceptable provision of services in furtherance of their \n9  mission and the unacceptable “operation and promotion of DEI” programs and activities or \n10  unacceptable promotion of “gender ideology.” \n11  Santa Cruz is instructive here as well. There, the court found the plaintiffs were likely to \n12  succeed on the merits of their Fifth Amendment due process challenge regarding President Trump’s \n13  executive order banning the promotion of certain “divisive” concepts. 508 F. Supp. 3d at 543. The \n14  court reasoned that the executive order was likely unconstitutional because it did not provide \n15  sufficient clarity regarding what conduct was prohibited, and therefore posed a danger of arbitrary \n16  and discriminatory application. Id. (citing Hunt, 638 F.3d at 712).  \n17  The same logic applies to the Executive Orders. For example, the Executive Orders are \n18  unacceptably unclear on whether Plaintiffs would be in violation for conducting ordinary activities \n19  like using gender pronouns in their e-mail signature blocks, or celebrating Black or Women’s \n20  History Months, or utilizing widely understood and accepted phrases such as “disadvantaged \n21  communities,” “environmental justice,” “women’s empowerment,” or “gender-based violence,” in \n22  the execution of their work. The Executive Orders are so vague that no ordinary person can \n23  understand what kind of conduct they prohibit. They are therefore unconstitutional.  \n24 \niii.  The  Executive  Orders  Are  Ultra  Vires  Because  They  Exceed  the \n25  President’s Authority, Infringe Upon Congress’s Powers, and Violate \nArticle I’s Framework for Federal Legislation.  \n26 \nThe Executive Orders are ultra vires actions that exceed the bounds of Article II, infringe  \n27 \nupon Congress’s authority to control the public fisc under Article I, and violate Article I’s \n28 \n \n  20   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 30 of 42\n \n1  Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses. “No matter the context, the President’s authority to act \n2  necessarily ‘stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.’” Trump v. \n3  United States, 603 U.S. 593, 607 (2024) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 \n4  U.S. 579, 585 (1952)). Congress authorizes and allocates funds for federal grants in the annual \n5  appropriations bill or by federal statute. Federal grants are federal law, and conditioning or \n6  cancelling federal grants amounts to amending or repealing federal law, which the Executive \n7  Branch has no constitutional or statutory authority to do. See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. \n8  417, 444 (1998) (holding cancellations “are the functional equivalent of partial repeals of Acts of \n9  Congress”); County of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 531 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (“[T]he \n10  President does not have the power to place conditions on federal funds[.]”). That power lies with \n11  Congress. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7; id. art. I, § 8, cl. 1; see also 2 U.S.C. §§ 683, 684 \n12  (Impoundment  Control  Act,  prohibiting  the  President  or  federal  agencies  from  impounding \n13  lawfully appropriated funds). \n14  “The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power over \n15  federal spending.” Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-239 (LLA), 2025 \n16  WL 368852, at *12 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (internal quotation marks omitted); see U.S. CONST. art. \n17  I, § 9, cl. 7. The Appropriations Clause “was intended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority \n18  of the Executive [Branch].” Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937); see \n19  also U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, 130 F. Supp. 3d 53, 76 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Congress’s \n20  power of the purse is the ultimate check on the otherwise unbound power of the Executive.”). \n21  Consistent with these principles, Congress “may impose appropriate conditions on the use \n22  of federal property or privileges.” Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U.S. 444, 461 (1978); see \n23  generally Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595 (2013). “Aside from the power \n24  of veto, the President is without authority to thwart congressional will by cancelling appropriations \n25  passed by Congress.” City & County of San Fransisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1232 (9th Cir. \n26  2018).  \n27  The Executive Orders seek to usurp Congress’s authority by conditioning federal grants on \n28  grantees not promoting “gender ideology” or “DEI.” Gender Order § 3(g); DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(ii)-\n \n  21   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 31 of 42\n \n1  (iii); DEI-2 Order § 3(b)(iv). Such commands attempt to give the President and executive agencies \n2  powers they do not have in blatant disregard for the Constitution and its carefully designed \n3  separation of powers.5 See PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 510050, at *1 (D. \n4  Md. Feb. 14, 2025) (granting TRO against, inter alia, Section 3(g) of the Gender Order in relation \n5  to gender affirming care, finding that the “case presents a straightforward question of separation of \n6  powers”); New York v. Trump, No. 25 Civ. 39, 2025 WL 357368, at *2-3 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025) \n7  (issuing TRO against OMB directive to withhold federal funds); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. \n8  of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25 Civ. 239, 2025 WL 368852, at *14 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  \n9  The Constitution vests Congress, not the Executive, with authority over the public fisc, and \n10  Congress has imposed no conditions on federal grants related to promoting “gender ideology” or \n11  “DEI.” When Congress intends to place conditions on federal funds, “it has proved capable of \n12  saying so explicitly.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1981); see, \n13  e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 526 (2024) (grant condition \n14  regarding the provision of sterile needles); id. § 202 (grant condition regarding salary caps). \n15  The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides grants to family-centered care for \n16  youth in communities disproportionately affected by HIV, exemplifies this incongruity. See 42 \n17  U.S.C. § 300ff; 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-71. Congress placed one condition on these grants: the funds \n18  may not be used to provide “individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes so that such \n19  individuals may use illegal drugs.” 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-1. Congress did not condition such grants on \n20  whether the recipient promotes “gender ideology” or “DEI.” Accordingly, the Executive Orders \n21  force a Presidential policy that is “incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress,” \n22  Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 10 (2015), and unconstitutionally intrudes upon the Congressional \n23  prerogative to control the public fisc. \n24  The Executive Orders not only usurp Congressional powers but also bypass the Legislative \n25  branch altogether to sidestep Article I’s framework for passing laws. “Explicit and unambiguous \n \n26 \n5 The Trump Administration’s actions since the Executive Orders were issued underscore the \nPresident’s intent to disregard the separation of powers upon which our Constitution is based. On \n27 \nFebruary 19, 2025, the White House published, on the platform X, a photo of President Trump \ndressed as a king, with a caption that reads, in part, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” See @WhiteHouse, \n28 \nX (Feb. 19, 2025, 2:31 PM), https://perma.cc/4JFY-9LB4.  \n \n  22   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 32 of 42\n \n1  provisions of the Constitution prescribe and define the respective functions of the Congress and of \n2  the Executive in the legislative process.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 945 (1983). Article I \n3  requires that every bill pass in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before it is \n4  presented to the President. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7, cl. 2. If the President vetoes the bill, Congress \n5  may override his veto by a vote of two thirds of the Senate and the House. Id. art. I, § 7, cl. 3. These \n6  procedural “steps” are non-negotiable: they were designed “to erect enduring checks on each \n7  Branch and to protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by mandating certain \n8  prescribed steps.” Chadha, 462 U.S. at 951, 957.  \n9  “In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are \n10  faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.” Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 587; see \n11  U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3 (the President has an obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \n12  executed”). Rather, as the Supreme Court has unequivocally stated: “[t]he Constitution limits [the \n13  President’s] functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and \n14  the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.” Id. If the President does not wish to disburse funds in the manner \n15  appropriated by Congress, “the President must propose the rescission of funds, and Congress then \n16  may decide whether to approve a rescission bill.” In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. \n17  Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.); see also U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3.  \n18  Article I does not allow the President to circumvent Bicameralism and Presentment by \n19  unilaterally amending or canceling federal appropriations via executive order. See Clinton, 524 \n20  U.S. at 448; Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 38 (1975). “Where Congress has failed to give \n21  the President discretion in allocating funds, the President has no constitutional authority to withhold \n22  such funds and violates his obligation to faithfully execute the laws duly enacted by Congress if he \n23  does so.” County of Santa Clara, 250 F.

Supp. 3d at 531. Congress has not imposed conditions \n7  on federal grants regarding gender ideology or DEI. “The Executive Branch has a duty to align \n8  federal spending and action with the will of the people as expressed through congressional \n9  appropriations, not through ‘Presidential priorities.’” New York, 2025 WL 357368, at *2. Because \n10  the Executive Orders did not abide by the “single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, \n11  procedure” for amending or repealing federal legislation, they are unlawful.

The Executive Orders  Are Ultra Vires Because They Conflict with \nStatutory Equity-Related and Nondiscrimination Requirements.  \n19 \n20  “The Court has the authority to determine whether the Executive Orders are incompatible \n21  with the will of Congress.” PFLAG, 2025 WL 510050, at *18 (citing Loper Bright Enters. v. \n22  Raimondo,  603  U.S.  369,  385  (2024)).  The  Executive  Orders  are  ultra  vires  because  they \n23  impermissibly direct agencies to act in contravention of numerous laws and regulations and are \n24  therefore inconsistent with the Constitution’s separation of powers clause. Federal statutes and \n25  regulations specifically authorize Plaintiffs’ equity-related services and advocacy, and their efforts \n26  to eradicate discrimination against transgender and other LGBTQ people. The President does not \n27  have the power to override those statutes and prohibit grant recipients from doing precisely what \n28  Congress has directed, and what duly promulgated regulations prescribe.  \n \n  24   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 34 of 42\n \n1  The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders conflict with the funding statutes applicable to Plaintiffs who \n2  receive funding through the Ryan White Program and the Housing Opportunities for People with \n3  AIDS (“HOPWA”) program, 24 C.F.R. § 574.300. See, e.g., LA LGBT (Dr. Duffy) Decl. ¶ 5; \n4  Prisma Decl. ¶¶ 9, 13; SFCHC Decl. ¶¶ 7, 23. The Ryan White Program’s statutory framework \n5  explicitly directs resources to disproportionately affected and historically underserved groups and \n6  subpopulations, reflecting Congress’s intent to address healthcare disparities for people living with \n7  HIV/AIDS. 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-12(b)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-52 (mandating grant recipients \n8  to target minority populations); 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-121 (establishing Minority AIDS Initiative to \n9  evaluate and address racial and ethnic disparities in access to HIV care). Likewise, HOPWA \n10  regulations reinforce the prioritization of marginalized populations. See 24 C.F.R. § 574.603 \n11  (affirmative outreach obligations for those at risk of discrimination based on race, national origin, \n12  sex, or disability); 24 C.F.R. § 574.3 (defining “family” in a manner inclusive of LGBTQ+ people). \n13  The statutory framework for Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”), which applies \n14  to Plaintiffs SFCHC and LA LGBT Center, also mandates them to provide medical care to \n15  “medically underserved populations” and specific minority groups facing systemic barriers to \n16  healthcare access. See 42 U.S.C. § 254b(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. § 254b-1 (authorizing states to \n17  determine medically underserved populations eligible for funding). In addition, Congress has \n18  directly appropriated funds for specific minority populations, including grants for Pacific Islander \n19  health services and medical workforce development (42 U.S.C. § 254c-1), as well as funding for \n20  diabetes prevention programs targeted at Native American communities (42 U.S.C. § 254c-3).  \n21  The HOPWA, Ryan White, and FQHC programs are structured to remediate systemic \n22  inequities  in  healthcare  and  housing  and  to  allocate  healthcare  resources  toward  minority \n23  communities affected by health disparities. The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders disregard these statutory \n24  obligations and contradict the express will of Congress by restricting organizations’ ability to \n25  provide services in a manner that complies with the requirements of these programs. \n26  Moreover, the Gender Order facially discriminates based on sex. It directs agencies to \n27  withhold grants from entities that “promote gender ideology,” defined as “acknowledging that a \n28 \n \n  25   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 35 of 42\n \n1  person’s gender identity may differ from their sex assigned at birth.” This violates federal law \n2  prohibiting grant recipients from discriminating on the basis of sex.  \n3  Discrimination based on transgender status, including the failure to acknowledge a patient’s \n4  gender identity, constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex under Section 1557 of the Affordable \n5  Care Act (“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. § 18116, and Section 1908 of the Public Health Service Act \n6  (“PHSA”), 42 U.S.C. § 300w-7. Section 1557 of the ACA provides that an individual shall not, on \n7  the basis of race, national origin, sex, age, or disability “be excluded from participation in, be denied \n8  the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any part of \n9  which is receiving Federal financial assistance.”6 It thus imposes on health entities an “affirmative \n10  obligation not to discriminate in the provision of health care.” Schmitt v. Kaiser Found. Health \n11  Plan of Wash., 965 F.3d 945, 955 (9th Cir. 2020). Section 1908 of the PHSA similarly prohibits \n12  discrimination on the basis of sex in programs, services, and activities “receiving Federal financial \n13  assistance”  through  Preventive  Health  and  Health  Services  Block  Grants,  which  Defendant \n14  Kennedy allots as the Secretary of Defendant HHS. See 42 U.S.C. § 300w-1.  \n15  In Bostock v. Clayton County, a Title VII case, the Supreme Court held that “it is impossible \n16  to discriminate against a person for being . . . transgender without discriminating against that \n17  individual based on sex.” 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020). And because “[w]e construe Title IX’s \n18  protections consistently with those of Title VII,” Doe v. Snyder, 28 F.4th 103, 114 (9th Cir. 2022), \n19  there can be no doubt that “Section 1557 forbids sex discrimination based on transgender status.” \n20  C.P. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ill., No. 3:20-CV-06145-RJB, 2022 WL 17788148, at *6 (W.D. \n21  Wash. Dec. 19, 2022); see also Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, 164 (4th Cir. 2024). The same \n22  reasoning extends to Section 1908 of the PHSA, which is nearly identical in wording to Section \n23  1557 of the ACA. See PFLAG, 2025 WL 510050, at *18. \n24  The Gender Order attempts to override federal statutes with President Trump’s unilateral \n25  declaration that federally funded institutions must repudiate the existence of transgender people. \n26   \n6 Section 1557 further requires that covered entities take reasonable steps to provide meaningful \n27  access to their health programs or activities to individuals with limited English proficiency or with \ndisabilities. See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.201–92.205. Likewise, Section 1557 requires covered entities \n28  to train their employees as necessary and appropriate to carry out their functions consistent with \nthe requirements of Section 1557 and its implementing regulations. See 45 C.F.R. § 92.9. \n \n  26   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 36 of 42\n \n1  See Gender Order §§ 1, 2. The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders attempt to override federal statutes with \n2  President Trump’s unilateral declaration that federally funded institutions must not engage in \n3  efforts that promote “diversity, equity, inclusion, or accessibility.”   \n4  President Trump does not have the power to override Section 1557 of the ACA or Section \n5  1908 of the PHSA by requiring federal grantees to engage in precisely the discrimination that those \n6  laws prohibit. Under these statutes, there is no scenario in which the new discriminatory condition \n7  imposed by the President does not conflict with the non-discrimination mandate set by Congress, \n8  because for entities like Plaintiff Health Centers, it does not matter what specific grants are at issue \n9  or what funding stream is used. When the President usurps congressional authority and infringes \n10  on the constitutional rights of individuals, the essential role of the judiciary is to “say what the law \n11  is.” Loper Bright Enters., 603 U.S. at 385 (summarizing the function of the Judiciary to interpret \n12  statutes dating back to the earliest decisions of the Supreme Court and citing Marbury v. Madison, \n13  5  U.S.  (1  Cranch)  137,  177  (1803); United  States  v.  Dickson,  40  U.S.  (15  Pet.)  141,  162 \n14  (1841); Decatur v. Paulding, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 497, 515 (1840)). The Executive Orders should be \n15  declared unlawful, and the Agency Defendants should be enjoined from enforcing or implementing \n16  these unlawful orders. \n17 \nv.  The Gender Order Violates the Equal Protection Clause.  \n18  The Gender Order flagrantly violates Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection. See U.S. CONST. \n19  amends. V, XIV; United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013) (“The liberty protected by \n20  the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains within it the prohibition against denying to \n21  any person the equal protection of the laws.”). It purposefully discriminates based on transgender \n22  status and it facially classifies based on transgender status and sex, failing any level of review. \n23 \na.  The Gender Order Fails Any Level of Review.  \n24  The Gender Order fails any level of scrutiny because it is transparently motivated by a “bare \n25  desire to harm” transgender people. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996) (citation omitted). \n26  Our Constitution forbids policies based on such “negative attitudes” and “irrational prejudice.” City \n27  of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 448, 450 (1985). The Gender Order facially \n28  discriminates against transgender people by declaring they do not exist and deeming their identities \n \n  27   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 37 of 42\n \n1  to be “false.” Gender Order § 2(f). The Gender Order was issued for the openly discriminatory \n2  purpose of expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people and rendering them unequal \n3  to others. As one court recently put it, “[t]he Court cannot fathom discrimination more direct than \n4  the plain pronouncement of a policy resting on the premise that the group to which the policy is \n5  directed does not exist.” PFLAG, 2025 WL 510050, at *19. \n6  The context surrounding the Gender Order, including other executive actions, betrays its \n7  underlying animus. For example, another executive order issued on January 27, 2025, deems \n8  “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex” to be in conflict with a \n9  “commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.”7 The \n10  Gender Order challenged here is thus part of a far-reaching attack on transgender people who are \n11  expressly targeted in a litany of President Trump’s executive orders.8 The degree of prejudice is \n12  remarkable in its breadth and scope, and reinforces the Gender Order’s unconstitutional purpose. \n13  Disapproving of transgender people and enforcing state-mandated gender conformity is not an \n14  incidental effect of the Gender Order; it is its purpose. It is a status-based classification of persons \n15  undertaken for its own sake, which is forbidden by the Constitution’s Equal Protection guarantee. \n16  Romer, 517 U.S. at 634; see also U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973). There \n17  can be no legitimate government interest in facially discriminatory executive action.  \n18  b.  The Gender Order Triggers Heightened Scrutiny.  \n19  The Gender Order is subject to heightened scrutiny because it facially discriminates against \n20  transgender people and classifies based on sex. The Gender Order defines sex as an “immutable \n21  biological classification” that “does not include the concept of gender identity,” and asserts that \n22  transgender identities are invalid and “false” identities that “[do] not provide a meaningful basis \n23 \n \n24  7 Exec.

If a law “discriminates based on transgender status,  either purposefully or on its face, \n3  heightened scrutiny applies.” Doe v. Horne, 115 F.4th 1083, 1102 (9th Cir. 2024); see also \n4  Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200-01 (9th Cir. 2019). What is more, the Ninth Circuit has \n5  held that “discrimination on the basis of transgender status is a form of sex-based discrimination” \n6  for equal protection purposes. Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1079 (9th Cir. 2024). “It is well-\n7  established that sex-based classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny.” Id. (citing United \n8  States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533-34 (1996)); Virginia, 518 U.S. at 555 (“[A]ll gender-based \n9  classifications . . . warrant heightened scrutiny.”).9  \n10  c.  The Gender Order Fails Heightened Scrutiny.  \n11  “The application of intermediate scrutiny requires the government to show that its gender \n12  classification  is  substantially  related  to  an  important  governmental  interest,  ‘requiring  an \n13  exceedingly persuasive justification.’” Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1104, 1120 (N.D. Cal. \n14  2015) (quoting Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 702 (9th Cir. 1997)). The Gender \n15  Order cannot survive any level of scrutiny, much less heightened scrutiny that must be applied here.  \n16  Disapproving of transgender people, discouraging people from expressing their gender \n17  identities, and directing agencies and federal grantees to do the same are plainly illegitimate \n18  purposes that demonstrate the Gender Order was issued for the purpose of discriminating against \n19  transgender people. Such an objective is not a legitimate state interest. See Horne, 115 F.4th at \n20  1104 (upholding finding of discriminatory purpose where a law’s “burdens [] fall exclusively on \n21  transgender women and girls” and the law was adopted “for the purpose of excluding transgender \n22  girls from playing on sports teams”); Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1077 (same); Dekker, 679 F. Supp. 3d at \n23  1292-93; Van Garderen v. Montana, No. DV-23-541, 2023 WL 6392607, at *14 (Missoula Cnty. \n24  Dist. Ct., Mont. Sept. 27, 2023), aff’d sub nom., Cross v. Montana, 2024 MT 303, 560 P.3d 637 \n25 \n \n9 Here, the Gender Order constitutes a sex classification in myriad ways. First, as noted above, it is \n26 \na sex-based classification because it discriminates based on transgender status. Second, it is a sex-\nbased classification on its face. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660; see also Dekker v. Weida, 679 F. \n27 \nSupp. 3d 1271, 1289-90 (N.D. Fla. 2023) (“If one must know the sex of a person to know whether \nor how a provision applies to the person, the provision draws a line based on sex.”). Third, it \n28 \ndiscriminates based on sex stereotypes. See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1080. \n \n  29   \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM OF \nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 47     Filed 03/03/25     Page 39 of 42\n \n1  (Mont. 2024). \n2  C.  Plaintiffs Are Suffering Irreparable Harm Necessitating Injunctive Relief.  \n3  “Irreparable harm is relatively easy to establish in a First Amendment case.” CTIA—The \n4  Wireless Ass’n v. City of Berkeley, Cal., 928 F.3d 832, 851 (9th Cir. 2019). “[A] party seeking \n5  preliminary injunctive relief in a First Amendment context can establish irreparable injury . . . by \n6  demonstrating the existence of a colorable First Amendment claim.” Id. (cleaned up).  \n7  In addition, Plaintiffs’ declarations provide substantial evidence that the restrictions on \n8  speech imposed by the Executive Orders, in conjunction with the vagueness of those restrictions, \n9  has chilled Plaintiffs’ exercise of their free speech rights. See, e.g., Baltimore Decl. ¶¶ 14-15 (“The \n10  Executive Orders attempt to erase even the word that describes who our people are and interrupt \n11  critical initiatives and services”); Bradbury Decl. ¶ 10 (“This forced adherence to the government’s \n12  prescribed narrative is not only in direct tension with our mission . . . it also makes it impossible \n13  for the Center to conduct its training effectively, as the Center cannot openly and accurately discuss \n14  the systemic issues at the core of LGBTQ+ health disparities.”); FORGE Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10-12, 18-20 \n15  (FORGE had grant-funded content removed from an agency’s website and work paused on updates \n16  to that content; has been told that grant-funded work cannot include certain terms like “equal \n17  opportunity,”  “pronoun,”  and  “accessibility;”  and  is  no  longer  able  to  advertise  or  provide \n18  trainings); LA LGBT  (Hollendoner) Decl. ¶¶  16-18 (“Domestic violence and sexual assault \n19  providers  across  the  country  have  already  begun  removing  information  about  the  LGBTQ \n20  inclusivity of their programs.

Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013) (finding that ongoing harms \n3  to the plaintiffs’ organizational missions as a result of challenged statute established likelihood of \n4  irreparable harm); Santa Cruz, 508 F.

Wolf, 977 F.3d 935, 940-41 \n10  (9th Cir. 2020). As discussed above, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success in proving \n11  violations of their constitutional rights. “[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation \n12  of a party’s constitutional rights.” Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (cleaned \n13  up).  \n14  Moreover, the work Plaintiffs perform is extremely important, even essential, to historically \n15  underserved communities.

I am the Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco AIDS Foundation (“SFAF”), a \n3 nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in San Francisco, California.  SFAF works to promote \n4 health, wellness, and social justice for communities affected by HIV through advocacy, education, \n5 and direct services.  I have served in this capacity since February 14, 2022. \n6 2.  On February 24, 2025, I executed a Declaration (ECF No. 47-9) in support of \n7 Plaintiffs’ Complaint and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, filed on March 3, 2025 (ECF No. \n8 47) to prevent Defendant agencies and their leadership from enforcing Executive Order No. 14168 \n9 “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the \n10 Federal Government” (“Gender Order”), issued January 20, 2025; Executive order No. 14151 \n11 “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing” (“DEI-1 Order”), issued January \n12 20, 2025; and Executive Order No. 14173 “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-\n13 Based Opportunity” (“DEI-2 Order”), issued January 21, 2025 (collectively, the “Executive \n14 Orders”), and related agency directives.  \n15 3.  Since executing that Declaration on February 24, 2025, I learned that Defendant \n16 National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) has terminated a federal grant awarded to the University of \n17 California, San Francisco (“UCSF”) under which SFAF is a subawardee. I have also learned that \n18 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (“SAMHSA”), a component of \n19 Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), recently terminated a grant \n20 to the California Department of Health Care Services under which SFAF is a subrecipient. \n21 4.  I am submitting this supplemental declaration to inform the Court of these recent \n22 developments and the negative impacts they have had and will continue to have on SFAF and the \n23 people that it serves.  \n24 A.  NIH Grant Termination \n25 5.  Upon information and belief, on or about July 18, 2024, UCSF won a $1,628,180 \n26 grant from NIH (the “NIH Grant”) to study the effectiveness of Doxy-PEP, a post-exposure \n27\n2 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF TYLER TERMEER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT \nAND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JTS \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 58     Filed 04/07/25     Page 3 of 6\n \n \n1 prophylaxis  to  prevent  bacterial  sexually  transmitted  infections  (“STIs”)  like  chlamydia, \n2 gonorrhea, and syphilis. The NIH Grant was for the period July 18, 2024 through June 30, 2029 \n3 (the “Doxy-PEP Study”).  \n4 6.  The Notice of Award for the NIH Grant is attached as Exhibit A.  \n5 7.  On July 18, 2024, SFAF was awarded a Cost Reimbursement Subaward by UCSF \n6 under the NIH Grant pursuant to which SFAF is studying the effectiveness of Doxy-PEP in a target \n7 population of transgender women and men who have sex with men (“MSM”). Prior research has \n8 shown that members of this population are at high risk of the bacterial STIs Doxy-PEP is designed \n9 to prevent. \n10 8.  The Cost Reimbursement Subaward Agreement between UCSF and SFAF is \n11 attached as Exhibit B.  SFAF receives approximately $50,000 per year under the NIH Grant. \n12 SFAF’s work in the Doxy-PEP study includes recruiting, enrolling, and maintaining the optimal \n13 study cohort, coordinating with care providers to ensure those enrolled in the study who agree to \n14 take Doxy-PEP continue to do so, and follow-up with those who decline to take Doxy-PEP after \n15 12 months.  SFAF’s work also includes follow-up with those taking Doxy-PEP every three months \n16 to  ensure  completion  of  a  study  questionnaire  and  continued  STI  testing  to  monitor  the \n17 effectiveness of Doxy-PEP and the evaluate bacterial resistance. SFAF has a full-time research \n18 associate working on the Doxy-PEP study and the NIH Grant was intended to fund 25% of that \n19 individual’s compensation in 2025 and 50% of their compensation for the four years thereafter.   \n20 9.  Upon information and belief, on or about March 18, 2025, UCLA received a Notice \n21 of Termination, purporting to immediately terminate the NIH Grant (the “Termination Notice”).  \n22 10.  According to the Termination Notice, the NIH Grant was terminated because \n23 “[r]esearch programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return \n24 on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.  Many such studies \n25 ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities.” \n26 11.  The Termination Notice is attached as Exhibit C.  \n27\n3 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF TYLER TERMEER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT \nAND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JTS \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 58     Filed 04/07/25     Page 4 of 6\n \n \n1 12.  We do not understand the reasoning behind this grant termination. The NIH \n2 Director is directed to “encourage efforts to improve research related to the health of sexual and \n3 gender minority populations.” 42 USC § 283p. Our application and subsequent grant award fall \n4 squarely within this Congressional mandate and the purported basis of this termination directly \n5 contradicts one of the purposes of the NIH. \n6 13.  Without the funding from the NIH Grant, SFAF will likely be forced to terminate \n7 the research associate assigned to the Doxy-PEP study.  \n8 B. The SAMHSA Grant \n9 14.  SFAF receives approximately $125,000 of pass-through funding per year from \n10 SAMHSA.  This funding flows to SFAF from The Center at Sierra Health Foundation, via the \n11 California Department of Health Care Services, and is part of the State of California’s Behavioral \n12 Health Recovery Services Project (the “SAMHSA Grant”).   \n13 15.  The Behavioral Health Recovery Services Project is intended to improve access to \n14 behavioral  health  across  the  state.    The  Center  at  Sierra  Health  Foundation  serves  as  the \n15 administrative entity for the state and awards subrecipient agreements to organizations that provide \n16 behavioral health recovery services to individuals experiencing severe mental illness, serious \n17 emotional disturbance, and substance use disorder. \n18 16.  On April 16, 2024, SFAF was awarded a Subrecipient Agreement by The Center at \n19 Sierra Health Foundation to fund its work enhancing access and equity in substance use treatment \n20 services through strengthening the Treatment on Demand Coalition. SFAF utilized the grant funds \n21 pay for 1.0 FTE dedicated to organizing and working with other behavioral health recovery service \n22 providers  to  expand  substance use  treatment  and  address  racial  disparities  in  overdose  and \n23 treatment outcomes in San Francisco. This work specifically targets communities most impacted \n24 by health disparities, including LGBTQ+, BIPOC, PWID, and TGNB individuals who face \n25 intersecting challenges related to discrimination, homophobia, transphobia, poverty, homelessness, \n26 substance use, mental health issues, and HIV stigma.  \n27\n4 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF TYLER TERMEER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT \nAND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JTS \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 58     Filed 04/07/25     Page 5 of 6\n1 17. The Subrecipient Agreement is attached as Exhibit D.\n2 18. The funds received under the SAMHSA Grant pays one employee’s full-time salary\n3 and, without the funding, that position will need to be eliminated.  \n4 19.  On April 1, 2025, SFAF was advised by The Center at Sierra Health Foundation \n5 that the SAMHSA Grant was terminated effective March 24, 2025.  A copy of the notice SFAF \n6 received is attached as Exhibit E.  \n7 20.  Loss of the SAMHSA Grant would mean that SFAF is no longer able to convene \n8 and coordinate behavioral health recovery service providers to enhance access and equity in \n9 substance use treatment services and would likely have to terminate one full-time employee.    \n10 21.  The NIH Grant and the SAMSHA Grant are not the only federal funding that SFAF \n11 relies upon and experiencing the termination of those grants has only heightened the concerns and \n12 challenges we are already facing as a result of the Executive Orders that were detailed in my \n13 February 24 Declaration. And now, enforcement of the Executive Orders against us is not only \n14 imminent but is clearly already occurring and I am concerned that the NIH and SAMHSA Grants \n15 are just the first of many existing federal grants SFAF receives funding under that will be \n16 terminated. \n17 / \n18 / \n19 / \n20 / \n21 / \n22 / \n23 / \n24 / \n25 / \n26\n27\n5 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF TYLER TERMEER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT \nAND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JTS \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 58     Filed 04/07/25     Page 6 of 6",

I am the Executive Director at the GLBT Historical Society. I have personal\n3 knowledge of the facts stated herein and, if called upon, could competently testify thereto. \n4 2. I submit this declaration to inform the Court of the termination of a grant previously\n5 awarded to GLBT Historical Society by the National Endowment for the Humanities (“NEH”). \n6 3. On August 26, 2024, GLBT Historical Society received approval from NEH for a\n7 grant of $10,000 under Federal Award ID Number PG-300781-24 as part of the American Tapestry \n8 initiative.  \n9 4. The  American  Tapestry  initiative  leverages  the  humanities  to  strengthen\n10 democracy, advance equity, address climate change, and specifically aims to preserve our cultural \n11 inheritance. This initiative emphasizes equity by supporting projects that ensure diverse historical \n12 narratives  are  preserved  and  accessible,  enhancing  public  education  and  understanding  of \n13 historically marginalized communities.1 \n14 5. The  grant  was  specifically  intended  to  support  the  purchase,  shipping,  and\n15 installation of preservation furniture for the storage and preservation of approximately 1,500 rare \n16 and unique LGBTQ archival posters within GLBT Historical Society’s Dr. John P. De Cecco \n17 Archives and Special Collections.  \n18 6. These  posters  represent  critical  visual  and  documentary  evidence  of  LGBTQ\n19 community engagement with the cultural, political, and social dynamics of Northern California. \n20 They  provide  essential  documentation  of  marginalized  queer  communities  whose  historical \n21 contributions and experiences are frequently overlooked or lost. Thus, preserving these materials \n22 directly supports the grant’s objectives to preserve our cultural inheritance and advance equity for \n23 all. \n24\n25\n26\n27 1 https://www.neh.gov/news/american-tapestry-weaving-together-past-present-and-future \n2 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF ROBERTO ORDENANA IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 56     Filed 04/07/25     Page 3 of 5\n1 7. The GLBT Historical Society applied for this grant on January 11, 2024, detailing\n2 the project’s alignment with NEH’s preservation and equity goals. On August 26, 2024, NEH \n3 formally approved the grant. A copy of the Notice of Award is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n4 8. The  preservation  initiative  was  recommended  by  professional  assessments  to\n5 prevent damage from potential environmental risks, thus safeguarding irreplaceable historical \n6 records essential for researchers, scholars, educators, artists, and the broader public. The GLBT \n7 Historical Society uses these archival collections extensively in exhibits, educational programs, \n8 and public outreach, significantly contributing to community awareness and understanding of \n9 LGBTQ history and experiences, consistent with the American Tapestry’s goals of cultural \n10 preservation and advancing equity. \n11 9. Despite initial approval and our reliance on such, on April 2, 2025, NEH terminated\n12 the grant effective immediately. A copy of the termination notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  \n13 10. This termination significantly impacts our capacity to preserve critical historical\n14 materials and undermines our commitment to equitable access to LGBTQ historical narratives, \n15 including crucial elements of transgender history. \n16 11. We still do not understand why the grant was terminated. Our grant application was\n17 clearly within the stated purposes of the American Tapestry initiative. While the termination letter \n18 cites to an executive order that purportedly mandates that the NEH eliminate all non-statutorily \n19 required activities and functions, the law that lead to the creation of the NEH states that, “It is vital \n20 to democracy to honor and preserve its multicultural artistic heritage as well as support new ideas, \n21 and therefore it is essential to provide financial assistance to its artists and the organizations that \n22 support their work.”  A printout of the NEH webpage for the National Foundation on the Arts and \n23 the Humanities Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-209) is attached hereto as Exhibit C.  \n24 12. What is more, the termination letter includes language that is very disconnected\n25 from  the  stated  program  purpose,  including  vague  justifications  such  as  \"new  direction  in \n26 furtherance of the President's agenda,\" \"termination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the \n27\n3 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF ROBERTO ORDENANA IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 56     Filed 04/07/25     Page 4 of 5\n1 federal  government,\"  \"represents  an  urgent  priority,\"  and  references  to  \"exceptional \n2 circumstances.” The language used suggests urgency and a threat to the government’s interests but \n3 provides no meaningful explanation or rationale for why the grant poses such an immediate \n4 concern. \n5 13. Given  the  above,  on  April  4,  2025,  we  reached  out  to  the  NEH  for  further\n6 explanation about the termination; what our ongoing obligations under the grant are, if any; and \n7 how, if at all, we would be able to recoup expenses already incurred in connection with the grant. \n8 On April 7, 2025 we received a response that “no further information is available at this time” and \n9 to “refer to the termination notice from the Acting Chair for information.” A copy of the inquiry \n10 to the NEH is attached hereto as Exhibit D. \n11 14. Regardless of this termination, we intend to continue to apply and compete for NEH\n12 grant funding opportunities that align with and help us fulfill our mission. However, pursuant to \n13 the Gender Order and the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders, the NEH has added guidance to its Notices of \n14 Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) restricting such funding opportunities from the “promotion of \n15 gender  ideology,”  “environmental  justice  initiatives  or  activities,”  “discriminatory  equity \n16 ideology,” and DEI/DEIA. A printout of the NEH webpage titled “NEH Implementation of Recent \n17 Executive Orders,” last updated March 20, 2025, is attached hereto as Exhibit E.   \n18 / \n19 / \n20 / \n21 / \n22 / \n23 / \n24 / \n25 / \n26 / \n27\n4 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF ROBERTO ORDENANA IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 56     Filed 04/07/25     Page 5 of 5",

It enjoins provisions in two Executive Orders that merely\ndirect federal officials to take lawful actions consistent with the President's\npriorities. The district court erred in entering that injunction and this Court\nshould now vacate it.\nThe district court allowed plaintiffs to facially challenge presidential\ndirectives instructing federal agencies to lawfully terminate grants that are\ninconsistent with presidential policy priorities. It did so based entirely on\nplaintiffs' allegations that they have had grant awards terminated, or fear\nawards being terminated in the future. And its injunction directed\ndefendants to reinstate plaintiffs' terminated awards, an order that cannot\nbe reconciled with the Supreme Court's recent decisions in Department of\nEducation U. CalQ'oriiiiz,145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), andNIH U. American Public\nHealth Ass'n,No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669 (U.S. Aug. 21, 2025).\nThe district court's decision was riddled with numerous additional\nerrors. The district court ignored the text of the challenged provisions,\nwhich merely direct federal agencies to carry out their lawful authorities\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 11 of 87\nconsistent with the President's policy priorities, and instead presumed that\nagencies would take unlawful actions in violation of both governing law\nand the Executive Orders themselves. These errors caused the district court\nto conclude that plaintiffs had standing to facially challenge the\npresidential directives themselves, rather than any particular application of\nthem, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits. The same\nerrors infected the court's assessment of the relative harms, causing the\ncourt to downplay the importance of vindicating the President's lawful\ndirectives and to foresee harms that no plausible understanding of the\nExecutive Girders would create.\nSTATEMENT OF ]JURISDICTION\nPlaintiffs invoked the district court's jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331, although plaintiffs' standing is contested. See infra Part I.A. This\nCourt has jurisdiction to review the district court's order granting\nplaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\nThe district court issued that order on June 9, 2025, ER-9-60, and\ndefendants filed their notice of appeal on August 7, 2025, ER-61-62, within\nthe 60-day period for seeking review pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4(a)(1)(B).\n2\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 12 of 87\nSTATEMENTOF THE ISSUES\n1.

The Challenged Executive Orders\nOn January 20, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14,151, 90\nFed. Reg. 8339, entitledEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI\nPrograms and Preferencing (DEI Order), to eliminate \"illegal and immoral\ndiscrimination programs, going by the name 'diversity, equity, and\ninclusion' (DEI)/' in the government. DEI Order § 1. As relevant here, EC)\n14,151 includes a provision that has been referred to as the Equity\nTermination Provision, which directs \"[e]ach agency, department, or\n3\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 13 of 87\ncommission head\" to \"terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by\nlaw, 'equity-related' grants or contracts.\" Id. § 2(b)(i).\nThat same day, the President signed Executive Order No. 14,168, 90\nFed. Reg. 8615,Defending Women Prom Gender Ideology Ex trernisrn dnd\nRestoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government (Gender Ideology Order).\nAs relevant here, that Qrder broadly disapproves of so-called \"gender\nideology,\" which the Qrder describes as the replacement of a biological,\nbinary understanding of sex with \"an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed\ngender identity.\" The Order contains provisions requiring agencies to \"take\nall necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of\ngender ideology,\" id. § 3(e), 90 Fed. Reg. at 8616 (the Gender Termination\nProvision), and to \"assess grant conditions and grantee preferences [to]\nensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology,\" id. § 3(g), Fed. Reg. at\n8616 (the Gender Promotion Provision) .1\n1 Plaintiffs also challenged various provisions in a third Executive\nOrder-Executive Order 14,173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025), entitled\nEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,which\ndirected agencies to \" enforce] our civil-rights law\" by \" ending illegal\npreferences and discrimination.\" Id. § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8633. But the\ndistrict court concluded plaintiffs are not likely to succeed in their\nchallenges to that Order and refused to enjoin any part of it. Plaintiffs have\nnot appealed that denial.\n4\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 14 of 87\nB. Prior Proceedings\n1. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding\nto support their work in providing services to members of the LGBTQ\ncommunity. Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit challenging, as relevant here,\nnumerous provisions of the DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order. Shortly\nafter filing this action, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a preliminary\ninjunction against those provisions.\n2. The district court issued an order granting in part and denying in\npart plaintiffs' motion.\na. The district court began by addressing various threshold\njurisdictional issues. As relevant here, the district court held that plaintiffs\nhad established standing to challenge three provisions of the challenged\nExecutive Qrders -the Equity Termination Provision, the Gender\nTermination Provision, and the Gender Promotion Provision (collectively,\nthe termination provisions).2 It held that plaintiffs have standing to\n2 The district court held that plaintiffs likely do not have standing to\nchallenge provisions directing agencies and the Attorney General to take\nsteps to enforce existing federal antidiscrimination, ER-20-21, and\nprovisions directing OMB and DOJ to review, revise, or terminate internal\ngovernment processes and programs that promote DEI, ER-21-22. It also\nConnived on nextpage.\n5\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 15 of 87\nchallenge those provisions because the provisions direct agencies to\nterminate funding for certain categories of grants or contracts, and because\nplaintiffs alleged that they have lost or will lose funding pursuant to those\nprovisions. ER-23-25. And the court rejected the government's argument\nthat it lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act because, in the district\ncourt's judgment, plaintiffs' challenges to the termination provisions were\nconstitutional in nature, and therefore \"not contractually based.\" ER-27.\nFinally, the district court held that plaintiffs had third-party standing\nto raise equal protection claims on behalf of the transgender clients and\npatients that they serve. The court concluded that plaintiffs suffer their\nown injury in the form of lost funds, have a close relationship with their\ntransgender clients because they provide community and healthcare\nservices, and the transgender patients themselves face barriers to\nvindicating their rights in the form of stigma and discrimination. ER-28-30.\nheld that plaintiffs have standing to challenge a provision that requires\nagencies to include a certification of compliance with federal anti-\ndiscrimination laws, ER-25-26, but held that plaintiffs were not likely to\nsucceed in any of their challenges to that provision and therefore refused to\nenjoin it. ER-39-42, 49-50.\n6\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 16 of 87\nb. Turning to the merits of plaintiffs' facial challenges to the Orders,\nthe district court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on several of\ntheir facial challenges to the three challenged termination provisions.\nThe district court concluded that all three of the challenged\nprovisions likely violate plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. Those\nprovisions, the district court recognized, apply only to activities paid for by\nthe federal government. But even though the government generally has\nbroad latitude to determine which activities to fund, the court nevertheless\nheld that the provisions violate the First Amendment because they further\nno legitimate objectives related to the programs that they burden, and\ninstead simply single out a disfavored group on the basis of the content of\ntheir speech. ER-36-37. The district court also held the provisions likely to\nbe unlawful because they aim to withhold subsidies for a \"censorious\npurpose,\" amounting to the kind of \"invidious viewpoint discrimination\"\nthat, according to the district court, raises First Amendment concerns even\nin the context of federal subsidies. ER-38.\nNext, the district court held that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on\ntheir Fifth Amendment void-for-vagueness challenge, but only as to the\nEquity Termination Provision. The court first concluded that it could apply\n7\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 17 of 87\nvoid-for-vagueness principles to presidential directives that merely\nprovide direction within the Executive Branch rather than regulate any\nprivate conduct. It was enough, the court held, that the Girders \"command\naction\" and that \"various agencies have already taken\" action against\nplaintiffs \"pursuant to\" the Orders. ER-43. The court held that it was not\nsufficiently clear what would qualify as an \"equity-related\" grant or\ncontract, thereby inviting arbitrary enforcement and giving recipients\ninsufficient notice as to what kinds of speech might trigger termination.\nER-44-47. But the district court held that plaintiffs were not likely to\nsucceed on their Fifth Amendment challenge to the Gender Termination\nand Gender Promotion Provisions because the terms in those provisions\nwere defined with enough specificity to satisfy constitutional review.\nFinally, the district court held that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in\nshowing that the Gender Termination and Gender Promotion Provisions\nviolate the equal-protection component of the Due Process Clause. As with\nits standing analysis, the district court accepted that those provisions\nthemselves terminate federal grants on the relevant gender-identity topics.\nThe district court therefore rejected the government's argument that the\nprovisions merely espoused a policy view and did not themselves amount\n8\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 18 of 87\nto a discriminatory action that could be subject to equal-protection review.\nThe court also rejected the argument that the provisions are permissible\ncontent-based funding determinations targeting topics, not any suspect\nclassification. The court concluded that the provisions are facially\ndiscriminatory because they \"sing1[e] out grants that serve transgender\npeople\" and therefore necessarily \"sing1[e] out transgender people\"\nthemselves and \"exclud[e] them\" from the benefit of federal funds. ER-32.\nIn the alternative, the district court held the provisions had an\nimpermissible discriminatory purpose. ER-33. The district court therefore\nconcluded that heightened scrutiny applied and that the provisions failed\nto satisfy heightened scrutiny. ER-33-34.\nC. The district court also ruled in plaintiffs' favor on some of their as-\napplied separation-of-powers and ultra wires claims? The district court\nrejected the government's argument that, because each provision only\nrequires termination to the extent consistent with law, the provisions do\nnot conflict with any statute. The court concluded that those limitations\n3 The district court rejected plaintiffs' facial separation-of-powers\nclaim against the challenged provisions because they failed to establish\nthere were \"no set of circumstances\" under which the challenged\nprovisions would be lawful. ER-50-51.\n9\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 19 of 87\nwere not controlling because the provisions \"unambiguously command\naction\" and the \"savings clause\" cannot \" override\" the provisions' plain\nmeaning. ER-55-56. Turning to the merits of plaintiffs' as-applied claims,\nplaintiffs identified three programs under which they receive funding- the\nRyan White Program, the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS\n(HOPWA) program, and the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC)\nprogram. Plaintiffs did not, however, demonstrate that the government\nhad interpreted the statutes to permit the termination of those grants or\npoint to any agency determination regarding the potential applicability of\nthe Executive Order to those programs. The district court nonetheless\nreviewed the underlying statutory funding authorization for the Ryan\nWhite and FQHC programs in the first instance and concluded that\nmandatory language in those statutes forecloses the federal government\nfrom terminating equity- or gender-related awards under those programs.\nER-52-54. For the HOPWA program, the court concluded that the\ngovernment failed to respond to plaintiffs' argument that the provisions\nconflict with implementing regulations and therefore forfeited any defense\nof that as-applied challenge. ER-53.\n10\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 20 of 87\nFinally, the district court held that the Gender Termination and\nGender Promotion Provisions conflicted with the statutory prohibitions\nagainst sex discrimination contained in the Affordable Care Act and the\nPublic Health Service Act. For the same reasons that the court found that\nplaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal-protection claims, the court\nconcluded that the Gender Termination and Gender Promotion Provisions\namounted to unlawful sex discrimination in contravention of those\nstatutory prohibitions. ER-54.\nd. Turning to the remaining preliminary-injunction factors, the\ndistrict court held that plaintiffs suffered irreparable harm in the form of\ndeprivation of their constitutional rights, and that the government suffered\nno cognizable harm from being prevented from engaging in\nunconstitutional activity. ER-57. The court therefore entered a preliminary\ninjunction preventing the defendant agencies from \" enforcing the Gender\nTermination Provision, Gender Promotion Provision, and Equity\nTermination Provision\" against plaintiffs. ER-58. But the court deferred\nissuing a preliminary-injunction order, instead directing plaintiffs to file a\nproposed order.\n11\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 21 of 87\nPlaintiffs filed a proposed order and the district court signed it the\nsame day. In addition to preventing defendant agencies from enforcing the\nchallenged provisions, the order also directed the agencies to reinstate\nwithin five business days any grant or contract that had been terminated\npursuant to the enjoined provisions, including but not limited to a list of\nspecific grant awards. ER-3-8.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nI.The district court's preliminary injunction was premised on a\nmisunderstanding of the three Executive Order provisions at issue that\ncaused multiple errors relating both to jurisdiction and the merits.\nA. 1. Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of any of their\nclaims because the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider them.\nAs a panel of the Fourth Circuit recognized when considering a nearly\nidentical challenge, plaintiffs' case raises standing and ripeness concerns\nbecause they bring facial challenges to general policy directives contained\nin Executive Qrders rather than any particular agency action implementing\nthose directives. Any prospective injury would thus depend on an\nintervening agency action, which is both speculative and would raise\nissues of the legality of actions that have not yet occurred. If plaintiffs think\n12\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 22 of 87\nany future agency action is unlawful, they must wait until that unlawful\naction comes to pass and then challenge it in an appropriate forum.\n2. The Supreme Court has now twice made clear that the district\ncourt also lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' claims to the extent that\nthey sought relief from terminations of existing grant contracts. As the\nCourt explained, such claims must be brought in the Court of Federal\nClaims, not in district court.\nB. Even if the district court had jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs'\nclaims, none is likely to succeed.\n1. The district court erred in holding that plaintiffs are likely to\nsucceed on the merits of their First Amendment claims. The Supreme Court\nhas made clear that the government is not required to subsidize particular\nprojects or to subsidize on a content- or viewpoint-neutral basis. Rather,\nwhen acting as a patronrather than a regulator,the government can\ngenerally choose what to fund. Regardless, the district court's implicit\nconclusion that it is constitutional to award grants because of their DEI\ncontent but unconstitutional to terminate them for the same reason is a one-\nway constitutional ratchet that finds no purchase in First Amendment\ndoctrine.\n13\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 23 of 87\n2. The district court also erred in holding that plaintiffs are likely\nto succeed in showing that a provision that directs federal agencies, to the\nextent consistent with law, to terminate equity-related grants or contracts is\nlikely void for vagueness. The district court's analysis was driven by its\nerroneous view that private parties were required to assess what was\nmeant by \"equity-related.\" The provision at issue is a directive within the\nExecutive Branch and relates only to contracting decisions over which\nfederal agencies have discretion. Plaintiffs thus have no reason to curtail\ntheir activities to attempt to conform to the definition, and the provision\ngives rise to no vagueness concerns of the sort that would apply if the\ngovernment were regulating primary conduct of private parties.\n3. Plaintiffs lack standing to raise an equal-protection challenge to\nthe gender-ideology provisions on behalf of their clients and patients.\nIndividuals have brought numerous challenges to the provisions at issue\nhere, belying any suggestion that third-party standing is necessary here to\nvindicate the interests of individuals who believe the Gender Ideology\nExecutive Order is discriminatory. Even if they had standing, plaintiffs\nhave not identified any government action, let alone government action\nthat discriminates on any suspect basis. The Supreme Court's recent\n14\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 24 of 87\ndecision inUnited States U. Skrrnetti,145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025), confirms that the\ndistrict court's contrary conclusion cannot stand.\n4. Finally, the district court was not at liberty to disregard the\nplain text of the challenged provisions in assessing plaintiffs' separation-of\npowers claims. The challenged provisions direct agencies to terminate\ngrants only to the extent consistent with law. That is no mere fig leaf or\nsavings clause -it is central to the President's directive.\nII. The district court separately erred by concluding that the\nremaining factors supported granting a preliminary injunction. The\nextraordinary injunction in this case interferes with core executive\nfunctions and prevents the President from directing and controlling\nexecutive officers in their exercise of lawful authority. The enjoined\nprovisions simply guide agencies' exercise of pre-existing authority to\nterminate grants or contracts. By enjoining those directives, the district\ncourt inhibits agencies from exercising their authority in a way that\nfurthers the President's priorities. The injunction thus inflicts irreparable\nconstitutional harm by eroding the President's control over subordinates\nand frustrates the public's interest in having the elected President\n15\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 25 of 87\neffectuate policy priorities through lawful direction of the executive\nbranch.\nAnd as the Supreme Court has twice explained in staying injunctions\nthat similarly ordered the reinstatement of grants, the government\nseparately suffers irreparable harm when it is ordered to pay grant funds\nbecause it is \"unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.\"\nCalifornia,145 S. Ct. at 969. In contrast, the gravamen of plaintiffs' claim is\nmonetary, and plaintiffs will receive any funds they are owed if they\nultimately prevail in an appropriate forum.\nIII. At the very least, the injunction is overbroad to the extent it\norders agencies to reinstate grants and contracts without regard to whether\nthey were terminated pursuant to the challenged Executive Qrders or for\nsome other reason. Neither plaintiffs nor the district court provided any\nbasis why awards that were terminated independent of the challenged\nprovisions should be reinstated pending resolution of this litigation. This\nCourt should at the very least vacate that aspect of the district court's\ninjunction and remand for the district court to determine in the first\ninstance which grants and contracts were, in fact,terminated pursuant to\nthe challenged provisions.\n16\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 26 of 87\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy\"\nthat should \"never be awarded as of right.\" Munufv.

The district court held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge\nthe termination provisions based on allegations that they have lost or fear\nlosing federal funds pursuant to those provisions. The district court placed\nsignificant weight on plaintiffs' allegations that some individual grant\nawards had already been terminated pursuant to those provisions. ER-23-\n25. But it is unclear why an injunction against the future operation of the\nchallenged termination provisions - as opposed to relief related to the\nalready-terminated grant contracts themselves -would redress any injury.\nSee City 0fLos Angeles U. Lyons,461 U.S. 95 (1983). That raises both\nredressability problems and ripeness concerns. And it underscores that\nthere is no basis to consider plaintiffs' abstract challenges to the text of the\nExecutive Orders instead of waiting for a concrete claim raised in the\ncontext of a particular contract termination. Indeed, the district court's\npreliminary injunction tacitly acknowledges this disconnect: It enjoins\ndefendants from enforcing the challenged provisions against plaintiffs, and\nthen separately directs defendants to reinstate various terminated grants.\n\"If one simply flowed from the other, the [d]istrict [c]ourt would have\n19\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 29 of 87\nneeded only\" to enjoin the challenged provisions.

Moreover, as discussed below, plaintiffs' challenge\nto those terminations is precluded by the Tucker Act. See infra pp. 22-26.\nNor can plaintiffs base their standing on the possibility of future\nterminations. As a Fourth Circuit panel recognized in staying a similar\ninjunction against grant-termination provisions, such a request for\nprospective relief presents standing and ripeness problems because\nplaintiffs raise facial challenges against general directives in an Executive\nOrder, rather than any particular funding termination itself.

If plaintiffs contend that the\ntermination of a particular contract in the future is unlawful, they could\nchallenge it in a concrete factual scenario in the appropriate forum. But\nplaintiffs cannot demonstrate Article III standing \"simply by claiming that\nthey experienced a 'chilling effect' that resulted from a governmental\npolicy that does not regulate, constrain, or compel any action on their\npart.\" Clapper,568 U.S. at 419;see Laird U.

That is all\nplaintiffs have challenged here: The provisions merely direct Executive\nBranch officials to terminate certain contracts to the maximum extent\nallowed by law; they do not regulate plaintiffs or their members at all,\nmuch less subject them to threat of enforcement if they engage in particular\nprotected activity. The possibility that a government contract will be\nterminated because the government no longer wishes to fund the kinds of\n21\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 31 of 87\nactivities described in the provisions does not give rise to any cognizable\nchilling effect, unlike the threat of criminal enforcement or other\npunishment for private conduct.\n2. The Tucker Act\nThe Supreme Court also recently made clear, in remarkably similar\ncircumstances, that even if plaintiffs could establish standing to challenge\nthe directives, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider any claims\n\"'based on' [their] research-related grants or to order relief designed to\nenforce any 'obligation to pay money' pursuant to those grants.\" NIH U.\nAmerican Pub. Health Ass'n,No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at*1 (U.S. Aug.\n21, 2025). Rather, any such claims must be pursued under the Tucker Act.\nThe federal government is \"immune from suit in federal court absent\na clear and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.\" Crowley Gou 't\nSerfs., Inc.U. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1105 (DC. Cir. 2022). And although the\nAPA provides \"a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for claims against\nthe United States\" seeking relief other than money damages, id.,that\nwaiver does not apply \"if any other statute that grants consent to suit\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought,\" Match-E-Be-Nasi\nShe-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians U.

California,145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per\ncuriarn), the Supreme Court confronted a challenge brought by a number\nof states to the Department of Education's termination of various\neducation-related grants. The district court temporarily enjoined the\nterminations, and the First Circuit denied a motion to stay that injunction.\nSee California U. LI.S. Dep't 0f Educ.,132 F.4th 92 (1st Cir. 2025). The Supreme\n24\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 34 of 87\nCourt granted the governments request for emergency relief, reaffirming\nthat \"the APA's limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders to\nenforce a contractual obligation to pay money along the lines of what the\nDistrict Court ordered here.\" California,145 S. Ct. at 968 (quotation\nomitted) •\nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed that holding in NIH U. American Public\nHealth Ass'n,No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669 (U.S. Aug. 21, 2025). There, the\nCourt confronted a decision that vacated agency decisions to terminate\nvarious research-related grants. In granting the government's motion for a\nstay of that decision, the Supreme Court again held that the APA does not\nprovide district courts with jurisdiction to consider \"claims 'based on\"' the\nresearch-related grants or to order relief designed to enforce any\n'obligation to pay money' pursuant to those grants.\" NIH,2025 WL\n2415669, at*1. And the controlling opinion specifically rejected the\nargument that authority to review a directive on which the termination\nwas ostensibly based provided jurisdiction to review the termination itself.\nSee id. at*2 (Barrett, J., concurring) .\nThe district court lacked jurisdiction to invalidate plaintiffs' grant\nterminations here for the same reasons. Asin California and NIH,plaintiffs\n25\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 35 of 87\nin this case allege that the government has violated \"a contractual\nobligation to pay money\" assertedly embodied in plaintiffs' grant\nagreements. 145 S. Ct. at 968 (quotation omitted). And as in California and\nNIH,the grants here were awarded by federal executive agencies to specific\ngrantees like plaintiffs from a generalized fund. As a result- and again like\nin California and NIH -the source of plaintiffs' purported rights to payment\nfrom the agencies are not the underlying statutes but rather are plaintiffs'\ngrant agreements, which bear the hallmarks of a contract. Id.\nThe harm that plaintiffs alleged and the relief they sought (and\nreceived) from the district court underscores that this dispute is, at base,\ncontractual. Plaintiffs' concern is the loss of federal funds. To remedy that\nasserted harm, plaintiffs sought, and the district court issued, an order\ncompelling the reinstatement and continued payment of funds under\nparticular grants and contracts.\nB. Plaintiffs' challenges fail on the merits.\nEven if the district court had jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs'\nvarious challenges to the termination provisions, none is likely to succeed.\n26\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 36 of 87\n1. First Amendment\nThe district court erred in holding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed\non the merits of their First Amendment claims. Each of the challenged\nprovisions merely directs agencies, to the maximum extent possible, to\ndeploy preexisting authority to ensure that government funds are not spent\nto support programs and activities that the government no longer believes\nto be in the public interest. The provisions look only to the nature of the\nfunded programs and do not penalize or scrutinize recipients' speech\noutside of the funded initiative. That kind of decision-making about what\nthe government will and will not fund is subject only to deferential review,\nand the district court erred by analogizing to cases where the government\nseeks to use funding conditions to coerce or control a recipients' speech\nmore broadly.\na. The Supreme Court has long been clear that the First Amendment\nprovides the government significant flexibility when it acts as patron to\nsubsidize speech, as opposed to when it acts as sovereign to regulate it. The\n\" decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not\ninfringe the right,\" Regan U. Taxation With Representation of Wasliington, 461\nU.S. 540, 549 (1983), and \" [t]he Government can, without violating the\n27\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 37 of 87\nConstitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it\nbelieves to be in the public interest,\" Rust U. Sullivan,500 U.S. 173, 193\n(1991). The government may permissibly \"cho[ose] to fund one activity to\nthe exclusion of the other,\"id.,and \"may allocate competitive funding\naccording to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of\nspeech or a criminal penalty at stake,\" National Endowrnentfor theArts U.\nFinley,524 U.S. 569, 587-88 (1998).\nThe government can thus, for example, permissibly refrain from\nfunding abortions, Harris U. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 315 (1980), from\nsubsidizing government lobbying, Regan,461 U.S. at 550, and from\nsubsidizing striking employees, Long U. International Union, United Auto.,\nAerospace 8* Air. Implement Workers of Am., 485U.S. 360, 371 (1988), and can\nwithhold funding from political candidates who do not enter party\nprimaries, Buckley U. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 105 (1976) (per curia).\nThe government is no less entitled to cease funding programs that the\ngovernment no longer believes are in the public interest based on the\nsubject matter of those programs. The First Amendment does not require\nfunding grants to research programs that the government believes no\nlonger serve the public interest, any more than funding anti-drug programs\n28\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 38 of 87\nrequires the government to also fund speech advocating for the use of\ndangerous drugs.\nThe district court was thus manifestly mistaken to equate the\ngovernment's refusal to subsidize speech with an effort to censor or to\nsuppress speech. ER-37-39. The district court did not dispute that the\nchallenged provisions look only to the content of the grant-funded\nactivities themselves and do not seek to regulate recipients' speech\ngenerally. ER-35-36. Whenever the government chooses to stop subsidizing\nan activity, there may be less of that activity, but that reduction alone is a\nfar cry from suppression of protected activity. Cf. Long,485 U.S. at 371\n(acknowledging that a constitutionally permissible spending statute\n\"works at least some discrimination\" against the otherwise protected\nactivity) •\nb. Even though the government \"may allocate competitive funding\naccording to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of\nspeech or a criminal penalty at stake,\" Finley,524 U.S. at 587-88, funding\ndecisions are subject to a constitutional constraint insofar as the\ngovernment cannot leverage its funding power to impose an\nunconstitutional condition- such as conditioning grants on refraining from\n29\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 39 of 87\nexpressive conduct \"that [is] separate and independent from the project\nthat receives funds.\" Rust,500 U.S. at 196. The Supreme Court explained\nthis distinction in Finley,and later Supreme Court cases have clarified it.\nThus, the First Amendment precludes the government from using its\nregulatory power to \"drive 'certain ideas or viewpoints from the\nmarketplace/\" and any regulation that \"at[ms] at the suppression of\ndangerous ideas\" is subject to the most stringent First Amendment\nscrutiny. Finley,524 U.S. at 587 (citations omitted). These concerns are not\ngenerally implicated, however, by selective government funding that\nleaves private entities free to express themselves as they wish using their\nown resources. As the Supreme Court explained in Finley,\"cho[osing] to\nfund one activity to the exclusion of the other\" is permissible. Id. at 588\n(citation omitted). Constitutional concerns arise only when Congress is\nusing the funding to affect speech outside of the program. For example,\nwhile limitations on the use of federal funds for a specific purpose - such\nas \"prompt[ing] or advocat[ing] [for] the legalization or practice of\nprostitution or sex trafficking\" - are constitutionally permissible, Agency for\nInt'l Dev. U. Alliance for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc.,570 U.S. 205, 217-18 (2013)\n(quotation omitted), conditioning federal funds on a pledge to adopt a\n30\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 40 of 87\npolicy \"explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking\" is not, id. at\n210 (quotation omitted).\nHere, that means the government can choose to stop funding DEI-\nand gender-ideology-related grants. If the government had refused to\nprovide any funding to entities that engaged in those activities using their\nown funds -assuming those activities constituted protected expression -\nthis case would implicate the constitutional rules that apply when the\ngovernment \"seek[s] to leverage funding\" to limit or penalize \"speech\noutside the contours of the program itself.\" Agency for I11t'l Dev.,570 U.S. at\n214-15. That is a form of coercion that actively suppresses a protected\nprivate activity rather than just refraining from publicly funding it.\nBut nothing remotely like that is present here. \"The Supreme Court\nhas repeatedly reaffirmed that the government may constitutionally\npreclude recipients of federal funds from addressing specified subjects so\nlong as the limitation does not interfere with a recipient's conduct outside\nthe scope of the federally funded program.\" California ex rel. Becerra U. Azan,\n950 F.3d 1067, 1093 n.24 (9th Cir. 2020). The government getting out of the\nbusiness of funding DEI- and gender-ideology-related projects does not\nplausibly \"aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas\" in the sense of\n31\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 41 of 87\ndriving the idea from the marketplace. Finley,524 U.S. at 587. The\ngovernment \"does not 'penalize\"' institutions that choose to do DEI or\ngender-ideology research, \"or deny them the right to\" do that research; it\nhas merely made a constitutionally permissible \" decision not to subsidize\ntheir doing so.\" United States U. American Libs. Ass'li,539 U.S. 194, 212 (2003)\n(plurality opinion) .\nC. The district court rested its contrary conclusion almost entirely on\nits reading of the Supreme Court's decision in Legal Services C0179.U.\nVelazquez,531 U.S. 533, 536 (2001), reading that decision to stand for the\nproposition that, even in the context of funding conditions, the government\ncannot make content- or viewpoint-based distinctions unless doing so\nfurthers specific \"legitimate objectives\" enumerated by Congress. ER-37-38.\nBut as this Court has since explained, Velazquez turned on the Supreme\nCourt's conclusion that the grant program at issue there effectively created\na limited public forum. Legal Aid Serfs.of Or. U. Legal Serve.Corp.,608 F.3d\n1084, (9th Cir. 2010) (\"The [Velazquez] Court analyzed the grantee plaintiffs'\nunconstitutional conditions claim through the lens of the Court's limited\npublic forumcases.\"); see also Mezibov U. Allen,411 F.3d 712, 720 (6th Cir.\n2005) (stating that\" Velazquez involved a government funding program\n32\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 42 of 87\nthat the Court deemed a limited public forum for First Amendment\npurposes\"); Marijuana Policy Project U. United States, 304 F.3d 82, 87 (DC.\nCir. 2002) (stating that Velazquez \"rests on limited public forum doctrine\").\nThe \"limited public forum\" doctrine has no application here. Limited\npublic forum cases recognize that certain funding programs open to all\ncomers must comply with \" [t]he standard of viewpoint neutrality found in\nthe public forum cases.\" Board of Regents of the Univ. of Wis. Sys. U.\nSou thworth,529 U.S. 217, 230 (2000). Those cases draw on the principle that\nwhen the government creates a \"limited public forum,\" open to discussion\nof a particular \"subject matter\" - such as an in-person space for discussion\nor a bulletin board - the government must be \"viewpoint neutral.\" Lamb's\nChapel U. Center Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist.,508 U.S. 384, 389, 393 (1993).\nBut when the government decides to \" selectively fund a program,\" as here,\nit may choose grants that advance its policy goals and reject grants that do\nnot. Finley,524 U.S. at 588 (quotingRust,500 U.S. at 193);accord id. at 590\n(Scalier, J., concurring in the judgment) (evaluating \" grant applications\" on\n\"content- and viewpoint-based criteria\" is \"perfectly constitutional\").\nThe Supreme Court extended this doctrine to certain government\n\"funding decisions\" in Roseriberger U. Rector 8* Visitors of the University of\n33\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 43 of 87\nVirginia,515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995), even though funding programs are\"a\nforum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense,\" id. at\n830. That case involved a public university's funding of a variety of student\ngroups in order to provide \"a wide range of opportunities\" for students. Id.\nat 824 (quotation omitted). The Court emphasized that it addressed a\nsituation in which \"the University expends funds to encourage a\ndiversity of views from private speakers.\" Id. at 834.\nThe Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Finley was a direct\nresponse to an opinion by a divided panel of this Court that applied\nRosenbergefsviewpoint-neutrality requirement to the National Endowment\nof the Arts' selective grant program. Finley U. National Endowment for the\nArts,100 F.3d 671, 688 (9th Cir. 1996) (\"Although NEA awarded only 88\ngrants from an applicant pool of 5,168, it cannot provide those scarce\ngrants to favor a particular viewpoint.\"), rev'd, 524 U.S. 569 (1998). The\ndissenting judge in this Court would have held that \" [w]hether\ngovernment can consider content and viewpoint depends on whether the\nmoney it gives out is generally available to all who meet some basic\nstandard, or whether it is a prize given to a select few.\" Id. at 684 (Kleinfeld,\nJ., dissenting). The Supreme Court held that the Ninth Circuit majority's\n34\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 44 of 87\n\"reliance on Rosenberger [was] misplaced\" for the reason stated in the\nNinth Circuit dissent, notably that the NEA's grant program was\n\"distinguish[ed] from Rosenberger\" because of \"the competitive process\naccording to which the grants are allocated.\" Finley,524 U.S. at 586. Where,\nas in Finley,\"the Government does not indiscriminately 'encourage a\ndiversity of views from private speakers'\" and is not making similarly\n\" objective decisions on allocating public benefits,\" Rosenberger is\ninapplicable. Id. (quoting Rosenberger,515 U.S. at 834). Thus, unless the\nprovision at issue in Finley was \"applied in a manner that raises concern\nabout the suppression of disfavored viewpoints,\" it was constitutional. Id.\nat 587. Such suppression could not be attributed merely to selective\nfunding decisions, whose validity the Court reaffirmed. Id. at 588.\nThrough this series of cases, the Supreme Court has thus clarified\nthat as a general matter, when engaged in selective funding, the\ngovernment need not be agnostic about whether it supports the activity\nbeing funded. Indeed, that principle gave rise to the grants at issue here in\nthe first place: The government explicitly favored means of promoting\nequity in its grantmaking. See, et.,Exec. Order No. 13,985, § 1, 86 Fed. Reg.\n7009, 7009 (Jan. 25, 2021) (\"It is therefore the policy of [the Bider]\n35\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 45 of 87\nAdministration that the Federal Government should pursue a\ncomprehensive approach to advancing equity .\"). Plaintiffs presumably\ndo not believe that this selectivity was unconstitutional when it was\ndeployed to their benefit. The only thing that has changed is that the\ngovernment no longer wishes to fund this particular type of grant, and\nnothing about that change alters the relevant legal principles. Rather, if the\ngovernment was entitled to award grants because it wished to subsidize\nthe grants' viewpoints, there is no constitutional basis to prevent the\ngovernment from terminating them if it no longer wishes to do so (even\nassuming that terminating grants on particular topics is properly treated as\nviewpoint rather than content discrimination) .\n2. Fifth Amendment Void-for-Vagueness\nThe district court also erred in concluding that plaintiffs were likely\nto succeed in challenging the Equity Termination Provision under the Fifth\nAmendment. Treating the President's policy directive as it would a\ncriminal statute, the district court concluded that plaintiffs were likely to\nsucceed in showing the provision is void for vagueness. That holding\nrested on multiple fundamental errors.\n36\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 46 of 87\na. At a basic level, a presidential policy directive to federal officers is\nnot subject to constitutional vagueness standards. Those standards derive\nfrom the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which requires that\nrestrictions on private conduct be sufficiently clear to give a person of\n\" ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is\nprohibited.\" Grained U. City 0f Rockford,408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). The\ndoctrine thus serves to ensure notice and prohibit arbitrary enforcement of\nthe requirements with which the public must comply. Id. But none of these\nconcerns arise if the President gives his subordinates an unclear directive,\nand that is true whether the directive is made in a phone call, a speech, or\nan Executive Order. The Equity Termination Provision is not a law, and it\ndoes not prohibit private conduct- it is instead an instruction that\narticulates the President's policy priorities to subordinate officers in the\nExecutive Branch.\nThe district court cited no case invalidating a directive in an\nExecutive Crder under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. ER-43. Instead, the\ndistrict court concluded that because the challenged Executive Order\nprovisions \"expressly command action\" from agencies, they \"implicate[]\nthe traditional concerns under the vagueness doctrine\" and \"encourage\n37\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 47 of 87\narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\" of the President's directive. ER-\n43. Not SO. The provision commands action only of executive branch\nemployees; it does not direct any action from plaintiffs or otherwise\nregulate any private conduct. Nor does the provision \" encourage arbitrary\nand discriminatory enforcement.\" ER-43. That the President's directive\nleaves room for individual agencies to decide how to implement it does not\ntransform the directive into something akin to a vague criminal\nprohibition. The President is manifestly allowed to direct federal\nemployees to achieve policy goals -even in general or imprecise terms -\nwithout triggering void-for-vagueness concerns.\nThis Court's decision in Humanitarian Law Project U. LI.S. Treasury\nDep't,578 F.3d 1133, 1140, 1145-47 (9th Cir. 2012), is not to the contrary.\nWhile this Court assumed that it could review the Order under the void-\nfor-vagueness doctrine, no party appears to have contested that\nproposition and this Court ultimately concluded that the Executive Qrder\nwas not unconstitutional in any event. Furthermore, the executive action at\nissue in Humanitarian Law Project is distinguishable from the policy\ndirectives at issue here. There, this Court confronted an Executive Order\nfreezing assets of certain terrorist organizations and authorizing the\n38\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 48 of 87\nSecretary of Treasury to designate other groups that provided material\nsupport to those organizations as terrorists themselves. See id. at 1137-38.\nThe Executive Order therefore had direct, substantial consequences both\nfor the designated organizations and for private parties -like the\nplaintiff- that provided support to lawful activities of designated\norganizations. Those facts are a far cry from those presented here, and the\ndecision provides no support for applying vagueness doctrine to policy\ndirectives within the Executive Branch.\nb. Even apart from the intragovernrnental nature of the provision,\nthe Supreme Court has squarely held that there is no constitutional\nguarantee of clarity in grant or contract criteria, even if these criteria are set\nby statute. InNational Endowment for the Arts U. Finley, 524U.S. 569 (1998),\nthe Court rejected a vagueness challenge to the National Foundation on the\nArts and Humanities Act, which provides that grants shall be awarded\naccording to \"artistic excellence and artistic merit , taking into\nconsideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse\nbeliefs and values of the American public,\" 20 U.S.C. § 954(d)(1). The Court\nrecognized that these standards were \"undeniably opaque,\" such that they\n39\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 49 of 87\nwould raise \"substantial vagueness concerns\" in the context of a \"criminal\nstatute or regulatory scheme.\" 524 U.S. at 588.\nIn the context of competitive grants, however, the Court explained\nthat this imprecision raised no such concerns. That is because \"when the\nGovernment is acting as patron rather than as sovereign, the consequences\nof imprecision are not constitutionally severe.\" Finley,524 U.S. at 589. The\nchallenged statute \"merely add[ed] some imprecise considerations to an\nalready subjective selection process,\" and neither these considerations nor\nthe underlying selection process \"irnperrnissibly infringe[d] on First or\nFifth Amendment rights.\" Id. at 590. A contrary conclusion would render\nunconstitutional \"all Government programs awarding scholarships and\ngrants on the basis of subjective criteria such as 'excellence/\" which the\nSupreme Court declined to do. Id. at 589 (citation omitted) .\nThe district court's conclusion that the term \"equity-related\" was\nunconstitutionally vague replicates the analysis that the Supreme Court\nrejected in Finley. Adirective to terminate \" equity-related\" grants creates\nno greater constitutional problem than a directive to terminate grants that\nare not \" excellent\" - and that is so even if, \"as a practical matter,\" putative\n40\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 50 of 87\ngrantees \"may conform to what they believe to be the decisionmaking\ncriteria in order to acquire funding.\" Finley,524 U.S. at 589.\nC. The district court's errors in these respects are particularly\npronounced given the facial nature of plaintiffs' challenge. \"Facial\nchallenges are disfavored for several reasons,\" including that they \"often\nrest on speculation\" and \"consequen[tly] raise the risk of 'premature\ninterpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.'\"\nWashington State Grange U. Washington State Republican Party,552 U.S. 442,\n450 (2008) (quoting Sabri U. United States,541 U.S. 600, 609 (2004)). And\ngiven its scope, \" [f]acia1 invalidation 'is, manifestly, strong medicine' that\n'has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort.\"'\nFinley,524 U.S. at 580 (quotingBroadrick U. Oklahoma,413 U.S. 601, 613\n(1973)).\nAs a general rule, a vagueness claim under the Fifth Amendment\n\"must be examined in light of the facts of the case at hand,\" not on an\nabstract, facial basis. United States U. Moriello,980 F.3d 924 (4th Cir. 2020).\nThat is because \" [o]bjections to vagueness under the Due Process Clause\nrest on the lack of notice, and hence may be overcome in any specific case\nwhere reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk.\"\n41\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 51 of 87\nMaynard U. Cartwright,486 U.S. 356, 361 (1988). Here, plaintiffs' claims\ncannot be examined in light of any relevant facts because they are not\nchallenging any particular grant decision.\nd. Finally, the district court's analysis fundamentally inisunderstands\nthe Equity Termination Provision's role in agency decisionmaking.\nWithout the Executive Order, federal agencies still have discretion to\ndetermine how to exercise their lawful authority to terminate grants or\ncontracts. That authority is often broad and may be exercised based on\npolicy preferences rather than any concrete standard. See, et., 2 C.F.R.\n§ 200.340(a) (4) (authority to terminate award \"to the extent authorized by\nlaw, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency\npriorities\");Northrop Grumman U. United States,46 Fed. Cl. 622, 626 (2000)\n(\"The Government's right to terminate a contract for convenience is\nbroad.\"). That breadth has never been thought to create a vagueness\nproblem, as private parties have no obligation to ascertain, or comply with,\nany standard that might affect the agency's own contracting decisions.\nIt makes no sense that guidance to agencies on how to exercise that\nbroad discretion somehow creates a vagueness problem. As exemplified by\nthe district court's decision here, that approach would allow for searching\n42\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 52 of 87\njudicial review of all presidential policy directives and effectively prohibit\nthe President from directing executive officials unless he can do so with the\nsame degree of specificity required of a criminal statute.\nOf course, to the extent a counterparty believes that a particular\ntermination is unlawful, it could raise that concern in an appropriate\nforum. But no such claim has been brought in this action, which sought\ninstead to preterrnit entirely the review of certain grants. Nor could such a\nclaim be directed at the Equity Termination Provision, which directs\ntermination only as \"allowed by law.\" As the D.C. Circuit has recognized\nin analyzing an analogous Executive Order, a directive to agencies cannot\nbe unlawful when \"the Executive Order itself instructs the agency to follow\nthe law.\" Building 8* Constr. Trades Dep't U. Allbuugh, 295 F.3d 28, 33 (DC.\nCir. 2002).\n3. Fifth Amendment Equal Protection\nFor multiple independent reasons, the district court erred in\nconcluding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their facial\nequal-protection challenge to the gender-ideology provisions.\n43\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 53 of 87\na. First, the district court erred in even considering plaintiffs' Equal\nProtection claim because plaintiffs do not have standing to raise equal-\nprotection challenges on behalf of their clients and patients.\nThe district court concluded that plaintiffs had third-party standing\nto raise equal protection claims on behalf of their transgender clients. But\nas already discussed, supra pp. 17-22, plaintiffs have not established that\nthey have standing to challenge the gender-ideology provisions at all. That\nalone is fatal to any theory of standing based on supposed injuries to their\nclients and patients because \"even when [the Supreme Court] ha[s]\nallowed litigants to assert the interests of others, the litigants themselves\nstill must have suffered an injury in fact.\" PDA U. Alliance for Hippocratic\nMed.,144 S. Ct. 1540, 1563 n.5 (2024) (citation omitted). As the Supreme\nCourt recently reiterated, \" [t]he third-party standing doctrine does not\nallow doctors to shoehorn themselves into Article III standing simply by\nshowing that their patients have suffered injuries or may suffer future\ninjuries.\" Id.; see also Hollingsworth U. Perry,570 U.S. 693, 708-09 (2013).\nEven if plaintiffs could establish that the challenged provisions cause\nthem some injury in fact,they fail to sufficiently assert third-party standing\non behalf of their individual clients. As a general rule, third-party standing\n44\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 54 of 87\nis \"disfavored.\" Fleck 8* Assocs., Inc. U. City 0f Phoenix,471 F.3d 1100, 1105\nn.3 (9th Cir. 2006);see also Mills U. United States, 742 F.3d 400, 407 (9th Cir.\n2014) (\"Courts 'typically decline to hear cases asserting rights properly\nbelonging to third parties rather than the plaintiff.\" (citation omitted)). An\nexception to this rule applies only when the party seeking third-party\nstanding shows that: (1) it has \"a 'close' relationship with the person who\npossesses the right\" and (2) there is \"a 'hindrance' to the possessor's ability\nto protect his own interests.\" Kowalski U. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 130 (2004)\n(citation omitted).\nContrary to the district court's conclusion, plaintiffs failed to carry\ntheir burden to establish third-party standing. Specifically, plaintiffs do\nnot, and cannot, show that their individual clients' ability to protect their\nown interest has been sufficiently hindered to warrant third-party\nstanding. See Tinsley U. Ferguson,47 F.4th 1055, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 2022). To\nthe contrary, individual plaintiffs have already challenged the Gender\nIdeology Executive Order on various grounds, including Equal Protection\ngrounds. See, et., Orr U. Trump,25-cv-10313 (D. Mass. Feb. 7, 2025) (a group\nof individuals filed a putative class action with respect to Executive Qrder\n14,168 asserting Equal Protection claims); Kingdom U. Trump,25-cv-691\n45\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 55 of 87\n(D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) (another putative class action with respect to\nExecutive Order 14,168 pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause); see also\nMoe U. Trump,25-cv-10195 (D. Mass. Jan. 26, 2025); Doe U. MCI-Ienry, III, 25-\ncv-286 (D.D.C. Jan. 30, 2025); PFLAG, Inc. U. Trump,25-cv-337 (D. Md. Feb.\n4, 2025);[ones U. Trump,25-cv-401 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025);Tirrell U. Edelblut,\n24-cv-00251 (D.N.H. Feb. 12, 2025); Ireland U. Hegseth,25-cv-1918 (D.N.J.\nMar. 17, 2025). These pending cases involving similarly situated plaintiffs\nasserting their own claims against the same defendants challenging the\nsame government action undercut the district court's conclusion that\nplaintiffs had demonstrated the kind of \"hindrance\" required to establish\nthird-party standing. See Tinsley,47 F.4th 1069-70 (hindrance not\nestablished where individuals in the same position as clients brought their\nown lawsuits in other states, and where risk of stigma could be redressed\nusing pseudonyms filing) .\nSimply put, this is not a case where potential individual litigants face\n\" daunting\" barriers or have \"little incentive\" to litigate their own claims.\nPowers U. Ohio,499 U.S. 400, 414-15 (1991). As such, plaintiff organizations\nneed not- and therefore cannot-litigate individuals' claims for them.\n46\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 56 of 87\nBecause plaintiffs have failed to identify any discriminatory government\nconduct against themselves and cannot assert third-party standing on\nbehalf of their individual clients, the district court lacked jurisdiction to\nconsider their Equal Protection claim.\nb. Even if plaintiffs had standing to raise an equal-protection\nchallenge to the gender-ideology provisions, any equal-protection\nchallenge is not likely to succeed.\nTo succeed, plaintiffs would have to establish that the Executive\nQrder instructs agencies to take actions that discriminate on the basis of\nsome protected status. But the challenged provisions do not direct agencies\nto do so. Cn their face, the challenged gender-ideology provisions do not\ndraw any distinctions based on sex or any other protected characteristic.\nInstead, the Order expresses a view that sex and gender identity are\ndistinct concepts, and that for a number of reasons it is not workable or\nappropriate to replace sex with gender identity for purposes of identifying\nor sorting people. See Gender Ideology Order § 2(f) (defining \"gender\nideology\"). And the challenged provisions direct agencies to ensure that, to\nthe extent permitted by law, federal money is not being used to fund\nprograms or projects that treat sex and gender identity as interchangeable.\n47\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 57 of 87\nSee id. § 3(e), (g) (directing agencies to ensure government monies are not\nused to fund or promote \"gender ideology\").\nPlaintiffs evidently disagree with that view and would prefer to\ncontinue receiving federal funding for projects that \"replace[] the biological\ncategory of sex with self-assessed gender identity.\" Gender Ideology\nOrder § 2(f). But that does not transform a facially neutral Order into\ndiscriminatory government action that singles out transgender status.\nIndeed, the Order does not even draw a distinction between transgender\nidentity and any other gender identity-it defines \"gender ideology\" to\nmean replacing sex with gender identity generally, and the Qrder notes\nthat the diversity of gender identities is one of the principal reasons why sex\nremains a useful, independent concept.\nThe district court concluded otherwise only by departing entirely\nfrom what the Gender Identity Qrder says and embarking on a series of\nspeculations about what the \"intended consequences\" of the Crder must\nbe. ER-32-33. The district court asserted that the Order facially \"withholds\nfunding based on the transgender status of the individuals that grantees\nserve,II \"preclude[s] providing health and social services that acknowledge\nthe existence of transgender people,\" and requires grantees to \"remove\n48\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 58 of 87\nreferences\" to the existence of transgender people. ER-32. But as noted, the\nOrder says no such thing. By its terms, the Order only requires agencies to\nterminate funding that promotes \" gender ideology,\" which is defined to\nmean replacing sex with self-assessed gender identity, requiring others to\naccept this replacement as true, and thereby diminishing or eliminating\n\"sex as an identifiable or useful category.\" Gender Ideology Order § 3(f).\nNone of that requires grantees to disavow the existence of transgender\npeople or otherwise categorizes people based on their gender identity in\nany way.\nThe Supreme Court's recent decision in United States U. Skrmetti, 145\nS. Ct. 1816 (2025), confirms the district court's error. The Supreme Court\nthere confronted a law that prohibited medical interventions for \"gender\ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence\" in minors. Id.\nat 1829. Like plaintiffs here, the Skrmetti plaintiffs argued that the law\n\" discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status\" and cannot\nwithstand intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 1834. The Supreme Court rejected\nthese arguments and upheld Tennessee's law on rational-basis review.It\nfirst held that Tennessee's law does not classify based on sex because it\n\" does not prohibit conduct for one sex that it permits for the other.\" Id. at\n49\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 59 of 87\n1831. Rather, the prohibition turns on \"the underlying medical concern the\n-et.,\ntreatment is intended to address\" gender dysphoria-and applies\nregardless of a minor's sex.\" Id. at 1830. The same is true here: The\nchallenged provisions direct agencies to terminate funds based not on any\nindividual's sex, but based on whether the program receiving funds\npromotes a view that treats sex and gender identity as interchangeable or\ndiminishes the importance of sex, and that directive applies to all programs\nand does not turn on the sex of any individual or group.\nThe Supreme Court further held in Skrmetti that the law does not\nclassify based on transgender status. 145 S. Ct. at 1834. The Court explained\nthat it \" divides minors into two groups: those who might seek puberty\nblockers or hormones to treat the excluded diagnoses, and those who\nmight seek puberty blockers or hormones to treat other conditions.\" Id. at\n1833. Because \"transgender individuals\" fall into both groups, the Court\nconcluded that \"there is a 'lack of identity' between transgender status and\nthe excluded medical diagnoses.\" Id. The same is true here. Even accepting\nthe district court's assertion that the challenged provision would require\nagencies to strip funding for programs that provide services to people\nexclusively based on their gender identity, transgender people would still\n50\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 60 of 87\nbe able to receive services from programs that impose no such gender-\nidentity based restrictions. In other words, there is a \"lack of identity\nbetween transgender status\" and any line-drawing contained in the\nchallenged provisions because transgender people receive services from\nboth \" groups\" - programs that continue to receive funds and those that do\nnot-created by the Order. The district court's conclusion that the\nchallenged provisions nevertheless discriminate based on transgender\nstatus cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court's decision\nThe absence of any discrimination based on sex defeats plaintiffs'\nclaim, and they cannot revive it based on a generalized critique of the\nsubstance and motivations for the Executive Order. It is black-letter law\nthat only government actioncan violate the Equal Protection Clause. See\nBallot u. McEluait1,29 F.4th 413, 422 (9th Cir. 2022) (\"The central inquiry in\n4 The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari to review this\nCourt's decision in Hecox U. Little, 79 F.4th 1009 (9th Cir. 2023), which\nsubjected a law discriminating against transgender students to heightened\nscrutiny under the Equal Protection clause. If the Supreme Court were to\nhold in that case that transgender status is not a suspect class under equal-\nprotection principles, that would provide yet another basis to vacate the\ndistrict court's decision here. The government respectfully preserves this\nargument for further review while acknowledging that it is foreclosed by\ncircuit precedent for now.\n51\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 61 of 87\nan Equal Protection Clause claim is whether a government action was\nmotivated by a discriminatory purpose.\"). As discussed above, plaintiffs\nfail to identify any action by the government that plausibly violates their\nequal-protection rights; to the contrary, the only actions contemplated are\ntermination of grants that are inconsistent with the Executive Branch's\nfunding priorities that do not discriminate on the basis of sex.\nThat the Executive Order espouses a view of gender identity with\nwhich plaintiffs or the district court disagree does not transform the Order\ninto discriminatory government action. Plaintiffs, for example, complained\nin district court that the Order \"facially discriminates against transgender\npeople by declaring they do not exist and deeming their identities to be\n'false.'\" And the district court similarly concluded that the evident purpose\nof the Qrder is to \"deny the existence of transgender persons entirely.\" ER-\n32-33. Even accepting that interpretation of the Order, but see supra pp.47-\n51, such allegations about government rhetoric are inadequate to make out\nan equal-protection claim. The relevant question is whether the operative\nprovisions of the Executive Order caused some action to be taken on an\nimpermissible ground, and as discussed above, they did not. Absent any\nallegation that any of the Executive Order's provisions direct agencies to\n52\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 62 of 87\nengage in discriminatory actions, the district court had no basis to enjoin or\npolice an Executive Order's language.\n4. As-Applied Separation of Powers\nFinally, the district court erred in considering plaintiffs' claims that\nthe funding termination provisions are inconsistent with several specific\nfunding statutes. The district court held that, if an agency were to terminate\ngrants issued under five statutes, doing so would violate particular\nrequirements of those grant schemes. That holding was error.\na. First, the district court's decision runs headlong into the text of the\nvery provisions that plaintiffs challenge. Each of the challenged provisions\ndirect agencies to terminate funding only to the extent authorized by law.\nSee DEI Order § 2(b)(i), 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (directing agencies to \"terminate,\nto the maximum extent allowed by law, ... 'equity-related' grants or\ncontracts\"), Gender Ideology Order §3(e), 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (directing\nagencies to \"take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the\nFederal funding of gender ideo1ogy\").5 The provisions thus contemplate\n5 Although § 3(g) of the Gender Ideology Order does not expressly\nrestate the qualifier that is explicit in § 3(e) - \"as permitted by law\" - the\ntwo provisions must be read together because they appear in the same\nConnived on nextpage.\n53\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 63 of 87\nthat, in some instances, agencies will not be able to lawfully terminate\ncovered grants. The President's judgment that certain categories of\ncontracts should be terminated to the maximum extent permissible isa\ngeneral policy directive that does not conflict with any statute. And that is\nall that plaintiffs challenge. Qnce again, the decision to target only\ndirectives contained in two Executive Orders, as opposed to any particular\naction taken to implement those Qrders, is fatal to their claim.\nContrary to the district court's conclusion, this Court's decision in\nCity and County of San Francisco U. Trump,897 F.3d 1225 (9th Cir. 2018), does\nnot suggest otherwise. There, this Court confronted an Executive Order\nthat directed that certain agencies \"shall ensure\" that certain jurisdictions\n\"are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for\nlaw enforcement purposes\" by the relevant agency heads. This Court\nconcluded that that directive - for the agencies to \"ensure\" certain\njurisdictions are \"not eligible\" to receive grants except in limited\nsection and address the same subject matter. See United States U. Stewart,311\nU.S. 60, 64 (1940) (\"[A]ll acts in part material are to be taken together, as if\nthey were one law.\"). Moreover, Section 8(b) of the Order specifically\nprovides that that the Executive Order in full must be \"implemented\nconsistent with applicable law.\"\n54\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 64 of 87\ncircumstances -was sufficiently \"clear and specific\" that it could not be\n\" overridden\" by language indicating that the agencies should carry it out\n\"in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law.\" Id. at 1239.\nBy contrast, here, the challenged provisions do not unequivocally\ncompel agencies to improperly withhold congressionally appropriated\nfunds. Instead, the Executive Orders direct agencies to align government\nfunding with policy priorities while explicitly directing them to yield to\nany and all applicable laws before terminating any funding. In that way,\nthis case is analogous to the Executive Order the DC. Circuit considered in\nAllbaugh,295 F.3d 28. There, the Executive Order \"provide[d] that, to the\nextent permitted by law, no federal agency, and no entity that receives\nfederal assistance for a construction project, may either require bidders or\ncontractors to enter, or prohibit them from entering, into a project labor\nagreement (PLA).\" Id. at 29. As the Allbaughcourt recognized, the\npermitted-by-law qualifier \"instructs the agency to follow the law.\" Id. at\n33. Thus, \"if an executive agency, such as the FEMA, may lawfully\nimplement the Executive Order, then it must do so; if the agency is\nprohibited, by statute or other law, from implementing the Executive\nOrder,\" then it may not. Id. The court went on to conclude that \" [t]he mere\n55\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 65 of 87\npossibility that some agency might make a legally suspect decision to\naward a contract or to deny funding for a project does not justify an\ninjunction against enforcement of a policy that, so far as the present record\nreveals, is above suspicion in the ordinary course of administration.\" Id.\nThe same is true here, and a contrary decision would expand this\nCourt's decision in San Franciscoin a way that not only is inconsistent with\nprecedent from other circuits but also would sweep so broadly as to be\nplainly incorrect. It is commonplace for Executive Branch officials to\nannounce broad policy priorities and direct their subordinates to\nimplement them, to the extent consistent with law. There is no basis for\nallowing such directives to be invalidated merely because- as the\ndirectives themselves contemplate- implementation of those priorities\nmay in some circumstances be constrained by the law. Doing so would\neliminate an important tool that allows high-level officials to give direction\nto their subordinates without working out every detail of implementation\nor addressing every potential legal hurdle. This Court concluded in San\nFrancisco that the general presumption that a directive to act only as\nconsistent with law means what it says was overcome based on the\n56\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 66 of 87\nparticular circumstances of that case,but the case cannot properly be read\nto treat such directives as a nullity across the board.\nb. Relatedly, three of plaintiffs' as-applied challenges -those for\ngrants under the Ryan White Program, the HOPWA program, and as\nFQHCs - suffer from threshold problems because plaintiffs identify no\ngrant that has been terminated under those statutes (though, even if they\ndid, their claims would properly be pursued only under the Tucker Act as\ndiscussed above). Any claim that terminations for those grants would be\nunlawful is therefore unripe for review. It is entirely speculative whether\nagencies will disagree with the arguments made by plaintiffs and the\ndistrict court and conclude that grants awarded under those statutes can be\nterminated notwithstanding the Executive Qrders' direction that grants\nmust be terminated only to the extent consistent with law. And as\ndiscussed above, if any such grant is terminated by an agency, the\nappropriate course is for plaintiffs to challenge that particular termination\nin an appropriate venue, not to seek a blunderbuss pre-enforcement\ninjunction. Any such case would allow evaluation of the agency's actual\ninterpretation of the statutory provisions at issue, rather than getting courts\n57\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 67 of 87\nahead of agencies and resolving hypothetical disputes with no\nadministrative record.\nFinally, the district court's decision as to the remaining two\nc.\nstatutes -the Affordable Care Act and Public Health Service Act -\ncollapses entirely with its analysis of plaintiffs' equal-protection claim. The\ncourt concluded that, for the same reasons plaintiffs were likely to succeed\non their equal protection claim, they were likely to show that the Gender\nIdeology Order violates specific antidiscrimination provisions contained in\nthose two statutes. ER-54-55. For the reasons given above, supra pp. 47-53,\nthat is wrong because the district court's conclusion that the Gender\nIdeology Order discriminates based on sex or transgender status was error.\nII. The RemainingEquitable Factors Favor the Government.\nThe balance of equities and the public interest counsel against a\npreliminary injunction. See inken U. Holder,556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (noting\nthat these factors merge in cases involving the government). In particular,\nthe district court's order will cause significant and irreparable harm to the\ngovernment. The court's injunction restrains the government from carrying\nout lawful and important policies with respect to federal funding priorities.\n\"Under our Constitution, the 'executive power' - all of it- is vested ina\n58\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 68 of 87\nPresident,\" who must \"take Care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Sella\nLaw LLC U.

The President also has\nauthority, \"as head of the Executive Branch, to 'supervise and guide'\nexecutive officers in 'their construction of the statutes under which they\nact.\"' Qffice of Legal Counsel,Proposed Executive Order Entitled \"Federal\nRegulation, \" 5 OP~ C).L.C. 59, 60 (1981) (quotingMyers U. United States, 272\nU.S. 52, 135 (1926))\nThe extraordinary injunction in this case interferes with these core\nexecutive functions and prevents the President from directing and\ncontrolling executive officers in their exercise of lawful authority. The\nchallenged provisions simply guide agencies' exercise of pre-existing\nauthority to terminate grants or contracts, and enjoining those directives\ninhibits agencies from exercising their authority in a way that furthers the\nPresident's priorities. The injunction thus inflicts irreparable constitutional\nharm by eroding the President's control over subordinates and frustrates\nthe public's interest in having the elected President effectuate policy\n59\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 69 of 87\npriorities through lawful direction of the executive branch. As the Supreme\nCourt has emphasized, under the \"constitutional strategy\" chosen by the\nFramers, individual executive officials' authority \"remains subject to the\nongoing supervision and control of the elected President.\" Sella,591 U.S. at\n224. The district court's assertion of authority to parse and analyze the way\nthe President provides that supervision and direction unlawfully usurps\nthe President's Article II authority.\nBeyond the harms to the President's ability to execute core Executive\nBranch policies, the order irreparably harms the public fisc. The order\nrequires the agencies to reinstate grantees' access to funds. ER-5-7. As in\nDepartment of Education U. California and NIH U. American Public Health\nAss '12, the government \"is unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are\ndisbursed.\" 145 S. Ct. at 969. Thus, the challenged order will result in the\nimmediate outflow of significant amounts of money from the public fisc\nand limited prospects for recovery if it is ultimately determined that the\ngrant terminations were lawful. Conversely, even absent preliminary relief,\nnothing would prevent plaintiffs from seeking an order to restore \" any\nwrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum.\"\nCalifornia,145 S. Ct. at 969.\n60\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 70 of 87\nIn contrast, the gravamen of plaintiffs' claim is monetary- they ask\nto continue receiving funds under their grant agreements during the\npendency of this litigation. The \"possibility that adequate compensatory or\nother corrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary\ncourse of litigation, [weighs] heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.\"\nDennis Melancon, Inc. U. City 0fNew Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 279 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(alteration in original) (quotation omitted) .\nFinally, the Supreme Court recently assessed the equitable factors in\ntwo cases involving materially similar injunctive relief-California and\nNIH -and its weighing of the equities in a stay posture in those cases\ndemonstrates that the balance weighs against an injunction. As the Court\nexplained, the government suffers irreparable harm because it is \"unlikely\nto recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.\" 145 S. Ct. at 969. The\nSupreme Court has since reiterated that its stay decisions \"inform how a\ncourt should exercise its equitable discretion in likecases\";accordingly, the\nSupreme Court's balancing of the equities \"squarely contro1[s]\" here.\nTrump U. Boyle,No. 25A11, 2025 WL 2056889 (U.S. July 23, 2025).\n61\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 71 of 87\nIII. At the Very Least, the Injunction is Overbroad.\nEven if the district court did not err in granting plaintiffs' motion for\na preliminary injunction, the injunction order it issued should still be\nvacated and remanded in part because it is overbroad. The district court\nconcluded that the challenged termination provisions are likely unlawful\nand enjoined defendants from enforcing those provisions against plaintiffs\nor taking other action to implement those provisions. But the district\ncourt's injunction went further and ordered defendants to reinstate a list of\nspecific grant and contract awards (and any other grant award that had\nbeen terminated since plaintiffs' complaint was filed) regardless of whether\nthose awards were terminated pursuant to the challenged provisions. ER-5-\n7.\nIn addition to being beyond the district court's jurisdiction due to the\npreclusive effect of the Tucker Act, that aspect of the injunction is plainly\ndivorced from plaintiffs' claims and the district court's legal conclusions.\nPlaintiffs have not established any likelihood of success or harm arising\nfrom any grants or contracts that were terminated for some reason\nindependent of the challenged Executive Order provisions. This Court\nshould therefore, at the very least, vacate the injunction to the extent it\n62\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 72 of 87\nrequires defendants to reinstate grants or contracts that were not\nterminated pursuant to the challenged termination provisions and\n(assuming the Court rejects the government's Tucker Act argument)\nremand to the district court to determine in the first instance whether any\nof the grants and contracts listed in paragraph 2 of its order (or any other\ngrants) were in fact terminated pursuant to the challenged provisions.\n63\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 73 of 87\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's preliminary injunction\nshould be vacated or, at the very least, vacated in part.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBRETT A.

Reg 8339\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws\nof the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose and Policy. The Biden Administration forced illegal and\nimmoral discrimination programs, going by the name \"diversity, equity,\nand inclusion\" (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government,\nin areas ranging from airline safety to the military. This was a concerted\neffort stemming from President Biden's first day in office, when he issued\nExecutive Order 13985, \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for\nUnderserved Communities Through the Federal Government.\"\nPursuant to Executive Order 13985 and follow-on orders, nearly every\nFederal agency and entity submitted \"Equity Action Plans\" to detail the\nways that they have furthered DEIs infiltration of the Federal Government.\nThe public release of these plans demonstrated immense public waste and\nshameful discrimination. That ends today. Americans deserve a\ngovernment committed to serving every person with equal dignity and\nrespect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making\nAmerica great.\nSec. 2. Implementation.\n(a) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),\nassisted by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM), shall coordinate the termination of all\ndiscriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and \"diversity, equity,\ninclusion, and accessibility\" (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs,\npreferences and activities in the Federal Government, under whatever\nname they appear. To carry out this directive, the Director of OPM,\nwith the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall review\nand revise, as appropriate, all existing Federal employment practices,\nunion contracts, and training policies or programs to comply with this\norder. Federal employment practices, including Federal employee\nperformance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills,\nperformance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances\nconsider DEI or DEIA factors, goals, policies, mandates, or\nrequirements.\nA2\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 81 of 87\n(b) Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with\nthe Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OPM, as\nappropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty days of this\norder:\n(i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA,\nand \"environmental justice\" offices and positions (including but not\nlimited to \"Chief Diversity Officer\" positions); all \"equity action\nplans,\" \"equity\" actions, initiatives, or programs, \"equity-related\"\ngrants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements\nfor employees, contractors, or grantees.\n(ii) provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all:\n(A) agency or department DEI, DEIA, or \"environmental justice\"\npositions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets,\nand expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an\nassessment of whether these positions, committees, programs,\nservices, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been\nmisleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-\nNovember 4, 2024 function;\n(B) Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI\ntraining materials to agency or department employees; and\n(C) Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or\nadvance DEI, DEIA, or \"environmental justice\" programs,\nservices, or activities since January 20, 2021 .\n(iii) direct the deputy agency or department head to:\n(A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires)\nand cost of the prior administration's DEI, DEIA, and\n\"environmental justice\" programs and policies; and\n(B) recommend actions, such as Congressional notifications under\n28 U.S.C. 530D, to align agency or department programs,\nactivities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices,\nenforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants,\nconsent orders, and litigating positions with the policy of equal\ndignity and respect identified in section 1 of this order. The\nagency or department head and the Director of OMB shall\nA3\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 82 of 87\njointly ensure that the deputy agency or department head has\nthe authority and resources needed to carry out this directive.\n(c) To inform and advise the President, so that he may formulate\nappropriate and effective civil-rights policies for the Executive Branch,\nthe Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall convene a\nmonthly meeting attended by the Director of OMB, the Director of\nOPM, and each deputy agency or department head to:\n(i) hear reports on the prevalence and the economic and social costs\nof DEI, DEIA, and \"environmental justice\" in agency or department\nprograms, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment\npractices, enforcement activities, contracts (including setasides),\ngrants, consent orders, and litigating positions;\n(ii) discuss any barriers to measures to comply with this order; and\n(iii) monitor and track agency and department progress and identify\npotential areas for additional Presidential or legislative action to\nadvance the policy of equal dignity and respect.\nSec. 3. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any\nprovision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the\nremainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other\npersons or circumstances shall not be affected.\nSec. 4. General Provisions.\n(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise\naffect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or\nagency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and\nBudget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and\nsubject to the availability of appropriations.\nA4\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 83 of 87\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or\nbenefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by\nany party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or\nentities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.\nExecutive Order 14,168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology\nExtremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,90\nFed. Reg 8615\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws\nof the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United\nStates Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological\nreality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive\nmeans to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate\nsingle-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women's\ndomestic abuse shelters to women's workplace showers. This is wrong.\nEfforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack\nwomen by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The\nerasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on\nwomen but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal\npolicy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and\ntrust in government itself.\nThis unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against\nthe ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and\nscientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an\ninternal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.\nInvalidating the true and biological category of \"woman\" improperly\ntransforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities\ninto laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding,\nA5\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 84 of 87\ncherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social\nconcept.\nAccordingly, my Administration will defend women's rights and protect\nfreedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies\nthat recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically\nmale.\nSec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to\nrecognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and\nare grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my\ndirection, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to\npromote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all\nExecutive interpretation of and application of Federal law and\nadministration policy:\n(a) \"Sex\" shall refer to an individual's immutable biological\nclassification as either male or female. \"Sex\" is not a synonym for and\ndoes not include the concept of \"gender identity.\"\n(b) \"Women\" or \"woman\" and \" girls\" or \" girl\" shall mean adult and\njuvenile human females, respectively.\n(c) \"Men\" or \"man\" and \"boys\" or \"boy\" shall mean adult and juvenile\nhuman males, respectively.\n(d) \"Female\" means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that\nproduces the large reproductive cell.\n(e) \"Male\" means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that\nproduces the small reproductive cell.\n(f) \"Gender ideology\" replaces the biological category of sex with an\never-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the\nfalse claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice\nversa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim\nas true. Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum\nof genders that are disconnected from one's sex. Gender ideology is\ninternally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or\nuseful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a\nperson to be born in the wrong sexed body.\nA6\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 85 of 87\n(g) \"Gender identity\" reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of\nself, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an\ninfinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for\nidentification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.\nSec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men.\n(a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external\npartners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based\ndefinitions set forth in this order.\n(b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing\nsex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to\nprotect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency\nshould therefore give the terms \"sex\", \"male\", \"female\", \"men\",\n\"women\", \"boys\" and \"girls\" the meanings set forth in section 2 of this\norder when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance\nand in all other official agency business, documents, and\ncommunications.\n(c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every\nagency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on\nbehalf of their agency shall use the term \"sex\" and not \" gender\" in all\napplicable Federal policies and documents.\n(d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of\nthe Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to\nrequire that government-issued identification documents, including\npassports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder's\nsex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the\nCffice of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel\nrecords accurately report Federal employees' sex, as defined by section\n2 of this order.\n(e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms,\ncommunications, or other internal and external messages that promote\nor otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such\nstatements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other\nmessages. Agency forms that require an individual's sex shall list male\nA7\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 86 of 87\nor female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all\nnecessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of\ngender ideology.\n(f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court's decision\nin Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-\nsex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments\nAct. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The\nAttorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to\nagencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court's decision\nin Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency\nactivities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and\nassist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly\npermitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent.\n(g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each\nagency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and\nensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\nSec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces.\n(a) The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall\nensure that males are not detained in women's prisons or housed in\nwomen's detention centers, including through amendment, as\nnecessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and\ninterpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n(b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare\nand submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the\nfinal rule entitled \"Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual's\nGender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs\"\nof September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public\ncomment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters.\n(c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises\nits policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and\nshall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical\nprocedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an\ninmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.\nA8\n\nCase: 25-4988, 09/04/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 87 of 87\n(d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to\nensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or\nfor men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity.\nSec. 5. Protecting Rights. The Attorney General shall issue guidance to\nensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to\nsingle-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney\nGeneral, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head\nwith enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize\ninvestigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified.\n* * *\nSec. 8. General Provisions.\n(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise\naffect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or\nagency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and\nBudget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and\nsubject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or\nbenefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by\nany party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or\nentities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to\nany person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this\norder and the application of its provisions to any other persons or\ncircumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.\nA9",

Case No. 25-cv-01824-JST   \n7 \nFOUNDATION, et al.,   \n \n8 \nPlaintiffs, \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND \n9  DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR \nv. \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n10 \nDONALD J. TRUMP, et al.,  Re: ECF No. 47 \n11 \nDefendants. \n \n12 \ntr ain     \nuoro 13  Within the first two days of taking office in January 2025, President Trump issued two \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Executive Orders aiming to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) programs within the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  government and private sector as well as an Executive Order targeting initiatives promoting \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “gender ideology,” or the idea that one can identify as a gender identity different from one’s sex \nS de nre 17  assigned at birth.  Plaintiffs1 are a group of nonprofit organizations that provide healthcare, social \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  services, and advocacy for LGBTQ2 communities—many specifically serving transgender \n19  individuals—and that rely heavily on federal funding to carry out their missions.  They move for a \n20  preliminary injunction enjoining nine provisions of those Executive Orders.  The Court will grant \n21  the motion in part and deny it in part. \n22  Of the nine Challenged Provisions, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they likely have \n23  standing to challenge: (1) a provision requiring them to certify that they do “not operate any \n24 \n \n1 Plaintiffs are Baltimore Safe Haven Corp (“BSH”); Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community \n25 \nCenter (“Bradbury-Sullivan”); FORGE, Inc. (“FORGE”); Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender \nHistorical Society (“GLBT Historical Society”); Los Angeles LGBT Center (“LA LGBT Center”); \n26 \nLesbian and Gay Community Services Center, Inc. d/b/a The LGBT Community Center (“NY \nLGBT Center”); Prisma Community Care (“Prisma”); San Francisco Aids Foundation (“SFAF”); \n27 \nAsian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, Inc. d/b/a San Francisco Community Health Center \n(“SFCHC”). \n28 \n2 As used in this Order, LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 2 of 52\n \n1  programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws” (the \n2  “Certification Provision”); (2) a provision directing agencies to terminate funding for all ‘“equity-\n3  related grants or contracts” (the “Equity Termination Provision”); and (3) two provisions \n4  commanding agencies to terminate funding for any programs that “promote gender ideology” (the \n5  “Gender Termination Provision” and “Gender Promotion Provision”). \n6  These three funding provisions reflect an effort to censor constitutionally protected speech \n7  and services promoting DEI and recognizing the existence of transgender individuals.  These \n8  provisions seek to strip funding from programs that serve historically disenfranchised populations \n9  in direct contravention of several statutes under which Plaintiffs receive funding.  Plaintiffs have \n10  therefore demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that these provisions violate their \n11  rights under the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Separation of Powers.  Plaintiffs, \n12  however, have not demonstrated that they likely to succeed in their challenge to the Certification \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Provision because they have not shown at this juncture that the provision goes beyond targeting \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  DEI programs that violate federal antidiscrimination law.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  While the Executive requires some degree of freedom to implement its political agenda, it \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  is still bound by the Constitution.  And even in the context of federal subsidies, it cannot \nS d nr\nee 17  weaponize Congressionally appropriated funds to single out protected communities for disfavored \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  treatment or suppress ideas that it does not like or has deemed dangerous.  It further cannot do so \n19  in such a vague manner that all federal grantees and contractors are left to wonder what activities \n20  or expression they can engage in without risking the funding on which they depend.   \n21  Absent injunctive relief, Plaintiffs face the imminent loss of federal funding critical to their \n22  ability to provide lifesaving healthcare and support services to marginalized LGBTQ populations. \n23  This loss not only threatens the survival of critical programs but also forces Plaintiffs to choose \n24  between their constitutional rights and their continued existence. \n25  Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the \n26  Equity Termination Provision, Gender Termination Provision, and Gender Promotion Provision \n27  against them.   The Court addresses the parties’ arguments and explores the Court’s reasoning for \n28  granting Plaintiffs’ motion in part and denying it in part more fully below. \n2 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 3 of 52\n \n1  I.

That same day, he also \n6  signed Executive Order 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025), “Ending Radical and Wasteful \n7  Government DEI3 Programs and Preferencing” (“DEI-1 Order”).  On January 21, President Trump \n8  signed Executive Order 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633, “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring \n9  Merit-Based Opportunity” (“DEI-2 Order”) (collectively, “Challenged Orders”).  \n10  Plaintiffs move to enjoin the enforcement of the following provisions of the Challenged \n11  Orders against them:  Section 3(e) of the Gender Order (the “Gender Termination Provision”); \n12  Section 3(g) of the Gender Order (the “Gender Promotion Provision”); Section 4(d) of the Gender \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Order (the “Intimate Spaces Provision”); Section 2(b)(i) of the DEI-1 Order (the “Equity \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Termination Provision”); Section 2(b)(ii)(C) of the DEI-1 Order (the “List Provision”); Section \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  3(c)(ii) of the DEI-2 Order (the “DEIA Principles Provision”); Section 3(c)(iii) of the DEI-2 Order \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (the “Diversity Termination Provision”); Section 3(b)(iv)(A)-(B) of the DEI-2 Order (the \nS d nr\nee 17  “Certification Provision”); and Section 4(b) of the DEI-2 Order (the “Enforcement Threat \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Provision”) (collectively, the “Challenged Provisions”).  The language of these provisions is \n19  described further below.   \n20  B.  Defendants \n21  Defendants are President Donald J. Trump;4 the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); the \n22  Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”); the Office of Management and \n23  Budget (“OMB”); the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”); the U.S. Department of Health and \n24  Human Services (“HHS”); the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”); \n25  the National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”); the National Endowment for the \n26 \n \n3 As used in this order, DEI stands for “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” and DEIA stands for \n27 \n“diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.” \n4 Plaintiffs seek only declaratory relief against President Trump, and the motion before the Court \n28 \ndoes not seek injunctive relief against him.  ECF No. 47 at 10 n.1. \n3 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 4 of 52\n \n1  Humanities (“NEH”); and the highest-ranking officials within those agencies allegedly responsible \n2  for implementing the Executive Orders, including Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Acting Labor \n3  Secretary Vince Micone, Acting OFCCP Director Michael Schloss, OMB Director Russell \n4  Vought, HHS Secretary Robert K.

Plaintiffs \n7  Plaintiffs are a group of nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding to support their work \n8  providing services to “members of the LGBTQ communities.”  ECF No. 47 at 12.  “Speech, \n9  advocacy, and services advancing the civil rights and welfare of transgender and other LGBTQ \n10  people, and addressing systemic racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ bias, are central to each \n11  Plaintiff’s mission.”  Id.  Plaintiffs contend that they cannot “advertise, provide services, train \n12  staff, train other agencies or providers, or accomplish their core mission and mandates under \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  existing grants while simultaneously complying with the Executive Orders.”  ECF No. 47 at 20–\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  21 (citing ECF Nos. 47-1 ¶¶ 10–14; 47-2 ¶¶ 26–28; 47-3 ¶¶ 20–21; 47-4 ¶¶ 12–13, 24; 47-7 ¶¶ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  16–34; 47-5 ¶ 21; 47-8 ¶ 25; 47-9 ¶¶ 10–13, 34–47; 47-10 ¶ 23); see also ECF No. 47-10 ¶ 23 (“If \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the Executive Orders are allowed to stand, SFCHC will face the impossible choice of abandoning \nS d nr\nee 17  our mission to provide targeted, culturally competent care to marginalized communities, or forfeit \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the federal funding supporting many of our lifesaving services.”). \n19  SFAF is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California, that “promotes health, \n20  wellness, and social justice for communities most affected by HIV, through sexual health and \n21  substance use services, advocacy, and community partnerships.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 15.  Specifically, \n22  SFAF “confronts and combats HIV-related health disparities among gay and bisexual men, \n23  transgender women, cisgender women, Black people, Latinx people, and, in particular, people \n24  residing at the intersections of these identities.”  Id. ¶ 45.  “For Fiscal Year 2025–2026, SFAF is \n25  contracted to receive $2,275,557.00 in direct and indirect funding.  Of this amount, $641,625.00 is \n26  directly funded through agreements with CDC, and the balance of $1,633,952.00 is indirectly \n27  funded by a variety of federal agencies through subcontracts with state and local agencies.”  ECF \n28  No. 47-9 ¶ 5.  “SFAF’s core HIV prevention efforts rely on federal funding to provide services \n4 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 5 of 52\n \n1  such as testing, treatment, PrEP, PEP, harm reduction, and telehealth to underserved \n2  communities.”  Id. ¶ 11. \n3  GLBT Historical Society is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California, \n4  that “collects, preserves, exhibits, and makes accessible to the public materials and knowledge to \n5  support and promote understanding of LGBTQ history, culture, and arts in all their diversity.”  \n6  ECF No. 1 ¶ 16.  “The organization was founded during the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; \n7  community members began collecting materials belonging to primarily gay and bisexual men who \n8  were dying of AIDS-related illnesses when families of origin had abandoned them, and healthcare \n9  systems and the government had failed them.”  ECF No. 47-4 ¶ 5.  GLBT Historical Society \n10  receives federal funding primarily from the NEH and the National Archives through the National \n11  Historic Publications and Records Commission (“NHPRC”), including current funding from an \n12  open NHPRC grant of approximately $122K to support work to “process, digitize, and create \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  online access for collections related to LGBTQ+ Asian American/Pacific Islander people” and “an \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  open NEH grant of around $10K that supports the purchase of a new archival storage cabinet.”  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Id. ¶ 14. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  SFCHC is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California, that “seeks to \nS de nre 17  celebrate and attend to the health and wellness of the communities that define San Francisco—\nth\nintr\nUoN 18  immigrant and communities of color, queer, transgender, unhoused people, and all who are most \naffected by oppression—through comprehensive medical, dental, and mental health services.”  \n19 \nECF No. 1 ¶ 17.  SFCHC currently receives more than $5 million in federal grant funding, \n20 \nincluding several grants from the CDC and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n21 \nAdministration to provide HIV-related health services to transgender people and young people of \n22 \ncolor.  ECF No. 47-10 ¶¶ 5–8.  \n23 \nLA LGBT Center is a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles, California, that “offers \n24 \nprograms, services, and advocacy spanning four broad categories: (i) health, (ii) social services \n25 \nand housing, (iii) culture and education, and (iv) leadership and advocacy” to fulfill its mission of \n26 \n“build[ing] a world in which LGBTQ people thrive as healthy, equal, and complete members of \n27 \nsociety.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 18.  LA LGBT Center states that “nearly every aspect of the services \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 6 of 52\n \n1  provided by the LA LGBT Center directly or indirectly impacts the transgender community, and \n2  the LA LGBT Center has provided its services to more than 6,000 transgender individuals over the \n3  past ten years—the majority of such services relating to their medical care.”  ECF No. 47-5 ¶ 5.  \n“A significant portion of the LA LGBT Center’s revenue comes from federal programs, including, \n4 \nbut not limited to, direct funding from the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Violence \n5 \nAgainst Women and the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) divisions: Centers for \n6 \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC); Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) \n7 \nBureau of Primary Health Care, under which the LA LGBT Center is a Federally Qualified Health \n8 \nCenter (FQHC); and the Administration for Children Youth & Families.”  Id. ¶ 7.  The LA LGBT \n9 \nCenter is scheduled to receive $22 million of federal funding for use over the next several years.  \n10 \nId. \n11 \n  Prisma is a nonprofit organization based in Phoenix, Arizona, that “offers a wide variety of \n12 \n \na\ntr in healthcare services, including services related to HIV, sexual health, gender-affirming care, and \nuoro 13 \nC tfila mental and social wellness” to carry out its mission of providing “affirming and inclusive services \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo to promote well-being and advance health equity for diverse communities particularly people of \niD tc 15 \n seirt color, 2SLGBTQIA+ and queer individuals, and those affected by HIV.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 19.  Prisma \ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr “receives over three million dollars in federal funding, either directly or as pass-through funding \nee 17 \nth\nintr through state agencies like the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS).”  ECF No. 47-8 ¶ \nUo\nN 18 \n9. \n19 \n  NY LGBT Center is a nonprofit organization based in New York, New York, that was \n20 \n“established in 1983 at the height of the AIDS crisis to provide a safe and affirming place for \n21 \nLGBTQ New Yorkers to respond to the urgent threats facing the community.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 20.  \n22 \nNY LGBT Center “provides recovery and wellness programs, economic advancement initiatives, \n23 \nfamily and youth support, advocacy, arts and cultural programming, and space for community \n24 \norganizing, connection, and celebration.”  Id.  “Over $2 million of the NY LGBT Center’s annual \n25 \nbudget comes from federal funding, both in direct grants from federal agencies and in pass-\n26 \nthrough federal funds received from New York State agencies.  This accounts for approximately \n27 \n12% of the NY LGBT Center’s annual budget.”  ECF No. 47-7 ¶ 13.  These federal funds “are \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 7 of 52\n \n1  used to support services including substance use treatment and prevention, youth programming, \n2  HIV testing and prevention, mental health counseling, case management, support for survivors of \n3  violence, training for clinicians and capacity building for other providers on working with the \n4  LGBTQ+ community, and more.”  Id. ¶ 15. \n5    Bradbury-Sullivan is a nonprofit organization based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, that \n6  “provides a vibrant, inclusive space in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley for all the region’s LGBTQ \n7  residents, offering affirming programming and health programs” to fulfill its mission of \n8  “provid[ing] safe and celebratory spaces for the LGBTQ community.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 21.  About \n9  62% of Bradbury-Sullivan’s budget comes from federal sources, including the CDC, through pass-\n10  through contracts with state and local agencies such as the Pennsylvania Department of Health.  \n11  ECF No. 47-2 ¶ 7. \n12    BSH is a nonprofit organization based in Baltimore, Maryland, that provides \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  “comprehensive support services for marginalized TLGBQIA+ people, especially focusing on \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Black transgender women navigating survival mode living.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 22.  BSH asserts that its \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  origin as “an organization created by transgender people for transgender people [] makes it \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  imperative that [it] not only fight injustices against transgender people but provide our services to \nS d nr\nee 17  our community in a culturally competent way.  It is the cornerstone of [BSH’s] identity.”  ECF \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  No. 47-1 ¶ 10.  Approximately “80% of BSH’s budget comes from federal grant money,” \n19  including “$3 million in operating funds via federal grant money, whether directly or as a \n20  subgrantee.”  Id. ¶ 9.  One such grant includes “$182,000 grant of funding from the Centers for \n21  Disease Control and Prevention (‘CDC’) via the Baltimore City Health Department \n22  (‘BCHD’) . . . through the CDC’s High lmpact HIV and Surveillance Programs for Health \n23  Departments.”  Id.  “When the BCHD issued its request for proposals from subgrantees, it \n24  specifically invited proposals for HIV-prevention programs with a focus on transgender people in \n25  the zip codes BSH most regularly serves.”  Id. \n26    FORGE is a nonprofit organization based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that “offers programs \n27  and services to reduce the impact of trauma on transgender and nonbinary survivors of violence by \n28  empowering service providers, advocating for systems reform, and connecting survivors to healing \n7 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 8 of 52\n \n1  possibilities.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 23.  About “90% of FORGE’s revenue arises from federal programs \n2  and grants, including but not limited to grants from the DOJ Offices for Victims of Crime (OVC), \n3  Justice Programs (OJP), and Violence Against Women (OVW) and National Institute of Justice \n4  (NIJ), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the \n5  National Institutes of Health National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIH-\n6  NIAAA).”  ECF No. 47-3 ¶ 7.  These federally funded grants support FORGE’s initiatives, \n7  “including the development of training materials and direct support services for transgender and \n8  nonbinary survivors.”  Id. \n9    Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on February 20, 2025.

Related Litigation \n12  Several plaintiffs have filed other cases challenging various provisions of the orders \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  challenged here.  Without providing an exhaustive summary of all such cases, the Court briefly \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  recounts the cases involving issues similar to those here. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  1.  National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  In National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump, the District \nS d nr\nee 17  Court for the District of Maryland granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  enjoining the enforcement of the Equity Termination Provision, the Certification Provision, and \n19  the Report Provision on a nationwide basis.  No. 25-cv-333 (ABA), 2025 WL 573764, at *27–30 \n20  (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025).  The court held that the Equity Termination Provision was likely void for \n21  vagueness under the Fifth Amendment.  Id. at *19–21.  It also held that the plaintiffs’ First \n22  Amendment challenge to the Certification Provision was likely to succeed on the merits.  See id. at \n23  *21–23.  Finally, it held that the Enforcement Threat Provision likely violated the First \n24  Amendment and was also unconstitutionally vague.  See id. at *24, 26.   \n25  The Fourth Circuit stayed that decision pending appeal.  See Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity \n26  Officers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, No. 25-1189, ECF No. 29 (4th Cir. Mar. 14, 2025).  The panel \n27  held that the government had carried its burden of “satisf[ying] the factors for a stay,” including \n28  likelihood of success on the merits.  Id. at 2; see also id. at 7 (Harris, J., concurring).  In her \n8 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 9 of 52\n \n1  concurrence explaining the reasoning of the panel, Judge Harris noted that the DEI-1 and DEI-2 \n2  Orders “are of distinctly limited scope” and that nothing in their text “purport[s] to establish the \n3  illegality of all efforts to advance diversity, equity or inclusion.”  Id. at 7 (Harris, J., concurring). \n4  She found that the Certification Provision and Enforcement Threat Provision “appl[ied] only to \n5  conduct that violates existing federal anti-discrimination law” and that the DEI-1 and DEI-2 \n6  Orders did not “authorize the termination of grants based on a grantee’s speech or activities \n7  outside the scope of the funded activities.”  Id.  Lastly, Judge Harris explained that her “vote to \n8  grant the stay comes with a caveat,” explaining that “[a]gency enforcement actions that go beyond \n9  the Orders’ narrow scope may well raise serious First Amendment and Due Process concerns, for \n10  the reasons cogently explained by the district court.”  Id.  \n11  2.  Chicago Women in Trades \n12  In the Northern District of Illinois, Chicago Women in Trades—a national nonprofit \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  organization—sought a temporary restraining order enjoining the DOL, the OMB, the DOJ, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the heads of those agencies from enforcing parts of the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders.  See Chi. Women \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in Trades v. Trump, No. 25-cv-2005 (MFK), 2025 WL 933871, at *1–2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2025) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (“CWIT I”).  The court granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the DOL and its Acting \nS d nr\nee 17  Secretary from enforcing the Certification Provision on a nationwide basis and from enforcing the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Equity Termination Provision against the plaintiff.  See id. at *10–13.  But the court reconsidered \n19  part of its decision upon ruling on the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  See Chi. \n20  Women in Trades v. Trump, No. 25-cv-2005 (MFK), 2025 WL 1114466 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2025) \n21  (“CWIT II”).  The court reaffirmed that the Certification Provision likely violated the First \n22  Amendment.  In particular, it noted: \n \n23  The Order that contains the Certification Provision does not define \nthe term “DEI” itself, and it does not refer to any other source \n24  indicating what the term means as used in the Order—let alone what \nmight make any given “DEI” program violate Federal anti-\n25  discrimination laws.  And although the government emphasized, \nboth in its briefing and at oral argument, that the Certification \n26  Provision implicates only illegal DEI programs, it has studiously \ndeclined to shed any light on what this means. \n27   \n28  2025 WL 1114466, at *11.  However, the court changed its holding as to the Equity Termination \n9 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 10 of 52\n \n1  Provision and found that provision likely did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendments.  See \n2  id. at 12–16.  In addition, the court found that the Equity Termination Provision likely violated the \n3  Separation of Powers under the Spending Clause as to one specific grant.  See id. at 16–18. \n4  3.  PFLAG, Inc.  \n5  In the District of Maryland, six individual transgender plaintiffs who were seeking gender \n6  affirming care and two national nonprofit organizations that supported transgender individuals in \n7  seeking medical treatment for gender dysphoria moved for an emergency temporary restraining \n8  order.  PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 510050, at *1–3 (D. Md. Feb. 14, \n9  2025) (“PFLAG I”).  They sought an order enjoining various government defendants from \n10  enforcing the Gender Promotion Provision of the Gender Order and a provision of  Executive \n11  Order 14187, 90 Fed. Reg. 8771 (Jan. 28, 2025), “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical \n12  Mutilation,” which directed all federal agencies to “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  mutilation of children.”  Id.  The court granted the temporary restraining order and found that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the challenged provisions there \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  violated the Separation of Powers, conflicted with statutory law, and violated the Fifth \nS d nr\nee 17  Amendment’s guarantee to equal protection.  See id. at *13–21.  The court then reaffirmed those \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  findings upon issuing a preliminary injunction.  PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, \n19  2025 WL 685124, at *14–28 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025) (“PFLAG II”). \n20  4.  National Urban League \n21  In the District of Columbia, three national nonprofit organizations moved for a preliminary \n22  injunction regarding enforcement of eight of the nine Challenged Provisions.5  Nat’l Urb. \n23  League v. Trump, No. CV 25-471 (TJK), 2025 WL 1275613, at *3 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025).  The \n24  court found that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge only the Gender Termination Provision, \n25  Gender Promotion Provision, Equity Termination Provision, and Certification Provision.  See id. \n26  at *10–13.  The court then held that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their \n27 \n \n28 \n5 The plaintiffs there did not challenge the Intimate Spaces Provision. \n10 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 11 of 52\n \n1  challenges under the First and Fifth Amendments as to those provisions because the “government \n2  need not subsidize the exercise of constitutional rights to avoid infringing them, and the \n3  Constitution does not provide a right to violate federal antidiscrimination law.”  Id. at *1, 13–26.  \n4  II.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD \n5  Injunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \n6  showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n7  22 (2008).  To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, a plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to \n8  succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \n9  relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \n10  interest.”  Id. at 20.  A court may “balance the elements” of this test, “so long as a certain \n11  threshold showing is made on each factor.”  Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. \n12  2011) (per curiam).  Thus, for example, “serious questions going to the merits and a balance of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  injunction is in the public interest.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted). \nS d nr\nee 17  III.  THRESHOLD CHALLENGES \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The Court addresses as a threshold matter Plaintiffs’ standing to bring this lawsuit. \n19  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101-02 (1998). \n20  A.  Article III Standing \n21  Article III standing requires that a “plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) \n22  that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be \n23  redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016).  \n24  “To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered ‘an invasion of a legally \n25  protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or \n26  hypothetical.’”  Id. at 339 (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). \n27  Because “[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these \n28  elements,” they are “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \n11 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 12 of 52\n \n1  Accordingly, “each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the \n2  plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the \n3  successive stages of the litigation.”  Id. at 561.  \n4  1.  List Provision and Enforcement Threat Provision \n5  The “List Provision” directs each agency and department to provide the Director of the \n6  OMB with a list of all “Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, \n7  DEIA, or ‘environmental justice’ programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.”  DEI-1 \n8  Order § 2(b)(ii)(C).  The Enforcement Threat Provision directs the Attorney General to submit a \n9  report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.  The report shall, in relevant part: \n10  contain the “most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern” and \n11  include a “plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles . . . that \n12  constitute illegal discrimination or preferences,” wherein “each agency shall identify up to nine \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  potential civil compliance investigations of . . . large non-profit corporations or associations.”  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  DEI-2 Order § 4(b). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs appear to argue primarily that creating lists of organizations engaged in DEI or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  illegal DEI chills protected speech and that Plaintiffs would suffer reputational harm if they were \nS d nr\nee 17  placed on those lists.  See ECF No. 47 at 20; ECF No. 64 at 15.  But the List Provision operates \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  intragovernmentally—directing all agencies and departments to submit a list to the OMB Director \n19  of all grantees who receive federal funding for DEI programs.  It does not instruct the Director to \n20  do anything with the list or even publicly disseminate the list.  It is thus unclear how the creation \n21  of an internal, intragovernmental list would operate to chill speech, particularly given that \n22  Plaintiffs have not stated an intent to discontinue their DEI activities if such a list is created.  \n23  Plaintiffs have thus failed to adequately identify any injury that is “concrete and particularized” or \n24  any future injury that is imminent, rather than conjectural or hypothetical.  See Spokeo, Inc., 578 \n25  U.S. at 339 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)). \n26  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Enforcement Threat Provision, which also operates \n27  intragovernmentally, suffers from a similar flaw.  Plaintiffs argue that requiring “government \n28  officials to produce lists of private citizens expressing disfavored views” gives rise to \n12 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 13 of 52\n \n1  constitutional concerns and risks causing Plaintiffs reputational harm.  ECF No. 64 at 20.  In doing \n2  so, Plaintiffs rely heavily on Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123 \n3  (1951).  In that case, the Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently stated claims that \n4  they were defamed by the Attorney General’s arbitrary designation of their organizations as \n5  Communist on a list of subversives given to the Loyalty Review Board of the United States Civil \n6  Service Commission.  See id. at 124–25, 139–41.  Critically, the plaintiffs there had already been \n7  labeled as Communist and contested the basis of that classification.  See id.  Here, however, \n8  Plaintiffs’ theory of harm requires speculation as to the content of a report that has not yet \n9  issued—assuming that the report will identify Plaintiffs’ sectors as “sectors of concern” and then \n10  identify them as some of the “most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners” in those \n11  sectors.  Alternatively, the report would have to identify Plaintiffs as the subjects of nine or fewer \n12  potential total civil compliance investigations—if Plaintiffs even qualify as “large non-profit \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  corporations or associations.”  Their theory thus rests “on a highly attenuated chain of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  possibilities” that “does not satisfy the requirement that threatened injury must be certainly \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  impending.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 410; see also Nat’l Urb. League, 2025 WL 1275613, at *7–8 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (finding that the plaintiffs there lacked standing to challenge the Enforcement Threat Provision for \nS d nr\nee 17  the same reasons); CWIT I, No. 25 C 2005, 2025 WL 933871, at *2 (“[I]t is difficult to see how \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  CWIT can be in imminent danger of an injury based on a provision that simply requires a cabinet \n19  official to issue a report at a future date.”).  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not \n20  sufficiently demonstrated any injury or imminent likelihood of injury resulting from the List \n21  Provision or the Enforcement Threat Provision. \n22  2.  Intimate Spaces Provision, DEIA Principles Provision, and \nDiversity Termination Provision \n23 \nThe Intimate Spaces Provision provides that “[a]gencies shall effectuate this policy by \n24 \ntaking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or \n25 \nfor men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity.”  Gender Order § 4(d).  While the \n26 \nCourt is unsure what exactly the Intimate Spaces Provision calls for, Plaintiffs do not sufficiently \n27 \nallege any injury specifically flowing from this provision.  Indeed, despite identifying it as one of \n28 \n13 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 14 of 52\n \n1  the provisions they challenge, they do not otherwise reference this provision specifically in their \n2  briefing.  The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the Intimate Spaces \n3  Provision.  \n4  Relatedly, the DEIA Principles Provision and Diversity Termination Provision fall under \n5  Section 3 of the DEI-2 Order, titled “Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal \n6  Government.”  The full subsection they fall under, Section 3(c), provides:  \n \n7  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with \nthe assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:  \n8   \n(i)  Review  and  revise,  as  appropriate,  all  Government-wide \n9  processes, directives, and guidance; \n(ii)  Excise  references  to  DEI  and  DEIA  principles,  under \n10  whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, \ncontracting,  grants,  and  financial  assistance  procedures  to \n11  streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, \nlower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and \n  12  (iii)  Terminate  all  ‘diversity,’  ‘equity,’  ‘equitable  decision-\na\ntr in making,’ ‘equitable deployment of financial and technical \nuoro 13  assistance,’  ‘advancing  equity,’  and  like  mandates, \nCfi\n tla requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.”  DEI-2 \nciC 14  Order § 3(c)(iii).   \nrts fo\niD tc 15  DEI-2 Order § 3(c) (emphasis added).  Both provisions appear to—consistent with Defendants’ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  representations, ECF No. 64 at 19–20—apply internally within the government and to the \nS d nr\nee 17  government’s own processes, directives, and programs.  While the Court wonders whether the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  scope of the language in this provision could be applied to result in injury to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs \n19  have not adequately alleged what injuries they suffer from these two provisions.  Unlike the \n20  Equity Termination Provision, the Diversity Termination Provision does not clearly implicate any \n21  of Plaintiffs’ programs or activities, as Plaintiffs have not alleged that they conduct any \n22  programming for the government.  See CWIT I, 2025 WL 933871, at *2 (finding that the plaintiff \n23  there lacked standing to challenge the Diversity Termination Provision because the provision \n24  focuses on “internal government agency processes and programs”).  And a reading of the \n25  Diversity Termination Provision to apply externally would render it duplicative of the Equity \n26  Termination Provision.   \n27  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs likely lack standing to challenge the Intimate \n28  Spaces Provision, DEIA Principles Provision, and Diversity Termination Provision. \n14 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 15 of 52\n \n3.  Equity Termination Provision, Gender Termination Provision, and \n1  Gender Promotion Provision \n2  Three of the Challenged Provisions regard the ineligibility of federal funding for certain \n3  categories of grants or contracts.  The Equity Termination Provision directs, in relevant part, each \n4  agency, department, or commission head to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, \n5  all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts.”  DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(i).  The Gender Termination \n6  Provision provides that agencies “shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the \n7  Federal funding of gender ideology.”  Gender Order § 3(e).  And the Gender Promotion Provision \n8  states, “Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess \n9  grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”  \n10  Gender Order § 3(g) (collectively, the “Funding Provisions”). \n11  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged standing to challenge the Funding \n12  Provisions because a “loss of funds promised under federal law[] satisfies Article III’s standing \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  requirement.”  See City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (quoting Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 965 (9th Cir. 2015)); see \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  also Nat’l Urb. League, 2025 WL 1275613, at *13 (finding that the plaintiff there had standing to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  challenge the same Funding Provisions).    \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs challenge the Funding Provisions in part on the basis that they have lost or will \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  likely lose federal funding for their organizational activities.  For example, on February 1, 2025, \n19  SFCHC received a notice from Defendant HHS terminating, “in accordance with the [Gender \n20  Order],” SFCHC’s grant award for “Comprehensive High-Impact HIV Prevention Programs for \n21  Young Men of Color Who Have Sex With Men and Young Transgender Persons of Color,” \n22  effective January 31, 2025.  ECF No. 47-10, Ex. C.6  Prisma and NY LGBT Center have also each \n23  received termination notices citing to the Challenged Orders.  See ECF No. 47-8, Ex. A \n24  (termination notice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) explaining that \n25  to implement DEI-1 Order, Prisma must “immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all \n26 \n \n27 \n6 On February 12, 2025, SFCHC received a notice that the termination was rescinded pursuant to \nthe temporary restraining order that was issued by a federal district court in Rhode Island.  See id., \n28 \nEx. D. \n15 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 16 of 52\n \n1  programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) at \n2  every level and activity” that was supported by CDC funds); ECF No. 47-8, Ex. B (termination \n3  notice from the CDC to Prisma explaining that to implement the Gender Order, “any vestige, \n4  remnant, or re-named piece of any gender ideology programs funded by the U.S. government \n5  under this award are immediately, completely, and permanently terminated”); ECF No. 47-7, Ex. \n6  A (termination notice from the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), a \n7  component of HHS, stating that effectively immediately, HRSA grant funds “may not be used for \n8  activities that do not align with” the DEI-1 Order or the Gender Order and that any “vestige, \n9  remnant, or re-named piece of any programs in conflict with these E.O.s are terminated in whole \n10  or in part”).  These grant terminations—both threatened and actual—constitute “a classic \n11  pocketbook injury sufficient to give [them] standing.”  Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631, \n12  636 (2023); see also, e.g., Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 243 (2021) (describing “pocketbook \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  injury” as “a prototypical form of injury in fact”).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because their injuries are neither traceable to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  these provisions nor redressable.  First, they argue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  terminations are fairly traceable to the Funding Provisions because the provisions did not directly \nS d nr\nee 17  terminate any particular fund or program and instead “merely provided policy directives to federal \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  agencies.”  ECF No. 61 at 22.7  Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ injuries are not \n19  redressable because “even if this Court granted relief against the Executive Orders, that would not \n20  prevent defendant agencies from exercising their own independent authorities to determine \n21  whether, consistent with law, any termination of a fund/contract would be warranted.”  ECF No. \n22  61 at 23.   \n23  As for traceability, the Court does not read the Funding Provisions to consist of only \n24  “policy directives.”  They command specific action.  See DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(i) (each agency \n25  “shall” terminate all equity-related grants or contracts (emphasis added)); Gender Order § 3(e) \n26 \n \n7 Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have not provided any termination letters stating that their \n27 \ngrants were terminated pursuant to the Challenged Orders.  Id.  But as discussed above, \nDefendants’ argument is flatly contradicted by the record.   \n28 \n \n16 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 17 of 52\n \n1  (each agency “shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of \n2  gender ideology” (emphasis added)); Gender Order § 3(g) (each agency “shall assess grant \n3  conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology” \n4  (emphasis added)).  Moreover, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have already received notices \n5  pursuant to the Challenged Orders terminating their grant awards.  See ECF No. 47-10, Ex. C; \n6  ECF No. 47-8, Ex. A; ECF No. 47-8, Ex. B; ECF No. 47-7, Ex. A. \n7  Furthermore, an order enjoining Defendants from enforcing those provisions against \n8  Plaintiffs would redress their injuries of losing grant funding by making them less likely to suffer \n9  monetary harm.  And Defendants’ speculation that the Defendant agencies might nevertheless still \n10  terminate Plaintiffs’ funding for other reasons does not defeat redressability at this stage.  For one \n11  thing, the Court rejects the suggestion that a court should not enjoin unlawful activity simply \n12  because a defendant might theoretically achieve the same outcome by different, lawful means.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Illegality is illegality.  In any event, as the requested relief need only be likely—not guaranteed in \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  fact—to alleviate Plaintiffs’ injury.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see also Nat’l Urb. League, 2025 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  WL 1275613, at *11 & n.4 (rejecting the defendants’ speculative causation and redressability \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  arguments regarding the same provisions). \nS d nr\nee 17  The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they have standing to challenge \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the Equity Termination Provision, Gender Termination Provision, and Gender Promotion \n19  Provision. \n20  4.  Certification Provision \n21  The Certification Provision requires the head of each agency to include in every contract or \n22  grant award (1) a term “requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its \n23  compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the \n24  government’s payment decisions for purposes of” the False Claims Act, and (2) a term “requiring \n25  such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that \n26  violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.”  DEI-2 Order § 3(b)(iv)(A)-(B). \n27    The Certification Provision directly affects Plaintiffs because of their activities as federal \n28  grantees.  The additional terms in each federal contract or grant award create new obligations for \n17 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 18 of 52\n \n1  Plaintiffs.  As another court explained, Plaintiffs are likely “to face the ‘forced choice’ that the \n2  Certification Provision presents: change their programming to enable them to make the \n3  certification; make the certification without changes and risk a false certification; or give up \n4  federal funds and contracts.”  Nat’l Urb. League, 2025 WL 1275613, at *11 (finding that the \n5  plaintiff there had standing to challenge the Certification Provision for this reason) (quoting \n6  Stavrianoudakis v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 108 F.4th 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2024)).  And as with \n7  above, the Court finds Defendants’ traceability and redressability arguments unpersuasive because \n8  the Certification Provision expressly requires agencies to include the two terms requiring \n9  certification.  An injunction enjoining Defendants from enforcing the Certification Provision \n10  would thus redress Plaintiffs’ alleged injury of having to either modify their conduct or risk \n11  making a false certification.   \n12  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately shown that they have standing to challenge \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the Certification Provision.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  B.  Tucker Act \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Defendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs’ claims relating to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the termination or prospective termination of their grants because the Tucker Act provides that the \nS d nr\nee 17  United States Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over contract claims against the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  United States.  ECF No. 61 at 23–25 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)).  They further argue that the \n19  Tucker Act still applies despite Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims because a “suit belongs in the \n20  Claims Court when the source of plaintiffs’ asserted right is a contract and what plaintiffs seek \n21  amounts to contractual remedies.”  ECF No. 61 at 24 (citing Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 604 \n22  U.S.---, 145 S.Ct. 966, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025)). \n23  The Tucker Act provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over \n24  actions based upon “any express or implied contract with the United States” exceeding $10,000.  \n25  See 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a).  But “the mere fact that a court may rule on a contract issue does \n26  not . . . automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of \n27  jurisdiction it might otherwise have.”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. \n28  1982).  Instead, an action triggers the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional hook only when the claim is “at \n18 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 19 of 52\n \n1  its essence” a contract claim.  Id. at 967.  “[W]here there is a possible alternative basis for \n2  jurisdiction independent of the Tucker Act,” a court “must be more deliberat[ive] in [its] \n3  examination” of whether the particular action is “one which is or is not ‘at its essence’ a contract \n4  action.”  Id. at 968.  To determine the essence of an action, courts look at the source of the rights \n5  on which the plaintiff bases its claims and the type of relief sought.  See United Aeronautical \n6  Corp. v. United States Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023) (citing cases which in turn \n7  cite Megapulse).  “If rights and remedies are statutorily or constitutionally based, then districts \n8  courts have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies are contractually based then only the Court of \n9  Federal Claims does, even if the plaintiff formally seeks injunctive relief.”   Id (emphases in \n10  original). \n11    Here, Plaintiffs’ claims are not “at [their] essence” contract actions because both the source \n12  of the rights claimed and the remedies sought are not contractually based.  Plaintiffs’ claims are all \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  based upon the Constitution—arising under the First and Fifth Amendments, the Spending Clause, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and the Separation of Powers.  These are not breach of contract claims just because they “requir[e] \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  some reference to or incorporation of a contract.”  See Megapulse, Inc., 672 F.2d at 967–68.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Similarly, Plaintiffs seek exclusively injunctive and other equitable relief.  See ECF No. 1 at 71–\nS d nr\nee 17  72 (seeking declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and costs and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reasonable attorney’s fees).  And while an injunction precluding Defendants from terminating \n19  grants awarded to Plaintiffs would in effect require the government to keep funding those grants, \n20  “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient \n21  reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, \n22  893 (1988).  Indeed, the Court of Federal Claims “has no power to grant equitable relief” and thus \n23  cannot address the remainder of the relief sought by Plaintiffs.  See id. at 905 (citation omitted). \n24    Defendants’ reliance on the two-page, per curiam opinion in Department of \n25  Education v. California does not change the Court’s analysis.  In that case, the plaintiffs asserted \n26  only a claim that the government’s termination of grants was arbitrary and capricious under the \n27  Administrative Procedures Act.  Dep’t of Educ., 145 S.Ct. at 968–69.  The Supreme Court found \n28  the government was “likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction” and that \n19 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 20 of 52\n \n1  jurisdiction would likely lie in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.  Id. at 969–70.  \n2  The case involved neither claims asserting the infringement of constitutional rights, a request for \n3  declaratory judgment, nor a request for injunctive relief preventing future harm.  The Court \n4  therefore finds Department of Education v. California distinguishable and concludes that the \n5  Tucker Act does not preclude Plaintiffs from proceeding in district court.  See CWIT II, 2025 WL \n6  1114466, at *9–10 (concluding the same for the plaintiff’s identical set of claims challenging the \n7  DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders). \n8  C.  Third-Party Standing \n9  The parties dispute whether Plaintiffs have third-party standing to assert the equal \n10  protection rights of their transgender patients, clients, and patrons to challenge the Gender \n11  Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision.  \n12  The default rule is that “a litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests, and \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”  Powers v. Ohio, 499 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  U.S. 400, 410 (1991).  To depart from that rule and assert a third party’s right: (1) “[t]he litigant \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  must have suffered an ‘injury in fact;’” (2) “the litigant must have a close relationship to the third \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  party;” and (3) “there must exist some hindrance to the third party’s ability to protect his or her \nS d nr\nee 17  own interests.”  Id. at 410–11 (citation omitted). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  First, as discussed above, the Gender Order imposes actual and threatened loss of funding \n19  to Plaintiffs such that Plaintiffs themselves have adequately demonstrated an injury in fact.  \n20  Second, Plaintiffs provide a variety of healthcare services to transgender individuals within their \n21  communities, including HIV-testing and treatment, gender-affirming care, substance use treatment \n22  and prevention.  ECF No. 47-9 ¶ 11; ECF No. 47-10 ¶¶ 5–8;  ECF No. 1 ¶ 19; ECF No. 47-7 ¶ 15.  \n23  As healthcare providers, Plaintiffs have a close relationship to their transgender patients and are \n24  likely “fully, or very nearly, as effective a proponent of the right” as those patients.  Washington v. \n25  Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1160 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114–16 \n26  (1976)); see also Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 485 F. \n27  Supp. 3d 1, 35 (D.D.C. 2020) (finding that ‘“there can be no doubt’ that the health-provider \n28  Plaintiffs will be ‘motivated, effective advocate[s]’ for their LGBTQ patients” (quoting Powers, \n20 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 21 of 52\n \n1  499 U.S. at 414)).  Indeed, many of the named plaintiffs were founded specifically to serve \n2  transgender people.  See, e.g., ECF No. 47-1 ¶ 10; ECF No. 47-3 ¶19 (“[E]very aspect of our \n3  programming and services revolve[s] around transgender and nonbinary survivors and the \n4  providers who serve them.”); ECF No. 47-5 ¶ 5 (“Respecting transgender people and advancing \n5  their civil rights is central to the LA LGBT Center’s identity, advocacy, and mission, and a \n6  necessary part of every aspect of the services we provide.”); ECF No. 47-7 ¶¶ 31–34 (“One of the \n7  NY LGBT Center’s core purposes is recognizing and affirming the existence of transgender and \n8  gender-diverse individuals. . . .  Compliance with the Executive Order would dismantle the NY \n9  LGBT Center’s identity, rendering us incapable of serving the community we were established to \n10  support.”). \n11  Finally, Plaintiffs’ transgender patients and clients likely face barriers to being able to \n12  protect their own interests under these circumstances.  Defendants argue that because other \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  individual plaintiffs have initiated lawsuits challenging the Gender Order, including by making \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  equal protection claims, “this is not a case where individual litigants face ‘daunting’ barriers or \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  have ‘little incentive’ to litigate their own claims.”  ECF No. 61 at 45 (quoting Powers, 499 U.S. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  at 414–15).  However, Plaintiffs need only show “some hindrance” to the ability of their patients \nS d nr\nee 17  to vindicate their rights, see Powers, 499 U.S. at 410–11, and Plaintiffs have done so.  Many of the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  transgender persons they serve are some of the most vulnerable members of society, experiencing \n19  poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 47-1 ¶¶ 11, 14; 47-4 ¶ 11; 47-5 \n20  ¶¶ 13, 21; 47-6 ¶¶ 8, 18, 21; 47-7 ¶¶ 9, 17; 47-9 ¶¶ 19, 21; 47-10 ¶¶ 10, 14, 21–22.  “[D]ue to the \n21  sensitive nature of the subject matter, fear of retaliation from the federal government, and lack of \n22  capacity and/or financial resources, [] Plaintiffs’ patients [and clients] are hindered from \n23  protecting their own interests.”  Washington v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-00244-LK, 2025 WL 659057, \n24  at *8 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025).  And transgender individuals in particular face obvious barriers \n25  to filing suit to assert their own rights, since disclosure of their transgender status exposes them to \n26  “a substantial risk of stigma, discrimination, intimidation, violence, and danger.”  Arroyo \n27  González v. Rosselló Nevares, 305 F.Supp.3d 327, 333 (D.P.R. 2018); see also Whitman-Walker \n28  Clinic, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 36. (“It is enough that patients’ fear of stigmatization operates as a \n21 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 22 of 52\n \n1  powerful deterrent to bringing suit.”). \n2  The Court thus rejects Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim fails for \n3  lack of standing.  See ECF No. 61 at 45. \n4  IV.  LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS \n5  A.  Fifth Amendment Equal Protection \n6  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “[n]o person \n7  shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. \n8  Amend. V.   The “Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the Federal Government to \n9  deny equal protection of the laws.”  Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234 (1979) (internal \n10  quotation marks omitted).  “When considering an equal protection claim,” the Court determines \n11  “what level of scrutiny applies to a classification under a law or policy, and then decide[s] whether \n12  the policy at issue survives that level of scrutiny.”  Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1073 (9th Cir. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  2024).  The Ninth Circuit has held that “discrimination on the basis of transgender status is a form \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of sex-based discrimination” for equal protection purposes.  Id.  So if a law “discriminates based \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  on transgender status, either purposefully or on its face, heightened scrutiny applies.”  Doe v. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Horne, 115 F.4th 1083, 1102 (9th Cir. 2024); see also Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200–\nS d nr\nee 17  01 (9th Cir. 2019).  “To withstand heightened scrutiny, a classification ‘must serve important \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.’”  \n19  Horne, 115 F.4th at 1106  (quoting Clark ex rel. Clark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d \n20  1126, 1127 (9th Cir. 1982)).  “The State bears the burden of demonstrating an ‘exceedingly \n21  persuasive justification’ for the classification, and ‘[t]he justification . . . must not rely on \n22  overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and \n23  females.’”  Id. at 1106–07 (quoting United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531, 533 (1996)). \n24    Plaintiffs argue that the Gender Order violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal \n25  protection because it “purposefully discriminates based on transgender status and it facially \n26  classifies based on transgender status and sex.”  ECF No. 47 at 36.  They further contend that \n27  heightened scrutiny applies and that the funding provisions of the Gender Order fail heightened \n28  scrutiny because “directing agencies and federal grantees to” disapprove of transgender people is a \n22 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 23 of 52\n \n1  “plainly illegitimate purpose[].”  Id. at 37–38. \n2  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of \n3  their equal protection challenge to the Gender Termination Provision and the Gender Promotion \n4  Provision.   \n5  1.  Heightened Scrutiny \n6  Defendants do not contest that heightened scrutiny applies to discrimination based on \n7  transgender status.  Instead, they argue that (1) the Gender Order is merely rhetoric, not \n8  discriminatory action; and that (2) the funding provisions of the Gender Order “do not purport to \n9  withhold federal funding based on any protected characteristic of the recipients; they merely \n10  realign the government’s funding of particular topics.”  ECF No. 61 at 43 (emphasis in original).  \n11  This argument is not persuasive.   \n12  First, Defendants’ argument that the Gender Order is mere “rhetoric” flies in the face of the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  facts, given that Defendants have already terminated several of Plaintiffs’ federal grants pursuant \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to that order.  SFCHC received a notice from the HHS specifically terminating SFCHC’s grant for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  its Comprehensive High-Impact HIV Prevention Programs for Young Men of Color Who Have \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Sex With Men and Young Transgender Persons of Color “in accordance with the [Gender \nS de nre 17  Order]” effective January 31, 2025.  ECF No. 47-10, Ex. C (emphasis added).8  That grant funds \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “the San Francisco Bay Transgender Alliance for Health Resources (STAHR), a program to \n19  reduce and prevent new cases of HIV transmission among young trans people of color (YTPC) \n20  and their partners in San Francisco and Alameda Counties in accordance with both the HIV \n21  National Strategic Plan and the CDC’s High-Impact, Status-Neutral HIV Prevention approach.”  \n22  ECF No. 47-10 ¶ 5.   \n23  Furthermore, Prisma, SFCHC, NY LGBT Center, and SFAF have each received a notice \n24  from a government agency informing them that any programs in conflict with the Gender Order \n25  and funded by the federal government are immediately and permanently terminated.  See ECF \n26 \n \n27 \n8 On February 12, 2025, SFCHC received a notice that the termination was rescinded pursuant to \nthe temporary restraining order that was issued by a federal district court in Rhode Island.  See id., \n28 \nEx. D. \n23 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 24 of 52\n \n1  Nos. 47-7, Ex. A; 47-8, Ex. B; 47-10, Ex. B; 77-3, Ex. C.  While the government has apparently \n2  added an element of confusion by leaving these grantees to deduce for themselves which particular \n3  grants have been terminated, there is no doubt that the actions are not merely rhetorical.   \n4  Second, the Gender Order withholds federal funding based on the transgender status of the \n5  individuals that grantees serve, rather than based on “topics” as Defendants argue.  To adopt \n6  Defendants’ cramped reading requires ignoring the plainly intended consequences flowing from \n7  the Gender Termination and Gender Promotion Provisions.  As Plaintiffs point out, the Gender \n8  Order imposes federal funding restrictions that preclude providing health and social services that \n9  “acknowledge the existence of transgender people because doing so in the operation of such \n10  programs is considered the ‘promotion of gender ideology.’”  ECF No. 64 at 26; see Gender Order \n11  § 2(f) (defining “gender ideology” as “replac[ing] the biological category of sex with an ever-\n12  shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  as and thus become women and vice versa,” and “includ[ing] the idea that there is a vast spectrum \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex”).  In other words, these orders require grantees, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  who provide specialized services to transgender persons, to remove references to those persons—\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  as well as the characteristics that caused those persons to need the services in the first place.  It is \nS d nr\nee 17  as difficult to imagine how this would work as it is to imagine a pediatrician not acknowledging \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the existence of children or a gerontologist denying the existence of the elderly.  The Gender \n19  Termination and Gender Promotion Provisions thus collapse content-based discrimination (as \n20  Defendants appear to concede) with status-based discrimination by excluding protected \n21  communities from receiving federally-funded services.  Take, for example, SFCHC’s operation of \n22  an emergency shelter designed for transgender and non-binary individuals experiencing \n23  homelessness.  See ECF No. 47-10 ¶ 12(e).  The Gender Termination and Gender Promotion \n24  Provisions would terminate federal grants used for that project but place no similar restrictions on \n25  shelters designed to house only cisgender men or cisgender women.  By singling out grants that \n26  serve transgender people, the Gender Order necessarily singles out transgender people and \n27  excludes them from being able to benefit from federal funds.   \n28  In addition to facially discriminating based on transgender status, the Gender Termination \n24 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 25 of 52\n \n1  and Gender Promotion Provisions purposefully discriminate based on transgender status.  “A \n2  discriminatory purpose is shown when ‘the decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular \n3  course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an \n4  identifiable group.”  Horne, 115 F.4th at 1103 (quoting Pers. Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 \n5  (1979)).  Here, the Gender Order’s stated purpose is to deny the existence of transgender persons \n6  entirely.  See Gender Order § 2 (“It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male \n7  and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible \n8  reality.”).   \n9    Accordingly, because the Gender Termination and Gender Promotion Provisions \n10  discriminate based on transgender status, both purposefully and on their face, heightened scrutiny \n11  applies.  See Horne, 115 F.4th at 1102. \n12  2.  Governmental Interest \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs argue that the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  fail any level of scrutiny because the Gender Order is “transparently motivated by a ‘bare desire to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  harm’ transgender people.”  ECF No. 47 at 36 (quoting Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (1996)).  Defendants offer no response in their opposition, nor any argument that either provision \nS de nre 17  advances any legitimate government interest, and thus concede the point.9  See Tyler v. Travelers \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Com. Ins. Co., 499 F. Supp. 3d 693, 701 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (“Plaintiff concedes these arguments by \n19  failing to address them in her opposition.” (collecting cases)). \n20  Indeed, the Gender Order’s express purpose is to disapprove of transgender people and \n21  declare their existence as “unmoored from biological facts” and “false.”  See Gender Order §§ 1, \n22  2(f).  This facially discriminatory objective—achieved here by denying federal funding only to \n23 \n \n24 \n9 Defendants at hearing argued that it is actually Plaintiffs who waived their arguments here \nbecause they did not properly identify the Gender Termination Provision or Gender Promotion \n25 \nProvision as the provisions they were challenging in their opening motion.  The Court finds that \nwhile Plaintiffs could have been more explicit, Defendants received reasonable notice that \n26 \nPlaintiffs were primarily challenging those two funding provisions of the Gender Order in their \nmotion.  See, e.g., ECF No. 47 at 34–35 (“Moreover, the Gender Order facially discriminates \n27 \nbased on sex. It directs agencies to withhold grants from entities that ‘promote gender ideology \n. . . .’”).  Further, Defendants made no attempt to respond to Plaintiffs’ argument that the Gender \n28 \nOrder advanced no legitimate governmental interest.  Defendants’ argument is thus unavailing. \n25 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 26 of 52\n \n1  grantees who recognize the existence of transgender people—is not a legitimate government \n2  interest, let alone one that justifies the overt discrimination practiced here.  See Horne, 115 F.4th \n3  at 1108 (finding that a sweeping ban on transgender girls from playing on sports teams did not \n4  satisfy heightened scrutiny because the ban was not substantially related to achievement of a \n5  legitimate state interest).  As one other court considering the Gender Order explained, the Court \n6  “cannot fathom discrimination more direct than the plain pronouncement of a policy resting on the \n7  premise that the group to which the policy is directed does not exist.”  PFLAG II, 2025 WL \n8  685124, at *23. \n9  Accordingly, the Court finds that the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion \n10  Provision do not serve important governmental objectives sufficient to survive heightened \n11  scrutiny.  Plaintiffs have thus shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their equal \n12  protection claim. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  B.  First Amendment Claims \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The First Amendment prohibits the government from “abridging the freedom of speech.” \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. I).  Ordinarily, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it \nS d nr\nee 17  conveys.”  Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of U. Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995).  But in the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  context of federal funding, the government may place attach certain conditions to eligibility for \n19  that funding even if those conditions “may affect the recipient’s exercise of its First Amendment \n20  rights.”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214 (2013) (“AID”).  \n21  That is because “if a party objects to a condition on the receipt of federal funding, its recourse is to \n22  decline the funds,” id., and the “refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated \n23  with the imposition of a ‘penalty’ on that activity.”  United States v. Am. Libr. Ass’n, Inc., 539 \n24  U.S. 194, 212 (2003) (plurality opinion) (quoting Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991)).  \n25  However, there are still limitations on the types of conditions that the government may attach to \n26  federal funds without violating the First Amendment.   \n27  First, “a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment \n28  rights” if the condition “seek[s] to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the \n26 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 27 of 52\n \n1  program itself.”  AID, 570 U.S. at 214–15.  As noted by the Supreme Court, “conditions that \n2  define the federal program and those that reach outside it—is not always self-evident.”  Id. at 217.  \n3  But where the government “has placed a [speech] condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather \n4  than on a particular program or service,” that condition can violate the First Amendment.  Id. at \n5  218–19 (quoting Rust, 500 U.S. at 197) (emphasis in original).  Furthermore, a funding condition \n6  that “is not relevant to the objectives of the program” can also place an unconstitutional burden on \n7  First Amendment rights.  See id. at 214.  This includes where a funding statute has “no \n8  programmatic message . . .  to allow the Government to [regulate speech as] deemed necessary for \n9  its legitimate objectives . . . .”  Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 548 (2001).  \n10  Importantly, the government “cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its \n11  program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.”  Id. at \n12  547.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Second, “even in the provision of subsidies, the government may not ‘ai[m] at the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  suppression of dangerous ideas.’”  Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (1998) (quoting Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 550 (1983)).  As \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  recognized by the Ninth Circuit, the line of Supreme Court unconstitutional-conditions cases \nS d nr\nee 17  “teaches that the government can violate the First Amendment by withholding benefits for a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  censorious purpose . . . .”  Koala v. Khosla, 931 F.3d 887, 898 (9th Cir. 2019) (“The Speiser-\n19  Perry-Regan-Finley line of cases reflects the Supreme Court’s continued cautionary admonition \n20  that the First Amendment will not tolerate the administration of subsidy programs with a \n21  censorious purpose.” (citing Regan, 461 U.S. at 548; Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518–19 \n22  (1958); Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972); Finley, 524 U.S. at 587)). \n23  1.  Gender Termination, Gender Promotion, and Equity \n24  Termination Provisions \n25  Defendants primarily argue that the Funding Provisions “do not seek to regulate a \n26  grantee’s speech ‘outside the contours of’ any [] policy initiatives” paid for by the government.  \n27  ECF No. 61 at 33 (quoting AID, 570 U.S. at 218).  Further, they argue that “the government is \n28  permitted to have policy priorities, and it does not violate the First Amendment by not \n27 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 28 of 52\n \n1  affirmatively funding programs that do not align with those policies.”  Id.  \n2  The Court finds that even if the Funding Provisions apply only to activities paid for by the \n3  federal government—rather than to the recipients’ private activity10—their blanket withholding of \n4  funding for all programs that are “equity-related” or that “promote gender ideology” is entirely \n5  untethered to any “legitimate objective[]” or “programmatic message” of the programs they \n6  burden to justify their intrusion on protected speech.  See Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 548; see also  \n7  AID, 570 U.S. at 214.  Defendants hang their hat on the argument that the Funding Provisions \n8  limit Plaintiffs’ speech only while they are on the government’s dime.  But “funding by the \n9  Government, even when coupled with the freedom of the fund recipients to speak outside the \n10  scope of the Government-funded project, is [not] invariably sufficient to justify Government \n11  control over the content of expression.”  Rust, 500 U.S. at 199.   \n12    An examination of two relevant unconstitutional conditions cases illustrates why the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  government’s intrusion on speech is not permissible even in the context of federal subsidies.  In \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Rust, the Supreme Court upheld regulations that prohibited “counseling, referral, and the provision \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of information regarding abortion as a method of family planning” because they were “designed to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ensure that the limits of the federal program are observed,” i.e., that the “Title X program is \nS d nr\nee 17  designed not for prenatal care, but to encourage family planning.”  Rust, 500 U.S. at 193–94.  The \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Court thus reasoned that Rust was “not a case of the Government ‘suppressing a dangerous idea,’ \n19  but of a prohibition on a project grantee or its employees from engaging in activities outside of the \n20  project’s scope.”  Id.  Critically, the Court explained, “we have here not the case of a general law \n21  singling out a disfavored group on the basis of speech content, but a case of the Government \n22  refusing to fund activities, including speech, which are specifically excluded from the scope of the \n23 \n \n24 \n10 The Court does note that it is unclear whether the provisions could be interpreted to apply to \nregulating expression outside of the grant-funded activity—for example, an organization’s name \n25 \ncontaining “equity-related” terms or terms that “promote gender ideology” as defined by the \nGender Order.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs point to Defendant HHS’s February 10, 2025, “issuance of \n26 \na Secretarial Directive to ‘avoid[] the expenditure of federal funds on programs, or with \ncontractors or vendors, that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) \n27 \ninitiatives.’”  ECF No. 64 at 16 (quoting ECF No. 64-4 at 1).  This directive suggests that the \nengagement of any DEI activity at all—regardless of whether it’s on the government’s dime—\n28 \ncould make an organization ineligible to receive federal funds. \n28 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 29 of 52\n \n1  project funded.”  Id. at 194–95.  “The condition that federal funds will be used only to further the \n2  purposes of a grant does not violate constitutional rights.”  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. at 198 \n3  (emphasis added). \n4  Then, in Velazquez, the Supreme Court examined the Legal Services Corporation Act, \n5  which established the Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”) to distribute federal funds to eligible \n6  local grantee organizations for the purpose of providing legal assistance to indigent individuals.  \n7  531 U.S. at 536.  The Court found unconstitutional under the First Amendment a provision of the \n8  Act that prohibited an LSC grantee from representing clients if the grantee challenged the validity \n9  of the underlying welfare statutes and regulations.  See id. at 549.  In distinguishing Rust, the \n10  Court again noted that “Title X did not single out a particular idea for suppression because it was \n11  dangerous or disfavored; rather, Congress prohibited Title X doctors from counseling that was \n12  outside the scope of the project.”  Id. at 541 (citing Rust, 500 U.S. at 194–95).  “[A]nd in the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  context of [the LSC] statute there is no programmatic message of the kind recognized in Rust and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  which sufficed there to allow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  legitimate objectives.  This serves to distinguish § 504(a)(16) from any of the Title X program \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  restrictions upheld in Rust, and to place it beyond any congressional funding condition approved \nS d nr\nee 17  in the past by this Court.”  Id. at 548. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Here, the Funding Provisions more closely resemble the condition found unconstitutional \n19  in Velasquez.  The Funding Provisions are not directed towards advancing any legitimate \n20  objectives embedded within the programs they burden—as appropriated and determined by \n21  Congress—but towards disfavored speech.  They categorically bar funding for any “equity-\n22  related” or “gender ideology” activity or expression, regardless of the scope of the contract or \n23  grant in question—including, as discussed below on the Separation of Powers, for contracts and \n24  grants that explicitly call for the consideration of equity.  As an example, Defendants took the \n25  position at hearing that an organization would lose its federal funding if it, in its day-to-day work \n26  on within the federally funded program, refers to clients by a pronoun other than Mr., Ms. Mrs., or \n27  Miss.  They also represented that if an organization is receiving federal funds to provide Covid-19 \n28  vaccines, it would not lose that funding for promoting gender ideology on its own dime and time \n29 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 30 of 52\n \n1  outside of the vaccination project.  But under Defendants’ logic, an organization receiving federal \n2  funds to provide public health services—as many of Plaintiffs do—would not be able to refer to \n3  the clients they serve under that project by any pronoun that would “promote gender ideology,” \n4  even when addressing them by such pronouns is pure speech that has no relation to the public \n5  health objectives for which the federal grants they receive aim to fund.  So unlike in Rust, where \n6  the government was merely “refusing to fund activities, including speech, which are specifically \n7  excluded from the scope of the project funded”—in that case, promoting family planning—the \n8  Funding Provisions “singl[e] out a disfavored group on the basis of speech content” with no \n9  specific relation to the program under which they are receiving funds.  See Rust, 500 U.S. at 194–\n10  95.  And the government “cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program \n11  [here], lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.”  Velazquez, 531 U.S. \n12  at 547. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Moreover, the Funding Provisions also violate the First Amendment by withholding \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  subsidies for a censorious purpose—aiming to suppress the dangerous ideas of “equity,” “DEI,” \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and “gender ideology.”  See Koala, 931 F.3d at 898; see also Finley, 524 U.S. at 587 (emphasizing \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that “even in the provision of subsidies, the government may not ‘ai[m] at the suppression of \nS d nr\nee 17  dangerous ideas’”).  Indeed, the express purpose of the Gender Order is to root out the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “extrem[e],” “false claims” of gender identity that contradict the government’s view that there is \n19  only one “biological reality of sex.”  See Gender Order §§ 1, 2(f).  Similarly, the DEI-1 Order \n20  aims to eliminate DEI- and equity-related expression that it considers “radical” and “immoral.”  \n21  See DEI-1 Order.  The government here is thus not merely selectively funding some programs but \n22  not others—it is rendering ineligible for federal funding all activities, speech, and conduct that is \n23  even related to the dangerous ideas it has identified.  And it has drawn that line based on \n24  viewpoint by targeting only speech that “promote[s] gender ideology” or that advances DEI and \n25  equity, while tolerating speech in opposition to those ideas.  This is precisely the kind of \n26  “invidious viewpoint discrimination” that the Supreme Court has suggested would present First \n27  Amendment concerns even in the context of federal subsidies.  See Finley, 524 U.S. at 587 \n28  (explaining that the result in Finley would likely be different “if the NEA were to leverage its \n30 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 31 of 52\n \n1  power to award subsidies on the basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on disfavored \n2  viewpoints”).  And the censorious purpose of the Funding Provisions together with their broad \n3  application to all recipients of federal funding ‘“prohibit[] a substantial amount of protected \n4  speech’ relative to [their] ‘plainly legitimate sweep,’” to justify the likelihood of success on a \n5  facial First Amendment challenge.  United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 770 (2023) (quoting \n6  United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292 (2008)).   \n7  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the \n8  merits on their First Amendment challenge as to the Gender Termination, Gender Promotion, and \n9  Equity Termination Provisions. \n10  2.  Certification Provision \n11  Defendants do not dispute that the Certification Provision applies to conduct outside of \n12  federally funded programs.  Instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s First Amendment challenge \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to the Certification Provision fails because they “have no First Amendment right to violate federal \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  antidiscrimination laws in the first place.”  ECF No 61 at 34.  Defendants also argue that requiring \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs to sign the Certification Provision for purposes of the False Claims Act does not violate \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the First Amendment because Plaintiffs would be able to rely on a good-faith defense as to their \nS d nr\nee 17  reasonable interpretation that their conduct does not violate federal antidiscrimination laws.  ECF \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  No. 61 at 35.   \n19  Plaintiffs counter that despite arguing that the Certification Provision only implicates DEI \n20  programs that “violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination law,” the government has not \n21  defined what that means and has made clear— through its actions—that it considers all DEI \n22  programs and initiatives to be unlawful.  See ECF No. 64 at 17, 19.  In other words, Plaintiffs \n23  argue that the Certification Provision does not mean what it says.  Plaintiffs thus argue that they \n24  have no way of knowing whether their activities would be considered legal or illegal DEI.  See id. \n25  at 17, 19, 23.   \n26  As evidence, Plaintiffs cite to the language of the DEI Orders and to the government’s \n27  termination of DEI programs.  Plaintiffs assert that the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders “categorically \n28  refer to ‘illegal DEI,’ without distinguishing between legal DEI and a subset that is supposedly \n31 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 32 of 52\n \n1  unlawful.”  ECF No. 64 at 22.  Further, “in implementing the Orders, Defendants have canceled \n2  funding for programs that are even tangentially related to DEIA, without any indication that they \n3  have deemed those programs illegal.”  Id. at 23.  Plaintiffs also cite to various remarks that \n4  President Trump has made, including that he committed to “end all of the Marxist diversity, \n5  equity, and inclusion policies across the entire federal government,” but also to “ban these \n6  unlawful policies from . . . the private sector as well,” and that he announced having “ended the \n7  tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal \n8  government and indeed the private sector and our military.”  ECF No. 64 at 16 (first quoting ECF \n9  No. 64-15 and then quoting ECF No. 64-3).   \n10  Plaintiffs further cite to the U.S. Attorney General’s memorandum interpreting the DEI-2 \n11  Order as “making clear that policies relating to ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (‘DEI’) and \n12  ‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (‘DEIA’) ‘violate the text and spirit of our \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  longstanding Federal civil-rights laws’ and ‘undermine our national unity,’” ECF No. 64 at 22–23 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (quoting ECF No. 64-18 at 1).  Plaintiffs contend that this memorandum demonstrates that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  government interprets all DEI or DEIA policies as violating federal anti-discrimination law.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  However, the same memorandum goes on to refer specifically to “illegal DEI and DEIA \nS d nr\nee 17  preferences” and clarifies that it “is intended to encompass programs, initiatives, or policies that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  discriminate, exclude, or divide individuals based on race or sex” and does not prohibit “events \n19  that celebrate diversity, recognize historical contributions, and promote awareness without \n20  engaging in exclusion or discrimination.”  ECF No. 64-18 at 1 & n.1. \n21  Although the Court agrees that the government has made little attempt to define the \n22  distinction between “legal” and “illegal” DEI, 11 Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence \n23  that the government has enforced or plans to enforce the Certification Provision in a way that \n24  implicates DEI programs beyond those that “violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination \n25  law.”  Indeed, Plaintiffs cite primarily to examples of the government’s termination of federally \n26 \n \n11 Indeed, Defendants struggled at hearing to provide any examples of DEI activities they would \n27 \nconsider legal besides the cultural celebrations referenced in the Attorney General’s memorandum.  \nSimilarly, they avoided providing any concrete examples of DEI activities that would violate \n28 \nfederal antidiscrimination law. \n32 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 33 of 52\n \n1  funded DEI programs.  But the provisions of the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders directing the \n2  termination of DEI and “equity-related” programs do not include the same limiting qualifier as the \n3  Certification Provision.  Instead, the termination provisions explicitly call for the termination of \n4  all federally funded DEI programs, regardless of whether those programs violate \n5  antidiscrimination law.  See DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(i) (directing each agency, department, or \n6  commission head terminate, in relevant part, all ‘“equity-related’ grants or contracts”); DEI-2 \n7  Order § 3(c)(iii) (directing the Director of the OMB to “[t]erminate all ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ \n8  ‘equitable decision-making,’ ‘equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,’ \n9  ‘advancing equity,’ and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate”).  \n10  The fact that the Certification Provision specifically includes the qualifier limiting the certification \n11  requirement to illegal DEI programs, when the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders elsewhere do not include \n12  that qualifier for termination of funding, suggests that the qualifier was intentional and should be \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  given meaning.  The Court thus agrees with Defendants that the Certification Provision does not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “penalize conduct beyond those prohibited by existing antidiscrimination laws.”  See ECF No. 61 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  at 30. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Moreover, ‘“[a]s is true of interpretation of statutes, the interpretation of an Executive \nS d nr\nee 17  Order begins with its text,’ which ‘must be construed consistently with the Order's ‘object and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  policy.’”  City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1238–39 (9th Cir. 2018) \n19  (quoting Bassidji v. Goe, 413 F.3d 928, 934 (9th Cir. 2005)).  And the DEI-1 Order begins by \n20  stating its purpose as enforcing “[l]ongstanding Federal civil-rights laws [that] protect individual \n21  Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”  DEI-1 \n22  Order § 1.  It then discusses how many institutions in recent years have adopted DEI activities \n23  “dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called \n24  ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) or ‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (DEIA) \n25  that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.”  Id.  The section ends with, “The Federal \n26  Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws.  The purpose of this order is to ensure \n27  that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.”  Id. \n28    Plaintiffs additionally argue that even if the Certification Provision is limited to promoting \n33 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 34 of 52\n \n1  “illegal DEI,” “it is bedrock First Amendment canon that advocating for violation of the law \n2  cannot be proscribed unless it rises to incitement.”  ECF No. 64 at 18 (citing Virginia v. Black, \n3  538 U.S. 343, 359 (2003)).  But Plaintiffs’ argument relies on a construction not supported by a \n4  plain reading of the Certification Provision.  The Certification Provision directs that every federal \n5  contract or grant award include a term “requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it \n6  does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-\n7  discrimination laws.”  DEI-2 Order § 3(b)(iv)(B).  The operative word, “violate,” modifies \n8  “programs”—rather than “promoting” or “DEI.”  In other words, the provision implicates the \n9  operation of programs that both promote DEI and “violate any applicable Federal anti-\n10  discrimination laws.”  And while the First Amendment may protect speech that advocates for \n11  violation of law, it does not protect activities that directly violate antidiscrimination law.  See \n12  R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 390 (1992) (“Where the government does not target \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  conduct on the basis of its expressive content, acts are not shielded from regulation merely \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  because they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy.”). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the merits for their First Amendment claim as to the Certification Provision. \nS d nr\nee 17  C.  Fifth Amendment Due Process \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its \n19  prohibitions are not clearly defined.”  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972); see \n20  also Williams, 553 U.S. at 304 (describing vagueness doctrine as “an outgrowth . . .  of the Due \n21  Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.”).  “[C]larity in regulation is essential to the protections \n22  provided by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, \n23  Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012) (citing United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008)).  The \n24  two primary concerns with vague laws are that “(1) they do not give a ‘person of ordinary \n25  intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly’; \n26  and (2) they encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by not providing explicit \n27  standards for policemen, judges, and juries.”  United States v. Jae Gab Kim, 449 F.3d 933, 941–42 \n28  (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108).  And vague laws that implicate First \n34 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 35 of 52\n \n1  Amendment rights “also have the “‘potential for arbitrarily suppressing First Amendment \n2  liberties.”’  Id. n.15 (quoting Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 91 (1965)).  \n3  The applicable void-for-vagueness standard thus depends in part on whether “a vague \n4  statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment Freedoms.”  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 109 \n5  (cleaned up).  “Under the First and Fifth Amendments, speakers are protected from arbitrary and \n6  discriminatory enforcement of vague standards.”  Finley, 524 U.S. at 588 (citing NAACP v. \n7  Button, 371 U.S. 415, 432–433 (1963)); see also Vill. of Hoffman Ests. v. Flipside, Hoffman Ests., \n8  Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982) (explaining that when a law “interferes with the right of free speech \n9  or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply”).   \n10  But “the degree of vagueness that the Constitution [allows] depends in part on the nature of \n11  the enactment.”  Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 156 (2018) (quoting Hoffman Estates, 455 \n12  U.S. at 498).  For example, the Supreme Court has “expressed greater tolerance of enactments \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  less severe.”  Id. at 156 (quoting Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 498–99).  And when the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  government awards “selective subsidies,” the tolerance for vagueness is even greater because “the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  consequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe.”  See Finley, 524 U.S. at 589. \nS d nr\nee 17  As a preliminary matter, Defendants argue that the void-for-vagueness doctrine does not \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  apply because the Challenged Orders do not regulate primary conduct, and no due process \n19  concerns arise “when the President gives his subordinates an unclear directive.”  See ECF No. 61 \n20  at 26.  Defendants cite no authority for that proposition.  Regardless, Defendants’ description of \n21  the Challenged Orders is incomplete, given that they expressly command action—and various \n22  agencies have already taken such action against Plaintiffs pursuant to the Challenged Orders.  The \n23  vagueness of the remaining Challenged Provisions thus implicates the traditional concerns under \n24  the vagueness doctrine, i.e., that they do not give fair notice so that grantees can act accordingly, \n25  and they encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by the implementing agencies.  See \n26  Kim, 449 F.3d at 941–42.  And in the context of Plaintiffs’ combined First Amendment arguments, \n27  the vague provisions also risk “arbitrarily suppressing First Amendment liberties.”  Shuttlesworth, \n28  382 U.S. at 91. \n35 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 36 of 52\n \n1    Defendants further contend that Plaintiffs’ facial vagueness challenges fail because “the \n2  appropriate posture for Due Process vagueness challenges is as-applied,” and that facial challenges \n3  are reserved for criminal laws or civil statutes involving severe penalties that implicate liberty \n4  interests.  ECF No. 61 at 26–27.  That statement of the law is incomplete:  “[i]n the First \n5  Amendment context, facial vagueness challenges are appropriate if the statute clearly implicates \n6  free speech rights.”  California Tchrs. Ass'n v. State Bd. of Educ., 271 F.3d 1141, 1149 (9th Cir. \n7  2001); see also Kashem v. Barr, 941 F.3d 358, 375 (9th Cir. 2019) (only “[v]agueness challenges \n8  to statutes that do not involve First Amendment violations must be examined as applied to the \n9  defendant”) (quoting United States v. Kim, 449 F.3d 933, 942 (9th Cir. 2006)); Maynard v. \n10  Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 361 (1988) (“Vagueness challenges to statutes not threatening First \n11  Amendment interests are examined in light of the facts of the case at hand.”); Isaacson v. Mayes, \n12  84 F.4th 1089, 1098–99 (9th Cir. 2023) (rejecting “district court’s suggestion that . . . vagueness \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  challenges, cannot be reviewed before enforcement” because the court must “decide whether the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  harm is sufficiently likely so that the litigant need not wait until the harm occurs”)   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Because Plaintiffs raise combined Fifth and First Amendment challenges, there is no \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  categorical bar preventing Plaintiffs from raising a facial challenge to the vagueness of the \nS d nr\nee 17  remaining Challenged Provisions.  Moreover, Plaintiffs bring both facial and as-applied \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  challenges.  See ECF No. 64 at 21–22. \n19  1.  Equity Termination Provision \n20  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the \n21  Equity Termination Provision is impermissibly vague under the Fifth Amendment.  The Equity \n22  Termination Provision directs the head of each agency to “terminate, to the maximum extent \n23  allowed by law, all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts.”  DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(i).  The \n24  vagueness of the term ‘“equity-related’ grants or contracts” invites arbitrary and discriminatory \n25  enforcement and does not provide sufficient notice to grantees as to what types of speech or \n26  activity they must avoid to prevent termination of their grants or contracts—compelling grantees \n27  and grant applicants to “steer far too clear of [the] ‘forbidden area’” of anything related to the \n28  broad and undefined term of “equity.”  Cf. Finley, 524 U.S. at 588.   \n36 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 37 of 52\n \n1  The Supreme Court case National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley provides a useful \n2  counterpoint.  In Finley, the plaintiff raised a facial challenge under the First and Fifth \n3  Amendments to language in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act.  See 524 \n4  U.S. at 569.  The Act provided that the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts, in \n5  establishing procedures to judge the artistic merit of grant applications, shall ensure that “artistic \n6  excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged, taking into \n7  consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the \n8  American public.”  Id. at 572 (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 954(d)(1)).  The plaintiff challenged the \n9  portion of the Act directing the grantor to “tak[e] into consideration general standards of decency \n10  and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public.”  Id. (quoting 20 U.S.C. § \n11  954(d)(1)).  Because the challenged statute in Finley dealt with the “competitive process according \n12  to which [art] grants [were] allocated,” id. at 586, wherein grantees would be selected based on \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  “artistic excellence and artistic merit,” the Supreme Court reasoned that the challenged language \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “merely adds some imprecise considerations to an already subjective selection process,” id. at 590.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The Supreme Court thus ultimately held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  while “[t]he terms of the provision are undeniably opaque,” it was unlikely “that speakers will be \nS d nr\nee 17  compelled to steer too far clear of any ‘forbidden area’ in the context of grants of this nature.”  Id. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  at 588–89. \n19  Here, the Court finds that the Equity Termination Provision is likely to compel speakers to \n20  “steer too far clear of [a] ‘forbidden area’” of protected speech and activity.  Finley, 524 U.S. at \n21  588.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine an Executive Order vaguer in its command (providing that \n22  agencies shall terminate any grant or contract for being “equity-related”) or broader in its facial \n23  scope (applying to all federal grants and contracts). \n24  First, whereas the vague language in Finley was only another factor to be considered in an \n25  inherently subjective evaluation alongside “artistic excellence and artistic merit,” the Equity \n26  Termination Provision renders categorically ineligible for funding any contract or grant based on \n27  the single determination of whether it is “equity-related” without any guidelines as to what that \n28  term may mean.  See Finley, 524 U.S. at 581, 583–84 (noting that the challenged text “imposes no \n37 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 38 of 52\n \n1  categorical requirement” and instead operates as “advisory language” with “the vague \n2  exhortation to ‘take [decency] into consideration’”).  The Equity Termination Provision is vague \n3  here not because “it may at times be difficult to prove an incriminating fact but rather because it is \n4  unclear as to what fact must be proved.”  See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, \n5  253 (2012).  Indeed, the DEI-1 Order does not define what “equity” or “equity-related” means at \n6  all.  And the government has avoided offering any concrete definition of the term—taking the \n7  position at hearing that it need not put forward any definition.  This lack of definition is \n8  particularly problematic given the broad nature and applications of the term “equity,” let alone \n9  with the additional modifier of “-related.”  “Equity,” could mean (1) “fairness or justice in the way \n10  people are treated;” (2) “freedom from disparities in the way people of different races, genders, \n11  etc. are treated;” or (3) “something that is equitable.”  Equity, Merriam-Webster.com, \n12  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equity (last visited May 7, 2025).  To give just one \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  example, surely many federal grants expressly fund programs about fairness.  But the Equity \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Termination Provision could reasonably cover any grantee activity or speech about fairness in the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  treatment of others, as well as that acknowledging the import or mere existence of gender, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  inequality, race, age, disability, sexuality, socioeconomic status, religion, or citizenship.   \nS de nre 17  “[T]his lack of clarity may operate to inhibit the exercise of freedom of expression because \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  individuals will not know whether the ordinance allows their conduct, and may choose not to \n19  exercise their rights for fear of being . . . punished.”  Hunt v. City of Los Angeles, 638 F.3d 703, \n713 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372–73 (1964) (finding that the \n20 \nchallenged statute was unconstitutionally vague because it required individuals to take vague oaths \n21 \nthat would require the oath-taker to “steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of \n22 \nthe forbidden areas were clearly marked”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, the \n23 \nuncertainty created by the Equity Termination Provision has left grantees to interpret for \n24 \nthemselves which of their awarded grants even fall under the scope of the provision.  See ECF No. \n25 \n47-7 ¶ 35; see also id., Ex. A; ECF No. 47-8, Ex. A; ECF No. 47-10, Ex. A; ECF No. 77-4, Ex. D.  \n26 \nBut even after undertaking these efforts, the vagueness of the Equity Termination Provision \n27 \nprevents grantees from determining how they can modify their expression to avoid termination or \n28 \n38 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 39 of 52\n \n1  from even assessing which grants are implicated.  Could a Plaintiff’s very organizational name, if \n2  it attempts to promote the inclusion of certain identities, (such as the Gay Lesbian Bisexual \n3  Transgender Historical Society) trigger the Equity Termination Provision as “equity-related” and \ncause all their federal grants or contracts to be terminated?  Plaintiffs and similar organizations are \n4 \nleft to wonder.    \n5 \nSecond, the Equity Termination Provision applies with maximum scope—terminating \n6 \nfunding for all federal grants and contracts, including future awards and those that already have \n7 \nbeen awarded.  Whereas Finley dealt with a statute whose “mandate is to make esthetic \n8 \njudgments” and which involved an “inherently content-based ‘excellence’ threshold,” Finley, 524 \n9 \nU.S. at 586, the Equity Termination Provision risks chilling First Amendment speech and activity \n10 \nacross all federal grants and contracts regardless of the statutory mandates from which they arise.  \n11 \nSee id. at 569, 589–90 (noting that while the challenged language of the Act may cause artists to \n12 \n \na\ntruo inro 13  “conform their speech to what they believe to be the decisionmaking criteria in order to acquire \nCfi\n tla funding,” this was common in “the context of selective subsidies” where government programs \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  award scholarships and grants on the basis of subjective criteria such as “excellence”).  As \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  discussed in the Court’s First Amendment analysis, the Equity Termination Provision’s broad \nS d nr sweep—applying uniformly with no regard to the objectives of any individual grant or contract—\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo makes its intrusion upon First Amendment rights particularly pernicious and likely to chill a \nN 18 \n“substantial amount of protected speech” relative to its legitimate purposes.  See United States v. \n19 \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473–481 (2010).  In other words, the vague categorically prohibition set \n20 \nout in the Equity Termination Provision creates an enormous “forbidden area” of speech (across \n21 \nall federally funded grants or contracts) that grantees must steer clear of—all without any guidance \n22 \nas to how they can do so.  \n23 \n  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Fifth \n24 \nAmendment vagueness challenge—both facial and as-applied—to the Equity Termination \n25 \nProvision.  See Santa Cruz Lesbian & Gay Cmty. Ctr. v. Trump, 508 F. Supp. 3d 521, 543–44 \n26 \n(N.D. Cal. 2020) (finding that an Executive Order provision conditioning federal funds on the \n27 \n“recipient’s certification that it will not use federal funds to ‘promote’ [divisive concepts, \n28 \n39 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 40 of 52\n \n1  including] . . . that “an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or \n2  oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously” because the provision was “so vague that it is \n3  impossible for Plaintiffs to determine what conduct is prohibited”). \n4  2.  Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision \n5  The Gender Termination Provision provides that agencies “shall take all necessary steps, \n6  as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.”  Gender Order § 3(e).  \n7  Similarly, the Gender Promotion Provision states, “Federal funds shall not be used to promote \n8  gender ideology.  Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure \n9  grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”  Gender Order § 3(g).  Critically, unlike the Equity \n10  Termination Provision, the Gender Order provides a definition of the key phrase “gender \n11  ideology.”  “Gender ideology” is defined in the order as “replac[ing] the biological category of sex \n12  with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  can identify as and thus become women and vice versa,” and “includ[ing] the idea that there is a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex.”  Gender Order § 2(f).   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15   A plain reading of these provisions thus suggests that they are aimed at prohibiting federal \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  funding used to “promote” ideas of “self-assessed gender identity,” i.e., that “there is a vast \nS d nr\nee 17  spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex.”  At hearing, Plaintiffs contended that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the term “promote” makes the provisions unconstitutionally vague because it does not sufficiently \n19  explain which activities would constitute “promoting gender ideology”—for example, referring to \n20  their transgender patients by their pronouns, asking patients for their gender identities, or even \n21  generally providing services to transgender people at all.  But the Gender Order as a whole offers \n22  greater determinacy to what the plain term “promote” means in the context of the two challenged \n23  provisions.  To be specific, the Gender Order stands in opposition to the principle that persons can \n24  identify as other than strictly male or female, or that persons may have a gender identity different \n25  from their biological sex as classified at birth.  Plaintiffs appear to attach this same meaning to the \n26  Gender Termination Provision and the Gender Promotion Provision.  In their reply brief, they \n27  write:   \n \n28  The Gender Order requires agencies to “ensure grant funds do not \n40 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 41 of 52\n \npromote gender ideology” and “to end the Federal funding of \n1  gender ideology,” which it defines as the recognition that a person \nmay have a gender identity that differs from their birth sex. Gender \n2  Order §§ 2(f), 3(e), (g) (emphasis added). At their core, the Gender \nOrder and its implementing agency actions seek to prohibit \n3  transgender people from accessing federally funded healthcare and \nsocial services if such services are provided in a way that \n4  acknowledges and respects their identities. \n5  ECF No. 64 at 25.12  Plaintiffs thus appear to be able to construe the general application of the \n6  term “promote gender ideology.”  And “the mere fact that close cases can be envisioned [does not] \n7  render[] a statute vague.”  United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 305 (2008).  The Court thus \n8  finds that the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision are not so vague \n9  that their “prohibitions are not clearly defined.”  See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.  Accordingly, \n10  Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits on their Fifth Amendment \n11  challenge as to the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision. \n12  3.  Certification Provision \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ vagueness challenge to the Certification Provision fails \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  because the provision applies only to conduct that violates existing federal antidiscrimination law \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and does not penalize any new conduct, so Plaintiffs “have no legitimate concern that they will not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  be given a ‘“reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.”’  ECF No. 61 at 30 (quoting \nS d nr\nee 17  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108).  Plaintiffs primarily make the same arguments as in their First \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Amendment challenge to the Certification Provision—arguing that an “ordinary person has no \n19  way of knowing whether their expression relating to DEI satisfies Defendants’ conception of \n20  ‘legal’ DEI where Defendants refuse to explain the distinction between ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ DEI.”  \n21  ECF No. 64 at 23.   \n22  For the reasons discussed above, the Court does not now find that the Certification \n23  Provision implicates DEI activities beyond those described in its express text, i.e., DEI programs \n24  that “violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination law.”  While the term “DEI” is undefined \n25  and vague, the limiting qualifier implicating only DEI programs that “violate any applicable \n26  Federal anti-discrimination law” is sufficiently defined because it incorporates by reference the \n27 \n \n28 \n12 Defendants do not attempt to define these terms in their opposition brief.   \n41 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 42 of 52\n \n1  body of existing federal law.  As another court examining the Certification Provision has noted, \n2  “[i]f Plaintiffs worry that this administration takes a broader view of what counts as illegal \n3  discrimination, that is a concern with the interpretation of the underlying federal \n4  antidiscrimination law—which Plaintiffs do not challenge—rather than the Certification \n5  Provision. . . . Plaintiffs may contest whether their DEI programs fall within the scope of that law \n6  if they ever face an enforcement action connected to the Certification Provision.”  Nat’l Urb. \n7  League v. Trump, 2025 WL 1275613, at *24; see also Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher \n8  Educ. v. Trump, No. 25-1189, ECF No. 29 at 7 (4th Cir. Mar. 14, 2025) (Harris, J., concurring) \n9  (finding that the Certification Provision does not “purport to establish the illegality of all efforts to \n10  advance [DEI],” and instead applies “only to conduct that violates existing federal anti-\n11  discrimination law”); but see CWIT II, 2025 WL 1114466, at *11 (finding that the Certification \n12  Provision’s limitation to only “illegal DEI programs” was “left entirely to the grantee’s \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  imagination” because the government did not provide any meaningful definition as to what it \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  meant for a DEI program to violate federal anti-discrimination law).  Without clearer evidence that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the Executive intends to enforce the Certification Provision to target all legal DEI activity, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs’ challenge is more appropriately considered in a post-enforcement posture. \nS d nr\nee 17  Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their claim that the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Gender Termination Provision, Gender Promotion Provision, and Certification Provision are \n19  unconstitutionally vague, the Court need not address arguments regarding whether Plaintiffs hold \n20  an underlying property right to their grants or liberty interest in their reputations.  See CWIT II, \n21  2025 WL 1114466, at *16. \n22  D.  Separation of Powers \n23  Plaintiffs assert both facial and as-applied challenges under the Separation of Powers \n24  against the remaining Challenged Provisions.  Plaintiffs argue that the Challenged Provisions \n25  “improperly usurp Congress’s spending power by directing that grants or contracts authorized by \n26  Congress be cancelled based on conditions not set by Congress.”  ECF No. 64 at 29.  Defendants \n27  respond that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the requirement under a facial challenge that the Challenged \n28  Provisions are unconstitutional in all of their applications. ECF No. 61 at 39–40.   \n42 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 43 of 52\n \n1  “The President’s authority to act ‘must stem either from an act of Congress or from the \n2  Constitution itself.’”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952).  \n3  “[W]hen it comes to spending, the President has none of ‘his own constitutional powers’ to ‘rely’ \n4  upon.”  City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1233–34 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting \n5  id. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring)).  Instead, the President has an affirmative obligation to enforce \n6  the law relating to appropriations.  Id. at 1234.  “Absent congressional authorization, the \n7  Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate \n8  its own policy goals.”  Id. at 1235.  “To bring a successful facial challenge outside the context of \n9  the First Amendment, ‘the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under \n10  which the [challenged law] would be valid.’”  Hotel & Motel Ass’n of Oakland v. City of Oakland, \n11  344 F.3d 959, 971 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).   \n12  1.  Facial Challenge \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that the remaining \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Challenged Provisions violate Separation-of-Powers principles in all of their applications.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Defendants correctly identify at least two circumstances implicated by the Challenged Provisions \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  where the Executive has discretion to act without seeking Congressional approval.  First, the \nS d nr\nee 17  Challenged Provisions apply to both federal grants and contracts.  And the Executive has “broad” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  discretion to “terminate a contract for convenience.”  Northrop Grumman Corp. v. United States, \n19  46 Fed. Cl. 622, 626 (2000) (citation omitted).  Second, at least some of the federal grants \n20  implicated here may, under the terms of the applicable regulations, be terminated by the Executive \n21  if the grant “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”   See, e.g., ECF \n22  No. 58-3 (quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2)).  Each of the remaining Challenged Provisions thus \n23  involve at least some contracts and grants that can properly be terminated without violating the \n24  Spending Clause.  See Chicago Women in Trades v. Trump, No. 25 C 2005, 2025 WL 1114466, at \n25  *16–17 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2025) (finding that because the Equity Termination Provision impacts \n26  grant statutes “that do not require the government to fund equity-related projects, . . . there are \n27  situations in which the Executive Branch could lawfully terminate such grants without running \n28  afoul of the separation of powers”).   \n43 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 44 of 52\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ reliance on City and County of San Francisco v. Trump, does not warrant a \n2  different result.  There, the Ninth Circuit found that an executive order directing the Attorney \n3  General and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to make “sanctuary jurisdictions” \n4  ineligible to receive federal grants violated the Spending Clause and Separation of Powers.  Id., \n5  897 F.3d at 1235.  But that case involved grants that were specifically appropriated for the plaintiff \n6  jurisdictions.  And “to condition the States’ receipt of federal funds, [Congress] ‘must do so \n7  unambiguously . . . , enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the \n8  consequences of their participation,” due to federalism principles.  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n9  203, 207 (1987).  Whereas here, the grants received by Plaintiffs were appropriated by Congress \n10  for more general purposes and to be allocated by the implementing agencies, including with terms \n11  (as discussed above) that give the Executive discretion to terminate at least in some instances.  \n12  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that they are likely to succeed in their \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  facial Separation of Powers challenge. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2.  As-Applied Challenge/Conflict with Statutory Requirements  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs’ as-applied Separation of Powers challenge essentially collapses with their claim \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that the Equity Termination Provision, Gender Termination Provision, and Gender Promotion \nS d nr\nee 17  Provision are ultra vires because they are contrary to the statutes identified by Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  argue that the Equity Termination Provision conflicts with the following funding statutes under \n19  which Plaintiffs receive funding: (1) Ryan White Program; (2) the Housing Opportunities for \n20  People with AIDS (“HOPWA”) program; and (3) the statutory framework governing Federally \n21  Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”).  The Court agrees. \n22    First, the Ryan White Program provides that for the purpose of “address[ing] the \n23  disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on, and the disparities in access, treatment, care, and \n24  outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities,” there are specifically appropriated funds for which the \n25  Secretary “shall develop a formula for the awarding of grants . . . that ensures that funding is \n26  provided based on the distribution of populations disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS.”  42 \n27  U.S. Code § 300ff-121(a) (emphases added).  By directing the termination of all ‘“equity-related’ \n28  grants or contracts,” the Equity Termination Provision runs headlong into the Ryan White \n44 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 45 of 52\n \n1  Program’s statutory mandate—as a distribution of funds to populations based on how they were \n2  disproportionately impacted is a classic example of “equitable” distribution.  See CWIT II, 2025 \n3  WL 1114466, at *17–18 (finding that the Equity Termination Provision likely violated the \n4  separation of powers when applied to plaintiff’s grant under the Women in Apprenticeship and \n5  Nontraditional Occupations Act, in which Congress explicitly stated that the Executive ‘“shall’ \n6  award grants for projects impacting women (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2503(a) (emphasis in original))). \n7    Second, under the subsection entitled “[a]ffirmative outreach,” HOPWA regulations \n8  provide that a “grantee or project sponsor must adopt procedures to ensure that all persons who \n9  qualify for the assistance, regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, familial \n10  status, or handicap, know of the availability of the HOPWA program.” 24 C.F.R. § 574.603(b).  \n11  While HOPWA’s requirement here could lead to a grantee adopting procedures in such a way that \n12  prioritizes outreach based on equitable principles, it is not clear to the Court that a grantee must \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  adopt procedures in exactly that fashion to satisfy HOPWA’s regulations.  However, because \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defendants do not respond to this specific argument, they have waived it and conceded the point.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  See Tyler, 499 F. Supp. 3d at 701. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Third, the statutory framework for FQHCs, which applies to Plaintiffs SFCHC and LA \nS d nr\nee 17  LGBT Center, mandates them as receivers of federal funding to provide medical care to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “medically underserved populations” and specific minority groups facing systemic barriers to \n19  healthcare access.  See 42 U.S.C. § 254b(a)(1).  Furthermore, Congress has directly appropriated \n20  funds for providing healthcare services to specific minority populations under the FQHC \n21  program—a core “equity-related” purpose.  See 42 U.S.C. § 254c-1 (providing that the HHS \n22  Secretary “shall provide grants to, or enter into contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies \n23  that have demonstrated experience in serving the health needs of Pacific Islanders living in the \n24  Territory of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of \n25  Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and the Federated States of \n26  Micronesia” and that such grants “shall be used, among other items . . . to continue, as a priority, \n27  the medical officer training program in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia”); see also 42 \n28  U.S.C. § 254c-3 (providing that the HHS Secretary “shall make grants for providing services for \n45 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 46 of 52\n \n1  the prevention and treatment of diabetes” through the Indian Health Service, an Indian health \n2  program operated by an Indian tribe or tribal organization, or an urban Indian health program \n3  operated by an urban Indian organization).  The Equity Termination Provision thus also conflicts \n4  with the statutory framework providing federal funding to FQHCs. \n5  Plaintiffs further argue that because the Gender Order’s termination provisions facially \n6  discriminate based on transgender status—and thus sex—they violate the antidiscrimination \n7  requirements contained within the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. § 18116, and the \n8  Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), 42 U.S.C. § 300w-7.  Section 1557 of the ACA provides \n9  that an individual shall not, among other things, “be excluded [on the basis of sex under Title IX, \n10  20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.] from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n11  discrimination under, any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving Federal \n12  financial assistance.”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  Section 1908 of the PHSA similarly prohibits \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  discrimination on the basis of sex in programs, services, and activities “receiving Federal financial \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  assistance” through Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grants, which are allotted by the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  HHS Secretary. See 42 U.S.C. § 300w-7.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  For the reasons explained in the Court’s discussion on Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, \nS d nr\nee 17  the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision contravene the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  antidiscrimination requirements within the ACA and PHSA.  See Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 \n19  U.S. 644, 660 (2020) (holding in the context of Title VII that “it is impossible to discriminate \n20  against a person for being . . . transgender without discriminating against that individual based on \n21  sex”); see also Doe v. Snyder, 28 F.4th 103, 114 (9th Cir. 2022) (“We construe Title IX’s \n22  protections consistently with those of Title VII.”); PFLAG II, 2025 WL 510050, at *18 (finding \n23  that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on its claim that the Gender Promotion Provision was ultra \n24  vires as contrary to statutes because it was “facially discriminatory on the basis of transgender \n25  identity” and therefore on the basis of sex and thus violated Section 1557 of the ACA and Section \n26  1908 of the PHSA); C.P. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ill., No. 3:20-CV-06145-RJB, 2022 WL \n27  17788148, at *6 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 19, 2022) (“Section 1557 [of the ACA] forbids sex \n28  discrimination based on transgender status.”).  \n46 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 47 of 52\n \n1  Defendants do not explicitly argue that the Funding Provisions do not conflict with the \n2  statutory frameworks identified above but rather that they “do not unequivocally compel agencies \n3  to improperly withhold congressionally appropriated funds” and instead only “provide general \n4  directives to agencies to align government funding with policy priorities while explicitly directing \n5  them to yield to any and all applicable laws before terminating any grant/contact.”  ECF No. 61 at \n6  40–41.  So, Defendants argue, the qualifiers “to the maximum extent allowed by law” in the \n7  Equity Termination Provision and “as permitted by law” in the Gender Termination Provision \n8  operate as applicable savings clauses.  Essentially, Defendants argue that if Plaintiffs are correct \n9  that an applicable statute bars the termination of their grants, then the Equity Termination \n10  Provision “would instruct agencies to yield to the statutory and regulatory mandates and refrain \n11  from terminating those grants.”  ECF No. 61 at 42.  In making this argument, Defendants rely \n12  heavily on the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-\n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  CIO v. Allbaugh, 295 F.3d 28 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  In Allbaugh, the D.C. Circuit considered an executive order which barred any federal \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  agency, “to the extent permitted by law,” from requiring or prohibiting contractors or bidders from \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  entering into a labor agreement.  Id. at 29.  The D.C. Circuit found that because the executive \nS d nr\nee 17  order limited agencies’ power “to the extent permitted by law,” the order did not infringe on \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Congress’s spending power, as it only “instruct[ed] . . . agenc[ies] to follow the law.”  Id. at 33.  \n19  The court concluded that “[t]he mere possibility that some agency might make a legally suspect \n20  decision . . . does not justify an injunction against enforcement of a policy.”  Id. \n21    However, the Ninth Circuit has distinguished the application of Allbaugh in a case more \n22  similar to the one at hand.  In City and County of San Francisco v. Trump, the Ninth Circuit found \n23  that the executive order directing the Attorney General and Secretary of the Department of \n24  Homeland Security to make “sanctuary jurisdictions” ineligible to receive federal grants “to the \n25  extent consistent with law” “unambiguously command[ed] action” and hence created more than a \n26  “mere possibility that some agency might make a legally suspect decision.”  897 F.3d at 1240 \n27  (quoting Allbaugh, 295 F.3d at 33).  The court thus distinguished Allbaugh and found that the \n28  order’s savings clause “does not and cannot override [the executive order’s] meaning.”  Id.  “If \n47 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 48 of 52\n \n1  ‘consistent with law’ precludes a court from examining whether the Executive Order is consistent \n2  with law,” the court explained, “judicial review [would be] a meaningless exercise, precluding \n3  resolution of the critical legal issues” and leading the court into “an intellectual cul-de-sac.”  Id. \n4    Here, as in City and County of San Francisco, the Equity Termination Provision, Gender \n5  Termination Provision, and Gender Promotion Provision all “unambiguously command[] action,” \n6  see id. at 1240, by expressly requiring agencies and departments to terminate all “‘equity-related’ \n7  grants or contracts,” “end the Federal funding of gender ideology,” and “ensure grant funds do not \n8  promote gender ideology.”  See DEI-1 Order § 2(b)(i); Gender Order § 3(e); Gender Order § 3(g).  \n9  Indeed, agencies have already begun terminating grants or contracts pursuant to these \n10  provisions—even though such terminations conflict with the statutory requirements cited above.  \n11  See, e.g., ECF No. 47-10, Ex. C; ECF No. 57 ¶¶ 5–16; ECF No. 77 ¶¶ 3–11.  The Court thus \n12  rejects Defendants’ argument that the provisions here merely provide general directives to \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  agencies and direct them to yield to all applicable laws before terminating any grant or contract.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  See PFLAG II, 2025 WL 685124, at *18 (finding that the Gender Promotion Provision’s savings \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  clause did not override its plain meaning and stated purpose of “unlawfully restrict[ing] federal \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  funding without congressional authorization”) (citing HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 325 (4th \nS d nr\nee 17  Cir. 2021) and City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1240); see also CWIT II, 2025 WL \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  1114466, at *17–18 (finding that the Equity Termination Provision’s savings clause did not \n19  immunize the provision from contravening the WANTO Act’s prescriptions). \n20    Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on \n21  their claim that the Equity Termination Provision violates the Separation of Powers as applied to \n22  the grants Plaintiffs receive under the Ryan White Program, under the HOPWA program, and as \n23  FQHCs.  And Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claim that the Gender \n24  Termination Provision and Gender Promotion Provision violate the Separation of Powers by \n25  contravening the antidiscrimination provisions of the ACA and PHSA. \n26  V.  IRREPARABLE HARM \n27  As the Court found in its analysis on the merits, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the \n28  Gender Promotion, Gender Termination, and Equity Termination Provisions likely violate the \n48 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 49 of 52\n \n1  equal protection rights of Plaintiffs and their clients as well as Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights \n2  under the First and Fifth Amendments.   \n3  That means that Plaintiffs have also made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm that \n4  would result from enforcement of those provisions, as it is “well established that the deprivation of \n5  constitutional rights ‘unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 \n6  F.3d 976, 994 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012)).  \n7  This is particularly true when the First Amendment is implicated, because the “loss of First \n8  Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \n9  injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, \n10  403 U.S. 713 (1971)).   \n11  Furthermore, enforcement of the Gender Termination Provision and Gender Promotion \n12  Provision prevents Plaintiffs from being able to effectively serve their transgender patients and \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  clients.  Without an injunction against those provisions, Plaintiffs’ patients and clients will suffer \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  irreparable harm in being deprived vital healthcare services.  See Washington, 2025 WL 659057, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  at *26 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  VI.  BALANCE OF THE HARMS AND PUBLIC INTEREST \nS d nr\nee 17  “Where the government is a party to a case in which a preliminary injunction is sought, the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  balance of the equities and public interest factors merge.”  Roman v. Wolf, 977 F.3d 935, 940–41 \n19  (9th Cir. 2020).  To begin, the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized that “it is always in the \n20  public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”  Melendres, 695 F.3d at \n21  1002 (internal quotations omitted).  Furthermore, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have established \n22  specific operational harms that they have suffered and will continue to suffer absent an injunction.  \n23  Defendants mainly argue that granting an injunction here would disable the Executive from being \n24  able to implement the President’s priorities and chill agency action because agencies “may feel \n25  obligated to forgo pursuing legally permissible actions in furtherance of the President’s policy \n26  priorities—independent of the Executive Orders—for fear of risking contempt.”  ECF No. 61 at \n27  46. \n28  The Court finds that the balance of harms and public interest weigh in favor of issuing an \n49 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 50 of 52\n \n1  injunction.  The injunction requested here would not prevent the Executive from taking any \n2  number of lawful actions to implement the President’s priorities, including promulgating \n3  regulations, proposing legislation, or taking litigation positions.  The problem here is that three of \n4  the Challenged Provisions attempt to implement those priorities in ways that are inconsistent with \n5  the Constitution and existing statutes.  Defendants thus do not suffer harm from being unable to \n6  enforce those unlawful provisions.  And any potential “chill” on agency action is speculative at \n7  this stage and does not outweigh the strong public interest in upholding the rule of law and \n8  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  See Washington, 2025 WL 509617, at *14; see also PFLAG II, \n9  2025 WL 510050, at *23. \n10  VII.  SCOPE OF INJUNCTION \n11  Plaintiffs request a preliminary injunction enjoining the Agency Defendants13 from \n12  enforcing the Challenged Provisions against them.  The Court thus grants a preliminary injunction \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  barring Agency Defendants from enforcing the Gender Termination Provision, Gender Promotion \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Provision, and Equity Termination Provision against Plaintiffs. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Separately, the Court rejects Defendants’ request that the Court “clarify that it does not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  prohibit the President from reissuing a different directive or Executive Order and does not limit \nS d nr\nee 17  the defendant agencies from taking actions pursuant to their legal authority to regulate in \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  furtherance of the substantive policy priorities in the Executive Orders,” ECF No. 61 at 48, \n19  because those questions are not properly before the Court.   \n20  VIII.  BOND  \n21  Rule 65(c) provides that the Court “may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary \n22  restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to \n23  pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \n24  restrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. P 65(c).  But “[d]espite the seemingly mandatory language, ‘Rule 65(c) \n25 \n \n26 \n13 Defendants DOJ; Attorney General Pamela Bondi; DOL; Acting Labor Secretary Vince \nMicone; OFCCP; Acting OFCCP Director Michael Schloss; OMB; OMB Director Russell \n27 \nVought; HHS; HHS Secretary Robert K. Kennedy, Jr.; HUD; HUD Secretary Scott Turner; \nNARA; Deputy Archivist William J. Bosanko; NEH; and NEH Chair Shelly C. Lowe. \n28 \n \n50 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 51 of 52\n \n1  invests the district court ‘with discretion as to the amount of security required, if any.’”  \n2  Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 \n3  F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003)) (emphasis in original).  The District Court thus “may dispense with \n4  the filing of a bond when it concludes there is no realistic likelihood of harm to the defendant from \n5  enjoining his or her conduct.” Id. (quoting Jorgensen, 320 F.3d at 919).  Here, because the Court \n6  finds Plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their claims as to the three enjoined provisions, \n7  the Court does not find that a preliminary injunction is likely to pose any harm to Defendants by \n8  preventing them from enforcing those unlawful provisions.  Furthermore, waiving bond is \n9  particularly appropriate here where Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations suing in large part \n10  because they are suffering monetary harm from the unlawful provisions of the Challenged Orders \n11  that have withheld federal funding critical to their everyday operations.  See Miller v. Carlson, 768 \n12  F. Supp. 1331, 1340 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (explaining that courts have waived bond to avoid denying \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  access to judicial review). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The Court therefore orders Plaintiffs to post a nominal bond in the amount of $1,000.00.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  See Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, 167 F.3d 1228, 1237 (9th Cir. 1999), supplemented, 236 F.3d 1115 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (9th Cir. 2001).   \nS d nr\nee 17  IX.  REQUEST FOR STAY \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants request that the Court stay its preliminary injunction pending the disposition of \n19  any appeal filed, or in the alternative, administratively stay the injunction “for a period of seven \n20  days to allow the United States to seek an emergency, expedited stay from the court of appeals if \n21  an appeal is authorized.”  See ECF No. 61 at 48–49. \n22  As a threshold matter, Defendants’ request is procedurally improper. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23  7(b)(1) (“A request for a court order must be made by motion.”).  But regardless, as the Court has \n24  found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits relating to the three enjoined provisions, \n25  the Court denies Defendants’ request for a stay.  See Manrique v. Kolc, 65 F.4th 1037, 1040 (9th \n26  Cir. 2023) (providing that one of the primary factors considered for whether a stay should be \n27  issued is whether the applicant for the stay has “made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed \n28  on the merits” (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009))); see also Washington v. \n51 \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 81     Filed 06/09/25     Page 52 of 52\n \n1  Trump, No. 25-807, 2025 WL 553485, at *3 (9th Cir. Feb. 19, 2025).  Moreover, Defendants have \n2  not carried their burden of showing that they are likely to face “irreparable injury . . . during the \n3  period before the appeal is decided.”  See Doe #1 v. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1058–59 (9th Cir. \n4  2020). \n5    Similarly, the Court denies Defendants’ request for an administrative stay.  The purpose of \n6  an administrative stay is to “preserve the status quo until the substantive motion for a stay pending \n7  appeal can be considered on the merits.”  See Nat’l Urban League v. Ross, 977 F.3d 698, 700–01 \n8  (9th Cir. 2020).  Because the Court has found that a preliminary injunction is necessary precisely \n9  to alter the status quo and address the irreparable harm that Plaintiffs face absent an injunction, an \n10  administrative stay is not appropriate here.   \n11  CONCLUSION \n12    The Court grants, in part, Plaintiffs’ motion for a  preliminary injunction consistent with \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the discussion in this Order.  The Court will enter a separate preliminary injunction order.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs are directed to file a proposed preliminary injunction order, and submit a Word version \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the same to the to the Court’s proposed order email address, by June 13, 2025. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nS d nr\nee 17  Dated:  June 9, 2025 \nth\ninUtro ______________________________________ \nN 18 \nJON S.

I am the Chief Executive Officer of the Los Angeles LGBT Center (“LA LGBT \n3 Center”), a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in Los Angeles, California, that provides a \n4 variety of services to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (“LGBTQ”) \n5 communities. I have served in this capacity since 2022. I joined the staff of the LA LGBT Center \n6 in 2021. \n7 2.  On February 25, 2025, I executed a Declaration (ECF No. 47-5) in support of \n8 Plaintiffs’ Complaint and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, filed on March 3, 2025 (ECF No. \n9 47) to prevent Defendant agencies and their leadership from enforcing Executive Order No. 14168 \n10 “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the \n11 Federal Government” (“Gender Order”), issued January 20, 2025; Executive Order No. 14151 \n12 “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing” (“DEI-1 Order”), issued January \n13 20, 2025; and Executive Order No. 14173 “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-\n14 Based Opportunity” (“DEI-2 Order”), issued January 21, 2025 (collectively, the “Executive \n15 Orders”), and related agency directives.  \n16 3.  Since executing that Declaration on February 25, 2025, I learned that Defendant \n17 National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) has terminated a federal grant awarded to the University of \n18 California, Los Angeles (“UCLA”) under which the LA LGBT Center is a subawardee. I also \n19 learned that LA LGBT Center has been advised by an Federal agency employee that it must remove \n20 certain  words  or  acronyms,  including  “LGBT,”  “queer,”  “transgender,”  etc.  from  any  new \n21 materials created in connection with our Intimate Partner Violence Training Program or the \n22 funding received for that program, pursuant to a $1.5 million grant from the Office of Family \n23 Violence and Prevention Services (“OFVPS”), is likely to be terminated.  \n24 4.  I am submitting this supplemental declaration to inform the Court of these recent \n25 developments and the negative impacts they have had and will continue to have on LA LGBT \n26 Center and the people that it serves.  \n27\n2 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF JOE HOLLENDONER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 57     Filed 04/07/25     Page 3 of 8\n \n \n1 A.  NIH Grant Terminations \n2 Race & Place Grant \n3 5.  Upon information and belief, on or about September 5, 2024, UCLA won a grant \n4 from NIH (the “NIH Grant”) to study the intersection of race and substance use and HIV outcomes \n5 in Los Angeles County under the project title: “Race & Place: The Impacts of Racial Inequality on \n6 Substance Use and HIV Outcomes in Los Angeles” (the “Race & Place Study”). The NIH Grant \n7 was for the period September 15, 2024 through July 31, 2029.  \n8 6.  The Notice of Award for the NIH Grant is attached as Exhibit A.  \n9 7.  Based on findings in prior related studies, the population of substance using men \n10 who have sex with men (“MSM”) of color who are living with HIV are among the most \n11 marginalized, underserved, and stigmatized members of the LGBTQ community. As a result, these \n12 individuals suffer from high rates of homeliness, food insecurity, unemployment, lack of access to \n13 medical and mental health care, and lack of access to substance us recovery services, among other \n14 basic needs. The Race & Place Study, therefore, is intended to identify and address factors \n15 contributing to racial inequities in HIV care. Through comprehensive research and analysis, the \n16 study seeks to develop and implement improved healthcare delivery models aimed at enhancing \n17 racial equity and reducing disparities in HIV treatment and outcomes. The findings from this study \n18 are intended to inform public health strategies and policies, ultimately contributing to more \n19 equitable healthcare systems and improved health outcomes for racially diverse populations \n20 affected by HIV.  \n21 8.  On  January  31,  2025,  LA  LGBT  Center  was  awarded  a  Cost  Reimbursable \n22 Subaward by UCLA under the NIH Grant pursuant to which LA LGBT Center is performing all \n23 phases of study implementation for the Race & Place Study. The subgrant to the LA LGBT Center \n24 totaled $2,068,560. \n25 9.  The Cost Reimbursement Research Subaward Agreement between UCLA and LA \n26 LGBT Center is attached as Exhibit B.  \n27\n3 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF JOE HOLLENDONER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 57     Filed 04/07/25     Page 4 of 8\n \n \n1 10.  LA LGBT Center’s work on the Race & Place Study includes recruiting, enrolling, \n2 and  maintaining  the  optimal  study  cohort,  conducting  study  visits,  coordinating  retention, \n3 performing  data  collection  and  entry,  providing  data  reports,  responding  to  queries,  and \n4 maintaining participant files.  \n5 11.  LA  LGBT  Center  also  employs  peer  navigators  and  case  managers  that  are \n6 responsible for meeting with study participants and addressing their social, medical, and mental \n7 health needs. LA LGBT Center also employs research coordinators and laboratory technicians who \n8 oversee phlebotomy, collection and processing of specimens. \n9 12.  At least two of LA LGBT Center’s employees dedicated to the Race & Place Study \n10 are fully funded by the NIH Grant.  \n11 13.  LA  LGBT  Center’s  work  in  the  Race  &  Place  Study  is  consistent  with  the \n12 requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 283p, which directs that the Director of NIH “shall, as appropriate, \n13 encourage  efforts  to  improve  research  related  to  the  health  of  sexual  and  gender  minority \n14 populations, including by—(1) facilitating increased participation of sexual and gender minority \n15 populations in clinical research supported by the National Institutes of Health [and] (2) facilitating \n16 the development of valid and reliable methods for research relevant to sexual and gender minority \n17 populations[.]” \n18 14.  Upon information and belief, on or about March 20, 2025, UCLA received a Notice \n19 of Termination, purporting to immediately terminate the NIH Grant (the “Termination Notice”).  \n20 15.  According to the Termination Notice, the NIH Grant was terminated because \n21 “[r]esearch  programs  based  primarily  on  artificial  and  non-scientific  categories,  including \n22 amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our \n23 knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance \n24 health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”   \n25 16.  The Termination Notice further justified the NIH Grant’s termination by claiming \n26 that “so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) studies are often used to support unlawful \n27\n4 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF JOE HOLLENDONER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 57     Filed 04/07/25     Page 5 of 8\n \n \n1 discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of \n2 Americans.” \n3 17.  The Termination Notice is attached as Exhibit C.  \n4 18.  This termination is devastating to the LA LGBT Center and the communities that \n5 were to be served by the Race & Place Study. Without access to this essential funding stream, the \n6 Race & Place Study simply cannot continue and will cease to exist. As a result, participants in the \n7 study will go without many of the important services they receive for participating including, \n8 critically, substance use and HIV treatment.  \n9 19.  Additionally, without the funding from the NIH Grant, the LA LGBT Center will \n10 be forced to terminate the two employees dedicated to the Race & Place Study and whose positions \n11 are entirely funded by the NIH Grant.  \n12 Gender-Affirming Stigma Intervention to Improve Substance Misuse and HIV Risk among \n13 Transgender Women Grant \n14 20.  Upon information and belief, the Illinois Institute of Technology in July 2024 won \n15 an NIH Grant (“Gender NIH Grant”) to investigate health disparities and outcomes among \n16 transgender and gender-diverse populations, focusing on substance use, mental health, and barriers \n17 to healthcare access to inform evidence-based interventions and improve public health strategies. \n18 21.  On August 1, 2024 the LA LGBT Center was awarded a subaward under this grant \n19 in the amount of $12,536. \n20 22.   A copy of the subaward letter is attached as Exhibit D. \n21 23.  The LA LGBT Center uses these funds to partially fund at least one employee to \n22 conduct recruitment and enrollment of participants into this clinical trial. \n23 24.  On March 21, 2025 the grant was terminated based on “Research programs based \n24 on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do \n25 nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously \n26 examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.”  \n27\n5 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF JOE HOLLENDONER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 57     Filed 04/07/25     Page 6 of 8\n \n \n1 25.  The Termination Notice is attached as Exhibit E. \n2 26.  The termination letter indicates that no corrective action was deemed possible due \n3 to the fundamental incompatibility of the grant's premise with current NIH priorities, directly \n4 aligned with the implementation of the contested Executive Order. \n5 27.  The NIH Grants are not the only federal funding that the LA LGBT Center relies \n6 upon and experiencing the termination of the NIH Grant has only heightened the concerns and \n7 challenges we are already facing because of the Executive Orders that were detailed in my \n8 February 25 Declaration. And now, enforcement of the Executive Orders against us is not only \n9 imminent but is clearly already occurring and I am concerned that the NIH Grant is just the first \n10 of many existing federal grants LA LGBT Center receives funding under that will be terminated. \n11 B. The Domestic Violence National Resource Center Grant.  \n12 28.  LA LGBT Center also receives a $2.25 million grant (the “DV Resource Center \n13 Grant”) from the OFVPS, a component of Defendant U.S. Department of Health & Human \n14 Services, to serve as a national resource center focused on domestic violence related to the \n15 LGBTQ+ community. As part of that training and technical assistance program, the LA LGBT \n16 Center is required to submit all training materials for approval before they go into the field.  \n17 29.  A purpose of the OFVPS is to award grants to create and maintain national and \n18 special issue resource centers focused on preventing and addressing family, domestic, and dating \n19 violence. These centers provide resource information, training, and technical assistance to enhance \n20 the capacity of individuals, organizations, governmental entities, and communities in delivering \n21 effective intervention services. 42 USC §10410(a)(2). \n22 30.  In addition to these, the statute authorizes grants to “support training and technical \n23 assistance that address emerging issues related to family violence, domestic violence, or dating \n24 violence, to entities demonstrating related expertise.” 42 USC §10410(a)(2)(B)(ii). The LA LGBT \n25 Center was funded to be such a national resource center for LGBTQ+ related domestic violence \n26 issues. \n27\n6 \n28\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF JOE HOLLENDONER IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMPLAINT AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CASE NO. 4:25-cv-01824-JST \n \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-01824-JST     Document 57     Filed 04/07/25     Page 7 of 8\n \n \n1 31.  Recently, the LA LGBT Center was advised that it must remove terms like “LGBT,” \n2 “queer,” “trans,” “transgender,” etc. from materials submitted to the agency or else it risks having \n3 the DV Resource Center Grant terminated.   \n4 32.  Loss of the DV Resource Center Grant would mean that LA LGBT Center would \n5 no longer be able to provide its intimate partner violence training and those living in abusive \n6 relationships would suffer as a result. LA LGBT Center, therefore, is put in an impossible position. \n7 Do we continue to do what we have always done and what is central to our mission and recognize \n8 the existence of members of the LGBTQ community, including transgender individuals, or do we \n9 recast our work to combat financial harm to our organization and prevent the elimination of certain \n10 programs?

Plaintiffs are mission-driven nonprofits that specialize in the delivery of high-\n2 quality healthcare, social, and other critical services to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n3 transgender, and queer (“LGBTQ”) community; an organization dedicated to ending the human \n4 immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (“AIDS”) epidemic; \n5 and a historical society whose mission is to record and celebrate the history of the LGBTQ \n6 community. All Plaintiffs receive federal funding to support their work. \n7 2.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  suit  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  with  respect  to \n8 Executive Order No. 14168, 90 Fed. Reg. 8650 (Jan. 20, 2025), “Defending Women From Gender \n9 Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” (“Gender \n10 Order”), issued January 20, 2025; Executive Order No. 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025), \n11 “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” (“DEI-1 Order”), \n12 issued January 20, 2025; Executive Order No. 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025), “Ending \n13 Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” (“DEI-2 Order”), issued January \n14 21, 2025 (collectively, the “Executive Orders”); and related agency directives that seek to enforce \n15 illegal, ultra vires Presidential action. \n16 INTRODUCTION \n17 3.  In the days following his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump issued a flurry \n18 of executive orders plunging the federal government into chaos. Included in those orders were \n19 three that seek to punish and defund Plaintiffs for acknowledging the existence of transgender \n20 people, advocating for their rights, and adopting an equitable approach to the provision of their \n21 services that recognizes the rich diversity of the United States.  \n22 4.  The Gender Order in particular expresses and imposes on others a disparaging, \n23 demeaning,  idiosyncratic,  and  unscientific  viewpoint  about  transgender  people  and  gender \n24 identity; repudiates the existence of transgender people; deems their identities to be “false;” and \n25 orders their exclusion from government recognition and protection in numerous aspects of their \n26 lives.  \n27\n28\n  1   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 4 of 73\n \n \n1 5.  The DEI-1 Order expresses a viewpoint that “diversity, equity, inclusion, and \n2 accessibility,” “DEIA,” or related programs are “illegal and immoral discrimination programs,” \n3 and, among other things, directs agencies to terminate all equity-related grants or contracts.  \n4 6.  The DEI-2 Order lays out specific mechanisms to punish contractors and grantees \n5 that embrace principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or accessibility, including mechanisms \n6 for the termination of already-appropriated funds to those contractors and grantees and for \n7 excluding the same from future contracts and/or grants.  \n8 7.  The Executive Orders together target Plaintiffs and the people they serve for \n9 opprobrium and exclusion from services that receive federal financial assistance because of who \n10 they are. Seeking to leverage the federal government’s vast reach throughout the economy to \n11 control private thought and speech, President Trump has instructed federal agencies to condition \n12 federal contracts and grants on private parties’ commitments to silencing themselves regarding \n13 “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” or the very existence of transgender people.  \n14 8.  The work that all Plaintiffs do is critical to thousands of LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ \n15 people across our country. This work documents the Nation’s rich and diverse history; provides \n16 life-saving health care, housing, and other social services to people from all walks of life in a \n17 manner that respects everyone for who they are; builds community; and promotes wellness. To do \n18 this, Plaintiffs must be able to serve the people who need them by recognizing their humanity and \n19 personhood, and by tailoring services in a manner that acknowledges and addresses the many \n20 structural and societal barriers that their patients, clients, and patrons face.  \n21 9.  The Executive Orders pose an existential threat to transgender people and the \n22 organizations that respect their existence, shield them from harm, provide them with life-saving \n23 services and community, and engage in core protected speech advocating for their liberation.  \n24 10.  The  Executive  Orders  should  be  declared  unconstitutional,  and  their \n25 implementation should be enjoined.  \n26\n27\n28\n  2   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 5 of 73\n \n \n1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2 11.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises \n3 under the laws of the United States and the United States Constitution. \n4 12.  An actual controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \n5 § 2201(a), and this Court may grant declaratory, injunctive, and other relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n6 §§ 2201-2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n7 13.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \n8 and (e)(1) because each defendant is an agency of the United States or an officer of the United \n9 States sued in their official capacity; Plaintiffs San Francisco AIDS Foundation, GLBT Historical \n10 Society, and San Francisco Community Health Center reside in this district; and a substantial part \n11 of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred and continue to occur in this district \n12 where San Francisco AIDS Foundation, GLBT Historical Society, and San Francisco Community \n13 Health Center reside.  \n14 DIVISIONAL ASSIGNMENT \n15 14.  Pursuant to Civil L.R. 3-2(c) and (d), this action should be assigned to the San \n16 Francisco Division because a substantial part of the events and the resulting injuries occurred in \n17 San Francisco County, California. \n18 PARTIES \n19 A.

Plaintiff GLBT Historical Society is devoted to recording and disseminating the \n19 stories of LGBTQ people and their struggle for legal recognition and respect across generations.  \n20 47.  The GLBT Historical Society exists to tell these stories. The history of LGBTQ \n21 people is one of self-expression, pride, and a celebration of the very existence of all LGBTQ \n22 people. The GLBT Historical Society’s Archives and Special Collections are among the largest \n23 and most extensive holdings in the world of materials about LGBTQ+ people, occupying more \n24 than 4,000 linear feet of storage and spanning more than a century’s worth of LGBTQ+ history.  \n25 48.  To advance its mission, the GLBT Historical Society receives and has received \n26 federal grant funding from Defendant NARA and Defendant NEH.  \n27\n28\n  9   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 12 of 73\n \n \n1 iii.  Plaintiff Health Centers \n2 49.  Plaintiff Health Centers, which include SF Health Center, LA LGBT Center, and \n3 Prisma Community Care, are mission-driven community health centers that provide healthcare \n4 services, social services, community, and support for the LGBTQ community.  \n5 50.  Plaintiff Health Centers serve disproportionately low-income LGBTQ patients \n6 from a variety of backgrounds who frequently experience discrimination from other healthcare and \n7 social services providers on the basis of race, sex, and LGBTQ status.  \n8 51.  Plaintiff Health Centers receive federal funding in the form of grants and/or \n9 contracts and specialize in offering quality healthcare and social services free of discrimination, \n10 including  to  youth,  seniors,  domestic  violence  survivors,  and  patients  with  life-threatening \n11 conditions. A core aspect of their missions is to advance the civil rights of LGBTQ people. \n12 iv.  The LGBTQ Community Centers \n13 52.  Plaintiff LGBTQ Community Centers, which include SF Health Center, LA LGBT \n14 Center, NY LGBT Center, Bradbury-Sullivan Center, and Baltimore Safe Haven, offer myriad \n15 social services to members of the LGBTQ community addressing their housing, employment, \n16 sexual health, substance use, and mental health needs, among others, as well as youth and senior \n17 populations. Their missions include advocacy for equality for all LGBTQ people. Plaintiff LGBTQ \n18 Centers receive federal funding to support certain services they provide.  \n19 v.  FORGE \n20 53.  Plaintiff FORGE’s work focuses on training service providers who work with \n21 victims of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, stalking, and hate crimes to increase their \n22 knowledge of how to better serve transgender and nonbinary victims of crime. FORGE also \n23 provides direct support, resources, and healing services to transgender community members. \n24 FORGE receives federal funding to support certain services it provides. \n25 vi.  Plaintiffs’ Shared Purpose  \n26 54.  The work that the GLBT Historical Society does to record the history of LGBTQ \n27 people celebrates their existence and calls for a more just future.  \n28\n  10   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 13 of 73\n \n \n1 55.  The work that SFAF, Plaintiff Health Centers, the LGBTQ Community Centers, \n2 and FORGE do saves lives. To continue to do their work, Plaintiffs must be able to continue to \n3 acknowledge not only the existence of, but the equal dignity and humanity of the people they serve, \n4 including people who are transgender.  \n5 56.  In addition, Plaintiffs must continue to be able to direct their services and advocacy \n6 to communities most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to those most impacted by systemic \n7 barriers  to  health  care,  housing,  and  basic  social  services  as  a  result  of  past  and  current \n8 discrimination—including  Black,  Latinx,  and  Asian  and  Pacific  Islander  communities,  and \n9 transgender people. Plaintiffs advocate for an end to racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ bias and \n10 work to document and ameliorate structural inequities, including health disparities and housing \n11 discrimination, affecting these communities.  \n12 57.  To perform their work effectively, Plaintiffs must be able to continue to advocate \n13 for equality for those they serve; embrace their identities; be cognizant of the structural and societal \n14 barriers they experience; and train their staff in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility \n15 practices.  \n16\nB.  The Trump Administration Seeks to Erase Transgender People from Public Life, \nPromotes  Discriminatory  Viewpoints,  and  Punishes  Federal  Contractors  and \n17\nGrantees with Contrary Viewpoints.  \n18\n58.  The Trump Administration has wasted no time inflicting chaos and upheaval—with \n19\nparticularly cruel focus on the transgender community.  \n20\n59.  Reminiscent of book burnings from bygone eras, in just four weeks, the Trump \n21\nAdministration has sought to erase any mention or recognition of transgender people from and by \n22\nany part of the federal government and has demanded the same from every federal contractor and \n23\ngrantee.  \n24\n60.  In addition to the Executive Orders at issue here, the Trump Administration has \n25\ntaken a series of actions seeking to eliminate or restrict existing protections for transgender people \n26\nand has enacted myriad affirmative policies to discriminate against transgender people in all \n27\naspects of public life, including education, employment, health care, and housing, to name a few.  \n28\n  11   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 14 of 73\n \n \n1 61.  On his first day in office, President Trump issued Executive Order 14148 (“the \n2 Rescissions  Order”),  which  rescinded  several  Biden  Administration  Executive  Orders  that \n3 provided protections for transgender people.1  \n4 62.  President Trump then issued Executive Order 14183 (“the Military Service Ban \n5 Order”), banning transgender people from serving in the military, and revoked Executive Order \n6 14004, which had allowed all qualified persons to serve in the military.2  As justification, President \n7 Trump declared that “expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot \n8 satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service” and “is not consistent with the \n9 humility and selflessness required of a service member.” The language in Executive Order 14183, \n10 on its face, expressly and unequivocally evidences discriminatory animus toward transgender \n11 people. \n12 63.  President Trump also issued Executive Order 14187 (“Denial of Care Order”), \n13 declaring that “it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, \n14 or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another,” and directing the \n15 immediate  defunding  of  medical  institutions  that  provide  gender-affirming  medical  care  to \n16 transgender people under the age of nineteen.  \n17 64.  President Trump has acted to discriminate against transgender people in other \n18 contexts as well. For example, Executive Order 14170 forbids government employers from \n19 considering or even recognizing gender identity in the hiring process,3 and Executive Order 14190 \n20 eliminates federal funding for K-12 schools that “directly or indirectly support” the “instruction, \n21 advancement, or promotion” of “gender ideology” in their curricula for students or in training \n22\n23\n \n24 1 Exec.

What is more, President Trump has directed all federal agencies to “remove all \n6 statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages \n7 that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, \n8 policies, regulations, forms, communications[,] or other messages.” Gender Order § 3(e). \n9 66.  Pursuant to this purge  directive, the National  Park Service under the Trump \n10 Administration has removed any mentions of transgender people or gender identity, as well as any \n11 storytelling that incorporates discussion of gender identity or a person’s experience. As a result, \n12 the National Park Service has sought to erase American history by erasing any mention of \n13 transgender people in relation to the Stonewall National Monument.5 In response, the Stonewall \n14 Inn and the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative said in a statement: “This blatant act of erasure \n15 not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of \n16 transgender individuals - especially transgender women of color - who were at the forefront of the \n17 Stonewall Riots and the broader fight for LGBTQ+ rights.”6 \n18 67.  As part of the Trump Administration’s government-wide purge of transgender \n19 people, our Nation’s researchers and scientists have also been ordered to remove any mention of \n20 transgender people or recognition of gender identity from any federally funded research.7 The \n \n21\n4 Exec.

For example, NIH demanded a halt to a large-scale study that was examining \n6 ways to prevent HIV infections in transgender youth of color before it could enroll participants, \n7 and a federal scientific journal blocked publication of a paper that details the value of teaching \n8 transgender  health.9 All this  in  turn  has  inhibited  innovative  and  life-saving  research  from \n9 occurring and prohibited a single vulnerable minority—transgender people—from benefitting \n10 from it.  \n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19  \nwiped-from-federal-websites-following-trump-order-targeting-transgender-rights; Jeremy Faust, \n20 “BREAKING NEWS: CDC orders mass retraction and revision of submitted research across all \nscience and medicine journals.

When ordered by a federal court to restore websites containing invaluable data and \n2 resources for educational, medical, and scientific institutions across the country, the Trump \n3 Administration appended to the websites, such as the one pertaining to the CDC’s Youth Risk \n4 Behavior Surveillance System, a notice stating: “Any information on this page promoting gender \n5 ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there \n6 are two sexes, male and female. The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns \n7 the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, \n8 by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect \n9 biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it.” \n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19 69.  Notwithstanding binding guidance issued by the whole commission, the new acting \n20 chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), appointed by President \n21 Trump, has taken the following unilateral actions pursuant to the Gender Order, among others: \n22   Announced  that  one  of  her  priorities—for  compliance,  investigations,  and \n23 litigation—is to defend the biological and binary reality of sex; \n24   Removed the EEOC’s “pronoun app,” which allowed an employee to opt to identify \n25 pronouns alongside the employee’s display name throughout platforms used to \n26 communicate with internal and external parties; \n27\n28\n  15   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 18 of 73\n \n \n1   Ended the use of the “X” gender marker during the intake process for filing a charge \n2 of discrimination; \n3   Directed the modification of the charge of discrimination and related forms to \n4 remove “Mx.” from the list of prefix options; \n5   Commenced review of the content of the EEOC’s “Know Your Rights” poster, \n6 which all covered employers are required by law to post in their workplaces; and \n7   Removed materials promoting “gender ideology” on the EEOC’s internal and \n8 external websites and documents, including webpages, statements, social media \n9 platforms, forms, trainings, and others outlets or programs.10  \n10 70.  The U.S. Department of State has similarly enacted the Trump Administration’s \n11 erasure policies. For example, the Gender Order directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland \n12 Security  to  implement  changes  to  require  that  government-issued  identification  documents, \n13 including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, reflect solely the holder’s sex assigned at \n14 birth—thus preventing transgender people from carrying federal identity documentation that \n15 accords with their gender identities. Gender Order § 3(d). The Department of State has thus \n16 prohibited transgender Americans, including those who are nonbinary, from obtaining passports \n17 and other federal identity documents that accurately reflect their gender.11   \n18 71.  The Department of State has also removed transgender people from its webpage \n19 providing warnings to LGBTQ people about international travel.12  \n20\n21\n \n22\n10 Press Release, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, “Removing Gender Ideology \n23 and Restoring the EEOC’s Role of Protecting  Women in the  Workplace” (Jan. 28, 2025), \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/removing-gender-ideology-and-restoring-eeocs-role-\n24\nprotecting-women-workplace.  \n25 11 Shawn Musgrave, “Rubio Orders State Department to Stop Issuing Accurate Passports to Trans \nPeople,” The Intercept (Jan. 23, 2025), https://theintercept.com/2025/01/23/marco-rubio-state-\n26 department-passports-gender-trans-nonbinary/.  \n27 12 Alex Kasprak, “Yes, State Department eliminated references to trans people on its websites,” \nSnopes (Feb. 4, 2025), https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/travel-state-gov-lgb/.  \n28\n  16   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 19 of 73\n \n \n1 72.  Through the Gender Order, President Trump has also ordered the rescission of rules \n2 that ensure transgender people have equal access to homeless shelters and the denial of necessary \n3 medical care to transgender persons in federal custody. Gender Order §§ 4(b)-(c).  \n4 73.  This battery of animus-laden acts has been so alarming that in a recent hearing in a \n5 case challenging the Military Service Ban Order, the court described President Trump’s attempt \n6 to  ban  transgender  servicemembers  from  the  military  as  “part  and  parcel  to  an  overall \n7 administrative push to discriminate [against] or demean transgender people” and proceeded to \n8 provide a rolling list of actions exemplifying the Administration’s intent to erase transgender \n9 people and preclude their ability to participate in society. 13  \n10 74.  Among the parade of horrors, Judge Ana C. Reyes of the United States District \n11 Court for the District of Columbia included the very Gender Order now before this Court: “[The \n12 administration] announced it is cutting all federal funding to any federal grant recipients or \n13 contractors who recognize the existence of transgender people or provide services to them.”14 \n14 75.  In a different case involving a challenge to the Denial of Care Order, the court in \n15 that case stated, in relation to the Denial of Care Order and the Gender Order, that: “The Court \n16 cannot fathom discrimination more direct than the plain pronouncement of a policy resting on the \n17 premise that the group to which the policy is directed does not exist.”15 \n18\ni.  President Trump Issues the Gender Order that Forbids Contractors and \nGrantees from Acknowledging the Existence of Transgender People and Their \n19\nRight to Equality and Respect. \n20\n76.  President Trump issued the Gender Order on January 20, 2025. The Gender Order \n21\nexpresses a disparaging, demeaning, idiosyncratic, and unscientific viewpoint about transgender \n22\npeople and gender identity, denying that transgender people exist, deeming them “false,” ordering \n23\n24\n \n13 Transcript of Status Conference at 34-35, Talbott v.

Section 2(a) of the Gender Order states that a person’s “sex” is an “immutable \n4 biological classification as either male or female” and that it “does not include the concept of \n5 ‘gender identity.’” \n6 78.  The  definitions  contained  in  the  Gender  Order  deny  the  existence of  gender \n7 identities that differ from a person’s sex assigned at birth and repudiate the existence of people \n8 who are transgender altogether. Specifically, Section 2 of the Gender Order establishes that it is \n9 the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” which “are not \n10 changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” Section 2 further states \n11 that “the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the \n12 following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law \n13 and administration policy.”  \n14 79.  Section 2 of the Gender Order defines “Female” to mean “a person belonging, at \n15 conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell,” and “Male” to mean “a person \n16 belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.”  \n17 80.  Section  2  of  the  Gender  Order  defines  what  it  terms  “gender  ideology”  as \n18 “replac[ing] the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender \n19 identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice \n20 versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. Gender ideology \n21 includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex. \n22 Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful \n23 category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed \n24 body.” Federal agencies have subsequently described “[t]he term ‘gender ideology’ [as] refer[ring] \n25 to self-assessed gender identity.”  \n26 81.  In addition, Section 2 of the Gender Order defines what it terms “gender identity” \n27 as “reflect[ing] a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality \n28\n  18   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 21 of 73\n \n \n1 and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for \n2 identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.” \n3 82.  Section 3(b) of the Gender Order directs each agency to “give the terms ‘sex’, \n4 ‘male,’ ‘female,’ ‘men,’ ‘women,’ ‘boys’ and ‘girls’” (punctuation corrected) the meanings \n5 defined in the Gender Order “when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and \n6 in all other official agency business, documents, and communications.” \n7 83.  Section 3(e) of the Gender Order demands that agencies “take all necessary steps, \n8 as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.”  \n9 84.  Section 3(g) of the Gender Order prohibits the use of federal funds “to promote \n10 gender ideology” and directs each agency to “assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and \n11 ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”  \n12 85.  Section 7 of the Gender Order requires each agency to submit an update on the \n13 Gender Order’s implementation within 120 days, including “agency-imposed requirements on \n14 federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of” the executive order. \n15 86.  Defendants,  therefore,  penalize  federal  contractors  and  grantees,  including \n16 Plaintiffs, whose speech, trainings, research, and/or mission-driven services express or reflect \n17 viewpoints that acknowledge the existence of transgender people and advocate for their equality.  \n18\nii.  President Trump Also Issues Two Sweeping Executive Orders to Defund \nActivities and Penalize Entities that Have “Illegal DEI and DEIA Policies.” \n19\n20 87.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued the DEI-1 Order, which expresses a \n21 viewpoint that “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” “DEIA,” or related programs are \n22 “illegal and immoral discrimination programs.” \n23 88.  To execute President Trump’s policy, for example, Section 2(b)(i) of the DEI-1 \n24 Order directs “[e]ach agency, department, or commission head . . . [to] terminate, to the maximum \n25 extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and ‘environmental justice’ offices and positions; all ‘equity \n26 action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts; and all \n27 DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.” \n28\n  19   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 22 of 73\n \n \n1 89.  On January 21, 2025, President Trump also issued the DEI-2 Order. The DEI-2 \n2 Order states that “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” “DEI,” “diversity, equity, inclusion, and \n3 accessibility,”  or  “DEIA”  policies  are  “illegal,  dangerous,  and  immoral”  and,  in  the \n4 Administration’s view, violate federal civil rights laws. As expressed in its title, the DEI-2 Order \n5 also characterizes “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” efforts as oppositional to merit-\n6 based opportunity.  \n7 90.  The DEI-2 Order restricts “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility” by \n8 federal contractors and grantees. As expressed in Section 1, the DEI-2 Order characterizes \n9 “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and “DEI,” and “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” \n10 and “DEIA,” as “dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences”; “illegal” \n11 in violation of “the text and spirit of . . . Federal civil-rights laws”; “undermin[ing] our national \n12 unity”; “deny[ing], discredit[ing], and undermin[ing] the traditional American values of hard \n13 work, excellence, and achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-\n14 based spoils system”; “threaten[ing] the safety of American men, women, and children across the \n15 Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination \n16 when  selecting  people  for  jobs  and  services  in  key  sectors  of American  society”;  “illegal, \n17 pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were \n18 capable of doing”; and “illegal preferences and discrimination.” \n19 91.  Section 2 of the DEI-2 Order directs “all executive departments and agencies . . . \n20 to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, \n21 guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements” to “protect the civil \n22 rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work” and “to \n23 enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, \n24 mandates, policies, programs, and activities.” \n25 92.  Section 3(b) of the DEI-2 Order instructs OFCCP to “immediately cease . . . \n26 [p]romoting ‘diversity’”; “[h]olding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking \n27 ‘affirmative action’”; and “[a]llowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to \n28\n  20   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 23 of 73\n \n \n1 engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national \n2 origin.”  \n3 93.  Section 3(b) further requires each agency head to “include in every contract or grant \n4 award: (A) a term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its \n5 compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the \n6 government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; \n7 and (B) a term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any \n8 programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.”  \n9 94.  Section 3(c) of the DEI-2 Order directs the Director of the OMB to “(i) Review and \n10 revise, as  appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and  guidance; (ii) Excise \n11 references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal \n12 acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, \n13 improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and (iii) Terminate \n14 all ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ ‘equitable decision-making,’ ‘equitable deployment of financial and \n15 technical assistance,’ ‘advancing equity,’ and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, \n16 as appropriate.” \n17 95.  Section 4(a) of the DEI-2 Order directs the heads of all agencies to “take all \n18 appropriate actions with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector \n19 the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work,” which the DEI-2 Order asserts is \n20 inconsistent with “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” \n21 96.  Section 4(b) of the DEI-2 Order directs the Attorney General to submit a report \n22 “containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate \n23 measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including \n24 DEI.” In addition, the Attorney General’s report must “contain a proposed strategic enforcement \n25 plan identifying: (i) Key sectors of concern within each agency’s jurisdiction; (ii) The most \n26 egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern; (iii) A plan of specific \n27 steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated ‘DEI’ or \n28\n  21   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 24 of 73\n \n \n1 otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. As a part of this plan, each agency \n2 shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, \n3 large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or \n4 more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with \n5 endowments over 1 billion dollars; (iv) Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end \n6 illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws; (v) \n7 Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of \n8 interest; and (vi) Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance.”  \n9 97.  The  chilling  effect  of the  Executive  Orders  is  magnified  by  their  provisions \n10 directing officials to create various lists of private individuals and organizations suspected of \n11 opposing  the  Administration’s  views.  Section  2(b)(ii)  of  the  DEI-1  Order  directs  agency, \n12 department, and commission heads to provide the Director of OMB with a “list” of contractors \n13 “who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees” \n14 and grantees “who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or ‘environmental \n15 justice’ programs, services, or activities” in the last four years.  \n16 98.  The threat of these lists has a deterrent effect on speech. If Plaintiffs are placed on \n17 these lists, they will be further deterred—either directly by subsequent adverse government action \n18 or indirectly through negative consequences such as reputational harms. Moreover, the Executive \n19 Orders do not make clear whether such lists will be made public. If so, the lists would invite \n20 targeted harassment, hostility, and threats by members of the public. \n21 99.  The penalties that the Orders threaten also go beyond loss of funding. The DEI-2 \n22 Order invokes the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–33, and its harsh treatment of “material” \n23 false statements to the government, 31 U.S.C. § 3729(1)(a)(B). Section 3(b)(iv)(A) of the DEI-2 \n24 Order  requires  that,  “for  purposes  of  section  3729(b)(4)  of  title  31,  United  States  Code,” \n25 contractors  and  grantees  agree  that  compliance  with  the  Administration’s  undefined  and \n26 unarticulated understanding of applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is “material” to the \n27 government’s payment decisions. By invoking the FCA, the DEI-2 Order exposes Plaintiffs to \n28\n  22   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 25 of 73\n \n \n1 private lawsuits, government prosecution, and potential penalties of up to three times the amount \n2 of the government’s damages.  \n3 100.  Taken together, the DEI-1 and DEI-2 Executive Orders express the viewpoint that \n4 most “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” policies, programs, and activities do not \n5 comply with federal civil rights laws, do not advance federal civil rights laws, and must cease. \n6 Defendants thus penalize federal grant recipients and contractors, including Plaintiffs, whose \n7 speech, trainings, research, and/or mission-driven services express or reflect viewpoints that \n8 support “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” efforts, and who seek to assist Black \n9 people, women, LGBTQ people, and people living with HIV, among others, in overcoming \n10 systemic barriers to equality resulting from past and current discrimination.  \n11\niii.  Executive Directives Related to the Executive Orders Evidence the Trump \nAdministration’s Viewpoint Discrimination that Reinforces Both an Anti-\n12\nTrans Bias that Will Erase Transgender Identities and Opposition to DEIA \n13 Initiatives. \n14 101.  In  the  days  following  the  release  of  the  Executive  Orders,  the  Trump \n15 Administration  engaged  in  a  broad-based  attack  against  speech  and  viewpoints  related  to \n16 “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.” These actions further confirm that the purpose of \n17 the Executive Orders is to suppress and chill viewpoints with which the Trump Administration \n18 disagrees and to inflict harms against transgender people and marginalized populations. \n19 102.  For example, on January 21, 2025, the acting director of the Office of Personnel \n20 Management (“OPM”) released a memo titled “Initial Guidance Regarding DEIA Executive \n21 Orders” (the “January 21 OPM Memo”) that purported to implement the DEI-1 Order.16 The \n22 January 21 OPM Memo directed agencies to take “prompt actions” against “DEIA initiatives and \n23 programs,” including requiring agencies to “terminate any DEIA-related contractors,” among \n24\n25\n26\n \n27 16 https://www.opm.gov/media/e1zj1p0m/opm-memo-re-initial-guidance-regarding-deia-\nexecutive-orders-1-21-2025-final.pdf. \n28\n  23   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 26 of 73\n \n \n1 other actions, within 24 hours. The January 21 OPM Memo further demanded a report within 48 \n2 hours of “all DEIA-related agency contracts.”17    \n3 103.  On January 22, 2025, the White House released “Fact Sheet: President Donald J. \n4 Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI.”18 This “Fact \n5 Sheet” explains that the DEI-2 Order terminates “radical DEI preferencing in federal contracting” \n6 and directs “federal agencies to relentlessly combat private sector discrimination.” It claims that \n7 “DEI has dangerously tainted many of our critical businesses and influential institutions,” “DEI’s \n8 foundational rhetoric and ideas foster intergroup hostility and authoritarianism,” and “Billions of \n9 dollars are spent annually on DEI, but rather than reducing bias and promoting inclusion, DEI \n10 creates and then amplifies prejudicial hostility and exacerbates interpersonal conflict.”  \n11 104.  On January 23, 2025, President Trump announced at the World Economic Forum \n12 that his Administration “has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and \n13 inclusion nonsense — and these are policies that were absolute nonsense — throughout the \n14 government and the private sector.”19  \n15 105.  On  January  27,  2025,  the  Acting  Director  of  OMB  issued  a  memo  titled \n16 “Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs” (“OMB \n17 Memo M-25-13”).20 OMB Memo M-25-13 purported to implement a series of executive orders \n18 signed by President Trump, including the DEI-1 Order and the Gender Order, and directed \n \n19\n17 Id. at 1–2. The January 21 OPM Memo also sought to root out what OPM characterized as \nefforts to evade the Trump Administration’s policy. The memo included an email template for \n20\nagency heads to send to their employees, notifying them that the Trump Administration is “aware \n21 of efforts by some in the government to disguise these [DEIA] programs by using coded or \nimprecise language.”  The email directed employees who know about such efforts to report them \n22\nto an email address “DEIAtruth@opm.gov” and threatens unspecified “adverse consequences” for \nnot doing so. The January 21 OPM Memo also demanded a “list” of “contract descriptions or \n23\npersonnel position descriptions” that had been recently “changed” to “obscure their connection to \n24 DEIA programs.

DEI, [and] woke gender ideology[.]” OMB Memo M-25-13 contained a \n4 footnote explaining that “Medicare or Social Security benefits” were the only federal assistance \n5 programs that it did not cover.21  \n6 106.  The Administration’s initiatives around DEI were mutually reinforcing of the \n7 Administration’s clear intent to target transgender people.  \n8 107.  On January 29, 2025, the acting director of OPM issued a memo titled “Initial \n9 Guidance Regarding President Trump’s Executive Order Defending Women” (the “January 29 \n10 OPM Memo”) that purports to implement the Gender Order.22 The January 29 OPM Memo is \n11 similar to the January 21 OPM Memo implementing the DEI-1 Order, insofar as it gives agencies \n12 48 hours to “terminate” all programs, contracts, and grants and “[c]ancel any trainings that \n13 inculcate or promote gender ideology or have done so in the past,” among other things. \n14 108.  To implement the President’s Executive Orders, the Agency Defendants have \n15 begun issuing stop-work orders or contract termination notices, forcing organizations to “cease \n16 and desist” performance of contracts, programs, and activities relating to diversity, equity, and \n17 inclusion. Plaintiffs are among those who have received such stop-work orders or termination \n18 notices. \n19\n \n21 The breathtaking scope of OMB Memo M-25-13 spurred widespread chaos and confusion. The \n20\nnext day, multiple groups successfully sued to temporarily enjoin its enforcement for violating the \n21 Constitution and the APA. See Order at 5, National Coalition of Nonprofits, et al. v. OMB, et al., \nNo. 1:25-cv-00239 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025) (ECF No. 13); Temporary Restraining Order, New York, \n22 et al. v.

In a public statement, however, \nthe White House Press Secretary said that OMB only rescinded OMB Memo M-25-13 to “end any \n24\nconfusion caused by the court’s injunction,” the recission of the Memorandum was “NOT a \n25 rescission of the federal funding freeze,” and the “President’s EO’s [sic] on federal funding remain \nin  full  force  and  effect,  and  will  be  rigorously  implemented.”  \n26 https://x.com/PressSec/status/1884672871944901034. \n27 22 https://chcoc.gov/content/initial-guidance-regarding-president-trump%E2%80%99s-executive-\norder-defending-women. \n28\n  25   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 28 of 73\n \n \n1 109.  Following the issuance of the Executive Orders and related guidance, grantees, \n2 including some of Plaintiff Health Centers, who had received awards funded by Defendant HHS \n3 or  a  subagency  thereof  received  notices  pursuant  to  the  Executive  Orders  “immediately, \n4 completely, and permanently” terminating the awards for which the notices were sent.  \n5 110.  On January 29, 2025, SF Health Center and Prisma Community Care both received \n6 notices from the CDC which specifically cited the DEI-1 Order and the Rescissions Order and \n7 stated as follows: \n8 To implement Executive Orders entitled Ending Radical and Wasteful Government \n9 DEI Programs and Preferencing and Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive \n10 Orders and Action, you must immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all \n11 programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting “diversity, equity, and \n12 inclusion” (DEI) at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the \n13 citizenship of employees or contractors, that are supported with funds from this \n14 award. Any vestige, remnant, or re-named piece of any DEI programs funded by \n15 the  U.S.  government  under  this  award  are  immediately,  completely,  and \n16 permanently terminated. \n17 No additional costs must be incurred that would be used to support any DEI \n18 programs, personnel, or activities. \n19 (Emphasis added.) \n20 111.  On or about January 31, 2025, Plaintiffs SF Health Center and Prisma Community \n21 Care both received notices from the CDC that specifically cited the Gender Order and stated as \n22 follows: \n23 To  implement  the  Executive  Order  entitled  Defending  Women  From  Gender \n24 Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government \n25 (Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological \n26 Truth To The Federal Government – The White House), and in accordance with \n27 Office of Personnel Management’s Initial Guidance (Memorandum to Heads and \n28\n  26   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 29 of 73\n \n \n1 Acting Heads of Departments and Agencies: Initial Guidance Regarding President \n2 Trump’s Executive Order Defending Women), you must immediately terminate, to \n3 the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting or \n4 inculcating gender ideology at every level and activity, regardless of your location \n5 or the citizenship of employees or contractors, that are supported with funds from \n6 this award.  Any vestige, remnant, or re-named piece of any gender ideology \n7 programs funded by the U.S. government under this  award are immediately, \n8 completely, and permanently terminated. \n9 No additional costs must be incurred that would be used to support any gender \n10 ideology programs, personnel, or activities. \n11 (Emphasis added.) \n12 112.  Similarly, HRSA, another subagency of Defendant HHS, has sent notices to grant \n13 recipients stating that HRSA grant funds may not be used for activities that “do not align with” the \n14 Executive Orders and any “vestige, remnant, or re-named piece of any programs in conflict with \n15 these E.O.s are terminated in whole or in part.” \n16 113.  For example, on January 31, 2025, the NY LGBT Center received a notice from \n17 HRSA that specifically cited the DEI-1 Order, the DEI-2 Order, the Gender Order, and the \n18 Rescissions Order and stated as follows: \n19 Your Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) award is funded in \n20 whole or in part with U.S. government funds.  \n21 Effective immediately, HRSA grant funds may not be used for activities that do not \n22 align  with  Executive  Orders  (E.O.)  entitled  Ending  Radical  and  Wasteful \n23 Government  DEI  Programs  and  Preferencing,  Initial  Rescissions  of  Harmful \n24 Executive Orders and Action, Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical \n25 Mutilation,  and  Defending  Women  from  Gender  Ideology  Extremism  and \n26 Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government (Defending Women).

On February 5, 2025, the OPM Acting Director issued a memorandum titled \n7 “Further Guidance Regarding Ending DEIA Offices, Programs and Initiatives” instructing federal \n8 agencies  to  terminate  all  DEIA  offices,  policies,  and  programs  that  allegedly  “unlawfully \n9 discriminate” in employment actions based on protected characteristics, including race, sex, \n10 national origin, and disability. This memorandum defines “unlawful discrimination relating to \n11 DEI” in the following way: “Unlawful discrimination related to DEI includes taking action \n12 motivated,  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  protected  characteristics.  To  be  unlawful,  a  protected \n13 characteristic does not need to be the sole or exclusive reason for an agency’s action.” \n14 115.  On  February  5,  2025,  Attorney  General  Bondi  issued  a  memorandum  to  all \n15 employees of the DOJ titled, “Ending Illegal DEI and DEIA Discrimination and Preferences \n16 (“DOJ Memorandum 1”). It purports to implement the DEI-2 Order, which it describes as \n17 “making clear that policies relating to ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (‘DEI’) and ‘diversity, \n18 equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (‘DEIA’) ‘violate the text and spirit of our longstanding \n19 Federal civil-rights laws’ and ‘undermine our national unity.’”  \n20 116.  DOJ Memorandum 1 directs the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to investigate and \n21 penalize entities in both the private sector and federally funded educational institutions that it \n22 considered to be engaged in DEI and DEIA policies and programs.  \n23 117.  The memorandum also directs the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division and the Office of \n24 Legal Policy to submit a report by March 1, 2025, recommending enforcement actions against DEI \n25 and DEIA policies. The report must identify key sectors of concern; specific entities alleged to be \n26 the most “egregious” DEI/DEIA “practitioners”; a plan for deterring DEI and DEIA policies \n27 through  criminal  investigations  and  civil  compliance  actions,  including  up  to  nine targeted \n28\n  28   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 31 of 73\n \n \n1 investigations; potential litigation strategies, including interventions in pending cases, statements \n2 of interest, and amicus briefs; and additional regulatory and policy measures aimed at eliminating \n3 DEI and DEIA programs. \n4 118.  Also, on February 5, 2025, the Attorney General Bondi issued a memorandum \n5 titled, “Eliminating Internal Discriminatory Practices” (“DOJ Memorandum 2”) to all DOJ \n6 employees implementing the DEI-2 Order. It directs the elimination of DOJ DEI and DEIA \n7 programs, policies, and related initiatives. \n8 119.  DOJ Memorandum 2 further directs, by March 15, 2025, the DOJ to assist OMB in \n9 reviewing and revising government-wide policies to eliminate references to DEI and DEIA in \n10 federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures. \n11 120.  On February 7, 2025, the White House published “Memorandum for the Heads of \n12 Executive Departments and Agencies.” In this public-facing memo, President Trump declared that \n13 “[i]t is the policy of my administration to stop funding NGOs that undermine the national interest” \n14 and the agencies “shall align future funding decisions with the interests of the United States and \n15 with the goals and priorities of my Administration, as expressed in executive actions.”  \n16 121.  The deluge of agency actions and statements by the Trump Administration leave \n17 no doubt that the purpose of the Executive Orders is to suppress speech and viewpoints supportive \n18 of transgender people and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts with which the \n19 Administration disagrees.  \n20 iv.  The Executive Orders Are Impermissibly Vague. \n21 122.  The challenged Executive Orders are replete with vague and undefined terms and \n22 phrases whose precise meanings are key to understanding the scope of the orders’ prohibitions. \n23 Under the terms of the challenged Executive Orders, there is no objective way to determine which \n24 speech activities are permitted and which are prohibited, creating a broad chilling effect and \n25 inviting unpredictable, uneven, and discriminatory enforcement against recipients of federal \n26 funding, including Plaintiffs.  \n27\n28\n  29   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 32 of 73\n \n \n1 123.  For example, nowhere do the Executive Orders explain exactly what it means to \n2 “promote” so-called “gender ideology.”  \n3 124.  Neither do the Executive Orders define the terms “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” \n4 “DEI,” “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” or “DEIA,” despite such terms being \n5 fundamental to the Executive Orders. Similarly, the Executive Orders do not define the term \n6 “equity” when used independently from “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” even \n7 though Section 2(b) of the DEI-1 Order terminates “equity-related” grants and contracts, along \n8 with other DEI and DEIA activities. \n9 125.  Section 3(c) of the DEI-2 Order uses both vague terminology and open-ended \n10 breadth in mandating OMB to “[e]xcise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever \n11 name they may appear” from federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance \n12 procedures. (Emphasis added.) Plaintiffs, therefore, are left speculating on what speech or activity \n13 might be considered DEI or DEIA “principles” even without using the actual terms “DEI” or \n14 “DEIA.”  \n15 126.  In addition, the Executive Orders create additional ambiguity by distinguishing at \n16 times between DEIA that is “legal” from that which is “illegal.” For example, in Section 2 of the \n17 DEI-2 Order, President Trump expresses a policy of terminating all “discriminatory and illegal \n18 preferences”  and  “combat[ting]  illegal  private-sector  DEI  preferences,  mandates,  policies, \n19 program, and activities.” Similarly, Section 3(b) of the DEI-2 Order requires every federal contract \n20 or grant to include a certification from the contractor or grantee that “it does not operate any \n21 programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination law.” \n22 127.  The language in these provisions regarding illegality begs the question of who \n23 determines which diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility policies, programs, and activities \n24 are legal, as opposed to illegal, and pursuant to what criteria. Given the Trump Administration’s \n25 actions already taken to eliminate DEIA from the federal workplace, it is likely that all DEIA \n26 policies, programs, and activities would be considered illegal by this Administration even without \n27 an investigation. \n28\n  30   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 33 of 73\n \n \n1 128.  This is especially true because the Executive Orders provide no clear, objective \n2 standards for enforcement. In the absence of any objective standards, the Executive Orders give \n3 the  Trump  Administration  unfettered  discretion  to  enforce  the  prohibitions  against  federal \n4 contractors and grantees, inviting arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement subject to the whims \n5 of the decisionmaker.  \n6 129.  Despite being impermissibly vague, the Executive Orders include a range of serious \n7 penalties, including cancellation of existing contracts and grants; loss of eligibility for future \n8 government contracts and grants; and potential civil investigations, regulatory actions, and/or \n9 litigation.  Thus,  the  vagueness  of  the  Executive  Orders’  terms  exacerbates  the  preexisting \n10 censorship of Plaintiffs’ speech activities by producing an even greater chilling effect. \n11 130.  Because the provision of effective and comprehensive housing and health care \n12 services, support, education, and advocacy for LGBTQ people and people living with HIV \n13 necessarily requires education about and awareness of the historical and ongoing inequities \n14 resulting from, among other things, a person’s race, sex, and/or transgender status, data collection, \n15 and attention to health disparities, Plaintiffs have no way to discern how to differentiate between \n16 the acceptable provision of services in furtherance of their mission and the unacceptable “operation \n17 and promotion of DEI” programs and activities or unacceptable promotion of “gender ideology.”  \n18 C.  Plaintiffs Have Been Injured by the Executive Orders.  \n19 i.  Plaintiff SFAF \n20 131.  SFAF promotes health, wellness, and social justice for communities affected by \n21 HIV through advocacy, education, community partnerships, and direct services. Over the past four \n22 decades, SFAF has been at the forefront of the fight against HIV and AIDS, providing free, \n23 comprehensive services to approximately 27,000 clients annually. These services include harm \n24 reduction, behavioral health care, sexual health care, HIV prevention and care, and community \n25 engagement initiatives tailored to diverse populations.

For Fiscal Year 2025–\n5 2026, SFAF is expected to receive approximately two million dollars in direct and indirect funding. \n6 Of this amount, more than $600,000 is directly funded through agreements with CDC, and the \n7 balance is indirectly funded by a variety of federal agencies through subcontracts and/or grants \n8 with state and local agencies.  \n9 133.  This funding supports a national model for HIV prevention, and enables SFAF to \n10 provide HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services to thousands of people living with or at \n11 risk of contracting HIV. Because of this funding, SFAF is able to expand comprehensive sexual \n12 health services to populations most affected by HIV and sexually transmitted infections (“STIs”) \n13 and leverage feedback systems such as surveys, listening sessions, and focus groups to assess \n14 community needs and create equitable and inclusive clinic-level plans. \n15 134.  The Executive Orders, if enforced, will not permit SFAF to receive these federal \n16 grants.  \n17 135.  Consequently, the Executive Orders will have a profound and damaging impact on \n18 all of SFAF’s federally funded programs and services, which are critical in providing HIV \n19 prevention, sexual health services, and harm reduction efforts to the most vulnerable populations. \n20 136.  For example, SFAF’s core HIV prevention efforts rely on federal funding to \n21 provide services such as testing and treatment to underserved communities. The DEI-1 and DEI-2 \n22 Orders restrictions on DEI programs will severely limit SFAF’s capacity to deliver services \n23 tailored to the unique needs of marginalized groups, including BIPOC, transgender and nonbinary \n24 individuals, and men who have sex with men—groups that face disproportionate barriers to \n25 accessing these life-saving health services.  \n26 137.  In  addition,  the  Executive  Orders’  emphasis  on  eliminating  recognition  of \n27 transgender identity and restricting community-specific interventions hinders SFAF’s ability to \n28\n  32   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 35 of 73\n \n \n1 address the social determinants of health—such as stigma, homelessness, and substance use—that \n2 disproportionately affect these groups. This, in turn, will exacerbate HIV prevalence within these \n3 communities.  \n4 138.  Similarly,  SFAF  receives  funding  to  address  the  MPOX  resurgence  that \n5 disproportionately affects gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, and transgender \n6 and  gender  non-binary  individuals.  The  restrictions  concerning  DEI  and  acknowledging \n7 transgender people could lead to decreased MPOX vaccine acceptance and access, reducing the \n8 effectiveness of this program and potentially increasing the spread of MPOX among vulnerable \n9 groups.  \n10 139.  Targeting  services  to  minority  and  transgender  communities  is  essential  for \n11 effective HIV treatment and prevention because these populations experience disproportionate \n12 rates  of  HIV  due  to  systemic  barriers.  Decades  of  epidemiological  research  consistently \n13 demonstrates that tailored outreach, testing, and prevention services are more successful in \n14 reaching these communities, improving health outcomes, and reducing transmission rates. The \n15 CDC  and  other  public  health  authorities  have  long  recognized  that  interventions  designed \n16 specifically for populations at higher risk are critical to ending the HIV epidemic. In line with this \n17 evidence, government contracts funding HIV outreach and care programs include requirements to \n18 target these communities, ensuring resources are directed where they are most needed and have \n19 the greatest positive public health impact. This approach is not only evidence-based but also \n20 essential to fulfilling public health goals and health equity mandates \n21 140.  The  Executive  Orders  fundamentally  conflict  with  SFAF’s  commitment  to \n22 addressing systemic barriers to health and SFAF’s core values of promoting justice, dignity, \n23 courage, leadership, excellence, diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout its organization and \n24 the populations SFAF serves.  \n25 141.  Moreover, maintaining a diverse, inclusive staff is necessary and mission-critical \n26 to SFAF’s core purpose. The success of SFSF’s programs depends on SFAF’s ability to recruit \n27\n28\n  33   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 36 of 73\n \n \n1 and retain staff who reflect the communities the organization serves—an essential factor in \n2 delivering effective, culturally humble care.  \n3 142.  Consequently, the Executive Orders are an existential threat to SFAF’s mission and \n4 the consequences will be devastating: reduced access to HIV prevention and care in communities \n5 already facing the highest barriers, increased mistrust in healthcare systems, higher rates of late \n6 HIV diagnosis, and lower rates of viral suppression. Decades of public health research confirm \n7 that one-size-fits-all approaches to HIV prevention and care fail to meet the needs of communities \n8 most affected by HIV.  \n9 ii.  Plaintiff GLBT Historical Society  \n10 143.  Founded in 1985, the GLBT Historical Society is a global leader in LGBTQ+ public \n11 history. The GLBT Historical Society established and continues operating the first museum of \n12 LGBTQ+ history and culture in the United States, which it founded fourteen years ago. The GLBT \n13 Historical Society also established and still maintains the Dr. John P. DeCecco Archives, one of \n14 the largest repositories of LGBTQ+ historical materials in the world. \n15 144.  The GLBT Historical Society collects, preserves, exhibits, and makes accessible to \n16 the public materials and knowledge to support and promote understanding of LGBTQ+ history, \n17 culture, and arts in all their diversity. The GLBT Historical Society’s Archives and Special \n18 collections are among the largest and most extensive holdings in the world of materials about \n19 LGBTQ+ people, occupying more than 4,000 linear feet of storage.  \n20 145.  The GLBT Historical Society’s 1,000+ collections provide source material to \n21 diverse researchers, including educators, students, journalists, filmmakers, professional scholars, \n22 artists and others. The publicly accessible reading room is available to researchers throughout the \n23 year and serves an incredibly high volume of remote researchers through its website, email, and \n24 phone reference services and digital collections. Visitors come from all over the world to engage \n25 with materials used in producing a wide array of exhibitions, books, academic publications, theses, \n26 documentaries, films, and works of visual and performing arts.  \n27\n28\n  34   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 37 of 73\n \n \n1 146.  The GLBT Historical Society (whose founding members and earliest collections \n2 included transgender people) would not be able to advance public knowledge and accurate \n3 history—invaluable resources for understanding the challenges of the present and inspiring dreams \n4 for a future of greater social justice for its community—without creating access to accurate \n5 representations of transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive people throughout time. \n6 147.  For  nearly  twenty  years,  federal  funding,  mainly  from  Defendant  NEH  and \n7 Defendant  NARA  (through  the  National  Historic  Publications  and  Records  Commission \n8 (“NHPRC”), has allowed the GLBT Historical Society to preserve, digitize, catalog, and make \n9 accessible thousands of materials for public research. \n10 148.  Current funding from an open NHPRC grant of approximately $120,000 supports \n11 work to process, digitize, and create online access for collections related to LGBTQ+ Asian \n12 American/Pacific Islander people. \n13 149.  The GLBT Historical Society also has an open NEH grant of approximately \n14 $10,000 that supports the purchase of new archival preservation supplies and a storage cabinet to \n15 ensure the continued care of the ever-expanding collections. \n16 150.  Should the GLBT Historical Society lose federal funding as a result of its inability \n17 to comply with the Executive Orders, it would not be able to process, digitize, and make accessible \n18 priceless historical materials that help researchers, scholars, educators, students, and artists create \n19 tens of thousands of intellectual and artistic contributions that support a healthy and thriving civil \n20 society. \n21 151.  The Executive Orders, if enforced, would inflict irreparable harm on the GLBT \n22 Historical Society and its community. They would jeopardize the GLBT Historical Society’s \n23 ability to sustain its operations, staff, and programs that depend on federal funding. They would \n24 compromise the ability to fulfill the GLBT Historical Society’s mission, vision, and values that \n25 guide its work. They would damage the ability to preserve and share the community’s history, \n26 culture, and arts, which are essential for collective identity, memory, and resistance. They would \n27\n28\n  35   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 38 of 73\n \n \n1 also deprive the public of the opportunity to access and learn from the GLBT Historical Society’s \n2 historical materials, which are vital for education, research, and artistic creation. \n3 iii.  Plaintiff SF Health Center \n4 152.  SF Health Center is a Federally Qualified Health Center (“FQHC”) and has \n5 operated in the San Francisco Bay Area for nearly forty years. SF Health Center is dedicated to \n6 providing comprehensive health care services to underserved populations, including LGBTQ+ \n7 individuals (with a concerted focus on transgender individuals), people of color, individuals \n8 experiencing homelessness, and people living with or vulnerable to HIV. Diversity, equity, and \n9 inclusion are rooted in its mission to transform lives by advancing health and wellness for these \n10 vulnerable and marginalized communities.  \n11 153.  SF Health Center has committed to ensuring its workforce composed of those with \n12 the lived experience of its clients—48% of its 180 employees identify as trans or gender non-\n13 conforming; 76% are people of color; and 28% identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Of SF Health \n14 Center’s more than 5,000 patients, 25% are transgender or gender non-conforming,70% are people \n15 of color, and 60% are unhoused or marginally housed. SF Health Center’s commitment to diversity \n16 has allowed it to provide lifesaving health outcomes to meet the needs of those communities it \n17 serves. \n18 154.  SF Heath Center currently receives several federal grants from various subagencies \n19 of HHS, including CDC and SAMHSA, in an annual aggregate amount of over $1.5 million. SF \n20 Health Center also has a multiyear grant from HRSA with an annual award of over $1.4 million \n21 because of its designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center. SF Health Center also receives \n22 pass-through federal funds through the San Francisco Department of Public Health totaling $2.2 \n23 million annually (in the form of HRSA Ryan White and Ending HIV Epidemic grants). \n24 155.  The  $1,505,500  in  awards  from  the  CDC  and  SAMHSA  include  the \n25 Comprehensive High-Impact HIV Prevention Programs for Young Men of Color Who Have Sex \n26 With Men and Young Transgender Persons of Color Grant in the amount of $400,000 per year; \n27 grant funds under the Community-Based Approaches to Reducing Sexually Transmitted Diseases \n28\n  36   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 39 of 73\n \n \n1 award in the annual amount of $305,500; Minority AIDS Initiative: Prevention Navigator Program \n2 for Racial/Ethnic Minorities and High Risk Populations in the annual amounts of $300,000 and \n3 $500,000, respectively.  \n4 156.  Shortly after the Executive Orders were signed, SF Health Center received multiple \n5 termination/stop work orders. These included notices with respect to its CDC awards instructing \n6 it to “immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or \n7 contracts promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) at every level and activity, regardless \n8 of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors, that are supported with funds from \n9 this award”; and to “immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, \n10 activities, or contracts promoting or inculcating gender ideology at every level and activity, \n11 regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors, that are supported with \n12 funds from this award.”  \n13 157.  Because of the vaguely worded DEI-1 Order and DEI-2 Order which do not define \n14 the terms “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion” and the Gender Order’s redefinition of gender to \n15 forbid the recognition of transgender people, the SF Health Center cannot understand how to \n16 comply with both the Executive Orders and the purpose of the federal grants and other legal \n17 obligations under those grants that the SF Health Center is required to provide.  \n18 158.  The Executive Orders directly threaten the termination of SF Health Center’s \n19 programs  and  services  that  are  grounded  in  historical  health  equity  and  racial  justice \n20 underpinnings.  \n21 159.  The Executive Orders appear to dismiss data that informs the work that the SF \n22 Health Center performs which has revealed the institutional inequities that have disproportionately \n23 affected the delivery of care to the most vulnerable members of society. The Executive Orders’ \n24 language  effectively  erases  evidenced-based  public  health  data,  which  demonstrates  that \n25 communities  of  color,  LGBTQ+  individuals,  and  people  living  with  HIV  experience \n26 disproportionately poor health outcomes. These disparities are rooted in historical and structural \n27 discrimination,  including  racism,  xenophobia,  misogyny,  homophobia,  and  transphobia.  To \n28\n  37   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 40 of 73\n \n \n1 address these inequities, the SF Health Center employs evidence-based, community-defined, \n2 culturally competent care models that acknowledge the unique needs and life experiences of its \n3 clients. SF Health Center’s programs are designed to both treat illness and address the social \n4 determinants of health that contribute to persistent disparities. \n5 160.  The SF Health Center provides care to the transgender community, which in \n6 particular, faces significant barriers to accessing health care. Transgender individuals are more \n7 likely to experience health care discrimination, economic insecurity, life-threatening violence, and \n8 homelessness, all of which contribute to poorer health outcomes. The services the SF Health \n9 Center provides include mental health support, HIV treatment and prevention, case management, \n10 and primary medical care. These treatments are proven to dramatically improve health outcomes \n11 for transgender people. The SF Health Center has already seen an uptick in depression, anxiety, \n12 and suicidal thoughts amongst its patients since the Executive Orders were signed. \n13 161.  The Executive Orders fundamentally undermine SF Health Center’s ability to \n14 continue to provide critical services. To comply with the Gender Order, SF Health Center would \n15 be forced to effectively deny the existence of transgender and gender-diverse people and abandon \n16 evidence-based practices that are essential to providing medical care to its transgender clients and \n17 at the core of its mission. \n18 162.  Similarly, the DEI-1 Order’s attack on DEI initiatives directly threatens SF Health \n19 Center’s capacity to train staff in the cultural competencies necessary to serve its diverse client \n20 base. The Executive Orders will deny SF Health Center’s ability to provide transgender-sensitivity \n21 trainings, equip healthcare providers with the skills to address implicit bias, understand cultural \n22 health beliefs, and build the rapport and trust required with clients from marginalized communities. \n23 These DEI programs are essential to SF Health Center’s ability to help its providers gain comfort \n24 in treating racially and gender-diverse patients, increase awareness of racial health disparities, and \n25 improved fluency in gender-affirming medical terminology. The loss of DEI-informed practices \n26 will create barriers to culturally competent care, particularly for communities of color who already \n27 experience negative health outcomes due to systemic racism. \n28\n  38   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 41 of 73\n \n \n1 163.  Public health principles demonstrate the importance of prioritizing services for \n2 populations with elevated health risks. SF Health Center’s HIV prevention programs, for example, \n3 include targeted outreach and testing for transgender women of color, who face disproportionately \n4 high HIV acquisition rates. SF Health Center’s Asian and Pacific Islander HIV programs address \n5 cultural barriers and shame that have prevented access to HIV and mental health resources. Their \n6 Black  Health  programming  focuses  on  the  specific  mistrust  of  the  prevailing  medical  and \n7 healthcare system to bridge access to providers who can build the necessary trust and rapport to \n8 combat stigma prevalent in communities of color.  \n9 164.  If the Executive Orders are allowed to stand, SF Health Center will have to either \n10 abandon its mission to provide targeted, culturally competent care to marginalized communities, \n11 or forfeit the federal funding supporting its services. Without these resources, SF Health Center \n12 will be forced to reduce services, shutter programs, and turn away clients who rely on it for basic \n13 and essential healthcare. \n14 iv.  Plaintiff LA LGBT Center  \n15 165.  The mission of the LA LGBT Center is to fight bigotry and build a world where \n16 LGBT people thrive as healthy, equal, and complete members of society. Today the LA LGBT \n17 Center’s approximately eight hundred employees provide services for more LGBTQ people than \n18 any other organization in the world, with more than 500,000 client visits per year. \n19 166.  The LA LGBT Center is the largest provider of services to LGBTQ people in the \n20 world. Many of the LA LGBT Center’s patients come to it seeking culturally competent health \n21 care due to being denied care or being discriminated against based on their real or perceived sexual \n22 orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and HIV status. The LA LGBT Center’s client \n23 population is disproportionately low-income and experiences high rates of chronic physical and \n24 mental conditions, homelessness, unstable housing, trauma and discrimination, and stigmatization \n25 in health care services. The client population is diverse with respect to race and class, and more \n26 than 55% of its patients self-report that they are non-white or of Latinx ethnicity. Many clients \n27\n28\n  39   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 42 of 73\n \n \n1 come to the LA LGBT Center from different areas of California, other states, and even other \n2 nations to seek services in a safe and affirming environment. \n3 167.  Respecting transgender people and advancing their civil rights is central to the LA \n4 LGBT Center’s identity, advocacy, and mission, and a necessary part of every aspect of the \n5 services it provides. Nearly every aspect of the services provided by the LA LGBT Center directly \n6 or indirectly affects the transgender community, and the LA LGBT Center has provided its services \n7 to over 6,000 transgender individuals over the past ten years—the majority of such services \n8 relating to their medical care. \n9 168.  The LA LGBT Center provides a wide spectrum of healthcare services, including, \n10 but not limited to, HIV treatment, testing, and prevention care, and mental health care. The LA \n11 LGBT Center has medical providers who specialize in the care of transgender patients and provide \n12 a full range of primary care services in addition to hormone therapy, pre- and post-surgical care, \n13 and trans-sensitive pap smears, pelvic exams, and prostate exams. The LA LGBT Center’s broad \n14 array of healthcare services are all under one organization, from counseling and therapy to \n15 pharmaceutical and nutrition needs. In many cases, these services are quite literally lifesaving. \n16 169.  The LA LGBT Center also provides numerous mental health-related services, \n17 which  are  particularly  important  for  the  many  patients  who  have  experienced  traumatic \n18 discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, HIV status, and \n19 other factors. The LA LGBT Center’s health care providers have treated many patients who have \n20 experienced traumatic stigma and discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, \n21 transgender status, sex stereotypes, HIV status, and/or other factors. \n22 170.  The LA LGBT Center is one of the nation’s largest and most experienced providers \n23 of LGBTQ health and mental health care. As an FQHC, the LA LGBT Center is required to serve \n24 anyone, on a nondiscriminatory basis, who walks through its doors. \n25 171.  The LA LGBT Center is a direct and indirect recipient of several federal contracts \n26 and grants. A significant portion of the LA LGBT Center’s revenue comes from federal programs, \n27 including, but not limited to, direct funding from the CDC and grants from the HRSA Bureau of \n28\n  40   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 43 of 73\n \n \n1 Primary Health Care under which the LA LGBT Center is an FQHC. The LA LGBT Center also \n2 receives federal funding for research programs and is currently a participant in multiple federally \n3 funded studies. \n4 172.  The LA LGBT Center works hard in numerous ways to identify and address \n5 disparities in access to health care and patient health inequities based on race, sex, national origin, \n6 and LGBTQ status. The LA LGBT Center provides training to its own staff, as well as to external \n7 partners and to the public. Internal staff training educates the LA LGBT Center’s staff about \n8 identifying and acknowledging disparities in underlying health conditions, cultural and historical \n9 barriers to care, and combating implicit bias that could interfere with patient-provider interactions, \n10 the ability of patients to receive equitable access to care, and patient outcomes. \n11 173.  The LA LGBT Center has implemented a framework to train its staff about such \n12 issues, which is meant to acknowledge and address systemic racism and the role of implicit bias \n13 in contributing to health disparities, including anti-LGBTQ bias. The lack of such training would \n14 exacerbate healthcare disparities that LGBTQ people, trans people, and people of color face in the \n15 broader healthcare environment—an outcome directly contrary to the LA LGBT Center’s grant \n16 mandates and fundamentally at odds with its mission to provide the highest-quality health care to \n17 patients without discrimination. Without addressing systemic obstacles to care, the LA LGBT \n18 Center cannot successfully fulfill the obligations of its federal funding. \n19 174.  The Gender Order, by prohibiting the promotion of “gender ideology,” seems to \n20 condition federal funding on the denial of the very existence of transgender people. It is impossible \n21 for the LA LGBT Center to fulfill its mission and provide any of its services to transgender patients \n22 and clients without acknowledging and recognizing transgender people for who they are. Part of \n23 the LA LGBT Center’s mission is to “fight against bigotry” and to help “build a better world—a \n24 world in which LGBTQ people can be healthy, equal, and complete members of society.”  \n25 Accordingly, the LA LGBT Center’s values of “Courage” and “Liberation” require it to “center \n26 the members of our community who need its care the most” and “to ensure the safety and freedom \n27\n28\n  41   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 44 of 73\n \n \n1 of all LGBTQ+ people.”  By definition, this includes recognizing the existence, identities, and \n2 experience of the transgender and gender diverse community members. \n3 175.  The  LA  LGBT  Center’s  mission  includes  ensuring  LGBTQ  individuals, \n4 particularly transgender people, of all backgrounds can be healthy, equal, and complete members \n5 of society. The Executive Orders make it difficult, if not impossible, for the LA LGBT Center to \n6 continue providing the same level of social, mental, and physical health care and related social \n7 services to its patients, external partners, and the public. The LA LGBT Center plainly cannot \n8 accomplish its mission—and its mandates under existing grants—should the Executive Orders be \n9 allowed to stand. \n10 v.  Plaintiff Prisma Community Care  \n11 176.  Prisma Community Care is committed to providing barrier-free access to healthcare \n12 for all and is dedicated to providing services to advance health equity for diverse communities. \n13 Prisma  Community  Care  does  this  by  building  trust  with  vulnerable  communities  through \n14 emphasizing the importance of having staff that is reflective of those communities. This includes \n15 people who are transgender, gender-expansive, BIPOC and/or Latinx. By promoting diversity, \n16 equity, inclusion and accessibility, Prisma Community Care has created a team that is able to \n17 cultivate a culture of trust and understanding among transgender, gender diverse, BIPOC and \n18 Latinx communities. Prisma Community Care’s focus on affirming and inclusive services allows \n19 it to improve the health outcomes of all of its patients.  \n20 177.  Prisma Community Care receives nearly $4 million in federal funding annually, \n21 both in direct contracts with federal agencies and in pass-through federal funds received from \n22 Arizonia State agencies.  \n23 178.  Prisma Community Care receives direct funding from the federal government via \n24 grants from HRSA under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (as defined below) and through \n25 HHS under Title X of the PHSA. Prisma Community Care also receives indirect pass-through \n26 funding via subagencies of HHS, including the CDC and SAMHSA. The direct and indirect federal \n27 funds Prisma Community Care receives are critical to its ability to provide health services to \n28\n  42   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 45 of 73\n \n \n1 diverse communities, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and queer individuals, and those affected by \n2 HIV. These funds are used to support services including Prisma Community Care’s primary care \n3 services; low- to no-cost HIV testing; rapid start initiation for HIV treatment; STI testing; PrEP \n4 and nPEP therapy and navigation; family planning services; mental health services; nutrition \n5 services; outreach and education; and more. Prisma Community Care would be required to \n6 terminate almost 40% of its staff within one week without the direct and indirect federal funding. \n7 179.  As part of this work, Prisma Community Care’s programs provide outreach services \n8 to BIPOC, queer, men who have sex with men, and transgender people, for HIV and STI education \n9 and prevention. These programs use grant funds from HRSA, CDC, and PHSA grants, which \n10 require Prisma Community Care to provide this outreach, education, and free HIV testing to these \n11 targeted underserved populations. \n12 180.  The grants from HRSA, CDC and PHSA require Prisma Community Care to submit \n13 activity reports to ensure that the key populations are receiving the intended services. Therefore, \n14 Prisma Community Care cannot determine how to comply with the Executive Orders without \n15 simultaneously violating the requirements of these grants. \n16 181.  In Prisma Community Care’s grant terms and conditions, Prisma Community Care \n17 is mandated to comply with all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. The grant \n18 terms  and  conditions  also  expressly  require  Prisma  Community  Care  to  follow  the  anti-\n19 discrimination mandates in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of Rehabilitation \n20 Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination Act \n21 of 1975, Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care \n22 Act, and expressly prohibit Prisma Community Care to discriminate based on race, national origin, \n23 sex, age, or disability.  \n24 182.  Prisma Community Care has received demands in the HHS Payment Management \n25 System funding portal that Prisma Community Care “immediately terminate, to the maximum \n26 extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ \n27 (DEI) at every level and activity all DEI activities” and cease activities promoting “gender \n28\n  43   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 46 of 73\n \n \n1 ideology” that rely on CDC funds to comply with the Executive Orders. Given that Prisma \n2 Community Care’s core mission depends on having a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion to \n3 provide effective and compassionate care to historically marginalized groups, including people \n4 who are transgender and gender-diverse, it would be impossible for Prisma Community Care to \n5 comply with both the Executive Orders and the terms of its federal funds.  \n6 183.  Prisma Community Care serves over 30,000 people in Arizona by providing access \n7 to vital health services and support to individuals in diverse communities especially BIPOC, \n8 LGBTQ+ and queer individuals and those affected by HIV. Prisma Community Care’s ability to \n9 function  depends  entirely  on  its  commitment  to  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  and  its \n10 acknowledgement and understanding of gender diversity. \n11 vi.  Plaintiff NY LGBT Center \n12 184.  Diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the recognition of and support for transgender \n13 individuals is woven into the very fabric of the NY LGBT Center’s mission and are at the heart of \n14 the behavioral and mental health, substance use, and other services it offers by acknowledging that \n15 certain communities have been historically neglected and harmed by racism, transgender bias, \n16 sexism, and poverty. This includes LGBTQ people who are BIPOC, transgender, poor/working-\n17 class,  living  with  HIV/AIDS,  immigrants,  and/or youth.  The  NY  LGBT  Center puts  these \n18 communities at the center of all its work and is committed to serving all members of the LGBTQ \n19 community.  \n20 185.  More than $2 million of the NY LGBT Center’s annual budget comes from federal \n21 funding, in both direct grants from federal agencies and in pass-through federal funds received \n22 from New York State agencies.  \n23 186.  The NY LGBT Center receives direct funding from the federal government via \n24 grants from SAMHSA and the Office of Victims of Crime in the DOJ (the “DOJ OVC”). The NY \n25 LGBT Center also receives indirect pass-through funding via various New York State agencies, \n26 including the New York State Office of Victim Services, New York State Department of Health, \n27 and the New York State Office of Addiction Services and Support (“OASAS”). The direct and \n28\n  44   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 47 of 73\n \n \n1 indirect federal funds the NY LGBT Center receives are critical to its ability to provide the range \n2 of important services it offers to members of the LGBTQ+ community. The federal funds the NY \n3 LGBT Center receives are also used to support several full-time employees whose work is \n4 necessary to provide these services.  \n5 187.  The NY LGBT Center’s behavioral and mental health services represent a holistic \n6 approach to wellness and empowerment for the LGBTQ community. This includes recovery \n7 programming designed to help members of the LGBTQ community lead healthy lives through \n8 substance use  treatment, mental health counseling, recovery groups, HIV/AIDS  testing and \n9 education. The NY LGBT Center also provides services and programs designed for LGBTQ young \n10 people in a safe, inclusive, affirming environment where they can connect with peers, build \n11 leadership skills, and take care of their mental and physical health.  \n12 188.  It is well-researched and established that health disparities amplify due to the \n13 intersectionality of oppression. When it comes to those disproportionately affected by HIV, there \n14 are significant disparities for LGBTQ men of color and transgender women of color. The NY \n15 LGBT Center’s services are designed to meet the needs of those whose health is most affected by \n16 social inequities. This includes those who experience the greatest barriers, have the least access, \n17 and are afraid to come forward for care due to stigma, mistrust, and traumatization. The NY LGBT \n18 Center offers a wide range of LGBTQ-specific outreach, prevention, and treatment services \n19 specifically designed to remove barriers and facilitate access to care. The NY LGBT Center offers \n20 education,  outreach,  economic  stability,  treatment,  and  prevention  initiatives  to  address  the \n21 disparities in access, service use, and outcomes for LGBTQ minority populations with substance \n22 use disorders and co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders who are at risk for or \n23 living with HIV/AIDS.  \n24 189.  As part of this work, the NY LGBT Center runs an HIV & Sexual Health Services \n25 program that provides HIV and Hepatitis C testing and community outreach services to BIPOC, \n26 queer, trans, and gender-nonconforming community members. This program is paid for by funds \n27 received under a five-year grant with SAMHSA called the “RYSULT Grant.” The goal of the \n28\n  45   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 48 of 73\n \n \n1 RYSULT Grant as stated in the grant agreement with SAMHSA is to “provide training and \n2 education around the risks of substance misuse, education on HIV/AIDS to youth ages 13-24 living \n3 in NYC, specifically targeting racial minorities, and needed linkages to service provision for youth \n4 with HIV.” Pursuant to the RYSULT Grant, the NY LGBT Center is to receive $200,000 per year \n5 from SAMHSA; those funds also support 2.8 full-time employees necessary to provide these \n6 services.  \n7 190.  The NY LGBT Center also provides medical insurance enrollment services to \n8 LGBTQ individuals in New York City pursuant to a grant from the New York State Department \n9 of Health using pass-through funds the state receives from CMS. This grant’s goal is to “increase \n10 access to health insurance in the LGBT community” and the grant agreement expressly prohibits \n11 the NY LGBT Center from discriminating based on “gender and gender identity” (among other \n12 categories).  This  grant  further  specifies  that  the  NY  LGBT  Center’s  “outreach  will  focus \n13 particularly on vulnerable and hard to reach populations, particularly the LGBTQ and Latinx.” \n14 Pursuant to this grant, the NY LGBT Center is to receive approximately $500,000 per year through \n15 July 2025 to provide health insurance enrollment assistance to individuals eligible for insurance \n16 through the New York State health insurance marketplace under the federal Affordable Care Act. \n17 These funds also support 4.72 full-time employees necessary to provide these services.  \n18 191.  The NY LGBT Center provides the only licensed substance use program in New \n19 York City designed specifically to address the unique needs of LGBTQ youth. A significant part \n20 of this program is funded by SAMHSA under the name “SASHI 2.” The NY LGBT Center is  to \n21 receive $500,000 per year under this five-year grant from SAMHSA and these funds are used to \n22 provide substance use treatment and prevention counseling and mental health counseling for the \n23 LGBTQ community in New York City. Using this funding, the NY LGBT Center provides \n24 programming to increase engagement in care for racial and ethnic underrepresented individuals \n25 ages thirteen and older with substance use disorders and co-occurring substance use and mental \n26 health  disorders  who  are  at  risk  for,  or  living  with,  HIV/AIDS  and  receive  HIV/AID \n27 services/treatment.  \n28\n  46   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 49 of 73\n \n \n1 192.  The service emphasis in the SAMHSA grant for SASHI 2 is “caring for those most \n2 at risk for HIV: men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young men who have sex with \n3 men  ages  12–25;  transgender  individuals,  especially  those  involved  with  sex  work  and \n4 transactional sex; HIV-negative partners of individuals living with AIDS; minorities in the \n5 LGBTQ+ community who are Black and/or Latino/Hispanic, low-income, and/or non-English \n6 speaking or English as a Second Language.” The NY LGBT Center has designed its programming \n7 and activities to achieve this service emphasis. These funds also support 4.8 full-time employees \n8 necessary to provide these services.  \n9 193.  The NY LGBT Center was also awarded a five-year grant in 2024 by SAMHSA \n10 called the “PRIDE Grant.” The PRIDE Grant is for five years and the NY LGBT Center is to \n11 receive $375,000 per year from SAMHSA. The funds received under the PRIDE Grant will be \n12 used to run a program to reduce the onset and progression of substance use and its related problems \n13 in LGBTQ youth through training and data collection. As part of this program, the NY LGBT \n14 Center will conduct training to increase the capacity of prevention providers and stakeholders \n15 throughout New York City to improve their ability to deliver affirming and inclusive services, \n16 including to support substance use capacity training for school substance use counselors and youth \n17 service workers on providing affirming substance use prevention services to LGBTQ youth in \n18 school and community settings across New York City. The funds the NY LGBT Center is to \n19 receive under the PRIDE Grant also support 1.3 full-time employees necessary to run the program.  \n20 194.  The NY LGBT Center also receives $149,136 per year in federal pass-through \n21 funds from OASAS via SAMHSA. The NY LGBT Center’s grant from OASAS runs through \n22 September 2026 and requires the NY LGBT Center to provide Screening, Brief Intervention, and \n23 Referral to Treatment (“SBRIT”) for high school-age students. SBRIT is an evidence-based \n24 approach used to identify, reduce, and prevent problematic substance use and connect young \n25 people to care when they are screened positive. The funds the NY LGBT Center receives from \n26 OASAS also support 2.7 full-time employees necessary to provide these services.  \n27\n28\n  47   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 50 of 73\n \n \n1 195.  It is well-documented—and DOJ OVC’s Human Trafficking Taskforce reports—\n2 that people identifying as LGBTQ suffer from violent crimes at a disproportionately higher rate \n3 than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. The work of the NY LGBT Center’s staff is to understand \n4 the systemic obstacles to services that members of the LGBTQ community face due to their race, \n5 gender identity, immigration status, or other historically oppressed identities.  \n6 196.  The NY LGBT Center’s work in this area is funded, in part, by a grant from the \n7 New York State Office of Victims’ Services (“OVS”) using pass-through federal funding OVS \n8 receives from the DOJ OVC. That grant requires the funding received by the NY LGBT Center to \n9 be  used  specifically  to  help  LGBTQ  individuals  (a  population  OVS  has  identified  as \n10 “Underserved”) directly confront and heal from traumas resulting from violent crime. The NY \n11 LGBT Center receives $277,127 per year from this grant and those funds are used to provide case \n12 management, counseling services and resources for survivors of crime, including hate crimes and \n13 intimate partner violence. The funds received through the OVS grant also support 1.8 full-time \n14 employees.  \n15 197.  The NY LGBT Center also has a grant directly from the DOJ OVC pursuant to \n16 which the NY LGBT Center is contracted to receive $100,000 per year through September 2026. \n17 The funds received through this grant are to provide direct care to victims of crime, such as \n18 transportation, temporary hotel stays, food, and personal care. The funds received directly from \n19 DOJ OVC will support one full-time employee to administer the direct care and conduct intake for \n20 internal or external referrals for ongoing support.  \n21 198.  The NY LGBT Center also has an $856,000 grant from HRSA for a capital project \n22 to upgrade the  HVAC  system in its building and other necessary upgrades to its physical \n23 infrastructure. These upgrades are necessary to keep the NY LGBT Center’s employees, visitors, \n24 and the community it serves healthy and to allow its space to continuing functioning.  \n25 199.  Many of the NY LGBT Center’s grant agreements with the Agency Defendants or \n26 with state agencies administering pass-through funds from the Agency Defendants require that it \n27\n28\n  48   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 51 of 73\n \n \n1 provide targeted services to underserved minority populations. By their terms, these grants require \n2 an “equity” lens that appears to violate the DEI prohibitions.  \n3 200.  Given the broad and vague language in the Executive Orders, however, the NY \n4 LGBT Center cannot understand how to comply to continue to receive federal funding. The DEI-\n5 1 Order and DEI-2 Order purport to prohibit “illegal DEI” initiatives, yet they fail to define what \n6 is meant by “DEI” and what now would be considered unlawful under federal law. It is therefore \n7 impossible for the NY LGBT Center—an entity with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion \n8 and  historically  marginalized  groups,  including  members  of  the  LGBTQ  community—to \n9 determine what it can and cannot say and do that aligns with its mission but does not put its federal \n10 funding at risk. Similarly, it is impossible for the NY LGBT Center to determine whether it can \n11 make the representations the DOJ OVC, SAMHSA, and CMS are likely to require of it to continue \n12 to receive federal funds or whether it can use its HRSA grant to improve the facility where it carries \n13 out its mission.  \n14 201.  It is also not possible for the NY LGBT Center to operate without recognizing the \n15 transgender community, which the Gender Order would require it to ignore.  \n16 202.  The NY LGBT Center serves as a vital resource for the LGBTQ community, \n17 providing essential services, programs, and support to individuals of diverse sexual orientations, \n18 gender identities, and expressions. The NY LGBT Center’s ability to function depends entirely on \n19 its  commitment  to  inclusivity  and  its  acknowledgment  of  transgender  and  gender-diverse \n20 individuals.  \n21 203.  One of the NY LGBT Center's core purposes is recognizing and affirming the \n22 existence of transgender and gender-diverse individuals. The Executive Orders’ mandate to reject \n23 or refrain from acknowledging gender identity as distinct from sex assigned at birth would \n24 undermine the NY LGBT Center’s foundational principles and its day-to-day operations. If the \n25 NY LGBT Center were compelled to comply, it would face the untenable choice of either violating \n26 its deeply held mission or risking legal consequences for noncompliance. Compliance with the \n27\n28\n  49   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 52 of 73\n \n \n1 Executive Orders would dismantle the NY LGBT Center's identity, rendering it incapable of \n2 serving the community it was established to support. \n3 204.  The Gender Order therefore presents an existential threat to the NY LGBT Center’s \n4 mission and programs, and the well-being of its clients. Compliance would necessitate abandoning \n5 the recognition and affirmation of transgender and gender-diverse individuals, effectively erasing \n6 a significant portion of the community the NY LGBT Center exists to serve. Such a requirement \n7 is antithetical to the NY LGBT Center’s values, would cause demonstrable harm to vulnerable \n8 populations, and would undermine critical public health efforts.  \n9 205.  If the NY LGBT Center is prohibited from receiving federal funding as a result of \n10 the Executive Orders, it will be required to eliminate roles and will be unable to continue to provide \n11 many of the important and necessary services it currently provides to an otherwise underserved \n12 population and that are supported by the funds it receives from SAMHSA, CMS, DOJ OVC, and \n13 HRSA.  \n14 vii.  Plaintiff Bradbury-Sullivan  \n15 206.  Plaintiff  Bradbury-Sullivan  serves  the  Greater  Lehigh  Valley  by  providing \n16 LGBTQ+ health programs, advocacy, peer support, arts and culture events, and community-\n17 building initiatives. Since 2014, it has been a lifeline for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly \n18 transgender people and communities of color, through addressing health disparities and systemic \n19 barriers to care. \n20 207.  The Executive Orders restricting DEI programs and recognition of the transgender \n21 community threaten the Bradbury-Sullivan’s ability to serve its community and maintain critical \n22 funding. 62% of Bradbury-Sullivan’s budget relies on federal grants, including CDC-funded health \n23 initiatives through the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The DEI-related orders place these \n24 funds at risk and would force Bradbury-Sullivan to scale back essential services. \n25 208.  Bradbury-Sullivan provides culturally competent training to healthcare providers, \n26 schools, and businesses, ensuring that LGBTQ+ individuals receive equitable care. Programs like \n27 tobacco cessation, cancer screening education, and mental health advocacy rely on scientific, data-\n28\n  50   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 53 of 73\n \n \n1 driven discussions about implicit bias and systemic disparities. These topics are now potentially \n2 restricted by the Executive Orders that undermines the Bradbury-Sullivan’s ability to address the \n3 root causes of LGBTQ+ health inequities. Currently, Bradbury-Sullivan has entered into a five-\n4 year contract to provide these educational services to a partner. Although the contract is only in its \n5 first year, the partner has cancelled the contract for the remaining four years because the partner \n6 does not want to be in potential violation of the Executive Orders. \n7 209.  The Gender Order effectively erases transgender people from public health efforts, \n8 making it impossible for Bradbury-Sullivan to fulfill its mission. The DEI-related orders further \n9 block discussions of racial and LGBTQ+ health disparities, jeopardizing the Bradbury-Sullivan’s \n10 ability to provide affirming healthcare referrals, training, and social services. \n11 210.  LGBTQ+ youth, already at high risk for mental health challenges and family \n12 rejection, rely on Bradbury-Sullivan’s peer support groups, caregiver programs, and resilience-\n13 building initiatives. The Executive Orders’ restrictions on gender identity discussions could force \n14 these programs to shut down, which would cut off vital support. \n15 211.  The  Executive  Orders  put  Bradbury-Sullivan’s  future  at  risk  by  endangering \n16 training programs, health services, and outreach efforts. Bradbury-Sullivan is preparing to close \n17 its education institute because of the Executive Orders. Partner organizations are already scaling \n18 back collaborations due to compliance concerns. Without intervention, Bradbury-Sullivan may be \n19 forced to cut services, lay off staff, or close entirely, leaving thousands of LGBTQ+ individuals \n20 without support. \n21 viii.  Plaintiff Baltimore Safe Haven  \n22 212.  Baltimore Safe Haven was founded in 2018 as a mutual aid organization focused \n23 on providing life-saving support for survival sex workers and other marginalized TLGBQIA+ \n24 individuals. Their work began with a comprehensive wellness and outreach program, meeting \n25 people in overlooked parts of the city, providing safer sex education, overdose prevention tools, \n26 and peer support.  \n27\n28\n  51   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 54 of 73\n \n \n1 213.  Baltimore Safe Haven provides mobile outreach services and a drop-in center with \n2 a focus on basic needs and survival support, health and harm reduction services, community \n3 programming, and peer support, workforce support, and legal support. They launched their first \n4 housing program in 2020—an emergency and transitional housing program aimed at underserved \n5 youth  aged  18–24—and  have  since  expanded  their  housing  support  services  to  include \n6 homelessness  prevention  services  aimed  at  assisting  TLGBQIA+  individuals  at  risk  of \n7 homelessness, emergency and transitional housing, permanent supportive housing for older adults, \n8 housing placement assistance, and housing stability support.  \n9 214.  Approximately 80% of Baltimore Safe Haven’s budget comes either directly or \n10 indirectly  (via pass-through  funding  administered  by  the  State  of Maryland  and/or  City  of \n11 Baltimore) from federal agencies, including HUD, SAMHSA, and the CDC.  \n12 215.  For example, in 2024, Baltimore Safe Haven launched a capital campaign to \n13 establish its first permanent home—the Safe Haven Campus, a one-stop TLGBQIA+ housing and \n14 resource center, bringing together housing, harm reduction, healthcare, workforce development, \n15 and community-building initiatives under one roof. They secured $1 million in HUD Community \n16 Development funding to help with purchasing the building.  \n17 216.  Baltimore Safe Haven also receives approximately $3 million in operating funds \n18 via federal grant money. This includes two grants totaling nearly $1 million of HUD funding from \n19 the Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services through the City of Baltimore: one from the HUD Youth \n20 Homelessness Demonstration Project to fund their transitional housing program for 18–24-year-\n21 olds, and one from HUD’s Continuum of Care Program’s Transitional Housing/Rapid Rehousing \n22 component to fund their transitional housing and rental assistance programs. \n23 217.  Baltimore Safe Haven also receives pass-through CDC funding from the Baltimore \n24 City Health Department as part of the CDC’s High Impact HIV and Surveillance Programs for \n25 Health Departments, part of the CDC’s longstanding “Ending the HIV Epidemic” initiative.   \n26 Baltimore Safe Haven’s grant agreement with Baltimore City Health Department requires that \n27\n28\n  52   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 55 of 73\n \n \n1 Baltimore Safe Haven use these funds to HIV treatment and prevention services specifically to the \n2 transgender community.  \n3 218.  Additionally,  Baltimore  Safe  Haven  receives  over  $600,000  of  pass-through \n4 SAMSHA funding via the Maryland Department of Health. This funding is intended to support \n5 Baltimore Safe Haven’s harm reduction initiative, with a focus on preventing overdoses and the \n6 transmission of HIV among TLGBQIA+ people living in survival mode in Baltimore.  \n7 219.  Respecting, affirming, and supporting transgender people is central to Baltimore \n8 Safe Haven’s identity, advocacy, and mission, and a necessary part of every aspect of their service \n9 provision.  Baltimore  Safe  Haven  focuses  on  underserved  communities,  with  programming \n10 purposely centered around Black transgender women, recognizing that this population experiences \n11 the  most  significant  barriers  created  by  racism,  homophobia,  transphobia,  and  sexism.  The \n12 Executive Orders’ mandate to reject or refrain from acknowledging gender identity as distinct from \n13 sex assigned at birth would undermine the Baltimore Safe Haven’s foundational principles and its \n14 day-to-day operations. The Executive Orders would require Baltimore Safe Haven to ignore that \n15 Black transgender women do not have the same access to every measure of health and wellness, \n16 which would do tremendous harm to the TLGBQIA+ people who look to them for care and \n17 support. If Baltimore Safe Haven were compelled to comply, it would face the untenable choice \n18 of either violating its deeply held mission or risking legal consequences for noncompliance. \n19 Compliance  with  the  Executive  Orders  would  dismantle  Baltimore  Safe  Haven’s  identity, \n20 rendering it incapable of serving the community it was established to support. \n21 ix.  Plaintiff FORGE  \n22 220.  FORGE has been operating since 1994 and offers programs and services to reduce \n23 the impact of trauma on transgender and nonbinary survivors of violence by empowering service \n24 providers, advocating for systems reform, and connecting survivors to wellness resources. Most \n25 of FORGE’s work focuses on training service providers who work with transgender and nonbinary \n26 survivors of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and hate crimes. Central to FORGE’s \n27\n28\n  53   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 56 of 73\n \n \n1 mission is the acknowledgement of transgender people’s existence. Every aspect of the services \n2 FORGE provides directly or indirectly has an impact on the transgender community. \n3 221.  In addition, FORGE’s approach is informed by intersectionality, recognizing that \n4 the experiences of transgender and nonbinary people are further affected by other marginalized \n5 identities they may have, such as race, ethnicity, and disability, which necessitates a nuanced and \n6 comprehensive approach in all programs FORGE provides. Accordingly, all of its trainings \n7 emphasize DEI and DEIA principles because not only are transgender people an underserved, \n8 marginalized group, but transgender people of color, transgender people living with disabilities, \n9 and transgender youth face even greater levels of victimization and marginalization. Recognizing \n10 these intersections is critical to ensuring that the service providers FORGE trains are able to work \n11 effectively with different populations in the transgender community. \n12 222.  Approximately 90% of FORGE’s revenue arises from federal contracts and/or \n13 grants, including but not limited to grants from the DOJ OVC, DOJ’s Office on Violence Against \n14 Women (“DOJ OVW”), DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs, DOJ’s National Institute of Justice, \n15 HHS, NIH, SAMHSA, and the National Institutes of Health National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n16 and Alcoholism. FORGE’s existing federally funded grants support various initiatives, including \n17 the development of training materials and direct support services for transgender and nonbinary \n18 people. The federal grants are explicit in the requests for proposals that organizations should, and \n19 in some cases must, focus on target populations, including transgender people and people of color.  \n20 223.  FORGE  works  with  numerous  community  partners  on  grant-funded  work. \n21 Currently, FORGE is a subgrantee on a project with the International Association of Forensic \n22 Nurses (“IAFN”) on the National Tribal Clearinghouse on Sexual Assault funded by DOJ OVW. \n23 FORGE’s work on this project focuses on survivor services for Two-Spirit people. Two-Spirit \n24 people are Native people whose gender and sexuality do not fit into the Western colonial \n25 paradigms of the gender binary articulated in the Executive Orders. IAFN has reported to FORGE \n26 that the program manager for this grant at OVW told them that the work with Two-Spirit people \n27 under the grant had to stop because of the Executive Orders.  \n28\n  54   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 57 of 73\n \n \n1 224.  The  Executive Orders  force  Plaintiffs  to  silence  their  speech  and  viewpoints \n2 relating to issues, such as persistent race and gender inequality, that are not only of great societal \n3 importance but  also  central  to  Plaintiffs’  missions  to  advocate  for  and  provide  services  to \n4 transgender people and other marginalized communities, even outside of a government contract or \n5 grant program, or forgo federal funding. That choice is an impossible one. While Plaintiffs cannot \n6 perform their work without addressing views and ongoing concerns related to the communities \n7 they serve, they also rely on federal funding to do that work. Thus, the Executive Orders place \n8 Plaintiffs in an untenable bind that results in a chilling effect on their speech and viewpoints.  \n9\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nCOUNT I  \n10\nU.S. Constitution, First Amendment \n11 Free Speech Clause \n12 225.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n13 in Paragraphs 1 through 224 as if fully set forth herein.  \n14 226.  All Plaintiffs state this cause of action against all Defendants (including President \n15 Trump exclusively in his official capacity for purposes of declaratory relief), seek preliminary and \n16 permanent injunctions, and challenge the Executive Orders and any agency action seeking to \n17 implement the Executive Orders both facially and as applied to them. \n18 227.  Plaintiffs’ claim for relief arises from the principle of non-statutory review to enjoin \n19 Executive Officers and Departments seeking to enforce illegal, ultra vires Presidential action. \n20 228.  The First Amendment provides that the government “shall make no law . . . \n21 abridging the freedom of speech.” \n22 229.  The First Amendment provides strong protection against government attempts to \n23 control the topics discussed—and even more so, the  views  expressed—in public discourse. \n24 Accordingly, laws that restrict speakers from expressing certain viewpoints are a blatant and \n25 egregious form of government speech control that is presumed to be unconstitutional.  \n26 230.  All  Plaintiffs  engage  in  speech  and  advocacy  to  combat  anti-LGBTQ \n27 discrimination, systemic racism, and sexism, and to advance equity. Such speech and advocacy \n28\n  55   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 58 of 73\n \n \n1 constitute core political speech, are critical to their missions, and are necessary to provide their \n2 services effectively. All Plaintiffs wish to continue engaging in such speech and advocacy. \n3 231.  All Plaintiffs engage in such speech and advocacy in multiple ways. They conduct \n4 certain training of their own staff and of the staff of other federally-funded entities on topics \n5 relating to implicit bias, health disparities, and the needs of specific communities they serve. They \n6 do not conduct these training on behalf of the government itself, but for their own employees, their \n7 clients,  and/or  the  populations  they  serve.  They  receive  federal  funding  both  directly  and \n8 indirectly, including through other federal contractors  and grantees. They perform outreach \n9 specifically to populations that experience systemic obstacles to accessing medical care, housing, \n10 and other services, including anti-transgender  bias, sexism, and systemic racism. Plaintiffs’ \n11 decision to conduct trainings that advance equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility, and \n12 acknowledge  the  personhood  of  transgender  people  constitutes  protected  First  Amendment \n13 activity, as does their decision to acknowledge and address these issues in the provision of their \n14 services. \n15 232.  The purpose and effect of the Executive Orders are to suppress constitutionally-\n16 protected First Amendment activity by targeting specific content and viewpoints through a range \n17 of mechanisms. The Executive Orders endorse idiosyncratic, fringe, unscientific, and counter-\n18 factual  viewpoints  with  respect  to  (among  other  things):  diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and \n19 accessibility programs; the existence of systemic obstacles to equality experienced by members of \n20 historically-discriminated-against populations; whether discrimination continues to the present \n21 day, whether advocating for an end to such discrimination and related disparities is a worthy \n22 exercise, whether transgender people even exist, and the legal landscape surrounding enforcement \n23 of civil rights laws.  \n24 233.  The  Defendants  have  used  the  Executive  Orders  to  engage  in  impermissible \n25 viewpoint and content discrimination by penalizing Plaintiffs’ speech that expresses a contrary \n26 viewpoint to that of the government, including Plaintiffs’ core political speech. \n27\n28\n  56   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 59 of 73\n \n \n1 234.  The  Executive  Orders  penalize  Plaintiffs  for  engaging  in  protected  First \n2 Amendment activity, primarily by leveraging the federal funding that is key to their ability to \n3 operate and carry out their missions.  \n4 235.  The Executive Orders further require agencies to terminate equity-related grants \n5 and ensure that no federal funding goes to grantees or contractors for the “promotion” of an \n6 understanding that transgender people exist.  \n7 236.  The DEI-2 Order imposes coercive funding conditions that weaponize the False \n8 Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729) to deter protected speech and expression related to diversity, equity, \n9 inclusion, and accessibility. The Gender Order deems having a gender identity that differs from \n10 one’s sex assigned at birth to be a “false claim.” \n11 237.  Section 3(b)(iv) of the DEI-2 Order requires that all federal contracts and grants \n12 include a provision certifying that recipients do not engage in DEI activities that violate civil rights \n13 laws. Given the vague and undefined nature of the term “illegal DEI,” this condition creates a \n14 coercive and unconstitutional chilling effect by forcing federal grantees and contractors to either \n15 self-censor or risk prosecution under the False Claims Act. \n16 238.  The threat of civil investigations, potential False Claims Act liability, and the risk \n17 of funding termination disproportionately burden Plaintiffs and other nonprofit organizations, \n18 whose core missions involve advocacy for racial, gender, and LGBTQ equality. \n19 239.  These penalties are intended to chill the Plaintiffs from engaging in speech and \n20 related advocacy central to their missions and to coerce them to decline to engage in services and \n21 research essential to the health and welfare of the populations they serve for fear of lost contracts \n22 or funding. \n23 240.  Discrimination against speech based on its content and viewpoint is a violation of \n24 the First Amendment. Efforts to suppress speech based on the government’s opposition to the \n25 speaker’s view are unconstitutional. \n26 241.  Further, viewpoint and content discrimination are presumptively unconstitutional, \n27 requiring the government to justify its discrimination.  \n28\n  57   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 60 of 73\n \n \n1 242.  The government is unable to circumvent these First Amendment protections by \n2 acting through private third parties or conditioning government spending on restrictions to speech. \n3 243.  The Executive Orders and any related federal policy and directives violate the Free \n4 Speech Clause of the First Amendment in at least four respects.  \n5 244.  First, Defendants’ threats under the Executive Orders and any related federal policy \n6 directives impermissibly burden and chill Plaintiffs’ exercise of constitutionally protected speech, \n7 expression, and expressive conduct based on the content and viewpoint of their speech. \n8 245.  Second, Defendants intend the Executive Orders and any related federal policy \n9 directives  to  coerce  Plaintiffs  to  adopt,  endorse,  and  comply  with  the  government’s  own \n10 idiosyncratic viewpoint as if it were their own. The forced-choice framework imposed by the \n11 Executive Orders is to comply with viewpoint-based restrictions or lose federal funding. Plaintiffs \n12 are being forced to either abandon their missions or risk financial ruin, effectively silencing \n13 advocacy for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and public health protections. \n14 246.  Third, the Executive Orders and any related federal policy directives discriminate \n15 against those Plaintiffs who refuse to be chilled or coerced to comply with the government’s \n16 preferred message for engaging in protected speech and expression of their own viewpoint. The \n17 Executive Orders and related actions make clear that they have the purpose of rooting out views \n18 about DEIA that the Administration disagrees with and replacing them with its own. The Executive \n19 Orders achieve that speech-restrictive purpose by chilling speech through multiple mechanisms. \n20 247.  Finally, the Executive Orders and any related federal policy directives impose an \n21 unconstitutional condition on congressional funding by requiring Plaintiffs, as a condition of \n22 receiving public grants and contracts, to relinquish their First Amendment rights of free speech by \n23 refraining from speaking on a certain subject, i.e., DEIA. The Executive Orders are a mandate \n24 spun from whole cloth that is antithetical to the federal interests and goals of the programs.  \n25 248.  Viewpoint-based restrictions are prohibited, and content-based restrictions must \n26 satisfy strict scrutiny. The government lacks even a legitimate justification for its viewpoint and \n27 content restrictions, let alone the compelling one required here.  \n28\n  58   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 61 of 73\n \n \n1 249.  The Executive Orders inflict current, direct First Amendment injury on Plaintiffs. \n2 Further, Plaintiffs face a realistic danger of sustaining ongoing and future injuries. \n3 250.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Executive Orders violate the freedom \n4 of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. \n5 251.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \n6 the Agency Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Orders. \n7 COUNT II  \nU.S. Constitution, Fifth Amendment \n8 Due Process Clause \n9\n252.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n10\nin paragraphs 1 through 251 as if fully set forth herein. \n11\n253.  All Plaintiffs state this cause of action against all Defendants (including President \n12\nTrump exclusively in his official capacity for purposes of declaratory relief), seek preliminary and \n13\npermanent injunctions, and challenge the Executive Orders and any agency action seeking to \n14\nimplement the Executive Orders both facially and as applied to them. \n15\n254.  Plaintiffs’ cause of action arises from the principle of non-statutory review to enjoin \n16\nExecutive Officers and Departments seeking to enforce illegal, ultra vires Presidential action.  \n17\n255.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall . \n18\n. . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n19\n256.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a governmental \n20\nenactment, such as the Executive Orders, is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide a person \n21\nof ordinary intelligence with fair notice of what is prohibited or is so standardless that it authorizes \n22\nor encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement. Differently stated, governmental enactments \n23\nare unconstitutionally void for vagueness when their prohibitions are not clearly defined. Such \n24\nenactments may also be void for vagueness if they inhibit First Amendment freedoms. \n25\n257.  Vague prohibitions inhibit freedom of speech  when individuals do not know \n26\nwhether  their  speech  is  permitted  and  choose  not  to  exercise  their  rights  for  fear  of  the \n27\nconsequences. \n28\n  59   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 62 of 73\n \n \n1 258.  The Executive Orders include vague and subjective terms that lend themselves to \n2 conflicting  interpretations  and  appear  designed  to  authorize  discriminatory  and  arbitrary \n3 enforcement to achieve the maximum chilling effect on disfavored viewpoints.  \n4 259.  The Executive Orders leave Plaintiffs guessing about whether they can train their \n5 own staff who assist elderly people in finding housing about the accessibility needs of seniors in \n6 relation to housing. They leave Plaintiffs confounded about whether they can continue to research \n7 health disparities or tailor their outreach and resources to populations most affected by the HIV \n8 epidemic, including transgender women and Black men who have sex with men. Moreover, the \n9 Gender Order provides no definition of what constitutes “promotion” of gender ideology, leaving \n10 Plaintiffs guessing as to whether any acknowledgment of the existence of transgender people \n11 violates it.  \n12 260.  The Executive Orders fail to provide adequate notice as to which speech, advocacy, \n13 and activities may or may not be permitted in the performance of federal grants and/or contracts, \n14 or even permitted if funded by non-federal funds if Plaintiffs wish to continue to receive federal \n15 funding. \n16 261.  In spite of the Executive Orders’ vagueness, they include a range of penalties, \n17 including cancellation of existing contracts and loss of eligibility for future government contracts, \n18 discontinuation of federal grants, and potential False Claims Act liability. The Executive Orders \n19 require contractors and grantees to agree that compliance with the government’s vague and \n20 undefined view is “material” to funding for purposes of the False Claims Act, thus invoking the \n21 specter of vexatious private litigation and significant monetary damages under that Act.  \n22 262.  Plaintiffs engage in speech, conduct trainings and research, provide services, and \n23 engage in advocacy that acknowledge systemic racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ and other biases, as \n24 well as the very existence of transgender people, all of which are central to fulfillment of their \n25 missions. Plaintiffs do not know which of their activities are prohibited by the Executive Orders. \n26 Because of this uncertainty, they are justifiably fearful of conducting any activities that might \n27\n28\n  60   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 63 of 73\n \n \n1 threaten their direct or indirect federal funding, in spite of these activities’ centrality to their \n2 missions and ability to serve vulnerable and marginalized communities. \n3 263.  The Executive Orders violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to \n4 the Constitution and are void for vagueness because they infringe on Plaintiffs’ constitutionally-\n5 protected right to free speech and provide inadequate notice of the conduct they purport to prohibit.  \n6 264.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  the  Executive  Orders  are \n7 unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment. \n8 265.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \n9 the Agency Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Orders. \n10 COUNT III  \nUltra Vires Presidential Action in Excess of Authority \n11 Usurping the Legislative Function \n12\n266.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n13\nin paragraphs 1 through 265 as if fully set forth herein. \n14\n267.  All Plaintiffs state this cause of action against all Defendants (including President \n15\nTrump exclusively in his official capacity for purposes of declaratory relief), seek preliminary and \n16\npermanent injunctions, and challenge the Executive Orders and any agency action seeking to \n17\nimplement the Executive Orders both facially and as applied to them. \n18\n268.  Plaintiffs’ cause of action arises from the principle of non-statutory review to enjoin \n19\nExecutive Officers and Departments seeking to enforce illegal, ultra vires Presidential action.  \n20\n269.  The  U.S.  Constitution  vests  Congress,  not  the  President,  with  the  exclusive \n21\nauthority over federal spending under Article I, Section 8, and Article I, Section 9, Clause 7. \n22\nPresident Trump’s Executive Orders usurp this power by unilaterally terminating or modifying \n23\nfederal grants and contracts, despite no congressional authorization for such actions.  \n24\n270.  Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with the powers to make laws and \n25\ncontrol the public fisc. The Presentment Clause provides that “[e]very Bill which shall have passed \n26\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the \n27\nPresident of the United States.” U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7, cl. 2. The Appropriations Clause provides \n28\n  61   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 64 of 73\n \n \n1 that no “Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by \n2 Law,” U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7, and the Spending Clause vests Congress with the power to use \n3 Treasury funds for the “general Welfare of the United States.” U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n4 271.  Thus, it is Congress, not the President, who is vested with the power of the purse. \n5 The President does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously \n6 appropriated by Congress and signed into law, and the President does not have the power to impose \n7 his own conditions on the use of funds when Congress has not delegated to him the power to do \n8 so.  \n9 272.  As part of its power over the public fisc, Congress appropriates billions of dollars \n10 every year in social service, research, healthcare, and educational grants. Congress may specify \n11 how its grants are used, generally by passing statutes, or in the annual appropriations bill. None of \n12 the Congressional conditions placed on the grants administered or disbursed contain the unique \n13 restrictions  described  in  the  Executive  Orders  relating  to  “diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and \n14 accessibility,” or the promotion of “gender ideology.” \n15 273.  No provision of the U.S. Constitution authorizes the executive to enact, amend, or \n16 repeal statutes, including appropriations  approved by Congress and signed into law by the \n17 President. The executive cannot unilaterally amend or cancel appropriations that Congress has \n18 duly enacted.  \n19 274.  By directing agencies to terminate congressionally appropriated grants based on the \n20 President’s own policy preferences, the Executive Orders attempt to amend, repeal, rescind, or \n21 circumvent duly enacted federal statutes or appropriations. These mandates exceed the President’s \n22 powers under Article II, unconstitutionally infringe upon those powers vested in Congress, and \n23 attempt to amend federal legislation while bypassing Article I’s Bicameralism and Presentment \n24 Clauses. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3. \n25 275.  By directing agencies to terminate or withhold congressionally appropriated grants, \n26 the Executive Orders attempt to expend public funds to advance the President’s policy preferences, \n27\n28\n  62   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 65 of 73\n \n \n1 rather  than  those  of  Congress.  This  exceeds  the  President’s  powers  under  Article  II  and \n2 unconstitutionally infringes upon those powers vested in Congress. \n3 276.  These actions exceed the President’s powers under Article II, unconstitutionally \n4 infringe upon those powers vested in Congress, and attempt to amend federal legislation while \n5 bypassing Article I’s Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses. \n6 277.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  the  Executive  Orders  violate  the \n7 constitutional principles of the separation of powers doctrine, and impermissibly claim for the \n8 executive power that is reserved to Congress. \n9 278.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \n10 the Agency Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Orders.  \n11 COUNT IV  \nUltra Vires Presidential Action in Excess of Authority \n12 Contrary to Statutes \n13 279.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n14 in paragraphs 1 through 278 as if fully set forth herein. \n15 280.  All Plaintiffs state this cause of action against all Defendants (including President \n16 Trump exclusively in his official capacity for purposes of declaratory relief), seek preliminary and \n17 permanent injunctions, and challenge the Executive Orders and any agency action seeking to \n18 implement the Executive Orders both facially and as applied to them. \n19 281.  Plaintiffs’ cause of action arises from the principle of non-statutory review to enjoin \n20 Executive Officers and Departments seeking to enforce illegal, ultra vires Presidential action.  \n21 282.  Federal statutes and regulations specifically authorize Plaintiffs’ equity-related \n22 services  and  advocacy,  and  efforts  to  eradicate  discrimination  against  transgender  people. \n23 President Trump does not have the power to override those statutes and prohibit grant recipients \n24 from  doing  precisely  what  Congress  has  directed,  and  what  duly  promulgated  regulations \n25 prescribe. The Executive Orders are inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers \n26 clause.  \n27\n28\n  63   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 66 of 73\n \n \n1 283.  The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders impose sweeping funding restrictions on federal \n2 contractors and grantees, directing agencies to terminate “equity-related” grants and contracts \n3 without lawful statutory basis. These actions violate the constitutional separation of powers and \n4 amount to an unconstitutional exercise of executive authority over federal appropriations.  \n5 284.  The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders are contrary to funding statutes applicable to Plaintiffs \n6 who receive funding through the HIV Health Care Services Program (also known as the “Ryan \n7 White  Program”),  42  U.S.C.  §  300ff,  and  Housing  Opportunities  for  People  with  AIDS \n8 (“HOPWA”), 24 C.F.R. § 574.300.  \n9 285.  The  statutory  framework  for  the  Ryan  White  Program  constituted  the  initial \n10 national response to HIV and explicitly directs resources to underserved populations, reflecting \n11 Congress’s  intent  to  address  disparities  in  access  to  healthcare  for  individuals  living  with \n12 HIV/AIDS. The Ryan White Program requires grant recipients to create HIV health services \n13 planning councils that reflect the demographics of individuals with HIV/AIDS in a given area, \n14 with particular consideration for disproportionately affected and historically underserved groups \n15 and subpopulations. 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-12(b)(1). \n16 286.  The Ryan White Program also mandates that grant recipients target services to \n17 underserved  populations,  including  minority  populations,  ex-offenders,  individuals  with \n18 comorbidities, low-income populations, inner-city populations, and rural populations. 42 U.S.C. \n19 § 300ff-52. \n20 287.  The Ryan White Program established the Minority AIDS Initiative to evaluate and \n21 address racial and ethnic disparities in access to HIV care, with funding distributed based on the \n22 disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on racial and ethnic minorities. 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-121. \n23 288.  Likewise,  HOPWA  regulations  reinforce  the  prioritization  of  marginalized \n24 populations. HOPWA imposes affirmative outreach obligations on grantees to ensure all eligible \n25 individuals, including those at risk of discrimination based on race, national origin, sex, or \n26 disability, are aware of and can access HOPWA-funded housing and services. 24 C.F.R. § 574.603. \n27 Finally, the regulations explicitly define “family” in a manner inclusive of LGBTQ+ people, \n28\n  64   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 67 of 73\n \n \n1 ensuring access to housing assistance regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. 24 C.F.R. \n2 574.3.  \n3 289.  The statutory framework for FQHCs, which applies to Plaintiffs SF Health Center \n4 and LA LGBT Center, also mandates such organizations to provide medical care to “medically \n5 underserved populations” and specific minority groups facing systemic barriers to healthcare \n6 access. See 42 U.S.C. § 254b(a)(1). These populations include, but are not limited to, migratory \n7 and seasonal agricultural workers, individuals experiencing homelessness, and residents of public \n8 housing. Congress has further empowered states to determine medically underserved populations \n9 eligible for funding through 42 U.S.C. § 254b-1. \n10 290.  Congress  has  directly  appropriated  funds  for  specific  minority  populations, \n11 including grants for Pacific Islander health services and medical workforce development (see 42 \n12 U.S.C. § 254c-1), as well as funding for diabetes prevention programs targeted at Native American \n13 communities (see 42 U.S.C. § 254c-3). These statutory provisions demonstrate a clear legislative \n14 intent to allocate federal healthcare resources toward minority communities with documented \n15 medical disparities.  \n16 291.  The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders violate these statutory and regulatory mandates. The \n17 HOPWA, Ryan White, and FQHC programs are structured to remediate systemic inequities in \n18 healthcare and housing, and executive orders that disregard these obligations contradict the express \n19 will of Congress. \n20 292.  The Executive Orders also violate statutory and regulatory mandates applicable to \n21 organizations that provide healthcare services and receive any form of federal financial assistance, \n22 such as Plaintiff Health Centers. The Gender Order facially discriminates based on sex. For \n23 example, it directs agencies to withhold grants from entities that “promote gender ideology,” \n24 defined as acknowledging that a person’s gender identity may differ from their sex assigned at \n25 birth. The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders also restrict the ability of organizations to provide services in \n26 a manner that complies with accessibility requirements set forth in federal statutes. \n27\n28\n  65   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 68 of 73\n \n \n1 293.  Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. § 18116, provides \n2 that an individual shall not “be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \n3 subjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving \n4 Federal financial assistance” on the basis of race, national origin, sex, age, or disability. Section \n5 1908 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), 42 U.S.C. § 300w-7, similarly prohibits \n6 discrimination on the basis of sex in programs, services, and activities “receiving Federal financial \n7 assistance”  through  Preventive  Health  and  Health  Services  Block  Grants,  which  Defendant \n8 Kennedy allots as the Secretary of Defendant HHS. See 42 U.S.C. § 300w-1.  \n9 294.  Discrimination based on transgender status, including the failure to acknowledge a \n10 patient’s gender identity, constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex under Section 1557 of the \n11 ACA and Section 1908 of the PHSA.  \n12 295.  Section 1557 further requires that covered entities take reasonable steps to provide \n13 meaningful  access  to  its  health  programs  or  activities  to  individuals  with  limited  English \n14 proficiency or with disabilities. See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.201–92.205.  \n15 296.  Likewise, Section 1557 requires covered entities to train its employees as necessary \n16 and appropriate to carry out their functions consistent with the requirements of Section 1557 and \n17 its implementing regulations. See 45 C.F.R. § 92.9. \n18 297.  Federal law—passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President— \n19 prohibits medical institutions and healthcare entities receiving federal grants from discriminating \n20 based on race, national origin, sex, age, or disability as a condition of receiving federal financial \n21 assistance. The Gender Order attempts to override this statutory scheme with President Trump’s \n22 unilateral declaration that federally funded institutions must repudiate the existence of transgender \n23 people. The DEI-1 and DEI-2 Orders attempt to override this statutory scheme with President \n24 Trump’s unilateral declaration that federally funded institutions must not engage in efforts that \n25 promote “diversity, equity, inclusion, or accessibility.” \n26\n27\n28\n  66   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 69 of 73\n \n \n1 298.  President Trump does not have the power to override Section 1557 of the ACA or \n2 Section 1908 of the PHSA and require federal grantees to engage in precisely the discrimination \n3 that those laws prohibit.  \n4 299.  When  the  President  usurps  congressional  authority  and  infringes  on  the \n5 constitutional rights of individuals, the essential role of the courts is to “say what the law is.” The \n6 Executive Orders should be declared unlawful, and the Agency Defendants should be enjoined \n7 from enforcing or implementing them. \n8 300.  Federal statutes and regulations specifically authorize Plaintiffs’ equity-related \n9 services and advocacy, and their efforts to eradicate discrimination against transgender people. \n10 President Trump does not have the power to override those statutes and prohibit grant recipients \n11 from  doing  precisely  what  Congress  has  directed,  and  what  duly  promulgated  regulations \n12 prescribe. The Executive Orders are inconsistent with the Constitution’s separation of powers \n13 clause. \n14 301.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the DEI-1, DEI-2, and Gender Orders are \n15 ultra vires because they impermissibly direct agencies to take actions in violation of statutory laws.  \n16 302.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \n17 the Agency Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Orders.  \n18 COUNT V  \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment \n19 Equal Protection \n20 303.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n21 in paragraphs 1 through 302 as if fully set forth herein. \n22 304.  All Plaintiffs state this cause of action against all Defendants (including President \n23 Trump exclusively in his official capacity for purposes of declaratory relief), seek preliminary and \n24 permanent  injunctions,  and  challenge  the  Gender  Order  and  any  agency  action  seeking  to \n25 implement it both facially and as applied to them. \n26 305.  Plaintiffs’ cause of action arises from the principle of non-statutory review to enjoin \n27 Executive Officers and Departments seeking to enforce illegal, ultra vires Presidential action.  \n28\n  67   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 70 of 73\n \n \n1 306.  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that no person \n2 shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  \n3 307.  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause makes the Fourteenth Amendment’s \n4 guarantee of equal protection applicable to the federal government, its agencies, its officials, and \n5 its employees.  \n6 308.  The Gender Order discriminates against Plaintiffs based on sex and transgender \n7 status by depriving them of funding because they serve and advocate for an end to discrimination \n8 against transgender people.  \n9 309.  The Gender Order also discriminates based on sex and transgender status against \n10 the transgender people whom Plaintiffs serve. Plaintiffs assert claims on their own behalf and also \n11 on behalf of the people they serve, including patients, clients, and the patrons who visit the GLBT \n12 Historical Society to learn about their community’s past. These patients, clients and patrons face \n13 barriers to asserting their own claims and protecting their own interests.  \n14 A.  The Gender Order is Motivated by Animus.  \n15 310.  The Gender Order expressly discriminates based on transgender status on its face \n16 by  expressing  a  disparaging,  demeaning,  idiosyncratic,  and  unscientific  viewpoint  about \n17 transgender people; repudiating the very existence of people who are transgender, deeming them \n18 “false”; and ordering their exclusion from government recognition and protection in every aspect \n19 of their daily lives, from identification documents to healthcare, housing, and employment, among \n20 other elements.  \n21 311.  The Gender Order was issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of expressing \n22 governmental disapproval of transgender people and rendering them unequal to others. It is a \n23 status-based classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something the Constitution’s \n24 Equal Protection Clause does not permit. \n25 312.  Thus, the Gender Order imposes a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single \n26 named group: transgender people. Its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered \n27 for it that the Gender Order is inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.  \n28\n  68   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 71 of 73\n \n \n1 313.  This animus-laden purpose is not a legitimate governmental interest and fails under \n2 any standard of review.  \n3 314.  Laws that target and discriminate against a class of people for the sole purpose of \n4 making them unequal violate equal protection.  \n5 B.  The Gender Order Discriminates Based on Sex and Transgender Status.  \n6 315.  The Gender Order facially creates a classification based on transgender status by \n7 repudiating  the  existence  of  transgender  people,  deeming  them  “false,”  and  ordering  their \n8 exclusion from government recognition and protection in numerous aspects of their lives. \n9 316.  The Gender Order also facially creates a classification based on sex because it \n10 creates idiosyncratic and unscientific sex-based definitions for the purpose of exclusion and directs \n11 agencies to withhold grants from entities that “promote gender ideology.” \n12 317.  Discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  and  transgender  status  is  presumptively \n13 unconstitutional and subject to heightened scrutiny.  \n14 318.  The Gender Order lacks even a rational or legitimate justification, let alone the \n15 exceedingly persuasive or compelling one that is constitutionally required.  \n16 319.  The Gender Order also lacks adequate tailoring under any standard of review. \n17 320.  The Trump Administration has been clear that its goal is to erase the transgender \n18 community from participation in society—an effort that results in the literal denial of equal \n19 protection and causes ongoing harm to the Plaintiffs and the people that they serve.  \n20 321.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Gender Order violates the equal \n21 protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  \n22 322.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \n23 the Agency Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Gender Order.  \n24\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n25\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs seek judgment against the Defendants for: \n26\na.  A declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) that the Executive Orders and \n27\ntheir implementing agency actions are unlawful and unconstitutional; \n28\n  69   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01824     Document 1     Filed 02/20/25     Page 72 of 73\n \n \n1 b.  Preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  enjoining  Agency  Defendants  from \n2 implementing and enforcing the Executive Orders; \n3 c.  Costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as permitted by law; and \n4 d.  Such further relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.  \n5 Dated this 20th of February, 2025.
