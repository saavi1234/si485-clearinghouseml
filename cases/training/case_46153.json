    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump administration&rsquo;s reversal of previously approved federal emergency shelter funding to the City of New York and the termination of the underlying grant program.</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, 2025, the City of New York filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against President Donald Trump, FEMA, DHS, the Treasury Department, and associated officials.&nbsp;The case was assigned to Judge Jennifer H. Rearden.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit arose out of FEMA&rsquo;s Shelter and Services Program (SSP), a congressionally funded program that reimburses local governments and nonprofits for sheltering and assisting noncitizen migrants released from DHS custody. After the City received $80.5 million in FEMA-approved SSP reimbursements on February 4, the funds were unilaterally clawed back from the City&rsquo;s account via an ACH reversal on February 11. The complaint referred to this as the &ldquo;money grab.&rdquo; The plaintiff alleged that this action, along with FEMA&rsquo;s subsequent termination of the program and retroactive justification via a &ldquo;Remedy for Noncompliance Letter,&rdquo; violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Due Process Clause, the Spending Clause, and the separation of powers.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint asserted that FEMA had thoroughly reviewed and approved the City&rsquo;s expenditures&mdash;including detailed data on individual migrants released by DHS&mdash;before disbursing funds. Plaintiffs argued the clawback violated grant regulations, ACH reversal rules, and constitutional limits on executive power. The suit further alleges that FEMA&rsquo;s suspension and later termination of SSP were pretextual and driven by political opposition to the program&rsquo;s purpose. The Trump administration&rsquo;s actions were reportedly orchestrated with or directed by the White House&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and top officials including Elon Musk and Kristi Noem, whose social media posts allegedly announced or celebrated the clawback and the defunding of migrant assistance programs.</p>\r\n<p>The City initially moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to require FEMA to return the funds. The court denied the TRO on March 7, holding that the City had not shown irreparable harm because the funds remained &ldquo;obligated.&rdquo; However, the City&rsquo;s amended and second amended complaints argued that those funds had already been zeroed out in federal grant databases and could not be recovered absent judicial intervention.</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, the government responded to the second amended complaint by moving to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs responded in opposition to this motion on August 25.</p>\r\n<p>In a letter submitted on October 8, plaintiffs flagged a recent decision from the Governmental Accountability Office that they requested be considered by the court. The plaintiffs claim that the new agency decision offers informative findings on the arbitrary and capricious nature of FEMA grant recessions that support a denial of the defendant's motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>The case remains ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenged the Trump administration’s clawback of $80.5 million in emergency shelter funding previously awarded to New York City under FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program (SSP). On February 21, 2025, the City sued in the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of the APA, Spending Clause, Due Process, and separation of powers. The court denied a TRO, and the City later filed amended complaints detailing the ACH reversal, program termination, and political motivations behind the defunding. As of July 2025, the case remained ongoing.",

The answer is plainly no.  \nThis case presents no emergency and does not warrant an extraordinary remedy.  Rather, it involves \nthe simple issue of an agency—pursuant to applicable regulations and the governing instruments—\ntemporarily withholding funding from a grantee and acting to reverse an unauthorized payment.  \nThat the latter action resulted in approximately $80 million being transferred from the plaintiff in \nthis case, the City of New York, to its rightful holder, the federal government, does not an \nemergency make.   \nIndeed, that money was a reimbursement for expenditures that Plaintiff has already \nincurred and under fundamental principles of appropriations law, there is no realistic probability \nthat the money will be unavailable to be disbursed to Plaintiff at the conclusion of this lawsuit in \nthe event the city ultimately prevails, so there is no harm here.  And in any event the proper venue \n \n1 https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/20/2025-02873/foreign-terrorist-organization-designations-of-\ntren-de-aragua-mara-salvatrucha-cartel-de-sinaloa. \n2 https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/1st-migrant-flight-heads-guantanamo-bay-carrying-worst/story?id=118456073; \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/americas/venezuelan-migrants-deported-guantanamo-bay-intl-hnk/index.html.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 9 of 35\nfor any claim to reimbursement Plaintiff has is in the Court of Federal Claims.  For now, though, \nthe only question is where the $80 million needs to reside for the duration of this case.  Because \nthe answer to that question is plainly not with the Plaintiff, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion \nfor a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. \n  Plaintiff’s fundamental inability to demonstrate irreparable harm is not its only problem.  \nPlaintiff also fails to present a ripe dispute.  Indeed, it challenged a preliminary agency decision \nfrom the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) that only pauses its receipt of the \nfederal grant funds at issue in this lawsuit—not the kind of final agency action that is reviewable \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  Plaintiff also seeks a mandatory injunction that \nwould provide them with the ultimate relief they seek—the return of the money at issue.  That kind \nof request is subject to a heightened standard, and Plaintiff does not show it has a clear and \nsubstantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits.  At bottom, Plaintiff’s claims fail for the central \nreason that FEMA has the authority to take the actions that Plaintiff challenges in this lawsuit, \nincluding reversing an erroneous payment of federal grant funds, while it looks into whether a \nrelease of those funds would be facilitating illegal activities in violation of the terms of the grant.   \n  The Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion. \nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  The Shelter and Services Program. \n \nIn 2023 and 2024, Congress appropriated funds to the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”) “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities, including \nfacility improvements and construction, in support of relieving overcrowding in short-term holding \nfacilities of [CBP].”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, Div. \nF, 16 Stat. 4459, 4730 (2022); see Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 10 of 35\n118-47, Div. C, 138 Stat. 460, 598 (2024) (similar language).  As FEMA has explained, this \n“Shelter and Services Program,” or “SSP,” “makes available federal funds to eligible recipients \nand  subrecipients  for  costs  associated  with  providing  shelter  and  other  eligible  services  to \nnoncitizens migrants who have been encountered and released by DHS.”  Ex. 1 at 6, ECF No. 9-\n1.  And as DHS has further explained, these grants were a part of the Department’s overall “efforts \nto manage and secure our borders in a safe, orderly, and humane way[, which] include support for \ncommunities.”3  The federal government, through these grants, provided financial assistance to the \ngrantees for certain services, and that agreement—funding for services—was memorialized in a \ngrant agreement. \nLike most federal grant funds, SSP grants are subject to the recipient’s acceptance of certain \nterms and conditions.  In soliciting applicants for SSP funds, FEMA made clear that all such \napplicants “agree to comply with the requirements of this [Notice of Funding Opportunity] and the \nterms and conditions of the award.”  E.g., Ex. 2 at 21, ECF 9-2 at 21; see also Ex. 2  at 37, ECF \nNo. 9-2 (requiring that recipients “accept all conditions in this [Notice of Funding Opportunity] as \nwell as any specific terms and conditions in the Notice of Award to receive an award under this \nprogram”).  SSP grant recipients must generally provide “financial and programmatic reports as a \ncondition of award acceptance,” id. at 41, submit to regular monitoring and oversight, id. at 46-48, \nand comply with various audit requirements, id. at 65-67.  And they agree that funds made \navailable through an SSP award “may be used for the purposes set forth in this [Notice of Funding \nOpportunity] and the terms and conditions of the award and must be consistent with the statutory \nauthority for the award.”  Id. at 30.  A grant by the United States upon conditions, and the \nacceptance of that grant by the recipient, constitutes a contract.  See McGee vs. Mathis, 71 U.S. \n \n3 https://www.dhs.gov/archive/news/2024/04/12/department-homeland-security-announces-300-million-direct-\nfunding-communities. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 11 of 35\n143, 154 (1866); cf. Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, 146 (2023) (standing for the \nproposition that old law is still law).  In accepting those federal funds, the City agreed to abide by \nthe conditions of the grant.  See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981).  And the federal government received something of value—the City agreed to house aliens \nwho DHS would otherwise detain under the immigration laws, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), allowing \nDHS  to  then  more  efficiently  use  its  limited  resources  to  satisfy  its  obligations  under  the \nimmigration laws. \nThe grants are also made subject to DHS Standard Terms and Conditions, which require \ncompliance  with  the  Uniform  Administrative  Requirements,  Cost  Principles,  and  Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards.  Id.; see 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (adopted by DHS at 2 C.F.R. \n§ 3002.10).  Those regulations require agencies administering all federal award programs—\nincluding  SSP—to  “ensure  that  Federal  funding  is  expended  and  associated  programs  are \nimplemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable statutes and regulations . . . \nand the requirements of [2 C.F.R. Part 200].”  2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a); see also id. § 200.303(b) \n(requiring grant recipients to “[c]omply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, \nand the terms and conditions of the Federal award”).  They also require recipients to retain records \nrelevant to the federal award and make them available to the administering agency; and they \nestablish a broad set of remedies that the agency can take in the event of noncompliance “with the \nU.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award,” id. \n§ 200.339(a), including terminating the federal award, temporarily withholding funds, disallowing \ncosts, and pursuing other legally available remedies.  See id. §§ 200.339-200.343.  As explained \nin the relevant notices of funding opportunities, in the event of noncompliance, FEMA may initiate \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 12 of 35\nactions to “disallow costs” and “recover funds,” including recovering any “improper payments.”  \nEx. 2 at 64-65, ECF No. 9-2. \nII.  The Roosevelt Hotel \n“A substantial portion of SSP money paid to New York City goes to funding alien housing \nat the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City,” by way of a contract with the nonprofit New York City \nHealth and hospital Corporation.  Decl. of Cameron Hamilton, Senior Official Performing the \nDuties of the FEMA Administrator ¶ 6 (“Hamilton Decl.,” attached hereto as Ex. A).  According \nto media reports, Tren De Aragua has “taken over the Roosevelt Hotel and is using it as a recruiting \ncenter and base of operations to plan a variety of crimes,” including “gun and drug sales as well \nas sex trafficking, which can reasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself.”  Id.  And \n“the alien who murdered Laken Riley stayed at this hotel.”  Id. \nIn addition there are “criminal investigations into many of these activities” at the Roosevelt \nHotel, but the “details are law enforcement sensitive and should not be shared in a public \ndeclaration.”  Id. ¶ 7. \nIII.  Plaintiff’s Award and FEMA’s Temporary Withholding of Funds. \nPlaintiff applied for and received SSP funding for both Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year \n2024.  See Pl.’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. & TRO at 3-4, ECF No. 10 (“PI \nMem.”).  For 2024, FEMA approved Plaintiff for two different awards, one for $59,302,125.07, \nEx. 12 at 1, ECF No. 9-12, and the other for $22,169,838, Ex. 13 at 1, ECF No. 9-13, totaling \n$81.4 million.  Both awards incorporate the terms of the Notices of Funding Opportunities through \nwhich Plaintiff applied and set forth standard “agreement articles,” which, among other things, \nreaffirm the requirement that Plaintiff comply with federal grant regulations, provide DHS access \nto records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff, and cooperate  with DHS \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 13 of 35\ncompliance reviews and investigations.  See Ex. 12 at 15, ECF No. 9-12; Ex. 13 at 14, ECF No. 9-\n13.   \nSince being sworn in on January 25, 2025, the Secretary of Homeland Security has issued \nmultiple directives addressing the agency’s spending—including awards made through grant \nprograms—to “ensure that payments made by the Department are consistent with law and do not \npromote fraud, waste, or abuse.”  See Hamilton Decl. ¶ 2.  Relevant to the SSP program, the \nSecretary issued a memorandum on January 28, 2025 placing “on hold pending review” all grant \ndisbursements  for  which  “non-profit  organizations  are  eligible”  and  “touch  in  any  way  on \nimmigration.”  See Memorandum from the Secretary for Component and Office Heads re: \nDirection on Grants to Non-governmental Organizations (“Memorandum”) (Jan. 28, 2025) (Ex. 1 \nto Hamilton Decl.).4 \nNotwithstanding the above, on February 4, 2025, FEMA made two payments, via United \nStates  Department  of  the  Treasury  (“Treasury”)  direct  deposit  in  a  combined  amount  of \napproximately $80.4 million for these awards.5  See Hamilton Decl. ¶ 5.  These payments were \nmade “in error because FEMA was under the misunderstanding” that they were allowed under the \nterms of the Memorandum.  Id. ¶ 9.  But because that Memorandum placed a hold on DHS grants \nand assessments that “go to non-profit organizations or for which non-profits are eligible” and \n“touch in anyway on immigration,” id. (emphasis added), and non-profits are eligible for SSP \ngrants, FEMA’s understanding at the time it made the payment was “incorrect” and it “did not have \n \n4 As Plaintiff notes, the federal government submitted similar materials related to SSP funds in litigation challenging \na broader temporary pause on government spending.  Although the court in that case denied the government’s motion \nfor permission to continue withholding SSP funds, that denial was only because such permission was not needed from \nthe court because the hold on SSP funding was based on “the applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms” \nand beyond the scope of the temporary restraining order entered in that case.  Order at 3-4, New York v. Trump, 1:25-\ncv-39-JJM (D.R.I. Feb. 12, 2025), ECF No. 107.  \n5 The payment on February 5 covered most, but not all, of the $81.4 million fiscal year 2024 grant award, as \napproximately $1 million remained unreimbursed. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 14 of 35\nthe authorization to make the payment.”  Id.  DHS also “had significant concerns that SSP funding \nwas going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities” that were subject to criminal \ninvestigation.  Id. ¶ 10.  Accordingly, FEMA’s Acting Chief Financial Officer “contacted the \nTreasury by telephone to inform them of the mistaken, improper payment and request assistance.”  \nId. ¶ 11.  After “certifying by phone that the payment was improper, FEMA submitted to Treasury \nan Improper Recovery Request via the Treasury Check Information System to recover the payment \npursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 210.6(f).”  Id.  Treasury then “processed this request and returned the \npayment to FEMA as a Treasury cancellation.”  Id. ¶ 11. \nOn February 18, 2025, FEMA issued a “Remedy for Noncompliance Letter” regarding \nNew York’s SSP awards for both fiscal years 2023 and 2024.  See Ex. 4 to Hamilton Decl. \n(“Noncompliance Letter”).  The letter notified New York that FEMA would be “temporarily \nwithholding payments” for its prior grant awards, that it had already recovered its two most recent \npayments (totaling approximately $80.4 million on February 7, 2025), and that going forward it \nwould also be instituting “specific conditions” on the grant award pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.208.  \nId. at 1.  FEMA based these actions on “significant concerns that SSP funding is going to entities \nengaged in or facilitating illegal activities,” providing the example of a hotel and SSP facility in \nNew York City that is reportedly being used as a “recruiting center and base of operations” for a \ngang to “plan a variety of crimes,” including some that can “reasonably be presumed to be \nconducted in the hotel itself.”  Id. at 1-2.  FEMA further stated its concern that entities receiving \npayments pursuant to New York’s SSP program may be violating immigration laws.  Id. at 2 (citing \n8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A) and applicable conspiracy, aiding or abetting, and attempt prohibitions). \n  To ensure compliance going forward, and while it continues to temporarily withhold funds, \nFEMA stated that it would conduct additional monitoring and review of New York’s award and \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 15 of 35\nrequested that New York submit additional information regarding the aliens serviced through New \nYork’s SSP award.  Id. at 2.  FEMA also notified New York of its right to appeal the Noncompliance \nLetter and encouraged it to submit a written explanation of its position and any supporting \ndocuments or statements.  Id. \nIV.  This Lawsuit. \nPlaintiff, the City of New York initiated this lawsuit on February 21, 2025, see Compl., \nECF No. 1, and that same day moved for both a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction.  See ECF Nos., 3, 5, 10.  Asserting claims pursuant to the APA, Due Process Clause, \nSpending Clause, and Separation of Powers, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants \nto return the $80 million that FEMA canceled and preventing Defendants from recovering any \nfurther funds issued for the 2023 and 2024 awards. \nOn February 24, 2025, the Court ordered Defendants to respond to Plaintiff’s motion for \nemergency relief by February 28 at 4:00 p.m. and set a hearing for March 5 at 12:15 p.m. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n \n  “The standard[s] for granting a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction . \n. . are identical.”  Sterling v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co., 368 F. Supp. 3d 723, 726-27 (S.D.N.Y. \n2019).  “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.”  Id. at 20. \n  As Plaintiff acknowledges, because it seeks a mandatory injunction that would disrupt the \nstatus quo, its request for emergency relief must “meet a heightened legal standard by showing a \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 16 of 35\nclear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits.”  N. Am. Soccer League, LLC v. U.S. Soccer \nFed’n, Inc., 883 F.3d 32, 37 (2d Cir. 2018) (quotation omitted).  Plaintiff also must make a “strong \nshowing” of irreparable harm.  New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 650 \n(2d Cir. 2015).  Similarly, because the purpose of a preliminary injunction is “not to award the \nmovant the ultimate relief sought in the suit but is only to preserve the status quo,” City of \nNewburgh v. Sarna, 690 F. Supp. 2d 136, 175 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (quotation omitted), “[p]reliminary \ninjunction relief is improper where it would give the plaintiff substantially all the ultimate relief it \nseeks,” Holy Spirit Ass’n for the Unification of World Christianity v. Town of New Castle, 480 F. \nSupp. 1212, 1214 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Emergency Relief Is Not Warranted Because Plaintiff Makes No Showing, Much Less \na Strong Showing, of Irreparable Harm. \nPlaintiff has failed to “demonstrate that . . . irreparable injury that is neither remote nor \nspeculative, but actual and imminent.”  Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d \nCir. 2005) (internal quotations omitted).  Plaintiff speculates it will suffer irreparable injury \nwithout emergency injunctive relief because the funds at issue “may be exhausted, lapse, or be \nrescinded before this action is decided.”  See PI Mem. at 19.  That claim lacks merit and conflicts \nwith longstanding appropriations principles. \nFirst, the Purpose Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), prevents the funds at issue from being spent \non anything other than “the objects for which the appropriations were made.” 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a).  \nTherefore, DHS cannot spend the money at issue on anything other than “support[ing] sheltering \nand related activities provided by non-Federal entities, in support of relieving overcrowding in \nshort-term holding facilities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.”  See Pub. L. No. 118-47, \nTitle II, 138 Stat. at 598.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 17 of 35\nSecond, the funds DHS obligated to Plaintiff cannot be re-obligated to another entity or \npotential grantee.  The $80.4 million that Plaintiff seeks was appropriated in fiscal year 2024 \npursuant to DHS’s annual appropriations act.  See id.  Congress generally limits the availability of \nappropriations to a one-year period for the fiscal year in which the funds are appropriated, unless \nit specifies otherwise.  See 31 U.S.C. § 1301(c).  The imposition of time limits on appropriations \nis one of the primary ways Congress exercises control over its Appropriations Clause power.  A \ntime-limited appropriation is thus available to incur a new obligation only during the period of \ntime designated by Congress.  See id. § 1502(a) (stating that “[t]he balance of an appropriation or \nfund limited for obligation to a definite period is available only for payment of expenses properly \nincurred during the period of availability”).   \nHere, Congress stated that the funds would be available for obligation only “for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2024.”  See id., Pub. L. No. 118-147, § 5, 138 Stat. at 461.  Acting \npursuant to this appropriations authority, FEMA obligated $81.4 million to the City through a \nseries of awards during fiscal year 2024.  See ECF No. 9-10 at 23, ECF No. 9-12 at 23, 9-13 at 24 \n(“Obligating Document”).6  Because the time to obligate the funds expired on September 30, 2024, \nDHS cannot re-award those funds to another entity or potential grantee.  See Cnty. of Westchester \nv. U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 802 F.3d 413, 417 n.10 (2d Cir. 2015) (stating that expired \nfunds “may not be reallocated to other jurisdictions” because of the statutory restriction on new \nobligations); see also Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations \nLaw at 5-6 (4th ed., 2016 rev.) (“This rule—that time-limited budget authority ceases to be \navailable for incurring new obligations after the last day of the specified time period—has been \n \n6 An obligation is a commitment by a federal agency, such as entering into a contract, “that creates a legal liability of \nthe government for the payment of goods and services ordered or received . . . . ”  Maine Cmty. Health Options v. \nUnited States, 590 U.S. 296, 308 (2020) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 18 of 35\ntermed an ‘elementary principle’ of federal fiscal law.”) (quoting City of Houston, Texas v. \nDepartment of Housing & Urban Development, 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). \nThird, even though the funds at issue are not available for new obligations, DHS retains \nstatutory authority until 2029 to disburse the obligated funds to Plaintiff.  With respect to the \ndisbursement of funds that have been obligated to a recipient, time-limited appropriations remain \navailable for an additional five fiscal years beyond their obligation period “for recording, adjusting, \nand liquidating obligations properly chargeable” to the appropriation.  31 U.S.C. § 1553(a); see 31 \nU.S.C. § 1552(a) (“On September 30th of the 5th fiscal year after the period of availability for \nobligation of a fixed appropriation account ends, the account shall be closed and any remaining \nbalance (whether obligated or unobligated) in the account shall be canceled and thereafter shall \nnot be available for obligation or expenditure for any purpose”).  Because the funds at issue were \nobligated to Plaintiff during the one-year statutory obligation window, DHS has five additional \nyears—until September 30, 2029—to disburse the challenged funds to Plaintiff.  See Westchester \nv. U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 778 F.3d 412, 417 n.8 (2d Cir. 2015) (concluding that a case \nwas not moot even though the obligation period for challenged funds had expired because the \nagency had five additional years to pay its obligations).  Five years is more than enough time \nresolve Plaintiff’s claim to the funds without risk that the money will become unavailable during \nthe pendency of this case. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff misses the mark by relying on City of Houston v. Department \nof Housing & Urban Development, 24 F.3d 1421 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  See PI Mem. at 19-20.  There, \nthe D.C. Circuit held that the City of Houston’s claim to certain grant funds was “moot on two \nindependent grounds.”  24 F.3d at 1427.  The agency had already obligated certain funds to other \ngrantees and the period of obligation for other funds that Houston claimed had expired before \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 19 of 35\nHouston filed suit, such that the Court was powerless to override Congress’s statutory limitation \non the available obligation period.  See id. at 1426-27; see also Cnty. of Suffolk v. Sebelius, 605 \nF.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir. 2010) (discussing City of Houston).  Neither of those circumstances is \npresent here.  The funds at issue have already been obligated to the City within the one-year \nstatutory period of availability; this case is not a situation where multiple grantees are fighting over \nthe same limited pot of money.  Thus the dispute here is over disbursement of the funds, which \ncan be litigated in the normal course because of the 5-year liquidation period.  Unlike City of \nHouston and the other D.C. Circuit cases cited in Plaintiff’s brief, this case does not involve a \ndispute over unobligated funds approaching their statutory expiration period.  Accordingly, there \nis no danger of this case becoming moot in the near future.  As the Second Circuit recognized in \nWestchester,  a  court  does  not  need  to  “expeditiously”  resolve  a  case  challenging  a  party’s \nentitlement to expired funds where those funds will remain available to pay the clamant for an \nadditional 5 years after the conclusion of the obligation period.  See Cnty. of Westchester., 802 F.3d \nat 417 n.10. \nAdditionally, the Court should reject Plaintiff’s argument that immediate relief is needed \nbecause Congress might “rescind the appropriation” from which Plaintiff would be paid.  See PI \nMem. at 20.  Speculation that Congress might enact a law at some point in the future that might \nadversely impact Plaintiff’s financial interests is not the type of “actual and imminent” harm that \ncan provide a basis for the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order or preliminary \ninjunction.  Freedom Holdings, Inc., 408 F.3d at 114.  In any event, Plaintiff provides no authority \nfor its novel position that the Court can override Congress’s Appropriations Power or insulate \nPlaintiff from the effect of future legislation through ex ante temporary injunctive relief. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 20 of 35\nPlaintiffs also cannot establish irreparable injury based on speculation that DHS will \nattempt at some point in the future attempt to claw back funds previously paid to Plaintiff under \nthe fiscal year 2023 grant award.  See PI Mem. at 21.  As explained above, the recent recoupment \nof the $80.4 million in fiscal year 2024 funds was the result of an erroneous payment that Plaintiff \ncannot establish that is likely to recur again.  See Hamilton Decl. ¶¶ 9-11.  Protective injunctive \nrelief is not available in circumstances such as this one where the plaintiff cannot show “a sufficient \nlikelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.”  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 \nU.S. 95, 111 (1983) (holding prospective relief unavailable based on mere speculation of future \ninjury”). \nIn any event, were DHS to attempt to claw back funds already paid to Plaintiff for \nnoncompliance under the grant award, DHS would be required to follow the process outlined in 2 \nC.F.R. §§ 200.339 – 200.343, which requires notice and an opportunity for the grant recipient to \nobject in writing and provide information challenging DHS’s actions.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.342. \nIndeed, FEMA’s non-compliance letter expressly referenced these provisions and noted Plaintiff’s \nright to appeal.  See Noncompliance Letter.  Accordingly, there is no basis for the Court to enjoin \nDHS from undertaking this process by issuing an overbroad temporary restraining order that would \nprohibit DHS from following lawful procedures to recoup funds from Plaintiff if appropriate.   \nIn sum, Plaintiff has not carried its burden to show that the disputed funds at issue in the \ncase must be returned immediately to prevent irreparable injury.  This case can be litigated on a \nnormal schedule without the need for emergency injunctive relief. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 21 of 35\nII.  Plaintiff Is Not Substantially Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nA.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Not Cognizable Under The APA. \nTo start, Plaintiff attempts to convert what is clearly a dispute for money damages into an \nAPA claim.  But a suit for money damages cannot be brought under the APA—such a claim against \nthe federal government is cognizable solely under the Tucker Act.  The Tucker Act provides the \nCourt of Federal Claims with jurisdiction over claims against the United States founded, inter alia, \non an express or implied contract with the United States. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).   To establish a \ncontract under the Tucker Act, a claimant must prove four elements: (1) lack of ambiguity in offer \nand acceptance; (2) mutuality of intent to contract; (3) sufficient conduct by a government \nrepresentative  having  actual  authority  to  bind  the  government  in  contract;  and  (4) \nconsideration. Nevin v. United States, 43 Fed. Cl. 151 (1999).  Here, Plaintiff clearly seeks to \nenforce an agreement that satisfies these elements. \nAs discussed above, the four corners of the grant agreement clearly meet the first three \nprongs of the test.  And the parties both provided consideration for the agreement.  Plaintiff, of \ncourse, receives funding and support for a population who the City would otherwise be obligated \nto utilize City funds to house.  See Plotnick v. City of New York, 539 N.Y.S.2d 395 (2d Dep't 1989) \n(“The City of New York is mandated by law and by consent decree to provide housing to every \nhomeless family and individual who so requests.”); Callahan v. Carey, N.Y.L.J. Dec. 11, 1979, at \n10 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Dec. 11, 1979).  In exchange, the City commits to providing specific services \npursuant to the federal government’s terms and for the benefit of the federal government.  The \nstatutory default for this population is detention, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), and providing housing offered \nan alternative that was consistent with the policies of the prior Administration.  Moreover, those \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 22 of 35\npolicies caused a significant increase in the alien population in New York, and providing federally \nfunded housing in New York facilitated the Administration continuation of those border policies. \nB.  Plaintiff Does Not Challenge Final Agency Action. \nPlaintiff cannot show a clear likelihood of success on the merits for the threshold reason \nthat its claims are not reviewable at all.  Judicial review under the APA is proper only where there \nis a “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy.”  5 U.S.C. § 704; see Larson \nv. United States, 888 F.3d 578, 587 (2d Cir. 2018) (“APA review is limited to [ ] final agency \naction.”).  For an agency action to be “final,” two conditions must be met.  First, “the action must \nmark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process—it must not be of a merely \ntentative or interlocutory nature.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  Second, “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  The \nfinal agency action requirement “not only allows the agency to apply its expertise in developing a \nfactual record, but also promotes efficiency by allowing the administrative proceedings to be \ncompleted without premature interruption.  Moreover, the need for judicial review may be obviated \neither by a factual determination or by the exercise of agency discretion.” Am. Cyanamid Co. v. \nRoudebush, 411 F. Supp. 1220, 1222 (S.D.N.Y. 1976). \nHere, there is no “final agency action” because Defendants have not yet made a final \ndecision to withhold payments from Plaintiff on a permanent basis or take any other adverse action \nagainst it.  Rather, in light of Defendants’ concerns about Plaintiff’s potential noncompliance with \nits grants, Defendants will “conduct additional monitoring and review” of Plaintiff’s awards.  \nNoncompliance Letter at 2.  “During this time, payments under the grant award(s) will be \ntemporarily held,” including the approximately $80 million payment that, as discussed above, was \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 23 of 35\nerroneously disbursed.  Id. (emphasis added).  To assist Defendants’ monitoring, Plaintiff has 30 \ndays to provide certain information to FEMA.  Noncompliance Letter at 2.  “Upon the conclusion \nof that monitoring, FEMA will notify you of the results and any other remedies for noncompliance \nor specific conditions, as appropriate.” Id. at 3 (emphasis added).  These passages demonstrate that \nthe Noncompliance Letter is an initial step in FEMA’s decisionmaking process—as confirmed by \nthe fact that Plaintiff has the ability to appeal the decision within the agency.  See id. (“Your \norganization has the right to appeal this action within 60 days of the date of this letter.”).  \nTo the extent that Plaintiff asserts independent constitutional claims that do not rely on the \nAPA’s cause of action, those claims are similarly unripe.  See Abbot Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. \n136, 148-49 (1967) (stating that the ripeness requirement “protect[s] the agencies from judicial \ninterference until an administrative decision has been formalized”); Seafarers Int’l Union of N. \nAm., AFL-CIO v. U.S. Coast Guard, 736 F.2d 19, 26 (2d Cir. 1984) (“The law of ripeness is now \nvery much a matter of common sense, whether one speaks in the related terms of “ripeness,” of \nsatisfying the “final agency action” requirement of the APA, or of the exhaustion requirement \nimplicit in the APA.  What these doctrines require, however they may be put, is a determination \nthat there is a justiciable case or controversy within the prudential rules by which we are \ngoverned.” (citations omitted)). \nC.  Plaintiff’s APA and Due Process Claims Are Not Likely to Succeed. \nIn its emergency motion briefing, Plaintiff presses a grab bag of APA claims, contending \nthat the Noncompliance Letter is “arbitrary and capricious,” an “abuse of discretion,” “contrary to \nlaw,” and without “adherence to ‘procedure required by law.’”  See PI Mem. at 11-16.  Plaintiff \nfurther argues that FEMA’s alleged procedural violation “also violates the Due Process Clause.”  \nId. at 16.  These arguments all mischaracterize the nature of the agency’s action reversing its \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 24 of 35\nerroneous $80.4 million payment.  And they all fail for the same reason: FEMA is entitled to \nrecover improper payments, temporarily withhold funds, and impose specific conditions based on \na recipient’s noncompliance with the terms of the grant and/or federal law. \nContrary to law (PI Mem. at 14-15) \nPlaintiff’s central contention is that “Defendants have no legal authority to grab back SSP \nfunds from the City.”  PI Mem. at 14.  But Plaintiff does not appear to dispute DHS’s general \nauthority  to  withhold  (and  recover  improper)  payments  from  grant  recipients  based  on \nnoncompliance with federal law.  Nor could it: the authority of federal agencies to do so is well \nestablished in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements \nfor Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. Part 200, which as discussed above broadly recognize agency \nauthority to withhold, terminate, suspend, disallow, or recover federal funding.  See 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.339; 2 C.F.R. § 200.345(a)(1) (providing that the closeout of a Federal award does not affect \nthe “right of the Federal agency . . . to disallow costs and recover funds”).  The Notices of Funding \nOpportunities, the terms of which Plaintiff has agreed to abide by, confirms this: they state that if \nan award recipient is in noncompliance with, among other things, “applicable federal statutes,” the \nagency can “take other remedies,” including “actions to disallow costs, recover funds, wholly or \npartly suspend or terminate the award, initiate suspension and debarment proceedings, withhold \nfurther federal awards, or take other remedies that may be legally available.”  E.g., Ex. 2 at 64-65, \nECF No. 9-2.  Expressly among the types of funds that FEMA may recover are “improper \npayments.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff’s concern, instead, is with the process FEMA used to draw back the $80 million.  \nBut as noted above, FEMA did not “grab back” funds that had been “duly approved and disbursed \nby the grantmaking agency,” PI Mem. at 14, and thus was not required to utilize the cited \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 25 of 35\n“prescribed processes for recovering grant funds,’ id. at 15.  Rather, it was acting to cancel a \npayment made in error, in the same manner someone might cancel a check that had been \ninadvertently mailed to the wrong party.  This action is consistent with FEMA’s general obligation \nto ensure that “Federal funding is expended . . . in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, \napplicable Federal statutes and regulations,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a), as well as applicable Bureau \nof  Fiscal  Service  regulations.    In  particular,  those  regulations  provide  that  all  entities  that \nparticipate  in  the Automated  Clearing  House  (ACH)  network  to  “originate[]  or  receive[]  a \nGovernment entry agrees to be bound” by the regulations, 31 C.F.R. § 210.3(c), and also agrees \n“[t]hat the Federal Government may reverse any duplicate or erroneous entry or file as provided \nin § 210.6(f) of this part.”  Id. § 210.4(b)(5); see also id. § 210.6(f) (permitting an agency to \n“reverse any duplicate or erroneous entry”).  Plaintiff points to no source of law prohibiting such \na limited and common sense action.  Cf. Ledbetter v. Shalala, 986 F.2d 428, 434 (11th Cir. 1993) \n(“This court finds it difficult to conceive that Congress would authorize funds for specific purposes \nbut  would  provide  no  action  to recover the funds if  the funds were  misused  or  otherwise \nimproperly spent.”).  Because FEMA had authority to impose each remedy mentioned in the \nNoncompliance Letter, Plaintiff is not likely to show that the letter is contrary to law. \nProcedure required by law and due process (PI Mem. at 15-16) \nPlaintiff’s procedural APA claim—asserting that FEMA acted “without observance of \nprocedure required by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(D)—and due process claims are based solely on \nFEMA’s alleged “money grab” (i.e., its cancelation of payments mistakenly made).  As noted \nabove, Plaintiff mischaracterizes the nature of FEMA’s action which, properly understood, is fully \nconsistent with applicable procedures.  The funds at issue had not “already been approved and \ndisbursed into a grantee bank account”; rather, they were paid improperly and, once that error was \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 26 of 35\nremedied, were withheld, which Plaintiff concedes is proper.  See PI Mem. at 16.  FEMA’s actions \nto reverse the improper payment are not subject to the regulatory provisions requiring “notice, with \nan opportunity to contest,” id. at 15. \nIn any event, even if those procedural requirements were applicable to the action that \nPlaintiff challenges, FEMA has followed them here.  All that the regulations require is that the \nagency “provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging \nthe  action.”    2  C.F.R.  § 200.342.    FEMA  has  satisfied  that  requirement  by  issuing  the \nNoncompliance Letter, which expressly invites Plaintiff to file an administrative appeal containing \nsuch information.  Plaintiff points to no source of law requiring that an agency seeking to disallow \ncosts and recover funds improperly spent must provide advance notice before doing so.  And \nallowing for this process to occur after the agency’s recovery action is especially appropriate in \nthis context, where the only interest Plaintiff is claiming is money, which as explained further \nabove is “completely compensable by a post-deprivation decision.”  Benson v. Sebelius, 771 F. \nSupp. 2d 68, 77 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quotations omitted). \nPlaintiff asserts a due process claim but does not independently argue for a substantial \nlikelihood of success on that claim, instead contending that FEMA has violated the Due Process \nClause “[f]or the same reasons” Plaintiff contends its conduct violates the APA’s procedural \nrequirements.  PI Mem. at 16.  For the same reasons explained above, then, Plaintiff’s claim fails.  \nAnd to the extent Plaintiff contends (in its complaint) that a “pre-deprivation opportunity to be \nheard”  was  required  here,  Compl.  ¶ 176,  it  is  mistaken.    Even  setting  aside  that  FEMA’s \ncancelation of a mistaken payment does not affect any “deprivation” cognizable under the Due \nProcess Clause, see Ass’n of Proprietary Colleges. v. Duncan, 107 F. Supp. 3d 332, 347 (S.D.N.Y. \n2015) (recognizing that to have a protectable “property interest in a benefit,” a person must “have \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 27 of 35\na legitimate claim of entitlement to it” (quotations omitted)), the Due Process Clause “is flexible \nand calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.”  Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976).  The Clause’s requirements can be satisfied through “adequate \npost-deprivation remedies.”  Rason v. Nicholson, 562 F. Supp. 2d 153, 155 (D.D.C. 2008) \n(quotation omitted); see Catanzaro v. Weiden, 188 F.3d 56, 63 (2d Cir. 1999) (recognizing that \npost-deprivation process can be sufficient where “there is competent evidence allowing the official \nto reasonably believe that an emergency does in fact exist, or that affording predeprivation process \nwould be otherwise impractical”).  Here, given the fact the payment was made improperly in the \nfirst place, it was reasonable for the agency to reclaim the funds first and afterwards provide an \nopportunity for Plaintiff to contest its alleged noncompliance with the grant award.  Cf. López \nBello v. Smith, 651 F. Supp. 3d 20, 40 (D.D.C. 2022) (noting that pre-deprivation process may not \nbe necessary where there is a “need to minimiz[e] the potential for asset flight”). \nArbitrary and capricious and abuse of discretion (PI Mem. at 12-14) \nPlaintiff’s arbitrary-and-capricious arguments are similarly meritless and based on an \nimproper understanding of FEMA’s actions and federal grant law.  Agency action must be upheld \nin the face of an arbitrary and capricious challenge so long as the agency “articulate[s] a \nsatisfactory explanation for [the] action including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.” Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 \nU.S. 657, 682 (2020) (citation omitted).  Under this deferential standard, “a court is not to \nsubstitute its judgment for that of the agency,” and should uphold even a decision of “less than \nideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 513-14 (2009) (citations omitted). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 28 of 35\nHere,  FEMA  provided  a  straightforward  and  persuasive  rationale  for  its  decision  to \nwithhold SSP funding to Plaintiff: concerns that funding was being used to violate the law and \nfund criminal activity.  Given the express provisions in the grant regulations and Plaintiff’s \nparticular instruments authorizing such a remedy for noncompliance with the law, the agency’s \nreasoning was anything but arbitrary.  Plaintiff recognizes that agency action “must be upheld, if \nat all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself,” PI Mem. at 12.  That document, which as noted \nabove  is  a  first-level  agency  determination  to  temporarily  withhold  funding  based  on \nnoncompliance  with  the  law,  not  an  instance  of  federal  rulemaking  with  a  voluminous \nadministrative record, falls within the “zone of reasonableness,” Missouri v. Biden, 595 U.S. 87, \n96 (2022), for a decision of its kind. \nPlaintiff seeks to discredit the evidence FEMA cited of criminal activity at Plaintiff’s SSP \nfacility because the media reports it relied on predated FEMA’s “decision to approve and disburse \nthe City’s SSP funds.”  PI Mem. at 13.  But as discussed above, FEMA made no such decision and \nreleased those funds in error.  In any event, the APA does not require an agency to act immediately \nupon discovering a misuse of funds to take action against the noncompliant party.  FEMA \nresponded  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time  and  consistent  with  the  priorities  of  a  new \npresidential administration, which is not an inappropriate basis upon which to justify agency \naction.  See Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 781 (2019) (“Agency policymaking is \nnot a ‘rarified technocratic process, unaffected by political considerations or the presence of \nPresidential power,” and there would be nothing problematic even if an agency action were \n“informed by unstated considerations” of, among other things, “politics, the legislative process, \npublic relations, [and] interest group relations.”). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 29 of 35\nFinally, Plaintiff’s contention that “no grant conditions or requirements are implicated” by \nFEMA’s concern about federal funds being used to facilitate criminal activity, PI Mem. at 13, \nbeggars belief: as discussed throughout this brief, Plaintiff’s grant requires that it use federal funds \nin compliance with the law. \nD.  Plaintiff’s Constitutional Claims Are Not Likely To Succeed. \nPlaintiff asserts two additional constitutional claims, but they are in reality just variations \nof the argument that Defendants exceeded their statutory authority.  Not “every action by the \nPresident, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is ipso facto in \nviolation of the Constitution,” Dalton v. Spencer, 511 U.S. 462, 472 (1994), and the above analysis \ndefeats Plaintiff’s alleged constitutional claims as well.  In any event, those claims fail on their \nown terms. \nSeparation of Powers \nPlaintiff’s “separation of powers” claim is based entirely on the premise that Defendants \nare  “hostil[e]”  to  the  SSP  program  itself  and  that  the  Noncompliance  Letter  “disregard[s] \nCongressional enactments.”  PI Mem. at 17.  But Plaintiff does not rely on the Noncompliance \nLetter itself for that assertion, which includes findings specific to Plaintiff’s potential misuse of \nfederal funds.   \nMoreover, Plaintiff’s claim assumes that the Noncompliance Letter is “contrary to the \nexpress or implied will of Congress.”  Id. at 16.  As discussed above, that is not the case, and the \nCourt should reject Plaintiff’s attempt to constitutionalize their disagreement about the scope of \nFEMA’s statutory authority.  Simply put, an agency does not violate the separation of powers by \ntemporarily withholding grant funds pursuant to the express terms of federal regulations and the \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 30 of 35\nexpress terms of a grant.  Cf. Northrop Grumman v. United States, 46 Fed. Cl. 622, 626 (2000) \n(“The Government’s right to terminate a contract for convenience is broad.”). \nSpending Clause \nCongress has the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imports, and Excises, to pay the \nDebts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.”   U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The Spending Clause thus allows Congress to, “fix the terms on which it \nshall disburse federal money to the States.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. \n1, 17 (1981); South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).  Conditions on funding must be \n“unambiguous[]”  and  they  cannot  “surprise[]  participating  States  [or  localities]  with  post \nacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 18, 25.  However, advance notice \nof grant conditions may be provided by the federal grant-making agency, rather than Congress, “as \nlong [as] they were grounded in statutory provisions, regulations, and other guidelines provided \nby the Department at the time of the grant.”  New York v. DOJ, 951 F.3d 84, 110 (2d Cir. 2020). \nPlaintiff contends that Defendants have “violated” the Spending Clause by “imposing new, \nretroactive grant conditions.”  PI Mem. at 12.  In particular, it argues that “Defendants cannot \nunilaterally change the terms and requirements of SSP grants in order to grab-back previously \napproved funding disbursed to the City.”  Id. at 17.  Plaintiff does not identify exactly what grant \nconditions are “new” and “retroactive” and therefore purportedly unconstitutional. See id. at 17–\n18.  That is not surprising because the Noncompliance Letter simply identifies conditions and \nremedies, outlined in federal regulations, of which Plaintiff was on notice when it accepted the \nSSP grants.  See Tennessee v. Becerra, 117 F.4th 348, 361 (6th Cir. 2024) (no Spending Clause \nviolation where recipient of funds was on clear notice that it was required to follow applicable \nregulatory requirements and voluntarily agreed to abide by them). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 31 of 35\nTo the extent that Plaintiff challenges the Defendants’ cancellation of the February 4, 2025, \ndisbursement of funds in connection with the FY 2024 SSP, this event was not a grant “condition” \nat all.  It was, instead, a correction of DHS’s erroneous release of the funds in the first place. \nHamilton Decl. ¶¶ 9-11.  \nPlaintiff’s challenge to the prospective remedies outlined in the Noncompliance Letter \nfares no better.  The Noncompliance Letter indicates that, going forward, FEMA will be: (i) \ntemporarily  withholding  payments  for  the  FY  2023  and  2024  awards,  and  (ii)  requesting \ninformation regarding the noncitizen migrants with whom Plaintiff interacted in carrying out the \nscope of its awards.  Noncompliance Letter at 3.  The temporary withholding of payments is a \nremedy for noncompliance expressly authorized by regulation and referenced in Plaintiff’s grant \naward documents—it cannot be a “condition” about which Plaintiff lacked advance notice. 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.339(a).  And requests for information are “specific conditions” permitted by 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.208, which states that “[t]he Federal agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific \nconditions in the Federal award based on an analysis of,” inter alia, “[t]he recipient’s . . . history \nof compliance with the terms and conditions of Federal awards.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.208(b)(2). Specific \nconditions “may include” “additional project monitoring.” Id. § 200.208(c)(4).  Thus, even \nassuming that the requests for information are “conditions” for purposes of the Spending Claims, \nthey are consistent with the Clause’s requirements. \nBecause Defendants have provided Plaintiff advance notice of conditions authorized by \nregulation, Plaintiff cannot show a clear likelihood of success on their Spending Clause claim.  \nNew York, 951 F.3d at 110. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 32 of 35\nIII.  The Equities Weigh Against Emergency Relief. \nFinally, Plaintiff cannot establish that the balance of equities and the public interest favor \ngranting the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction.  These final two factors merge in \ncases where relief is sought from the government.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nIn arguing that the public interest weighs in their favor, Plaintiff primarily relies on the \nnotion that it is likely to prevail on the merits and that there is no public interest in the perpetuation \nof unlawful agency action.  See PI Mem. at 21-22.  But that is just a repackaged version of \nPlaintiff’s merits arguments, which are not likely to succeed, and not an independent basis for \nrelief.  This is especially true given Plaintiff’s nonexistent showing of irreparable harm. \nMeanwhile, contrary to Plaintiff’s assertions that Defendants will suffer no cognizable \nharm if a preliminary injunction is granted, “[a]ny time a [government] is enjoined by a court from \neffectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  \nMaryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers); see also Dist. 4 Lodge \nof the Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers Local Lodge 207 v. Ctr. for Biological \nDiversity, 18 F.4th 38, 47 (1st Cir. 2021) (citing same language from King in a decision granting a \nstay pending appeal of a preliminary injunction against a federal agency rulemaking).  This is \nespecially true here, where FEMA has identified a concern that federal funds will be spent to \nfacilitate criminal activity in violation of requirements applicable to the use of those funds.  And \nwhere the government is legally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement or allocation of \nfederal funds but is nonetheless ordered to release the funding, such funds may not be retrievable \nafterwards. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 33 of 35\nIV.  Relief Against The President Is Improper. \nAlthough Plaintiff has named the President as a Defendant, “courts do not have jurisdiction \nto enjoin [the President] . . . and have never submitted the President to declaratory relief.”  Newdow \nv. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citations omitted); see Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U.S. 788, 802–03 (1992) (“[I]n general ‘this court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the \nPresident in the performance of his official duties.’”) (citation omitted); 505 U.S. at 827 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part) (“[W]e cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President.”); \nMississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475, 501 (1866).  Accordingly, the Court lacks jurisdiction to enter \nPlaintiff’s requested relief against the President and, at minimum, should dismiss him as a \ndefendant in this case.  See Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 609 (2024) (stating that \n“Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his \n‘conclusive and preclusive’ constitutional authority”). \nV.  If the Court Grants Relief, It Should Issue a Preliminary Injunction, Stay the Order, \nand Require Plaintiff to Submit a Bond as Security. \n \nIn the event the Court grants injunctive relief to Plaintiff, that relief should be in the form \nof preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order.  Plaintiff has sought both a \npreliminary injunction and temporary restraining order, but does not explain why it needs a \ntemporary restraining order ahead of a preliminary injunction.  Under these circumstances, the \nmost  appropriate  course  of  action  to  further  party  and  judicial  resources,  and  the  efficient \nresolution of this case, is to decide this matter as a preliminary injunction.  That approach would \nprovide Defendants with an appealable order, see 28 U.S.C. § 129, and avoid redundant litigation \nover both a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 \n(stating  that  rules  should  be  administered  to  “secure  the  just,  speedy,  and  inexpensive \ndetermination of every action and proceeding”). \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 17     Filed 02/28/25     Page 34 of 35\nFurther, if the Court grants the Plaintiff’s requested injunction, the Court should stay the \ninjunction pending any appeal authorized by the Solicitor General.  See Fed. R. App. P. 8(a).  For \nthe reasons explained above, Defendants have, at a minimum, satisfied the requirements for a stay \nof any injunction pending appeal.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.   \nFinally, the Court should order security with any preliminary injunction.  Under Rule 65(c), \nthe Court may issue a preliminary injunction “only if the movant gives security” for “costs and \ndamages sustained by” Defendants if they are later found to “have been wrongfully enjoined[.]”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  As the Second Circuit has explained, the bond requirement “serves a number \nof functions” such as ensuring that the enjoined party “may readily collect damages from the funds \nposted” in the event future proceedings establish that the injunction was entered in error.  Nokia \nCorp. v. InterDigital, Inc., 645 F.3d 553, 557 (2d Cir. 2011).  Should the Court issue an injunction \nrequiring Defendants to pay Plaintiff $80.4 million at this preliminary stage, Defendants request \nPlaintiff post a bond equal to that amount during the pendency of this case, including resolution of \nappeals.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motions for a temporary \nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction. \nDated: February 28, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \nYAAKOV M.

On Tuesday, February ll , 2025, at 4:03 pm, the long arm of the federal\n1 \ngovernment reached into a central bank account of the City of New York (the \"City\") and\ngrabbed $80,481,86L.42.Ittook these funds from the City without any advance notice that it\nwould be doing so and without communicating any decision or rationale to the City.\n2.  Defendant U.S. Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (\"FEMA\") took back\nthe funds it paid the City on February 4,2025, even though it had thoroughly reviewed and\nanalyzedthe extensive supporting documentation submitted by the City and approved payment\nas reimbursement for eligible and compliant expenditures under two federal grants awarded\nunder the Shelter and Services Programs (\"SSP\").\n3.  Indeed, FEMA offered and awarded the grants and reviewed and approved the\npayment to the City, to offset allowable costs the City incurred for shelter and services it\nprovided to noncitizen migrants who were processed and released into the community by\ndefendant the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). FEMA's stated purpose in\noffering the grants-to \"relievfe] overcrowding in short-term holding facilities of U.S. Customs\nand Border Protection\"-is  the exact purpose for which the City used the funds.\n4.  These funds were appropriated by Congress for the purpose of making SSP grants\navailable nationwide to local governments and non-profit organizations in border states, such as\nTexas and Arizona, andother locales, like New York City, receiving the largest influxes of\nmigrants released by DHS.\nI\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 3 of 50\n5.  Before FEMA transferred these funds to the City on February 4, FEMAhad\nalready reviewed the City's grant applications and awarded the grants, reviewed and approved\nthe City's budget for each glant, and reviewed and approved the City's reimbursement request,\nwhich included extensive detail as to each migrant who received services and back-up\ndocumentation validating the costs incurred.\n6.  Despite the fact that FEMAhad reviewed and approved the City's request, and\nissued payment, Defendants grabbed the money back without any administrative  process\nwhatsoever. Indeed, as of the moming of February 18,2025, FEMAs platform for grant making\nand administration, entitled \"FEMA GO\" (an acronym for \"FEMA Grant Operations\"),\ncontinued to indicate that the City's approved request for $80,481 ,861.42 was disbursed to the\nCity.\n7.  Defendants have made it clear in contemporaneous public statements that they\nopposed the very purpose for which SSP funds were appropriated by Congress and approved by\nFEMA and that they intended to make sure the funds were recouped and never paid.\n8.  For example, defendant Cameron Hamilton, Senior Official Performing the Duties\nof the FEMAAdministrator posted on February 10,2025,the day before the money grab:\n\"@USCongress  should have never passed bills in 2023 and2024 asking FEMAto do this work. .\n. . Thi s stops now. \" https : l l x. coml F EMA-Cam/ stattts 1 1 888923 67 2 523 489 649 .\ng. \nLikewise, defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in announcing the previous\nday's money {ab,posted on February 12,2025: \"I have clawed back the full payment that\nFEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to NYC migrant hotels.\"\nstiN 4575\n2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 4 of 50\n10.  The statements could not be clearer: Defendants'purpose for grabbing back the\nfunds was not related to the City's specific expenditures at all, but to thwart the very purpose of\nthe SSP.\n11.  No lawful procedure permits Defendants-as they did here-to take back grant\nfunds previously approved and paid without legitimate basis and without first following and\ncomplying with the steps required under the applicable rules, grant terms and conditions.\nDefendants have acted lawlessly, but have attempted, after the fact, to mask this fact with a\nsemblance of following procedure.\n12.  First, several hours after grabbing the funds back from the City, Defendants,\nincluding DHS and FEMA, filed papers in a federal court proceeding in Rhode Island requesting\nthat court's confirmation that Defendants may permissibly \"withhold\" FEMA funding, and\nrepresented to that court that they intended to provide \"notice to New York City regarding the\nfunding pause and will provide the information and process required by regulation and the terms\nand conditions of the award.\" Defs.' Emergency Motion, New Yorkv. Trump,No. 1:25-cv-00039\n(D.R.I. Feb. 11,2025),ECF No. 102. FEMAdid not tell the Court that, far from merely\n,'withholding\" funds, it had already, just hours earlier, taken back from the City funds that it had\npreviously approved and Paid.\n13.  Further, having stated publicly that it was opposed to spending the funds\naltogether, and having taken the funds without following any lawful process whatsoever, FEMA\nnonetheless represented to the Court that it sought to \"withhold\" funding solely ooon the basis of\nthe applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.\" Id.Yetatthatpoint, FEMAhad not\ncomplied with any applicable statutes, regulations, and glant terms and conditions and had taken\nback funds in violation of the same.\nJ\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 5 of 50\n14.  Next, a week later, in a post hoc effort to adorn defendants' lawless money grab\nwith a veneer of administrative  process, Administrator Hamilton sent the City's Office of\nManagement and Budget (\"City OMB\"), which administers the FEMA grants for the City, a\n\"Remedy forNoncompliance  Letter\" dated February 18,2025 (\"noncompliance\" letter) that\npurports to set forth \"Findings\" of significant concern that the SSP funds are going towards\n\"illegal activities.\" FEMA sent this letter just days after the City publicly announced its intention\nto sue over the money grab.\n15.  Simply put, the \"noncompliance\" letter is pretextual, a cover for Defendant's real\nintent, which-as they've stated publicly-is to withhold the funds permanently because they\noppose the purposes for which the funds were appropriated, awarded, approved, and paid. The\nof\nletter, relying only on unsubstantiated characterizations of \"media reports,\" makes allegations \ncrime and gang activity at the Roosevelt Hotel---one of the many locations for which FEMA\nreimbursed the city for shelter and services. Tellingly, the letter omits any mention that FEMA\nofficials twice visited the Roosevelt Hotel in Septemb er 2024 and that those visits did not lead to\nany findings of alleged criminal activity. In addition, Defendants fail to cite any regulatory\nauthority that supports denying funding to the City under the SSP based on purported criminal\nactivity by those released by DHS into the community when the City has been assisting DHS in\nproviding shelter.\n16.  Further, the letter makes a show of requesting information to further a purported\nreview of the City's SSP awardsfor2024  and2023 (\"SSP24\" and \"SSP23\",and collectively\n,'SSP awards\"), but mainly seeks information that OMB previously provided to FEMA, and that\nFEMA already reviewed and approved in order to determine that the claimed reimbursements\nwere allowable. Indeed, while the letter alleges the City is somehow encouraging illegal\n4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 6 of 50\nimmigration, FEMA already confirmed in approving and issuing the payment that all funds were\nused to provide services to individuals who DHS had released from its custody into the\ncommunity.\n17.  The letter does not identiff any applicable rules or grant terms or conditions with\nwhich it alleges the City might not have complied. Instead, the letter effectively - and improperly\n- adds new terms and conditions. The letter is meant to look like it affords the requisite\nadministrative process when, in fact, the decision has already been made to deny payment to the\nCity because Defendants do not want to pay the City for providing the very services to the very\npeople for the very pu{poses that Congress appropriated the funds and FEMA awarded the grants\nand approved and made the payments.\n18.  This lawsuit challenges two actions by Defendants based on two core contentions.\nFirst, Defendants'money-grab-after  FEMAreview, approval, and actual payment, without\nnotice or process of any kind-was, simply put,lawless. It violated federal regulations and grant\nterms, was contrary to law and in excess of authority, and contrary to their obligations to\nimplement Congressional appropriations.\nlg.  Second, Defendants February 18,2025 withholding letter likewise violates the\nlaw. Indeed, despite Defendants'representations  to the federal court in Rhode Island that they\nwere withholding FEMA funding from the City in accordance with applicable rules, grant terms\nand conditions, and not pursuant to a \"fundingfreeze\" or'opause\" of the type that is temporarily\nrestrained in that case, they are using the post hoc pretense of regular administrative  procedure to\nmask that they are in fact acting pursuant to a broad \"freeze\" or \"pause\" on SSP funding. This\nappears to be part of an overarching strategy of finding ways to get around the TRO in New York\n5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 7 of 50\nv. Trump and refuse to spend funds specifically authorized by Congress for this express purpose\neven after those funds were previously approved and actually paid by the very same agency.\n20.  Because Defendants took the extraordinary and lawless measure of seizing money\nfrom the City's bank account-by surprise, and without notice-the City seeks the extraordinary\nremedy of mandatory injunctive relief to compel Defendants to return the money to the City'\nrestoring the status quo ante. Such remedy is necessary because funds paid through\nCongressional appropriation  are not fungible-if not disbursed, they can be reappropriated, or\nthe appropriation  may expire before this case is resolved, leaving the City without recourse.\nDefendants, notwithstandingthe post hoc pretense of administrative  process, have made it\nabundantly clear that they intend to withhold permanently every dime FEMApreviously\nawarded, approved for reimbursement, and paid to the City.\n21.  Defendants also seek relief to make sure that Defendants do not improperly grab\nmore money from the City and do not improperly withhold funds that the City is entitled to\nrecelve.\n22.  Therefore, the City brings this suit for a declaration that the money grab and the\nwithholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds are each arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, ultra\nvires and in excess of authority, without observance of lawful procedures, and each violates the\nDue Process Clause, the separation of powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. The City also\nseeks relief (1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMAmoney grab by returning the $80\nmillion to the City's bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from\nany City bank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining\nthem from implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds.\n6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 8 of 50\nPARTIES\n23.

Congress Appropriated Funds for Local Governments to Assist in Providing Shelter\nand Services to Migrants Released by DHS into the Community\n36.  In2019, as part of the federal government's response \"to the significant rise in\naliens at the southwest border,\" Congress authorized FEMA to provide grants to local\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations  assisting migrants encountered by DHS at the southern\nborder and released into the community. These grants were only available to'Jurisdictions or\nlocal recipi ent organizations serving communities  that have experienced a significant influx\" of\nmigrants and covered the provision of food, shelter, basic medical care, and transportation. These\ngrants were provided through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Progtam Humanitarian\n(\"EFSP-H\"). See Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian  Assistance and\nSecurity at the Southern BorderAct, Pub. L. No. 116-26,Title III, 133 Stat. 1020-21(2019). This\nprogram continued into the BidenAdministration. See Department of Homeland Security\nAppropriationsAct, 2023,Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 Stat.4740 (2022).\n37.  Ln2023, Congress authorized FEMA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n(\"CBP\") to establish SSP. See Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2023,Pub'\nL. No. 117-328,Title II, 136 Stat. 4730 (2022).The stated purpose of SSP is to relieve\novercrowding in short-term CBP holding facilities. To that end, the program reimburses non-\nfederal entities providing shelter and related services to noncitizen migrants following their\nrelease from DHS.\n9\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 11 of 50\n38.  ln2)24,Congress, through the Department of Homeland SecurityAppropriations\nAct,2024,Pub.  L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 598 (the \"DHS AppropriationsAct\"), authorized\ncontinued funding for SSP. Title II of thatAct, entitled Security, Enforcement, and Investigations,\nprovides that $650 million \"shall be transferred to 'Federal Emergency ManagementAgency-\nFederal Assistance'to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities,\nin support of relieving overcrowding in short term holding facilities of the U.S. Customs and\nBorder Protection.\"l\nB. The SSP24 Grants\n39.  On April 12,2024, FEMA issued two Notices of Funding Opportunity ('NOFO\")\nfor the Fiscal Year 2024 Shelter and Services Program. One NOFO announced an allocation\ngrant,meaning that the amount the City and other localities could apply for were pre-determined\non an allocation basis (\"SSP-A Granf'). The other NOFO announced a competitive grant-that\nis, the City's application would compete with others for an award from a limited set of funds\nI See also FEMA, Shelter and Services Program, https://www.fema.gov/erants/shelter-services-\nprogram (last visited Feb. 13, 2025) (\"SSP provides financial support to non-federal entities to\nprovide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS).

Both SSP grants have an expected period of performance of 36 months, from\nOctober 1,2023 to September 30, 2026.\n41. \nThe NOFOs described the SSP as follows:\nAs directed by Congress, SSP makes federal funds available to enable non-\nfederal entities to off-set allowable costs incurred for services associated with\nnoncitizen migrants recently encountered  and released by DHS.

The NOFOs described the goals of SSP as \"the safe, orderly, and humane release\nof noncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.\" The objectives of the program\ninclude providing funding for non-federal entities that serve \"noncitizen migrants recently\nreleased from DHS custody\" to \"temporarily provide shelter, food, transportation, acute medical\ncare, [and] personal hygiene supplies.\"\n43.  The NOFOs speciSz the allowable (i.e., reimbursable) activities under the SSR\nincluding providing shelter at hotels and motels and providing food, medical supplies, clothes\nand personal hygiene products. SSP-ANOFO at 69 et seq.; SSP-C NOFO at64 et seq.\n44.  As noted above, the FY 2024 SSP appropriation provided $650 million for SSP,\nincluding FEMA administration costs. The SSP-A funds were allocated to grantees in two\nrounds, with allocations based on release and destination data received from CBP. The NOFO\nreleased on April 12,2024 announced $300 million in round 1 allocations and the amended\nNOFO released on August 28,2024 announced round 2 (Reserve Fund) allocations. New York\nCity was allocated $38.86 million for round I and $20.4 million for round 2.\n45.  Millions of dollars were also allocated for non-profit organizations and local\ngovemments across the country including more than $60 million for specified cities, counties,\nand not-for-profits in Texas, $10.8 million for Fulton County, Georgia, $11.6 million to Maricopa\nCounty, Adzona, and $21.8 million to Pima County, Arizona.\n46.  The remaining $340.9 million was released through SSP-C grants. See SSP-A\nNOFO at 5; SSP-C NOFO at 7.

To accept the SSP-A and SSP-C grants funds, the City was required to agree to\nthe terms set forth in the NOFOs and Award Letters. See SSP-AAward Letter at 1, SSP-C Award\nLetter at 1.\n58.

Following a review process, FEMA approved the City's SSP24 grant budgets on\nJanuary 8 and 10,2025, respectively.\n63.  On January 14,2025, City OMB submitted to FEMA a request for reimbursement\nof $22,169,838.00 of expenditures for its Fiscal Year 2024 SSP-C grant and on January 15,2025,\nCity OMB submitted to FEMA a request for reimbursement of costs in the amount of\n85g,302,125.07 for its Fiscal Year 2024 SSP-A grant, together representing the entirety of the\nSSP grant awards to the City for Fiscal Yeat 2024.\n64. \nIn support of the payment requests, City OMB submitted all of the\ndocumentation required by FEMA including the name and A-Number for each individual, and\ninvoices and other documentation  of expenditures'\n65.  On January 3I,2025, following its review of the City's submissions, FEMA\ninformed the City that the reimbursement for the SSP grants would need to be reduced slightly to\naccount for an error rate of roughly 1.22% in matching theA-Numbers to eligibility for\nreimbursement and indicated that it would approve and make payment upon a request for the\nreduced amount.\nt6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 18 of 50\n66.  The City resubmitted to FEMArevised payment requests for the two gtants in the\namounts of $58,581 ,446.08 and $21,900,415.34,respectively, as pre-authorized by FEMA. The\namounts in the revised payment requests reflected a reduction of l.22oh from the City's initial\npayment requests to account for FEMA s 1.22o/o error rate finding. The remaining balance-\nroughly $l million between the two grants-remains available for future reimbursement of\nallowable expenses based on a subsequent submission.\n67.  On February 4,2025,the City received payments by ACH wire transfer to the\nCity's central treasury account of $58,581,446.08 and $21,900,415.34, the full amount that\nFEMAhad approved for reimbursement to the City.\n68.  FEMA's approval and payment of these amounts constitutes FEMAs\ndetermination-after  thoroughly reviewing budget details, expenditure documentation, and\npersonal information of migrants-that the funds FEMA approved and disbursed were allowable\nunder the grant terms and conditions.\nC.

FEMA did not provide any advance notice to the City of the money grab. FEMA\ndid not follow any of the measures set forth in the grant terms and conditions or the regulations\nrelevant to the grant. In fact, FEMA does not appear to have followed any administrative process\nat all in grabbing the SSP funds.\nI7\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 19 of 50\n71.

Federal Officials Make Pubtic Statements Opposing SSP\n72.  While FEMA did not communicate directly with City OMB before or\nimmediately after its money grab either to warn that it intended to take the money or to provide\nany reasons why, outside the grant administration  process, various federal officials-including\nElon Musk, an unelected and unconfirmed individual who appears to be leading the Department\nof Govemment Efficiency (\"DOGE\"), defendant Kristi Noem, the Secretary of the Department of\nHomeland Security, and defendant FEMAActing Administrator Cameron Hamilton-made\npublic statements condemning SSP and touting the FEMAmoney grab on social media, in press\nreleases, and in court proceedings to which the City is not aparty. These statements make\nunsupported claims regarding the FEMA funding received by the City and do not identify any\nlawful ground for FEMA to ignore Congress's intent and the applicable rules and grant terms and\nconditions and grab back the money it awarded, approved, and paid to the City.\n73.  On Monday, February 10,2025 at 5:03 am, Elon Musk, in a post filled with\ninaccuracies, posted that DOGE had \"discovered\" a $59 million payment from FEMA to the City'\n\"to house illegal immigrants,\" that a \"demand\" would be made for the return of the funds, that\nthe funds were meant for disaster relief and that \"sending this money violated the law\":\nt8\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 20 of 50\nI\nElon Muskg  Subscribe )d\n* @elolrmusk\nThe @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to\nluxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.\nSending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the\nPresident's executive order.\nThat money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent\non high end hotels for illegals!\nA clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds.\n5:03 AM ' Feb 10,2025' 66.2M Views\nc\ntI  (2 \nQ aor tzgr o+zr R 28K\nhttps ://x. com/elonmusk/status/ 1 8 8 8 8 9 I 5 I 23 03 263 8 I 5.\n74.  Far from being diverted from an approved purpose of \"disaster relief\" the funds\nwere approved and disbursed pursuant to SSR exactly as authorized and intended by Congress\nand awarded, approved, and paid by FEMA.\n75.  Contrary to Musk's post, the funds were not used to pay for'oluxury hotels,\" but\nrather to pay the FEMA-approved rate of $62.19 per person for lodging in any of the more than\n220 hotels, motels, or other facilities that FEMAreviewed and approved. Further, FEMApaid\nonly for shelter and service to migrants who FEMA confirmed before making payment had a\nDHS-issuedA-Number  and who DHS released from its custody into the community.\n76.

The statement could not be clearer: Defendants'purpose for grabbing back the\nfunds was to stop the SSP program entirely. It was not related to the City-specific costs or\ncompliance issues, but was designed to thwart the very pufpose for which Congress appropriated\nthe funds and FEMA awarded, approved, and disbursed them.\n79.  On Tuesday February 11,2025, DHS announced that it had fired four FEMA\nemployees, including the chief financial officer, \"for circumventing leadership to unilaterally\nmake egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants.\"\n2I\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 23 of 50\n1l\nemployees-who-made-payments-luxury;  see also Luis Ferr6-Sadumf, Top FEMA Official Is\nFired Over Paymentsfor N.Y.C.

To evade these obligations and create cover for the money grab, at approximately\n7 p.m. on February l1,2025-three hours after FEMAhad already grabbed $80M from the\nCity's bank account without notice-some of the defendants here filed a motion in New York v.\nTrump entitled, ooEmergency Motion. . . for Permission to Continue Withholding FEMA and\nOther Funding.\"\n85.  The emergency motion purported to seek confirmation that a \"withholding\" of\nFEMA funding to the City did not violate the TRO.\n86.  Without mentioning that FEMAhad already taken from the City funds that FEMA\nhad approved and transferred to the City a fulI week earlier, the emergency motion stated that\n,'FEMA seeks to withhotd Shelter and Services Program (SSP) funding based on concerns\nregarding the program\" and \"respectfully requests confirmation that Defendants may permissibly\n23\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 25 of 50\nwithhold certain FEMA funding, i.e., as 'a specific instance where they are acting in compliance\nwith this Order but otherwise withholding funds due to specific authority.\"' Id.

In a declaration accompanying the emergency motion, FEMAActing\nAdministrator Hamilton represented that FEMA had \"paused\" SSP funding because of concerns\nthe funds were being mis-used by the City and that FEMAwould follow all applicable processes\nunder the SSP grant and applicable laws and regulations. Specifically, Administrator Hamilton\nmade the following representations:\no \n\"As of today, the Department has paused funding to the Shelter and Services\nProgram based on significant concerns that the funding is going to entities\nengaged in or facilitating illegal activities.\"\no \n\"For example, a substantial portion of Shelter and Services Program money\ngoes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.\nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has\ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of\noperations to plan a variety of crimes.\"\no  ooFEMAis in the process of requesting information from New York City to\nfurther investigate this matter to ensure that federal funds are not being used\nfor illegal activities.\"\no \n\"FEMA will begin the process of providing notice to New York City regarding\nthe funding pause and will provide the information and process required by\nregulation and the terms and conditions of the award.

The Noem Memo explained that, in Noemns view, the \"[DHS] has spent\n24\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 26 of 50\nbillions of dollars funding illegal immigration,\" including by funding NGOs that \"purport[] to\nprovide a variety of services to illegal aliens.\" In pausing the NGO funding for SSR Secretary\nNoem makes clear her opposition to the program itself.\n89.  The Hamilton Declaration relied on \"media reports,\" rather than on any fact-based\nanalysis. It did not identifu any activity by the City that was inconsistent with SSP24 grant\nconditions or unlawful, except for vague allegations of encouraging aliens to reside in the U.S.,\ntransporting illegal aliens, harboring, or aiding and abetting. Since all of the migrants for whom\nFEMAreimbursed  the City were released into the community by DHS with anANumber, and\nthe reimbursement was for the express purpose of relieving DHS of the burden of maintaining\nthese individuals in DHS custody, these assertions are misleading and without merit.\n90.  The Hamilton Declaration did not inform the court that FEMAhad already, three\nhours before the emergency motion was filed, grabbed back $80 million in SSP funds from the\nCity without complying with any of the notice or procedural requirements in the SSPAward\nLetters, NOFOs or the applicable federal regulations.\ngl. \nThe Hamilton Declaration cites 2 C.F.R. S 200.242,but that provision does not\nexist. 2 C.F.R. 5 200.342,however,  requires that an agency that \"initiatfes] a remedy for\nnoncompliance  (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective action plan, or termination)'.. must\nprovide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the\naction.\" No such opportunity was provided before FEMAtook the money.\n92.  The Court denied the emergency motion on February 12,2025, stating:\nAs to FEMA funds to New York City, the Defendants represent that they\nintend to provide 'notice to New York City regarding the funding pause and\nwill provide the information and process required by regulation and the terms\nand conditions of the award.'ECF No. 102-l atfl 13. Because the Defendants\nare seeking to terminatefunding 'on the basis of the applicable authorizing\n25\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 27 of 50\nstotutes, regulations, and terms,'ECF No. 50 at 12 (emphasis added), the\nCourt sees no need for further clarification.\nOrdet New Yorkv.

The District Court of Rhode Island thus relied on Defendants'representation  that\nthey were seeking to \"pause\" funding \"on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes,\nregulations and terms\" when, in fact, far from merely pausing funding, Defendants had already\ngrabbed back funds that had been paid to the City, and had done so without providing notice to\nthe City and without following any of the applicable statutes, regulations and terms.\n94.  The day after the filing in the Rhode Island case, on February 12,2025, at l:37\npm, defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem repeated the unsupported statements in the Hamilton\nDeclaration, that persons residing in hotels the City used to temporarily shelter non-citizen\nmigrants committed crimes and that approved SSP funds were grabbed back for that reason.\nhttps://x.com/ItuistiNoem/status/1  88974575292407408  8.\ntt\n0 (l\nKristi Noem \n@KristiNoem\nI have clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activists\nunilaterally gave to NYC migrant hotels.\nFEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua\nbase of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer.\nMark my words: there will not be a single penny spent that goes against\nthe interest and safety of the American people.\nc\nQ s.sr tJ zrr Q rror f,l r:r\n26\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 28 of 50\nF.

More than a week after the money gtab, Defendants began to manufacture a\nveneer of the procedural compliance that Administrator Hamilton had represented in court filings\nthey were following. On February 19,2025,Neil Thompson, the Deputy Assistant Director at\nCity OMB, received a letter, dated February 18,2025, from FEMAActing Administrator\nHamilton with the subject line 'oRemedy for Noncompliance Letter, Shelter and Services\nProgtam (SSP).\"\n96.  In the letter, Administrator Hamilton purports to \"notifu fCity OMB] that\nDHS/FEMAis  temporarily withholding payments to fCity OMB]\" for three grant awards: the\nFY24 SSP-Agrant award of $59,302,125.07,theFY24  SSP-C gtant award of $22,169,838.00,\nand an SSP grant award the City received for FY23 in the amount of $106,879,743.00 (\"SSP23\nGranf'). The letter admits that FEMAhad already grabbed back the SSP-A and SSP-C grant\nawards paid to the City, stating that FEMA \"recovered two payments completed via direct\ndeposit on February 4,2025,totaling $80,481,861.42.\" The letter claims that the money grab\n\"constitutes a part of this temporary withholding.\"\n97.  The letter states that DHS/FEMA is withholding funds pursuant to 2 C.F.R.\n$ 200.339(a), which states that \"[w]hen [a] Federal agency . . . determines that noncompliance\ncannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency . . . may . . . (a)\ntemporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes corrective action.\" But\nthe letter also states, inconsistently with the above, that FEMA \"is instituting specific conditions\non fthe City's] award pursuant to 2 C.F.R. $ 200.208.\" As noted above, 2 C.F.R. $ 200.208\nallows federal agencies to adjust specific conditions in the Federal award based on analysis of the\nfollowing factors:\n27\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 29 of 50\n(1) Review of OMB-designated  repositories of govemment-wide data (for\nexample, SAM.gov) or review of its risk assessment (See $ 200.206);\n(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and\nconditions of Federal awards;\n(3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance\ngoals as described in $ 200.211; or\n(4) A determination  of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate\nfinancial capability to perform the Federal award.\n98.  The letter fails to note, however, that FEMAmay not initiate a remedy for\n'ononcompliafice,\" such as withholding funds, without providing notice to the City and an\nopportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. 2 C.F.R. S 200'342.\nIgnoring that rule, FEMA not only instituted a withholding, it took back funds it had already\nawarded, approved, and paid before commencing any administrative process whatsoever.\ngg. \nThe letter also omits reference to regulations providing that \"payments for\nallowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance  unless\nrequired by Federal statute, regulations,\" or \"The recipient ... has failed to comply with the terms\nand conditions of the Federal award; or... is delinquent in a debt.\" CFR $ 200.305(b)(6)\n(emphasis added). If \"such conditions\" aro met, \"the Federal agency... may, after providing\nreasonable notice,withhold payments to the recipient... until the conditions are conected.\" Id.\nAnd in the event payments are withheld for noncompliance, they must be released'tpon\nsubsequent compliance.\" 2 CFR $ 200.305(bX7).\n100. Here, FEMA has not identified any federal statute or regulation that requires\nwithholding of SSP grant funds, nor has it identified any grant terms or conditions with which\nDefendants allege the City has not complied. Whatever the supposed violation, Defendants have\nnot made a final determination  following notice and opportunity to be heard.\n28\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 30 of 50\n101. Instead, even taking the letter at face value, the stated reasons for withholding\nfunds are based on specious and unsubstantiated allegations unrelated to any grant terms or\nconditions.\n102. The \"noncompliance\" letter announces purported \"Findings,\" which are expressed\naS no more than \"concems\" and which are, in any event, facially pretextual.\n103. First, the letter states that DHS \"has significant concerns that SSP funding is\ngoing to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities.\" But it does not allege any purported\nillegal activities committed by any entity that might have been paid with funds for which the City\nobtained reimbursement. Instead, the letter alleges-citing and exaggerating the same news\nreports that defendant Hamilton cited in his declaration a week earlier:\nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has\ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of\noperations to plan a variety of crimes. According to these same reports, these\ncrimes include gun and drug sales as well as sex trafficking, which can\nreasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself.\nlO4. The letter asserts that \"DHS/FEMA has a responsibility to ensure that it does not\nmake payments that fund criminal activity\" but, as FEMAknows, the grant does provide\noofinancial support to non-federal entities to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen\nmigrants following their release from the Department of Homeland Security.\" FEMA, Shelter\nand Services Program, https://wwwfema.gov/erants/shelter-services-program (last visited Feb.\nt3,2025).\n105. A further \"finding\" is FEMA's purported \"concern\" that\nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging\nor inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in\nviolation of law, 8 u.s.c. $ 132a(a)(l)(A)(iv); transporting or moving illegal\naliens, id. $ 1324(a)(t)(A)(ii);  harboring, concealing, or shielding from\n29\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 31 of 50\ndetection illegal aliens, id. $ 1324(axlXA)(iii); or applicable conspiracy,\naiding or abetting, or attempt liability respecting these statutes.\n106. As FEMAknows, this is a patently false \"concern\" because the grants fund only\nthose costs for shelter and services that are provided to individuals that DHS determined to\nrelease from its custody into the community. That is, the individual was already in the United\nStates, in DHS custody, and then released by DHS to the community-facts that FEMA\nconfirmed for each individual before, and as a condition of, making payment.\n107. The \"noncompliance\" letter claims that \"[b]ased bn the concerns described . . . ,\nDHS/FEMAwill  conduct additional monitoring and review of'the FY23 andFY24 SSP awards\n'oas permitted by the terms and conditions of the award(s) to ensure compliance with all terms\nand conditions of [the] award(s).\" The letter reiterates that \"[d]uring this time, payments under\nthe grant award(s) will be temporarily held. This action includes the amount of funding . . . that\nDHS/FEMA recently clawed back.\" The 'ononcompliance\" letter adds that \"[u]pon the conclusion\nof that monitoring, FEMAwill notifu you of the results and any other remedies for\nnoncompliance  or specific conditions, as appropriate.\"\n108. The o'noncompliance\" letter makes a show of requesting information that would\nsomehow assist FEMAin making a final determination. But the information requested is largely\ninformation that FEMA not only has, but has already reviewed in determining to make payment\nto the City. The letter seeks:\nAll documents regarding the aliens with whom your organization  and your\nsubrecipients and contracts interacted with in carrying out the scope of your\nSSP award, including their names and contact information; and a detailed and\ndescriptive list of specific services provided, and proof of provision of these\nservices; or\nA written statement that your organization has already submitted all of the\ninformation identified in No. 1, above, to DHS/FEMA.\n30\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 32 of 50\n109. As noted above, the City supplied the name and A-Number for individuals for\nwhom the City sought reimbursement, as well as proof of services rendered-all of which FEMA\nreviewed and approved for payment. Further, none of the information requested is in any way\nrelated to the letter's stated central o'concern\": allegations of criminal activity. It is a charade of a\nrequest for information, not a meaningful request'\nG. The,oNoncompliance\"  Letter Wrongly Implicates the Fiscal Year 2023 SSPAward\n110. The'Noncompliance  Letter\" references the SSP23 grant, though it is unclear\nwhether and to what extent FEMA s \"findings\" concem that grant. Indeed, FEMA already\nconducted a \"Compliance Review\" with respect to the SSP23 Grant and made findings, afact\nomitted from the \"Noncompliance Letter.\" Despite having conducted a financial and\nprogrammatic site visit-including at the Roosevelt Hotel-FEMA did not identifu in its\nCompliance Review Findings any of the matters now set forth in the \"noncompliance\" letter.\n1l l.  As background: FEMA awarded the City $106.9 million under the SSP23 grant\nand, to date, has reimbursed the City $70.6 million for allowable costs under the grant.\nIl2.  As with the SSP24 Grants, FEMAs stated purpose in offering the SSP23 Grant\nwas:\nTo provide funding to non-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants\nrecently released from DHS custody to temporarily provide shelter, food,\ntransportation, acute medical care, personal hygiene supplies, and labor\nnecessary to manage cases to provide these services; and,\nTo provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to\ntemporarily shelter noncitizen migrants recently released from DHS custody,\nincluding renovations and modifications to existing facilities.\nThe SSp23 NOFO further states FEMA s \"priority\" of the \"safe, orderly, and humane release of\nnoncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.\"\n3l\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 33 of 50\nI 13. The City applied for the SSP23 Grant on July 12,2023. FEMA initially awarded\nthe City a granlof $104.7 million by notice effectiveAugust 11,2023, which it increased to\n$106.9 million on September 28,2023.As with the applications for the SSP24 Grants, the City's\napplication for the SSP23 Grant included a list of all the locations for which the City indicated it\nmight seek reimbursement, including the Roosevelt Hotel.\nIl4.  OMB submitted two requests for partial reimbursement under the SSP23 Grant.\nFEMA approved the City's first reimbursement request in the amount of $25.5 million on July\n25,2024. FEMA approved the City's second reimbursement request in the amount of $45.1\nmillion on January 7,2025. To date, the City has received $70.6 million in reimbursement from\nFEMAunder the SSP23 Grant. Under the grant terms, $36.3 million remains available for\nclaiming reimbursement of allowable costs.\n115. As with the FY24 SSP-A and SSP-C Grants, OMB submitted to FEMAthe name,\nA-Number, and other information for each individual for whom the City's cost of providing\nshelter and services was included in the reimbursement request. In addition, for the SSP23 Grant,\nOMB was required to include the DHS Release Date (the date DHS released each individual\nfrom DHS custody) because, per the gtant terms, FEMA would only reimburse for shelter and\nservices provided within 45 days of release. FEMAreviewed all of this information in\ndetermining that the City's reimbursement request was for allowable costs and in determining to\nmake the payment.\n116. In stark contrast with thepo st hoc pretextual process around FEMA s money grab,\nFEMAhad previously initiated a compliance review audit of the first payment made under the\nSSP23 Grant that included a'Joint financial and progtamming site visit.\" As part of the visit,\nofficials from FEMA and the Customs and Border Protection toured the Roosevelt Hotel and\n32\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 34 of 50\nanother facility on Septemb er 9,2024.Apart from the Compliance Review, FEMA officials\nvisited the Roosevelt Hotel on September 26,2024.\nlI7.  On November 29,2024, FEMAprovided its findings to OMB by letter. FEMA\nmade findings in three areas: (1) data privacy protections forANumbers, (2) contract provisions,\nand (3) certain financial management issues. Having visited the Roosevelt Hotel twice, FEMA\ndid not identifu any purported gang or illegal activities at the Roosevelt Hotel in its Compliance\nReview Findings.\n18. FEMA has conducted zero additional visits to the Roosevelt Hotel. The recent\n1 \n\"noncompl ianse\" letter provides no first-hand account in support of FEMA s allegations of\ncriminal activity and instead relies solely on characterizations of unsubstantiated media reports.\nThat is not a proper process and is indicative that Defendants have determined not to fund the\nCity's SSP grants under any circumstances and are seeking to create a paper trail to mask the fact\nthat the determination  is not related to \"noncompliance\" or to any proper grounds for\nwithholding funds.\nH. FEMA is Bound by Extensive Rules and Procedures, Including in the Grant Terms\nand Conditions\n119. By grabbing back funding from the City, and suspending further funding under\nSSP24 and SSP23, FEMAhas acted contrary to the applicable rules and grant terms. There is\nnothing in the NOFOs, Award Letters, nor the applicable regulations, that allows Defendants to\n'orecover\" funds by taking them out of the City's bank account before going through an\nadministrative process that includes notice and an opportunity to object.\n120. Furthermore, Defendants'supposed  administrative determination  to suspend\nSSP24 and SSP23 funding is plainly pretextual, as it does not identifr any legitimate basis for\nwithholding SSP funding - let alone for having taken back funds that were previously approved\nJJ\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 35 of 50\nand paid. Instead, it makes specious allegations unrelated to the grant terms, asks for submission\nof information that City OMB already provided and that FEMA already reviewed in detail, and\nfails to cite any grant term with which the City has not complied.\nI.  The Money Grab Violates Federal Rules and Grant Terms and Conditions\nI2I.  As described above, FEMA did not provide any notice to City OMB before the\nmoney grab.\n122. The money grab was made in total disregard of the fact that FEMA awarded the\ngrant and then reviewed, approved, and paid the reimbursement.\n123. No lawful grounds exist-and none have been asserted-for the money gtab, and\nno lawful procedure was followed. Instead, defendants have made clear that their true intent is to\nhalt the program entirely because they do not like it, and have commenced a post hoc\n\"procedure\" to give legal gloss to their unlawful determination  and action. The money grab must\nbe reversed and defendants prevented from engaging in unlawful money grabs in the future.\nJ. The City Faces lrreparable Harm\nI24.  The over $80 million grabbed back by Defendants is reimbursement for amounts\nthat the City already expended in reliance on the SSP's terms, and that FEMA awarded, reviewed\nin detail, approved for payment, and paid to the City.\n125. Because of Defendants'money grab, the City is at risk of losing this funding\npermanently even if it prevails in this lawsuit. SSP funds could become unavailable to the City\nduring the time it takes to decide this lawsuit, if the SSP appropriation  is fully obligated (i.e. the\nCity's funds are redistributed to other recipients) and thus exhausted; the appropriation expires;\nor if the appropriation is rescinded by Congress. Defendants have articulated their hostility to\nSSP and their desire to stop disbursing SSP funds, even if disbursement is consistent with\n34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 36 of 50\ncongressional purpose. The City, even if ultimately successful here, risks a permanent loss of\nthese funds because of Defendants' $80 million money grab.\n126. In addition, given that the noncompliance letter references the SSP23 grant funds\nfor which the City was previously reimbursed, Defendants may attempt to unlawfully execute\nanother money grab for the SSP23 funds. Hence the City seeks an injunction to require the\nrepayment of the $80 million in SSP24 funds, and an injunction to prevent Defendants from\nanother money grab of the SSP23 funds.\n127. The illegitimate suspension of the SSP24 and SSP23 grants on pretextual grounds\nalso harms the City, as there remain additional funds from which the City may draw down, if it\nsubmits eligible costs for reimbursement. The SSP24 grants awarded to the City include an\nadditional $1 million; while the SSP23 grant includes an additional $36.3 million. Denial of\nthose funds to the City on grounds, conditions, or terms other than those provided in the SSP\ngrantAward Letters and NOFOs would likewise result in harm to the City, its budget, and its\nfinances.\nI28. Defendants'conduct as described above, including the money grab and the\nfunding pause based on a pretextual administrative \"noncompliance\" letter, demonstrate the\nfutility of pursuing an administrative appeal of the \"noncompliance\" letter.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nI\nCount \nSubstantive APA Violation\nArbitrary and Capricious; Abuse of Discretion\n(Against Agency Defendants)\nI2g.

To the extent FEMA officials and other federal officials offered rationales for the\nmoney grab on social media, in public statements, and in lawsuits to which the City is not a\nparty, these rationales are unsupported, and offer no legitimate basis for FEMA s action.\nl3g. To the extent the \"noncompliance\" letter purports to offer further rationales for the\nmoney grab and/or the withholding, it does not add anything, is pretextual, unsupported, and\noffer no legitimate basis for FEMAs action.\n140. Furthermore, all the rationales offered are inconsistent with and directly contrary\nto the statutory text of the DHS Appropriations Act and the stated goals of the SSP, which\ninclude providing funds to local govemments that provide food, shelter and other services for\nmigrants recently released by DHS into the community, in order to facilitate the safe, orderly,\nand humane release of noncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.\nl4l.

By letter dated February ll,z}zs,Defendants provided the city a\n'ononcompliance\" letter concerning a \"withholding\" of funds that did not identifu any\nnoncompliance by the City. Rather, it announced purported \"Findings,\" expressed as no more\nthan \"concems\" and which are, in any event, facially pretextual and unsupported. The\n\"noncompliance\" letter requests information that is not related to the asserted concerns and seeks\ninformation that, for the most part, has already been provided by the City, reviewed by FEMA'\nand determined to be sufficient for payment. The letter advises City OMB of o'the right to appeal\"\nwithin 60 days. This pretextual \"noncompliance\" letter does not provide the City with the\nprocedural protections to which it is entitled.\n42\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 12     Filed 02/24/25     Page 44 of 50\n169.

Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution, the government may not deprive a person or entity of a protected property interest\nwithout due process of law.\n174. Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief \"with respect\nto violations of federal law by federal officials.\" Armstrong v.

The City has a protected properfy interest in the $80 million that Defendants\ngrabbed back from the City's bank account and in the SSP23 funds it has been awarded and\nwhich have been disbursed to the City.\nI76. Defendants'conduct in implementing the FEMAmoney grab deprived the City of\nits property interest without providing notice or a pre-deprivation opportunity to be heard.\n177. While a post-deprivation opportunity to be heard would not be sufficient under the\ncircumstances, Defendants have not in fact provided a genuine post-deprivation opportunity to\nbe heard because the process being offered is pretextual and illusory. For example, while the\n\"noncompl ianse\" letter requests more information, that information is largely identical to the\ninformation that FEMA already reviewed and approved in connection with approving\ndisbursements to the City for the SSP24 and SSP23 grants. Additionally, the information\nrequested does not speak to the purported'oconcerns\"  articulated in the letter.\n178. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C . g 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the FEMA\nmoney grab and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding are contrary to law.\nI7g. In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to additional appropriate relief including (1)\nordering Defendants to reverse the FEMAmoney grab by returning the $80 million to the City's\nbank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City bank\naccount in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining Defendants\nfrom implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds.

Article I, Section I of the United States Constitution enumerates that: \"[a]ll\nlegislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall\nconsist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\" U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 1.\n182. \"As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that 'important subjects . . . must be\nentirely regulated by the legislature itself,'even if Congress may leave the Executive 'to act\nunder such general provisions to fill up the details.\"' West Wrginia v.

Indeed, FEMA officials have\nacknowledged that they are refusing and will continue to refuse to effectuate the DHS\nAppropriations Act, thus acting contrary to law.\n185. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C .

Plaintiff seeks preliminary relief\nwith respect to (1) and (2).\nCount VI\nSpending Clause\n(Against All Defendants)\n187. The City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.\n188. The Spending Clause provides that Congress-not the Executive--o'shall have\nPower to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the\ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .\" lJ.S.

United States,\n435 U.s. 444 (1e78)).\nl9l.  FEMA's money grab and withholding violate the Spending Clause because the\nexecutive branch has overridden the careful judgments of Congress by imposing purported new\nconditions and requirements on SSP funding that are inconsistent with the DHS Appropriations\nAct, the SSPAward Letters, the NOFOs and the Code of Federal Regulations as incorporated by\nreference into the SSP grant documents.\nlg2.

On Tuesday, February ll , 2025, at 4:03 pm, the long arm of the federal\n1 \ngovernment reached into a central bank account of the City of New York (the \"City\") and\ngrabbed $80,481,86L.42.Ittook these funds from the City without any advance notice that it\nwould be doing so and without communicating any decision or rationale to the City.\n2.  Defendant U.S. Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (\"FEMA\") took back\nthe funds it paid the City on February 4,2025, even though it had thoroughly reviewed and\nanalyzedthe extensive supporting documentation submitted by the City and approved payment\nas reimbursement for eligible and compliant expenditures under two federal grants awarded\nunder the Shelter and Services Programs (\"SSP\").\n3.  Indeed, FEMA offered and awarded the grants and reviewed and approved the\npayment to the City, to offset allowable costs the City incurred for shelter and services it\nprovided to noncitizen migrants who were processed and released into the community by\ndefendant the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). FEMA's stated purpose in\noffering the grants-to \"relievfe] overcrowding in short-term holding facilities of U.S. Customs\nand Border Protection\"-is  the exact purpose for which the City used the funds.\n4.  These funds were appropriated by Congress for the purpose of making SSP grants\navailable nationwide to local governments and non-profit organizations in border states, such as\nTexas and Arizona, andother locales, like New York City, receiving the largest influxes of\nmigrants released by DHS.\nI\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 3 of 50\n5.  Before FEMA transferred these funds to the City on February 4, FEMAhad\nalready reviewed the City's grant applications and awarded the grants, reviewed and approved\nthe City's budget for each glant, and reviewed and approved the City's reimbursement request,\nwhich included extensive detail as to each migrant who received services and back-up\ndocumentation validating the costs incurred.\n6.  Despite the fact that FEMAhad reviewed and approved the City's request, and\nissued payment, Defendants grabbed the money back without any administrative  process\nwhatsoever. Indeed, as of the moming of February 18,2025, FEMAs platform for grant making\nand administration, entitled \"FEMA GO\" (an acronym for \"FEMA Grant Operations\"),\ncontinued to indicate that the City's approved request for $80,481 ,861.42 was disbursed to the\nCity.\n7.  Defendants have made it clear in contemporaneous public statements that they\nopposed the very purpose for which SSP funds were appropriated by Congress and approved by\nFEMA and that they intended to make sure the funds were recouped and never paid.\n8.  For example, defendant Cameron Hamilton, Senior Official Performing the Duties\nof the FEMAAdministrator posted on February 10,2025,the day before the money grab:\n\"@USCongress  should have never passed bills in 2023 and2024 asking FEMAto do this work. .\n. . Thi s stops now. \" https : l l x. coml F EMA-Cam/ stattts 1 1 888923 67 2 523 489 649 .\ng. \nLikewise, defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in announcing the previous\nday's money {ab,posted on February 12,2025: \"I have clawed back the full payment that\nFEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to NYC migrant hotels.\"\nstiN 4575\n2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 4 of 50\n10.  The statements could not be clearer: Defendants'purpose for grabbing back the\nfunds was not related to the City's specific expenditures at all, but to thwart the very purpose of\nthe SSP.\n11.  No lawful procedure permits Defendants-as they did here-to take back grant\nfunds previously approved and paid without legitimate basis and without first following and\ncomplying with the steps required under the applicable rules, grant terms and conditions.\nDefendants have acted lawlessly, but have attempted, after the fact, to mask this fact with a\nsemblance of following procedure.\n12.  First, several hours after grabbing the funds back from the City, Defendants,\nincluding DHS and FEMA, filed papers in a federal court proceeding in Rhode Island requesting\nthat court's confirmation that Defendants may permissibly \"withhold\" FEMA funding, and\nrepresented to that court that they intended to provide \"notice to New York City regarding the\nfunding pause and will provide the information and process required by regulation and the terms\nand conditions of the award.\" Defs.' Emergency Motion, New Yorkv. Trump,No. 1:25-cv-00039\n(D.R.I. Feb. 11,2025),ECF No. 102. FEMAdid not tell the Court that, far from merely\n,'withholding\" funds, it had already, just hours earlier, taken back from the City funds that it had\npreviously approved and Paid.\n13.  Further, having stated publicly that it was opposed to spending the funds\naltogether, and having taken the funds without following any lawful process whatsoever, FEMA\nnonetheless represented to the Court that it sought to \"withhold\" funding solely ooon the basis of\nthe applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.\" Id.Yetatthatpoint, FEMAhad not\ncomplied with any applicable statutes, regulations, and glant terms and conditions and had taken\nback funds in violation of the same.\nJ\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 5 of 50\n14.  Next, a week later, in a post hoc effort to adorn defendants' lawless money grab\nwith a veneer of administrative  process, Administrator Hamilton sent the City's Office of\nManagement and Budget (\"City OMB\"), which administers the FEMA grants for the City, a\n\"Remedy forNoncompliance  Letter\" dated February 18,2025 (\"noncompliance\" letter) that\npurports to set forth \"Findings\" of significant concern that the SSP funds are going towards\n\"illegal activities.\" FEMA sent this letter just days after the City publicly announced its intention\nto sue over the money grab.\n15.  Simply put, the \"noncompliance\" letter is pretextual, a cover for Defendant's real\nintent, which-as they've stated publicly-is to withhold the funds permanently because they\noppose the purposes for which the funds were appropriated, awarded, approved, and paid. The\nof\nletter, relying only on unsubstantiated characterizations of \"media reports,\" makes allegations \ncrime and gang activity at the Roosevelt Hotel---one of the many locations for which FEMA\nreimbursed the city for shelter and services. Tellingly, the letter omits any mention that FEMA\nofficials twice visited the Roosevelt Hotel in Septemb er 2024 and that those visits did not lead to\nany findings of alleged criminal activity. In addition, Defendants fail to cite any regulatory\nauthority that supports denying funding to the City under the SSP based on purported criminal\nactivity by those released by DHS into the community when the City has been assisting DHS in\nproviding shelter.\n16.  Further, the letter makes a show of requesting information to further a purported\nreview of the City's SSP awardsfor2024  and2023 (\"SSP24\" and \"SSP23\",and collectively\n,'SSP awards\"), but mainly seeks information that OMB previously provided to FEMA, and that\nFEMA already reviewed and approved in order to determine that the claimed reimbursements\nwere allowable. Indeed, while the letter alleges the City is somehow encouraging illegal\n4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 6 of 50\nimmigration, FEMA already confirmed in approving and issuing the payment that all funds were\nused to provide services to individuals who DHS had released from its custody into the\ncommunity.\n17.  The letter does not identiff any applicable rules or grant terms or conditions with\nwhich it alleges the City might not have complied. Instead, the letter effectively - and improperly\n- adds new terms and conditions. The letter is meant to look like it affords the requisite\nadministrative process when, in fact, the decision has already been made to deny payment to the\nCity because Defendants do not want to pay the City for providing the very services to the very\npeople for the very pu{poses that Congress appropriated the funds and FEMA awarded the grants\nand approved and made the payments.\n18.  This lawsuit challenges two actions by Defendants based on two core contentions.\nFirst, Defendants'money-grab-after  FEMAreview, approval, and actual payment, without\nnotice or process of any kind-was, simply put,lawless. It violated federal regulations and grant\nterms, was contrary to law and in excess of authority, and contrary to their obligations to\nimplement Congressional appropriations.\nlg.  Second, Defendants February 18,2025 withholding letter likewise violates the\nlaw. Indeed, despite Defendants'representations  to the federal court in Rhode Island that they\nwere withholding FEMA funding from the City in accordance with applicable rules, grant terms\nand conditions, and not pursuant to a \"fundingfreeze\" or'opause\" of the type that is temporarily\nrestrained in that case, they are using the post hoc pretense of regular administrative  procedure to\nmask that they are in fact acting pursuant to a broad \"freeze\" or \"pause\" on SSP funding. This\nappears to be part of an overarching strategy of finding ways to get around the TRO in New York\n5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 7 of 50\nv. Trump and refuse to spend funds specifically authorized by Congress for this express purpose\neven after those funds were previously approved and actually paid by the very same agency.\n20.  Because Defendants took the extraordinary and lawless measure of seizing money\nfrom the City's bank account-by surprise, and without notice-the City seeks the extraordinary\nremedy of mandatory injunctive relief to compel Defendants to return the money to the City'\nrestoring the status quo ante. Such remedy is necessary because funds paid through\nCongressional appropriation  are not fungible-if not disbursed, they can be reappropriated, or\nthe appropriation  may expire before this case is resolved, leaving the City without recourse.\nDefendants, notwithstandingthe post hoc pretense of administrative  process, have made it\nabundantly clear that they intend to withhold permanently every dime FEMApreviously\nawarded, approved for reimbursement, and paid to the City.\n21.  Defendants also seek relief to make sure that Defendants do not improperly grab\nmore money from the City and do not improperly withhold funds that the City is entitled to\nrecelve.\n22.  Therefore, the City brings this suit for a declaration that the money grab and the\nwithholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds are each arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, ultra\nvires and in excess of authority, without observance of lawful procedures, and each violates the\nDue Process Clause, the separation of powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause.

Congress Appropriated Funds for Local Governments to Assist in Providing Shelter\nand Services to Migrants Released by DHS into the Community\n36.  In2019, as part of the federal government's response \"to the significant rise in\naliens at the southwest border,\" Congress authorized FEMA to provide grants to local\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations  assisting migrants encountered by DHS at the southern\nborder and released into the community. These grants were only available to'Jurisdictions or\nlocal recipi ent organizations serving communities  that have experienced a significant influx\" of\nmigrants and covered the provision of food, shelter, basic medical care, and transportation. These\ngrants were provided through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Progtam Humanitarian\n(\"EFSP-H\"). See Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian  Assistance and\nSecurity at the Southern BorderAct, Pub. L. No. 116-26,Title III, 133 Stat. 1020-21(2019).

The NOFO\nreleased on April 12,2024 announced $300 million in round 1 allocations and the amended\nNOFO released on August 28,2024 announced round 2 (Reserve Fund) allocations. New York\nCity was allocated $38.86 million for round I and $20.4 million for round 2.\n45.  Millions of dollars were also allocated for non-profit organizations and local\ngovemments across the country including more than $60 million for specified cities, counties,\nand not-for-profits in Texas, $10.8 million for Fulton County, Georgia, $11.6 million to Maricopa\nCounty, Adzona, and $21.8 million to Pima County, Arizona.\n46.  The remaining $340.9 million was released through SSP-C grants. See SSP-A\nNOFO at 5; SSP-C NOFO at 7.

The City opted to receive grant payments on a reimbursement basis, meaning that\nthe grantee must obtain FEMA s approval of a grant budget-namely the line items of expected\nexpenditures for which reimbursement will be made-and only following budget approval, the\ngrantee may submit a documented request for reimbursement for approved expenditures that\nhave already been made.\n15\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 17 of 50\n60.

Following a review process, FEMA approved the City's SSP24 grant budgets on\nJanuary 8 and 10,2025, respectively.\n63.  On January 14,2025, City OMB submitted to FEMA a request for reimbursement\nof $22,169,838.00 of expenditures for its Fiscal Year 2024 SSP-C grant and on January 15,2025,\nCity OMB submitted to FEMA a request for reimbursement of costs in the amount of\n85g,302,125.07 for its Fiscal Year 2024 SSP-A grant, together representing the entirety of the\nSSP grant awards to the City for Fiscal Yeat 2024.\n64. \nIn support of the payment requests, City OMB submitted all of the\ndocumentation required by FEMA including the name and A-Number for each individual, and\ninvoices and other documentation  of expenditures'\n65.  On January 3I,2025, following its review of the City's submissions, FEMA\ninformed the City that the reimbursement for the SSP grants would need to be reduced slightly to\naccount for an error rate of roughly 1.22% in matching theA-Numbers to eligibility for\nreimbursement and indicated that it would approve and make payment upon a request for the\nreduced amount.\nt6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 18 of 50\n66.  The City resubmitted to FEMArevised payment requests for the two gtants in the\namounts of $58,581 ,446.08 and $21,900,415.34,respectively, as pre-authorized by FEMA. The\namounts in the revised payment requests reflected a reduction of l.22oh from the City's initial\npayment requests to account for FEMA s 1.22o/o error rate finding. The remaining balance-\nroughly $l million between the two grants-remains available for future reimbursement of\nallowable expenses based on a subsequent submission.\n67.  On February 4,2025,the City received payments by ACH wire transfer to the\nCity's central treasury account of $58,581,446.08 and $21,900,415.34, the full amount that\nFEMAhad approved for reimbursement to the City.\n68.  FEMA's approval and payment of these amounts constitutes FEMAs\ndetermination-after  thoroughly reviewing budget details, expenditure documentation, and\npersonal information of migrants-that the funds FEMA approved and disbursed were allowable\nunder the grant terms and conditions.\nC.

FEMA did not provide any advance notice to the City of the money grab. FEMA\ndid not follow any of the measures set forth in the grant terms and conditions or the regulations\nrelevant to the grant.

Nor did FEMA provide any advance notice of any reason or basis to the City for\nthe money grab. Indeed, it did not communicate with the City at all before taking the funds.\nD. Federal Officials Make Pubtic Statements Opposing SSP\n72.  While FEMA did not communicate directly with City OMB before or\nimmediately after its money grab either to warn that it intended to take the money or to provide\nany reasons why, outside the grant administration  process, various federal officials-including\nElon Musk, an unelected and unconfirmed individual who appears to be leading the Department\nof Govemment Efficiency (\"DOGE\"), defendant Kristi Noem, the Secretary of the Department of\nHomeland Security, and defendant FEMAActing Administrator Cameron Hamilton-made\npublic statements condemning SSP and touting the FEMAmoney grab on social media, in press\nreleases, and in court proceedings to which the City is not aparty. These statements make\nunsupported claims regarding the FEMA funding received by the City and do not identify any\nlawful ground for FEMA to ignore Congress's intent and the applicable rules and grant terms and\nconditions and grab back the money it awarded, approved, and paid to the City.\n73.

Defendants openly articulated their hostility to SSB their unwillingness to\nadminister the program, and their intention to take back the SSP funding. However, Defendants\no'pause, \nare subject to at least one temporary restraining order ordering them not to  freeze,\nimpede, block, cancel, or terminate Defendants'compliance with awards and obligations to\nprovide federal financial assistance ...except on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes,\nregulations, and terms\" and to \"comply with all notice and procedural requirements in the award,\nagreement, or other instrument relating to decisions to stop, delay, or otherwise withhold federal\nfinancial assistance programs.\" New Yorkv.

That TRO was entered in a case filed by 22 states (including New York) seeking to\ntemporarily restrain and enjoin the across-the-board  pause on federal funding disbursement\nimplemented by the Trump administration.  See generally New Yorkv. Trump, No. 25-cv-39-JJM-\nPAS (D.R.I. filed Jan.28,2025)  (hereinaftet \"New Yorkv. Trump\").\n82.  In granting the TRO, the Rhode Island court noted that the Defendants identified\nno authority allowing them to unilaterally suspend the payment of federal funds or to impose\nconditions on appropriated funds beyond what Congress had authorized, and that the Court was\n*ll.\nnot otherwise aware of any.

To evade these obligations and create cover for the money grab, at approximately\n7 p.m. on February l1,2025-three hours after FEMAhad already grabbed $80M from the\nCity's bank account without notice-some of the defendants here filed a motion in New York v.\nTrump entitled, ooEmergency Motion. . . for Permission to Continue Withholding FEMA and\nOther Funding.\"\n85.  The emergency motion purported to seek confirmation that a \"withholding\" of\nFEMA funding to the City did not violate the TRO.\n86.  Without mentioning that FEMAhad already taken from the City funds that FEMA\nhad approved and transferred to the City a fulI week earlier, the emergency motion stated that\n,'FEMA seeks to withhotd Shelter and Services Program (SSP) funding based on concerns\nregarding the program\" and \"respectfully requests confirmation that Defendants may permissibly\n23\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 25 of 50\nwithhold certain FEMA funding, i.e., as 'a specific instance where they are acting in compliance\nwith this Order but otherwise withholding funds due to specific authority.\"' Id. (emphasis added)'\n87.  In a declaration accompanying the emergency motion, FEMAActing\nAdministrator Hamilton represented that FEMA had \"paused\" SSP funding because of concerns\nthe funds were being mis-used by the City and that FEMAwould follow all applicable processes\nunder the SSP grant and applicable laws and regulations. Specifically, Administrator Hamilton\nmade the following representations:\no \n\"As of today, the Department has paused funding to the Shelter and Services\nProgram based on significant concerns that the funding is going to entities\nengaged in or facilitating illegal activities.\"\no \n\"For example, a substantial portion of Shelter and Services Program money\ngoes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.\nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has\ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of\noperations to plan a variety of crimes.\"\no  ooFEMAis in the process of requesting information from New York City to\nfurther investigate this matter to ensure that federal funds are not being used\nfor illegal activities.\"\no \n\"FEMA will begin the process of providing notice to New York City regarding\nthe funding pause and will provide the information and process required by\nregulation and the terms and conditions of the award.

The Hamilton Declaration also attached a memo from DHS Secretary Kristi\nNoem, stating that all funding to non-governmental organizations (\"NGOs\") for services that\n\"touch in any way on immigration\" including SSP were \"paused.\" Kristi Noem, Mem. for\nComponent and Office Heads (Jan.28,2025) (ooNoem Memo\"), available as ECF No. 102-2 in\nNew Yorkv.

The Noem Memo explained that, in Noemns view, the \"[DHS] has spent\n24\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 26 of 50\nbillions of dollars funding illegal immigration,\" including by funding NGOs that \"purport[] to\nprovide a variety of services to illegal aliens.\" In pausing the NGO funding for SSR Secretary\nNoem makes clear her opposition to the program itself.\n89.  The Hamilton Declaration relied on \"media reports,\" rather than on any fact-based\nanalysis. It did not identifu any activity by the City that was inconsistent with SSP24 grant\nconditions or unlawful, except for vague allegations of encouraging aliens to reside in the U.S.,\ntransporting illegal aliens, harboring, or aiding and abetting. Since all of the migrants for whom\nFEMAreimbursed  the City were released into the community by DHS with anANumber, and\nthe reimbursement was for the express purpose of relieving DHS of the burden of maintaining\nthese individuals in DHS custody, these assertions are misleading and without merit.\n90.  The Hamilton Declaration did not inform the court that FEMAhad already, three\nhours before the emergency motion was filed, grabbed back $80 million in SSP funds from the\nCity without complying with any of the notice or procedural requirements in the SSPAward\nLetters, NOFOs or the applicable federal regulations.\ngl. \nThe Hamilton Declaration cites 2 C.F.R. S 200.242,but that provision does not\nexist. 2 C.F.R. 5 200.342,however,  requires that an agency that \"initiatfes] a remedy for\nnoncompliance  (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective action plan, or termination)'.. must\nprovide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the\naction.\" No such opportunity was provided before FEMAtook the money.\n92.  The Court denied the emergency motion on February 12,2025, stating:\nAs to FEMA funds to New York City, the Defendants represent that they\nintend to provide 'notice to New York City regarding the funding pause and\nwill provide the information and process required by regulation and the terms\nand conditions of the award.'ECF No. 102-l atfl 13. Because the Defendants\nare seeking to terminatefunding 'on the basis of the applicable authorizing\n25\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 27 of 50\nstotutes, regulations, and terms,'ECF No. 50 at 12 (emphasis added), the\nCourt sees no need for further clarification.\nOrdet New Yorkv.

The District Court of Rhode Island thus relied on Defendants'representation  that\nthey were seeking to \"pause\" funding \"on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes,\nregulations and terms\" when, in fact, far from merely pausing funding, Defendants had already\ngrabbed back funds that had been paid to the City, and had done so without providing notice to\nthe City and without following any of the applicable statutes, regulations and terms.\n94.  The day after the filing in the Rhode Island case, on February 12,2025, at l:37\npm, defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem repeated the unsupported statements in the Hamilton\nDeclaration, that persons residing in hotels the City used to temporarily shelter non-citizen\nmigrants committed crimes and that approved SSP funds were grabbed back for that reason.\nhttps://x.com/ItuistiNoem/status/1  88974575292407408  8.\ntt\n0 (l\nKristi Noem \n@KristiNoem\nI have clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activists\nunilaterally gave to NYC migrant hotels.\nFEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua\nbase of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer.\nMark my words: there will not be a single penny spent that goes against\nthe interest and safety of the American people.\nc\nQ s.sr tJ zrr Q rror f,l r:r\n26\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 28 of 50\nF. FEMA Issued a,'Noncompliance Lettero'in a Pretense of Procedural Compliance\n95.  More than a week after the money gtab, Defendants began to manufacture a\nveneer of the procedural compliance that Administrator Hamilton had represented in court filings\nthey were following. On February 19,2025,Neil Thompson, the Deputy Assistant Director at\nCity OMB, received a letter, dated February 18,2025, from FEMAActing Administrator\nHamilton with the subject line 'oRemedy for Noncompliance Letter, Shelter and Services\nProgtam (SSP).\"\n96.  In the letter, Administrator Hamilton purports to \"notifu fCity OMB] that\nDHS/FEMAis  temporarily withholding payments to fCity OMB]\" for three grant awards: the\nFY24 SSP-Agrant award of $59,302,125.07,theFY24  SSP-C gtant award of $22,169,838.00,\nand an SSP grant award the City received for FY23 in the amount of $106,879,743.00 (\"SSP23\nGranf'). The letter admits that FEMAhad already grabbed back the SSP-A and SSP-C grant\nawards paid to the City, stating that FEMA \"recovered two payments completed via direct\ndeposit on February 4,2025,totaling $80,481,861.42.\" The letter claims that the money grab\n\"constitutes a part of this temporary withholding.\"\n97.  The letter states that DHS/FEMA is withholding funds pursuant to 2 C.F.R.\n$ 200.339(a), which states that \"[w]hen [a] Federal agency . . . determines that noncompliance\ncannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency . . . may . . . (a)\ntemporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes corrective action.\" But\nthe letter also states, inconsistently with the above, that FEMA \"is instituting specific conditions\non fthe City's] award pursuant to 2 C.F.R. $ 200.208.\" As noted above, 2 C.F.R. $ 200.208\nallows federal agencies to adjust specific conditions in the Federal award based on analysis of the\nfollowing factors:\n27\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 29 of 50\n(1) Review of OMB-designated  repositories of govemment-wide data (for\nexample, SAM.gov) or review of its risk assessment (See $ 200.206);\n(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and\nconditions of Federal awards;\n(3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance\ngoals as described in $ 200.211; or\n(4) A determination  of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate\nfinancial capability to perform the Federal award.\n98.  The letter fails to note, however, that FEMAmay not initiate a remedy for\n'ononcompliafice,\" such as withholding funds, without providing notice to the City and an\nopportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. 2 C.F.R. S 200'342.\nIgnoring that rule, FEMA not only instituted a withholding, it took back funds it had already\nawarded, approved, and paid before commencing any administrative process whatsoever.\ngg. \nThe letter also omits reference to regulations providing that \"payments for\nallowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance  unless\nrequired by Federal statute, regulations,\" or \"The recipient ... has failed to comply with the terms\nand conditions of the Federal award; or... is delinquent in a debt.\" CFR $ 200.305(b)(6)\n(emphasis added). If \"such conditions\" aro met, \"the Federal agency... may, after providing\nreasonable notice,withhold payments to the recipient... until the conditions are conected.\" Id.\nAnd in the event payments are withheld for noncompliance, they must be released'tpon\nsubsequent compliance.\" 2 CFR $ 200.305(bX7).\n100. Here, FEMA has not identified any federal statute or regulation that requires\nwithholding of SSP grant funds, nor has it identified any grant terms or conditions with which\nDefendants allege the City has not complied. Whatever the supposed violation, Defendants have\nnot made a final determination  following notice and opportunity to be heard.\n28\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 30 of 50\n101. Instead, even taking the letter at face value, the stated reasons for withholding\nfunds are based on specious and unsubstantiated allegations unrelated to any grant terms or\nconditions.\n102. The \"noncompliance\" letter announces purported \"Findings,\" which are expressed\naS no more than \"concems\" and which are, in any event, facially pretextual.\n103. First, the letter states that DHS \"has significant concerns that SSP funding is\ngoing to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities.\" But it does not allege any purported\nillegal activities committed by any entity that might have been paid with funds for which the City\nobtained reimbursement. Instead, the letter alleges-citing and exaggerating the same news\nreports that defendant Hamilton cited in his declaration a week earlier:\nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has\ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of\noperations to plan a variety of crimes. According to these same reports, these\ncrimes include gun and drug sales as well as sex trafficking, which can\nreasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself.\nlO4. The letter asserts that \"DHS/FEMA has a responsibility to ensure that it does not\nmake payments that fund criminal activity\" but, as FEMAknows, the grant does provide\noofinancial support to non-federal entities to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen\nmigrants following their release from the Department of Homeland Security.\" FEMA, Shelter\nand Services Program, https://wwwfema.gov/erants/shelter-services-program (last visited Feb.\nt3,2025).\n105. A further \"finding\" is FEMA's purported \"concern\" that\nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging\nor inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in\nviolation of law, 8 u.s.c. $ 132a(a)(l)(A)(iv); transporting or moving illegal\naliens, id. $ 1324(a)(t)(A)(ii);  harboring, concealing, or shielding from\n29\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 31 of 50\ndetection illegal aliens, id. $ 1324(axlXA)(iii); or applicable conspiracy,\naiding or abetting, or attempt liability respecting these statutes.\n106. As FEMAknows, this is a patently false \"concern\" because the grants fund only\nthose costs for shelter and services that are provided to individuals that DHS determined to\nrelease from its custody into the community. That is, the individual was already in the United\nStates, in DHS custody, and then released by DHS to the community-facts that FEMA\nconfirmed for each individual before, and as a condition of, making payment.\n107. The \"noncompliance\" letter claims that \"[b]ased bn the concerns described . . . ,\nDHS/FEMAwill  conduct additional monitoring and review of'the FY23 andFY24 SSP awards\n'oas permitted by the terms and conditions of the award(s) to ensure compliance with all terms\nand conditions of [the] award(s).\" The letter reiterates that \"[d]uring this time, payments under\nthe grant award(s) will be temporarily held. This action includes the amount of funding . . . that\nDHS/FEMA recently clawed back.\" The 'ononcompliance\" letter adds that \"[u]pon the conclusion\nof that monitoring, FEMAwill notifu you of the results and any other remedies for\nnoncompliance  or specific conditions, as appropriate.\"\n108. The o'noncompliance\" letter makes a show of requesting information that would\nsomehow assist FEMAin making a final determination. But the information requested is largely\ninformation that FEMA not only has, but has already reviewed in determining to make payment\nto the City. The letter seeks:\nAll documents regarding the aliens with whom your organization  and your\nsubrecipients and contracts interacted with in carrying out the scope of your\nSSP award, including their names and contact information; and a detailed and\ndescriptive list of specific services provided, and proof of provision of these\nservices; or\nA written statement that your organization has already submitted all of the\ninformation identified in No. 1, above, to DHS/FEMA.\n30\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 32 of 50\n109. As noted above, the City supplied the name and A-Number for individuals for\nwhom the City sought reimbursement, as well as proof of services rendered-all of which FEMA\nreviewed and approved for payment. Further, none of the information requested is in any way\nrelated to the letter's stated central o'concern\": allegations of criminal activity. It is a charade of a\nrequest for information, not a meaningful request'\nG. The,oNoncompliance\"  Letter Wrongly Implicates the Fiscal Year 2023 SSPAward\n110. The'Noncompliance  Letter\" references the SSP23 grant, though it is unclear\nwhether and to what extent FEMA s \"findings\" concem that grant. Indeed, FEMA already\nconducted a \"Compliance Review\" with respect to the SSP23 Grant and made findings, afact\nomitted from the \"Noncompliance Letter.\" Despite having conducted a financial and\nprogrammatic site visit-including at the Roosevelt Hotel-FEMA did not identifu in its\nCompliance Review Findings any of the matters now set forth in the \"noncompliance\" letter.\n1l l.  As background: FEMA awarded the City $106.9 million under the SSP23 grant\nand, to date, has reimbursed the City $70.6 million for allowable costs under the grant.\nIl2.  As with the SSP24 Grants, FEMAs stated purpose in offering the SSP23 Grant\nwas:\nTo provide funding to non-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants\nrecently released from DHS custody to temporarily provide shelter, food,\ntransportation, acute medical care, personal hygiene supplies, and labor\nnecessary to manage cases to provide these services; and,\nTo provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to\ntemporarily shelter noncitizen migrants recently released from DHS custody,\nincluding renovations and modifications to existing facilities.\nThe SSp23 NOFO further states FEMA s \"priority\" of the \"safe, orderly, and humane release of\nnoncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.\"\n3l\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 33 of 50\nI 13. The City applied for the SSP23 Grant on July 12,2023. FEMA initially awarded\nthe City a granlof $104.7 million by notice effectiveAugust 11,2023, which it increased to\n$106.9 million on September 28,2023.As with the applications for the SSP24 Grants, the City's\napplication for the SSP23 Grant included a list of all the locations for which the City indicated it\nmight seek reimbursement, including the Roosevelt Hotel.\nIl4.  OMB submitted two requests for partial reimbursement under the SSP23 Grant.\nFEMA approved the City's first reimbursement request in the amount of $25.5 million on July\n25,2024. FEMA approved the City's second reimbursement request in the amount of $45.1\nmillion on January 7,2025. To date, the City has received $70.6 million in reimbursement from\nFEMAunder the SSP23 Grant. Under the grant terms, $36.3 million remains available for\nclaiming reimbursement of allowable costs.\n115. As with the FY24 SSP-A and SSP-C Grants, OMB submitted to FEMAthe name,\nA-Number, and other information for each individual for whom the City's cost of providing\nshelter and services was included in the reimbursement request. In addition, for the SSP23 Grant,\nOMB was required to include the DHS Release Date (the date DHS released each individual\nfrom DHS custody) because, per the gtant terms, FEMA would only reimburse for shelter and\nservices provided within 45 days of release. FEMAreviewed all of this information in\ndetermining that the City's reimbursement request was for allowable costs and in determining to\nmake the payment.\n116. In stark contrast with thepo st hoc pretextual process around FEMA s money grab,\nFEMAhad previously initiated a compliance review audit of the first payment made under the\nSSP23 Grant that included a'Joint financial and progtamming site visit.\" As part of the visit,\nofficials from FEMA and the Customs and Border Protection toured the Roosevelt Hotel and\n32\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 34 of 50\nanother facility on Septemb er 9,2024.Apart from the Compliance Review, FEMA officials\nvisited the Roosevelt Hotel on September 26,2024.\nlI7.  On November 29,2024, FEMAprovided its findings to OMB by letter. FEMA\nmade findings in three areas: (1) data privacy protections forANumbers, (2) contract provisions,\nand (3) certain financial management issues. Having visited the Roosevelt Hotel twice, FEMA\ndid not identifu any purported gang or illegal activities at the Roosevelt Hotel in its Compliance\nReview Findings.\n18. FEMA has conducted zero additional visits to the Roosevelt Hotel. The recent\n1 \n\"noncompl ianse\" letter provides no first-hand account in support of FEMA s allegations of\ncriminal activity and instead relies solely on characterizations of unsubstantiated media reports.\nThat is not a proper process and is indicative that Defendants have determined not to fund the\nCity's SSP grants under any circumstances and are seeking to create a paper trail to mask the fact\nthat the determination  is not related to \"noncompliance\" or to any proper grounds for\nwithholding funds.\nH. FEMA is Bound by Extensive Rules and Procedures, Including in the Grant Terms\nand Conditions\n119. By grabbing back funding from the City, and suspending further funding under\nSSP24 and SSP23, FEMAhas acted contrary to the applicable rules and grant terms. There is\nnothing in the NOFOs, Award Letters, nor the applicable regulations, that allows Defendants to\n'orecover\" funds by taking them out of the City's bank account before going through an\nadministrative process that includes notice and an opportunity to object.\n120. Furthermore, Defendants'supposed  administrative determination  to suspend\nSSP24 and SSP23 funding is plainly pretextual, as it does not identifr any legitimate basis for\nwithholding SSP funding - let alone for having taken back funds that were previously approved\nJJ\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 35 of 50\nand paid. Instead, it makes specious allegations unrelated to the grant terms, asks for submission\nof information that City OMB already provided and that FEMA already reviewed in detail, and\nfails to cite any grant term with which the City has not complied.\nI.  The Money Grab Violates Federal Rules and Grant Terms and Conditions\nI2I.  As described above, FEMA did not provide any notice to City OMB before the\nmoney grab.\n122. The money grab was made in total disregard of the fact that FEMA awarded the\ngrant and then reviewed, approved, and paid the reimbursement.\n123. No lawful grounds exist-and none have been asserted-for the money gtab, and\nno lawful procedure was followed. Instead, defendants have made clear that their true intent is to\nhalt the program entirely because they do not like it, and have commenced a post hoc\n\"procedure\" to give legal gloss to their unlawful determination  and action. The money grab must\nbe reversed and defendants prevented from engaging in unlawful money grabs in the future.\nJ. The City Faces lrreparable Harm\nI24.  The over $80 million grabbed back by Defendants is reimbursement for amounts\nthat the City already expended in reliance on the SSP's terms, and that FEMA awarded, reviewed\nin detail, approved for payment, and paid to the City.\n125. Because of Defendants'money grab, the City is at risk of losing this funding\npermanently even if it prevails in this lawsuit. SSP funds could become unavailable to the City\nduring the time it takes to decide this lawsuit, if the SSP appropriation  is fully obligated (i.e. the\nCity's funds are redistributed to other recipients) and thus exhausted; the appropriation expires;\nor if the appropriation is rescinded by Congress. Defendants have articulated their hostility to\nSSP and their desire to stop disbursing SSP funds, even if disbursement is consistent with\n34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 36 of 50\ncongressional purpose. The City, even if ultimately successful here, risks a permanent loss of\nthese funds because of Defendants' $80 million money grab.\n126. In addition, given that the noncompliance letter references the SSP23 grant funds\nfor which the City was previously reimbursed, Defendants may attempt to unlawfully execute\nanother money grab for the SSP23 funds. Hence the City seeks an injunction to require the\nrepayment of the $80 million in SSP24 funds, and an injunction to prevent Defendants from\nanother money grab of the SSP23 funds.\n127. The illegitimate suspension of the SSP24 and SSP23 grants on pretextual grounds\nalso harms the City, as there remain additional funds from which the City may draw down, if it\nsubmits eligible costs for reimbursement. The SSP24 grants awarded to the City include an\nadditional $1 million; while the SSP23 grant includes an additional $36.3 million. Denial of\nthose funds to the City on grounds, conditions, or terms other than those provided in the SSP\ngrantAward Letters and NOFOs would likewise result in harm to the City, its budget, and its\nfinances.\nI28. Defendants'conduct as described above, including the money grab and the\nfunding pause based on a pretextual administrative \"noncompliance\" letter, demonstrate the\nfutility of pursuing an administrative appeal of the \"noncompliance\" letter.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nI\nCount \nSubstantive APA Violation\nArbitrary and Capricious; Abuse of Discretion\n(Against Agency Defendants)\nI2g.

Moreover, \"courts may not accept ... counsel's post hoc rationalizations for\nagency action\" or otherwise \"supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency\nitself has not given.\" Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n,463 U.S. at 43,50. Rather, \"an agency's action\nmust be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.\" Id.\n137. Here, Defendants have provided the City no reason or basis at all for grabbing\n$g0 million from the City's bank account for costs FEMAhas already confirmed through review\nof extensive documentation were eligible for reimbursement under the SSP grants. Likewise,\n36\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 38 of 50\nDefendants have not offered any lawful basis for withholding the SSP24 and SSP23 grants.\nDefendants have not identified any costs that are not reimbursable under the SSP grants.\n138. To the extent FEMA officials and other federal officials offered rationales for the\nmoney grab on social media, in public statements, and in lawsuits to which the City is not a\nparty, these rationales are unsupported, and offer no legitimate basis for FEMA s action.\nl3g. To the extent the \"noncompliance\" letter purports to offer further rationales for the\nmoney grab and/or the withholding, it does not add anything, is pretextual, unsupported, and\noffer no legitimate basis for FEMAs action.\n140. Furthermore, all the rationales offered are inconsistent with and directly contrary\nto the statutory text of the DHS Appropriations Act and the stated goals of the SSP, which\ninclude providing funds to local govemments that provide food, shelter and other services for\nmigrants recently released by DHS into the community, in order to facilitate the safe, orderly,\nand humane release of noncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.\nl4l.  An action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency \"failed to consider. . .\nimportant aspects of the problem\" before it. Depl of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of\nCalifurnia,5gl U.S. 1,25 (2020) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs.,463 U.S. at43). Here,\nDefendants demonstrated no consideration of the City's substantial reliance interests in receiving\nfunds to reimburse the City for monies already spent housing and providing services to non-\ncitizenmigrants in compliance with the grant terms and requirements. Where, as here, \"an\nagency changes course ... it must 'be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered\nserious reliance interests that must be taken into account.\"' Id.

In addition, Plaintiffis entitled to additional appropriate relief under 5 U.S.C.\ng 705 including (1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMAmoney grab by retuming the $80\nmillion to the City's bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from\nany City bank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining\nDefendants from implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds. Plaintiff seeks\npreliminary relief with respect to (1) and (2).\nII\nCount \nSubstantive APA Violation\nContrary to Lawo Ultra Vireso and in Excess of Statutory Authority\n(Against Agency Defendants)\n145. The City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.\n146. Defendants include \"agenc[ies]\" under the APA. 5 U.S.C. $ 551(1).\n147. The FEMAmoney grab is agency action subject to review under theAPA.\n148. The withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding is agency action subject to review\nunder the APA.\nl4g. Under the APA, a court must \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings,\nand conclusions found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,\"\n38\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 40 of 50\nor \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\" 5\nu.s.c.  706(2xB) - (c).\n$$ \n150. Neither the President nor an agency can take any action that exceeds the scope of\ntheir constitutional and/or statutory authority.\n151. Congress enacted the APA \"as a check upon administrators whose zeal might\notherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.\"\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369,391 (2024) (quoting U.,S. v. Morton Salt,\n338 U.S. 632,644 (1950)). Moreover, \"section 706 makes clear that agency interpretations of\nstatutes-like agency interpretations of the Constitution-are not entitled to deference.\" Id. at\n392 (emphasis in original). Rather, it \"remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether\nthe law means what the agency says.\" Id. (quoting Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass'n,575 U.S.\n92,109 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)).\n152. The DHS Appropriations Act authorizing the SSP grants appropriated funds for\nthe purpose of providing monies to local govemments that provide food, shelter and other\nservices for migrants recently released by DHS into the community, in order to facilitate the safe,\norderly, and humane release of noncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.\nDefendants cannot unilaterally grab back or refuse to disburse funds appropriated by Congress\ncontrary to congressional intent and directive.\n153. Moreover, the Impoundment  Control Act of IgT4requires the Executive to make\nappropriated funds \"available for obligation,\" subject to only two exceptions: rescissions and\ndeferrals. 2 U.S.C. $$ 633-84. Deferrals may not be made for policy reasons, and rescissions are\nsubject to congressional approval. Id. $ 684(b).\n39\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 41 of 50\n154. The FEMA money grab is neither a lawful rescission nor a lawful deferral under\nthe Impoundment Control Act. It is not a lawful rescission because lawful rescissions are subject\nto congressional approval,id. $ 684(b), and the President has not sought conglessional approval.\nIt is not a lawful deferral because Defendants made clear that the FEMAmoney grab was\nmotivated by a policy disagreement  with the SSP. As the D.C. Circuit has explained, the\nExecutive lacks the statutory authority to engage in policy-based deferrals that would'onegate the\nwill of Congress.\" City of New Havenv. United States,809 F.2d 900,901 (D.C.Cir. 1987).\n155. Likewise, FEMA's withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding is neither a lawful\nrescission nor a lawful deferral under the Impoundment  Control Act. It is not a lawful rescission\nbecause lawful rescissions are subject to congressional approval, and the President has not\nsought congressional approval. It is not a lawful deferral because Defendants made clear that it\nwas motivated by their hostility to the stated purpose of the congressional appropriation and their\ndetermination not to make SSP payments.\n156. Under 5 U.S.C. g 706 and28 U.S.C. $ 2201, Plaintiffis entitled to a declaration\nthat the FEMA money grab violates the APA because it is contrary to law, ultra vires, and in\nexcess of statutory authority.\n157. Under 5 U.S.C. g 706 and28 U.S.C. 5 2201, Plaintiffis entitled to a declaration\nthat FEMA s withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding violates the APA because it is contrary to\nlaw, ultra vires, and in excess of statutory authority.\n158. In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to additional appropriate relief under 5 U.S.C.\n$ 705 including (1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMAmoney grab by returning the $80\nmillion to the City's bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from\nany City bank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining\n40\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 42 of 50\nDefendants from implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds.

FEMA's withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding is agency action subject to\nreview under the APA.\n162. The FEMA money grab is agency action subject to review under the APA.\n163.

Neither the DHS Appropriations Act, the SSP grant Award Letters, the NOFOs\nnor the Code of Federal Regulations, incorporated into the SSP grant documents, permit\nDefendants to grab back funds duly disbursed by FEMAto the City pursuant to and in\naccordance with the SSP grants'terms and conditions. Neither do they allow Defendants to\nwithhold payment of funds that were approved pursuant to and in accordance with the SSP\ngrants' terms and conditions.\n165. To the extent Defendants may have had any legitimate concems about the City's\nperformance under the SSP grants , they were required to follow the procedures available under\nthe SSP GrantAward Letters, the NOFOs and the Code of Federal Regulations, incorporated into\nthe grant documents. But they did not do so.\n4t\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 43 of 50\n166. Prior to grabbing back $80 million, Defendants did not provide the City with\nnotice of any agency determination  of non-compliance,  any specific conditions to be applied to\nthe City SSP grants, nor any grant suspension, pause or termination. 2 C.F.R. $$ 200.208,\n200.243;200.305; 200.339 - 200.342. Nor did FEMA offer the City any opportunity to contest\nany agency determinations.ld.  S 200.342.\n167. FEMArepresented to the Rhode Island District Court as of February 11,2025 that\nFEMAwas already \"in the procoss of requesting information from NewYork City to further\ninvestigate this matter\" and would \"provide[] notice\" to the City and \"provide the information\nand process required by regulation and the terms and conditions of the award.\" Hamilton\nDeclaration atlll2,l3.Butatthetimeoftheirfiling,FEMAhadalreadygrabbedthe$80\nmillion from New York City without providing notice, without requesting any information,\nwithout announcing any findings, and without following any required process.\n168. By letter dated February ll,z}zs,Defendants provided the city a\n'ononcompliance\" letter concerning a \"withholding\" of funds that did not identifu any\nnoncompliance by the City. Rather, it announced purported \"Findings,\" expressed as no more\nthan \"concems\" and which are, in any event, facially pretextual and unsupported. The\n\"noncompliance\" letter requests information that is not related to the asserted concerns and seeks\ninformation that, for the most part, has already been provided by the City, reviewed by FEMA'\nand determined to be sufficient for payment. The letter advises City OMB of o'the right to appeal\"\nwithin 60 days. This pretextual \"noncompliance\" letter does not provide the City with the\nprocedural protections to which it is entitled.\n42\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 44 of 50\n169. Under 5 U.S.C. $ 706 and28 U.S.C. $ 2201, Plaintiffis entitled to a declaration\nthat the FEMAmoney grab violates theAPAbecause it is without observance of procedure\nrequired by law.\n170. Under 5 U.S.C. $ 706 and28 U.S.C. 5 2201, Plaintiffis entitled to a declaration\nthat FEMA's withholding of SSP 24 and SSP23 funding violates theAPAbecause it is it is\nwithout observance of procedure required by law.\n17l. In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to additional appropriate relief under 5 U.S.C.\ng 705 including (1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMA money grab by returning the $80\nmillion to the City's bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from\nany City bank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining\nDefendants from implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds. Plaintiff seeks\npreliminary relief with respect to (1) and (2).\nCount IV\nViolation of Due Process\n(Against All Defendants)\n172. the City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.\nI73. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution, the government may not deprive a person or entity of a protected property interest\nwithout due process of law.\n174. Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief \"with respect\nto violations of federal law by federal officials.\" Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, lnc.,575\nu.s. 320, 32617 (2015).\n43\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 45 of 50\n175. The City has a protected properfy interest in the $80 million that Defendants\ngrabbed back from the City's bank account and in the SSP23 funds it has been awarded and\nwhich have been disbursed to the City.\nI76. Defendants'conduct in implementing the FEMAmoney grab deprived the City of\nits property interest without providing notice or a pre-deprivation opportunity to be heard.\n177. While a post-deprivation opportunity to be heard would not be sufficient under the\ncircumstances, Defendants have not in fact provided a genuine post-deprivation opportunity to\nbe heard because the process being offered is pretextual and illusory. For example, while the\n\"noncompl ianse\" letter requests more information, that information is largely identical to the\ninformation that FEMA already reviewed and approved in connection with approving\ndisbursements to the City for the SSP24 and SSP23 grants. Additionally, the information\nrequested does not speak to the purported'oconcerns\"  articulated in the letter.\n178. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C . g 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the FEMA\nmoney grab and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding are contrary to law.\nI7g. In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to additional appropriate relief including (1)\nordering Defendants to reverse the FEMAmoney grab by returning the $80 million to the City's\nbank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City bank\naccount in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining Defendants\nfrom implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds. Plaintiff seeks preliminary relief\nwith respect to (1) and (2).\nCountY\nSeparation of Powers\n(Against All Defendants)\n180. The City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.\n44\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 46 of 50\n181. Article I, Section I of the United States Constitution enumerates that: \"[a]ll\nlegislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall\nconsist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\" U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 1.\n182. \"As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that 'important subjects . . . must be\nentirely regulated by the legislature itself,'even if Congress may leave the Executive 'to act\nunder such general provisions to fill up the details.\"' West Wrginia v. EPA,597 U.S. 697 '737\n(2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quotingWaymanv. Southard, 10Wheat.I,42-43,6L.Bd.253\n(1825)).\n183. The separation of powers doctrine thus represents perhaps the central tenet of our\nconstitution. See, e.g., Trump v. United States,603 U.S. 593,637-38 (202Q; West Wrginia v.\nEPA,5g7 U.S. at 723-24. Consistent with these principles, the executive acts at the lowest ebb of\nhis constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary to the express or implied will of\nCongress. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Savvyer,343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring).\n184. FEMA s money grab and withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds violates the\nseparation of powers because the executive branch has overridden the careful judgments of\nCongress by taking back funding and withholding funding, without legitimate basis or\njustification, that was specifically authoized and appropriated under the DHS Appropriations Act\nand was used by the City for the purposes set forth in that Act. Indeed, FEMA officials have\nacknowledged that they are refusing and will continue to refuse to effectuate the DHS\nAppropriations Act, thus acting contrary to law.\n185. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C . S 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the FEMA\nmoney grab and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding are contrary to law.\n45\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510     Document 1     Filed 02/21/25     Page 47 of 50\n186. In addition, Plaintiffis entitled to additional appropriate relief including (1)\nordering Defendants to reverse the FEMAmoney grab by retuming the $80 million to the City's\nbank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City bank\naccount in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining Defendants\nfrom implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds. Plaintiff seeks preliminary relief\nwith respect to (1) and (2).\nCount VI\nSpending Clause\n(Against All Defendants)\n187. The City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.\n188. The Spending Clause provides that Congress-not the Executive--o'shall have\nPower to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the\ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .\" lJ.S. Const. Art.

States and localities must have fair notice of conditions,\nand once funds have been accepted pursuant to a federal spending program, the Federal\ngovoffiment cannot alter the conditions attached to those funds so significantly as to\n\"accomplishl ] a shift in kind, not merely degree.\" Nat'l Fed'n of Indep.

Furthermore, conditions must be \"reasonably related to the pu{pose of the\nexpenditure.\" New Yorkv. United States,505 U.S. 144,172 (1992) (citing Mass. v. United States,\n435 U.s. 444 (1e78)).\nl9l.  FEMA's money grab and withholding violate the Spending Clause because the\nexecutive branch has overridden the careful judgments of Congress by imposing purported new\nconditions and requirements on SSP funding that are inconsistent with the DHS Appropriations\nAct, the SSPAward Letters, the NOFOs and the Code of Federal Regulations as incorporated by\nreference into the SSP grant documents.\nlg2.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 220l,Plaintiffis entitled to a declaration that the money\ngrab and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funding are contrary to law.\nlg3.  In addition, Plaintiffis entitled to additional appropriate relief including (1)\nordering Defendants to reverse the FEMA money grab by returning the $80 million to the City's\nbank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City bank\naccount in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining Defendants\nfrom implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds.

This\n\"Money Grab\" was the opening salvo in a multi-speared effort by the Trump administration to\ndeprive the City, by unlawful means and for illegitimate reasons, of as much as $186 million in\npreviously-awarded  grant funding.\n2. \nA week earlier, on February 4,2025,Defendant  U.S. Federal Emergency\nManagementAgency (\"FEMA\") paid $80,481,861.42 to the City after FEMAthoroughly\nreviewed the extensive supporting documentation submitted by the City and approved payment\nunder two federal grants that FEMA awarded under the Shelter and Services Prograrns (\"SSP\").\n3. \nThe federal government seized the City's funds using anAutomatic Clearing\nHouse (\"ACH\") reversal, a process in which the originator of an ACH electronic funds transfer\ninitiates a request to reverse a payment that has already been processed. Originators are\npermitted to use the ACH reversal process under very limited and essentially ministerial\ncircumstances not present here, such as to reverse a duplicate payment, a payment made to an\nincorrect recipient, or a payment made in the incorrect amount.\n4. \nPursuant to Congressional appropriation and all applicable regulations, the money\nwas rightfully the City's. FEMA offered and awarded the SSP grants to offset costs the City\n1\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 3 of 84\nincurred for shelter and services it provided to noncitizen migrants who were processed and\nreleased into the community by defendant the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\").\nThe purpose of SSP, as FFMA stated, was to \"reliev[e] overcrowding in short-term holding\nfacilities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection\"- the exact purpose for which the City used\nthe funds.\n5. As Congress intended, the SSP grants were made to local governments and non-\nprofit orgatnzations in border states, such as Texas and Arizona, and other locales, like New York\nCity, receiving the largest influxes of migrants released by DHS. The City received these now-\nseized funds only ona reimbursement basis for eligible and compliant expenditures already\nincurred to provide shelter and services to noncitizen migrants.\n6. Before FEMA transferred these funds to the City on February 4,2025,FEMA had\nalready determined that the funds were eligible for reimbursement: FEMA reviewed the City's\ngrant applications and awarded the grants, reviewed and approved the City's budget for each\ngrant,and reviewed and approved the City's reimbursement request, which included extensive\ndetail as to each migrant who received services and back-up documentation  validating the costs\nincurred.\n7. Despite the fact that FEMA had reviewed and approved the City's request, and\nissued payment, Defendants grabbed the money back without any administrative process\nwhatsoever. Indeed, as of the moming of February 18,2025, FEMA s platform for grant making\nand administration, entitled \"FEMA GO\" (an acronym for'\"FEMA Grant Operations\"),\ncontinued to indicate that the City's approved request for $80,481 ,861.42 was disbursed to the\nCity.\n2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 4 of 84\n8. \nDefendants made it clear in a series of contemporaneous  public statements that\nthey oppose the very purpose for which SSP funds were appropriated by Congress and approved\nfor reimbursement by FEMA and that they intended to undermine Congressional intent in\nenacting and funding SSP and make sure the SSP funds were recouped and are never paid:\ncameron Hamilton, then-Senior official performing the Duties of the\nFEMAAdministrator, posted on February 10,2025,the day before the\nMoney Grab: \"@USCongress should have never passed bills in 2023\nand2024 asking FEMAto do this work. . . . This stops now.\"\na Hamilton similarly advised the court in this action that he believes ..on\nits face, ssP funds sheltering and transportation of illegal aliens.\"\na Defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in announcing the previous\nday's Money Grab, posted on February I2,2025:.,I have clawed back\nthe full payment that FEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to\nNYC migrant hotels.\"\nhttps://x.com/KristiNoem/status/1  889745752924074088.\nDefendant President Donald rrump told congress and the nation that\nSSP, and payments to the City thereunder, was a o,scam\" and he\nbragged about recouping the money and terminating the program.\nS\n75 1 bs89 a3265tr1e5cl 1fef7c\n9. \nThese and other statements lay bare Defendants'deep-seated  animosity to SSp\nitself as well as to the City. The intent could not be clearer: Defendants'aim  in grabbing back the\nfunds was not related to the City's specific expenditures or grant compliance at all, but to thwart\nthe very purpose ofthe SSP and to prevent and take back expenditures thereunder to the\nmaximum extent possible and to deprive the City of SSP funds whenever and however they\ncould manage it.\n10. Defendants have acted lawlessly in taking money from the City's account. No\nlawful procedure permits Defendants to simply take back grant funds previously approved and\npaid in the manner that they did here. Any review of a grant recipient's compliance with the\na\nJ\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 5 of 84\ngrant's requirements must be done in a manner that is consistent with regulatory procedures,\nwhich do not allow the government to misuse the ACH system to seize money it has already\napproved and paid.\n11. Separate and apart from that initial illegal act, Defendants have since started a\nseries of processes designed to permanently lay claim to the funds, and indeed all SSP funds that\nCongress appropriated and FEMA awarded to the City, under the mask of a pretextual\ncompliance review and unlawful termination of the program.\n12. First, several hours after grabbing the funds back from the City, Defendants,\nincluding DHS and FEMA, filed papers in a federal court proceeding in Rhode Island requesting\nthat court's confirmation that Defendants.may permissibly \"withhold\" FEMA funding from the\nCity, and represented to that court that they intended to provide \"notice to New York City\nregarding the funding pause and will provide the information and process required by regulation\nand the terms and conditions of the award.\" Defs.'Emergency Motion, New Yorkv. Trump,No'\n1:25-cv-00039 (D.R.I. Feb. 11,2025),ECF No. 102. FEMA did not tell the Court that, far from\nmerely \"withholding\" funds, it had already, just hours earlier, unilaterally and without any notice\ntaken funds from the City's bank account in the amount that it had previously approved and paid.\n13. Further, having stated publicly that it was opposed to'spending the funds\naltogether, and having taken the funds without following any lawful process whatsoever,  FEMA\nnonetheless represented to the Court that it sought to \"withhold\" funding solely o'on the basis of\nthe applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.\" Id. YeIFEMA had not complied with\nany applicable statutes, regulations, and grant terms and conditions and had illegally taken funds\nfrom the City in violation of the same. And, in the same breath, FEMA conceded to the Court\nthat it had paused SSP generallY.\n4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 6 of 84\n14. Between February 10 and 122025, Defendants also zeroed-out all the funds\nremining in the City's SSP grants for all years, including the over $80 million in the Money\nGrab, on one platform, USASpending.gov,  without informing the City. As the funds continued to\nbe shown as available on \"FEMA GO,\" FEMA's dedicated platform for administering  the SSP\ngrants, the City only learned the funds were zeroed out much later, when FEMA GO was no\nlonger available and City offrcials visited USASpending.gov,  the \"official open data source of\nfederal spending information, including information about federal awards such as contracts,\ngrants, and loans,\" and saw that all of its SSP money had disappeared from that platform and that\n\"obligations\" to the City under the SSP grants for 2024had been reduced to \"0.\" This zeroing\nout was surprising for the additional reason that Defendants had, in the interim, made multiple\nrepresentations  - in letters and court proceedings - that SSP funds were merely being\ntemporarily withheld.\n15. Next, a week later, Hamilton sent the City's Office of Management and Budget\n(\"City OMB\"), which administers the FEMA grants for the City, a \"Remedy for Noncompliance\nLetter\" dated February I8,2025 (\"Remedy for Noncompliance  Letter\") that purports to set forth\n\"significant concems\" that the SSP funds are going towards \"illegal activities,\" even though\nFEMA had already reviewed and approved reimbursement for the exact activities funded by SSP.\nFEMA sent this letter just days after the City publicly announced its intention to sue over the\nMoney Grab.\n16. Simply put, the Remedy for Noncompliance Letter is pretextual, a cover for\nDefendants'Money  Grab and for Defendants' suspension of the SSP. They have made clear their\nintent to withhold the funds permanently because they oppose the purposes for which the funds\nwere appropriated, awarded, approved, and paid. The letter, relying only on unsubstantiated\n5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 7 of 84\ncharacterizations  of \"media reports,\" makes allegations of crime and gang activity at the\nRoosevelt Hotel--one of the many locations for which FEMAreimbursed  the city for shelter and\nservices. Tellingly, the letter omits any mention that FEMA officials twice visited the Roosevelt\nHotel in September 2024 and that those visits did not lead to any findings of alleged criminal\nactivity. In addition, Defendants fail to cite any regulatory authority that supports denying\nfunding to the City under the SSP based on purported criminal activity by those released by DHS\ninto the community.\n17. Further, the letter makes a show of requesting information to further a purported\nreview of the City's SSP awards for 2024 and2023 (\"SSP24\" and \"SSP23\" and collectively\nooSSP awards\"), but mainly seeks information that City OMB previously provided to FEMA, and\nthat FEMA already reviewed and approved in order to determine that the claimed\nreimbursements were allowable. Indeed, while the letter alleges the City is somehow\nencouraging illegal immigration, FEMA already confirmed in approving and issuing the payment\nthat all funds were used to provide services to individuals who DHS had released from its\ncustody into the community\n18. The letter does not identifu any applicable rules or grant terms or conditions with\nwhich it alleges the City might not have complied. Instead, the letter effectively -- and\nimproperly -- adds new terms and conditions. The letter is meant to look like it affords the\nrequisite administrative process when, in fact, the decision has already been made to deny\npayment to the City because Defendants do not want to pay the City for providing the very\nservices to the very people for the very purposes that Congress appropriated the funds and\nFEMA awarded the grants and approved and made the payments.\n6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 8 of 84\n19. Defendants appear to have sent similar letters to many other local government\nSSP recipients. Defendants, having conceded in numerous court filings that SSP was suspended,\nappear to have adopted the fig leaf of compliance review to cover the fact that they had\neffectively halted SSP in its entirety. Neither Defendants'Money  Grab from the City nor their\nsuspension of SSP has anything to do with City-specific grant compliance, but is instead the\nresult of Defendants'new-found hostility to the very grants they awarded.\n20. Then, with the purported compliance review apparently uncompleted, FEMA\nannounced onApril I,2025,that it was terminating SSP entirely. FEMA stated that it was\nterminating the City's SSP award for the entirely different reason that the grants \"no longer\neffectuate [] the program goals or agency priorities\" (quoting 2 C.F.R.  200.340(a)(2) (2020)).\n$ \nBut the regulation FEMA cited does not permit a federal agency to cancel a grant program\nfunded by Congressional appropriation  simply because it has changed its mind and now opposes\nthe program\n21. Not only that. While FEMA s termination letter provides for a closeout process at\nthe end of which FEMA will determine whether any additional SSP grant funds are owed the\nCity, all SSP funds that were awarded the City and that would have remained available to make\nany such payment were apparently zeroed out on USASpending.gov  more than six weeks earlier.\n22. Collectively, these events make plain that Defendants determined to overturn the\nCongressional appropriation,  deny the City SSP funds, and re-take any funds they could find a\nway to lay their hands on. The subsequent compliance review and termination are no more than\npost hoc efforts to provide a paper cover for the unlawful and unauthorized determination  and\naction Defendants already made.\n7\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 9 of 84\n23. This lawsuit challenges multiple final actions taken by Defendants. First,\nDefendants' Money Grab-after FEMA review, approval, and actual payment, without notice or\nprocess of any kind-was, simply put, lawless. It violated federal regulations and grant terms,\nseparately had no justification in the rules governing ACH electronic funds transfers, was\ncontrary to law and in excess of authority, and contrary to their obligations to implement\nCongressional appropriations.\n24. Second, this lawsuit challenges a series of subsequent actions Defendants took in\nfurtherance of their determination  to override entirely Congress's establishment and\nappropriation  of SSP. These include Defendants'suspension  and subsequent termination of the\nCity's SSP awards and Defendants' use of a pretextual compliance review process to mask and\nprovide legal cover to the suspension. They also include Defendants'acts in an apparent effort to\nzero out all remaining funds awarded to the City. Defendants characterize the suspension as a\n\"pause\" or \"freeze\" or a \"withholding,\" when in fact they set out to stop SSP in its tracks and\nterminate it, with respect to the City and with respect to local govemment grant recipients more\ngenerally, and give a bogus veneer of administrative  process to their unlawful and unauthorized\nactions.\n25. Defendants, notwithstanding  thep ost hoc pretense of administrative  process, have\nmade it abundantly clear that they intend to deprive the City permanently of every dime FEMA\npreviously awarded, approved for reimbursement, and paid to the City.\n26.lheCity also seeks relief to make sure that Defendants do not improperly\nwithhold funds that the City is entitled to receive.\n27. Therefore, the City brings this suit for a declaration that the Money Grab, the\nsuspension of SSP, the pretextual compliance review, the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23\n8\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 10 of 84\nfunds, the zeroing out of SSP funds, and the Termination Letter and ultimate termination of SSP\nin its entirety, collectively and each individually violate the Administrative Procedure Act and\nthe U.S. Constitution. Individually and collectively, these acts are arbitrary and capricious,\ncontrary to law, ultra vires and in excess of authority, without observance of lawful procedures,\nand violate the Due Process Clause, the separation of powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause.\nDeclaratory and injunctive relief is needed to prevent the harm that would result from\nDefendants' unlawful retention of the $80 million they improperly took and from Defendants'\nunlawful actions to deprive the City of funds it is entitled to receive and keep per Congressional\nappropriation  and pursuant to applicable regulations and the applicable grant terms and\nconditions.\nPARTIES\n28.

FEMA s stated purpose in offering the SSP23 Grant was:\nTo provide funding to non-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants\nrecently released from DHS custody to temporarily provide shelter, food,\ntransportation, acute medical care, personal hygiene supplies, and labor\nnecessary to manage cases to provide these services; and,\nTo provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to\ntemporarily shelter noncitizen migrants recently released from DHS custody,\nincluding renovations and modifications to existing facilities.\nNotice of Funding Opportunity (\"NOFO\") for SSP23 at 6.

FEMA issued the SSP23 NOFO on June 12,2023. The City, acting through City\nOMB, applied for the SSP23 Grant on July 12,2023. FEMA initially awarded the City a grant of\n$ 104.7 million by notice effective August lI , 2023, which FEMA increased to $ 1 06.9 million on\nSeptember 28,2023. The City's application for the SSP23 Grant included a list of all the\nlocations for which the City indicated it might seek reimbursement, including a location called\nthe Roosevelt Hotel.\n46.InMay 2023,the City began using the Roosevelt Hotel - which had closed as a\nhotel for guests in Decemb er 2020 -- as an Arrival Center for noncitizen migrants released by\nDHS into the U.S., and as a Humanitarian  Response and Relief Center as part of the City's\nresponse to the influx of noncitizen migrants released by DHS. Ihe facility functioned as a\ncentralized intake center for noncitizen migrants who were newly aniving in New York City\nfollowing their release by DHS and it provided them with a variety of supportive services\nincluding short-terni shelter.\n47. City OMB submitted two requests for partial reimbursement under the SSP23\nGrant.\n48. In connections with both reimbursement requests, City OMB submitted to FEMA\nthe name, Alien Registration Number (\"A-Number\"), and other information for each individual\nto whom the City provided eligible services for which the City was seeking reimbursement under\nthe grant.2 This reimbursement information included the date DHS released each individual from\n2 The requirement that A-Numbers be submitted to FEMA may be in response to a March 28,\n2023 reportissued by the DHS Office of Inspector General conceming a different program, the\nEmergency Food and Shelter Program (\"EFSP\"), entitled \"FEMA should Increase Oversight to\nPrevent Misuses of Humanitarian Relief Funds.\" See ECF No. 17-1, Ex. 3 (\"OIG Report\"). The\nOIG Report found in part that in administering  the EFSP, FEMA did not adequately ensure that\nlocal grant recipients in Califomia, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas provided adequate\n13\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 15 of 84\nDHS custody (\"DHS Release Date\"). Per the grant terms, FEMAwould only reimburse the City\nfor shelter and services provided within 45 days of the individual's release. FEMA reviewed all\nof this information in determining that the City's reimbursement request was for allowable costs\nand in determining to make the payment. Pursuant to the grant award documents, FEMA\nprovided reimbursements to the City on a per diem basis, meaning that City OMB received a\npayment for a fixed amount per person for each night an individual received shelter and services\nthat were being reimbursed by FEMA. Fixed per diems were established separately for lodging,\nfood, and other types of eligible services.\n49. OnMay 21,2024, City OMB submitted its first request for reimbursement in the\namount of $32 million. FEMAreviewed the request and requested additional documentation\nwhich City OMB provided. On July 25,2024,FEMA  approved reimbursement in the reduced\namount of $25.5 million.\n50. FEMA initiated a compliance review audit of the first payment request under the\nSSP23 Grant that included a'Joint financial and programming site visit.\" As part of the visit,\nofficials from FEMA and CBP toured the Roosevelt Hotel and another facility on Septernber 9,\n2024.Apart from the Compliance Review, FEMA officials also visited the Roosevelt Hotel on\nSeptember 26,2024.\n51. On October 16,2024, City OMB submitted a second reimbursement request to\nFEMA in the amount of $45.1 million.\n52. OnNovember 29,2024, FEMA provided its compliance review findings\nregarding the SSP23 Grant to OMB by letter. FEMA made findings in three areas: (1) data\ndocumentation concerning the individuals they served and that some families and individuals\nserved by EFSP did not have an encounter record with DHS.\nt4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 16 of 84\nprivacy protections forANumbers, (2) contract provisions, and (3) certain financial management\nissues. FEMA did not identify any purported gang or illegal activities at the Roosevelt Hotel in\nits Compliance Review Findings.\n53. FEMA approved and paid the City's second reimbursement request in the amount\nof $45.1 million on January 7,2025.To date, the City has received $70.6 million in\nreimbursement from FEMAunder the SSP23 Grant. under the grant terms, $36.3 million should\nremain available for claiming reimbursement of allowable costs.\nC. The SSP24 Grants\n54. On April12,2024,  FEMA issued two NOFOs for the $650 million Congress had\nappropriated for SSP24 Grants. One NOFO announced an allocation grant, meaning that the\namount the City and other specified local govemments and nongovemmental organizations could\napply for were pre-determined on an allocation basis (\"SSP-A Grant\").

On January 31,2025, following its review of the City's submissions, FEMA\ninformed the City that the reimbursement for each of the SSP24 grants would need to be reduced\nslightly to account for an error rate of roughly 1.22%in matching the A-Numbers to eligibility\nfor reimbursement and indicated that it would approve and make payment upon a request for the\nreduced amount.\n81. The City resubmitted to FEMA revised payment requests for the two grants in the\namounts of $58,581,446.08 and $21,900,4I5.3{,respectively as pre-authorized.by  FEMA. The\namounts in the revised payment requests reflected the reduction of 1.22% that FEMA required\nfrom the City's initial payment requests to account for FEMA's t.22Yo error rate finding. The\nremaining balance-roughly $1 million between the two grants-remained available for future\nreimbursement of allowable expenses based on a subsequent submission.\n82.

The Trump Administration Changes Policy and Unlawfully Freezes Federal Funding\n84. On January 20,2025,defendant President Donald Trump issued Executive Order\nl4I5g,entitled ooProtecting the American People Against Invasion\" (\"Invasion EO\"). The\nInvasion EO states that \"[o]ver the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered,\nand oversaw an unprecedented  flood of illegal immigration into the United States.\" As a result,\no'allowed \nthe EO asserts, \"[m]illions of illegal aliens\" crossed the border and were  to settle in\nAmerican communities.\" The EO states that many of the people the federal government admitted\nand allowed to settle here \"present significant threats to national security and public safety\" and\nthat many have \"abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United\nStates has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.\" Invasion EO $\n1.\n85. The Invasion EO further asserts that it is the \"the policy of the United States to\nachieve the total and efficient enforcement\" of its immigration laws and issues a wide-ranging\nseries of instructions to various persons and agencies within the federal government.\n86. The Invasion EO requires federal agencies to immediately pause funding to non-\ngovemment al orgaruzations providing services to \"illegal aliens. \" Invasion EO $ 19. The Attomey\nGeneral and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall:\n(a) Immediately review and, if appropriate, audit all contracts, grants, or\nother agreements providing Federal funding to non-govemmental\norganizations supporting or providing services, either directly or\nindirectly, to removable or illegal aliens, to ensure that such agreements\n22\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 24 of 84\nconform to applicable law and are free of waste, fraud, and abuse, and that\nthey do not promote or facilitate violations of our immigration laws;\n(b) Pause distribution of all further funds pursuant to such agreements\npending the results of the review in subsection (a) of this section;\n(c) Terminate all such agreements determined to be in violation of law or\nto be sources of waste, fraud, or abuse and prohibit any such future\nagreements;\n(d) coordinate with the Director of the office of Management and Budget\nto ensure that no funding for agreements described in subsection (c) of this\nsection is included in any appropriations request for the Department of\nJustice or the Department of Homeland Security; and\n(e) Initiate clawback or recoupment procedures, if appropriate, for any\nagreements described in subsection (c) of this section.\n87. The Invasion EO did not, on its face, order a comparable o'pause\" with respect to\nstate and local governments.\n88. On January 27,2025,the United States Office of Management and Budget issued\na \"Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\" entitled \"Temporary pause\nofAgency Grant, Loan, and other Financial Assistance\" (o'oMB Directive\").

On January 28,2025, Defendant DHS secretary Kristi Noem issued a\no'Memorandum for Component and Office Heads\" entitled \"Direction on Grants to Non-\ngovernmentalOrganizations\" ('Noem Memo\"). Echoing the Invasion EO, the Noem Memo\nstated that \"over the last four years, the Department of Homeland Security has spent billions of\ndollars funding itlegal immigrants.\" The Noem Memo went on to direct \"[e]ffective immediately,\nall [DHS] grant disbursements and assessments of grant applications that (a) go to non profit\norganizations or for which non-profit orgarrizations are eligible, and (b) touch in any way on\nimmigration, are on hold, pending review, except to the extent required by controlling authority.\"\nThe Noem Memo specified that the \"pause\" applied to SSP.\n91. Also on January 28,2025, a coalition of 22States, including the State of New\nYork, brought a lawsuit against various federal defendants in the District of Rhode Island\nseeking to temporarily restrain and preliminarily and permanently enjoin the across-the-board\npause on federal funding disbursement ordered in the OMB Memo.

Although the reversal was accomplished within the five-day\nwindow for reversals ofACH transfers under the rules and procedures governing automated\nclearinghouse (\"ACH\") transfers, those rules do not authorize reversals for the reasons\nDefendants effectuated it, as discussed further below.\n111.  FEMA did not provide any advance notice to the City of the Money Grab.\nFEMA did not follow any of the measures set forth in the grant terms and conditions or the\nregulations relevant to the grant.

Trump entitled,\n'oEmergency Motion. . . for Permission to Continue Withholding FEMA and Other Funding.\"\n115. \nThe emergency motion purported to seek confirmation that a\n\"withholding\" of FEMA funding to the City did not violate the TRO.\n116. \nWithout mentioning that FEMA had already taken the funds the\nemergency motion stated that \"FEMAseeks to withhold Shelter and Services Program (SSP)\nfunding based on concerns regarding the program\" and \"respectfully requests confirmation that\nDefendants may permissibly withhold certain FEMA funding, i.e., as 'a specific instance where\nthey are acting in compliance with this Order but otherwise withholding funds due to specific\nauthority. \"' Id. (emphasis added).\nll7. \nIn a declaration accompanying the emergency motion, then-Acting\nAdministrator Hamilton represented that FEMAhad o'paused\" SSP funding to the City because\nof concerns the funds were being mis-used by the City and that FEMA would follow all\napplicable processes under the SSP grant and applicable laws and regulations. Specifically, then-\nAdministrator Hamilton made the following representations \n:\no \n\"As of today, the Department has paused funding to the Shelter and Services\nProgram based on significant concems that the funding is going to entities\nengaged in or facilitating illegal activities.\"\no \n'oFor example, a substantial portion of Shelter and Services Program money\ngoes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.\nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has\ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of\noperations to plan a variety of crimes.\"\nJJ\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 35 of 84\n.  ooFEMA is in the process of requesting information from New York City to\nfurther investigate this matter to ensure that federal funds are not being used\nfor illegal activities.\"\no  .'FEMA \nwill begin the process of providing notice to New York City regarding\nthe funding pause and will provide the information and process required by\nregulation and the terms and conditions of the award.

Trump, Feb. 11,2025, ECF No. 102-1\n(\"Hamilton 2/ll Declaration\") nn 6, 7 , 12, 13 .The Hamilt on 2ll1 Declaration also attached the\nNoem Memo. As of the time the motion was filed, FEMAhad neither requested information\nfrom the City nor notified it that it was withholding funds or any reason it was doing so.\n118.  The Hamilton2lll Declaration relied on \"media reports,\" rather than on\nany fact-based analysis. It did not identiff any activity by the City that was inconsistent with\nSSP24 grant conditions or unlawful, except for vague allegations of encouraging aliens to reside\nin the U.S., transporting illegal aliens, harboring, or aiding and abetting. Since all of the migrants\nfor whom FEMAreimbursed  the City were, as FEMA itself determined, released into the\ncommunity with an assignedANumber  by DHS, and the reimbursement was for the express\npurpose of relieving DHS of the burden of maintaining these individuals in DHS custody, these\nooillegal\" \nassertions are faulty and appear to be disingenuous because there is nothing  about\nproviding shelter and services for specific individuals released from DHS custody as specified in\nthe grant.\n119.  The Hamilt on2lll Declaration represented only that, o'as of today\n[February 11,2025)-, FEMA had \"paused\" SSP and did not inform the court that FEMA had\nalready grabbed back the SSP24 funds without complying with any of the notice or procedural\nrequirements in the SSP Award Letters, NOFOs, or applicable federal regulations. The\nDeclaration did not mention the supposed and unsupported concerns that Musk and Hamilton\n34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 36 of 84\narticulated on February l0,2025,before the Money Grab, about SSP funds going to provide\n\"luxury\" accommodations to \"illegal aliens.\"\n120. \nThe Hamilt on2lIl Declaration cites 2 C.F.R. S 200.242,but that provision\ndoes not exist. If Hamilton meant to refer to 2 C.F.R. S 200.342,that provision requires that an\nagency that \"initiat[es] a remedy for noncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective\naction plan, or termination)... must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and\nprovide information challenging the action.\" No such opportunity was provided before FEMA\ntook the money. And nothing in the provision authorizes the unilateral reversal of an approved\nand completed payment to grab funds out of a grantee's bank account.\nI21r \nThe court denied the emergency motion on February 12,2025,stating:\nAs to FEMA funds to New York City, the Defendants represent that they\nintend to provide 'notice to New York City regarding the funding pause and\nwill provide the information and process required by regulation and the terms\nand conditions of the award.'ECF No. I02-I atfl 13.

On February 19,2025, Neil\nThompson, the Deputy Assistant Director at City OMB, received a letter, dated February 18,\n2025, from Hamilton with the subject line \"Remedy forNoncompliance  Letter, Shelter and\nServices Program (SSP).\"\n137. \nThe letter purports to \"notiff [city oMB] that DHS/FEMA is temporarily\nwithholding payments to [City OMB]\" for three grant awards: the SSP23 and both SSP24\nGrants.

(a) temporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes\ncorrective action.\" But the letter also states, inconsistently  with the above, that FEMA \"is\ninstituting specific conditions on [the City's] award pursuant to 2 C.F.R. $ 200.208.\"\n40\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 42 of 84\nI39. \n2 C.F.R. $ 200.208 allows federal agencies to adjust specific conditions in\nthe Federal award based on analysis of the following factors:\n(1) Review of oMB-designated repositories of government-wide  data (for\nexample, SAM.gov) or review of its risk assessment (See $ 200.206);\n(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and\nconditions of Federal awards;\n(3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance\ngoals as described in g 200.211; or\n(4) A determination of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate\nfinancial capability to perform the Federal award.\n140. \nNone of the foregoing factors are discussed in the Remedy of\nNoncompliance Letter nor do they appear to be within the scope of the concems set forth in the\nleffer.\nI4l. \nThe letter also fails to note that FEMA may not initiate a remedy for\noononcompliance,\" \nsuch as withholding funds, without providing notice to the City and an\nopportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. 2 C.F.R. S 200.342.\n142. \nThe letter also omits reference to regulations providing that \"payments for\nallowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of pedormance unless\nrequired by Federal statute, regulations,\" or \"The recipient ... has failed to comply with the terms\nand conditions of the Federal award; or... is delinquent in a debt.\" CFR $ 200.305(bX6)\n(emphasis added). If oosuch conditions'o are met, o'the Federal agency. ..mery, after providing\nreasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient... until the conditions are conected.\" Id.\notpon\nAnd in the event payments are withheld for noncompliance, they must be released \nsubsequent compliance.\" 2 CFR g 200.305(bX7).\n4I\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 43 of 84\n143.  Here, FEMA has not identified any federal statute or regulation that\nrequires withholding of SSP grant funds, has not identified a failure to comply with any grant\nterms or conditions, and did not provide notice, before grabbing back the funds.\n144.  Instead, even taking the letter at face value, the stated reasons for\nwithholding funds are based on specious and unsubstantiated allegations unrelated to any grant\nterms or conditions.\n145.  The Remedy of Noncompliance Letter announces purported \"Findings,\"\nwhich are expressed as no more than \"concerns\" and which are, in any event, facially pretextual.\n146.  First, the letter states that DHS \"has significant concerns that SSP funding\nis going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities.\" But it does not allege any\npurported illegal activities committed by any entity that might have been paid with funds for\nwhich the City obtained reimbursement. Instead, the letter alleges--citing and exaggerating the\nsame news reports that Hamilton cited in his declaration a week earlier:\nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has\ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of\noperations to plan a variety of crimes. According to these same reports, these\ncrimes include gun and drug sales as well as sex trafficking, which can\nreasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself.\n147.  The letter asserts that \"DHS/FEMA has a responsibility to ensure that it\ndoes not make payments that fund criminal activity.\" But the letter does not explain what \"illegal\nactivity\" might be funded by the grant. As FEMA knows, the grant provides \"financial support to\nnon-federal entities to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following\ntheir release from the Department of Homeland Security.\" FEMA, Shelter and Services Program,\nhttps://www.fema.gov/srants/shelter-services-program  (last visited Feb. 13, 2025). The grant\n42\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 44 of 84\ndoes not provide funds directly to any noncitizen migrants, nor to fund any activities not\nspecified within the grant terms.\n148.  o.finding\" \nA further  is FEMA s purported..concem', that\nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging\nor inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in\nviolation of law, 8 U.S.C. $ 132a(a)(1)(A)(iv); transporting or moving illegal\naliens, id. $ 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); harboring, concealing, or shielding from\ndetection illegal aliens, id. g 1324(a)(l)(A)(iii);  or applicable conspiracy,\naiding or abetting, or attempt liability respecting these statutes.\n149.  As FEMA knows, this is a patently false o'concern\" because the grants\nfund only those costs for shelter and services that are provided to individuals that DHS\ndetermined to release from its custody into the community. That is, the individual was already in\nthe United States, in DHS custody, and then released by DHS to the community-facts that\nFEMA confirmed for each individual before, and as a condition of, making payment.\n150.  In re-framing as illegal \"harboring\" or ootransporting\" the provision of\nshelter and services to noncitizenmigrants released by DHS into the U.S., the letter effectively\nand retroactively imposes new and grant-negating conditions by rendering grant compliance to\nbe unlawful.\n151. \nThe Remedy of Noncompliance Letter claims that \"[b]ased on the\nconcerns described . . . , DHS/FEMA will conduct additional monitoring and review of'the\nFY23 andFY24 SSP awards \"as permitted by the terms and conditions of the award(s) to ensure\ncompliance with all terms and conditions of [the] award(s).\" The letter reiterates that \"[d]uring\nthis time, payments under the grant award(s) will be temporarily held. This action includes the\namount of funding . . . that DHS/FEMA recently clawed back.\" The letter does not acknowledge\nthat the funds it represents are \"temporarily held\" were already subject to the Zero Out. The\nRemedy of Noncompliance  Letter adds that \"[u]pon the conclusion of that monitoring, FEMA\n43\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 45 of 84\nwill notiff you of the results and any other remedies for noncompliance or specific conditions, as\nappropriate.\"\n152.  The Remedy of Noncompliance  Letter makes a show of requesting\ninformation that would somehow assist FEMA in making a final determination. But the\ninformation requested is largely information that FEMA not only possesses but has already\nreviewed in determining to make payment to the City. The letter seeks:\nAll documents regarding the aliens with whom your organization and your\nsubrecipients and contracts [sic] interacted with in carrying out the scope of\nyour SSP award, including their names and contact information; and a detailed\nand descriptive list of specific services provided, and proof of provision of\nthese services; or\nA written statement that your organization has already submitted all of the\ninformation identified in No. I, above, to DHS/FEMA.\n153.  As described above, the City supplied the name and A-Number for\nindividuals for whom the City sought reimbursement, as well as proof of services rendered-all\n.of which FEMA reviewed and approved for payment. Furtherr none of the information requested\nis in any way related to the letter's stated central \"concem\": allegations of criminal activity. It is\na charade of a request for information.\n154.  By letter dated March 14,2025,the City responded to FEMA s\ninformation request, reserving all rights with respect to the issues it is raising in this litigation\nand in any appeal of the noncompliance letter itself.\nI.  Defendant Noem Amplifies Defendants'Hostility to SSP and to the City\n155.  Despite the TRO in place in N.Y. v. Trump, on February 19,2025,\nSecretary Noem issued another memo, titled \"Restricting Grant Funding for Sanctuary\nJurisdictions\" ('osecond Noem Memo\"). The Second Noem Memo ordered that:\n44\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 46 of 84\n(\nAll components are to review all federal financial assistance awards to determine\nif Department funds, directly or indirectly, &re going to sanctuary jurisdictions. To\nthe extent consistent with relevant legal authorities and the applicable terms and\nconditions of each award, each component must cease providing federal funding\nto sanctuary jurisdictions.\nSecond Noem Memo at 2.\n156. \nThe second Noem memo also contained the following statement:\nIf any government entity chooses to thumb its nose at the Department of\nHomeland Security's national security and public safety mission, it should not\nreceive a single dollar of the Department's money unless Congress has\nspecifically reQuired it.\n- \n157  Thus, the Second Noem Memo provides additional reasons, unrelated to\nthe SSP itself, as to why Defendants aim to deprive the city of SSP funds.\nJ. \nFEMA Doubles Down on Opposition to SSP and Demonstrates that the Money Grab\nwas Unjustified and Violated ACH Rules\n158. \nOn February 28,2025, then-Acting Administrator Hamilton, in a\ndeclaration submitted in this action, ECF No. 17-1 (\"Ham ilton2l2SDeclaration\"), asserted that\n\"on its face, SSP funds sheltering and transportation of illegal aliens.\" In so stating, Hamilton\nmade clear FEMA s opposition to SSP itself.\n159. \nHamilton further stated that no funds should have been disbursed to the\nCity following the Noem Memo because the memo put'oon hold\"all disbursements that \"touch\nin anyway on immigration\" and \"go to non-profit organiz,ations or fcrr which non-profits are\neligible.\" ECF No. l7-l n 8-9. Hamilton's reliance on the Noem Memo was telling: the Noem\nMemo used the purpose of the SSP - providing services to non-citizens - as a basis to \"pause\"\nthe SSP. The Noem Memo thus sought to stop SSP because Defendants reject its purpose; the\nMoney Grab, the pause, and the Zerc Outhad nothing to do with the City's compliance,\nparticularly since, in approving and paying reimbursement to the City on February 4,2025,\n45\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 47 of 84\nFEMA had already determined that the reimbursed costs complied with grant terms and\nconditions.\n160.  Furthermore, at the time of the Money Grab and the Remedy of\nNoncompliance  Letter, the Noem Memo was enjoined as an across the board unilateral pause in\nll\nfunding, by the TRO in New Yorkv. Trump. See supra. Significantly, in his February \ndeclaration filed in the Rhode Island case, Hamilton averred that the pause was imposed o'as of\n[that] day\" not as of the issuance of the Noem Memo.\n16l. \nThe Hamilton2l28 Declaration also stated for the first time -24 days after\nthe $80 million SSP payment to the City and l7 days after the Money Grab - that the payment\nwas made \"in error.\" ECF No. 17.I n 9. The allegation of a payment \"error\" appears to be an\nattempt to justiff the Money Grab as a legitimate \"reversal\" of the ACH transfer to the City's\naccount under applicable rules. However, Defendants did not make an \"error\" in paying the City;\nrather Defendants decided they did not like the SSP program and tried to reclaim whatever\nmonies they could without following agency procedures. That is not a proper basis for an ACH\nreversal and is not a proper basis for taking back money after approving the reimbursement.\n162.  Hamilton explained in his February 28 Declaration that the Money Grab\nwas executed by certifring over the phone to the Department of the Treasury that the SSP\npayment to the City was \"improper\" and by submitting to'oTreasury an Improper Recovery\nRequest via the Treasury Check Information System to recover the payment pursuant to 31\nC.F.R. $ 210.6(0.\" ECF No. l7-1 fl 11. However, Section 2I0.6(D does not permit a reversal of\nanACH transfer for a change of mind about policy; it permits a reversal for a \"duplicate or\nenoneous entry.\"\n46\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 48 of 84\n163. \nFEMA s decision to pay the City over $80 million after athorough review\nof the claims was not an \"erroneous entry.\" The Code of Federal Regulations incorporates by\n*202I \nreference the \"ACH Rules,\" defined as the  Operating Rules & Guidelines ... published by\nNacha,\" (the National Automated Clearing House Association).  31 C.F.R. 210.2(a)(\"Any term\nthat is not defined in [31 C.F.R. Part 210] shall have the meaning set forth in the ACH Rules\").\no'erroneous \nUnder the 202t Nacha rules, an  entry\" is defined as \"(a) a duplicate [of a previous\nentryl...(b) apaymentto orfrom aReceiver [who is notthe] ... Receiver... intended ... by the\nOriginator; (c) a payment in a dollar amount different than was intended by the Originator ... ; or\n(d) ta] payment of a debit Entry on a date earlier\" than intended by the Originator or a \"Credit\nEntry on a date later\" than intended by the Originator. NACHA Rule $ 8.38. e None of the\nreasons Defendants have articulated for the Money Grab are an allowable basis for an ACH\nreversal.\n164. \nHamilton's statements moreover are inconsistent with earlier statements\nby various defendants, including DHS Secretary Noem's February 12,2025X post, that make\nclear the real reason for the reversal was animus towards the program. As Secretary Noem stated,\nshe \"clawed back the full payment that deep state activists unilaterally gave to NYC migrant\nhotels.\" See supra.\n165. \nHamilton's factual assertions are also contradicted by the far-more-specific\nrecollection of Comans that, even after the reimbursement payments were made on February 4,\ne See also NACHA Rule 2.9.1 (allowing ACH reversals to \"correct an Erroneous Entry\npreviously initiated\" and requiring that the \"Originator must make a reasonable attempt to notifu\nthe Receiver of the Reversing Entry and the reason for the Reversing Entry no later than the\nSettlement Date of the Reversing Entry\"); NACHA Rule 2.9.5 (clarifuing that an ACH reversal\nis improper if initiated oofor any reason other than\" to correct an \"erroneous entry\").\n47\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 49 of 84\n2025, FEMA leadership and DOGE discussed and agreed that the Noem Memo applied only to\nnongovemmental  organizations and did not stop payments to state and local government\ngrantees. Comans recalled that there was a policy change made later, some time after February 5,\n2025,to apply the Noem memo to stop payments to state and local govemments and that this\npolicy change lead to the Money Grab. Thus, FEM,{s February 4,2025 wire transfer to the City\nwas not in \"error\" at the time that it was made.\n165. \nThe Hamilton2l2S Declaration repeated the vague assertions about\npossible illegal activity he articulated in the Hamilton 2lll Declaration and in the Remedy of\nooconcern\" \nNoncompliance Letter. He also further elaborated on Defendants purported  that\n\"entities receiving payments might be involved in illegal activity, seemingly speciffing the\n\"Roosevelt Hotel\" as an'NGO\" that may be receiving funds. ECF No. 17-1 flfl 10, 12. But,\nHamilton did not identifu any illegal activity by the hotel itself, only mere speculation that illegal\nactivities might be \"presumed\" to have occurred there. Id. n 6. And none of these vague\nallegations justifu the Money Grab, after FEMA had reviewed the reimbursement request and\napproved and paid the reimbursement.\n167.  While Hamilton claimed that the February 4,2025 payment to the City\nwas an \"error\" because of the pause effectuated by the Noem Memo, that memo cannot form a\nlegitimate basis of authority for the Money Grab or for the suspension of SSP. The Noem Memo\nviolates the APA, the separation of powers doctrine and the Spending Clause. To the extent the\nNoem Memo effectuated an across-the-board \"pause,\" it violates the TRO in New York v. Trump.\nTo the extent it is being interpreted as applying to payments to local governments, as well as\nnon-govemmental organizations, that interpretation was not in effect when the payment to the\nCity was made and therefore cannot form the basis of any claim that the February 4 payment to\n48\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 50 of 84\nthe City was the result of an'oerror.\" To the extent the Noem Memo is premised on the concern\nof possible illegality in providing shelter and services to noncitizen migrants released into the\nUnited States by DHS, it improperly imposes new, grant-negating conditions. And finally,\nnothing set forth in the Noem Memo establishes grounds consistent with the Nacha rules\nconceming reversal of an \"erroneous entry.\"\nK. President Trump Announces Termination of ssP as \"wasteo'and,,scam ,, and\nGloats Over the Money Grab Executed 66Just in Time\"\n168. \nOn March 4,2025, President Trump, delivered an address to Congress in\nwhich he touted, among other things, his Administration's efforts to \"combat inflation\" by\n\"ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.\" President Trump enumerated a long list of so-\ncalled \"appalling waste\" \"including \"$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City,\nreal estate developers done very well.\"l0 He then went on to call \"all of these\" programs he had\nidentifled-including SSP-as \"scams\" that had \"been found out and exposed and swiftly\nterminated.\"\n169. \nDefendant Trump thus made clear that Defendants'intent was to end SSP\nentirely, and not merely to review the City's compliance with applicable terms and conditions,\nsaying \"[w]e found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. And we've taken back the money\nand reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things.\"\n170. \nDef'endant Trump then added: \"Taking back a lot of that money, we got it\njust in fi1ng\"- a seeming reference to the Money Grab, which was completed near close of\nt0 Transcript of President Donald Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress, Associated\nPress, Mar. 5, 2025 10:05 am, https://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-congress-transcript-\n7 5 Ib5 89 I a326 Sffl e5 cI 409 c39 lfefl c.\n49\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 51 of 84\nbusiness on the last day for which an ACH reversal could be effectuated under the ACH rulesl1-\nbefore insisting \"[t]his is just the beginning.\"\nL. Defendants Continued to Represent that the Funds Remain Obligated to the City\n17I. \nOn February 21,2025, the City moved for a temporary restraining order\n(\"TRO\") in this case. Specifically, the City sought a TRO requiring that the funds taken by ACH\nreversal be returned to the City during the pendency of this action.\nI72. \nIn their opposition papers, Defendants sought to reassure the Court that no\nirreparable harm was imminent and no TRO was necessary by representing that \"the funds at\nissue were obligated to\" the City, and that DHS has \"until September 30,2029\" to \"disburse the\nchallenged funds\" to the CiIy. See Mem. of Law in Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Injunction dnd\nTemporary Restraining Order at 11, City of N.Y. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-01510, Dkt. 17 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 28, 2025).

Dkt # 45 (Transcript at\n43).\nM. Defendants Continue to Effectuate the Suspension of SSP\n175. \nOn March I1,2025, Defendants issued letters to noti$ other SSP\nrecipients across the country that, as with the City, their awards were being withheld.l2 For at\nleast some recipients, funds had been zeroed out on USASpending, just as they had been with\nrespect to funds obligated to the City. The letters make no mention of funds being zeroedout of\nUSASpending.\n176. \nThese letters use substantially similar boilerplate language to that found in\nthe Remedy of Noncompliance Letter that FEMA sent the City, stating, without identiffing any\nfacts or basis, that DHS \"has significant concerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged\nin or facilitating illegal activities\" and that DHS is concemed that\nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging\nor inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in\nviolation of law, 8 u.s.c. g 132a(a)(1)(AXiv); transporting or moving illegal\naliens, id. $ 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii);  harboring, concealing, or shielding from\nt2Letter \nfrom FEMA to Pima County, Arizona(Mar. 11,2025),\nf82f8 -efr964 ; Uriel J.\nGarcia, Alejandro Serrano & Berenice Garcia, FEMA wants the names and addresses oJ'\nmigrants helped by Texas nonprofits and local governments that gotfederal grant money, Texas\nTribune, Mar. 13, 2025, https:/hwvw.texastribune.org/2025l03/13/texas-fema-federal-grants-\nimmigrants/; Elliott Wenzler, Trump administration threatens to rescind $32 million promised to\nDenver by FEMAfor migrant shelter costs, Denver Post, Mar. 14,2025,\n/lwww 3/r\nadministration/;  FEMA Withholds SSP Program Payments to Migrant Shelters Pending Review,\nImmigration Policy Tracking Project, Mar. 1I,2025,\nhttps://immpolicytracking.org/policies/fema-announces-review-of-migrant-shelter-aid/#/tab-\npolicv-documents.\n51\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 53 of 84\ndetection illegal aliens, id. $ 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii);  or applicable conspiracy,\naiding or abetting, or attempt liability respecting these statutes.\nSee e.g.https://content.civicplus.com/apilassets/f82fl|5f8-1974-47ab-83e7-ef0964fa56d8'\nI77.  The letters purport to apply \"specific conditions\" to the recipient's SSP\naward and go on to request the same information the Remedy of Noncompliance  Letter sought\nfrom the City, namely \"1.

As\n1T \ndiscussed above, the Hamilt on2ll1 Declaration, submitted hours after the Money Grab,\ndisingenuously  purported to seek leave from the New York v. Trump court to \"withhold\" SSP\nfunds from the City pursuant to grant terms and conditions.\n179.  Hamilton also stated that SSP grants to the states of Colorado and\nWisconsin are being withheld and \"specific conditions\" are being imposed on these grants\nbecause DHS has \"significant concerns that the SSP funding is going to entities engaged in or\nfacilitating illegal activities.\" New Yorkv. Trump,ECF No 166-1 tl'!T30-31.\nN. FEMA Recommends Formally Terminating SSP\n180.  On March 20,2025, Hamilton provided defendant Noem with a\nmemorandum titled \"Decision\" (\"FEMA Decision Memo\"). The FEMA Decision Memo is a\n52\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 54 of 84\nfurther papering of Defendants'efforts to arbitrarily and unlawfully negate Congress's\nappropriation and deny the City SSP funds to which it is entitled.\n. \n181  The FEMA Decision Memo sets forth FEMA s recommendations to DHS\nfollowing its review of FEMA grants pursuant to the Second Noem Memo. The FEMA Decision\nMemo seeks DHS's approval of its recommendations as to which grants should be cleared, or\nsubject to further review, or terminated, and the grounds for each recommendation. Defendant\nNoem signed off on the FEMA Decision memo on March 25,2025, approving FEMA s\nrecommended actions.\n182. \nThe recommendations in the FEMA Decision Memo address two\nquestions: 1. To which grants should (unspecifled) DHS/FEMA'osanctuary  jurisdiction\"\nconditions or restrictions apply; 2. What is the \"risk profile\" of each grant as it pertains to\nimmigration, i.e. whether, in the view of DHSiFEMA, the grants \"do not encourage or induce\nillegal immigration or harboring of illegal aliens or any other unlawful activity.\" FEMA\nDecision Memo at 1-3.\n183.  o'Proposed \nThe memo sets forth a  Sanctuary Jurisdictions Risk\nMethodology.\" Under the proposed methodology, \"sanctuary Jurisdiction\" conditions and\nrestrictions apply to grant programs that either \"go to a designated sanctuary jurisdiction\" or ooare\nnon-disaster grants and have a nexus to immigration activities, law enforcement, or national\nsecurity, or are not limited by statute.\" FEMA Decision Memo at 3.\n184. \nOf the more than 50 grant programs covered by the memo, FEMA\nrecommended terminating just three of them. One of the three is SSP. FEMA Decision Memoo\nTable A at 5.\n53\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 55 of 84\n185.  FEMA recommended, and Defendant Noem approved, terminating SSP on\ngrounds that \"sanctuary Jurisdiction\" restrictions and conditions should apply and because\nFEMA determined that SSP's immigration oorisk profile\" was high.\n186.  Both FEMA determinations that are the stated bases for the proposed\ntermination are groundless. There were no grounds to designate SSP as a high immigration risk\nprofile. SSP funds only those services that are provided to migrants that DHS releases into the\ncommunity, a population for whom Congress and FEMA determined to reimburse a portion of\nthe cost of shelter and services provided. By definition, the migrants served under SSP are not\n\"illegal\" and are not harbored, as they are provided with Congressionally-authorized  shelter and\nservices.\n187.  FEMA s determination to scrap SSP because of oosanctuary jurisdiction\"\nrisk is likewise not warranted. The administration's displeasure with a jurisdiction's so-called\n\"sanctuary\" policies is no basis for terminating a grant that Congress appropriated and that was\npreviously and duly awarded to that jurisdiction. There are no lawful or rational grounds to\nterminate a grarfthat is specifically appropriated by Congress to address migrants simply on\ngrounds that the grant has a \"nexus to immigration.\"\nO.

On April I , 2025,then-Acting Administrator Hamilton sent the City a\no'effective\nletter announcing that FEMA was terminating each of the City's SSP awards, \nimmediately.\" (ooTermination Letter.\") Upon information and belief, on that same date, then-\nActing Administrator Hamilton sent substantively identical letters to most or all other SSP\ngrantees. See Compl . n n3, City of Chilcago, et al. v. United States Department of Homeland\nSecurity, et al.,l:25-cv-054363  (I{.D. Ill May 16,2025). The Termination Letter arrived seven\n54\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 56 of 84\nweeks after the Zero Out took place and six weeks after the Remedy of Noncompliance Letter\nyet does not make reference to either action.\n189. \nWhereas the Remedy for Noncompliance  Letter announced that FEMA\nwithheld funding based on purported concerns about compliance with 8 U.S.C. S I324,the April\n1 Letters provide an entirely different rationale for FEMA s termination decision: that the grants\n'ono longer effectuate [] the program goals or agency priorities\" (quoting 2 C.F.R. g 200.3a0(a)(2)\n(2020)). The Termination Letter asserted that FEMA took this action o'pursuant to the terms and\nconditions of the grant awards,\" which were defined to include the applicable NOFOs and 2\nC.F.R.  200.3a0(a)(2).\n$ \n190. \nThe Termination Letter fuither states that DHS \"consistent with President\nTrump's direction, is focused on advancing the essential mission of enforcing immigration laws\nand securing the border. Consequently, grant programs that support, or have the potential to\nsupport, illegal immigration through funding illegal activities or support for illegal aliens that is\nnot consistent with DHS's enforcement focus do not effecfuate the agency's current priorities.\"\n191. \nFEMA s assertion that its action is pursuant to the terms and the conditions\nof the grant awards is a red herring. Neither the NOFOs nor 2 C.F.R.  200.340 (a)(2) authorize\n$ \nFEMA to terminate the City's SSP awards, let alone every Shelter and Services Program award at\nonce, simply because the agency no longer approves of the Congressionally-appropriated\nprogram.\nlg2. \nThe NOFOs do not permit FEMA to terminate SSP grants based on\nchanged'oprogram goals or agency priorities.\" Rather, the NOFOs for the grants identiff only\nthree permissible reasons for termination: ( I ) noncompliance;  (2) on consent of the recipient; or\n(3) upon written notice from the recipient.\n55\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 57 of 84\n193.  Nor does 2 C.F.R. $ 200.340(a)(2) permit FEMAto terminate SSP grants\nbased on changed \"program goals or agency priorities\" in the manner that Defendants are\ninterpreting and deploying that phrase. That provision authorizes termination \"pursuant to the\nterms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award\nno longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.\" Defendants did not terminate SSP\nbecause the awards no longer effectuate the goals of SSP but because Defendants oppose SSP\nentirely and do not wish to fund it. 2 C.F.R. $ 200.340(a)(2) does not authorize Defendants to\nsimply change their minds about SSP itself and override the Congressional appropriation that\ncreated it.\nlg4.  Federal regulations require agencies to \"make recipients aware, in a clear\nand unambiguous manner\" of the \"applicable termination provisions in the Federal awarding\nagency's regulations or in each Federal award.\" 2 C.F.R. $ 200.21l(cXlXv); see also id. $\n200.340(b) (agencies \"must clearly and unambiguously  specifr all termination provisions\napplicable to each Federal award, in applicable regulations or in the award, consistent with this\nsection\"). Nothing in either the Notices of Funding Opportunity or the applicable regulations\ncontemplates a wholesale shutdown of every grant award at once.\nlg5.  Moreover, 2 C.F.R.  200.340(a)(2) does not permit termination for the\n$ \nreason provided in the Termination Letter for at least three independent reasons.\n196.  First, agencies may terminate grants under section 200.340(a)(2) only\nwhen the ground for termination is \"authorized by law\" and is actually included as a term and\ncondition of the federal award. 2 C.F.R. $ 200.340( a)(4); see Metro. Transp. Auth. V Duffy,2025\nU.S. Distr. LEXIS 101448,*60 (S.D.N.Y. May 28,2025)(citing Climate United Fundv.\nCitibank, N.A.,2025 WL 1131412, at 16 (D.D.C. Apr. 16,2025). In enacting SSP to reimburse\n56\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 58 of 84\nnon-federal entities for the cost of caring for migrants released by DHS, Congress did not\nauthorize FEMA to terminate grants, individually or en masse, based on FEMA's disagreement\nwith the Program's purpose.\nIg7. \nSecond, in amending section 200.3401o add subsection (a)(2),the U.S.\nOffice of Management and Budget made clear that the amendment may not be used in the\nmanner that Defendants invoke it here: to simply negate grant programs over changes in policy.\nOMB specifically addressed concerns that \"the proposed language will provide Federal agencies\ntoo much leverage to arbitrarily terminate awards without sufficient cause\" by emphasizing that\n\"agencies are not able to terminate grants arbitrarily.\" Guidance for Grants and Agreements, 85\nFed. Reg. 49506 (Aug. 13,2020). The Office explained:\nThe intent of this change is to ensure that Federal awarding agencies prioritize\nongoing support to Federal awards that meet program goals. For instance,\nfollowing the issuance of a Federal award, if additional evidence reveals that a\nspecific award objective is ineffective at achieving program goals, it may be in the\ngovemment's interest to terminate the Federal award.\nrd.\n198. \nThis explanation makes clear that an agency cannot terminate a grant\nbased on mid-grant changes in the agency's own goals.Rather, section 200.340(a)(2) permits\nterminations  only if the grantee is ineffective in advancing the progran 3 original goals. The\nApril I Letter does not argue that the City has been ineffective in providing shelter and services\nconsistent with SSP, only that SSP itself no longer aligns with Defendants' priorities.\ni[/g. \nThird, even if section200.340(a)(2) allowed FEMA to terminate individual\ngrants bqsed on changes in FEMA's own goals, FEMA failed to offer a reasonable explanation\nwhy terminating SSP entirely will further FEMAs stated goals. The April I Letters did not\nexplain how coordinating  with DHS to provide shelter and services to migrants processed by\nDHS and released from DHS custody is inconsistent with o'enforcing immigration laws\" or\n57\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 59 of 84\n'osecuring the border,\" particularly since it was DHS itself that released the migrants served by\nSSP into the country. Nor did the agency demonstrate that it had given appropriate consideration\nto the reliance interests of grantees such as the City.\n200.  The Termination Letter's assertion that migrants receiving services under\nthe Shelter and Services Program \"often have no legal status and are in the United States\nunlawfully ... this, in turn, provides support for illegal aliens and is not consistent with DHS's\ncurrent priorities\" contradicts the Termination Letter's acknowledgement that SSP limits funding\nto entities that provide services to migrants ooreleased from DHS short-term holding facilities\"-\ni.e., migrants whose status is known to DHS and who DHS determined should be released into\nthe U.S. As noted above, FEMA approved reimbursement payments only after reviewing the A\nNumbers of people served by the City for whom reimbursement was sought.\n201.  In fact, the Termination Letter acknowledges that the City \"carr[ied] out\nthe purposes of the SSP identified in the awards'respective fNotices of Funding Opportunity]\"\nby \"provid[ing] shelter, food, transportation, acute medical care and personal hygiene supplies\nfor individuals released from DHS short-term holding facilities.\" FEMA's shifting explanation\nstrongly suggest that FEMA s termination stems solely from a policy tumabout unrelated to the\nCity's performance, which at all times was consistent with the policies and purposes for which\nthe grants were made\nP. The Termination Letter Sets Up a Sham Closeout Process\n202.  The Termination Letter requires that the City \"complete all closeout\nprocedures\" by submitting specified information within 120 days. FEMA will then \"determine\nthe final allowable costs for your awards\" by ooevaluating whether all submitted costs incurred\nbefore fRemedy for Noncompliance Letter] are necessary, allocable, and reasonable.\" If \"FEMA\n58\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 60 of 84\ndetermines that the total allowable costs exceed the amount paid to date, then FEMA will make a\nfinal payment for that difference.\" If FEMA determines that oothe payments made exceed the\nfinal allowable costs,\" however, then FEMA will require that the City \"promptly refund the\ndifference.\" In other words, FEMA intends to re-review payments that the agency already made\nand-if FEMA determines that it should not have made those payments-require the City to\nreturn the money.\n203. \nThe closeout procedures described in the Termination Letter are\nmisleading insofar as they hold open the possibility that FFMA will pay grantees. The Zero Out\nand Defendants' statements about SSP, described above, make clear Defendants' intent to not\npay the City absent a court order requiring Defendants to do so (i.e., not in connection with a\ncloseout).\n204. \nGrantees and subrecipients nevertheless must complete the closeout\nprocedures described in the April I Letters. See 2 C.F.R. $ 200.344(b) ('A recipient must submit\nall reports ... no later than I20 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance.\nA subrecipient must submit all reports ... to the pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar\ndays after the conclusion of the period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as\nagreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient).\").\n205. \nBut this is not a normal close-out process, and, here too, Defendants are\nsimply using the close-out process to put a legal gloss on their extralegal actions. Plaintiffs'\nShelter and Services Program grants-and on information and belief all other Shelter and\nServices Program grants-are no longer visible in the FEMA portal that grantees would typically\nuse to submit closeout information. Nor has FEMA acted on the draw-down requests that\nPlaintiffs submitted via that system, which, again,are no longer visible in the FEMA portal.\n59\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 61 of 84\n206.  Instead, on April 24,2025,the City-and on information and belief all\nother Shelter and Services Program grantees-received closeout instructions from an unsigned\nFEMA email account. The instructions require Plaintiffs to submit their final closeout\ndocumentation via email.\n207.  The documentation that FEMA requires includes a \"Final Financial\nReport\" using a standard form that is typically used to calculate the final amount of allowable\ncosts incurred. But the April24 instructions a/so require grantees to concurrently submit a \"final\nrequest for payment.\" This makes it impossible to know what the final amount of allowable costs\nwill be because FEMA will not have issued a determination  on the final payment requests at the\ntime the Final Financial Report is due. Moreover, because the Remedy for Noncompliance  Letter\nwithheld funding based on \"potential noncompliance,\" but did not state whether FEMA will find\nactual noncompliance, it is unclear whether the City may submit final payment requests or may\ncertifi that their costs are allowable.\n208.  Moreover, even if the City were to submit all required documentation as\ndirected by the Apil24 instructions, there is no reason to believe that it will receive any further\npayments, because the funds that should be available to pay reimbursement requests have all\nbeen zeroed out in FEMA's financial system.\n209.  Tellingly, the April24 instructions do not provide a timeline for when\nFEMA will decide whether any \"final request for payment\" will be processed or paid out; the\nemail simply states that once grantees have submitted their close-out documentation, \"You will\nbe notified when the award is closed.\" And once an award is closed, the likelihood of future\npayment grows even more remote. Once again, Defendants have dangled the possibility of future\n60\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 62 of 84\npayment in fronl of grantees but otherwise acted as though SSP has been eliminated and funds\nrendered unavailable.\nQ. Defendants Play Hide-the-Balt With the City's SSP Funds\n2I0. \nAs noted above, even after the Money Grab, FEMA GO (FEMA's grant\nadministration  platform) was continuing to show that the funds awarded to the city remained\nobligated and available to the City. However, following the April 1, termination, Defendants\nremoved the City's access to FEMA GO with respect to SSP. City staff could no longer access\nFEMA GO and observe the status of SSP funds.\n2ll. \nThus, following the April I Termination Letter, USASpending.gov was\nthe only source of visibility into the availability of SSP fiqd, awarded to the City. Given that,\nand that the Zero Out seemed inconsistent with various statements that FEMA was merely\ntemporarily withholding the funds and that the funds remained obligated to the City, the City\nsought clarification as to the status of the sSP funds awarded to the city.\n212. \nOn April 24,2025,counsel for the City wrote to counsel for defendants by\nemail and asked:\n[G]iven that the City no longer has access to FEMA Go, would\nyou advise as to the status of the $80 million that was transferred\nto the City on February 4 and then subject to an ACH reversal on\nFebruary 11? Do the funds remain obligated in an expired account\nper GOA Redbook 5-67,5-72 and available pending the outcome\nof this litigation until September 30, 2029? We note that the funds\nas shown on usaspending.gov appear to have been zeroed out by\n\"revision\" on February 12,2025, even though FEMA GO showed\nthe funds as approved for payment for some time\nthereafter. Please advise.\n2I3. \nOn May 23,2025, counsel for Defendants wrote back and related to us:\nIn short, the funds remain available to make any payments that\nmight be required by the court. When FEMA terminated these\nawards, it deobligated all of the funds in FEMAs financial\n6I\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 63 of 84\nmanagement system to make sure that no drawdown of the\ndisputed funds could occur. When it did that, this caused\nUSASpending to show the obligations as $0. However, 31 U.S.C.\nl50l (the Recording Statute) requires FEMA and DHS to record\nobligations, which it did for the original grant amount. Although\nwe have a dispute regarding your claim, until it is resolved, FEMA\nis still required to maintain - and has maintained -- a recorded\nobligation for the maximum amount of the claim under the\ngrant. Consequently, pending resolution of the dispute, these funds\nremain obligated in the amount of $80,481,861.42.\n214.  To the extent the message provided by counsel is an accurate statement of\nDefendants' position as to the status of the funds, that position is problematic and appears\ncontrary to fact for several reasons. First, it suggests that the funds were zeroed out of\nusaspending.gov because the grant awards were \"terminated\" and the funds \"deobligated.\" But\nthe funds were zeroed out by February 12,2025,whi1e the grants were not terminated until April\n1,2025.\n2I5. \nSecond, to the extent the grant was terminated and the funds \"de-\nobligated\" as of Febru ary 12,2025,that is inconsistent with numerous statements made by\nFEMA that the funds were merely being temporarily withheld. These include statements by\nthen-Director Cameron on February 11, 2025,the February 18,2025 Remedy of Noncompliance\nLetter to the City, the March 11,2025 noncompliance  letters to other jurisdictions. It is also\ninconsistent with the position Defendants took in this litigation that SSP funds remain obligated\nto the City through September 2029.\n216. \nThird, the statement that the funds remain available to satisff a court order\ndirecting payment is inconsistent with FEMA s statement in the Termination Letter that FEMA\nwould make any payment to the City warranted by completion of the Closeout process. If the\n62\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 64 of 84\nfunds are \"deobligated,\" they are presumably not available in the event the City is owed money\npursuant to the closeout.\n217. \nDefendants' position is also confusing and internally contradictory, as it\nboth asserts that FEMA \"deobligated\" the funds and also that those funds remain \"obligated\" to\nthe city in the full amount of any claim the city may have under its grants.\nR. DHS Further lhreatens SSP Through a Vastly-Overreaching Investigation\n2I8. \nEven after terminating SSP, Defendants have continued setting up pretexts\nto deny the City SSP funds that were awarded the City, including funds FEMA approved for\nreimbursement.\n2Ig. \nJoseph N. Mazzara, Acting General Counsel for defendant DHS, sent City\nOMB a letter dated June 4, 2025 announcing a \"Notice of Investigation and Demand for\nRecords: Shelter and Services Program Grant Awards\" (\"Notice of Investigation\"). Under the\nguise of investigating the City's expenditure of SSP funds, the Notice of Investigation sets forth a\nseries of document demands and \"interrogatories\" that reach far beyond the scope of anything\nrelated to the City's expenditures of federal SSP funds.\n220. \nAs with the Remedy of Noncompliance  Letter, the Notice of Investigation\ncites \"concerns that entities receiving payment under your grant may be guilty of'violating\nvarious provisions of 8 U.S.C. S 1324 prohibiting'oencouraging or iirducing an alien to come to,\nenter, or reside in the United States in violation of law, . . . transporting or moving illegal aliens, \n.\n. . harboring, concealing, or shielding from detection illegal aliens, . . . or violating applicable\nconspiracy aiding or abetting, or attempt provisions\" of the statute.\n221. \nAs DHS is aware, when FEMA reviewed and approved reimbursement,\nFEMA determined that all funds paid to the City were to reimburse for expenditures on\n63\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 65 of 84\nimmigrants with valid ANumbers that FEMA verified and matched as belonging to an\nimmigrant that DHS encountered and released into the community.\n222.  The scope of the demand far exceeds anything related to the administration\nof SSP. For example, the demand seeks, without apparent limitation or connection to immigrants\nserved under SSP:\no  o'All documents related to Your compliance with 8 U.S.C. g 1324.\"\no \"All documents related to any instructions, guidance, suggestions, or\nrecommendations for aliens to consider\" in completing immigration or other\ngovernment forms or interacting with any federal or state government\nofficials.\"\na \"All documents related to Your cooperation with law enforcement (including\nimmigration officials) concerning aliens whom You have encountered'\"\no \"All documents related to instructions, guidanse, or recommendations, made\navailable to aliens, regarding how to interact with law enforcement.\"\na A list of all'ocategories of information You have collected about any aliens.\"\n223.  Despite the exceedingly broad scope of the demands, the Notice of\nInvestigation provides just 30 days within which OMB \"must produce\" the records and\ninformation sought.\n224. \nThe broad and invasive scope of these and other demands makes clear that\nthe Notice of Investigation is aimed at establishing additional grounds improperly to deny the\nCity funds to which it is entitled under SSP. The Notice of Investigation puts funds at risk for not\ncomplying (in full and to DHS's satisfaction) with demands that are unrelated to the\nadministration of SSP.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCount I\nSubstantive APA Violation: Illegal Money Grab\n64\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 66 of 84\nArbitrary and Capriciousl Abuses of Discretion\n(Against Agency Defendants)\n225. \nthe City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth\nherein.\n226. \nDefendants include \"agenc[ies]\" under the APA. 5 U.S.C. $ 551(l).\n227. \nThe Money Grab is agency action subject to review under the APA.\n228. \nThe APA requires that a court \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action,\nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary,capricious,  an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. $ 706(2)(4).\n229.

It is not\na lawful rescission because lawful rescissions are subject to congressional approval, and the\nPresident has not sought congressional approval.

But at the time of their filing, FEMA had already grabbed the\n$80 million from New York City without providing notice, without requesting any information,\nwithout announcing any findings, and without following any required process.\n74\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 76 of 84\n284. \nDefendants'February 18,2025 Remedy of Noncompliance  Letter did not\nidentifu any noncompliance by the City. Indeed, FEMA issued the letter, purporting to impose on\nthe City \"specific conditions\" and withholding of funding, before conducting a compliance\nreview and then appeared to collapse multiple steps in the administrative  process. It carried out\nthis misuse of administrative  procedures without giving the City the opportunity to object and\npresent its own information before implementing the specific conditions, the pause or suspension\nof SSP and the withholding of tunds. 2 cFR 200.305(b)(6),  200.305(bX7), 200.342.\n285. \nMoreover FEMA's \"concems\" are facially pretextual and unsupported.\nThe Remedy of Noncompliance Letter requests information that is not related to the asserted\nconcerns and seeks information that, for the most part, has already been provided by the City,\nreviewed by FEMA, and determined to be sufficient for payment. This pretextual Remedy of\nNoncompliance  Letter does not provide the City with the procedural protections to which it is\nentitled.\n286. \nFurtheg the letter creates the impression of a City-specific compliance\nreview when, in fact, Defendants have determined to suspend or pause SSP due to antipathy\ntowards the program itself and with the intent to terminate SSP for that reason, whether as to the\nCity or program-wide.\n287. \nIn effectuating the Zerc Out, Defendants failed to follow the procedures\navailable under the SSP GrantAward Letters, the NOFOs and the Code of Federal Regulations,\nincorporated into the grant documents. Indeed, Defendants gave no notice and do not appear to\nhave followed any procedure at all.\n288. \nIn issuing the Termination Letter, Defendants failed to follow the\nprocedures available under the SSP Grant Award Letters, the NOFOs and the Code of Federal\n75\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 77 of 84\nRegulations, incorporated into the grant documents because those procedures do not allow for\ntermination of SSP for the reasons given by Defendants.\n289. \nNone of these actions require the City to exhaust administrative remedies\nbefore seeking judicial relief.\n2g0.

In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to additional appropriate relief under 5\nU.S.C. $ 705 ordering Defendants to reverse the Money Grab by returning the $80 million to the\nCity's bank account and to reverse the Zero Out, and enjoining Defendants from pausing or\nsuspending SSP and implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds, and from\nimplementing the Termination Leffer and terminating the City's SSP awards.\nCount VI\nViolation of Due Process\n(Against All Defendants)\n292.  The City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth\nherein.\n293.  Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution, the government may not deprive a person or entity of a protected property\ninterest without due process of law\n294.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief \"with\nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.\" Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr,\nlnc.,575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015).\n76\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 78 of 84\n295. \nthe City has a protected property interest in the $80 million that\nDefendants grabbed back from the City's bank account and zeroed out on USASpending.gov,\nand in the SSP23 funds it has been awarded and which have been disbursed to the City.\n296,. \nThe City has a protected property interest in the funds - $36 million - that\nwere awarded and obligated to the City under SSP pending disbursement upon an approved\nclaim but that Defendants zeroed out on USASpending.gov.\n2g7. \nDefendants' conduct in implementing the Money Grab deprived the City\nof its property interest without providing notice or a pre-deprivation opportunity to be heard.\n298. \nWhile a post-deprivation opportunity to be heard would not be sufficient\nunder the circumstances, Defendants have not in fact provided a genuine post-deprivation\nopportunity to be heard because the process being offered is pretextual and illusory. For example,\nby the time Defendants issued the Remedy for Noncompliance Letter, the Zero Out had already\nbeen effectuated. Also, while the Remedy for Noncompliance Letter requests more information,\nthat information is largely identical to the information that FEMA already reviewed and\napproved in connection with approving disbursements  to the City for the SSP24 and SSP23\ngrants. Additionally, the information requested does not speak to the purported \"concerns\"\narticulated in the letter. As is clear from Defendants' statements and actions, they have \",\ndetermined to suspend and terminate SSP and not make SSP payments and are using the\nnoncompliance letter (and similar letters to other grant recipients) to accomplish that aim.\n299. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C . 5 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the\nMoney Grab, the pausing or suspending of SSP, and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23\nfunding, the Zero Out, and the Termination Letter and termination of SSP are contrary to law.\n77\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 51     Filed 06/16/25     Page 79 of 84\n300. \nIn addition, Plaintiffis entitled to additional appropriate relief including\n(1) ordering Defendants to reverse the Money Grab by returning the $80 million to the City's\nbank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City bank\naccount in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 grants; (3) ordering Defendants to reverse the\nZerc Out; and (a) enjoining Defendants from suspending or pausing SSP or implementing the\nwithholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds and from implementing the Termination Letter and\nterminating SSP.\nCount VII\nSeparation of Powers\n(Against All Defendants)\n301.  The City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth\nherein.\n302. \nArticle I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution enumerates that:\n\"[a]11 legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which\nshall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\" U.S. Const.

Moreover, FEMA awarded and paid the funds in accordance \nwith Congressional authorization, whose purpose was to allow DHS to reduce crowding in its \ndetention facilities by providing ﬁnancial support to border communities that provided services \nto migrants, including cities in Texas and Arizona, and other locales that experienced large \ninﬂuxes of migrants, including the City.  In sum, without any authority, Defendants deprived the \nCity of funds to which it was in every respect entitled. \n�is money grab was a lawless agency action that failed to comply in any respect with the \nprocedural and substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706. It \nis the very deﬁnition of government action that is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nand contrary to law. Defendants acted in excess of any plausible statutory authority and indeed in \nviolation of due process, the separation of powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. �ey acted \nas if they were not governmental actors at all.   \nA preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order are thus essential—and amply \nwarranted—to direct Defendants to return the money and to prevent them taking the same lawless \naction again.  �e grab-back is causing the City immediate and irreparable harm, in the loss of \nover $80 million in funds appropriated by Congress and approved for the City’s use by FEMA. \nIf the funds are not promptly restored to the City, they may well be unrecoverable at all because \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 7 of 29\nthey cannot be recovered in an action for compensatory money damages and the appropriated \nfunds—the only source for recovery—may be exhausted, rescinded, or lapse before this action is \ndetermined. �e balance of the equities weighs overwhelmingly in Plaintiﬀ’s favor:  the City has \na clear and substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claims, and, without a mandatory \npreliminary injunction requiring the return of the money, it faces the prospect of having no \navailable mechanism to recoup the funds. In the event Defendants are successful in their defense \nof this action, on the other hand, they will be able to recover the funds from the City.  \nAn injunction also serves the public interest. Congress speciﬁcally appropriated funds to \nFEMA to relieve overcrowding at the border and this is exactly what the FEMA funds provided \nto the City were intended to do; they enabled the City to provide shelter and services to migrants \nreleased by DHS, who made their way to the City. �ese grant funds were also paid after FEMA \nhad approved the City’s intended use of the funds and the actual documented expenditures. While \nthe City is acting in the public interest, Defendants most deﬁnitively are not—in grabbing back \nthese allocated and approved funds, they are intentionally thwarting Congress’s intent. \nPlaintiﬀ thus respectfully requests that this Court schedule a hearing on this matter as soon \nas counsel may be heard and that pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, grant the City \na preliminary injunction pending the determination of the merits of this action and for the issuance \nof a temporary restraining order pending the hearing on the motion, ordering Defendants to \nreverse their removal of over $80 million from the City’s bank account and enjoining Defendants \nfrom taking any further grant money from the City’s bank account.  \nFACTS \n�e relevant facts are set forth in the accompanying Declaration of Jacques Jiha, Director \nof the New York City Oﬃce of Management and Budget (“City OMB”), dated Feb. 21, 2025 \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 8 of 29\n(“Jiha Decl.”) and Declaration of Joshua Rubin, dated Feb. 20, 2025 (“Rubin Decl.”) and are \nsummarized below.  \nA.  Congressional Authorization for SSP Funding \nIn 2023, Congress authorized FEMA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) \nto establish SSP. Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-\n328, Title II, 136 Stat. 4730 (2022). Congress authorized continued funding for the program in \n2024 of $650,000,000 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act (the \n“DHS Appropriations Act”). DHS Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 598 (2024) \n�e stated purpose of SSP is “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal \nentities, in support of relieving overcrowding in short-term holding facilities of U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection.” Id. To that end, the program reimburses non-federal entities providing shelter \nand related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from DHS. Id. \nB.  The City’s Awarded SSP Grants \nOn June 12, 2023, FEMA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”) for SSP \nfunding for Fiscal Year 2023 (the “SSP23 NOFO”). Jiha Decl. ¶ 6. FEMA awarded the City $106.9 \nmillion under this grant and to date, the City has received $70.6 million in reimbursement from \nFEMA under this grant and may seek $36.3 million more. Id. ¶ 18; see also id., Exs. 4 (FY23 SSP \nAward Letter) & 5 (FY23 SSP Award Letter Amendment). \nOn April 12, 2024, FEMA issued two NOFOs for localities to apply for SSP funding for \nFiscal Year 2024, an an allocation grant (the “SSP-A NOFO”) and a competitive grant (the “SSP-\nC NOFO”). See id. ¶ 8.  FEMA awarded the City a total of $ 81,471,963.07.  For the SSP-A grant, \nthe City was awarded $59,302,125.07 and for the SSP-C grant, the City was awarded $22,269,838. \nId. ¶¶ 29-30; see also id., Exs. 10 (SSP-A Award Notice) & Ex. 13 (SSP-C Award Notice). On \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 9 of 29\nFebruary 4, 2025, the City received payments under both grants for a total of approximately $80.4 \nmillion,  leaving  approximately  $1  million  from  which  the  City  may  seek  additional \nreimbursements. Id. ¶ 38. \nC.  Information Provided to FEMA by the City \nIn connection with its SSP grant applications, the City through its Oﬃce of Management \nand Budget (“OMB”) submitted documentation including a budget specifying the costs for which \nthe City would seek reimbursement under the grants.  �ese costs encompassed lodging, meals, \nmedical costs, case coordination, and security. Id. ¶¶ 18, 20-26.  �e City speciﬁed the rate of \nreimbursement sought for each cost, including $62.19 per person per night for lodging at hotels \nunder the SSP24 grant. Id. ¶ 25. �e City also speciﬁed the number of noncitizen migrants it \nanticipated serving and identiﬁed each hotel, motel, and facility that the City intended to use, \nincluding a location called the Roosevelt Hotel. Id. ¶ 26. FEMA approved the budget.   \nIn September 2024 FEMA conducted a joint ﬁnancial and programming site visit.  Jiha \nDecl. ¶ 21-22.  As part of the visit, oﬃcials from FEMA and the CBP toured the Roosevelt Hotel \nand another facility. FEMA oﬃcials also visited the Roosevelt Hotel on September 26, 2024.  Id.  \n�e site visits did not produce any objection to the City’s use of the hotel.  Id.   \nIn requesting reimbursement under the SSP grants, City OMB provided FEMA with even \nmore documentation, including a detailed cost summary, proof of expenditures including invoices \nand proofs of payment, and the names, A-Numbers, and DHS release dates for the individuals for \nwhom the City provided shelter and services. Id. ¶ 15, 35  \nFEMA’s decision to award funding to the City and its subsequent payments—made \nfollowing its review of the City’s detailed submissions—constituted a determination that the costs, \nthe City incurred in providing shelter and services to noncitizen migrants released by DHS were \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 10 of 29\nindeed eligible for reimbursement.  \nD.  Defendants’ Money Grab \nOn Wednesday, February 12, 2025, City OMB learned from the City’s Department of \nFinance that at 4:03 pm on February 11, 2025, $80,481,861.42 had been removed from the City’s \ncentral treasury account where the SSP funds had been deposited on February 4, 2025. Id. ¶ 41. \n�e amount removed constitutes the entire amount that FEMA had approved for reimbursement \nand disbursed to the City for the SSP-A and SSP-C grants combined. Id. ¶ 42. Prior to removing \nthe funds, FEMA did not follow any of the requirements in the NOFOs or the regulations set forth \nin 2 C.F.R 200.100 et seq., which are incorporated into the grant documents by reference. See Jiha \nDecl. Ex. 2 (SSP-A NOFO) at 50; id., Ex. 3 (SSP-C NOFO) at 45. �ose requirements not only \ninclude providing notice but an opportunity to object. See e.g. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.208 (d); 200.342. \nE.  Defendants’ Statements About the Money Grab  \nOutside  the  grant  administration  process,  however,  Elon  Musk  (“Musk”),  who  is \npurportedly  leading the Department of Government Eﬃciency  (“DOGE”),  Defendant Kristi \nNoem, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and Defendant Cameron Hamilton, \nthe Senior Oﬃcial Performing the Duties of the FEMA Administrator (“Administrator Hamilton”), \nmade public statements opposing the SSP and touting the money grab.  \nOn February 10, 2025, both Musk and Administrator Hamilton posted messages on the \nsocial media platform “X” stating that there would be a “clawback demand” for the City’s SSP \nfunds because the funds were used to provide shelter for “illegal migrants” at “high end hotels” \n“in violat[ion] of the law.” Rubin Decl. ¶¶ 6-7. All of these assertions were unsupported. As noted \nabove, supra Parts A-D, the City’s SSP funds were used to shelter non-citizen migrants released \ninto the community by DHS. FEMA had approved the per diem rates in advance of the City seeking \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 11 of 29\nreimbursement. And FEMA awarded the money to the City in accordance with the authority given \nto it by Congress to provide funds to “non-federal” entities as part of SSP.  \nAdministrator Hamilton acknowledged as much in a subsequent “X” post, stating that \n“Congress should never have passed bills asking FEMA to do this work. �is stops now.” Id. ¶ 8. \nBut he oﬀered no basis on which FEMA could refuse to abide by Congress’s legislation creating \nthe grant program and appropriating funds for it—let alone on what basis FEMA could simply \ngrab funds out of the City’s bank account, without any process or ﬁndings, where FEMA had \npreviously paid those amounts to the City after it reviewed and approved the City’s expenditures \nfor reimbursement. \nF.  FEMA “Pause[s]” SSP without Lawful Basis, but Claims in Federal Court Filings to \nBe Following “Applicable” Laws and Procedures  \n \nDefendants openly articulated their hostility to SSP, their unwillingness to administer the \nprogram, and their intention to take back the SSP funding. However, Defendants are subject to a \ntemporary  restraining  order  ordering  them  not  to  “pause,  freeze,  impede,  block,  cancel,  or \nterminate  Defendants’  compliance  with  awards  and  obligations  to  provide  federal  ﬁnancial \nassistance …except on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms” and \nto  “comply  with  all  notice  and  procedural  requirements  in  the  award,  agreement,  or  other \ninstrument relating to decisions to stop, delay, or otherwise withhold federal ﬁnancial assistance \nprograms.” New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39-JJM-PAS, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17593 (D.R.I. Jan. \n31, 2025) , ECF No. 50 (the “TRO”). �at TRO was entered in a case ﬁled by 22 states (including \nNew York) seeking to temporarily restrain and enjoin the across-the-board pause on federal \nfunding disbursement implemented by the Trump administration. See generally New York v. \nTrump, No. 25-cv-39-JJM-PAS (D.R.I. ﬁled Jan. 28, 2025) (hereinafter “New York v. Trump”).  \nOn the evening of February 11, 2025, just hours after the money grab, several Defendants \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 12 of 29\nhere ﬁled an “Emergency Motion . . . for Permission to Continue Withholding FEMA and Other \nFunding” in New York v. Trump,. See Rubin Decl., Ex. C (“Emergency Mot.”). �e emergency \nmotion purported to seek conﬁrmation that a “withholding” of FEMA funding to the City did not \nviolate the TRO.  Without mentioning that FEMA had already taken SSP funds from the City, the \nemergency motion stated that “FEMA seeks to withhold Shelter and Services Program (SSP) \nfunding based on concerns regarding the program” and “respectfully requests conﬁrmation that \nDefendants may permissibly withhold certain FEMA funding, i.e., as ‘a speciﬁc instance where \nthey are acting in compliance with this Order but otherwise withholding funds due to speciﬁc \nauthority.’” Rubin Decl., Ex. C  at 2-3 (emphasis added).  \nIn his accompanying declaration, Administrator Hamilton omitted any mention of the \nmoney-grab and stated that the SSP funds were being “paused” because Defendants believed—\nbased on media reports from October and November 2024 describing alleged illegal acts by people \nstaying at hotels, in particular the Roosevelt Hotel—that the funds were being used for “illegal” \nactivity. Declaration of Cameron Hamilton (“Hamilton Decl.”) ¶ 11, New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-\ncv-00039 (D.R.I. Feb. 11, 2025), ECF No. 102-1. �e Hamilton Declaration did not disclose that \nFEMA oﬃcials twice visited that the Roosevelt in September 2024 nor that the media articles cited \nin the declaration pre-dated FEMA’s approval of the City’s SSP grants. �e Hamilton Declaration \ndid not identify any activity by the City that was inconsistent with the terms of the SSP or unlawful, \nexcept for vague allegations of encouraging aliens to reside in the U.S., transporting illegal aliens, \nharboring, or aiding and abetting. Id. ¶ 10.  Since all the migrants for whom FEMA reimbursed the \nCity were released into the community by DHS with an A-number and the reimbursement was for \nthe express purpose of relieving DHS of the burden of maintaining these individuals in DHS \ncustody, these assertions are without merit.   \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 13 of 29\n�e Hamilton Declaration also cited news articles concerning misuses of funds by non-\ngovernmental organizations (“NGOs”), id. ¶ 10, and attached a January 28, 2025 Memorandum \nfor Component and Oﬃce Heads from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem concerning funding for NGOs \nand directing that “all Department grant disbursements . . . that . . . touch in any way on \nimmigration, are on hold pending review,” including “the Shelter and Services Program, and any \nsimilar program.” Rubin Decl., Ex. E. None of the material cited reported misuse of funds by the \nCity.  \nThe day after the filing of the Emergency Motion, on February 12, 2025, at 1:37 pm, \nDefendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem repeated the statements in the Hamilton Declaration, that \npersons residing in hotels the City used to temporarily shelter non-citizen migrants committed \ncrimes and that approved SSP funds were grabbed back from “NYC migrant hotels.” Rubin Decl. \n¶ 16.  \nG. �e “Noncompliance” Letter \nMore than a week after the money grab, Defendants began to manufacture a veneer of \nthe procedural compliance that Administrator Hamilton had represented in court ﬁlings they were \nfollowing. On February 19, 2025, City OMB, received a letter, dated February 18, 2025, from \nFEMA Administrator Hamilton with the subject-line “Remedy for Noncompliance Letter, Shelter \nand Services Program (SSP).” Jiha Decl., Ex. 20. �e letter referenced both the SSP23 and the \nSSP24 grants, appearing to indicate that it was about SSP grants the City received for both years.  \nIn  the  letter, Administrator  Hamilton  purports  to  “notify  [City  OMB]  that  DHS/FEMA  is \ntemporarily withholding payments to [City OMB].” Id. at 1. �e letter admits that FEMA grabbed \nback the SSP24 grant awards paid to the City, stating that FEMA “recovered two payments \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 14 of 29\ncompleted via direct deposit on February 4, 2025, totaling $80,481,861.42.” Id. �e letter claims \nthat the money grab “constitutes a part of this temporary withholding.” Id.  \n�e letter states that DHS “has signiﬁcant concerns that SSP funding is going to \nentities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities.” Id. But it does not allege any purported illegal \nactivities committed by any entity that might have been paid with funds for which the City \nobtained reimbursement. Instead, the letter alleges—citing and exaggerating the same media \nreports that defendant Hamilton cited in his declaration a week earlier—“[f]or example, a \nsubstantial portion of your award goes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New \nYork City.” Id. \n�e “noncompliance” letter goes on to allege: \nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has \ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of operations \nto plan a variety of crimes.1 According to these same reports, these crimes \ninclude gun and drug sales as well as sex trafficking, which can reasonably be \npresumed to be conducted in the hotel itself. \nId.  \n�e letter also expresses “concern” that  \nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging or \ninducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in violation of \nlaw, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv); transporting or moving illegal aliens, id. § \n1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); harboring, concealing, or shielding from detection illegal \naliens, id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii); or applicable conspiracy, aiding or abetting, or \nattempt liability respecting these statutes. \nId. Defendants have not oﬀered any other basis for the money-grab.  \nH. Harm to the City \n�e over $80 million grabbed back by Defendants is reimbursement for amounts that the \nCity already expended in reliance on the SSP’s terms, and that FEMA awarded, reviewed in detail, \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 15 of 29\napproved for payment, and paid to the City. Because of Defendants’ money grab, the City is at risk \nof losing this funding permanently even if it prevails in this lawsuit.  SSP funds could become \nunavailable to the City during the time it takes to decide this lawsuit, if the SSP appropriation is \nfully obligated (i.e. the City’s funds are redistributed to other recipients) and thus exhausted; the \nappropriation expires; or if the appropriation is rescinded by Congress. Defendants have articulated \ntheir hostility to SSP and their desire to stop disbursing SSP funds, even if disbursement is \nconsistent with Congressional purpose. �e City, even if ultimately successful here, risks a \npermanent loss of these funds because of Defendants’ $80 million money grab.  In addition, given \nthat the noncompliance letter references the SSP23 grant funds for which the City was previously \nreimbursed, Defendants may attempt to unlawfully execute another money grab for the SSP23 \nfunds.  Hence the City seeks an injunction to require the repayment of the $80 million in SSP24 \nfunds and an injunction to prevent Defendants from another money grab of the SSP23 funds.    \nARGUMENT \nA.  This Court Should Preliminarily Enjoin Defendants and Grant a Temporary \nRestraining Order Directing Defendants to Restore the Funds and Enjoining Them \nFrom Taking Back City Funds in the Future \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant must demonstrate (1) a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) that the movant will suﬀer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary injunctive relief; (3) a balance of the equities in the movant’s favor; and (4) a public \ninterest served by issuance of a preliminary injunction. Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F. 3d 42, 58-59 (2d Cir. 2020). �e ﬁnal \ntwo factors—the balance of equities and the public interest—“merge when the Government is the \nopposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). Where, as here, the court is asked to \nenter a mandatory preliminary injunction against the government—commanding a positive act, \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 16 of 29\nrather than seeking to maintain the status quo—the ﬁrst prong of the test for injunctive relief is \nmore exacting, requiring a showing of a ‘clear’ or ‘substantial’ likelihood of success on the merits. \nPharaohs GC, Inc. v. U.S. SBA, 990 F.3d 217, 225 (2d Cir. 2021); Libertarian Party v. Lamont, \n977 F.3d 173, 176-77 (2d Cir. 2020); Mastrovincenzo v. City of New York, 435 F.3d 78, 89 (2d \nCir. 2006).1  \n�e standards for granting a temporary restraining order are the same as those governing \npreliminary injunctions. AFA Dispensing Group B.V. v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 740 F. Supp. 2d \n465 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).  \nB.  Plaintiff has a Clear and Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nIn grabbing back funds that were used for the purposes Congress intended and that were \nreviewed,  analyzed  and  determine  allowable  by  FEMA,  without  providing  notice  or  an \nopportunity to be heard, Defendants thumb their nose entirely at the most basic requirements for \nagency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (“APA”). �e action \nmust be set aside as unlawful because it was plainly arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, \nin violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Further, it was in excess of Defendants’ statutory authority \nand ultra vires. It was done without complying with any of the procedures set out in the governing \ngrant regulations and terms and conditions. Id. §§ 706(A), (B), (C). Defendants grabbed back \nSSP funds that were used for their intended purposes because Defendants wished to thwart the \nCongressional purpose of the program.  In doing so, Defendants violated the Separation of Powers \n \n1 �is same stringent test also applies where the requested injunction would provide the plaintiﬀ \nwith \"all the relief that is sought,” and where the mandated action could not be undone by a \njudgment for defendant on the merits and would eﬀectively irreversibly aﬀect the rights of the \nparties. Lamont, 977 F.3d at 177; Mastrovincenzo, 435 F.3d at 90; Tom Doherty Assocs. v. Saban \nEntm’t, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 33–34 (2d Cir. 1995). �e mandatory relief the City seeks would not \nhave that eﬀect because the City seeks additional relief in the Complaint, i.e. to enjoin the \n“pause” of its SSP funding, and in the event Defendants ultimately prevail they could seek \nrecovery of any portion of the SSP grant through lawful means. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 17 of 29\nof the United States Constitution. And, by imposing new, retroactive grant conditions, Defendants \nviolated the Spending Clause. �e Court should exercise its equitable power to enjoin federal \noﬃcials who act far, far beyond the limitations imposed by federal law and the United States \nConstitution. \n1. Arbitrary and Capricious and Abuse of Discretion. An agency action is arbitrary and \ncapricious when it is not “reasonable and reasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio \nProject, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). �e explanation must show “a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal citation omitted). �e purpose of this requirement \nis to ensure that agencies “oﬀer genuine justiﬁcations for important decisions, reasons that can \nbe scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 758 (2019). Moreover, “an agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated \nby the agency itself.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 43, 50.  \nDefendants  have  oﬀered  no  “genuine,”  “reasonable  and  reasonably  explained” \njustiﬁcation  for  their  actions.  Instead,  federal  oﬃcials  have  made  various  sensational  and \ninaccurate statements on social media, in press releases, and in a lawsuit to which the City is not \na party.  See supra, describing statements by Elon Musk and defendant Hamilton (a “clawback \ndemand” is required because SSP funds were “used to provide shelter for “illegal migrants” at \n“high end hotels” “in violat[ion] of the law”); the Hamilton Declaration (SSP funds must be \npaused because noncitizen migrants released by DHS committed crimes at hotel FEMA approved \nfor lodging); and statements by Secretary Noem (“I have clawed back the full payment” to the \nCity because noncitizen migrants released by DHS committed crimes at hotel FEMA approved \nfor lodging).  �e FEMA “noncompliance” letter repeated some of  the same unsupported \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 18 of 29\nassertions and is no more solid than Defendants’ previous public statements. None of these \nstatements provide a legitimate basis for the money-grab, and most amount to no more than wildly \ninaccurate, ad hoc and/or post-hoc rationalizations, \nFEMA’s assertion in the “noncompliance letter” that the money-grab is justiﬁed by media \nreports of alleged criminal activity at a hotel that FEMA approved for lodging is particularly \nconfounding because the media reports cited in the letter, from October and November 2024, pre-\ndate FEMA’s decision to approve and disburse the City’s SSP funds on February 4, 2025; FEMA \ntoured the hotel in question twice and did not report to the City any concerns about criminal \nactivity, see Jiha Decl. ¶ 22; and no grant conditions or requirements are implicated by FEMA’s \nsupposed  concern.    To  the  extent  the  “noncompliance”  letter  raises  vague  allegations  of \nencouraging aliens to reside in the United States, transporting illegal aliens, harboring, or aiding \nand abetting, these assertions are unsupported: all of the migrants for whom FEMA reimbursed \nthe City were processed and released into the United States by DHS, not the City, and the City \nhas provided FEMA with all the required information about them under the SSP grant terms, \nincluding their names and  A-Numbers.   \nTo the extent Defendants’ reason for the money-grab is their opposition to any spending \nunder the SSP, as demonstrated in statements by defendant Hamilton in his tweets (“Congress \nshould never have passed bills asking FEMA to do this work. �is stops now”) and defendant \nNoem (“all Department grant disbursements [to NGOs]  . . . that . . . touch in any way on \nimmigration, are on hold pending review,” including SSP) that is a matter to take up with \nCongress, which authorized the spending, and is not a basis to take back duly approved SSP \ndisbursements.   \nBy no standard can any of Defendants’ rationalizations be construed as a reasoned \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 19 of 29\nexplanation for taking back $80 million in FEMA grants from the City. Indeed, the money-grab \ndisregarded FEMA’s own review and approval of the City’s grant, including its review of the \ngrant application and budget, which speciﬁed how and for whom the grant would be used and the \nhotels the City would use to provide shelter and the subsequent documentation submitted by the \nCity, which reﬂected actual expenditures and identiﬁed the names, A-numbers, and DHS release \ndates of the persons served.  \n�e grab-back was entirely arbitrary and capricious and, to the extent Defendants had any \ndiscretion to exercise in grabbing grant funds, it was a serious abuse of discretion.   \n2. Contrary to Law. Defendants have no legal authority to grab back SSP funds from the \nCity. Agency action that is contrary to “constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right” is unlawful \nand  must  be  set  aside.  5  U.S.C.  § 706(B)-(C). Agency  interpretations  of  statutes  or  the \nConstitution are not entitled to deference. Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, \n391 (2024) (quoting U.S. v. Morton Salt, 338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950)).   \nCongress has not delegated any authority to Defendants grab back, SSP funds that were \nduly approved and disbursed by the grantmaking agency in accordance with the requirements of \nthe program. Indeed, Defendants are enjoined by TRO from withholding grant funds, including \nSSP grant funds, unless they follow the speciﬁc requirements of the grant. New York v. Trump, \n2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17593, at *9. Defendants have acknowledged this in their ﬁlings in New \nYork v. Trump. See generally Rubin Decl., Ex. C (“Emergency Mot.”). But, neither the SSP grant \nAwards, the NOFOs, nor the federal regulations applicable to the grant (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.100 et \nseq.,) permit Defendants to grab-back disbursed grant funds by reaching into the City’s bank \naccount and taking them.  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 20 of 29\nTo the extent the money grab was based on Defendants’ professed opposition to the SSP \nprogram itself, as articulated by Administrator Hamilton in his tweets (“Congress should never \nhave passed bills asking FEMA to do this work. �is stops now.”) and DHS Secretary Noem in \nher memo (“all Department grant disbursements [to NGOs] . . . that . . . touch in any way on \nimmigration, are on hold pending review,” including SSP), the money grab not only lacked \nstatutory authority, it is a disfavored retroactive action that impaired rights the City possessed \nwith respect to the SSP grants. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988); \nLandgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244 (1994). �e City applied for and was granted the SSP \nfunding to provide shelter and other services to noncitizens encountered and released by DHS \ninto the community under a clear set of requirements and procedures, with which it has complied. \nNo statute gives Defendants the authority to retroactively reverse grants based on a new \npolicy preference or outside of the prescribed processes for recovering grant funds.  \n3. Procedural Violations and Due Process. �e FEMA money grab was lawless agency \naction,  implemented  without  any  adherence  to  “procedure  required  by  law.”  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D). �ere is no “procedure” under applicable law—not the DHS Appropriations Act, the \nSSP Award Letters, the NOFOs, nor 2 C.F.R. 200.100 et seq.—that would enable Defendants to \nreach in to the City’s bank account and take funds that were already approved and disbursed by \nFEMA to the City pursuant to and in accordance with the SSP grants’ terms and conditions, \nwithout any notice or opportunity to contest the action.  Defendants simply did it.  \n�e  February  19,  2025  “noncompliance”  letter  was  not  the  required  notice,  with \nopportunity to contest; it was a pretextual attempt to salvage Defendants’ lawless action.  Not \nonly did the letter fail to identify any actual “noncompliance,” or even any genuine concerns of \nnoncompliance, see supra,  it also failed to cite any authority that would permit a money grab \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 21 of 29\nlike this.  Instead, the letter falsely characterized the grab-back of $80 million as a “withholding” \nof funds and cited various provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations that permit temporary \nwithholdings and suspensions of funding.  See Jiha Decl., Ex. 20 (Noncompliance Letter) at 1, \nciting 2 C.F.R. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.208, 200.339(a), 200§ 200.342.  But, a grab-back of funding that \nhas already been approved and disbursed into a grantees bank account is not the same as \nwithholding funds that have not yet been approved and disbursed.  And Defendants cite no \nauthority at all to justify their money-grab.   \nDefendants eschewed the use of any lawful procedures and took over $80 million from \nthe City without warning, in violation of the procedural requirements of the APA. For the same \nreasons the Defendants’ conduct violated the APA, it also violates the Due Process Clause of the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n4. Separation of Powers. Defendants are not authorized to grab back SSP funds from the \nCity simply because they disagree with the goals of the program. �is violates the Separation of \nPowers doctrine and runs roughshod over the authority of Congress. \nArticle I, Section 1 of the Constitution enumerates that: “[a]ll legislative Powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a \nHouse of Representatives.” U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 1. �e Constitution exclusively grants the \npower of the purse to Congress, not the President, with the executive branch possessing only such \nauthority in relation to Federal funding that Congress has chosen to give it. �e separation of \npowers doctrine represents perhaps the central tenet of our constitution, see, e.g., Trump v. U.S., \n603 U.S. 593, 637-38 (2024); West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723-24 (2022), and consistent \nwith these principles, the executive acts at the lowest ebb of his constitutional authority and power \nwhen he acts contrary to the express or implied will of Congress. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 22 of 29\nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  \nDefendants have expressed hostility to the SSP and openly acknowledged that they do not \nsee Congressional authorization of SSP as a barrier to stopping payments under the grant. FEMA \nActing Administrator Hamilton posted: “Congress should never have passed bills asking FEMA \nto do this work. �is stops now.” Defendant Noem similarly directed DHS to “pause” all funding \nfor NGOs through the SSP. Rubin Decl. Ex. E. Defendants have no authority to ignore and \ndisregard Congressional enactments, including the DHS Appropriations Act, but in grabbing back \n$80 million in funding from the City that was disbursed for the purposes speciﬁed by Congress, \nand in accordance with all applicable grant requirements, laws, and regulations, Defendants are \ndoing just that. \n5. Spending Clause. Defendants cannot unilaterally change the terms and requirements \nof SSP grants in order to grab-back previously approved funding disbursed to the City. �e \nSpending Clause of the Constitution provides that Congress—not the Executive—“shall have \nPower to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the \ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, clause 1. \n“Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power is broad,” but conditions on funding must \nbe “unambiguous[]” and they cannot “surprise[] participating States [or localities] with post \nacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, \n17, 25 (1981). States and localities must have fair notice of conditions on funding and once funds \nhave been accepted pursuant to a federal spending program, however, the Federal government \ncannot alter the conditions attached to those funds so signiﬁcantly as to “accomplish[ ] a shift in \nkind, not merely degree.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 583-84 (2012).  \n�e Second Circuit has held that advance notice of grant conditions may be provided by the \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 23 of 29\nfederal grant-making agency, rather than Congress, “as long [as] they were grounded in statutory \nprovisions, regulations, and other guidelines provided by the Department at the time of the grant.”  \nNew York v. United States DOJ, 951 F.3d 84, 110 (2d Cir. 2020).   \nDefendants have articulated various purported reasons for their money grab, see supra, \nbut none of them explain why they are entitled to grab back $80 million from the City pursuant \nto the DHS Appropriations Act, the SSP Award Letters, the NOFOs, or 2 C.F.R. 200.100 et seq. \n(Indeed,  the  City’s  use  of  SSP  funds  was  entirely  consistent  with  each  of  these.)  �e \n“noncompliance” letter eﬀectively places additional conditions on the City’s SSP funding, by \nmanufacturing pretexts—not based on the SSP grant terms and conditions, with which the City \ncomplied—to reverse FEMA’s decision to award and disburse funds to the City.  �is violates the \nSpending Clause and is unlawful.  \nFurthermore, to the extent Defendants are imposing conditions to undermine SSP because \nthey do not believe the federal government should use its resources to provide services noncitizen \nmigrants, see infra (statements by Musk and defendant Hamilton concerning “house[ing] illegal \nimmigrants” and Secretary Noem referring to “NYC migrant hotels”), this also violates the \nSpending Clause. Grant conditions must be rationally related to the purpose of the grant.  New \nYork v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 172 (1992) (citing Mass. v. United States, 435 U.S. 444 \n(1978)).  Here, the  purpose of the SSP is to provide reimbursement to the City, among others, for \nproviding shelter and other services to migrant noncitizens released from detention by DHS, to \nrelieve DHS the burden of maintaining them.  Defendants cannot impose new requirements on \nSSP that undermine the grant’s very purpose.   \nIn sum, the City has a clear, substantial likelihood of success on its claims that the grab-\nback was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, ultra vires, and in violation of due process, \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 24 of 29\nseparation of powers, and Spending Clause strictures.   \nC.  The City Will Suffer Irreparable Harm in the Absence of Injunctive Relief \n�e City will suﬀer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. 555 U.S. at 20. Irreparable \nharm exists where it involves an “injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual and \nimminent and that cannot be remedied by an award of monetary damages.” New York v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 86 (2d Cir. 2020) (citing New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. \nActavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 660 (2d Cir. 2015)).  \n�e injury caused by the grab-back here is neither remote, nor speculative. Rather, \nDefendants’ surreptitious grab of over $80 million from the City’s bank account constitutes a \nclear, signiﬁcant harm: in an instant, without notice, warning, or opportunity to be heard, the City \nwas  deprived  of  over  $80  million  in  funds  that  it  reasonably  and  properly  relied  on  as \nreimbursement to the City for its own previous expenditures.    \n�e injury suﬀered is also, without question, irreparable, because the funds cannot be \nrecovered in an action for compensatory money damages. �e loss of funding can be remedied \nonly by an action to restore the funds themselves under the APA. As the Second Circuit has \npointed out, “[B]ecause money damages are prohibited in APA actions, they are irreparable.” U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d at 86; see 5 U.S.C. § 702.  \n�e unavailability of money damages poses an even more heightened risk where, as here, \nthe funds were granted under an appropriation that may be exhausted, lapse, or be rescinded \nbefore this action is decided. “Funds appropriated for an agency’s use can become unavailable in \nthree circumstances: if the appropriation lapses; if the funds have already been awarded to other \nrecipients; or if Congress rescinds the appropriation.” City of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban \nDev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C. Cir. 1994). At any moment, whether through the allocation or \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 25 of 29\nreallocation by FEMA of all of the available appropriated funds (including the seized funds), the \nexpiration of the Congressional appropriation for the funds, or by virtue of Congressional action \nto rescind the appropriation before it expires, the City can be deprived of the ability to obtain any \nremedy whatsoever. \nIn fact, the very precariousness of litigation concerning Congressionally appropriated \nfunds creates irreparable harm, leading courts to rule, for example, that “to avoid having its case \nmooted [due to the unavailability of a remedy], a plaintiﬀ must both ﬁle its suit before the relevant \nappropriation lapses and seek a preliminary injunction preventing the agency from disbursing \nthose funds.” Id. at 1427 (“[W]hen an appropriation has lapsed or has been fully obligated, federal \ncourts cannot order the expenditure of funds that were covered by that appropriation.”). �us, the \nSecond Circuit has held that in order to preserve the funds, the plaintiﬀ must not only seek a \npreliminary injunction before the relevant appropriation is exhausted—it must also obtain the \ninjunction. Cty. of Suﬀolk v. Sebelius, 605 F.3d 135, 142 (2d Cir. 2020); see also Rochester Pure \nWaters Dist. v. EPA, 960 F.2d 280 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Cty. of Nassau v. Leavitt, No. 07-816, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 142104 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2009). �e same logic applies here, where the funds \ncould become unavailable through exhaustion, lapse or recission.  \nInjunctive relief is thus required to ensure that there are remedies available to the City in \nthis litigation and that its ability to be made whole does not disappear while the Court considers \nits claims.  In order to preserve the availability of remedies here, the over $80 million in grabbed \nback funds must be ordered returned to the City’s accounts immediately through mandatory \ninjunctive relief, before they eﬀectively disappear through the exhaustion of the funds, or the \nlapse or rescission of the appropriation by Congress. Once any of those take place, the funds will \nbe forever lost to the City, unreachable even by this Court.  In fact, the court’s failure to preserve \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 26 of 29\na plaintiﬀ’s rights unequivocally with a TRO, in the face of the potential impossibility of recovery, \nconstitutes an abuse of discretion. Jacksonville Port Auth. v. Adams, 556 F.2d 52, 57-58 (D.C. \nCir. 1977) (holding that a TRO should have been issued due to the pending expiration of an \nagency’s ability to obligate appropriated funds); Rochester, 960 F.2d at 184 (“It is beyond dispute \nthat a federal court cannot order the obligation of funds for which there is no appropriation. Nor \ncan it be contended that a court may appropriate funds from which an obligation may be made.”); \nOﬃce of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990).  \nGiven that the “noncompliance” letter references the SSP23 grant, for which the City was \npreviously reimbursed, the Defendants must also be barred from unlawfully executing another \nmoney-grab.   \nD.  The Public Interest and the Equities Strongly Favor the City \nAs noted above, when the government is a party, “the ﬁnal two factors in the temporary \nrestraining order analysis—the balance of the equities and the public interest—merge.” Jones v. \nWolf, 467 F. Supp. 3d 74, 93-94 (W.D.N.Y. 2020) (citing Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)); U.S. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., 969 F.3d at 86. �e purpose of interim equitable relief “is not to conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties . . . but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward,” \nbearing in mind “’the overall public interest.’” Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 \nU.S. 571, 580 (2017) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 26). �ese factors weigh overwhelmingly in \nthe City’s favor. \nIt is evident that “[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of an unlawful \nagency action. To the contrary, there is a substantial public interest in having government agencies \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.” League of Women Voters of \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 10     Filed 02/21/25     Page 27 of 29\nU.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation and internal quotations omitted). With \nrespect to appropriated funds, where Congress has made purposeful choices about what should \nbe funded, “there is an overriding public interest both in the particular facet determined by \nCongress, in the evenhanded distribution of the . . . funds, and in the general importance of an \nagency’s faithful adherence to its statutory mandate.” Jacksonville Port Auth. v. Adams, 556 F.2d \nat 59. \n�is same public interest applies in the instant case. Congress made a considered decision \nto appropriate funds to reimburse localities for the provision of shelter and necessary services to \nnon-citizen migrants recently encountered and released by DHS into the community. FEMA \nadhered to that mandate in awarding funds to the City, all of which was in furtherance of the \npublic interest, as determined by Congress, in ensuring that the released migrants received basic \ncare and services for a limited period following their release by DHS into the community. In \ncontrast, the public interest is most assuredly not served by Defendants’ abrupt, baseless reversal \nof $80 million intended to reimburse the City for approved, documented expenditures. �e public \nhas no interest in an agency action taken without rhyme or reason or due notice and process.  Nor \ndoes the public interest lie where such agency action leads to an unrecoverable shortfall in funding \nfor services the City provided to DHS.  \nCONCLUSION \n“[P]articularly when so much is at stake, [] ‘the Government should turn square corners \nin dealing with the people.’” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, \n24 (2020) (quoting St. Regis Paper Co. v. U.S., 368 U.S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting)). \nHere, the executive branch of the Federal government has overstepped the bounds of its authority \nthrough arbitrary and capricious, unmoored decision-making, to the City’s great harm.

On Tuesday, February 11, 2025, at 4:03 pm, the long arm of the federal \ngovernment reached into a central bank account of the City of New York (the “City”) and \ngrabbed $80,481,861.42. It took these funds from the City without any advance notice that it \nwould be doing so and without communicating any decision or rationale to the City. \n2. Defendant U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) had paid that \namount to the City on February 4, 2025 after it had thoroughly reviewed the extensive \nsupporting documentation submitted by the City and approved payment under two federal \ngrants awarded under the Shelter and Services Programs (“SSP”).  \n3. (cid:3680)e federal government achieved this illegal seizure of the City’s funds using an \nAutomatic Clearing House (“ACH”) reversal, a process in which the originator of an ACH \nelectronic funds transfer initiates a request to reverse a payment that has already been processed. \nOriginators are permitted to use the ACH reversal process under very limited and essentially \nministerial circumstances not present here, such as to reverse a duplicate payment, a payment \nmade to an incorrect recipient, or a payment made in the incorrect amount.  \n4. (cid:3680)e money was rightfully the City’s. FEMA oﬀered and awarded the SSP grants \nto oﬀset costs the City incurred for shelter and services it provided to noncitizen migrants who \nwere processed and released into the community by defendant the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”). (cid:3680)e purpose of SSP, as FEMA stated, was to “reliev[e] \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 3 of 64\novercrowding in short-term holding facilities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection”— the \nexact purpose for which the City used the funds.  \n5. As Congress intended, the SSP grants were made to local governments and non-\nproﬁt organizations in border states, such as Texas and Arizona, and other locales, like New \nYork City, receiving the largest inﬂuxes of migrants released by DHS. (cid:3680)e City received these \nfunds only on a reimbursement basis for eligible and compliant expenditures already incurred to \nprovide shelter and services to noncitizen migrants. \n6. Before FEMA transferred these funds to the City on February 4, FEMA had \nalready determined that the funds were eligible for reimbursement: FEMA reviewed the City’s \ngrant applications and awarded the grants, reviewed and approved the City’s budget for each \ngrant, and reviewed and approved the City’s reimbursement request, which included extensive \ndetail as to each migrant who received services and back-up documentation validating the costs \nincurred.  \n7. Despite the fact that FEMA had reviewed and approved the City’s request, and \nissued payment, Defendants grabbed the money back without any administrative process \nwhatsoever. Indeed, as of the morning of February 18, 2025, FEMA’s platform for grant making \nand administration, entitled “FEMA GO” (an acronym for “FEMA Grant Operations”), \ncontinued to indicate that the City’s approved request for $80,481,861.42 was disbursed to the \nCity. \n8. Defendants have made it clear in a series of public statements that they opposed \nthe very purpose for which SSP funds were appropriated by Congress and approved by FEMA \nand that they intended to make sure the funds were recouped and are never paid: \n  Defendant Cameron Hamilton, Senior Oﬃcial Performing the Duties \nof the FEMA Administrator, posted on February 10, 2025, the day \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 4 of 64\nbefore the money grab: “@USCongress should have never passed bills \nin 2023 and 2024 asking FEMA to do this work. . . . (cid:3680)is stops now.” \nhttps://x.com/FEMA_Cam/status/1888923672523489649. \n  Defendant Hamilton similarly advised the Court in this action that he \nbelieves “on its face, SSP funds sheltering and transportation of illegal \naliens.” \n  Defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in announcing the previous \nday’s money grab, posted on February 12, 2025: “I have clawed back \nthe full payment that FEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to \nNYC migrant hotels.” \nhttps://x.com/KristiNoem/status/1889745752924074088. \n  Defendant President Donald Trump told Congress and the nation that \nSSP, and payments to the City thereunder, was a “scam” and he \nbragged about recouping the money and terminating the program. \nhttps://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-congress-transcript-\n751b5891a3265ﬀ1e5c1409c391fef7c.   \n9. (cid:3680)ese and other statements lay bare Defendants’ deep-seated animosity to SSP \nitself. (cid:3680)e intent could not be clearer: Defendants’ aim in grabbing back the funds was not \nrelated to the City’s speciﬁc expenditures or grant compliance at all, but to thwart the very \npurpose of the SSP and to prevent expenditures thereunder to the maximum extent possible.  \n10.  Defendants have acted lawlessly in taking money from the City’s account. \nNo lawful procedure permits Defendants to simply take back grant funds previously approved \nand paid in the manner that they did here. Any review of a grant recipient’s compliance with the \ngrant’s requirements must be done in a manner that is consistent with regulatory procedures, \nwhich do not allow the government to misuse the ACH system to seize money it has already \napproved and paid.  \n11.  Separate and apart from that initial illegal act, Defendants have since \nstarted a process designed to permanently lay claim to the funds under the mask of a pretextual \ncompliance review.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 5 of 64\n12.  First, several hours after grabbing the funds back from the City, \nDefendants, including DHS and FEMA, ﬁled papers in a federal court proceeding in Rhode \nIsland requesting that court’s conﬁrmation that Defendants may permissibly “withhold” FEMA \nfunding from the City, and represented to that court that they intended to provide “notice to New \nYork City regarding the funding pause and will provide the information and process required by \nregulation and the terms and conditions of the award.” Defs.’ Emergency Motion, New York v. \nTrump, No. 1:25-cv-00039 (D.R.I. Feb. 11, 2025), ECF No. 102. FEMA did not tell the Court \nthat, far from merely “withholding” funds, it had already, just hours earlier, unilaterally and \nwithout any notice taken funds from the City’s bank account in the amount that it had \npreviously approved and paid.  \n13.  Further, having stated publicly that it was opposed to spending the funds \naltogether, and having taken the funds without following any lawful process whatsoever, FEMA \nnonetheless represented to the Court that it sought to “withhold” funding solely “on the basis of \nthe applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.” Id. Yet FEMA had not complied \nwith any applicable statutes, regulations, and grant terms and conditions and had illegally taken \nfunds from the City in violation of the same. And, in the same breath, FEMA conceded to the \nCourt that it had paused SSP generally.  \n14.  Next, a week later, Administrator Hamilton sent the City’s Oﬃce of \nManagement and Budget (“City OMB”), which administers the FEMA grants for the City, a \n“Remedy for Noncompliance Letter” dated February 18, 2025 (“noncompliance” letter) that \npurports to set forth “signiﬁcant concerns” that the SSP funds are going towards “illegal \nactivities.” FEMA sent this letter just days after the City publicly announced its intention to sue \nover the money grab.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 6 of 64\n15.  Simply put, the “noncompliance” letter is pretextual, a cover for \nDefendants’ money grab and for Defendants’ suspension of the SSP,. (cid:3680)ey have made clear their \nintent to withhold the funds permanently because they oppose the purposes for which the funds \nwere appropriated, awarded, approved, and paid. (cid:3680)e letter, relying only on unsubstantiated \ncharacterizations of “media reports,” makes allegations of crime and gang activity at the \nRoosevelt Hotel—one of the many locations for which FEMA reimbursed the city for shelter \nand services. Tellingly, the letter omits any mention that FEMA oﬃcials twice visited the \nRoosevelt Hotel in September 2024 and that those visits did not lead to any ﬁndings of alleged \ncriminal activity. In addition, Defendants fail to cite any regulatory authority that supports \ndenying funding to the City under the SSP based on purported criminal activity by those \nreleased by DHS into the community when the City has been assisting DHS in providing \nshelter.  \n16.  Further, the letter makes a show of requesting information to further a \npurported review of the City’s SSP awards for 2024 and 2023 (“SSP24” and “SSP23” and \ncollectively “SSP awards”), but mainly seeks information that OMB previously provided to \nFEMA, and that FEMA already reviewed and approved in order to determine that the claimed \nreimbursements were allowable. Indeed, while the letter alleges the City is somehow \nencouraging illegal immigration, FEMA already conﬁrmed in approving and issuing the \npayment that all funds were used to provide services to individuals who DHS had released from \nits custody into the community.  \n17.  (cid:3680)e letter does not identify any applicable rules or grant terms or \nconditions with which it alleges the City might not have complied. Instead, the letter eﬀectively \n- and improperly - adds new terms and conditions. (cid:3680)e letter is meant to look like it aﬀords the \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 7 of 64\nrequisite administrative process when, in fact, the decision has already been made to deny \npayment to the City because Defendants do not want to pay the City for providing the very \nservices to the very people for the very purposes that Congress appropriated the funds and \nFEMA awarded the grants and approved and made the payments.  \n18.  In fact, Defendants appear to have sent similar letters to many other local \ngovernment SSP recipients. Defendants, having conceded in numerous court ﬁlings that SSP is \nsuspended, appear to be using the ﬁg leaf of compliance review as a means to eﬀectively halt \nSSP in its entirety. Neither Defendants’ money grab from the City nor their suspension of SSP \nhas anything to do with City-speciﬁc grant compliance, but is instead the result of Defendants’ \nnew-found hostility to the very grants they awarded.  \n19.  (cid:3680)is lawsuit challenges two actions by Defendants based on two core \ncontentions. First, Defendants’ money-grab—after FEMA review, approval, and actual payment, \nwithout notice or process of any kind—was, simply put, lawless. It violated federal regulations \nand grant terms, separately had no justiﬁcation in the rules governing ACH electronic funds \ntransfers, was contrary to law and in excess of authority, and contrary to their obligations to \nimplement Congressional appropriations.  \n20.  Second, this lawsuit challenges Defendants’ suspension of SSP – both as \nto the City and program-wide -- and their use of a pretextual compliance review process to mask \nand provide legal cover to the suspension. Whether defendants characterize the suspension as a \n“pause” or “freeze” or a “withholding,” the eﬀect is the same. Defendants have stopped SSP in \nits tracks with respect to the City and with respect to local government grant recipients more \ngenerally. Defendants’ public and court-ﬁled statements make clear that their reason for the \nsuspension is their animus to the program itself and their intent to terminate it, prevent future \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 8 of 64\nreimbursement payments, and recoup previously reimbursed funds to the extent they can. Such \nstoppage is lawless because the program was established by Congress and grants were awarded \nby FEMA pursuant to the program; Defendants do not have the unilateral right to stop the \nprogram simply because they don’t like it.  \n21.   Defendants’ broad and lawless pause or suspension of SSP, and pretextual \nuse of a compliance review process moreover appears to be part of an overarching strategy to \nsuspend or end programs without legal authority and to ﬁnd ways to get around legal rulings \nbarring Defendants from implementing funding freezes, such as orders in New York v. Trump.  \n22.  Because Defendants took the extraordinary and lawless measure of seizing \nmoney from the City’s bank account—by surprise, and without notice—the City seeks the \nextraordinary remedy of mandatory injunctive relief to compel Defendants to return the money \nto the CityDefendants, notwithstanding the post hoc pretense of administrative process, have \nmade it abundantly clear that they intend to withhold permanently every dime FEMA previously \nawarded, approved for reimbursement, and paid to the City. \n23.  Defendants also seek relief to make sure that Defendants do not \nimproperly withhold funds that the City is entitled to receive.  \n24.  Therefore, the City brings this suit for a declaration that the money grab \nand the suspension of SSP and withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds are each arbitrary and \ncapricious, contrary to law, ultra vires and in excess of authority, without observance of lawful \nprocedures, and each violates the Due Process Clause, the separation of powers doctrine, and \nthe Spending Clause. Declaratory and injunctive relief is needed to prevent the harm that would \nresult from Defendants’ unlawful retention of the $80 million they improperly took and from \nDefendants’ unlawful actions to withhold SSP funds, pause, suspension, and/or terminate SSP, \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 9 of 64\nwhich would deprive the City of funds it is entitled to receive under the applicable grant terms \nand conditions.  \nPARTIES \n25.

Congress Appropriated Funds for Local Governments to Assist in Providing Shelter \nand Services to Migrants Released by DHS into the Community \n38.  In 2023, Congress authorized FEMA and U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection (“CBP”) to establish SSP. See Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, Title II, 136 Stat. 4730 (2022). (cid:3680)e stated purpose of SSP is to \nrelieve overcrowding in short-term CBP holding facilities. To that end, the program reimburses \nnon-federal entities providing shelter and related services to noncitizen migrants following their \nrelease from DHS. \n39.  In 2024, Congress, through the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 598 (the “DHS Appropriations Act”), \nauthorized continued funding for SSP. Title II of that Act, entitled Security, Enforcement, and \nInvestigations, provides that $650 million “shall be transferred to ‘Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency—Federal Assistance’ to support sheltering and related activities provided \nby non-Federal entities, in support of relieving overcrowding in short term holding facilities of \nthe U.S. Customs and Border Protection.”1 \n \n1 See also FEMA, Shelter and Services Program, https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-\nprogram (last visited Feb. 13, 2025) (“SSP provides financial support to non-federal entities to \nprovide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS). The intent is to support CBP in the safe, orderly, and \nhumane release of noncitizen migrants from short-term holding facilities.”).  \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 12 of 64\nB.  (cid:3680)e 2023 SSP Grant \n40.  FEMA awarded the City $106.9 million under the SSP23 grant and, to \ndate, has reimbursed the City $70.6 million for allowable costs under the grant.  \n41.  FEMA’s stated purpose in oﬀering the SSP23 Grant was:  \nTo provide funding to non-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants \nrecently released from DHS custody to temporarily provide shelter, food, \ntransportation, acute medical care, personal hygiene supplies, and labor \nnecessary to manage cases to provide these services; and,  \nTo provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to \ntemporarily shelter noncitizen migrants recently released from DHS custody, \nincluding renovations and modiﬁcations to existing facilities. \nNotice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”) for SSP23 at 6. (cid:3680)e SSP23 NOFO further states \nFEMA’s “priority” of the “safe, orderly, and humane release of noncitizen migrants from DHS \nshort-term holding facilities.” Id.  \n42.  FEMA issued the SSP23 NOFO on June 12, 2023. (cid:3680)e City, acting \nthrough City OMB, applied for the SSP23 Grant on July 12, 2023. FEMA initially awarded the \nCity a grant of $104.7 million by notice eﬀective August 11, 2023, which FEMA increased to \n$106.9 million on September 28, 2023. (cid:3680)e City’s application for the SSP23 Grant included a \nlist of all the locations for which the City indicated it might seek reimbursement, including a \nlocation called the Roosevelt Hotel.  \n43.  In May 2023, the City began using the Roosevelt Hotel – which had \nclosed as a hotel for guests in December 2020 -- as an Arrival Center for noncitizen migrants \nreleased by DHS into the U.S., and as a Humanitarian Response and Relief Center as part of the \nCity’s response to the inﬂux of noncitizen migrants released by DHS. (cid:3680)e facility functioned as \na centralized intake center for noncitizen migrants who were newly arriving in New York City \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 13 of 64\nfollowing their release by DHS and it provided them with a variety of supportive services \nincluding short-term shelter. \n44.  City OMB submitted two requests for partial reimbursement under the \nSSP23 Grant.  \n45.  In connections with both reimbursement requests, OMB submitted to \nFEMA the name, Alien Registration Number (“A-Number”), and other information for each \nindividual to whom the City provided eligible services for which the City was seeking \nreimbursement under the grant.2 (cid:3680)is reimbursement information included the date DHS \nreleased each individual from DHS custody (“DHS Release Date”). Per the grant terms, FEMA \nwould only reimburse the City for shelter and services provided within 45 days of the \nindividual’s release. FEMA reviewed all of this information in determining that the City’s \nreimbursement request was for allowable costs and in determining to make the payment. \nPursuant to the grant award documents, FEMA provided reimbursements to the City on a per \ndiem basis, meaning that City OMB received a payment for a ﬁxed amount per person for each \nnight an individual received shelter and services that were being reimbursed by FEMA. Fixed \nper diems were established separately for lodging, food, and other types of eligible services.  \n46.  On May 21, 2024, City OMB submitted its ﬁrst request for reimbursement \nin the amount of $32 million. FEMA reviewed the request and requested additional \n \n2 The requirement that A-Numbers be submitted to FEMA may be in response to a March 28, \n2023 report issued by the DHS Office of Inspector General concerning a different program, the \nEmergency Food and Shelter Program (“EFSP”), entitled “FEMA should Increase Oversight to \nPrevent Misuses of Humanitarian Relief Funds.” See ECF No. 17-1, Ex. 3 (\"OIG Report”). The \nOIG Report found in part that in administering the EFSP, FEMA did not adequately ensure that \nlocal grant recipients in California, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas provided adequate \ndocumentation concerning the individuals they served and that some families and individuals \nserved by EFSP did not have an encounter record with DHS. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 14 of 64\ndocumentation which City OMB provided. On July 25, 2024, FEMA approved reimbursement \nin the reduced amount of $25.5 million. \n47.  FEMA initiated a compliance review audit of the ﬁrst payment request \nunder the SSP23 Grant that included a “joint ﬁnancial and programming site visit.” As part of \nthe visit, oﬃcials from FEMA and CBP toured the Roosevelt Hotel and another facility on \nSeptember 9, 2024. Apart from the Compliance Review, FEMA oﬃcials also visited the \nRoosevelt Hotel on September 26, 2024.  \n48.  On October 16, 2024, City OMB submitted a second reimbursement \nrequest to FEMA in the amount of $45.1 million.  \n49.  On November 29, 2024, FEMA provided its compliance review ﬁndings \nregarding the SSP23 Grant to OMB by letter. FEMA made ﬁndings in three areas: (1) data \nprivacy protections for A Numbers, (2) contract provisions, and (3) certain ﬁnancial \nmanagement issues. FEMA did not identify any purported gang or illegal activities at the \nRoosevelt Hotel in its Compliance Review Findings. \n50.   FEMA approved and paid the City’s second reimbursement request in the \namount of $45.1 million on January 7, 2025. To date, the City has received $70.6 million in \nreimbursement from FEMA under the SSP23 Grant. Under the grant terms, $36.3 million \nremains available for claiming reimbursement of allowable costs. \nC.  (cid:3680)e SSP24 Grants  \n51.  On April 12, 2024, FEMA issued two NOFOs for the $650 million \nCongress had appropriated for SSP24 Grants. One NOFO announced an allocation grant, \nmeaning that the amount the City and other speciﬁed local governments and nongovernmental \norganizations could apply for were pre-determined on an allocation basis (“SSP-A Grant”). (cid:3680)e \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 15 of 64\nother NOFO announced a competitive grant—that is, the City’s application would compete with \nothers for an award from a limited set of funds (“SSP-C Grant”) (collectively, the SSP24 \nGrants”).3 FEMA issued an amended SSP-A NOFO on August 28, 2024 and an amended SSP-C \nNOFO on October 21, 2024.4  \n52.  Both SSP24 Grants have an expected period of performance of 36 months, \nfrom October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2026.  \n53.  Echoing the SSP23 Grant NOFO, the SSP24 Grant NOFOs described the \nSSP as follows: \nAs directed by Congress, SSP makes federal funds available to enable non-\nfederal entities to oﬀ-set allowable costs incurred for services associated with \nnoncitizen migrants recently encountered and released by DHS. As stated in \nthe FY 2024 appropriation, the primary purpose of SSP is to “reliev[e] \novercrowding in short-term holding facilities of [CBP].” …. \n(cid:3680)e Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has committed to bolstering the \ncapacity of non-federal entities to receive noncitizens after they have been \nprocessed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and released from a \nDHS facility. DHS is committed to ensuring appropriate coordination with \nand support for state, local, and community leaders to help mitigate increased \nimpacts to their communities as outlined in the DHS Plan for Southwest \n \n3 The grant identification number is DHS-24-GPD-141-00-98.

(cid:3680)e NOFOs described the goals of SSP as “the safe, orderly, and humane \nrelease of noncitizen migrants from DHS short-term holding facilities.” (cid:3680)e objectives of the \nprogram include providing funding for non-federal entities that serve “noncitizen migrants \nrecently released from DHS custody” to “temporarily provide shelter, food, transportation, acute \nmedical care, [and] personal hygiene supplies.”  \n55.  (cid:3680)e NOFOs specify the allowable (i.e., reimbursable) activities under the \nSSP, including providing shelter at hotels and motels and providing food, medical supplies, \nclothes and personal hygiene products. SSP-A NOFO at 69 et seq.; SSP-C NOFO at 64 et seq.  \n56.  As noted above, the FY 2024 SSP appropriation provided $650 million for \nSSP, including FEMA administration costs. (cid:3680)e SSP-A funds were allocated to grantees in two \nrounds, with allocations based on release and destination data received from CBP. (cid:3680)e NOFO \nreleased on April 12, 2024 announced $300 million in round 1 allocations and the amended \nNOFO released on August 28, 2024 announced round 2 (Reserve Fund) allocations. New York \nCity was allocated $38.86 million for round 1 and $20.4 million for round 2.  \n57.  Millions of dollars were also allocated for non-proﬁt organizations and \nlocal governments across the country, including more than $60 million for speciﬁed cities, \ncounties, and not-for-proﬁts in Texas, $10.8 million for Fulton County, Georgia, $11.6 million \nto Maricopa County, Arizona, and $21.8 million to Pima County, Arizona. \n58.  (cid:3680)e remaining $340.9 million was released through SSP-C grants. See \nSSP-A NOFO at 5; SSP-C NOFO at 7. (cid:3680)ese grants were awarded on a competitive basis, to \nlocal governments and nonproﬁt organizations that submitted grant proposals evaluated by \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 17 of 64\nFEMA. In addition, “$9.1 million was set aside for FEMA management and administrative \ncosts.” SSP-A NOFO at 5.  \n59.  (cid:3680)e SSP-A NOFO lists the “Performance Measures for SSP awardees” as: \n  Number of meals provided. \n  Number of nights of lodging provided. \n  Number of noncitizen migrants transported. \n  Number of acute medical care items provided, by type. \n  Number of personal hygiene supplies provided, by type. \n  Number of hours of labor paid to manage cases to provide these \nservices. \n  Number of clothing items provided. \n  Number of noncitizen migrants served through translation services. \n  Number of noncitizen migrants served through outreach activities. \n  Number of renovation or modiﬁcations to existing facilities projects \ncompleted. \nSSP-A NOFO at 7; SSP-C NOFO at 6.  \n60.   FEMA “calculate[s] and analyze[s] the [enumerated] metrics through a \nreview of performance progress reports and award monitoring to ensure that the funds are \nexpended for their intended purpose and achieve the stated outcomes in the grant application.” \nId. \n61.  To complete an SSP-A or SSP-C application, applicants must submit \nbudget information, standard assurances, and worksheets, with program-speciﬁc certiﬁcations \nand budget instructions. SSP-A NOFO at 28-29; SSP-C NOFO at 18-19. (cid:3680)e applicant must \nalso agree to the terms and conditions of the award. SSP-A NOFO at 11; SSP-C NOFO at 11.  \n62.  To obtain FEMA’s approval to draw down funds, grantees must submit for \nFEMA’s review additional information and documentation, including “[a] summary list \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 18 of 64\nreporting A[lien]-Numbers, names, corresponding DHS release dates of the served population, \nand corresponding service dates of the served population.” SSP-A NOFO at 29; SSP-C NOFO \nat 19. “For each requested allowable activity service category” the grantee must “provide one \nexample of proof of payment (e.g., canceled check, credit card statement, etc.) and a receipt \nreﬂecting the purchase.” Id. Additional documentation requirements apply for reimbursement of \npurchases above $5,000. Id.  \n63.  (cid:3680)e SSP grants provide for reimbursement for shelter and services \nprovided to those migrants who DHS determined to release into the United States. For that \nreason, grantees must submit the name, valid A-Number, and corresponding DHS release date \nfor every person for whom the grantee seeks FEMA reimbursement. SSP-A NOFO at 29; SSP-C \nNOFO at 19. (cid:3680)us, FEMA provides reimbursement for shelter and services provided to a given \nindividual only after FEMA veriﬁes that the individual has a valid A-Number and was released \nby DHS into the community.  \n64.   (cid:3680)e NOFOs specify that all funds for which the applicant sought \nreimbursement “must comply with applicable statutes, rules and regulations, and policies, this \nNOFO, and the terms and conditions of the federal award. (cid:3680)ey must also comply with the \nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements at 2 C.F.R. \nPart 200.” SSP-A NOFO at 30, SSP-C NOFO at 21. (cid:3680)e NOFOs also incorporate by reference \nthe FY 2024 DHS Standard Terms and Conditions. SSP-A NOFO at 38; SSP-C NOFO at 32.  \ni.  The Grant Awards  \n65.  On April 24, 2024, the City, acting through its Oﬃce of Management and \nBudget (“City OMB”) submitted an application to FEMA for an SSP-A grant for \n$38,864,884.00, the maximum amount then allocated to New York City as set forth in the SSP-\n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 19 of 64\nA NOFO prior to amendment. On June 11, 2024, City OMB submitted an application to FEMA \nfor an SSP-C grant for $34,090,000, the maximum amount permitted for a single applicant. \n66.  (cid:3680)e City’s applications included detailed budget worksheets for FEMA’s \nreview. All costs are budgeted on a per diem basis, with separate line items for, among other \nthings, meals, security, case coordination, and medical. For example, the budgeted per diem cost \nsubmitted by the City for a night of hotel lodging is $62.19.  \n67.  On July 8, 2024, the City received its award letter for round 1 of SSP-A \nfunding, for $38.86 million (“SSP-A Award Letter”). Subsequently, on September 11, 2024, \nFEMA approved an additional $20.4 million in round 2 funds for the City.  \n68.  On September 17, 2024, the City received its award letter for SSP-C \nfunding, for $22 million (“SSP-C Award Letter” and collectively with the SSP-A Award Letter, \n“Award Letters”).  \n69.  To accept the SSP-A and SSP-C grants funds, the City was required to \nagree to the terms set forth in the NOFOs and Award Letters. See SSP-A Award Letter at 1, SSP-\nC Award Letter at 1.  \n70.  (cid:3680)e Award Letters further incorporated by reference the terms of 2 C.F.R. \nPart 200 and the NOFOs. SSP-A Award Letter, Arts. 2, 28; SSP-C Award Letter Arts. 2, 28. \nAdditionally, the Award Letters provide that FEMA must inform the grantee in writing if an \n“error has been made [in a grant package], or if an administrative change must be made” to a \ngrant. SSP-A Award Letter, Art. 44; SSP-C Award Letter Art 44.  \n71.  (cid:3680)e City opted to receive grant payments on a reimbursement basis, \nmeaning that the grantee must obtain FEMA’s approval of a grant budget—namely the line \nitems of expected expenditures for which reimbursement will be made—and only following \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 20 of 64\nbudget approval, the grantee may submit a documented request for reimbursement for approved \nexpenditures that have already been made.  \n72.  (cid:3680)e Award Letters were issued with a funding hold: as set forth in the \nNOFOs, in order to obligate or draw down SSP grant funds, the City is required to submit a \n“detailed cost breakdown and justiﬁcation.” SSP-A Award Letter Art. 48; SSP-C Award Letter \nArt. 48.  \nii.  FEMA’s Approval of the City’s Grant Budgets and \nPayment of Reimbursements \n73.  On November 27, 2024, City OMB submitted to FEMA the detailed cost \nbreakdown and justiﬁcation required in support of a future reimbursement request for both the \nSSP-A and SSP-C grants.  \n74.  Following a review process, FEMA approved the City’s SSP24 grant \nbudgets on January 8 and 10, 2025, respectively. \n75.  On January 14, 2025, City OMB submitted to FEMA a request for \nreimbursement of $22,169,838.00 of expenditures for its Fiscal Year 2024 SSP-C grant and on \nJanuary 15, 2025, City OMB submitted to FEMA a request for reimbursement of costs in the \namount of $59,302,125.07 for its Fiscal Year 2024 SSP-A grant, together representing the \nentirety of the SSP grant awards to the City for Fiscal Year 2024.  \n76.   In support of the payment requests, City OMB submitted all of the \ndocumentation required by FEMA including the name and A-Number for each individual, and \ninvoices and other documentation of expenditures. \n77.  On January 31, 2025, following its review of the City’s submissions, \nFEMA informed the City that the reimbursement for each of the SSP grants would need to be \nreduced slightly to account for an error rate of roughly 1.22% in matching the A-Numbers to \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 21 of 64\neligibility for reimbursement and indicated that it would approve and make payment upon a \nrequest for the reduced amount.  \n78.  (cid:3680)e City resubmitted to FEMA revised payment requests for the two \ngrants in the amounts of $58,581,446.08 and $21,900,415.34, respectively, as pre-authorized by \nFEMA. (cid:3680)e amounts in the revised payment requests reﬂected the reduction of 1.22% that \nFEMA required from the City’s initial payment requests to account for FEMA’s 1.22% error rate \nﬁnding. (cid:3680)e remaining balance—roughly $1 million between the two grants—remains available \nfor future reimbursement of allowable expenses based on a subsequent submission.  \n79.  On February 4, 2025, the City received payments by ACH transfer to the \nCity’s central treasury account of $58,581,446.08 and $21,900,415.34, the full amount that \nFEMA had approved for reimbursement to the City. \n80.  FEMA’s approval and payment of these amounts constitutes FEMA’s \ndetermination—after thoroughly reviewing budget details, expenditure documentation, and \npersonal information of migrants—that the funds FEMA approved and disbursed were \nallowable under the grant terms and conditions.  \nD.  (cid:3680)e Trump Administration Changes Policy and Unlawfully Freezes Federal Funding \n81.  On January 20, 2025, defendant President Donald Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14159, entitled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” (“Invasion EO”). The \nInvasion EO states that “[o]ver the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, \nand oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States.” As a result, \nthe EO asserts, “[m]illions of illegal aliens” crossed the border and were “allowed to settle in \nAmerican communities.” The EO states that many of the people the federal government \nadmitted and allowed to settle here “present significant threats to national security and public \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 22 of 64\nsafety” and that many have “abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence \nin the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.” \nInvasion EO § 1. \n82.  The Invasion EO further asserts that it is the “the policy of the United \nStates to achieve the total and efficient enforcement” of its immigration laws and issues a wide-\nranging series of instructions to various persons and agencies within the federal government. \n83.  The Invasion EO requires federal agencies to immediately pause funding to \nnon-governmental organizations providing services to “illegal aliens. ” Invasion EO § 19. The \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall: \n(a) Immediately review and, if appropriate, audit all contracts, grants, or \nother agreements providing Federal funding to non-governmental \norganizations supporting or providing services, either directly or \nindirectly, to removable or illegal aliens, to ensure that such agreements \nconform to applicable law and are free of waste, fraud, and abuse, and that \nthey do not promote or facilitate violations of our immigration laws; \n(b) Pause distribution of all further funds pursuant to such agreements \npending the results of the review in subsection (a) of this section; \n(c) Terminate all such agreements determined to be in violation of law or \nto be sources of waste, fraud, or abuse and prohibit any such future \nagreements; \n(d) Coordinate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nto ensure that no funding for agreements described in subsection (c) of this \nsection is included in any appropriations request for the Department of \nJustice or the Department of Homeland Security; and \n(e) Initiate clawback or recoupment procedures, if appropriate, for any \nagreements described in subsection (c) of this section.  \n \n84.  (cid:3680)e Invasion EO did not, on its face, order a comparable “pause” with \nrespect to state and local governments.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 23 of 64\n85.  On January 27, 2025, the United States Office of Management and Budget \nissued a “Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies” entitled \n“Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance” (“OMB Directive”). \n(cid:3680)e OMB Directive directed federal agencies to “identify and review all Federal ﬁnancial \nassistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the President’s policies and \nrequirements,” as set forth in the Invasion EO and various other EOs.5  \n86.  (cid:3680)e OMB Directive required federal agencies to implement the Invasion \nEO and other EOs by “complet[ing] a comprehensive analysis of all of their Federal ﬁnancial \nassistance programs to identify programs, projects, and activities that may be implicated by any \nof the President’s executive orders.” In the meantime, the OMB Directive ordered that federal \nagencies “to the extent permissible under applicable law … pause all activities related to \nobligation or disbursement of all Federal ﬁnancial assistance, and other relevant agency \nactivities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, ﬁnancial \nassistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the \ngreen new deal.”  \n87.  On January 28, 2025, Defendant DHS secretary Kristi Noem issued a \n“Memorandum for Component and Oﬃce Heads” entitled “Direction on Grants to Non-\n \n5 The other EOs specifically encompassed in the OMB Directive included EOs entitled \nReevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid (Jan. 20, 2025), Putting America First in \nInternational Environmental Agreements (Jan. 20, 2025), Unleashing American Energy (Jan. 20, \n2025), Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing (Jan. 20, \n2025), Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to \nthe Federal Government (Jan. 20, 2025), and Enforcing the Hyde Amendment (Jan. 24, 2025). \nMany of these EOS ordered federal agencies to pause federal funding to grantees, including \nstates and local governments, that touched on particular policy areas, such as the Electric Vehicle \nCharging, programs included in the “green new deal” and DEI programs. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 24 of 64\ngovernmental Organizations” (“Noem Memo”). Echoing the Invasion EO, the Noem Memo \nstated that “over the last four years, the Department of Homeland Security has spent billions of \ndollars funding illegal immigrants.” (cid:3680)e Noem Memo went on to direct “[e]ﬀective \nimmediately, all [DHS] grant disbursements and assessments of grant applications that (a) go to \nnon proﬁt organizations or for which non-proﬁt organizations are eligible, and (b) touch in any \nway on immigration, are on hold, pending review, except to the extent required by controlling \nauthority.” (cid:3680)e Noem Memo speciﬁed that the “pause” applied to SSP.  \n88.  Also on January 28, 2025, a coalition of 22 States, including the State of \nNew York, brought a lawsuit against various federal defendants in the District of Rhode Island \nseeking to temporarily restrain and preliminarily and permanently enjoin the across-the-board \npause on federal funding disbursement ordered in the OMB Memo. See generally New York v. \nTrump, No. 25-cv-39-JJM-PAS (D.R.I. filed Jan. 28, 2025) (hereinafter “New York v. Trump”). \nDefendants in New York v. Trump included the following defendants in the instant lawsuit \nPresident Trump, Treasury Department, Secretary Bessent, Treasurer Collins, FEMA, Acting \nAdministrator Hamilton, DHS, and Secretary Noem. \n89.  (cid:3680)e court in New York v. Trump granted the TRO application on January \n21, 2025 and the preliminary injunction motion on March 6, 2025.  \n90.  In granting the TRO, the court held that the plaintiff States were likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claims because there was “no federal law” that authorized the \ndefendants to “unilaterally suspend[] the payment of federal funds to the States and others \nsimply by choosing to do so, no matter the authorizing or appropriating statute, the regulatory \nregime, or the terms of the grant itself.” TRO at 5; 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17593, at *11. The \ncourt held that the defendants’ refusal to disburse funds appropriated by Congress was arbitrary \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 25 of 64\nand capricious and a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and that defendants’ effort to \nimpose conditions on funding was likewise unlawful. Id.  \n91.  The Court ordered the defendants not to “pause, freeze, impede, block, \ncancel, or terminate Defendants’ compliance with awards and obligations to provide federal \nfinancial assistance to the States,” and not to “impede the States’ access to such awards and \nobligations, except on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.” \nThe court further ordered: \nIf Defendants engage in the “identif[ication] and review” of federal financial \nassistance programs, as identified in the OMB Directive, such exercise shall \nnot affect [sic] a pause, freeze, impediment, block, cancellation, or \ntermination of Defendants’ compliance with such awards and obligations, \nexcept on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and \nterms. \nDefendants shall comply with all notice and procedural requirements in the \naward, agreement, or other instrument relating to decisions to stop, delay, or \notherwise withhold federal financial assistance programs. \n \nId. at 12.  \n92.  (cid:3680)e TRO also barred defendants from adopting the substance of the OMB \nMemo “under any other name or title or through any other Defendants” and required defendants \nto provide written notice of the TRO to “all Defendants and agencies and their employees, \ncontractors, and grantees by Monday, February 3, 2025, at 9 a.m.” Id.  \nE.

On or about February 5, 2025, the day after FEMA duly disbursed the \nover $80 million reimbursement payment to the City under the SSP24 Grants, Mary Comans, \nthen-Chief Financial Officer of FEMA and a veteran of the agency since 2017, “participated in \nan in-person meeting with leadership of FEMA and DHS, including Acting DHS General \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 26 of 64\nCounsel Joseph Mazzara, and two DOGE6 team members: Brad Smith and John Burham. \nAnother DOGE team member, Kyle Schutt, participated by phone.” Declaration of Mary \nComans dated February 25, 2025 (“Comans Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-2, Does v. Elon Musk, No. 8:25-cv-\n00462-TDC (D.M.D. filed Feb. 13, 2025) (“Does v. Musk”), ECF No. 36 at 49.7  \n94.  The DOGE team members said “they were embedded at U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services but were there to help as the DHS DOGE members onboarded.” \nIn particular, the DOGE team members “wanted to ensure that FEMA was not sending money \nto non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) that aided undocumented immigrants through the \n‘Shelter and Services Program’ grant that FEMA administers for U.S. Custom and Border \nProtection.” Comans Decl. ¶ 3.  \n95.  At the meeting “one of the DOGE members, asked FEMA’s leadership \nteam whether they had stopped all payments to NGOs,” and FEMA confirmed that it had. Id. \nThe DOGE staff member “then asked about payments to state and local governments. The \nFEMA representative said those payments were being continued. Wagging his finger for \nemphasis, [the DOGE staffer] affirmed, ‘that’s the right answer.’” Comans Decl. ¶ 4.  \n \n6 “DOGE” stands for “Department of Government Efficiency” as set forth in an executive order \ndated January 20, 2025 entitled “Establishing and Implementing the President’s “Department of \nGovernmental Efficiency.”  \n7 Does v. Musk is a class action lawsuit challenging DOGE’s role in terminating federal \nemployees at various federal agencies. Comans is also challenging circumstances surrounding \nher own termination in a separate lawsuit styled Mary Comans v. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, No. 25-cv-00624-ACR (D. D.C. filed Mar. 4, 2025) (“Comans v. DHS”), alleging \namong other things that DHS and FEMA “willfully and/or intentionally terminated Ms. Comans’ \nemployment with Defendant FEMA in a manner that was derogatory to her reputation” and in \ndoing so, relied on “information and conclusions [that] were false, malicious, defamatory, \nincomplete, inaccurate, and untimely . . .” Complaint ¶ 21, Comans v. DHS, ECF No. 1.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 27 of 64\n96.  However, four days later, on “February 9, 2025, around 5:00 PM, a DOGE \nteam member embedded at the Treasury Department flagged that FEMA had recently paid New \nYork City tens of millions of dollars” under SSP “to reimburse New York City for eligible \nexpenses incurred for the care and sheltering services the City had provided to migrants \nfollowing their release from DHS custody.” Comans Decl. ¶ 7. Comans then personally “spent \nthe entire evening analyzing the amount of funds paid and in what manner.” Id.  \n97.  The following morning, on Monday, February 10, 2025 at 5:03 am, Elon \nMusk, in a post filled with blatant errors, posted that DOGE had “discovered” a $59 million \npayment from FEMA to the City “to house illegal immigrants” in “high-end hotels,” that a \n“demand” would be made for the return of the funds, that the funds were meant for disaster \nrelief and that “sending this money violated the law”: \n \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 28 of 64\nhttps://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888891512303263815.  \n98.  As detailed above, the funds were approved and disbursed pursuant to \nSSP, exactly as authorized and intended by Congress and awarded, approved, and paid by \nFEMA.  \n99.  Contrary to Musk’s post, the funds were not used to pay for “luxury \nhotels,” but rather to pay the FEMA-approved rate of $62.19 per person for lodging in any of \nthe more than 220 hotels, motels, or other facilities that FEMA reviewed and approved. Further, \nFEMA paid only for shelter and service to migrants who FEMA conﬁrmed before making \npayment had a DHS-issued A-Number and who DHS released from its custody into the \ncommunity.  \n100.  Two hours after Musk’s post, at 7:01 a.m., defendant Acting \nAdministrator Hamilton reposted it and added: “I want to thank the @DOGE team for making \nme aware of this. Effective yesterday these payments have all been suspended from FEMA. \nPersonnel will be held accountable.” https://x.com/FEMA_Cam/status/1888921176199635266. \nActing Administrator Hamilton here appears to be instituting a “pause” or “suspension” of the \nFEMA payments— via a post on X—on Monday February 10 (purportedly “[e]ffective \nyesterday”, i.e. Sunday, February 9). City OMB was not notified of this, and on information and \nbelief, neither was any other grantee. Further, the funds FEMA approved for reimbursement to \nthe City had already been paid to the City six days earlier.  \n101.  Acting Administrator Hamilton followed up ten minutes later at 7:11 a.m. \nwith another post acknowledging that the SSP funds provided to the City were in fact \nappropriated by Congress for the very purpose for which the City used them, stating: \n“@USCongress should have never passed bills in 2023 and 2024 asking FEMA to do this \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 29 of 64\nwork.” (Emphasis added.) Notwithstanding his acknowledgment of Congress’ express \nappropriation, Acting Administrator Hamilton stated: “This stops now.” \nhttps://x.com/FEMA_Cam/status/1888923672523489649.  \n \n102.  The statement could not be clearer: Defendants’ purpose for grabbing back \nthe funds was to stop the SSP program entirely. It was not related to City-specific costs or City-\nspecific compliance issues, but was designed to thwart the very purpose for which Congress \nappropriated the funds and FEMA awarded, approved, and disbursed them.  \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 30 of 64\n103.  Following the tweets from Musk and defendant Acting Administrator \nHamilton, Comans “spent all day on Monday, February 10, 2025, recouping the funds from \nNew York City, which ultimately totaled $80 million dollars.” Comans Declaration ¶ 9. At 3:45 \np.m. that day, “FEMA’s Acting Administrator [Hamilton] sent an email to DHS conﬁrming that \nthe process to claw back funding was occurring” and at 5:29 p.m. Comans “reported to [] \nleadership that [she] had successfully coordinated with Treasury and the funds were being \nreturned.” Id.  \n104.  Based on her “experience and the interactions [she] witnessed,” Comans \nconcluded “there was a sudden policy change concerning whether FEMA could send resources \nto state and local governments.” Comans Decl. ¶ 10. Comans believed the decision was made \nby DOGE or Elon Musk. Id.  \n105.  The following day, on February 11, 2025, Comans was abruptly \nterminated “effective immediately” from FEMA and federal employment, via a memorandum \nstating: “[t]his action is being taken pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution, at \nthe direction of the President. Article II, § 1 states that the executive Power ‘shall be vested in a \nPresident of the United States of America,’” and this termination is an exercise of that vested \npower.’” Complaint ¶ 5, Comans v. DHS, ECF No. 1.  \n106.  DHS announced Comans’s termination, along with terminations of three \nother FEMA employees, stating that Comans and her colleagues were ﬁred “for circumventing \nleadership to unilaterally make egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants.” \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/02/11/statement-dhs-spokesperson-termination-4-fema-\nemployees-who-made-payments-luxury; see also Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Top FEMA Oﬃcial Is \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 31 of 64\nFired Over Payments for N.Y.C. Migrant Shelters, N.Y. Times (Feb. 11, 2025), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/fema-ﬁred-nyc-migrant-hotels.html. \n107.  (cid:3680)at same day, on February 11, 2025 at 4:03 pm, $80,481,861.42, \ndisappeared from the City’s central treasury account. (cid:3680)e money disappeared via a reversal of \nthe ACH transfer. Defendants had removed from the City’s bank account the entire amount that \nFEMA had seven days earlier approved for reimbursement and disbursed to the City for the \nSSP-A and SSP-C grants combined. Although the reversal was accomplished within the ﬁve-\nday window for reversals of ACH transfers under the rules and procedures governing automated \nclearinghouse (“ACH”) transfers, those rules do not allow for reversals for the reasons \nDefendants eﬀectuated it, as discussed further below. \n108.  FEMA did not provide any advance notice to the City of the money grab. \nFEMA did not follow any of the measures set forth in the grant terms and conditions or the \nregulations relevant to the grant. In fact, FEMA does not appear to have followed any \nadministrative process at all in grabbing the SSP funds.  \n109.  Nor did FEMA provide any advance notice of any reason or basis to the \nCity for the money grab. Indeed, it did not communicate with the City at all before taking the \nfunds.  \nF.  Defendants Evade (cid:3680)eir Obligations under the TRO  \nthrough Elisions and Distortions of Fact \n110.  As discussed supra, at the time of the money grab, Defendants were \nsubject to a TRO ordering them not to “pause, freeze, impede, block, cancel, or terminate \nDefendants’ compliance with awards and obligations to provide federal ﬁnancial assistance \n…except on the basis of the applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms” and to \n“comply with all notice and procedural requirements in the award, agreement, or other \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 32 of 64\ninstrument relating to decisions to stop, delay, or otherwise withhold federal ﬁnancial assistance \nprograms.” New York v. Trump, ECF No. 50. (cid:3680)is TRO barred Defendants from “pausing” SSP \npursuant to the Invasion EO, the Noem Memo or any other, unilateral, across-the-board pause \non federal funding to grant recipients, including states and local governments.  \n111.  To evade these obligations and create cover for the money grab, at \napproximately 7 p.m. on February 11, 2025—three hours after FEMA had already grabbed the \nSSP24 funds—some of the defendants here ﬁled a motion in New York v. Trump entitled, \n“Emergency Motion. . . for Permission to Continue Withholding FEMA and Other Funding.”  \n112.  (cid:3680)e emergency motion purported to seek conﬁrmation that a \n“withholding” of FEMA funding to the City did not violate the TRO.  \n113.  Without mentioning that FEMA had already taken the funds the \nemergency motion stated that “FEMA seeks to withhold Shelter and Services Program (SSP) \nfunding based on concerns regarding the program” and “respectfully requests conﬁrmation that \nDefendants may permissibly withhold certain FEMA funding, i.e., as ‘a speciﬁc instance where \nthey are acting in compliance with this Order but otherwise withholding funds due to speciﬁc \nauthority.’” Id. (emphasis added).  \n114.  In a declaration accompanying the emergency motion, Defendant Acting \nAdministrator Hamilton represented that FEMA had “paused” SSP funding to the City because \nof concerns the funds were being mis-used by the City and that FEMA would follow all \napplicable processes under the SSP grant and applicable laws and regulations. Speciﬁcally, \nAdministrator Hamilton made the following representations: \n  “As of today, the Department has paused funding to the Shelter and Services \nProgram based on signiﬁcant concerns that the funding is going to entities \nengaged in or facilitating illegal activities.” \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 33 of 64\n  “For example, a substantial portion of Shelter and Services Program money \ngoes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. \nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has \ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of \noperations to plan a variety of crimes.”  \n  “FEMA is in the process of requesting information from New York City to \nfurther investigate this matter to ensure that federal funds are not being used \nfor illegal activities.” \n  “FEMA will begin the process of providing notice to New York City regarding \nthe funding pause and will provide the information and process required by \nregulation and the terms and conditions of the award. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.242.” \nDeclaration of Cameron Hamilton, New York v. Trump, Feb. 11, 2025, ECF No. 102-1 \n(“Hamilton 2/11 Declaration”) ¶¶ 6, 7, 12, 13. (cid:3680)e Hamilton 2/11 Declaration also attached the \nNoem Memo. \n115.  (cid:3680)e Hamilton 2/11 Declaration relied on “media reports,” rather than on \nany fact-based analysis. It did not identify any activity by the City that was inconsistent with \nSSP24 grant conditions or unlawful, except for vague allegations of encouraging aliens to reside \nin the U.S., transporting illegal aliens, harboring, or aiding and abetting. Since all of the \nmigrants for whom FEMA reimbursed the City were, as FEMA itself determined, assigned \nreleased into the community with an assigned A Number by DHS, and the reimbursement was \nfor the express purpose of relieving DHS of the burden of maintaining these individuals in DHS \ncustody, these assertions are faulty and appear to be disingenuous because there is nothing \n“illegal” about providing shelter and services for specific individuals released from DHS \ncustody as specified in the grant.  \n116.  (cid:3680)e Hamilton 2/11 Declaration represented only that, “as of today \n[February 11, 2025]”, FEMA had “paused” SSP and did not inform the court that FEMA had \nalready grabbed back the SSP24 funds without complying with any of the notice or procedural \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 34 of 64\nrequirements in the SSP Award Letters, NOFOs, or applicable federal regulations. (cid:3680)e \nDeclaration did not mention the supposed and unsupported concerns that Musk and defendant \nHamilton articulated on February 10, 2025, before the money grab, about SSP funds going to \nprovide “luxury” accommodations to “illegal aliens.” \n117.  (cid:3680)e Hamilton 2/11 Declaration cites 2 C.F.R. § 200.242, but that provision \ndoes not exist. If Hamilton meant to refer to 2 C.F.R. § 200.342, that provision requires that an \nagency that “initiat[es] a remedy for noncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective \naction plan, or termination)… must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and \nprovide information challenging the action.” No such opportunity was provided before FEMA \ntook the money. And nothing in the provision authorizes the unilateral reversal of an approved \nand completed payment to grab funds out of a grantee’s bank account. \n118.  (cid:3680)e court denied the emergency motion on February 12, 2025, stating: \nAs to FEMA funds to New York City, the Defendants represent that they \nintend to provide ‘notice to New York City regarding the funding pause and \nwill provide the information and process required by regulation and the terms \nand conditions of the award.’ ECF No. 102-1 at ¶ 13. Because the Defendants \nare seeking to terminate funding ‘on the basis of the applicable authorizing \nstatutes, regulations, and terms,’ ECF No. 50 at 12 (emphasis added), the \nCourt sees no need for further clariﬁcation. \nOrder, New York v. Trump, Feb. 12, 2025, ECF No. 107.  \n119.  (cid:3680)e District Court of Rhode Island thus relied on Defendants’ \nrepresentation that they were seeking merely to “pause” funding to the City “on the basis of the \napplicable authorizing statutes, regulations and terms” when, in fact, Defendants had already \ntaken the SSP24 funds without providing notice to the City and without following any of the \napplicable statutes, regulations and terms.  \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 35 of 64\n120.  (cid:3680)e day after the ﬁling in New York v. Trump, on February 12, 2025, at \n1:37 pm, defendant DHS Secretary Kristi Noem repeated the unsupported statements in the \nHamilton 2/11 Declaration, that persons residing in hotels the City used to temporarily shelter \nnon-citizen migrants committed crimes and that approved SSP funds were grabbed back for that \nreason. https://x.com/KristiNoem/status/1889745752924074088. \n \n121.  Defendant Noem’s February 12 message makes clear her hostility and \nopposition to the program itself. \nG. FEMA Issued a “Noncompliance Letter” in a Pretense of Procedural Compliance \n122.  More than a week after the money grab, Defendants began to manufacture \na veneer of the procedural compliance—at least as to the withholding of SSP funds, though not \nfor the unilateral removal of the funds from the City’s bank account—that defendant Hamilton \nhad represented in court ﬁlings they were following. On February 19, 2025, Neil (cid:3680)ompson, the \nDeputy Assistant Director at City OMB, received a letter, dated February 18, 2025, from \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 36 of 64\nHamilton with the subject line “Remedy for Noncompliance Letter, Shelter and Services \nProgram (SSP).” \n123.  (cid:3680)e letter purports to “notify [City OMB] that DHS/FEMA is temporarily \nwithholding payments to [City OMB]” for three grant awards: the SSP23 and both SSP24 \nGrants. (cid:3680)e letter admits that FEMA had already grabbed back the SSP-A and SSP-C grant \nawards paid to the City, stating that FEMA “recovered two payments completed via direct \ndeposit on February 4, 2025, totaling $80,481,861.42.”  \n124.  (cid:3680)e letter states that DHS/FEMA is withholding funds pursuant to 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.339(a), which providesthat “[w]hen [a] Federal agency . . . determines that \nnoncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing speciﬁc conditions, the Federal agency . . . \nmay . . . (a) temporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes corrective \naction.” But the letter also states, inconsistently with the above, that FEMA “is instituting \nspeciﬁc conditions on [the City’s] award pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.208.”  \n125.  2 C.F.R. § 200.208 allows federal agencies to adjust speciﬁc conditions in \nthe Federal award based on analysis of the following factors: \n(1) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data (for \nexample, SAM.gov) or review of its risk assessment (See § 200.206); \n(2) (cid:3680)e recipient’s or subrecipient’s history of compliance with the terms and \nconditions of Federal awards; \n(3) (cid:3680)e recipient’s or subrecipient’s ability to meet expected performance \ngoals as described in § 200.211; or \n(4) A determination of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate \nﬁnancial capability to perform the Federal award. \n126.  None of the foregoing factors are discussed in the “noncompliance” letter \nnor do they appear to be within the scope of the concerns set forth in the letter.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 37 of 64\n127.  (cid:3680)e letter also fails to note that FEMA may not initiate a remedy for \n“noncompliance,” such as withholding funds, without providing notice to the City and an \nopportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. 2 C.F.R. § 200.342.  \n128.  (cid:3680)e letter also omits reference to regulations providing that “payments for \nallowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless \nrequired by Federal statute, regulations,” or “(cid:3680)e recipient … has failed to comply with the \nterms and conditions of the Federal award; or… is delinquent in a debt.” CFR § 200.305(b)(6) \n(emphasis added). If “such conditions” are met, “the Federal agency… may, after providing \nreasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient… until the conditions are corrected.” Id. \nAnd in the event payments are withheld for noncompliance, they must be released “upon \nsubsequent compliance.” 2 CFR § 200.305(b)(7).  \n129.  Here, FEMA has not identiﬁed any federal statute or regulation that \nrequires withholding of SSP grant funds, has not identiﬁed a failure to comply with any grant \nterms or conditions, and did not provide notice, before grabbing back the funds.  \n130.  Instead, even taking the letter at face value, the stated reasons for \nwithholding funds are based on specious and unsubstantiated allegations unrelated to any grant \nterms or conditions. \n131.  (cid:3680)e “noncompliance” letter announces purported “Findings,” which are \nexpressed as no more than “concerns” and which are, in any event, facially pretextual.  \n132.  First, the letter states that DHS “has signiﬁcant concerns that SSP funding \nis going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities.” But it does not allege any \npurported illegal activities committed by any entity that might have been paid with funds for \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 38 of 64\nwhich the City obtained reimbursement. Instead, the letter alleges—citing and exaggerating the \nsame news reports that defendant Hamilton cited in his declaration a week earlier: \nAccording to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has \ntaken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of \noperations to plan a variety of crimes. According to these same reports, these \ncrimes include gun and drug sales as well as sex traﬃcking, which can \nreasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself. \n133.  (cid:3680)e letter asserts that “DHS/FEMA has a responsibility to ensure that it \ndoes not make payments that fund criminal activity.” But, the letter does not explain what \n“illegal activity” might be funded by the grant. As FEMA knows, the grant provides “ﬁnancial \nsupport to non-federal entities to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants \nfollowing their release from the Department of Homeland Security.” FEMA, Shelter and \nServices Program, https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program (last visited Feb. 13, \n2025). (cid:3680)e grant does not provide funds directly to any noncitizen migrants, nor to fund any \nactivities not speciﬁed within the grant terms.  \n134.  A further “ﬁnding” is FEMA’s purported “concern” that  \nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging \nor inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in \nviolation of law, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv); transporting or moving illegal \naliens, id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); harboring, concealing, or shielding from \ndetection illegal aliens, id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii); or applicable conspiracy, \naiding or abetting, or attempt liability respecting these statutes. \n135.  As FEMA knows, this is a patently false “concern” because the grants \nfund only those costs for shelter and services that are provided to individuals that DHS \ndetermined to release from its custody into the community. (cid:3680)at is, the individual was already in \nthe United States, in DHS custody, and then released by DHS to the community—facts that \nFEMA conﬁrmed for each individual before, and as a condition of, making payment. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 39 of 64\n136.  In re-framing as illegal “harboring” or “transporting” the provision of \nshelter and services to noncitizen migrants released by DHS into the U.S., the letter eﬀectively \nimposes new and grant-negating conditions by rendering grant compliance to be unlawful.  \n137.  (cid:3680)e “noncompliance” letter claims that “[b]ased on the concerns described \n. . . , DHS/FEMA will conduct additional monitoring and review of” the FY23 and FY24 SSP \nawards “as permitted by the terms and conditions of the award(s) to ensure compliance with all \nterms and conditions of [the] award(s).” (cid:3680)e letter reiterates that “[d]uring this time, payments \nunder the grant award(s) will be temporarily held. (cid:3680)is action includes the amount of funding . . \n. that DHS/FEMA recently clawed back.” (cid:3680)e “noncompliance” letter adds that “[u]pon the \nconclusion of that monitoring, FEMA will notify you of the results and any other remedies for \nnoncompliance or speciﬁc conditions, as appropriate.” \n138.  (cid:3680)e “noncompliance” letter makes a show of requesting information that \nwould somehow assist FEMA in making a ﬁnal determination. But the information requested is \nlargely information that FEMA not only possesses but has already reviewed in determining to \nmake payment to the City. (cid:3680)e letter seeks: \nAll documents regarding the aliens with whom your organization and your \nsubrecipients and contracts [sic] interacted with in carrying out the scope of \nyour SSP award, including their names and contact information; and a detailed \nand descriptive list of speciﬁc services provided, and proof of provision of \nthese services; or  \nA written statement that your organization has already submitted all of the \ninformation identiﬁed in No. 1, above, to DHS/FEMA.  \n139.  As described above, the City supplied the name and A-Number for \nindividuals for whom the City sought reimbursement, as well as proof of services rendered—all \nof which FEMA reviewed and approved for payment. Further, none of the information \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 40 of 64\nrequested is in any way related to the letter’s stated central “concern”: allegations of criminal \nactivity. It is a charade of a request for information. \n140.  By letter dated March 14, 2025, the City responded to FEMA’s \ninformation request, reserving all rights with respect to the issues it is raising in this litigation \nand in any appeal of the noncompliance letter itself.  \nH. Defendant Hamilton Doubles Down on Opposition to SSP and Demonstrates that \nthe Money Grab was Unjustiﬁed \n141.  On February 28, 2025, Acting Administrator Hamilton, in a declaration \nsubmitted in this action, ECF No. 17-1 (“Hamilton 2/28 Declaration”), asserts that “on its face, \nSSP funds sheltering and transportation of illegal aliens.” In so stating, Hamilton makes clear \nFEMA’s opposition to SSP itself.  \n142.  Hamilton further states that no funds should have been disbursed to the \nCity following the Noem Memo because the memo put “on hold” all disbursements that “touch \nin anyway on immigration” and “go to non-proﬁt organizations or for which non-proﬁts are \neligible.” ECF No. 17-1 ¶ 8-9. Hamilton’s reliance on the Noem Memo is telling: the Noem \nMemo uses the purpose of the SSP – providing services to non-citizens – as a basis to “pause” \nthe SSP. (cid:3680)e Noem Memo thus seeks to stop SSP because Defendants reject its purpose; the \nmoney grab and the pause have nothing to do with the City’s compliance, which FEMA itself \nhad previously determined when it paid the City on February 4, 2025.  \n143.  Furthermore, at the time of the money grab and the “noncompliance” \nletter, the Noem Memo, was enjoined as an across the board unilateral pause in funding, by the \nTRO in New York v. Trump. See supra. Signiﬁcantly, in his February 11 declaration ﬁled in the \nRhode Island case, Hamilton averred that the pause was imposed “as of [that] day,” not as of the \nissuance of the Noem Memo. \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 41 of 64\n144.  (cid:3680)e Hamilton 2/28 Declaration also states for the ﬁrst time – 24 days after \nthe $80 million SSP payment to the City and 17 days after the money grab – that the payment \nwas made “in error.” ECF No. 17.1 ¶ 9. (cid:3680)e allegation of a payment “error” appears to be an \nattempt to justify the money grab as a legitimate “reversal” of the ACH transfer to the City’s \naccount. However, Defendants did not make an “error” in paying the City; rather Defendants \ndecided they did not like the SSP program and tried to reclaim whatever monies they could \nwithout following agency procedures. (cid:3680)at is not a proper basis for an ACH reversal and is not a \nproper basis for taking back money after approving the reimbursement.  \n145.  Defendant Hamilton explains in his February 28 Declaration that the \nmoney grab was executed by certifying over the phone to the Department of the Treasury that \nthe SSP payment to the City was “improper” and by submitting to “Treasury an Improper \nRecovery Request via the Treasury Check Information System to recover the payment pursuant \nto 31 C.F.R. § 210.6(f).” ECF No. 17-1 ¶ 11. However, Section 210.6(f) does not permit a \nreversal of an ACH transfer for a change of mind about policy; it permits a reversal for a \n“duplicate or erroneous entry.”  \n146.  FEMA’s decision to pay the City over $80 million after a thorough review \nof the claims was not an “erroneous entry.” (cid:3680)e Code of Federal Regulations incorporates by \nreference the “ACH Rules,” deﬁned as the “2021 Operating Rules & Guidelines … published \nby Nacha,” (the National Automated Clearing House Association). 31 C.F.R. 210.2(a) (“Any \nterm that is not deﬁned in [31 C.F.R. Part 210] shall have the meaning set forth in the ACH \nRules”). Under the 2021 Nacha rules, an “erroneous entry” is deﬁned as “(a) a duplicate [of a \nprevious entry]…(b) a payment to or from a Receiver [who is not the] … Receiver … intended \n… by the Originator; (c) a payment in a dollar amount diﬀerent than was intended by the \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 42 of 64\nOriginator … ; or (d) [a] payment of a debit Entry on a date earlier” than intended by the \nOriginator or a “Credit Entry on a date later” than intended by the Originator. NACHA Rule \n§ 8.38. 8 None of the reasons Defendants have articulated for the money grab are an allowable \nbasis for an ACH reversal. \n147.  Hamilton’s statements moreover are inconsistent with earlier statements \nby various defendants, including DHS Secretary Noem’s February 12, 2025 X post, that make \nclear the real reason for the reversal was animus towards the program. As Secretary Noem \nstated, she “clawed back the full payment that deep state activists unilaterally gave to NYC \nmigrant hotels.” See supra.  \n148.  Defendant Hamilton’s factual assertions are also contradicted by the far-\nmore-speciﬁc recollection of Comans that, even after the reimbursement payments were made \non February 4, 2025, FEMA leadership and DOGE discussed and agreed that the Noem Memo \napplied only to nongovernmental organizations and did not stop payments to state and local \ngovernment grantees. Comans recalled that there was a policy change made later, some time \nafter February 5, 2025, to apply the Noem memo to stop payments to state and local \ngovernments and that this policy change lead to the money grab. (cid:3680)us, FEMA’s February 4, \n2025 wire transfer to the City was not in “error” at the time that it was made.  \n149.  (cid:3680)e Hamilton 2/28 Declaration repeats the vague assertions about possible \nillegal activity he articulated in the Hamilton 2/11 Declaration and in the “noncompliance” \n \n8 See also NACHA Rule 2.9.1 (allowing ACH reversals to “correct an Erroneous Entry \npreviously initiated” and requiring that the “Originator must make a reasonable attempt to notify \nthe Receiver of the Reversing Entry and the reason for the Reversing Entry no later than the \nSettlement Date of the Reversing Entry”); NACHA Rule 2.9.5 (clarifying that an ACH reversal \nis improper if initiated “for any reason other than” to correct an “erroneous entry”).  \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 43 of 64\nletter. He also further elaborates on Defendants purported “concern” that “entities receiving \npayments might be involved in illegal activity, seemingly specifying the “Roosevelt Hotel” as \nan “NGO” that may be receiving funds. ECF No. 17-1 ¶¶ 10, 12. But, Defendant Hamilton does \nnot identify any illegal activity by the hotel, only speculation that illegal activities might be \n“presumed” to have occurred there. Id. ¶ 6. And none of these vague allegations justify the \nmoney grab, after FEMA had reviewed the reimbursement request and approved and paid the \nreimbursement. \n150.  While Hamilton claims that the February 4, 2025 payment to the City was \nan “error” because of the pause eﬀectuated by the Noem Memo, that memo cannot form a \nlegitimate basis of authority for the money grab or for the suspension of SSP. (cid:3680)e Noem Memo \nviolates the APA, the separation of powers doctrine and the Spending Clause. To the extent the \nNoem Memo eﬀectuated an across-the-board “pause,” it violates the TRO in New York v. \nTrump. To the extent it is being interpreted as applying to payments to local governments, as \nwell as non-governmental organizations, that interpretation was not in eﬀect when the payment \nto the City was made and therefore cannot form the basis of any claim that the February 4 \npayment to the City was the result of an “error.” To the extent the Noem Memo is premised on \nthe concern of possible illegality in providing shelter and services to noncitizen migrants \nreleased into the United States by DHS, it improperly imposes new, grant-negating conditions. \nAnd ﬁnally, nothing set forth in the Noem Memo establishes grounds consistent with the Nacha \nrules concerning reversal of an “erroneous entry.”  \nI.  President Trump Announces Termination of SSP as “Waste” and “Scam ” and \nGloats Over the Money Grab Executed “Just in Time”  \n151.  On March 4, 2025, President Trump, delivered an address to Congress in \nwhich he touted, among other things, his Administration’s eﬀorts to “combat inﬂation” by \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 44 of 64\n“ending the ﬂagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.” President Trump enumerated a long list of so-\ncalled “appalling waste” “including “$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, \nreal estate developers done very well.”9 He then went on to call “all of these” programs he had \nidentiﬁed—including SSP—as “scams” that had “been found out and exposed and swiftly \nterminated.”  \n152.  Defendant Trump thus made clear that Defendants’ intent is to end SSP \nentirely, and not merely to review the City’s compliance with applicable terms and conditions, \nsaying “[w]e found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. And we’ve taken back the money \nand reduced our debt to ﬁght inﬂation and other things.”  \n153.  Defendant Trump then added: “Taking back a lot of that money, we got it \njust in time”— a seeming reference to the money grab, which was completed near close of \nbusiness on the last day for which an ACH reversal could be eﬀectuated under the ACH \nrules10— before insisting “[t]his is just the beginning.”  \nJ.  Defendants Continue to Eﬀectuate the Suspension of SSP  \n154.  On March 11, 2025, Defendants notiﬁed SSP recipients across the country \nthat their awards are being withheld.11  \n \n9 Transcript of President Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress, Associated \nPress, Mar. 5, 2025 10:05 am, https://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-congress-transcript-\n751b5891a3265ff1e5c1409c391fef7c.  \n10 See 31 C.F.R. 210.6(f) (“Reversal under this section shall comply with the time limitations set \nforth in the applicable ACH Rules”); NACHA Rule 2.9.1 (requiring reversals to be made “within \nﬁve Banking Days following the Settlement Date of the Erroneous Entry”). \n11Letter from FEMA to Pima County, Arizona (Mar. 11, 2025), \nhttps://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/f82f85f8-1974-47ab-83e7-ef0964fa56d8 ; Uriel J. \nGarcía, Alejandro Serrano & Berenice Garcia, FEMA wants the names and addresses of \nmigrants helped by Texas nonprofits and local governments that got federal grant money, Texas \n \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 45 of 64\n155.  These letters use substantially similar boilerplate language to that found in \nthe “noncompliance” letter that FEMA sent the City, stating, without identifying any facts or \nbasis, that DHS “has significant concerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged in or \nfacilitating illegal activities” and that DHS is concerned that  \nentities receiving payment under this program may be guilty of encouraging \nor inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in \nviolation of law, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv); transporting or moving illegal \naliens, id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); harboring, concealing, or shielding from \ndetection illegal aliens, id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii); or applicable conspiracy, \naiding or abetting, or attempt liability respecting these statutes. \nSee e.g. https://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/f82f85f8-1974-47ab-83e7-ef0964fa56d8.  \n156.  The letters purport to apply “specific conditions” to the recipient’s SSP \naward and go on to request the same information the “noncompliance” letter sought from the \nCity, namely “1. [a]ll documents regarding the aliens with whom your organization and your \nsubrecipients and contracts interacted with in carrying out the scope of your SSP award, \nincluding their names and contact information; and a detailed and descriptive list of speciﬁc \nservices provided, and proof of provision of these services; or … 2 A written statement that your \norganization has already submitted all of the information identiﬁed in No. 1, above.” Id.  \n157.  Defendant Hamilton reiterated that SSP is suspended in a March 14, 2025 \nDeclaration in New York v. Trump, stating that FEMA has “paused funding to the [SSP]” and \n \nTribune, Mar. 13, 2025, https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/13/texas-fema-federal-grants-\nimmigrants/; Elliott Wenzler, Trump administration threatens to rescind $32 million promised to \nDenver by FEMA for migrant shelter costs, Denver Post, Mar. 14, 2025, \nhttps://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/14/denver-fema-letter-migrants-shelters-money-trump-\nadministration/; FEMA Withholds SSP Program Payments to Migrant Shelters Pending Review, \nImmigration Policy Tracking Project, Mar. 11, 2025, \nhttps://immpolicytracking.org/policies/fema-announces-review-of-migrant-shelter-aid/#/tab-\npolicy-documents.  \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 46 of 64\nasserting that the pause is pursuant to the Noem Memo and for the reasons set forth in his \nFebruary 11, 2025 declaration. New York v. Trump, ECF No. 166-1 ¶ 3. As discussed above, the \nHamilton 2/11 Declaration, submitted hours after the money grab, disingenuously purported to \nseek leave from the New York v. Trump court to “withhold” SSP funds from the City pursuant to \ngrant terms and conditions.  \n158.  Defendant Hamilton also stated that SSP grants to the states of Colorado \nand Wisconsin are being withheld and “speciﬁc conditions” are being imposed on these grants \nbecause DHS has “signiﬁcant concerns that the SSP funding is going to entities engaged in or \nfacilitating illegal activities.” New York v. Trump, ECF No 166-1 ¶¶ 30-31.  \nK. FEMA is Bound by Extensive Rules and Procedures,  \nIncluding in the Grant Terms and Conditions \n159.  By grabbing back funding from the City, and suspending further funding \nunder SSP24 and SSP23, FEMA has acted contrary to the applicable rules and grant terms. \n(cid:3680)ere is nothing in the NOFOs, Award Letters, applicable regulations, or Nacha rules that \nallows Defendants to “recover” funds by taking them out of the City’s bank account before \ngoing through an administrative process that includes notice and an opportunity to object.  \n160.  Furthermore, Defendants’ supposed administrative determination to \nsuspend SSP24 and SSP23 funding is plainly pretextual, as it does not identify any legitimate \nbasis for withholding SSP funding – let alone for having taken back funds that were previously \napproved and paid. Instead, it makes specious allegations unrelated to the grant terms, asks for \nsubmission of information that City OMB already provided and that FEMA already reviewed in \ndetail, and fails to cite any grant term with which the City has not complied.  \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 47 of 64\nL.  (cid:3680)e Money Grab Violates Federal Rules and Grant Terms and Conditions \n161.  As described above, FEMA did not provide any notice to City OMB \nbefore the money grab.  \n162.  (cid:3680)e money grab was made in total disregard of the fact that FEMA \nawarded the grant and then reviewed, approved, and paid the reimbursement.  \n163.  No lawful grounds exist—and none have been asserted—for the money \ngrab, and no lawful procedure was followed. Instead, Defendants have made clear that their true \nintent is to halt the program entirely because they do not like it, and have commenced a post hoc \n“procedure” to give legal gloss to their unlawful determination and action. (cid:3680)e money grab must \nbe reversed and defendants prevented from engaging in unlawful money grabs in the future.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I \nSubstantive APA Violation: Illegal Money Grab \nArbitrary and Capricious; Abuses of Discretion \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n164.  (cid:3680)e City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n165.  Defendants include “agenc[ies]” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n166.  (cid:3680)e FEMA money grab is agency action subject to review under the APA. \n167.  (cid:3680)e APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nﬁndings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n168.  An agency action is arbitrary or capricious where it is not “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 48 of 64\nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (cleaned up).  \n169.  (cid:3680)e “reasoned explanation requirement of administrative law . . . is meant \nto ensure that agencies oﬀer genuine justiﬁcations for important decisions, reasons that can be \nscrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n785 (2019). Agencies may not rely on explanations that are “contrived” or “incongruent with \nwhat the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decision-making process.” Id.  \n170.  Moreover, “courts may not accept … counsel’s post hoc rationalizations \nfor agency action” or otherwise “supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency \nitself has not given.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 43, 50. Rather, “an agency’s action \nmust be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.” Id. \n171.  Here, Defendants provided the City no reason or basis at all for grabbing \n$80 million from the City’s bank account for costs FEMA has already conﬁrmed through review \nof extensive documentation were eligible for reimbursement under the SSP grants.  \n172.  (cid:3680)e money grab also separately violated the rules governing action by the \nfederal government to reverse ACH transactions, as incorporated in and modiﬁed by 31 C.F.R. \nPart 210. \n173.  To the extent FEMA oﬃcials and other federal oﬃcials oﬀered rationales \nfor the money grab on social media, in public statements, and in lawsuits to which the City is \nnot a party, these rationales are unsupported by fact or law, and oﬀer no legitimate basis for \nFEMA’s action.  \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 49 of 64\n174.  To the extent the “noncompliance” letter purports to oﬀer rationales for the \nmoney grab, it does not add anything, is pretextual, unsupported, and oﬀer no legitimate basis \nfor FEMA’s action.  \n175.  An action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency “failed to consider . \n. . important aspects of the problem” before it. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCalifornia, 591 U.S. 1, 25 (2020) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43). Here, \nDefendants demonstrated no consideration of the City’s substantial reliance interests in \nreceiving funds to reimburse the City for monies already spent housing and providing services \nto non-citizen migrants in compliance with the grant terms and requirements. Where, as here, \n“an agency changes course ... it must ‘be cognizant that longstanding policies may have \nengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”’ Id. (quoting Encino \nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016)); see also Perez v.

(cid:3680)e suspension or pause of SSP and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 \nfunding are agency action subject to review under the APA. \n181.  Defendants have not oﬀered any lawful basis for suspending or pausing \nSSP or withholding the SSP24 and SSP23 grants. Defendants have not identiﬁed any costs that \nare not reimbursable under the SSP grants. \n182.  Defendants have not provided any reason – other than the improper \nrationale of animus to SSP itself – for pausing, suspending, and/or terminating SSP. Defendants \npurported reasons for suspending or pausing SSP or withholding the SSP24 and SSP23 grants \nare inconsistent with and directly contrary to the statutory text of the DHS Appropriations Act \nand the stated goals of the SSP, which include providing funds to local governments that \nprovide food, shelter and other services for migrants recently released by DHS into the \ncommunity, in order to facilitate the safe, orderly, and humane release of noncitizen migrants \nfrom DHS short-term holding facilities.  \n183.

(cid:3680)e FEMA money grab is agency action subject to review under the APA. \n189.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nﬁndings, and conclusions found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity,” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(B) – (C). \n190.  Neither the President nor an agency can take any action that exceeds the \nscope of their constitutional and/or statutory authority. \n191.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal \nmight otherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their \noﬃces.” Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (quoting U.S. v. \nMorton Salt, 338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950)). Moreover, “Section 706 makes clear that agency \ninterpretations of statutes—like agency interpretations of the Constitution—are not entitled to \ndeference.” Id. at 392 (emphasis in original). Rather, it “remains the responsibility of the court \nto decide whether the law means what the agency says.” Id. (quoting Perez v.

Defendants cannot unilaterally grab back or refuse to disburse funds appropriated by \nCongress contrary to congressional intent and directive. \n193.  Moreover, the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the Executive to \nmake appropriated funds “available for obligation,” subject to only two exceptions: rescissions \nand deferrals. 2 U.S.C. §§ 683-84. Deferrals may not be made for policy reasons, and \nrescissions are subject to congressional approval. Id. § 684(b).  \n194.  (cid:3680)e FEMA money grab is neither a lawful rescission nor a lawful deferral \nunder the Impoundment Control Act. It is not a lawful rescission because lawful rescissions are \nsubject to congressional approval, id. § 684(b) and the President has not sought congressional \napproval. It is not a lawful deferral because Defendants made clear that the FEMA money grab \nwas motivated by a policy disagreement with the SSP. As the D.C. Circuit has explained, the \nExecutive lacks the statutory authority to engage in policy-based deferrals that would “negate \nthe will of Congress.” City of New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 901 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \n195.

Defendants cannot unilaterally grab back or refuse to disburse funds appropriated by \nCongress contrary to congressional intent and directive. \n203.  Moreover, the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the Executive to \nmake appropriated funds “available for obligation,” subject to only two exceptions: rescissions \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 55 of 64\nand deferrals. 2 U.S.C. §§ 683-84. Deferrals may not be made for policy reasons, and \nrescissions are subject to congressional approval. Id. § 684(b). \n204.  FEMA’s suspension or pause of SSP and withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 \nfunding is neither a lawful rescission nor a lawful deferral under the Impoundment Control Act. \nIt is not a lawful rescission because lawful rescissions are subject to congressional approval, and \nthe President has not sought congressional approval. It is not a lawful deferral because \nDefendants made clear that it was motivated by their hostility to the stated purpose of the \ncongressional appropriation and their determination not to make SSP payments. \n205.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to a \ndeclaration that FEMA’s suspension or pause of SSP and withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 \nfunding violates the APA because it is contrary to law, ultra vires, and in excess of statutory \nauthority. \n206.  In addition, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to additional appropriate relief under 5 \nU.S.C. § 705 enjoining Defendants from pausing or suspending SSP or implementing the \nwithholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds. \nCount V \nProcedural APA Violations: Illegal Money Grab & Illegal Pause/Suspension of SSP and \nWithholding of Funds Without Observance of Procedure Required by Law \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n207.  (cid:3680)e City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n208.  Defendants include “agenc[ies]” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n209.  (cid:3680)e FEMA money grab is agency action subject to review under the APA.  \n210.  FEMA’s pause or suspension of SSP and withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 \nfunding are agency action subject to review under the APA. \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 56 of 64\n211.  Under the APA, a court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, ﬁndings and conclusions found to be . . . without observance of procedure required by \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n212.  Neither the DHS Appropriations Act, the SSP grant Award Letters, the \nNOFOs nor the Code of Federal Regulations, incorporated into the SSP grant documents, permit \nDefendants to grab back funds duly disbursed by FEMA to the City pursuant to and in \naccordance with the SSP grants’ terms and conditions. Nor do they allow Defendants to pause or \nsuspend SSP or withhold payment of funds that were approved pursuant to and in accordance \nwith the SSP grants’ terms and conditions. \n213.  In eﬀectuating the money grab, the suspension or pause of SSP and the \nwithholding of funding, Defendants failed to follow the procedures available under the SSP \nGrant Award Letters, the NOFOs and the Code of Federal Regulations, incorporated into the \ngrant documents.  \n214.  Prior to grabbing back $80 million, Defendants did not provide the City \nwith notice of any agency determination of non-compliance, any speciﬁc conditions to be \napplied to the City SSP grants, nor any grant suspension, pause or termination. 2 C.F.R. \n§§ 200.208, 200.243; 200.305; 200.339 – 200.342. Nor did FEMA oﬀer the City any \nopportunity to contest any agency determinations before taking the money. Id. § 200.342. \n215.  FEMA represented to the Rhode Island District Court as of February 11, \n2025 that FEMA was already “in the process of requesting information from New York City to \nfurther investigate this matter” and would “provide[] notice” to the City and “provide the \ninformation and process required by regulation and the terms and conditions of the award.” \nHamilton Declaration at ¶¶ 12, 13. But at the time of their ﬁling, FEMA had already grabbed the \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 57 of 64\n$80 million from New York City without providing notice, without requesting any information, \nwithout announcing any ﬁndings, and without following any required process.  \n216.  Defendants’ February 18, 2025 “noncompliance” letter did not identify \nany noncompliance by the City. Indeed, FEMA issued the letter, purporting to impose on the \nCity “speciﬁc conditions” and withholding of funding, before conducting a compliance review \nand then appeared to collapse multiple steps in the administrative process. It carried out this \nmisuse of administrative procedures without giving the City the opportunity to object and \npresent its own information before implementing the speciﬁc conditions, the pause or \nsuspension of SSP and the withholding of funds. 2 CFR 200.305(b)(6), 200.305(b)(7), 200.342.  \n217.  Moreover FEMA’s “concerns” are facially pretextual and unsupported. \n(cid:3680)e “noncompliance” letter requests information that is not related to the asserted concerns and \nseeks information that, for the most part, has already been provided by the City, reviewed by \nFEMA, and determined to be suﬃcient for payment. (cid:3680)is pretextual ”noncompliance” letter \ndoes not provide the City with the procedural protections to which it is entitled.  \n218.  Further, the letter creates the impression of a City-speciﬁc compliance \nreview when, in fact, Defendants have determined to suspend or pause SSP due to antipathy \ntowards the program itself and with the intent to terminate SSP for that reason, whether as to the \nCity or program-wide. \n219.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the FEMA money grab, the pausing or suspending of SSP and the withholding \nof SSP24 and SSP23 funding violates the APA because it is without observance of procedure \nrequired by law. \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 58 of 64\n220.  In addition, Plaintiff is entitled to additional appropriate relief under 5 \nU.S.C. § 705 ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMA money grab by returning the $80 \nmillion to the City’s bank account, and enjoining Defendants from pausing or suspending SSP \nand implementing the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds. \n.Count VI \nViolation of Due Process \n(Against All Defendants) \n221.  (cid:3680)e City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n222.  Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, the government may not deprive a person or entity of a protected property \ninterest without due process of law. \n223.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal oﬃcials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \nInc., 575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015).  \n224.  (cid:3680)e City has a protected property interest in the $80 million that \nDefendants grabbed back from the City’s bank account and in the SSP23 funds it has been \nawarded and which have been disbursed to the City.  \n225.  Defendants’ conduct in implementing the FEMA money grab deprived the \nCity of its property interest without providing notice or a pre-deprivation opportunity to be \nheard.  \n226.  While a post-deprivation opportunity to be heard would not be suﬃcient \nunder the circumstances, Defendants have not in fact provided a genuine post-deprivation \nopportunity to be heard because the process being oﬀered is pretextual and illusory. For \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 59 of 64\nexample, while the “noncompliance” letter requests more information, that information is \nlargely identical to the information that FEMA already reviewed and approved in connection \nwith approving disbursements to the City for the SSP24 and SSP23 grants. Additionally, the \ninformation requested does not speak to the purported “concerns” articulated in the letter. As is \nclear from Defendants’ statements and actions, they have determined to suspend and terminate \nSSP and not make SSP payments and are using the noncompliance letter (and similar letters to \nother grant recipients) to accomplish that aim.  \n227.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to a declaration that the \nFEMA money grab, the pausing or suspending of SSP, and the withholding of SSP24 and \nSSP23 funding are contrary to law. \n228.  In addition, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to additional appropriate relief including \n(1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMA money grab by returning the $80 million to the \nCity’s bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City \nbank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining \nDefendants from suspending or pausing SSP or implementing the withholding of SSP24 and \nSSP23 funds.  \nCount VII \nSeparation of Powers \n(Against All Defendants) \n229.  (cid:3680)e City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n230.  Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution enumerates that: \n“[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which \nshall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 1.  \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 60 of 64\n231.  “As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that ‘important subjects . . . \nmust be entirely regulated by the legislature itself,’ even if Congress may leave the Executive \n‘to act under such general provisions to ﬁll up the details.’” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n737 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42-43, 6 L.Ed. \n253 (1825)).  \n232.  (cid:3680)e separation of powers doctrine thus represents perhaps the central tenet \nof our constitution. See, e.g., Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 637-38 (2024); West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. at 723-24. Consistent with these principles, the executive acts at the \nlowest ebb of his constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary to the express or \nimplied will of Congress. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) \n(Jackson, J., concurring).  \n233.  FEMA’s money grab, suspension and apparent termination of SSP, and \nwithholding of SSP24 and SSP23 funds violates the separation of powers because the executive \nbranch has overridden the careful judgments of Congress by acting without legitimate basis or \njustiﬁcation in taking back funding and withholding funding, and suspending programs without \nlegitimate basis or justiﬁcation, that were speciﬁcally authorized and appropriated under the \nDHS Appropriations Act and was used by the City for the purposes set forth in that Act. Indeed, \nFEMA oﬃcials have acknowledged that they are refusing and will continue to refuse to \neﬀectuate the DHS Appropriations Act, thus acting contrary to law.  \n234.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to a declaration that the \nFEMA money grab, the pausing or suspending of SSP and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 \nfunding are contrary to law. \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 61 of 64\n235.  In addition, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to additional appropriate relief including \n(1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMA money grab by returning the $80 million to the \nCity’s bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City \nbank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining \nDefendants from suspending or pausing SSP or implementing the withholding of SSP24 and \nSSP23 funds.  \nCount VIII \nSpending Clause \n(Against All Defendants) \n236.  (cid:3680)e City repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n237.  (cid:3680)e Spending Clause provides that Congress—not the Executive—“shall \nhave Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide \nfor the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .” U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. \n8, clause 1. \n238.  “Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power is broad,” but \nconditions on funding must be “unambiguous[]” and they cannot “surprise[] participating States \n[or localities] with post acceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 25 (1981). States and localities must have fair notice of conditions, \nand once funds have been accepted pursuant to a federal spending program, the Federal \ngovernment cannot alter the conditions attached to those funds so signiﬁcantly as to \n“accomplish[ ] a shift in kind, not merely degree.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 583-84 (2012).  \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 62 of 64\n239.  Furthermore, conditions must be “reasonably related to the purpose of the \nexpenditure.” New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 172 (1992) (citing Mass. v. United \nStates, 435 U.S. 444 (1978)).  \n240.  FEMA’s money grab, suspension of SSP, and withholding violate the \nSpending Clause because the executive branch has overridden the careful judgments of \nCongress by imposing purported new conditions and requirements on SSP funding that are \ninconsistent with the DHS Appropriations Act, the SSP Award Letters, the NOFOs and the Code \nof Federal Regulations as incorporated by reference into the SSP grant documents.  \n241.  Defendants have made clear their animus towards and intent to thwart and \nterminate SSP. (cid:3680)e concerns Defendants put forth as rationales for compliance review impose \nnew terms and conditions that are eﬀectively grant-negating inasmuch as they describe as \nunlawful the exact acts that the grant funds the city to do: provide shelter and services to \nnoncitizen migrants released into the United States by DHS. .  \n242.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to a declaration that the \nmoney grab, the pausing or suspension of SSP, and the withholding of SSP24 and SSP23 \nfunding are contrary to law. \n243.  In addition, Plaintiﬀ is entitled to additional appropriate relief including \n(1) ordering Defendants to reverse the FEMA money grab by returning the $80 million to the \nCity’s bank account; (2) enjoining Defendants from taking any further money from any City \nbank account in connection with the SSP24 and SSP23 FEMA grants; and (3) enjoining \nDefendants from suspending or pausing SSP or implementing the withholding of SSP24 and \nSSP23 funds.  \n61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 63 of 64\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the City demands judgment against Defendants: \n(a) Declaring unlawful and setting aside the SSP24 $80 million money grab as \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); as contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); as in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(C); and without observance of procedure required by law under 5 U.S.C \n§ 706(2)(D) and a violation of the Due Process Clause, the separation of powers, \nand the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution;  \n(b) Declaring unlawful and setting aside the SSP24 $80 million money grab as \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); as violating the law governing ACH transfers \nand reversals.  \n(c) Issuing a permanent injunction ordering Defendants to ordering Defendants to \nreturn the SSP24 $80 million money grab funds to the City’s bank account; \nreverse the SSP24 $80 million money grab by returning the $80 million to the \nCity’s bank account;  \n(d) Declaring unlawful and setting aside, and enjoining Defendants’ suspension or \npause of SSP and the February 18, 2025 FEMA Remedy for Noncompliance \nLetter withholding funding as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); as contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); as \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 44     Filed 03/20/25     Page 64 of 64\nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); and without observance of procedure required \nby law under 5 U.S.C § 706(2)(D) and a violation of the Due Process Clause, the \nseparation of powers, and the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution; \n(e) Awarding Plaintiﬀ its costs and attorneys’ fees in this action, and other \ndisbursements as appropriate; and \n(f) Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \nDated:  New York, New York \nMarch 20, 2025 \nMURIEL GOODE-TRUFANT  \nCorporation Counsel of  \n the City of New York \nAttorney for Plaintiﬀ The City of New York  \n100 Church Street  \nNew York, NY 10007 \n(212) 356-1000 \n \n \nBy:   s/Doris Bernhardt     \nJoshua Rubin \nDoris Bernhardt \nMelanie Ash \nJune R.

The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency (FEMA) issued grants to Plaintiff under the Shelter and Services Program (SSP).  The \ngrants were subject to various conditions contained in FEMA’s solicitations and awards.  \nPursuant to the agreements with Plaintiff, FEMA has held approximately $80 million by \nreversing a reimbursement payment until Plaintiff could provide additional information to assess \nPlaintiff’s request for funds.  FEMA later decided to terminate Plaintiff’s grant agreements, such \nthat no new expenses could be incurred under them, due to a change in agency priorities. \nIn response, Plaintiff brought this action seeking injunctive relief requiring FEMA to (1) \ndeposit the disputed $80 million in Plaintiff’s bank account, and (2) reinstate the terminated \nagreements.  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC), ECF No. 51, invokes the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution as ostensible bases for a claimed right \nto continue to access millions of dollars in terminated grants.  But Plaintiff’s claims for relief are \nentirely dependent on its assertion that the grant agreements provide a right to continued funding, \nand that the government’s withholding of $80 million and later termination of the grants \nbreached those agreements.  In short, this case is a run-of-the mill contract dispute over money. \nPlaintiff’s APA claims challenging the withholding of $80 million and termination of the \ngrant agreements are, in essence, contract-based claims for monetary relief against the federal \ngovernment over which this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court’s recent \ndecision in Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. ---, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per \ncuriam) is controlling.  In a case challenging the government’s termination of federal grants, the \nCourt held that “the Government [was] likely to succeed in showing [that] the District Court \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 11 of 36\nlacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” because the Tucker Act vests \nexclusive jurisdiction over such actions in the Court of Federal Claims.  Id. at 968.  Further, \nDefendants’ discretionary decisions regarding the funds constitute unreviewable agency action, \nare not ripe, and do not violate the law.  Plaintiff’s constitutional claims fare no better, as they \nfail for various reasons.  This Court should therefore grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss the \nSAC pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). \nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  Plaintiff’s Grant Awards Under the Shelter and Services Program \n \nIn 2023 and 2024, Congress appropriated funds to the Department of Homeland  \nSecurity (DHS) to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities, in \nsupport of relieving overcrowding in short-term holding facilities of the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection.  SAC ¶¶ 41-42; Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. \nNo. 117-328, div. F (DHS FY23 Appropriations Act), 136 Stat. 4459, 4725, 4730 (2022); Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec. Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, div. C (DHS FY24 \nAppropriations Act), 138 Stat. 460, 593, 598.  Congress made funds available for costs of \nshelter and eligible services to noncitizen migrants within 45 days of their release from DHS \ncustody.  SAC ¶¶ 44, 48.  DHS’s efforts are to secure the United States’ borders, id. ¶ 190, and \nthe grants were one way to safely, orderly, and humanely treat noncitizen migrants.  Id. ¶ 244. \nFEMA, through these grants, provided assistance to the grantees for certain services, \nand that agreement was memorialized through Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) and \naward letters.  Id. ¶¶ 45, 54, 64, 68, 70-71.1  Like most federal grants, these grants were subject \n \n1 The NOFOs and award letters are appended as Defendants’ Exhibits (DE), and are identical to \nthe ones included in ECF 9: DE 1, FY23 NOFO and awards; DE 2, FY24 SSP-Allocated (SSP-\nA) and awards; and DE 3, FY24 SSP-Competitive (SSP-C) and award. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 12 of 36\nto the recipient’s acceptance of certain terms and conditions.  Id. ¶ 67.  Applicants “must \ncomply with applicable statutes, rules and regulations, and policies, this NOFO, and the terms \nand conditions of the federal award. They must also comply with the Uniform Administrative \nRequirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements at 2 C.F.R. Part 200.’”  Id. (quoting \nSSP-A NOFO at 30, SSP-C NOFO at 21).  The grants were subject to DHS Standard Terms and \nConditions, and applicable laws, including 8 U.S.C. § 1324.  Id. ¶¶ 67, 148. \nPlaintiff applied for and received funding for both fiscal years 2023 and 2024.  Id. ¶¶ 45, \n68, 70-71.  For 2023, FEMA awarded Plaintiff $106.9 million and paid $70.6 million for \nallowable reimbursement costs.  Id. ¶ 43.  For 2024. FEMA awarded Plaintiff approximately \n$81.4 million through a series of three grant awards.  Id. ¶¶ 70-71.  Both the 2023 and 2024 \nawards incorporated the terms of the NOFOs through which Plaintiff applied and reaffirmed the \nrequirement that Plaintiff comply with federal grant regulations, 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  Id. ¶ 72. \nII.  FEMA’s Withholding of $80 Million in Reimbursement Funds \n \nOn January 28, 2025, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a directive addressing \nthe agency’s spending by placing “on hold pending review” all grant disbursements for which \n“non-profit organizations are eligible” and “touch in any way on immigration.”  Id. ¶ 90.  \nNotwithstanding the above, on February 4, 2025, FEMA made two reimbursement \npayments to Plaintiff under the 2024 grant agreement totaling approximately $80 million.  Id. ¶ \n82.  FEMA stated these payments were made “in error.”  Id. ¶ 161 (quoting Decl. of Cameron \nHamilton ¶ 9, ECF No. 17-1, Ex. A to Defs.’ Mem. of L. in Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for PI and \nTRO, ECF No. 17).  To address the error, FEMA contacted the Department of Treasury and \nafter certifying over the phone that the payment was improper, FEMA submitted to “Treasury \nan Improper Recovery Request via the Treasury Check Information System to recover the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 13 of 36\npayment pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 210.6(f).”  Id. ¶ 162 (quoting Hamilton Decl. ¶ 11).  Treasury \nwithheld the funds from Plaintiff’s account and returned the payment to FEMA.  Id. ¶ 110. \nOn February 18, 2025, FEMA issued a “Remedy for Noncompliance Letter” regarding \nNew York’s SSP awards for both fiscal years 2023 and 2024.  Id. ¶¶ 136-37; DE 4, Letter re: \nRemedy for Noncompliance Letter, Shelter and Services Program (SSP) (Feb. 18, 2025).  The \nletter notified Plaintiff that FEMA would be “temporarily withholding payments” for its prior \ngrant awards, that it had already recovered the payments totaling approximately $80 million, \nand that going forward it would also be instituting “specific conditions” on the grant award \npursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.208.  Id. ¶¶ 137-38.  FEMA based these actions on “significant \nconcerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities,” \nproviding the example of a hotel and SSP facility in New York City that is reportedly being \nused as a “recruiting center and base of operations” for a gang to “plan a variety of crimes,” \nincluding some that can “reasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself.”  Id. ¶ 146.  \nFEMA further stated its concern that entities receiving payments pursuant to New York’s SSP \nprogram may be violating immigration laws, citing 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A) and applicable \nconspiracy, aiding or abetting, and attempt prohibitions.  Id. ¶ 148.  To ensure compliance while \ntemporarily withholding funds, FEMA stated that it would conduct additional monitoring and \nreview of Plaintiff’s award.  Id. ¶ 151.  The letter also requested that Plaintiff submit \ninformation regarding the aliens serviced through the SSP award.  Id. ¶ 152.  On March 14, \n2025, Plaintiff responded to the request.  Id. ¶ 154. \nIII.  FEMA’s Termination of Plaintiff’s SSP Grant Awards \n \nOn April 1, 2024, FEMA sent Plaintiff a letter terminating each of Plaintiff’s SSP \nawards, effective immediately.  Id. ¶ 188; DE 5, Letter re: Termination Notice: Shelter and \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 14 of 36\nServices Program Grant Award (Apr. 1, 2025).  The letter stated that the termination was \nbecause the grants “‘no longer effectuate [] the program goals or agency priorities.’”  Id. ¶ 189 \n(brackets in original) (quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2)).  The letter further stated that \n“consistent with President Trump’s direction, [DHS] is focused on advancing the \nessential mission of enforcing immigration laws and securing the border.  Consequently, \ngrant programs that support, or have the potential to support, illegal immigration through \nfunding illegal activities or support for illegal aliens that is not consistent with DHS’s \nenforcement focus do not effectuate the agency’s current priorities.” \n  \nId. ¶ 190.  “The Termination Letter asserted that FEMA took this action ‘pursuant to the terms \nand conditions of the grant awards,’ which were defined to include the applicable NOFOs and 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2).”  Id. ¶ 189. \nIV.  Procedural History \n \nOn February 21, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit, ECF No. 1, and moved for both a \ntemporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction (PI).  ECF No. 5.  On March 5, \n2025, the Court denied the TRO.  ECF No. 42.  In response, Plaintiff withdrew its request for a \nPI, and the Court terminated Plaintiff’s motion.  ECF No. 40. \nOn June 13, 2025, Plaintiff filed the SAC, which, based on the APA and Constitution, \nchallenges FEMA’s withholding of the $80 million reimbursement and grant terminations.2  \nPlaintiff alleges that these actions are arbitrary and capricious (Counts 1-2), in excess of \nstatutory authority (Counts 3-4), and procedurally deficient (Count 5).  Plaintiff also asserts \nviolations of the Due Process Clause, Separation of Powers, and Spending Clause (Counts 6-8).  \nPlaintiff seeks an order returning “$80 million to the City’s bank account” and prohibiting \n \n2 The SAC characterizes these two actions in various confusing and overlapping ways, such as \nthe “Money Grab”, the “Zero Out”, the “Withholding of SSP Funds”, the “Illegal \nPause/Suspension”, and “Termination of SSP.”  Distilled to its essence, however, the SAC seeks \nan order “returning the $80 million to the City’s bank account” and an injunction prohibiting \nFEMA from “terminating the City’s SSP awards.”  SAC ¶ 291. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 15 of 36\nFEMA from “terminating the City’s SSP awards.”  SAC ¶¶ 239, 273 291. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \nI.  In General \n \n  On a motion to dismiss, a court “accept[s] as true” “all well-pleaded factual allegations” \nand draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party but does not consider \n“conclusory allegations or legal conclusions couched as factual allegations.”  Dixon v. von \nBlanckensee, 994 F.3d 95, 101 (2d Cir. 2021) (citations omitted).  The Court may consider both \n“the facts and allegations … contained in the complaint and in any documents that are either \nincorporated into the complaint by reference or attached to the complaint as exhibits.”  Blue Tree \nHotels Inv. (Can.), Ltd. v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 369 F.3d 212, 217 (2d Cir. \n2004); see Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152-53 (2d Cir. 2002). \n“Where a document is not incorporated by reference, the court may never[the]less \nconsider it where the complaint relies heavily upon its terms and effect, thereby rendering the \ndocument integral to the complaint.”  United States ex rel. Foreman v. AECOM, 19 F.4th 85, 106 \n(2d Cir. 2021) (quoting DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., 622 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010)).  \nII.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \n \n  A defendant may move to dismiss a claim for “lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  “A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \nRule 12(b)(1) when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.”  \nMakarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(1) \nmotion, the Court “‘must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint’ and \nshould refrain from drawing argumentative inferences in favor of the party contesting \njurisdiction.”  Dickerson v. Mut. of Am., 703 F. Supp. 2d 283, 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting Atl. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 16 of 36\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Balfour Maclaine Int’l Ltd., 968 F.2d 196, 198 (2d Cir. 1992)).  “[T]he burden of \nestablishing” that a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction always “rests upon the party \nasserting jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).  \nIII.  Federal Rule for Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \n \nA defendant may move to dismiss a claim for “failure to state a clam upon which relief \ncan be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a \ncomplaint must include “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that \nis plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842, \n854 (2d Cir. 2021).  Plaintiff “must provide the grounds upon which [Plaintiff’s] claim rests \nthrough factual allegations sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Rich \nv. Fox News Network, LLC, 939 F.3d 112, 121 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting Gallop v. Cheney, 642 \nF.3d 364, 368 (2d Cir. 2011)).  Thus, “even if the complaint contains sufficiently ‘well-pleaded’ \nallegations, ‘only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to \ndismiss.’”  Gallop, 642 F.3d at 368 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679).  “[W]here the well-pleaded \nfacts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint \nhas alleged — but it has not ‘show[n]’ — ‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’’’  Pension Benefit \nGuar. Corp. ex rel. St. Vincent Catholic Med. Ctrs. Ret. Plan v. Morgan Stanley Inv. Mgmt. Inc., \n712 F.3d 705, 718 (2d Cir. 2013) (alterations in original) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Under the APA to Compel the Government to Pay \nMoney Under a Contract \n \nPlaintiff’s APA claims (Counts 1-5) should be dismissed at the threshold because, as the \nSupreme Court recently confirmed, this Court lacks jurisdiction under the APA “to enforce a \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 17 of 36\ncontractual obligation to pay money” against the federal government.  Dep’t of Education, 145 \nS. Ct. at 968 (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212 \n(2002)).  And there is no question here that the relief Plaintiff seeks is for the government to \nkeep paying money under the terms of the agreements.  See e.g., SAC ¶ 239 (“order[] \nDefendants to … return[] the $80 million to the City’s bank account”), ¶ 291 (enjoin \n“withholding of the SSP24 and SSP23 funds” and “terminating the City’s SSP awards”). \n“In any suit in which the United States is a defendant, there must be a cause of action, \nsubject matter jurisdiction, and a waiver of sovereign immunity. . . .  A showing of jurisdiction is \nnot alone sufficient to allow the instant suit to proceed-there must also be a showing of specific \nwaiver of sovereign immunity.”  Presidential Gardens Assocs. v. United States ex. rel. Sec’y of \nHous. & Urb. Dev., 175 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 1999) (single dash in original).  The APA provides \na limited waiver of sovereign immunity for claims against the United States “seeking relief other \nthan money damages” for persons “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 702.  “The APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply ‘if any other statute that grants \nconsent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.’”  Dep’t of Education, \n145 S. Ct. at 968.  This “important carveout” to the APA’s immunity waiver “prevents plaintiffs \nfrom exploiting” that waiver “to evade limitations on suit contained in other statutes.”  Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 215 (2012).  \nPlaintiff’s attempt to use the APA to compel the government to pay money under the terms of the \nrelevant grant agreements is “impliedly forbid[den],” 5 U.S.C. § 702, by the Tucker Act. \n  The Tucker Act provides in relevant part that “[t]he United States Court of Federal \nClaims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States \nfounded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 18 of 36\n1491(a)(1).  “The Tucker Act impliedly forbids relief other than remedies provided by the Court \nof Federal Claims for actions that arise out of a contract with the United States.”  Up State Fed. \nCredit Union v. Walker, 198 F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up and citation omitted).  \nRegardless of how a claim is styled, the court lacks jurisdiction if it “is in ‘its essence’ \ncontractual.”  Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 603 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting \nMegapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). \n“The courts have established firmly that where the prime objective of the plaintiff is to \nobtain money from the Government, the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims under § \n1491(a)(1) could not be avoided by framing a complaint to appear to seek only \ninjunctive, mandatory or declaratory relief against government officials when the result \nwould be the equivalent of obtaining of money damages.” \n \nB.K. Instrument, Inc. v. United States, 715 F.2d 713, 727 (2d Cir. 1983). \nTo begin with, a grant upon conditions, and the acceptance of that grant by the recipient, \nconstitutes a contract.  See McGee vs. Mathis, 71 U.S. 143, 155 (1866) (“It is not doubted that \nthe grant by the United States to the State upon conditions [for swamp and overflowed \ngovernment lands], and the acceptance of the grant by the State, constituted a contract. All the \nelements of a contract met in the transaction,-competent parties, proper subject-matter, \nsufficient consideration, and consent of minds.”).  In accepting those federal funds, Plaintiff \nagreed to abide by the grant’s conditions.  See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981) (“legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of \na contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed \nconditions.”).  And the federal government received something of value — Plaintiff  agreed to \nhouse aliens whom DHS would otherwise detain under the immigration laws, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b), allowing DHS to more efficiently use its limited resources to satisfy its obligations \nunder the immigration laws.  See Vera Inst. of Just. v. Dep’t of Just., No. 25-CV-1643 (APM), \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 19 of 36\n2025 WL 1865160, at *10 (D.D.C. July 7, 2025) (concluding Justice grants are contracts \nsubject to the Tucker Act based on Federal Circuit precedent), appeal filed, No. 25-5248 (D.C. \nCir. July 10, 2025). \nFurther, “[w]hether a claim is in essence a contract claim over which the Court of \nFederal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction depends on a two-pronged analysis: a court must \nexamine both ‘the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases [its] claims, and . . . the \ntype of relief sought.”’  Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398, 406 (2d Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Up State, 198 F.3d at 375 (quoting Megapulse, Inc., 672 F.2d at 968)). \nFor the “source of the rights” prong, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that a \nplaintiff may disguise the claim as not sounding in contract and instead ensures “the right the \nplaintiff seeks to vindicate ‘stems from [an] independent, non-contractual source.’” Cohen v. \nPostal Holdings, LLC, 873 F.3d 394, 403 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Up State, 198 F. 3d at 376). \nThe second prong considers the type of relief sought.  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.  \n“Actions seeking specific performance of a contract, brought in order to avoid the Tucker Act’s \nlimitation on money judgments, are not allowed to be brought against the United States.”  \nPresidential Gardens, 175 F.3d at 143; cf. Great-West, 534 U.S. at 211 n.1 (“[A]ny claim for \nlegal relief can, with lawyerly inventiveness, be phrased in terms of an injunction.”). \nApplying the two-pronged test confirms that Plaintiff’s APA claims (Counts 1-5) \namount to the sort of contractual claims for monetary relief against the federal government over \nwhich this Court lacks jurisdiction.  Plaintiff’s claims are premised on contractual grant \nagreements, challenge the government’s exercise of a right to withhold funds according to the \nagreement’s terms, and seek to order the government to pay money pursuant to the terms.  Such \nclaims must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 20 of 36\nStarting with the source of the rights, Plaintiff asserts Defendants’ lack of basis to \nwithhold the $80 million in reimbursement funds because Plaintiff was “eligible for \nreimbursement under the SSP grants.”  SAC ¶ 232.  Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants \nlack a legal basis to hold funding because “Defendants have not identified any costs that are not \nreimbursable under the SSP grants and have not identified any proper grounds to suspend or \nterminate SSP or to withhold or deny payment.”  SAC ¶ 243.  Moreover, for Count 5, Plaintiff  \nfocused almost exclusively on the grant itself: \n“Neither the DHS Appropriations Act, the SSP grant Award Letters, the NOFOs nor the \nCode of Federal Regulations, incorporated into the SSP grant documents, permit \nDefendants to grab back funds duly disbursed by FEMA to the City pursuant to and in \naccordance with the SSP grants' terms and conditions. Nor do they allow Defendants to \npause or suspend SSP or withhold payment of funds that were approved pursuant to and \nin accordance with the SSP grants' terms and conditions.” \n \nSAC ¶ 280.   \nPlaintiff has no colorable claim to any funding absent the grant agreements.  Neither the \nappropriations acts authorizing the grant funding, the APA, or the Constitution confers any \nsubstantive right on Plaintiff to receive government funding.  And deciding whether FEMA \nlawfully withheld funds “turns entirely on the terms of” the grant agreements.  Albrecht v. \nComm. on Emp. Benefits, 357 F.3d 62, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  In short, Plaintiff’s asserted right to \nreimbursement of the $80 million or continued grant funding “in no sense . . . exist[s] \nindependently of” the grant agreement.  See Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d \n891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (concluding plaintiff’s claim against the government amounted to “a \ncontract dispute” over which a district court lacked jurisdiction under the APA); see Ingersoll-\nRand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  In other words, if there were no \ngrant, there would be no claim. \nThe relief Plaintiff seeks, moreover, only bolsters the conclusion that its APA claims are \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 21 of 36\nessentially contractual in nature.  Plaintiff seeks an order requiring the Government to pay $80 \nmillion in disputed reimbursement costs and to pay the remaining balances on the fiscal year \n2023 and 2024 grant awards.  SAC ¶¶ 239, 262, 291.  Plaintiff does so pursuant to the only \nlegal instrument that would arguably entitle it to any funding at all — i.e., the grants.  Such \nrelief is indistinguishable from the contractual remedy of specific performance, confirming that \nPlaintiff’s claims sound in contract.  Up State, 198 F.3d at 377 (finding no jurisdiction where \nthe relief requested “would be analogous to a contractual remedy for specific performance \nbecause it would enforce an alleged agreement between the parties”). \nAny doubts as to whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s contract-based \nclaims have been dispelled by Department of Education v. California.  In Department of \nEducation, a district court issued a TRO “enjoining the Government from terminating various \neducation-related grants” and “requir[ing] the Government to pay out past-due grant obligations \nand to continue paying obligations as they accrue,” 145 S. Ct. at 968, after it concluded that \nplaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the government’s termination decision was \narbitrary and capricious under the APA.  See California v. U.S. Dep’t of Education, 769 F. Supp. \n3d 72, 78 (D. Mass. 2025).  The Supreme Court stayed the district court’s TRO, determining, \namong other things, that “the Government [was] likely to succeed in showing the District Court \nlacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.”  Dep’t of Education, 145 S. \nCt. at 968.  The Court explained that “the APA’s limited waiver of sovereign immunity does not \nextend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ along the lines of what the \nDistrict Court [had] ordered[.]”  Id. (quoting Great-West, 534 U.S. at 212).  Instead, “the Tucker \nAct grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on ‘any express or implied \ncontract with the United States.’”  Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 22 of 36\nDepartment of Education underscores that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s \ngrant-based claims.  Like the Department of Education plaintiffs, Plaintiff seeks relief from the \ntermination of a grant under which it received federal funding.  Like the Department of \nEducation plaintiffs, Plaintiff challenges that grant termination under the APA, including on the \nground that the termination is arbitrary and capricious.  SAC ¶¶ 238, 247.  Like the district \ncourt in Department of Education, this Court “lack[s] jurisdiction . . . under the APA” to order \nDefendants “to pay money” pursuant to a grant.  Dep’t of Education, 145 S. Ct. at 968. \nThis Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s grant-based APA claims for lack of jurisdiction, \nwhich would be consistent with what other courts have done in similar cases involving \ngovernment grants or contracts in accordance with the Supreme Court’s reasoning in \nDepartment of Education.3  See Sustainability Inst. v. Trump, No. 25-1575, 2025 WL 1587100, \nat *2 (4th Cir. June 5, 2025) (staying injunction where the grants “were awarded by federal \nexecutive agencies to specific grantees from a generalized fund”); Vera Inst. of Just., 2025 WL \n1865160, at *10-12 (dismissing APA arbitrary-and-capricious grant termination claims); U.S. \nConf. of Cath. Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 770 F. Supp. 3d 155, 163 (D.D.C. 2025) (denying \nTRO after concluding that the court lacked the authority to “order the Government to pay \nmoney due on a contract”), dismissed, 2025 WL 1350103 (D.C. Cir. May 2, 2025); Solutions in \nHometown Connections v. Noem, No. 25-cv-885, 2025 WL 1103253, at *8-*10 (D. Md. Apr. \n14, 2025) (denying plaintiffs’ TRO motion challenging the termination of certain U.S. \n \n3 Other decisions from Judges of this District are not to the contrary.  National Job Corps Ass’n \nv. Dep’t of Labor, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052 (S.D.N.Y.

Supp. 3d --, 2025 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 101448 (S.D.N.Y.

Apr. 14, 2025) (dissolving TRO because the \nDepartment of Education order is an “unmistakable directive that, for jurisdictional purposes, \nthe proper forum for this case is the Court of Federal Claims”). \nII.  Grant Funding Decisions Are Committed to Agency Discretion by Law \n \n  Plaintiff’s APA claims in Counts 2, 4, and 5 also fail for a separate reason: an agency’s \ndecision concerning how to allocate and expend funding is “committed to agency discretion by \nlaw” and this is not subject to APA review.  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  In Lincoln v. Vigil, the \nSupreme Court underscored that the APA, by its own terms, “preclude[s] judicial review of \ncertain categories of administrative decisions that courts traditionally have regarded as \n‘committed to agency discretion.’”  508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993) (quoting Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 817 (1992)).  Lincoln held that an agency’s “allocation of funds \nfrom a lump-sum appropriation” is one such “administrative decision traditionally regarded as \ncommitted to agency discretion,” given that “the very point of a lump-sum appropriation,” the \nCourt explained, “is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet \nits statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Id. at 192.  \nThe Court concluded that the Indian Health Service’s decision to discontinue a program that was \n(1) funded through the agency’s yearly lump-sum appropriations (2) but not otherwise mandated \nor prescribed by statute was “committed to [the agency’s] discretion” and thus “unreviewable” \nunder the APA.  Id. at 193–94.  That same principle applies to the discretionary grant funding at \nissue in this case.  The terminated grants are not prescribed by any federal statute or regulation in \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 24 of 36\nterms of whom the recipients are.  Nor has FEMA received funding through targeted \nappropriations that require awarding a grant to Plaintiff.  Although the funds were earmarked \n(“the portion of a lump-sum appropriation designated for a particular purpose,” 2 U.S. Gov’t \nAccountability Off., Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, GAO-06-382SP, at 6-26 (3d ed. \n2006)), for costs to support sheltering and related services by non-Federal entities, Lincoln still \ncontrols.  “Although an agency is required to use earmarked funds for their specified purpose, an \nagency may still exercise discretion within the earmark.”  Amica Ctr. for Immigrant Rts. v. Dep’t \nof Just., No. 25-cv-298 (RDM), 2025 WL 1852762, at *14 (D.D.C. July 6, 2025) (citing In re \nNewport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 55 Comp. Gen. 812 (1976)). \nFurther, the appropriations acts at issue provide no standards “against which to judge the \nagency’s exercise of discretion” in choosing how best to spend that money to advance agency \npriorities.  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985).  The acts appropriate funds to FEMA \n“to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities.”  DHS FY23 \nAppropriations Act, 136 Stat. at 4730; DHS FY24 Appropriations Act, 138 Stat. at 598.  The \nbroad mandates demonstrate that they authorized FEMA to “meet its statutory responsibilities in \nwhat it sees as the most effective or desirable way.” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192–93. \nAs Lincoln made clear, “allocation of funds” from lump-sum appropriations to various \nprograms and priorities “requires ‘a complicated balance[e] of a number of factors,’” including \nwhether the agency’s “‘resources are best spent’ on one program or another” and “whether a \nparticular program ‘best fits the agency’s overall policies.’”  Id. at 193 (quoting Heckler, 470 \nU.S. at 831).  For discretionary grant awards that are funded entirely out of such lump-sum \nappropriations, any decisions regarding how much funding to allocate to a particular grant \nrecipient within the statutory framework — or whether to continue a grant award at all —are \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 25 of 36\ncommitted entirely to the agency’s discretion.  See id. at 193–94.  And that discretion includes \nthe authority to terminate grants that no longer advance agency priorities.  Thus, FEMA’s \n“decision to discontinue” funding for Plaintiff’s grants are “accordingly unreviewable under § \n701(a)(2)” of the APA.  Id. at 193. \nIII.  FEMA Has Not Taken Final Agency Action to Withhold the Disputed $80 Million  \n \n“The APA explicitly requires that an agency action be final before a claim is ripe for \nreview.”  Air Espana v. Brien, 165 F.3d 148, 152 (2d Cir. 1999) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 704).  For an \nagency action to be final, “‘[f]irst, the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process—it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.’”  Salazar \nv. King, 822 F.3d 61, 82 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)).  \nSecond, it must be “‘one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which \nlegal consequences will flow.’”  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 \nU.S. 799, 808 (2024) (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78). \nHere, there is no “final agency action” because the SAC does not allege that Defendants \nhave made a final decision to withhold the $80 million reimbursement on a permanent basis.  \nIndeed, the SAC confirms that Plaintiff was informed that FEMA was “temporarily withholding” \nthe $80 million payment.  SAC ¶¶ 136-38, 151-52.  The February 18, 2025 letter from FEMA \nexplicitly requested more information in order to make a final determination, id. ¶ 152.  Plaintiff \nprovided the information requested on March 14, 2025, and the SAC does not allege that the \nagency has made a final decision in response to this submission.  Id. ¶ 154; see ¶ 213 (funds \navailable and so no need for the Court to address website claim).  As Defendants have not \nprovided a final decision to Plaintiff regarding the requested reimbursement, Counts 1, 3, and 5 \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 26 of 36\nshould be dismissed.4 \nIV.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim That Defendants Have Acted Contrary to Law, Ultra \nVires, or in Excess of Statutory Authority \n \nCounts 3 and 4 of the SAC allege “substantive APA violations” claiming that Defendants \n“cannot unilaterally grab back or refuse to disburse funds appropriated by Congress” in violation \nof the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA), the DHS FY23 and FY 24 Appropriations Acts, \nand various federal regulations.  SAC ¶¶ 256-61, 267-71.  This Court should dismiss these counts \nbecause Plaintiff fails to state a justiciable and plausible claim for relief. \nAs a threshold matter, the ICA and DHS Appropriation Acts do not confer rights that may \nbe enforced through an APA suit.  Cf. Trump v. Sierra Club, 588 U.S. --, 140 S. Ct. 1 (2019) \n(granting stay of injunction, including because “the Government has made a sufficient showing \nat this stage that the plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review of the Acting Secretary’s \ncompliance with” a statute governing the transfer of funds among appropriation accounts). \nTwo related limitations restrict Plaintiff from using the APA’s cause of action to enforce a \nstatute where Congress did not intend such private enforcement. \nFirst, a plaintiff may not seek review under the APA if “statutes preclude judicial review.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1).  By providing a detailed scheme for administrative and judicial review, \nCongress can displace the APA’s default cause of action.  See, e.g., Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., \n467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984).  Preclusion is determined “not only from [the statute’s] express \nlanguage, but also from the structure of the statutory scheme.”  Id.   \n \n4 The Second Circuit has not resolved whether the APA’s “final agency action” and “committed \nto agency discretion” limitations “are truly jurisdictional or are rather essential elements of the \nAPA claims for relief.”  Sharkey v. Quarantillo, 541 F.3d 75, 87 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2)).  Defendants accordingly base their arguments for dismissal under both Rules \n12(b)(1) and (b)(6). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 27 of 36\nSecond, a “plaintiff must establish that the injury” it complains of “falls within the zone \nof interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision” at issue.  Air Courier Conf. of Am. \nv. Am. Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 523-24 (1991) (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife \nFed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990)).  That limitation reflects the common-sense intuition that \nCongress does not intend to extend a cause of action to “plaintiffs who might technically be \ninjured in an Article III sense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory prohibitions” they \nseek to enforce.  Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011); Clarke v. Sec. \nIndus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987). \nAs the ICA reflects, Congress has constructed a reticulated scheme to govern the \nrelationship between the Legislative and Executive Branches when it comes to spending \nappropriated funds.  Dabney v. Reagan, 542 F. Supp. 756, 760 (S.D.N.Y. 1982).  That statute is \nbuilt around give-and-take between the political branches.  The statute directs the President to \nsend a special message to Congress when he proposes to defer or rescind appropriated funds, see \n2 U.S.C. §§ 683(a), 684(a), which allows Congress to determine how to respond given the \nparticular circumstances of a specific proposal.  And the statute specifies particular forms of \nlegislative action that Congress may undertake to address proposed rescissions.  See id. § 688. \nMoreover, insofar as the ICA contemplates litigation to enforce any obligation to spend \nappropriated funds, it provides for suits brought by the Comptroller General, an official within \nthe Legislative Branch, only in United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Id. § \n687.  For that reason, many courts have concluded the ICA does not provide a private cause \nof action.  See Gen. Land Off. of State of Tex. v. Biden, 722 F. Supp. 3d 710, 734–35 (S.D. \nTex. 2024); Pub. Citizen v. Stockman, 528 F. Supp. 824, 830 n.1 (D.D.C. 1981); Rocky Ford \nHous. Auth. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 427 F. Supp. 118, 134 (D.D.C. 1977); Rogers v. United \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 28 of 36\nStates, 14 Cl. Ct. 39, 50 (1987), aff’d, 861 F.2d 729 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  Further, the statute \nimposes limitations on such suits until the Comptroller General files “an explanatory statement” \nof “the circumstances giving rise to the” contemplated suit “with the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President of the Senate” and then “25 calendar days of continuous \nsession of the Congress” elapse.  2 U.S.C. § 687.  The statute does not contemplate enforcement \nby a city government, let alone enforcement without regard to the limitations Congress imposed \non the Comptroller General. \nCongress may impliedly preclude some parties from seeking judicial review of \nadministrative action by constructing a detailed scheme that provides for review only by other \nparties.  See Block, 467 U.S. at 346.  The ICA provides a variety of mechanisms for legislative \nresponses to Executive Branch proposals to defer or rescind appropriated funds and, to the extent \nit contemplates litigation at all, it contemplates only suits brought by a Legislative Branch \nofficial and only after Congress has first had the opportunity to act.  That scheme provides no \nrole for third parties like Plaintiff to play in either the legislative or judicial enforcement \nprocesses.  Moreover, the ICA provides that “[n]othing contained in this Act, or in any \namendments made by this Act, shall be construed” as “affecting in any way the claims or \ndefenses of any party to litigation concerning any impoundment.”  2 U.S.C. § 681.  This makes \nclear Congress’s intent that third parties not rely on the statute to generate a judicially \nenforceable right to compel spending that did not otherwise exist.  See Gen. Land Off., 722 F. \nSupp. 3d at 734 (“alleged ICA violation has only one proper plaintiff: the Comptroller General”). \nFor similar reasons, Plaintiff is not within the zone of interests of the ICA, which is \ndirected at regulating the relationship between Congress and the Executive Branch.  Nothing in \nthe text or history of the ICA establishes an intent to protect or regulate the budgets of city \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 29 of 36\ngovernments who may incur costs associated with federal spending policies.  The ICA is not \nconcerned with protecting New York City’s fisc.  See Stockman, 528 F. Supp. at 830 n.1 (ICA \n“enacted to safeguard Congress’s interests, not those of private citizens” and the absence of \nprivate right of action “pretermit[ted] any contention that plaintiff’s interest in preserving the \nflow of appropriations is within the zone of interests intended to be protected by the ICA”). \nPlaintiff also falls outside the zone of interests of the DHS Appropriations Acts.  These \nacts appropriate funds to DHS “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-\nFederal entities, including facility improvements and construction, in support of relieving \novercrowding in short-term holding facilities of [CBP].”  DHS FY23 Appropriations Act, 136 \nStat. at 4730; DHS FY24 Appropriations Act, 138 Stat. at 598.  These acts regulate and protect \nthe interests of DHS and Congress in the federal spending and appropriations process.  Nothing \nin the text or context of these acts suggests any connection whatsoever to the interests of a city \ngovernment who asserts that discretionary federal spending decisions harm its fisc.  See \nMiccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, No. 08-23523-CIV, 2009 WL 10668917, at \n*4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2009) (dismissing claims brought under a statute appropriating funds to a \nfederal agency for a construction project on zone-of-interests grounds because the statute \nprotected the agency’s interest in receiving funds for the construction project, not an Indian \ntribe’s interests in quiet enjoyment of land near the project).  When Congress appropriated the \nfunds, it did not require DHS to consider the potential impact on city governments or limit \nDHS’s discretion to expend funds to protect those interests.  The Acts govern the relationship \nbetween the Executive and Congress regarding federal spending, and do not confer judicially \ncognizable rights on city governments to second-guess spending decisions. \nThis conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. Sierra Club.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 30 of 36\nThere, the Court stayed an injunction against border wall construction based on a challenge to \nDoD’s compliance with a provision of the DoD Appropriations Act authorizing transfers of funds \nbetween budget accounts.  The Court concluded that a group of environmental plaintiffs likely \n“have no cause of action to obtain review of the Acting Secretary’s compliance with” the DoD \nappropriations transfer statute.  140 S. Ct. at 1.  The dispute in Sierra Club focused on whether \nthe environmental plaintiffs fell within the zone of interests of the appropriations transfer \nprovision they sought to enforce.  See Reply in Support of Application for a Stay Pending \nAppeal, Trump v. Sierra Club, No. 19A60, 2019 WL 3451617, at *3–10 (U.S. July 22, 2019).  As \nthe Supreme Court emphasized, “a statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose \ninterests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.”  See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. \nv. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted).  Like the DoD \ntransfer statute at issue in Sierra Club, Plaintiff alleges violations of federal appropriations acts \nthat protect congressional control over DHS’s appropriations, not the city’s revenue stream. \nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants lacked legal authority “under the C.F.R.” to \nrecover the $80 million reimbursement payment.  See SAC ¶ 260.  But Plaintiff cannot dispute \nDHS’s general authority to withhold (and recover improper) payments from grant recipients \nbased on noncompliance with federal law.  Nor could it: the authority of federal agencies to do so \nis well established in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. Part 200, which broadly recognize agency authority \nto withhold, terminate, suspend, disallow, or recover federal funding.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.339; 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.345(a)(1) (providing that the closeout of a federal award does not affect the “right \nof the Federal agency . . . to disallow costs and recover funds”).  The relevant grant agreements, \nincluding the terms of which Plaintiff has agreed to abide by, confirms this: they state that if an \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 31 of 36\naward recipient is in noncompliance with, among other things, “applicable federal statutes,” the \nagency can “take other remedies,” including “actions to disallow costs, recover funds, wholly or \npartly suspend or terminate the award, initiate suspension and debarment proceedings, withhold \nfurther federal awards, or take other remedies that may be legally available.”  DE 2 at 64-65. \nExpressly among the types of funds that FEMA may recover are “improper payments.”  Id. at 65. \nRecovery of a payment made in error is consistent with FEMA’s general obligation to \nensure that “Federal funding is expended . . . in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, \napplicable Federal statutes and regulations,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a), as well as applicable Bureau \nof Fiscal Service regulations.  In particular, those regulations provide that an entity that \nparticipates in the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network to “originate[] or receive[] a \nGovernment entry agrees to be bound” by the regulations, 31 C.F.R. § 210.3(c), and also agrees \n“[t]hat the Federal Government may reverse any duplicate or erroneous entry or file as provided \nin § 210.6(f) of this part.”  Id. § 210.4(b)(5); see also id. § 210.6(f) (permitting an agency to \n“reverse any duplicate or erroneous entry”).  FEMA therefore had authority to recover the funds. \nV.  Plaintiff’s Constitutional Claims Should Be Dismissed \n \nA.  Plaintiff’s Fifth Amendment Claim Fails (Count 6) \n \nThe Supreme Court has held that “[t]he word ‘person’ in the context of the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any reasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to \nencompass the States of the Union.”  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323 (1966).  It \nfollows that the City of New York has no due process rights either.  See City of Sault Ste. Marie \nv. Andrews, 532 F. Supp. 157, 167-68 (D.D.C. 1980) (city government “is not a person within the \nmeaning of the Fifth Amendment”); El Paso Cnty. Water Improvement Dist. No. 1 v. Int’l \nBoundary & Water Comm'n, 701 F. Supp. 121, 123-24 (W.D. Tex. 1988) (holding that a Texas \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 32 of 36\npolitical subdivision could not assert a due process claim).  Cf. City of N.Y. v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 401 F. Supp. 2d 244, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (not deciding issue but citing Katzenbach, and \nCity of Sault Ste. Marie), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 524 F.3d 384 (2d Cir. 2008). \nEven if the Due Process Clause applies to Plaintiff, its claim fails because Plaintiff has no \nprotected property interest in continued grant funding.  When deciding a due process challenge, \n“[t]he first inquiry . . . is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in \n‘property’ or ‘liberty.’” Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59 (1999) (citation \nomitted).  Without a “cognizable liberty or property interest,” Hettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d \n471, 480 (D.C. Cir. 2012), Plaintiff cannot state a procedural due process claim against the \ngovernment. \nPlaintiff incorrectly asserts that it has a property interest in funds “that were awarded and \nobligated to the City under SSP pending disbursement[.]”  SAC ¶ 296.  The grant agreements are \ncontracts, see supra at 9–12, and “[t]he Supreme Court ‘has never held that government contracts \n. . . create property interests protected by due process.’” New Vision Photography Program, Inc. \nv. District of Columbia, 54 F. Supp. 3d 12, 29 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting 2 Richard J. Pierce Jr., \nAdministrative Law Treatise 764 (5th ed. 2010)).  “Outside of the employment context, courts \nhave resisted application of due-process principles to government contracts because ‘[w]ith \nscores of millions of government contracts in effect at any point in time, it is unimaginable that \nall government agencies would be required to provide a hearing before they take any action that \nis arguably inconsistent with a contract.’”  Id. (quoting Pierce, supra, at 764) (citing cases); see  \nKielczynski v. CIA, 128 F. Supp. 2d 151, 161 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (no basis for jurisdiction over \nplaintiff's due process claims in a contract dispute).  Indeed, several courts have recently held \nthat grant recipients lack protected due process property interests.  See Nat’l Urb. League v. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 33 of 36\nTrump, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 1275613, at *17-19 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025) (denying due \nprocess claim challenging termination of contracts and grants related to diversity, equity, and \ninclusion); Vera Inst. of Just., 2025 WL 1865160, at *16 (“Having failed to establish even a \nplausible property interest in the grant awards, Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims must be \ndismissed.”); see also New Vision Photography, 54 F. Supp. 3d at 28–29 (denying procedural due \nprocess claim based on termination of Medicare provider contract). \nInstead, “a claim that a government agency has violated a party’s right to due process by \nrefusing performance under a contract is substantively indistinguishable from a breach of \ncontract claim,” and “[t]he process to which plaintiff is due . . . is a post-deprivation suit for \nbreach of the contract.”  Suburban Mortg. Assocs., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 480 \nF.3d 1116, 1128 (Fed Cir. 2007). \nThe right to payment on a contract must rise to the level of a constitutionally protected \nproperty interest.   \n“Property interests protected by due process are neither created nor defined by the \nConstitution. ‘Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules \nor understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law--rules or \nunderstandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those \nbenefits.’”  \n \nMartz v. Inc. Vill. of Valley Stream, 22 F.3d 26, 29 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting Bd. of Regents of State \nColls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).  Plaintiff has not cited any such independent source.  \nInstead, this is simply an alleged breach of an ordinary contract that does not rise to the level of a \nconstitutionally protected property interest.  See Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. \nDev., 421 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2005) (“a simple breach of contract does not amount to an \nunconstitutional deprivation of property”). \nFinally, Plaintiff’s due process claim is undermined by its failure to exhaust DHS’s \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 34 of 36\nadministrative appeal process.  The termination letter provided an opportunity to object.  DE 5.  \nTo raise a due process claim, an individual must “‘exhaust[] the full set of available \nadministrative review procedures[.]’” Hadwan v. U.S. Dep't of State, 139 F.4th 209, 227 (2d Cir. \n2025) (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 329 n.10 (1976)). \nB.  Plaintiff’s Separation of Powers and Spending Clause Claims Fail Too  \n \nPlaintiff’s “separation of powers” claim (Count 7) is based entirely on the premise that \nDefendants have “overridden the careful judgments of Congress by acting without legitimate \nbasis or justification in taking back funding and withholding funding” under the DHS \nAppropriations Acts.  SAC ¶ 305.  But this is simply a packaging of its statutory APA claims \n(Counts 3-4) dressed up in constitutional language.  As the Supreme Court has confirmed, \n“claims simply alleging that the President has exceeded his statutory authority are not \n‘constitutional’ claims.”  Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 473 (1994).  In Dalton, the Court \nrejected the proposition that “whenever the President acts in excess of his statutory authority, he \nalso violates the constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine.”  Id. at 471.  Not “every action by \nthe President, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is ipso facto in \nviolation of the Constitution.”  Id. at 472.  In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court \ncarefully “distinguished between claims of constitutional violations and claims that an official \nhas acted in excess of his statutory authority.”  Id. (collecting cases).  The Constitution is \nimplicated only if executive officers rely on it as “[t]he only basis of authority” or if the officers \nrely on an unconstitutional statute.  Id. at 473 & n.5.  Because Plaintiff’s constitutional claims \nfocus entirely on its contentions that DHS and FEMA have not acted consistent with their \nstatutory appropriations obligations, such claims are untenable under Dalton. \nIn any event, Plaintiff identifies no specific provision of the pertinent appropriations acts \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 35 of 36\nthat confers on them the right to receive particular funds.  Instead, it asserts generally that the \ngovernment’s failure to “effectuate the DHS Appropriations Act” is “contrary to law.”  SAC ¶ \n305.  But that claim is simply an “undifferentiated, generalized grievance about the conduct of \ngovernment.”  Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 442 (2007) (per curiam).  Indeed, the Supreme \nCourt has long held that “[a] citizen may not sue” in federal court “based only on an ‘asserted \nright to have the Government act in accordance with law.’”  FDA v. All. for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. 367, 381 (2024) (citation omitted); see Lance, 549 U.S. at 439 (“Our refusal to serve as \na forum for generalized grievances has a lengthy pedigree.”).  Any effort by Plaintiff to challenge \nDefendants’ alleged noncompliance with certain appropriations acts would effectively amount to \nPlaintiff merely lodging “a general legal, moral, ideological, or policy objection to a particular \ngovernment action,” which it lacks standing to do.  Id. \n  Plaintiff’s Spending Clause claim (Count 8) fares no better because the SAC fails to \nidentify any new conditions placed on its receipt of federal funds.  The Spending Clause allows \nCongress to “fix the terms on which it shall disburse federal money to the States.”  Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17; South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).  Conditions on funding must be \n“unambiguous[]” and they cannot “surpris[e] participating States [or localities] with post \nacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”  Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 25.  However, advance notice \nof grant conditions may be provided by the federal grant-making agency, rather than Congress, \n“as long [as] they were grounded in statutory provisions, regulations, and other guidelines \nprovided by the Department at the time of the grant.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 951 F.3d \n84, 110 (2d Cir. 2020) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiff alleges in conclusory fashion that Defendants have violated the Spending Clause \nby “imposing purported new conditions and requirements on SSP funding.”  SAC ¶ 312.  But \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01510-JHR     Document 53     Filed 07/18/25     Page 36 of 36\nPlaintiff does not identify exactly what grant conditions are “new” and “retroactive” and \ntherefore purportedly unconstitutional.  The absence of any specifics is not surprising because \nthe grant awards and the letter of non-compliance that DHS sent Plaintiff in February 2025 \nidentifies terms, conditions. and remedies of which Plaintiff was on notice when it accepted the \nSSP grants.  Id. ¶¶ 70-73, 135-154; see Tennessee v. Becerra, 131 F.4th 350, 363 (6th Cir. 2025) \n(no Spending Clause violation where recipient of funds was on clear notice that it was required \nto follow applicable regulatory requirements and voluntarily agreed to abide by them).  Because \nDefendants have provided Plaintiff with advance notice of terms and conditions of its grant \nawards, Plaintiff’s Spending Clause claim fails.  New York, 951 F.3d at 110. \nCONCLUSION \n \nDefendants respectfully request the Court dismiss the SAC with prejudice for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 7.1(c) \n \nI certify that the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint contains 8,750 words and conforms to the 8,750 word-\ncount limit set by Local Civil Rule 7.1 and the Individual Rules and Practices in Civil Cases. \n \nDated: July 18, 2025         \n              ___S/ Syed Ahmad_________ \nSyed Ahmad (IL Bar 6217343) \nTrial Attorney \nCivil Division, Federal Programs Branch \nU.S. Department of Justice \nWashington, DC 20005 \n202-507-6075 \nsyed.n.ahmad@usdoj.gov \n \n27 \n ",
