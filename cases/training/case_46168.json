Plaintiffs, by their undersigned attorneys, \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 2 of 55  PAGEID #: 2\n \nupon personal knowledge with respect to themselves and their actions and otherwise upon \ninformation and belief, allege as follows: \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  In July 2024, members of a neo-Nazi group called the Blood Tribe \ncoordinated a “hit” on the City of Springfield to stop a purported “invasion” by Haitian \nimmigrants.  Though the vast majority of the immigrants lawfully reside in the United States, \nand had been welcomed by the City, the Blood Tribe insisted that Haitians who settled in \nSpringfield threatened “the good White residents” of Springfield.   \n2.  On August 10, 2024, as the City celebrated its annual Jazz & Blues \nfestival, Blood Tribe members descended on Springfield’s downtown, displaying guns, waving \nswastika flags, and wearing matching red shirts, black pants, and ski masks.  Blood Tribe \nmembers pointed their guns at families attending the festival and yelled racial slurs.1  They then \nmade their way to City Hall where one of their leaders, Drake Berentz, delivered a racist and \nantisemitic rant, claiming that Springfield had been “taken over” and “giv[en] away to savage \nniggers.”2  The Blood Tribe mob responded with chants of “Sieg Heil” and Nazi salutes.3  Blood \nTribe members then bragged on social media about the chaos they had caused, warning that the \n“invasion” of Springfield by Haitian immigrants was a “crime” that would not “go unanswered” \nand promising “we will definitely be back.” \n                                                 \n1 According to a local source, the Blood Tribe pointed their rifles at the car of one family and yelled, “Get the f**k \nback to Africa.”  See Kaitlyn Finchler, Springfield Residents Concerned About City’s Response to People Marching \nwith Rifles, Swastika Flags, Cleveland Jewish News (Aug. 16, 2024), \nhttps://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/local_news/springfield-residents-concerned-about-citys-response-to-\npeople-marching-with-rifles-swastika-flags/article_542512c6-5bde-11ef-971a-9394200c5101.html; see also \nMarshall Weiss, Hate Parade In Springfield, Dayton Jewish Observer (Aug. 22, 2024), \nhttps://daytonjewishobserver.org/2024/08/hate-on-parade-in-springfield/.  \n2 In the interest of accuracy and to convey the hateful nature of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have quoted their \ndocuments and statements verbatim.  \n3 See @Hammer, Blutstamm Marches on Springfield Ohio In Response to NGO Funded Invasion of Haitian \nSavages, odysee.com (posted on Aug. 18, 2024), https://odysee.com/@Hammer:3e/SPRINGFIELD:8. \n2 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 3 of 55  PAGEID #: 3\n \n3.  Two weeks later, on August 24, 2024, the Blood Tribe returned to \nSpringfield.  Berentz directly threatened Springfield’s leaders at a City Commission meeting, \ntelling them that “if you keep importing Haitians, things will get worse,” and ominously stating, \n“you’ve been warned.” \n4.  The Blood Tribe made good on these threats.  Soon thereafter, the City of \nSpringfield and its residents received at least 33 bomb threats, the vast majority of which \nincluded complaints about Springfield’s Haitian immigrants.4  Hospitals, clinics, elementary and \nmiddle schools, universities, private residences, and businesses received anonymous emails and \ntelephone calls purporting to identify the location and detonation time of explosives in each of \nthe respective facilities.  Many City residents, including young school children, were forced to \nevacuate their buildings.  And even though the bomb threats proved to be false alarms, they were \nfrightening and disruptive and required the City of Springfield to expend extensive resources to \nassure the safety of the City and its residents. \n5.  The Blood Tribe then ramped up their intimidating and hateful conduct, \ntargeting Springfield officials they claimed were “complicit” in the purported “invasion” of \nHaitian immigrants.  On September 28, 2024, a dozen members of the Blood Tribe, led by \nBerentz, returned to Springfield, and congregated outside of Mayor Rue’s home.  Once again, \nthey wore red shirts and black pants, covered their faces with masks, and carried swastika flags.  \nAfter taunting the Mayor to “enjoy your peace for now,” the mob headed to City Hall where \nBerentz announced that “Springfield is property of Blood Tribe” and that “we are ready to face \n                                                 \n4 See Alicia Victoria Lozano & Kevin Collier, Bomb Threat In Springfield Spurs Fear and Closures After False \nAnti-Migrant Claims, NBC News (Sept. 12, 2024), https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/bomb-threat-\nspringfield-stokes-fear-false-claims-haitian-migrants-pets-rcna170856; Phil Helsel, More Than 30 Bomb Threats \nMade In Springfield, Ohio, After False Pets Claims, NBC News (Sept. 16, 2024), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/30-bomb-threats-made-springfield-ohio-false-pets-claims-rcna171392.  \n3 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 4 of 55  PAGEID #: 4\n \nthe enemies of the American people in the streets, until the problem is dealt with.”  The Blood \nTribe then celebrated and ratified their hateful conduct on social media, bragging about their visit \nto the Mayor’s home and calling it a “[b]usy weekend for the Tribe.” \n6.  The Blood Tribe also identified Springfield residents who supported the \nHaitian community and set out to terrorize and intimidate them.  The Blood Tribe sent suspicious \npackages designed to look like bombs, left harassing voicemails, sent hateful emails, demeaned \nthe residents and their families on social media platforms, used dating apps to send men looking \nfor drugs and sex to their homes late at night, and publicized their personal information, such as \ntheir telephone numbers, email addresses, and home and work addresses, all the while actively \nencouraging others to harass and intimidate them.   \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action to hold the Blood Tribe, and its leadership,  \nmembers and associates, accountable for their campaign of hate and harassment.  They bring \nclaims for: (1) interfering with Plaintiffs’ civil rights; (2) creating a public nuisance; (3) Ohio \nCode violations of telecommunications harassment, ethnic intimidation, menacing, and inciting \nviolence; and (4) intentionally inflicting emotional distress through their extreme and outrageous \nhate-based conduct. \nTHE PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n8.  The City of Springfield is a municipal corporation located in Southwest \nOhio.  It was founded in 1801 and became the seat of Clark County in 1818.  \n9.  Springfield is an historic manufacturing hub.  It has been the home of \ninternational manufacturing companies such as International Harvester, Champion Farm \nEquipment, and the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company.    \n4 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 5 of 55  PAGEID #: 5\n \n10.  At the turn of the century, Springfield’s population started to decline, and \nthe City faced economic challenges.  Beginning around the same time, the City also began to see \nincreases in immigration, with thousands moving to the City looking for work and a safe place to \nlive.  In the last decade, for example, more than 10,000 immigrants who fled political violence in \nthe Republic of Haiti have settled in Springfield, the vast majority of whom received temporary \nprotected status, allowing them to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.   \n11.  The City of Springfield is governed by a City Commission composed of \nfive members, including the Mayor, all of whom are elected at-large.  Each member of the \nCommission, including the Mayor, serves a four-year term.  The Springfield City School District \n(“SCSD”) serves approximately 7,700 students across 17 buildings.  Springfield is also home to \ntwo hospitals—Mercy Health and Kettering Health—and several government buildings \nincluding City Hall. \n12.  Rob Rue serves as the Mayor of Springfield.  He was first elected to the \nCity Commission in 2017 and was re-elected in 2021.  He was elected separately as Mayor, in \naccordance with the City Charter, in 2023, for a term of four years.   \n13.  In 2024, Rue received multiple bomb threats.  On one occasion, a dozen \nBlood Tribe members and associates, dressed in black hoods and waving Nazi flags, converged \non Rue’s home. \n14.  Assistant Mayor Dr. David Estrop, Krystal Brown, and Tracey Tackett \nserve alongside Rue as City Commissioners.  Each has been threatened by the Blood Tribe for \nsupporting Springfield’s Haitian community.  They have been named in bomb threats and have \nhad their lives threatened. \n5 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 6 of 55  PAGEID #: 6\n \n15.  Taylor Flora lives in Springfield and works at Clark State Community \nCollege (“Clark State”) serving as its only grant development professional.  She has obtained \ngrants to strengthen Clark State’s English as a Second Language (“ESL”) programs, which help \nforeign language speakers, including many Haitian residents, learn to speak and write in English. \n16.  At a City Commission meeting on August 27, 2024, Flora warned the City \nCommissioners that Berentz, a leader of the Blood Tribe who spoke at the meeting, was “a Nazi” \nand should not be given a platform.  The next day, Blood Tribe members began a weeks-long \nintimidation campaign against Flora, harassing her both online and in person.  Among other \nthings, the Blood Tribe “doxed” her, publishing her personal information online, including her \nhome address and telephone numbers, while expressly encouraging its followers to send \nharassing and threatening messages; soliciting men on a dating website to go to Flora’s home in \nthe middle of the night to seek drugs and sex; and sending a suspicious package to her home \ndesigned to appear as a bomb that contained a warning note from the Blood Tribe.     \n17.  Jessica Shafer is a social worker who lives in Springfield, supervises \nseveral therapists in Clark County, and teaches social work at Clark State.  Through her work, \nShafer has become an advocate for the Haitian community. \n18.  Shafer also was targeted by the Blood Tribe after she spoke out in support \nof the Haitian community at City Commission meetings.  Among other things, the Blood Tribe \nposted numerous disparaging remarks about Shafer on social media, calling her, among other \nthings, an “enemy combatant.”  They also “doxed” her, publishing her personal information \nonline, including her home address and telephone numbers, as well as the location and a \nphotograph of her place of employment, while expressly encouraging Blood Tribe followers to \nsend harassing and threatening messages.  And, on multiple occasions, the Blood Tribe followers \n6 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 7 of 55  PAGEID #: 7\n \nsolicited men on a dating website to go to Shafer’s home in the middle of the night to seek drugs \nand sex.   \n19.  Casey Rollins is the Executive Director of the Springfield District Council \nof St. Vincent de Paul, a Catholic charitable organization that, among other things, helps \nimmigrants get work permits, apply for asylum, and obtain other assistance.     \n20.  The Blood Tribe has attacked Rollins on social media, and “doxed” her, \npublishing her personal information online, including her home address and telephone numbers, \nwhile expressly encouraging its followers to send harassing and threatening messages.  She has \nreceived hateful messages calling her a “N— lover” and demanding that she “stop encouraging \nthe migration to Springfield.”  An email address of Rollins’s was hacked, and the hacker used \nthat email address to send a bomb threat. \n21.  Randall Comer is a lifelong resident of Springfield.  The Blood Tribe \n“doxed” Comer after he spoke favorably about the Haitian residents at a City Commission \nmeeting in September 2024, referring to Haitian immigrants as “neighbors” and espousing \nChristian values involving welcoming foreigners.  The Blood Tribe vowed to make Comer’s \nprofessional career “miserable,” calling him a “traitor” to the Blood Tribe’s cause and posting \nphotographs of Comer’s home, place of employment, and wife on social media.  The Blood \nTribe followers solicited a man on a dating website to go to Comer’s home in the middle of the \nnight apparently seeking sex. \n22.  The Blood Tribe’s extreme, outrageous, and malicious conduct \nintentionally and proximately caused Plaintiffs Rue, Estrop, Brown, Tackett, Flora, Rollins, \nShafer, and Comer, serious emotional anguish. \n7 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 8 of 55  PAGEID #: 8\n \nDefendants \n23.  The Blood Tribe is a white supremacist organization,5 founded by \nPohlhaus and led by Pohlhaus and Berentz.  It is a membership organization that claims seven \nregional chapters in the United States and two in Canada.6  It holds rallies where members carry \nthe swastika banner, give the Nazi salute and shout the Nazi chant, “Sieg Heil!”7  Blood Tribe \nleadership recruits members, assesses membership dues, charges fees for participating in events, \nsolicits donations, and sells Nazi-themed merchandise, including the black pants, red shirts, and \nhoods that comprise the Blood Tribe’s uniform.  \n24.  The Blood Tribe’s ideology is based on a white supremacist belief system \nwith roots in Nazism.  It styles itself as the future leadership of the “Aryan” race, claims to act in \n“defense” of the coming “extinction” of the “Aryan race,” and seeks to establish “future Kings \nthat will swear fealty to our Volk” and the “elimination of all anti-White racial hostility.”8  The \nBlood Tribe states that it “despise[s] jew[s] . . . niggers and all non Whites [sic]”9 and members \nof the LGBTQ+ community.10  It seeks a white ethnostate, which entails “[t]he removal of all \nnonwhite and non racially loyal elements from our society.”11  \n                                                 \n5 Blood Tribe (@BloodTribe), Gab.com (Dec. 15, 2023), https://gab.com/BloodTribe/posts/111584497231017686 \n(“everything not explicitly National Socialist is doomed to fail.”); Blood Tribe (@BloodTribe), Gab.com, (Jan. 19, \n2024), https://gab.com/BloodTribe/posts/111785397296615469 (“We are Nazis We are White supremacists We are \nWhite Ethno Nationalists [sic]”). \n6 ADL Center on Extremism, The Blood Tribe, adl.org, https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/blood-tribe. \n7 Christopher Pohlhaus (HAMMER), BLUTSTAMM MARCHES ON HARRISBURG PA AUG/24/2024, \nhttps://odysee.com/@Hammer:3e/HARRISBURG:a from 1:54; Blood Tribe (@BloodTribe), Gab.com (Jan. 26, \n2024), https://gab.com/BloodTribe/posts/111822654200083655.  \n8 Christopher Pohlhaus (HAMMER), HERZOG HIGGER’S AND HAMMER’S END OF YEAR SPEECHES, \nodysee.com (Nov. 20, 2023), https://odysee.com/@Hammer:3e/Yearendspeech:a 9:00 to 13:00. \n9 Blood Tribe (@BloodTribe), Gab.com, (Jan. 19, 2024), https://gab.com/BloodTribe/posts/111785397296615469. \n10See Blood Tribe (@BloodTribe), Gab.com (Sept. 30, 2024), \nhttps://gab.com/BloodTribe/posts/113226744870822081; FNTV, Neo-Nazis, White Lives Matter and Proud Boys \nProtest Drag Story Hour event in Wadsworth Ohio, Youtube.com (Mar. 16, 2023), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moxzSxwwmio. \n11 Drake Berentz (@higgers_nj), x.com (Nov. 29, 2024 at 12:46 p.m.), \nhttps://x.com/higgers_nj/status/1862553664629477481. \n8 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 9 of 55  PAGEID #: 9\n \n25.

Christopher Pohlhaus, who also goes by the names “Hammer,” \n“Blutkönig,” and “The Blood King,” is the founder of the Blood Tribe.13  Pohlhaus was incensed \nby the arrival of Haitian immigrants in Springfield and has repeatedly encouraged Blood Tribe \nmembers and associates to “hit” Springfield.  In September 2024, Pohlhaus posted on social \nmedia that “[o]ur boots are literally on the ground [in Springfield] every week,” “[w]e have a \nnetwork of local informants,” “have marched there under the Swastika and . . . will continue to \ndo so.”  As he boasted to his followers, “[w]e put Springfield in the public consciousness.”  \n27.  Drake Berentz, who also uses the thinly veiled racist names “Nate \nHiggers” and “Herzog Higgers,” is a leader of the Blood Tribe and coordinated the Blood Tribe’s \nactivity in Springfield.  Berentz led the August 10, 2024 armed foray into Springfield during its \nJazz and Blues festival, threatened the Mayor and Commissioners at the August 27, 2024 City \nCommission meeting, and led the September 28, 2024 confrontation of Mayor Rue and his \nfamily at their home.  He has threatened Springfield, its officials, and its residents with violence \nand has participated in the public dissemination of Shafer’s personal information.  \n28.

For much of the 20th century, Springfield served as a manufacturing hub \nand was home to many companies that manufactured metal, farming equipment, food and \nbeverages, and other products sold throughout the United States and abroad.   \n11 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 12 of 55  PAGEID #: 12\n \n43.  In recent decades, manufacturing jobs in Springfield became scarcer and \nSpringfield began to experience economic challenges.  Springfield’s population declined from \napproximately 80,000 residents in the 1970s, to approximately 60,000 in 2015.14  Median \nincomes in Springfield fell 27% between 1999 and 2014.15   \n44.  In recent years, Springfield has seen an increase in newly arrived, lawful \nimmigrants to the United States.16  Many came from the Republic of Haiti, a country that has \nbeen engulfed by political turmoil for decades, and had secured Temporary Protected Status, \nallowing them to live and work lawfully in the United States.   \n45.  With more than 10,000 new residents, employers brought new businesses \nto Springfield and expanded existing businesses.17  Employers in Springfield have praised the \nwork ethic of their new Haitian employees, reporting that “[t]hey come to work every day.

On September 28, 2024, Berentz and about a dozen Blood Tribe members, \nwearing red shirts, black clothes, and black facemasks and holding swastika flags, gathered \noutside of Rue’s home.  The men warned Rue to “enjoy your peace now, until we come back.”  \nFearing for his safety and that of his family, Rue had his shotgun loaded and by the front door of \nhis home in case he needed to protect his family. \n202409,2816:19:59 I Front Lawn  — \na \nVic.\n_ \nVr \neV_ \niti  'a \nry \n \n89.

Based upon these and other incidents, Springfield, at substantial expense, \nhas increased the security for Rue and others close to him.   \nHarassment and Intimidation of Springfield’s Commissioners \n92.  Springfield City Commissioners have been the target of threats from the \nBlood Tribe or those incited by the Blood Tribe.  As noted earlier, the bomb threat on September \n12 mentioned each Commissioner by name, and included the chilling message, “I will kill you, I \nknow where you live.”   \n93.  Tackett’s personal information was posted on X (formerly known as \nTwitter), and she received numerous threats and hateful messages to her email and on social \nmedia.  Her inbox has been so flooded with cruel and threatening emails that she records them in \na “Haters” folder.  \n94.  Tackett’s mother was also harassed and intimidated.  On one occasion, for \nexample, an individual came to her home, removed one of the flags that had been planted in her \nfront yard, and re-planted it upside down. \n95.  Brown’s personal information was posted on X (formerly known as \nTwitter), and she received numerous threats and hateful messages to her email and on social \nmedia.   \n96.

She had to redirect significant attention and \nresources to assist in helping her particularly vulnerable students deal with these horrific events. \n97.  The Springfield City Clerk has received threatening communications, both \nin writing and over the phone.  For several weeks, her phone was “ringing off the wall” and she \nwas receiving “some pretty nasty stuff.” \nHarassment and Intimidation of Flora \n98.  After Flora warned Springfield’s Commissioners that Berentz was a Nazi, \nthe Blood Tribe, including John Doe 1, began a campaign of harassment against her.   \n99.  On August 31, 2024, within a 15-minute span from 11:23 p.m. to 11:38 \np.m., Flora received nine harassing and violent voicemails from John Doe 1.   \n100.  On September 1, 2024, at 11:49 a.m., Flora received an email from John \nDoe 3 asking if she would “write us a grant to remove all of the Haitian niggers out of \nSpringfield” and stating “[s]urely there must be some money available somewhere for that.”  The \nemail threatened to “find out” if Flora’s partner was “making money off the landlords housing” \nthe Haitian immigrants.   \n101.  On September 1, 2024, at 3:06 p.m., Flora received another voicemail \nfrom John Doe 1, who let her know that he knew a great deal about her and her family.  John \nDoe 1 identified the name of the street she lives on, referred to her husband, claiming that he is \n“making money off the landlords housing these niggers,” and referred to Flora’s work writing \ngrants, asking her to “write us a grant to remove all of the Haitian niggers out of Springfield.” \n102.  Flora received a message from John Doe 1 on September 4, 2024, \nthreatening her and hinting at sexual violence: \n“I’m looking for a fat woman.  Maybe your the lucky one.

Flora called the Springfield \npolice and asked for the bomb squad to confirm the package did not contain an explosive.  It did \nnot, but it did contain a note that read, “XOXO, Blood Tribe.”   \n104.  In mid-September, the Blood Tribe, including at least John Doe 4, sent \nstrangers to Flora’s house at night.  The first man stood at the door, but Flora did not answer.  He \neventually returned to his truck and remained there for approximately 20 minutes.  Flora called \nthe police, but the man drove away before they arrived.   \n105.  The second man arrived shortly thereafter, and the police were waiting for \nhim.  He told the police that he had been sent to Flora’s home based on a fake profile set up on \nFlora’s behalf on a dating application and was instructed to enter the house without knocking.  \nHarassment and Intimidation of Shafer \n106.

Shafer spoke out again at a City Commission meeting on October 8, 2024, \ndescribing how she had been targeted by the Blood Tribe.36  The Blood Tribe responded by \nsubjecting Shafer to a barrage of harassment and intimidation. \n108.

He slowly feeds poison into \nthe public discourse of the town by first dripping it into the ear of his unsuspecting shiksa meat puppet, \nwho he then sends out to poison the town well at the commissioners meetings. Like the true effeminate \ncoward he is, he prefers using his woman as a human shield to \"fight nazis\" while he conveniently hides in \nthe shadows. \nWhen we think back on some of the more vocal Springfield shitlibs we have exposed so far. Taylor and Seth \nFlora, Chelsea and Matt Weber, Aiden Clark's parents, Amanda Richardson, and of course Jess Schafer - one \nthing we note is how they all seem to think politics is a joke, or maybe a game: an extension of the cheery \nfaux-battles of their college campus days where the faculty and professors all had their thumb on the \nboard - something to play at and use for 5 minutes of local fame. All of them now are certainly shocked to \nwake up and discover that real world politics is no fucking joke. It is deadly serious, because it is in reality a \nprojection of power. It is a game of indirect and direct force and therefore, more akin to war than anything \nelse. This is why it exists in the domain of men. Women who play at politics better bring their Hillary Clinton \nsuicide game, or gtfo. \nJess understands this now - we can tell from the dark circles under her eyes and the sad tiredness in her \nvoice. All the pep seems to have gone out of her \"nazi slaying\" - Certainly cowardly Mickey already \nunderstood, considering he keeps a firearm in his house ready to go. How many times a night have you \nhave to get that thing out, Mick? Did you make the niggers at your door as comfortable as you claim to \nwant the Haitians to be? How does it feel to know that not only we, apparently, but many of the people in \nyour own town and neighborhood hate you and your destructive anti-White rhetoric as well? Clark County \nvoted overwhelmingly for \"fascism\" - It has warmed our heart to see the locals of Springfield stepping up \nand stepping into the battle for their own interests. What's that song by your fellow jew, Billy Joel? Oh \nyeah, \"Movin' Out\" - get on it, Mick. \npostimg.cc/V1w4qWF1   \n115.  Blood Tribe members continued to harass Shafer and other supporters of \nthe Haitian community on social media, calling them “race traitors” and threatening that they are \n“on the menu.”  A comment on one of the posts, referring to Shafer, threatened that if the \ncommenter were in power, “the first thing I’d do after exterminating all the kikes and shitskins \nwould be to ruthlessly hunt down any and all race traitors like this skank and give them the same \ntreatment . . .

Today we look at a catholic-\nrelated charity organization. Casey may seem like a very strange bird to you blokes, but she is \nactually a pretty typical boomer. She suffers from the self-important delusion that she is a \ngreat person and do-gooder all while actually helping to betray her own people and destroy \nthe patrimony she was given for her own progeny. \nCasey sees no contradiction in her heart being a registered democrat and voting for baby-\nkilling ghouls while sauntering up to communion every week to scarf down her spiritual cookie. \nPerhaps this is also why she sees no difference in providing basic charitable necessities like \nfood and clothing for the local poor, and actively assisting haitian niggers in their cultural and \neconomic invasion of our country by providing them with immigration lawyers and steering \nthem through the legalities of oblairriny work permits to displace While working dabs \nAmericans (both in jobs and hazing). Haitian niggers have NO RIGHT to work in this country. \nThey are not entitled to leech off of our economy just because they are eating cats, dogs, and \npeople back home (barbecue)... \nCasey, living in her self-centered delusion, is incapable of seeing her role in actively creating all \nof the \"ugly\" things about the current situation in Springfield. She is too busy receiving \ndopamine hits from her nigger 'charity' work. The Good Samaritan did not help the robbed and \nbeaten man at the expense of his own family and nation.

She is \nunfortunately a crass, self-centered race traitor, just like all the rest of the Shitlibs we have so \nfar encountered in Springfield. Somehow, like Archbishop Schnurr, we do not think her \nimpending judgement by her gal will go quite like she so smugly thinks. \nLet Casey know that true charity must first start at home and prioritize the needs of our Tribe \nand that helping others to the detriment of your own family is NOT charity, but traitorous. \nimgur.com/a/wFNTNPA \n \n119.
