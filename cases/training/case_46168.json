    "summary": "<p>This case is about a series of alleged actions taken by the &ldquo;Blood Tribe,&rdquo; a white supremacist group, in Springfield, Ohio. From July 2024 to September 2024, the &ldquo;Blood Tribe&rdquo; engaged in conduct aimed at the Haitian immigrant community in Springfield, along with other nonwhite groups and those opposed to white supremacy.

Plaintiffs, by their undersigned attorneys, \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 2 of 55  PAGEID #: 2\n \nupon personal knowledge with respect to themselves and their actions and otherwise upon \ninformation and belief, allege as follows: \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  In July 2024, members of a neo-Nazi group called the Blood Tribe \ncoordinated a โhitโ on the City of Springfield to stop a purported โinvasionโ by Haitian \nimmigrants.  Though the vast majority of the immigrants lawfully reside in the United States, \nand had been welcomed by the City, the Blood Tribe insisted that Haitians who settled in \nSpringfield threatened โthe good White residentsโ of Springfield.   \n2.  On August 10, 2024, as the City celebrated its annual Jazz & Blues \nfestival, Blood Tribe members descended on Springfieldโs downtown, displaying guns, waving \nswastika flags, and wearing matching red shirts, black pants, and ski masks.  Blood Tribe \nmembers pointed their guns at families attending the festival and yelled racial slurs.1  They then \nmade their way to City Hall where one of their leaders, Drake Berentz, delivered a racist and \nantisemitic rant, claiming that Springfield had been โtaken overโ and โgiv[en] away to savage \nniggers.โ2  The Blood Tribe mob responded with chants of โSieg Heilโ and Nazi salutes.3  Blood \nTribe members then bragged on social media about the chaos they had caused, warning that the \nโinvasionโ of Springfield by Haitian immigrants was a โcrimeโ that would not โgo unansweredโ \nand promising โwe will definitely be back.โ \n                                                 \n1 According to a local source, the Blood Tribe pointed their rifles at the car of one family and yelled, โGet the f**k \nback to Africa.โ  See Kaitlyn Finchler, Springfield Residents Concerned About Cityโs Response to People Marching \nwith Rifles, Swastika Flags, Cleveland Jewish News (Aug. 16, 2024), \nhttps://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/local_news/springfield-residents-concerned-about-citys-response-to-\npeople-marching-with-rifles-swastika-flags/article_542512c6-5bde-11ef-971a-9394200c5101.html; see also \nMarshall Weiss, Hate Parade In Springfield, Dayton Jewish Observer (Aug. 22, 2024), \nhttps://daytonjewishobserver.org/2024/08/hate-on-parade-in-springfield/.  \n2 In the interest of accuracy and to convey the hateful nature of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs have quoted their \ndocuments and statements verbatim.  \n3 See @Hammer, Blutstamm Marches on Springfield Ohio In Response to NGO Funded Invasion of Haitian \nSavages, odysee.com (posted on Aug. 18, 2024), https://odysee.com/@Hammer:3e/SPRINGFIELD:8. \n2 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 3 of 55  PAGEID #: 3\n \n3.  Two weeks later, on August 24, 2024, the Blood Tribe returned to \nSpringfield.  Berentz directly threatened Springfieldโs leaders at a City Commission meeting, \ntelling them that โif you keep importing Haitians, things will get worse,โ and ominously stating, \nโyouโve been warned.โ \n4.  The Blood Tribe made good on these threats.  Soon thereafter, the City of \nSpringfield and its residents received at least 33 bomb threats, the vast majority of which \nincluded complaints about Springfieldโs Haitian immigrants.4  Hospitals, clinics, elementary and \nmiddle schools, universities, private residences, and businesses received anonymous emails and \ntelephone calls purporting to identify the location and detonation time of explosives in each of \nthe respective facilities.  Many City residents, including young school children, were forced to \nevacuate their buildings.  And even though the bomb threats proved to be false alarms, they were \nfrightening and disruptive and required the City of Springfield to expend extensive resources to \nassure the safety of the City and its residents. \n5.  The Blood Tribe then ramped up their intimidating and hateful conduct, \ntargeting Springfield officials they claimed were โcomplicitโ in the purported โinvasionโ of \nHaitian immigrants.  On September 28, 2024, a dozen members of the Blood Tribe, led by \nBerentz, returned to Springfield, and congregated outside of Mayor Rueโs home.  Once again, \nthey wore red shirts and black pants, covered their faces with masks, and carried swastika flags.  \nAfter taunting the Mayor to โenjoy your peace for now,โ the mob headed to City Hall where \nBerentz announced that โSpringfield is property of Blood Tribeโ and that โwe are ready to face \n                                                 \n4 See Alicia Victoria Lozano & Kevin Collier, Bomb Threat In Springfield Spurs Fear and Closures After False \nAnti-Migrant Claims, NBC News (Sept. 12, 2024), https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/bomb-threat-\nspringfield-stokes-fear-false-claims-haitian-migrants-pets-rcna170856; Phil Helsel, More Than 30 Bomb Threats \nMade In Springfield, Ohio, After False Pets Claims, NBC News (Sept. 16, 2024), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/30-bomb-threats-made-springfield-ohio-false-pets-claims-rcna171392.  \n3 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 4 of 55  PAGEID #: 4\n \nthe enemies of the American people in the streets, until the problem is dealt with.โ  The Blood \nTribe then celebrated and ratified their hateful conduct on social media, bragging about their visit \nto the Mayorโs home and calling it a โ[b]usy weekend for the Tribe.โ \n6.  The Blood Tribe also identified Springfield residents who supported the \nHaitian community and set out to terrorize and intimidate them.  The Blood Tribe sent suspicious \npackages designed to look like bombs, left harassing voicemails, sent hateful emails, demeaned \nthe residents and their families on social media platforms, used dating apps to send men looking \nfor drugs and sex to their homes late at night, and publicized their personal information, such as \ntheir telephone numbers, email addresses, and home and work addresses, all the while actively \nencouraging others to harass and intimidate them.   \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action to hold the Blood Tribe, and its leadership,  \nmembers and associates, accountable for their campaign of hate and harassment.  They bring \nclaims for: (1) interfering with Plaintiffsโ civil rights; (2) creating a public nuisance; (3) Ohio \nCode violations of telecommunications harassment, ethnic intimidation, menacing, and inciting \nviolence; and (4) intentionally inflicting emotional distress through their extreme and outrageous \nhate-based conduct. \nTHE PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n8.  The City of Springfield is a municipal corporation located in Southwest \nOhio.  It was founded in 1801 and became the seat of Clark County in 1818.  \n9.  Springfield is an historic manufacturing hub.  It has been the home of \ninternational manufacturing companies such as International Harvester, Champion Farm \nEquipment, and the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company.    \n4 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 5 of 55  PAGEID #: 5\n \n10.  At the turn of the century, Springfieldโs population started to decline, and \nthe City faced economic challenges.  Beginning around the same time, the City also began to see \nincreases in immigration, with thousands moving to the City looking for work and a safe place to \nlive.  In the last decade, for example, more than 10,000 immigrants who fled political violence in \nthe Republic of Haiti have settled in Springfield, the vast majority of whom received temporary \nprotected status, allowing them to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.   \n11.  The City of Springfield is governed by a City Commission composed of \nfive members, including the Mayor, all of whom are elected at-large.  Each member of the \nCommission, including the Mayor, serves a four-year term.  The Springfield City School District \n(โSCSDโ) serves approximately 7,700 students across 17 buildings.  Springfield is also home to \ntwo hospitalsโMercy Health and Kettering Healthโand several government buildings \nincluding City Hall. \n12.  Rob Rue serves as the Mayor of Springfield.  He was first elected to the \nCity Commission in 2017 and was re-elected in 2021.  He was elected separately as Mayor, in \naccordance with the City Charter, in 2023, for a term of four years.   \n13.  In 2024, Rue received multiple bomb threats.  On one occasion, a dozen \nBlood Tribe members and associates, dressed in black hoods and waving Nazi flags, converged \non Rueโs home. \n14.  Assistant Mayor Dr. David Estrop, Krystal Brown, and Tracey Tackett \nserve alongside Rue as City Commissioners.  Each has been threatened by the Blood Tribe for \nsupporting Springfieldโs Haitian community.  They have been named in bomb threats and have \nhad their lives threatened. \n5 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 6 of 55  PAGEID #: 6\n \n15.  Taylor Flora lives in Springfield and works at Clark State Community \nCollege (โClark Stateโ) serving as its only grant development professional.  She has obtained \ngrants to strengthen Clark Stateโs English as a Second Language (โESLโ) programs, which help \nforeign language speakers, including many Haitian residents, learn to speak and write in English. \n16.  At a City Commission meeting on August 27, 2024, Flora warned the City \nCommissioners that Berentz, a leader of the Blood Tribe who spoke at the meeting, was โa Naziโ \nand should not be given a platform.  The next day, Blood Tribe members began a weeks-long \nintimidation campaign against Flora, harassing her both online and in person.  Among other \nthings, the Blood Tribe โdoxedโ her, publishing her personal information online, including her \nhome address and telephone numbers, while expressly encouraging its followers to send \nharassing and threatening messages; soliciting men on a dating website to go to Floraโs home in \nthe middle of the night to seek drugs and sex; and sending a suspicious package to her home \ndesigned to appear as a bomb that contained a warning note from the Blood Tribe.     \n17.  Jessica Shafer is a social worker who lives in Springfield, supervises \nseveral therapists in Clark County, and teaches social work at Clark State.  Through her work, \nShafer has become an advocate for the Haitian community. \n18.  Shafer also was targeted by the Blood Tribe after she spoke out in support \nof the Haitian community at City Commission meetings.  Among other things, the Blood Tribe \nposted numerous disparaging remarks about Shafer on social media, calling her, among other \nthings, an โenemy combatant.โ  They also โdoxedโ her, publishing her personal information \nonline, including her home address and telephone numbers, as well as the location and a \nphotograph of her place of employment, while expressly encouraging Blood Tribe followers to \nsend harassing and threatening messages.  And, on multiple occasions, the Blood Tribe followers \n6 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 7 of 55  PAGEID #: 7\n \nsolicited men on a dating website to go to Shaferโs home in the middle of the night to seek drugs \nand sex.   \n19.  Casey Rollins is the Executive Director of the Springfield District Council \nof St. Vincent de Paul, a Catholic charitable organization that, among other things, helps \nimmigrants get work permits, apply for asylum, and obtain other assistance.     \n20.  The Blood Tribe has attacked Rollins on social media, and โdoxedโ her, \npublishing her personal information online, including her home address and telephone numbers, \nwhile expressly encouraging its followers to send harassing and threatening messages.  She has \nreceived hateful messages calling her a โNโ loverโ and demanding that she โstop encouraging \nthe migration to Springfield.โ  An email address of Rollinsโs was hacked, and the hacker used \nthat email address to send a bomb threat. \n21.  Randall Comer is a lifelong resident of Springfield.  The Blood Tribe \nโdoxedโ Comer after he spoke favorably about the Haitian residents at a City Commission \nmeeting in September 2024, referring to Haitian immigrants as โneighborsโ and espousing \nChristian values involving welcoming foreigners.  The Blood Tribe vowed to make Comerโs \nprofessional career โmiserable,โ calling him a โtraitorโ to the Blood Tribeโs cause and posting \nphotographs of Comerโs home, place of employment, and wife on social media.  The Blood \nTribe followers solicited a man on a dating website to go to Comerโs home in the middle of the \nnight apparently seeking sex. \n22.  The Blood Tribeโs extreme, outrageous, and malicious conduct \nintentionally and proximately caused Plaintiffs Rue, Estrop, Brown, Tackett, Flora, Rollins, \nShafer, and Comer, serious emotional anguish. \n7 \n\nCase: 3:25-cv-00033-WHR-PBS Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/06/25 Page: 8 of 55  PAGEID #: 8\n \nDefendants \n23.  The Blood Tribe is a white supremacist organization,5 founded by \nPohlhaus and led by Pohlhaus and Berentz.

He slowly feeds poison into \nthe public discourse of the town by first dripping it into the ear of his unsuspecting shiksa meat puppet, \nwho he then sends out to poison the town well at the commissioners meetings. Like the true effeminate \ncoward he is, he prefers using his woman as a human shield to \"fight nazis\" while he conveniently hides in \nthe shadows. \nWhen we think back on some of the more vocal Springfield shitlibs we have exposed so far. Taylor and Seth \nFlora, Chelsea and Matt Weber, Aiden Clark's parents, Amanda Richardson, and of course Jess Schafer - one \nthing we note is how they all seem to think politics is a joke, or maybe a game: an extension of the cheery \nfaux-battles of their college campus days where the faculty and professors all had their thumb on the \nboard - something to play at and use for 5 minutes of local fame. All of them now are certainly shocked to \nwake up and discover that real world politics is no fucking joke. It is deadly serious, because it is in reality a \nprojection of power. It is a game of indirect and direct force and therefore, more akin to war than anything \nelse. This is why it exists in the domain of men. Women who play at politics better bring their Hillary Clinton \nsuicide game, or gtfo. \nJess understands this now - we can tell from the dark circles under her eyes and the sad tiredness in her \nvoice. All the pep seems to have gone out of her \"nazi slaying\" - Certainly cowardly Mickey already \nunderstood, considering he keeps a firearm in his house ready to go. How many times a night have you \nhave to get that thing out, Mick? Did you make the niggers at your door as comfortable as you claim to \nwant the Haitians to be? How does it feel to know that not only we, apparently, but many of the people in \nyour own town and neighborhood hate you and your destructive anti-White rhetoric as well? Clark County \nvoted overwhelmingly for \"fascism\" - It has warmed our heart to see the locals of Springfield stepping up \nand stepping into the battle for their own interests. What's that song by your fellow jew, Billy Joel? Oh \nyeah, \"Movin' Out\" - get on it, Mick. \npostimg.cc/V1w4qWF1   \n115.  Blood Tribe members continued to harass Shafer and other supporters of \nthe Haitian community on social media, calling them โrace traitorsโ and threatening that they are \nโon the menu.โ  A comment on one of the posts, referring to Shafer, threatened that if the \ncommenter were in power, โthe first thing Iโd do after exterminating all the kikes and shitskins \nwould be to ruthlessly hunt down any and all race traitors like this skank and give them the same \ntreatment . . .

She is the head of the \nSt. Vincent de Paul Society for Springfield. We dealt with Archbishop Schnurr and the trouble \nthe communist Catholic bishops are causing the people of Ohio. Today we look at a catholic-\nrelated charity organization. Casey may seem like a very strange bird to you blokes, but she is \nactually a pretty typical boomer. She suffers from the self-important delusion that she is a \ngreat person and do-gooder all while actually helping to betray her own people and destroy \nthe patrimony she was given for her own progeny. \nCasey sees no contradiction in her heart being a registered democrat and voting for baby-\nkilling ghouls while sauntering up to communion every week to scarf down her spiritual cookie. \nPerhaps this is also why she sees no difference in providing basic charitable necessities like \nfood and clothing for the local poor, and actively assisting haitian niggers in their cultural and \neconomic invasion of our country by providing them with immigration lawyers and steering \nthem through the legalities of oblairriny work permits to displace While working dabs \nAmericans (both in jobs and hazing). Haitian niggers have NO RIGHT to work in this country. \nThey are not entitled to leech off of our economy just because they are eating cats, dogs, and \npeople back home (barbecue)... \nCasey, living in her self-centered delusion, is incapable of seeing her role in actively creating all \nof the \"ugly\" things about the current situation in Springfield. She is too busy receiving \ndopamine hits from her nigger 'charity' work. The Good Samaritan did not help the robbed and \nbeaten man at the expense of his own family and nation. He helped out of locality and an \nabundance of potential. Casey Rollins, despite her own opinion, is no Good Samaritan. She is \nunfortunately a crass, self-centered race traitor, just like all the rest of the Shitlibs we have so \nfar encountered in Springfield. Somehow, like Archbishop Schnurr, we do not think her \nimpending judgement by her gal will go quite like she so smugly thinks. \nLet Casey know that true charity must first start at home and prioritize the needs of our Tribe \nand that helping others to the detriment of your own family is NOT charity, but traitorous. \nimgur.com/a/wFNTNPA \n \n119.

The City of Springfield has incurred significant expenditures as a direct \nand proximate result of having to respond to Defendantsโ misconduct over and above the costs of \nthe Cityโs ordinary public services. \n157.

The City of Springfield seeks to abate the nuisance created by the \nDefendantsโ unreasonable, unlawful, intentional, ongoing, continuing, and persistent actions and \nomissions and unreasonable interference with rights common to the general public. \n161.
