Plaintiffs are teacher education programs across the United States represented by private counsel. They named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), and its Secretary as Defendants. The case was assigned to Judge Julie Rebecca Rubin.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that the Department of Education &ldquo;summarily terminated&rdquo; many of the grant programs that the plaintiff-educators rely on from the DOE, including the Teacher Quality Partnership Program (TQP), the Supporting Effective Educator Development Program (SEED), and the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program (TSL). The Plaintiffs argued that the terminations were &ldquo;unlawful in reliance on Executive Order 14151&rdquo; and that DOE failed to &ldquo;follow statute and Federal regulations in terminating the grants.&rdquo; While the official reason for these actions was that the grants were &ldquo;inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], Department priorities,&rdquo; DOE then published a press release titled &ldquo;U.S. Department of Education Cuts $600 Million in Grants Used to Train Teachers and Education Agencies on Divisive Ideologies.&rdquo; The Plaintiffs argued that the official justification for termination of the grants was unlawful because DOE did not follow regulations in terminating the grant. They also argued that the published reason is unlawful because it is based on portions of the Executive Order which this court already enjoined.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs claimed that the grant termination provisions of the Executive Order are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. They also claimed that termination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 3, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a TRO and/or a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from terminating the grants at issue. A hearing for a preliminary injunction was held on March 13, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court issued a memorandum opinion on March 17, 2025, granting in part and denying in part Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction. 770 F.Supp.3d 822. The court examined Plaintiff&rsquo;s Fifth Amendment claim, finding that &ldquo;the record before the court at this time fails to demonstrate that the Department likely terminated the Grant Awards at the directive of Executive Order 14151.&rdquo; The court found, however, that the termination of the grant programs violated the APA. The court reasoned that &ldquo;the Department&rsquo;s action was unreasonable, not reasonably explained, based on factors Congress had not intended the Department to consider (i.e., not agency priorities), and otherwise not in accordance with law.&rdquo; The court thus found that Plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction, under which Defendants must reinstate the grant awards consistent with their status immediately prior to the termination letters.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2025, Defendants filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. They claimed the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Tucker Act. The court denied the motion the following day. 2025 WL 863319. Defendants filed a motion to stay on March 20, 2025, which the court also denied the next day. 2025 WL 890560.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2025, Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit granted a stay pending appeal on April 10, 2025, based on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s recent stay in <a href=\"../../../../case/46201/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Education v. California</a>. 2025 WL 1232337. In that case, the Supreme Court held that &ldquo;the APA&rsquo;s limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity does not extend to orders to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money along the lines of what the District Court ordered here,&rdquo; and that the Tucker Act granted jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for suits based on &ldquo;any express or implied contract with the United States.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Rule 60(b) Motion to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction granted on March 27, 2025, and a Request for Indicative Ruling Under Rule 62.1 at the District Court. The District Court denied the motion in light of the Fourth Circuit&rsquo;s stay of the preliminary injunction and the pending appeal.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenges the Department of Education’s decision, following President Trump’s Executive Order 14151, to end $600 million in federal funding for teacher preparation programs. On March 3, 2025, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education and related groups sued President Trump, the Department of Education, and its Secretary. Plaintiffs argued that the Department unlawfully terminated important federal grants, such as the Teacher Quality Partnership Program, without following required procedures or regulations.\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs claimed this violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious.” Plaintiffs sought to stop the Department from ending these grants through a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The court partially granted their request, citing APA violations, and ordered the Department to reinstate the grants.\r\n\r\nThe Department appealed, and theFourth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the injunction, citing a recent Supreme Court decision on similar issues (Department of Education v. California). Later, plaintiffs’ motion to dissolve the injunction was denied due to the pending appeal and the existing stay. \r\n\r\nThe case is ongoing.",

This Court has recently stayed pending appeal a \nseparate district-court order that precluded a wide set of federal agencies \nfrom carrying out the President’s directive to stop funding, to the extent \nconsistent with applicable law, programs promoting diversity, equity, and \ninclusion (“DEI”).  See Order, National Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher \nEduc. v. Trump, No. 25-1189 (4th Cir. Mar. 14, 2025).  The interference with \nthe Executive Branch’s funding priorities is no more warranted in this case \nthan in that one.  We request a stay pending appeal. \nThere is no dispute here that the Department had authority to \nterminate a funding agreement that “no longer effectuates the program \ngoals or agency priorities,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  The district court \nerroneously concluded that an alleged violation of that condition, which \n\n \nwas incorporated into the written funding agreements, was properly \nadjudicated in district court rather than in the Court of Federal Claims, \nwhich has exclusive jurisdiction over the contract claims at issue here.  \nApp. 111-18. \nCompounding that error, the district court concluded that the \nDepartment’s discretionary decision regarding which programs should be \nfunded to best achieve its goals was subject to review under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the court second-guessed the \nDepartment’s determinations on that score.  App. 95.  The court further \nmade the remarkable suggestion that the Department had to first engage in \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking to amend a regulation that provided a \nmenu of general considerations that could be considered in future grant \nallocation decisions before conducting the case-by-case determinations of \nwhich programs should be funded.  App. 92-94. \nFinally, the district court granted relief to entities that had not been \nidentified in this lawsuit on the ground that they were members of one of \nthe plaintiff organizations.  App. 106.  In so doing, the court provided \nmultiple bites at the apple for individual funding recipients, and premised \n2 \n\n \nrelief for unnamed entities on irreparable harm ostensibly established by \nothers. \nThe district court’s order contemplates the immediate outlay of \nfederal funds in a manner contrary to the policy interests of the Executive \nBranch.  In light of these exigencies, the government requests a ruling by \nApril 7, 2025.  Plaintiffs oppose this motion. \nSTATEMENT  \n1. This case involves three grant programs implemented by the \nDepartment of Education pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority to \nprepare and develop educators.  The first, known as the Teacher Quality \nPartnership (“TQP”), provides that “the Secretary is authorized to award \ngrants, on a competitive basis, to eligible partnerships, to enable the eligible \npartnerships to carry out” certain activities, including “a program for the \npreparation of teachers,” a “teaching residency program,” and “a \nleadership development program.” 20 U.S.C. § 1022a(a), (c).  The second, \nknown as the Supporting Effective Educator Development (“SEED”), \ngenerally directs the Secretary to “award grants, on a competitive basis, to \neligible entities for” five specified “purposes,” such as “providing \nevidence-based professional development activities” and “making freely \n3 \n\n \navailable services and learning opportunity to local education agencies.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 6672(a).  Finally, the Teacher and School Leader Incentive \nProgram (“TSL”), provides grants to “develop, implement, improve, or \nexpand performance-based compensation systems or human capital \nmanagement systems, in schools.”  20 U.S.C. § 6631(a).  Plaintiffs in this \ncase—or plaintiffs’ members—were selected to receive multiyear TQP \ngrants that began in FY 2020, 2022, and 2024, multiyear SEED grants that \nbegan in FY 2022, and multiyear TSL grants that began in FY 2023.  App. \n63.  \nOn February 5, 2025, the Acting Secretary of Education issued a \nDirective on Department Grant Priorities, which contemplated an internal \nreview to ensure that grants do not fund “discriminatory practices—\nincluding in the form of DEI—that are either contrary to law or to the \nDepartment’s policy objectives, as well as to ensure that all grants are free \nfrom fraud, abuse, and duplication.”  App. 66.  The Department then \nindividually reviewed all awarded grants—including all TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants—by consulting each grant document and available information \nabout the funded program.  The Department concluded that the majority, \nbut not all, of TQP, SEED, and TSL grants should be terminated.  App. 67. \n4 \n\n \nFor each terminated grant, the Department issued a letter stating that \nthe funded programs “promote or take part in DEI initiatives or other \ninitiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, \nsex, national origin, or another protected characteristic;” “violate either the \nletter or purpose of Federal civil rights law;” “conflict with the \nDepartment’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in \neducation;” “are not free from fraud, abuse, or duplication;” or “otherwise \nfail to serve the best interests of the United States.”  App. 67-68.  Citing \nboth “the termination provisions in” the grants and the Department’s \nauthority under “2 C.F.R. § 200.339-43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253,” the letters \nterminated recipients’ grants.  Id. \n2. On March 3, 2025, plaintiffs filed this suit.  Later that day, plaintiffs \nmoved for immediate injunctive relief to remedy what they complained \nwas the “unlawful termination of plaintiffs’ members’ grants.”  Defendants \nsubmitted their response on March 11, 2025, and the district court set a \nhearing for March 13, 2025.  On March 17, 2025, the court granted in part \nand denied in part plaintiffs’ motion. \nAlthough the district court denied plaintiffs’ constitutional claim \nbased on the supposed vagueness of an Executive Order, the court \n5 \n\n \nconcluded that plaintiffs were likely to show the grant terminations \nviolated the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551–559, in three ways.  First, the court \nconcluded that the grant terminations improperly relied upon 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4), which provides that any grant “may be terminated in part \nor its entirety . . . if [it] no longer effectuates the program goals or agency \npriorities,” because the referenced “program goals or agency priorities” \ncould only be modified by notice-and-comment rulemaking.  App. 92-93.  \nAccording to the court, a provision of the General Education Provisions \nAct, 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d), that carves out certain education-related \nregulations from the APA’s blanket exception to notice-and-comment \nrulemaking for grants, 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2), requires the Department to \nengage in rulemaking to change its “agency priorities” before terminating \ngrants pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  App. 92-93. \nSecond, the district court concluded that the grant terminations \nviolated 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, which requires that any “notice of termination \nshould include the reasons for termination,” on the ground that the \ngrantees had not been notified of specific policy violations.  App. 95. \nFinally, the district court concluded that the “Department did not \nprovide the ‘reasonable explanation’ of its final agency action the APA \n6 \n\n \nrequires,” because the termination letters it sent failed to articulate “any \nworkable, sensible, or meaningful reasons for the basis for the \ntermination.”  App. 96.  In particular, the court concluded that the \ntermination letters were “so broad and vague as to be limitless,” failed to \nmention any data or information considered, and did not reflect any \nindividualized consideration.  App. 96-97. \nRegarding the remaining elements for a preliminary injunction, the \ndistrict court found that plaintiffs’ member organization would suffer \nirreparable harm because some members would have to close their \nprograms while others would be forced to lay off staff.  App. 100.  The \ncourt also found the balance of the equities and the public interest favor a \npreliminary injunction because the effect of such an injunction would be to \nrestore the status quo prior to the grant terminations that the court viewed \nas likely violating the APA.  App. 102. \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction that: (1) ordered \nthe Department to reinstate the terminated TQP, SEED, and TSL grants that \nhad been awarded to institutions that were members of the plaintiff \norganizations and (2) enjoined the Department from terminating any TQP, \nSEED, or TSL grant that had been awarded to institutions that were \n7 \n\n \nmembers of the plaintiff organizations.  App. 106-07. \nThe following day, defendants filed an Emergency Motion for \nReconsideration that argued the district court lacked jurisdiction because \nthe Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, vested exclusive jurisdiction with the \nCourt of Federal Claims and because the Department’s decision to \nterminate grants is outside of APA review because it is “committed to \nagency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 702(a)(2).  The court rejected both \narguments on March 19, 2025. \nSpecifically, the district court reasoned that the Tucker Act was \ninapplicable because plaintiffs are “seeking redress for alleged statutory \nand regulatory violations,” not “money damages for past wrongs,” and \nplaintiffs seek “forward-looking equitable relief.”  App. 116.  The court \nconcluded that the determinations were not committed to agency \ndiscretion by law in light of its conclusion that notice-and-comment \nrulemaking was required. \nOn March 20, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to stay and suspend \nthe preliminary injunction pending appeal.  The district court denied the \nmotion the following day, primarily on the basis that it believed its \nprevious opinions were correct.  App. 123-27.     \n8 \n\n \nARGUMENT \nA stay pending appeal is warranted. The government is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of its appeal, the government will face irreparable \ninjury absent a stay, and the balance of equities and public interest support \na stay.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009). \nA. The Government Is Likely to Prevail on the Merits \nThe district court’s conclusion that the Department’s decision to \nterminate the majority, but not all, of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants \nawarded to members of plaintiffs violated the APA is contrary to \nestablished law. \n1.  The district court’s conclusion that it had jurisdiction \nnotwithstanding the express mandate of the Tucker Act was \nincorrect.   \nThe federal government is generally “immune from suit in federal \ncourt absent a clear and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.”  \nCrowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  The \nAPA provides only “a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for claims \nagainst the United States” seeking non-monetary relief, id., that does not \napply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly \nforbids the relief which is sought,” Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of \n9 \n\n \nPottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 215 (2012) (quotation omitted).  \nThat carve-out “prevents plaintiffs from exploiting the APA’s waiver to \nevade limitations on suit contained in other statutes.”  Id.  \nWhen, as relevant to this case, a party seeks to access funding that it \nbelieves the government is obligated to pay under a contract or certain \ngrants, the proper remedy is suit under the Tucker Act in the Court of \nFederal Claims, not under the APA in district court.  The Tucker Act \nprovides that the “United States Court of Federal Claims shall have \njurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States \nfounded” on “any express or implied contract with the United States.”  28 \nU.S.C. § 1491(a).  As the D.C. Circuit has explained, “the Tucker Act \nimpliedly forbids” the bringing of “contract actions” against “the \ngovernment in a federal district court” under the APA.  Albrecht v. \nCommittee on Employee Benefits of the Federal Reserve Employee Benefits Sys., \n357 F.3d 62, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted).  This prohibition \nextends to claims founded on grants, such as those at issue here, that are \nimplemented by “employ[ing] contracts to set the terms of and receive \ncommitments from recipients.”  Boaz Housing Auth. v. United States, 994 \nF.3d 1359, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  The proper recourse for asserted violations \n10 \n\n \nof those grant terms is a “suit in the Claims Court for damages relating to \nan alleged breach.”  Id.  \nIn determining whether “a particular action” is “at its essence a \ncontract action” subject to the Tucker Act or instead a challenge properly \nbrought under the APA, courts have looked at both “the source of the \nrights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims” and “the type of relief \nsought (or appropriate).”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. \nCir. 1982) (quotation omitted); see also, e.g., United States v. J&E Salvage Co., \n55 F.3d 985, 987-88 (4th Cir. 1995) (applying Megapulse).   \nHere, although plaintiffs cite various statutory and regulatory \nprovisions, none of them, even on plaintiffs’ telling, compels the \ngovernment to make payments to plaintiffs.  The only conceivable source of \nthat right is the funding agreements themselves.  Indeed, the core \nregulation authorizing the terminations, 2 C.F.R. § 200.304, is expressly \nincorporated into the grant agreements.  App. 90 n.13.  Those agreements \nare thus “the source of the rights” on which plaintiffs’ claims are based.  \nSimilarly, the relief sought is continued compliance with the government’s \nobligations to make payments under the funding agreement—the “classic \ncontractual remedy of specific performance.”  U.S. Conference of Catholic \n11 \n\n \nBishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 1:25-cv-465, 2025 WL 763738 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, \n2025) (quotation omitted).   \nThe district court acknowledged the relevant legal standard, but cited \nfive reasons why it believed the Tucker Act did not apply.  Each reduces to \nan effort to sidestep the fact that plaintiffs are, at bottom, seeking to enforce \na contractual agreement with the government. \nFirst, although the district court alluded to “alleged statutory and \nregulatory violations,” App. 116, as noted, the cited statutes and \nregulations do not independently require the government to make \npayments to plaintiffs or their members but rather are relevant only insofar \nas they might lend credence to plaintiffs’ argument that the government \nmust continue to make payments pursuant to a contractual agreement.  \nIndeed, compliance with the contractual agreements, and not with the \nrelevant statutes and regulations, is what the court ultimately ordered.  See \nApp. 106-07 (requiring the Department to reinstate the TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants “in accordance with the Grant Award Notification terms and \nconditions in place immediately prior to issuance of Termination Letters by \nthe Department”).  \n12 \n\n \nSecond, third, and fourth, the district court viewed the remedies that \nplaintiffs seek as “forward-looking equitable relief” to “prevent the \nDefendants from terminating other Grant Program awards” and to \neliminate certain conditions on drawing down funds, which were “beyond \nthe narrow circumstances in which the Court of Federal Claims may issue \ninjunctive relief per the Tucker Act.”  App. 116.  Any breach-of-contract \nclaim could be similarly recast as a requirement to continue complying \nwith the terms of the contract.  The court’s reliance on Maine Community \nHealth Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296 (2020), and Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), which did not involve contracts with the \ngovernment at all, highlights the absence of any precedent for an APA \nlawsuit contending that the government has failed to properly terminate a \ncontract.  And the Court of Federal Claims can rarely provide equitable \nrelief, but that merely reflects the fact that specific performance is generally \nunavailable in contract claims against the government, rather than \nproviding a basis for circumventing the exclusive jurisdictional provisions \nof the Tucker Act.  See Albrecht, 357 F.3d at 68 (“We have held that the \nTucker Act impliedly forbids—in APA terms—not only district court \nawards of money damages, which the Claims Court may grant, but also \n13 \n\n \ninjunctive relief, which the Claims Court may not.” (quotation marks \nomitted)). \nFinally, the district court concluded that the fact that it had to \nexamine “the parties’ relationship pursuant to a constellation of sources,” \nincluding statutes and regulations, weighed in favor of this being a proper \nAPA suit.  App. 117.  But the relevant part of this observation was that the \nparties’ relationship, at its core, comes down to a contractual agreement.  \nThe possibility that the contractual arrangement might have incorporated \nvarious statutory or regulatory provisions, as was the case here, App. 90 \nn.13, does not change the fundamental nature of the dispute.  In Spectrum \nLeasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891 (D.C. Cir. 1985), for example, the \nplaintiff alleged that the government had violated the Debt Collection Act, \nbut the court concluded that the claim was impliedly precluded by the \nTucker Act because the plaintiff sought payments and “[t]he right to these \npayments is created in the first instance by the contract, not by the Debt \nCollection Act.”  Id. at 894.  The same analysis applies here.  \n14 \n\n \n2.  The Department’s grant-termination decisions need not be \npredicated on notice-and-comment rulemaking and instead are \ncommitted to agency discretion by law.  \nAlthough the Tucker Act’s preclusion of review is itself dispositive, \nthe district court further erred in adopting an improperly narrow view of \nthe circumstances in which the Department could terminate a grant that \n“no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4).  This well-established provision provides broad—indeed, \nlargely unreviewable—authority for various Executive Branch agencies to \nterminate funding agreements that no longer serve the government’s \ninterests.  The court’s suggestion that it could second-guess these \nconclusions, or that some notice-and-comment rulemaking was required \nbefore the government could exercise this authority, was mistaken. \na. The Supreme Court made clear in Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 \n(1993), that agency decisions like this—to discontinue a previously funded \nprogram to reallocate those funds to more productive uses—is committed \nby law to agency discretion and not reviewable under the APA.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2). \nIn Lincoln, the Supreme Court held that the Indian Health Service’s \ndecision to discontinue a program it had previously funded and to instead \n15 \n\n \nreallocate those funds to other programs was committed to agency \ndiscretion by law and thus not reviewable under the APA’s reasoned-\ndecision-making standards.  See id. at 185-88.  The Court explained that the \n“allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is” an “administrative \ndecision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion,” \nbecause the “very point of a lump-sum appropriation is to give an agency \nthe capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory \nresponsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Id. at \n192.  \nThus, “an agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum \nappropriation requires ‘a complicated balancing of a number of factors \nwhich are peculiarly within its expertise’: whether its ‘resources are best \nspent’ on one program or another; whether it ‘is likely to succeed’ in \nfulfilling its statutory mandate; whether a particular program ‘best fits the \nagency’s overall policies’; and, ‘indeed, whether the agency has enough \nresources’ to fund a program ‘at all.’”  Id. at 193 (quoting Heckler v. Chaney, \n470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985)).  \n“Of course,” the Court went on, this discretion is not unbounded \nbecause “an agency is not free simply to disregard statutory \n16 \n\n \nresponsibilities: Congress may always circumscribe agency discretion to \nallocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative statutes.”  508 \nU.S. at 193.  But as long as the agency abides by the relevant statutes (and \nwhatever self-imposed obligations may arise from regulations or grant \ninstruments), the APA “gives the courts no leave to intrude.”  Id.  \nAlthough Lincoln addressed lump-sum appropriations, courts have \nmade clear that its logic extends to funding programs that leave to the \nagency “the decision about how the moneys” for a particular program \n“could best be distributed consistent with” the statute.  Milk Train, Inc. v. \nVeneman, 310 F.3d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Such decisions—like decisions \nregarding how best to allocate lump-sum appropriations—“clearly \nrequir[e] a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are \npeculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise.”  Id. at 752 (quotation omitted); \nsee also Policy & Research, LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 313 F. \nSupp. 3d 62, 75-76 (D.D.C. 2018). \nThe programs at issue here are just such programs: they provide \nsignificant discretion in determining how best to allocate appropriated \nfunds across grant applicants.  The statute governing TQP grants provides \nsimply that “the Secretary is authorized to award grants, on a competitive \n17 \n\n \nbasis, to eligible partnerships, to enable the eligible partnerships to carry \nout” certain activities, including “a program for the preparation of \nteachers,” a “teaching residency program,” and “a leadership development \nprogram.” 20 U.S.C. § 1022a(a), (c).  Similarly, the SEED grant statute \ngenerally directs the Secretary to “award grants, on a competitive basis, to \neligible entities for” five specified “purposes,” such as “providing \nevidence-based professional development activities” and “making freely \navailable services and learning opportunity to local educational agencies.” \nId. § 6672(a).  The TSL grant statute follows this pattern, and also generally \ndirects the Secretary to “award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible \nentities to enable the eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or \nexpand performance-based compensation systems or human capital \nmanagement systems.”  Id. § 6632(a). \nNone of these statutes constrains the Department’s discretion to \ndetermine how best to allocate the funding for each program among many \ndifferent potential grant recipients.  As a result, there is no meaningful \nstandard for a court to apply in reviewing the Department’s exercise of its \nbroad discretion within the outer bounds of those “permissible statutory \nobjectives.”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193.  Thus, the Department’s decision to \n18 \n\n \naward or terminate a grant is reviewable—at most, and in an appropriate \nforum—only for compliance with the terms of the governing statutes, \nregulations, and funding instruments.   \nb. The district court’s contrary conclusion was premised on a \nprovision that limits the circumstances in which the Department of \nEducation can forgo notice-and-comment procedures when promulgating \nregulations relating to grants.  See App. 92-03 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)).  \nThat provision has no evident relevance here.  The Department neither \npromulgated a new regulation—with or without notice and comment—nor \naccused grant recipients of failing to comply with a new policy with the \nforce of law that would need to be codified in a regulation.  Instead, it \nrelied upon an existing regulation that gave it broad authority to terminate \ngrants that it no longer considers certain funding agreements to be effective \nin carrying out the Department’s broader goals.  See 2 C.F.R. § 3474.1 \n(adopting 2 C.F.R. § 200.340). \nThe regulation the district court viewed as restricting the \nDepartment’s discretion was one that set forth a list of priorities and \ndefinitions that “may be used across the [Department’s] discretionary grant \nprograms to further the Department’s mission.”  86 Fed. Reg. 70612, 70612 \n19 \n\n \n(Dec. 10, 2021).  In a given grant program, “[t]he Secretary may choose to \nuse an entire priority . . . or use one or more of the priority’s subparts.”  Id.  \nThis lays out a permissible set of criteria that can be used to allocate \nresources going forward, but does not purport to limit the Department’s \ndiscretion in terminating grants.  Much less do the regulations purport to \nprovide an exhaustive list of considerations that might come into play in \ndetermining whether a particular funding agreement is ineffectual or \ncounterproductive.   \nOne would expect a much clearer indication than the shared use of \nthe broad term “priorities” to convert a Department of Education \nregulation that, on its face, represents a broad menu of priorities upon \nwhich future grant programs might be premised into a limitation on the \nDepartment’s ability to exercise its separate authority, arising from \nExecutive Branch-wide regulations, to terminate a funding agreement \nwhen it “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  In addition, the Department’s view that certain types \nof programs do not “effectuat[e] the program goals,” id., because they are \nineffective or counterproductive has little to do with the announced \npriorities.  In short, the regulations allow the Department to terminate \n20 \n\n \nfunding agreements to maintain flexibility in spending taxpayer dollars in \nthe way the Executive Branch sees fit, and do not require compliance with a \nseparate set of broad principles from which the agency may select in \ncreating future grant programs.  85 Fed. Reg. 49506, 49508 (Aug. 13, 2020) \n(rejecting requests to limit Section 200.340(a)(4) to terminations “for cause,” \nand explaining the provision was intended to allow termination where it \n“may be in the interest of the government to terminate the Federal award”). \n3.  In any event, the grant terminations did not violate the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard.  \nEven if the Department’s discretionary decisions were subject to \nreview, they would be upheld under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, \nwhich “requires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably \nexplained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  \n“Judicial review under that standard is deferential, and a court may not \nsubstitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.” Id. \nAs explained, those terminations came after the Department \nconducted an individualized review pursuant to the Acting Secretary’s \ndirective to identify grants that fund programs that are contrary to the \nDepartment’s policy priorities.  App. 97-99.  The Department confirmed \n21 \n\n \nthat the grants at issue here in fact funded such programs and terminated \nthose grants on that basis.  App. 98-99.  This decision-making process was \nboth reasonable and reasonably explained, particularly in this context of \ndiscretionary grants where the Department is vested with substantial \ndiscretion. \nThe district court purported to identify a lack of clarity in the \ntermination letters, but each identified “DEI initiatives” that conflict with \nthe Department’s current policies as the root cause of the termination.  See \nApp. 89.  The possibility that individual programs might be unlawful, \nviolate the purpose of federal law, suffer other policy defects, or some \ncombination does not obscure the clear thrust of the letter as targeted at \nDEI programs that the Department did not wish to continue funding.  No \nfurther explanation is required. \nThe district court further faulted the Department for sending \ntemplate letters and for not engaging in any “individualized analysis.”  \nApp. 97.  But the Department in fact engaged in individualized review, a \nfact the court summarily dismissed as a “post-hoc rationalization,” App. \n98—even though that review occurred before the grants were terminated—\napparently because the Department’s description of that process was \n22 \n\n \ncontained in a declaration filed in litigation challenging the terminations.  \nBut see Roe v. Department of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 221 (4th Cir. 2020) (allowing \npost-hoc declarations that are “merely explanatory of the original record \nand contain no new rationalizations” (quotation and alteration omitted)); \nLana, Inc. v. United States, 925 F.3d 521, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (explaining that \ncourts may consider such post hoc declarations when they “accurately \nreflect[] the contemporaneous reasoning of the” agency).  The court also \nglossed over the fact the Department did not terminate all grants held by \nmembers of plaintiffs’ organizations, confirming that review was \nindividualized.  App. 67.  And because the Department identified grants \nwith a common characteristic (funding DEI) and terminated the grants on \nthat basis, the Department reasonably provided a common explanation to \ngrantees.  Indeed, treating similarly situated grants equally honors the \nAPA, for “[r]easoned decisionmaking requires treating like cases alike.”  \nHall v. McLaughlin, 864 F.2d 868, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989).   \nB. The Equitable Factors Favor a Stay Pending Appeal \nThe balance of equities and the public interest favor a stay pending \nappeal.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 435 (noting that these factors merge in cases \ninvolving the government).  In particular, the district court’s order will \n23 \n\n \ncause significant and irreparable harm to the government.  Beyond the \nobvious harms to the President’s ability to execute core Executive Branch \npolicies, the order irreparably harms the public fisc.  The order requires the \nDepartment to reinstate access of grantees to TQP, SEED, and TSL funds, \nand enjoins the Department from re-terminating the grants or even \nimposing any additional payment protections, such as requiring pre-\napproval for grant payments.  App. 106.  Thus, the challenged order will \nresult in the immediate outflow of significant amounts of money from the \nfederal fisc with minimal oversight.  And once that horse has left the barn, \nthe government has a limited ability to recoup those dollars, even if it is \nlater determined that the grant terminations were lawful and the barn \ndoors are closed in the future.  Indeed, the grant recipients here claim they \nwill immediately spend any grant money they receive on operational costs, \nApp. 100, which makes the prospect of the government ever recovering any \nimproperly disbursed funds even more remote. \nIn contrast, the gravamen of plaintiffs’ claim is monetary and, if they \nprevail, they will receive funds to the extent required by law.  Dennis \nMelancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 279 (5th Cir. 2012) (the \n“possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be \n24 \n\n \navailable at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation, [weighs] \nheavily against a claim of irreparable harm”) (citation omitted), cert. denied, \n569 U.S. 994 (2013).  Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in receiving \nfederal funds to which they are not legally entitled or on a timeline that is \nnot legally compelled.   \nC. The District Court’s Order Is Overbroad \nEven accepting the district court’s conclusions, the court’s order is \noverbroad because it extends to all “TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards of \nPlaintiff NCTR and Plaintiffs’ Grant Recipient members.”  App. 106.  In so \ndoing, the order is not limited to the specific grants and grant recipients \nidentified in the Complaint.  App. 20-33.  That order leads to a \nfundamentally inequitable situation in which unidentified members of the \norganization can obtain relief if plaintiffs prevail but may not be precluded \nfrom obtaining relief separately if the government prevails.  Cf. Arizona v. \nBiden, 40 F.4th 375, 397 (6th Cir. 2022) (explaining the equitable and \nhistorical problems with “asymmetric” suits).  These concerns are \nheightened in this case, where there is a separate set of ostensibly \nrepresentative plaintiffs seeking overlapping remedies in another case.  \n25 \n\n \nState of California, et al. v. U.S. Department of Education, et al., No. 25-10548-\nMJJ (D. Mass.). \nFinally, there is no basis to conclude that irreparable harm, a \nnecessary predicate for a preliminary injunction, would be suffered by \nunnamed grant recipients.  Here, the district court relied upon individual \ndeclarations by grant recipients that they would suffer “programmatic \nclosures” and “staff terminations” as a basis for its finding of irreparable \nharm.  App. 99.  There is obviously no such evidence concerning unnamed \ngrant recipients, even if they are members of the Plaintiff organizations.  As \nsuch, there is no basis to conclude a preliminary injunction is appropriate \nfor those unnamed grant recipients.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S.7, 22 (1980) (A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \n“demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction.” (emphasis in original)). \n \n   \n26 \n\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant a stay pending \nappeal or, at a minimum, limit the district court’s relief. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

Many of Plaintiffs’ members received grants \nfrom the Department through the Teacher Quality Partnership Program (“TQP”), the Supporting \nEffective  Educator  Development  Program  (“SEED”),  and  the  Teacher  and  School  Leader \nIncentive Program (“TSL”), which were used to fund programs to prepare and develop educators. \nWithout prior warning, and in reliance on the President’s recent Executive Order regarding DEI \ninitiatives,  the  Department  of  Education  recently  summarily  terminated  many  of  Plaintiffs’ \nmembers’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants. Not only were those terminations unlawful in reliance on \nExecutive Order 14151, the Department also failed to follow statute and Federal regulations in \nterminating the grants, making the terminations unlawful under the Administrative Procedures Act \ntoo. \nIn the years that the Department of Education held competitions to award TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants, the Department selected Priorities for applicants from a set of allowable agency \nPriorities enacted through a rulemaking process required by statute. These Priorities were used in \nthe competitions to award TQP, SEED, and TSL grants to AACTE’s and MACTE’s member \norganizations and to NCTR and its member organizations. Pursuant to statute and Department \n2 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 3 of 39\nregulation, Priorities for any competitive grant program must generally be set by Congress or \nthrough notice and comment rulemaking by the Department.1 Only then can the final published \nagency Priorities apply to the competitive grant programs for selection of grantees in a particular \nfiscal year.  \nIn compliance with statute and its regulation, the Department followed the notice and \ncomment rulemaking process and established several Priorities that were allowable at the time the \nTQP, SEED, and TSL grants’ Notices for Inviting Applications at issue in this case were published \nin the Federal Register in 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The Department then awarded AACTE’s \nand MACTE’s member organizations and NCTR and its member organizations up to five-year \nTQP grants, up to three-year SEED grants, and/or up to three-year TSL grants that remained active \nthrough early to mid-February 2025. \nBut in February 2025, the Department summarily terminated grants awarded under TQP, \nSEED, and TSL. The purported basis provided by the Department for termination was that the \ngrants are “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], Department priorities.” In form letters \nsent along with the official termination notifications, the Department explained that:  \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education….the grant specified above provides \nfunding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives or \nother initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, \n1 While there are limited exceptions to this general rule, none of those exceptions are applicable here. \n3 \nAPPENDIX Page 3\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 4 of 39\n \n \ncolor,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another  protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil \nrights law; that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing \nmerit, fairness, and excellence in education; that are not free from \nfraud, abuse, or duplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best \ninterests of the United States. The grant is therefore inconsistent \nwith, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities. \n \nAfter terminating AACTE’s and MATCE’s member organizations’ and NCTR’s and its \nmember organizations’ TQP and SEED grants, the Department issued a press release titled “U.S. \nDepartment of Education Cuts $600 Million in Grants Used to Train Teachers and Education \nAgencies  on  Divisive  Ideologies.”  See  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-\ndepartment-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-divisive-teacher-training-grants.  \nNeither the Department’s “official” reason for terminating the grants, as articulated in the \nGrant Award Notifications regarding Department Priorities, nor its actual, publicly-articulated \nreason for termination regarding DEI initiatives, were lawful. The “official” justification is \nunlawful because the federal government has published a regulation governing the termination of \ngrants that the Department did not follow here. The Department’s publicly articulated reason for \nterminating the grants was unlawful because it was predicated on portions of an Executive Order \nthat has been enjoined by this Court.  \nThe Department’s stated reason relied, erroneously, on an implied change in “Department \npriorities.” Department Priorities,” however, is a term of art; they are not subject to whim or fiat \nand,  by  statute,  must  instead  be  established  through  notice  and  comment  rulemaking.  The \nDepartment Priorities applicable to Plaintiffs’ members’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants are the same \ntoday as they were when the grants were awarded because (a) no subsequent rulemaking has taken \nplace; and (b) the statutes that established Priorities allowable for TQP, SEED, and TSL have not \nbeen repealed or amended. Given that the Department Priorities have not changed, and the grants \n4 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 5 of 39\n \n \nwere determined to meet the still-current Priorities during the competition process, it would be \narbitrary per se for the Department to conclude that these grants are not consistent with or do not \neffectuate those same “Department Priorities” now. \nAs a result of the Department’s improper early terminations, the Grant Recipients have \nbeen and will continue to be deprived of essential funding required to continue their teacher \npreparation  programs  and  the  continuation  of  the  Department’s  unlawful  terminations  will \nirreparably harm Plaintiffs and their members. As such, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nCourt award relief to address the irreparable harm that continues to result from Defendants’ \nunlawful actions.  \nIn support of their claims, Plaintiffs further aver as follows: \n1.  The Supporting Effective Educator Development Program, authorized by Congress \nunder section 2242 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 \nU.S.C. § 6672), provides funding to increase the number of highly effective educators in the United \nStates by supporting the implementation of evidence-based practices that prepare, develop, or \nenhance the skills of educators. SEED was authorized in statute to support educators’ development \nacross the continuum of their careers and requires the Secretary of the Department of Education to \naward grants to eligible entities for the purpose of:  \n(1) providing teachers, principals, or other school leaders from nontraditional \npreparation  and  certification  routes  or  pathways  to  serve  in  traditionally \nunderserved local educational agencies; \n \n(2)  providing  evidence-based  professional  development  activities  that  address \nliteracy, numeracy, remedial, or other needs of local educational agencies and the \nstudents the agencies serve; \n \n(3)  providing  teachers,  principals,  or  other  school  leaders  with  professional \ndevelopment activities that enhance or enable the provision of postsecondary \ncoursework through dual or concurrent enrollment programs and early college high \nschool settings across a local educational agency; \n5 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 6 of 39\n \n \n \n(4) making freely available services and learning opportunities to local educational \nagencies,  through  partnerships  and  cooperative  agreements  or  by  making  the \nservices or opportunities publicly accessible through electronic means; or \n \n(5) providing teachers, principals, or other school leaders with evidence-based \nprofessional enhancement activities, which may include activities that lead to an \nadvanced credential. \n20 U.S.C. § 6672(a). \n2.  The Teacher Quality Partnership Grant Program, authorized by section 202 of the \nHigher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 1022), provides funding to eligible \npartnerships to improve student achievement; improve the quality of prospective and new teachers \nby improving the preparation of prospective teachers and enhancing professional development \nactivities for new teachers; hold teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education \naccountable  for  preparing  teachers  who  meet  applicable  State  certification  and  licensure \nrequirements;  and  recruit  highly  qualified  individuals,  including  individuals  of  color  and \nindividuals from other occupations, into the teaching force. TQP funds teacher preparation \nprograms at the pre-baccalaureate or “fifth-year” level, and teaching residency programs for \nindividuals new to teaching, or mid-career professionals from outside the field of education, with \nstrong academic and professional backgrounds.  \n3.  The Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program, authorized by section 2212 of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 6632), serves \neducators in high-need schools who raise student academic achievement and close the achievement \ngap between high- and low-performing students. TSL helps develop, implement, improve, or \nexpand comprehensive performance-based compensation systems or human capital management \nsystems for teachers, principals, or other school leaders. \n6 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 7 of 39\n \n \n4.  Plaintiff AACTE’s and MACTE’s member organizations and Plaintiff NCTR and \nits member organizations (the “Grant Recipients”) receive TQP, SEED, and/or TSL funding \nthrough grants awarded by the Department of Education. Specifically, the Grant Recipients were \nawarded up to five-year TQP grants through the FY 2020 TQP competition, FY 2022 TQP \ncompetition, and FY 2024 TQP competition, up to three-year SEED grants through the FY 2022 \nSEED competition, and up to three-year TSL grants though the FY 2023 TSL competition.  \n5.  In February 2025, the majority of the Grant Recipients received updated Grant \nAward Notifications and form letters from the Department (“Termination Letters”) terminating \ntheir TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.2 True and correct representative copies of the Grant Award \nNotifications are attached as Exhibit A. True and correct representative copies of the Termination \nLetters are attached as Exhibit B.  \n6.  All of the Grant Recipients are similarly situated because the substance of each \nTermination Letter and added terms and conditions in the Grant Award Notifications from the \nDepartment are identical, indicating the same reasons with the same terminology for the grant \nterminations. See Exhibits A, B. \n7.  In terminating the Grant Recipients’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants in their entirety, \neffective the same day as the termination letters were sent/dated, the updated Grant Award \nNotifications  provided  the  following  reason  for  termination:  “The  grant  is  deemed  to  be \ninconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.” (Exhibit A at pages 4, 10, 16, \n22, 28, 34, 40). The Termination Letter articulated the same reason along with additional language \nregarding DEI initiatives: \nThe grant specified above provides funding for programs that promote or \ntake part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate \n \n2 While the Department terminated the majority of the Grant Recipients’ grants, some of Plaintiffs’ member \norganizations did not have their TQP grants terminated yet.  \n7 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 7\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 8 of 39\n \n \non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights \nlaw;  that  conflict  with  the  Department’s  policy  of  prioritizing  merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United \nStates.  The  grant  is  therefore  inconsistent  with,  and  no  longer \neffectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see also \n34 C.F.R. § 75.253. Therefore, pursuant to, among other authorities, 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.339-43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the termination provisions in \nyour grant award, the Department hereby terminates grant No. [] in its \nentirety effective 2/[]/25. \nExhibit B at pages 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 (emphasis added). \n8.  The Department’s articulated basis for terminating the grants and denying access \nto the funds is contrary to statute and regulations, and the immediate termination constitutes final \nagency action that is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”). \n9.  The Grant Recipients offer programs to provide supports to improve the quality of \nteaching and school leadership. The unlawful termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants will \nforce the immediate closure of many of these programs and irreparably harm the Grant Recipients \nand the educators, students, and communities they serve. Plaintiffs thus bring this action to enjoin \nDefendants from terminating the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the claims arise \nunder  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and because \nDefendants are United States officials, see 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). This Court may issue a \ndeclaratory judgment and further relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.  \n11.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), (e)(1), because \nDefendants are agencies of the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official \n8 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 8\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 9 of 39\n \n \ncapacity, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this \nDistrict, and Plaintiff MACTE resides in this district. \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education is a nonprofit \nassociation of educator preparation programs, comprised of hundreds of public and private \ncolleges and universities and nonprofit organizations.3 AACTE’s member organizations prepare \nprofessional  educators  across  the  United  States  and  its  territories,  encompassing  teachers, \ncounselors, PK-12 administrators, and college faculty. AACTE’s mission is to elevate education \nand educator preparation through research, professional practice, advocacy, and collaboration. The \ntermination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants directly threatens this mission. These grants fund \ninitiatives  that  benefit  PK-12  students  and  schools  nationwide  by  supporting  innovative \napproaches to educator preparation and professional development. Through their work, grantees \nproduce  evidence-based  practices  that  lead  to  the  preparation  of  highly  qualified  teachers, \nprincipals, and school-based educators. As the nation’s largest organization dedicated to educator \npreparation, AACTE prioritizes ensuring that every child has access to credentialed, well-prepared \neducators. These grants are vital to that goal. AACTE plays a crucial role in amplifying their \nimpact by sharing grantees’ research, policy insights, and best practices with the broader education \ncommunity through publications, convenings, annual meetings, and other resources. Preserving \nthese funding sources is essential to sustaining and advancing the quality of educator preparation \nand, ultimately, student success. AACTE’s principal place of business is 1602 L St., NW, Suite \n601, Washington, DC 20036. \n \n3 AACTE’s member organizations can be found at https://aacte.org/membership/our-members/.  \n9 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 9\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 10 of 39\n \n \n13.  Plaintiff The National Center for Teacher Residencies supports the design of new \nteacher residency programs and provides consulting to strengthen existing programs across the \nUnited States. NCTR is comprised of dozens of network members, including colleges, universities, \nand nonprofit teaching organizations.4 NCTR’s mission is to transform educator preparation by \nadvancing the teacher residency movement to prepare, support, and retain more effective educators \nwho represent and value the communities they serve. The termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL \ngrants implicates NCTR’s core mission because it removes the financial supports needed to reduce \ntuition costs for aspiring teachers called teacher residents, pay host K-12 teachers for the work \nthey are doing to support the aspiring teachers, offset the cost for licensure examinations and test \nprep workshops, and provide a stipend or pay for work the teacher residents are completing through \ntheir internships. Without these necessary supports, teacher residencies will be unable to continue \nto lower the financial barrier to becoming a teacher and ensure the necessary comprehensive \npreparation is provided to prepare future teachers. NCTR’s principal place of business is 1332 N. \nHalsted Street, Suite 304 Chicago, IL 60642. \n14.

In 2008, Congress authorized TQP to support high-quality teacher preparation and \nprofessional  development  for  prospective  teachers  and  school  leaders.  In  2015,  Congress \nauthorized  SEED  to  increase  the  number  of  highly  effective  educators  by  supporting  the \nimplementation  of  evidence-based  practices  that  prepare,  develop,  or  enhance  the  skills  of \nteachers, principals, or other school leaders. Also in 2015, Congress authorized TSL to assist local \neducational agencies and nonprofit organizations to develop, implement, improve, or expand \ncomprehensive performance-based compensation systems or human capital management systems \n11 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 11\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 12 of 39\n \n \nfor teachers, principals, or other school leaders, especially for teachers, principals, or other school \nleaders in high-need schools who raise student growth and academic achievement and close the \nachievement gap between high- and low-performing students. \n19.  Congress directed the Secretary of the Department of Education to award grants, \non a competitive basis, to eligible entities to provide funding consistent with the goals of TQP (20 \nU.S.C. § 1022a(a)), SEED (20 U.S.C. § 6672(a)), and TSL (20 U.S.C. § 6632(a)).  \n20.  Federal regulations govern the procedures and the basis by which a Federal agency, \nsuch as the Department of Education, may terminate a Federal award. See 85 F.R. 49506-49582. \nA Federal award may be terminated by the Federal agency or pass-through entity if an award no \nlonger effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2) (2020); see \nalso 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (2024).  \n21.  The  Secretary  of  Education  (the  “Secretary”)  is  required  to  publish  agency \nPriorities in the Federal Register, which must be used to select the Priorities for a competition and \nmust have gone through public comment, unless one of the following exceptions apply:  \n(i) The final annual priorities will be implemented only by inviting applications that \nmeet the priorities; \n \n(ii) The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of priorities already established \nin the program’s regulations; \n \n(iii) Publishing proposed annual priorities would seriously interfere with an orderly, \nresponsible grant award process or would otherwise be impracticable, unnecessary, \nor contrary to the public interest; \n \n(iv) The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to establish specified \npriorities; or \n \n(v) The annual priorities are chosen from allowable activities specified in the \nprogram statute. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2); 20 USC § 1232(d).  \n12 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 12\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 13 of 39\n \n \n22.  The Secretary is likewise required to establish the specific Priorities that are \nincluded in the application for each competitive federal grant program, such as TQP, SEED, and \nTSL, by publishing the Priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal \nRegister. (34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1)).  \n23.  As a federal agency, the Department is unique in the statutory requirement it has to \nfollow for setting agency Priorities for discretionary grants. While the APA (5 U.S.C. § 553) \nexempts grants from the rulemaking process, the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(d)) (“GEPA”) states that, for the Department of Education, the grants exemption for \nrulemaking only applies to regulations (1) that govern the first grant competition under a new or \nsubstantially revised program authority as determined by the Secretary; or (2) where the Secretary \ndetermines rulemaking will cause extreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries of the program. \n24.  In other words, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department \nmust go through the notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the above exceptions \napply.  \nII.  Department of Education Priorities Applicable to the Now-Terminated TQP, SEED, \nand TSL Grants. \n25.  After  going  through  the  proper  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  process,  the \nDepartment published a Notice of Final Priority for discretionary grant programs in the Federal \nRegister on November 27, 2019. (84 F.R. 65300-65303).5 Also after following the required notice \nand comment rulemaking process, the Department published a Notice of Final Priorities for all \ndiscretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020.6 (85 F.R. 13640-13644). \n \n5 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on July 29, \n2019. (84 F.R. 36504-36507). \n \n6 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on November \n29, 2019. (84 F.R. 65734-65739). \n13 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 13\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 14 of 39\n \n \n26.  Then, after going through the proper notice and comment rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published its Notice of Final Priorities for TQP, SEED, and TSL grant competitions \nin the Federal Register on July 9, 2021.7 The final Priorities consisted of: Priority 1—Supporting \nEducators and Their Professional Growth; and Priority 2—Increasing Educator Diversity. (86 F.R. \n36217-36220). \n27.  On July 9, 2021, after going through the proper notice and comment rulemaking \nprocess, the Department published a Notice of Final Priority for TSL.8 The Priority was for “High-\nNeed Schools.” (86 F.R. 36220-36222). \n28.  After  following  the  required  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  process,  the \nDepartment of Education published a Notice of Final Priorities for the Secretary’s Supplemental \nPriorities for all discretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on December 10, 2021.9 The \nfinal supplemental Priorities consisted of the following: Priority 1—Addressing the Impact of \nCOVID-19 on Students, Educators, and Faculty; Priority 2—Promoting Equity in Student Access \nto  Educational  Resources  and  Opportunities;  Priority  3—Supporting  a  Diverse  Educator \nWorkforce and Professional Growth To Strengthen Student Learning; Priority 4—Meeting Student \nSocial, Emotional, and Academic Needs; Priority 5—Increasing Postsecondary Education Access, \nAffordability, Completion, and Post-Enrollment Success; and Priority 6—Strengthening Cross-\nAgency Coordination and Community Engagement To Advance Systemic Change. (86 F.R. \n70612-70641).  \n \n7 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on April 20, \n2021. (86 F.R. 20471-20475). \n \n8 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priority for public comment on April 9, \n2021. (86 F.R. 18519-18523). \n \n9 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on June 30, \n2021. (86 F.R. 34664-34674). \n14 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 14\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 15 of 39\n \n \nIII.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2020, FY 2022, and FY 2024 TQP Grants.  \n29.  On May 18, 2020, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the \nFY 2020 TQP competition inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (85 F.R. 29691-29704). \nIn addition, on February 25, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for \nthe FY 2022 TQP competition inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (87 F.R. 10906-\n10923). The Department similarly published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2024 TQP \ncompetition on April 4, 2024. (89 F.R. 23573-23592). \n30.  The project period for the FY 2020, FY 2022, and FY 2024 TQP competitions (the \nmaximum amount of time for which the grants can be awarded) was up to five years. (85 F.R. \n29699, 87 F.R. 10918, 89 F.R. 23587). \n31.  All three TQP grant competitions included Priorities that were established through \nthe required notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified \nin TQP’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 1022).  \n32.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2020  TQP \ncompetition for up to a five-year period. \n33.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2022  TQP \ncompetition for up to a five-year period. \n34.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2024  TQP \ncompetition for up to a five-year period.  \nIV.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2022 SEED Grants.  \n35.   On April 4, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the \nFY 2022 SEED competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (87 F.R. 19487-\n19496).  \n15 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 15\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 16 of 39\n \n \n36.  The project period for the FY 2022 SEED competition was up to three years. (87 \nF.R. 19492). \n37.  The SEED grant competition included Priorities that were established through the \nrequired notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified in \nSEED’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 6672). \n38.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2022  SEED \ncompetition for up to a three-year period.  \nV.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2023 TSL Grants.  \n39.   On May 24, 2023, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the \nFY 2023 TSL competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (88 F.R. 33592-33601).  \n40.  The project period for the FY 2023 TSL competition was up to three years. (88 F.R. \n33598). \n41.  The TSL grant competition included Priorities that were established through the \nrequired notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified in \nTSL’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 6632). \n42.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2023  TSL \ncompetition for up to a three-year period.  \nVI.  The Department’s Decision to Terminate the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \n43.  In February 2025, the Department sent Termination Letters and updated Grant \nAward Notifications to Grant Recipients, informing them that their TQP, SEED, and TSL grants \nwere terminated. The termination of the grants was effective “in [their] entirety” immediately. See \nExhibits A, B. \n44.  The  only  stated  reason  for  the  termination  of  the  grants  was  that  they  are \n“inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], the Department priorities.” See id. \n16 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 16\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 17 of 39\n \n \nVII.  The Preliminary Injunction Granted in NADOHE et al. v. Trump et al. Prohibits the \nDepartment from Enforcing the Termination of the Grants. \n45.  On February 21, 2025, this Court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the \nPresident’s administration from enforcing certain provisions of Executive Order 14151, Ending \nRadical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, Executive Order of January \n20, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) (the “J20 Order”), and Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, Executive Order of January 21, \n2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (“J21 Order”). National Association of Diversity Officers \nin Higher Education, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 \n(D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025) (the “NADOHE Order”). A true and correct copy of the NADOHE Order \nis attached as Exhibit C. \n46.  In relevant part, the NADOHE Order enjoins the President’s administration from \nenforcing a provision in Executive Order 14151 requiring “[e]ach agency, department, . . . [to] \ntake the following actions within sixty days of this order: (i) terminate, to the maximum extent \nallowed by law, . . . all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts” (the “Termination Provision”).  \n47.  In granting the preliminary injunction, the Court held that the plaintiffs showed a \nlikelihood of success on their claim that the Termination Provision is void for vagueness under the \nFifth Amendment. \n48.  While the Grant Award Notification and Termination Letters did not reference \nExecutive Order 14151 as the reason for terminating the grants, the Department released a press \nrelease on February 17, 2025 that makes clear that the grant terminations at issue in this lawsuit \nwere pursuant to the Termination Provision in Executive Order 14151 requiring the Department \nto terminate “equity-related” grants or contracts. A true and correct copy of the press release is \n17 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 17\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 18 of 39\n \n \nattached as Exhibit D.10 The press release explains that the grants were terminated because they \nwere using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education agencies on divisive ideologies, such as \n“Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and “equity training”– the same directive of the Termination \nProvision. See id.  \n49.  The Termination Letters likewise reference the Department’s position to “ensure[] \nthat the Department’s grants do not support programs or organizations that promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives[.]” (Exhibit B at pages 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13).  \n50.  While the Grant Award Notifications and Termination Letters state that the grants \nwere terminated because they were “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], Department \npriorities,” it is clear from the Government’s conduct that the grants were terminated pursuant to \nthe now-enjoined Termination Provision. \n51.  The NADOHE Order benefits not just the named plaintiffs in that action, but all \ncontractors and grantees who were subjected to the Termination Provision. NADOHE v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 at *28-29.  \n52.  As  such,  this  Court’s  NADOHE  Order  covers,  and  forbids,  the  continued \nenforcement of the termination of the grants at issue in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek relief directing \nthe Department to return the Grant Awardees to the status quo ante with respect to Executive Order \n14151 and rescind the termination of their TQP, SEED, and TSL grants. \n \n10  See  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-\ndivisive-teacher-training-grants. \n18 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 18\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 19 of 39\n \n \nVIII.  The  Department’s  Termination  of  the  Grants  also  Violates  the  Administrative \nProcedures Act (“APA”). \n \n53.  Even if the Department’s termination of the grants at issue in this lawsuit were not \ngoverned by the NADOHE Order, the terminations were unlawful because they constituted an \nunlawful, arbitrary, and capricious action that violates the APA. \n54.  Statute and regulation require the Secretary to publish Department Priorities for \nprogram grants in the Federal Register, subject to a notice and comment period. (20 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(d), 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2)). The Secretary then selects allowable Priorities to include in \nthe applications which are published in the Federal Register. (34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)). \n55.  The proffered reason by the Department for the termination of the grants because \nthey “are inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities,” is contrary to statute \nand regulation and arbitrary and capricious.  \n56.  The Department cannot, by law, determine that with a change in administration, \nspecific Department Priorities for grant programs are no longer allowable unless and until the \nDepartment  engages  in  rulemaking  to  propose  and  issue  new  Final  Priorities.  The  present \nadministration has not done that, so the current Priorities remain Department Priorities. \n57.  The Department Priorities for the grants that were awarded from the respective \ncompetitions  were  lawfully  selected  for,  and  articulated  in,  the  published  Notices  Inviting \nApplications in 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024 pursuant to program statutes or after the proper notice \nand comment rulemaking process.  \n58.  As a result, and contrary to the Department’s official reasons, the grants at issue are \nconsistent with the current Department Priorities. If the Department wishes to establish new \nDepartment Priorities, it may do so only through the means established by statute and regulation, \nnot through whim or fiat.  \n19 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 19\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 20 of 39\n \n \nIX.  Effect of Termination on Plaintiffs and Their Member Organizations. \n59.  As of the date of the Termination Letters, all funding from the grants has been \nhalted and the Grant Recipients are no longer receiving any funds from the Department under the \ngrants they were awarded under TQP, SEED, and TSL.  \n60.  Without the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants, Grant Recipients are unable to continue \nfunding their work.  \n61.  The loss of funding is an economic harm so great that it threatens the very existence \nof Plaintiffs’ members’ teacher preparation programs. \n62.  The TQP, SEED, and TSL grants together fund hundreds of teacher preparation \nprograms in the United States, and the termination en masse of these grants threatens the system \nthat prepares our nation’s teaching workforce.  \n63.  The harm to Plaintiffs and their member organizations from the terminations has \nbeen severe, and a continuation of the harm is certain and irreparable. \n64.  The following represent just a few of many examples of the harm to Plaintiffs and \ntheir member organizations caused by the Department’s termination of the Grant Recipients’ TQP, \nSEED, and TSL grants: \nA.  Plaintiff NCTR  \n65.  Plaintiff NCTR has been and will continue to be substantially and irreparably \nharmed by the Department’s grant terminations. Plaintiff NCTR was awarded a three-year SEED \ngrant in 2022. \n66.  NCTR’s SEED grant funded thirteen teacher residency programs spanning five \nstates.  The  teacher  residency  programs  consist  of  partnerships  between  higher  education \n20 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 20\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 21 of 39\n \n \ninstitutions and K-12 school districts in traditional public and charter schools located in rural, \nsuburban, and urban areas.  \n67.  The teacher residency programs provide financial support to their participants in \nthe following ways: tuition support, living expense stipends, tutoring in licensing examinations, \nand emergency funds. The programs also provide mentorship, intensive training and professional \ndevelopment, and summer institutes for mentor teachers.  \n68.  Plaintiff NCTR’s SEED grant is also used to fund a cross-organizational (twelve \nresidency programs) collaborative effort to create and field-test a coherent and aligned vision of \nmentoring excellence and collective responsibility. One of the goals of the grant funds was to \ncomplete a study of attainable metrics to evaluate mentor teacher impacts on resident learning.  \n69.  Plaintiff NCTR’s SEED grant was terminated in its third year.  \n70.  The  termination  of  the  SEED  grant  will  result  in  a  $1,188,070  overall  loss, \nincluding a $332,000 direct loss to the grant winning organization, as well as a loss of $360,000 \nin expenses to contractors and a $495,000 loss in subgrants to the thirteen teacher residency \nprograms. \n71.  This $495,000 loss in subgrants will have an adverse impact on the thirteen teacher \nresidency programs, and will directly lead to staff cuts at a number of those institutions. In addition, \nthe grant termination directly affects the 128 teacher residents currently enrolled in the thirteen \nprograms as part of the 2024-25 school year and will also impact the ability of those thirteen \nprograms to enroll the projected 190 teacher residents who plan to begin their residency year this \nsummer 2025. With the termination of the grant, some of the thirteen teacher residency programs \nwill be forced to close. \n21 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 21\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 22 of 39\n \n \n72.  Programs intended to use subgrant funds to provide tuition relief and stipends for \nboth groups of teacher residents, which would total over 300 teacher residents. This will no longer \nbe possible with the termination of the grant. \n73.  The termination of the grant will also directly affect at least 7,500 K-12 students \nacross the five states.  \n74.  In addition, with the grant’s termination, the study of the mentor teacher impact and \nteacher resident learning will not be completed, depriving Plaintiff NCTR of its capacity to engage \nin core mission-driven activities, such as publishing about the most promising practices for \ndeveloping skilled, experienced teachers into impactful mentors of new teacher residents. \n75.  Furthermore,  without  its  ability  to  continue  these  thirteen  teacher  residency \nprograms due to the loss of grant funding, Plaintiff NCTR is deprived of its ability to serve the K-\n12 school districts where there is high turnover and shortages of teachers and prepare educators \nfor careers to help mitigate these teacher shortages. \n76.  These harms prevent NCTR from engaging in the core activities compelled by its \nmission and reason for existence. \nB.  AACTE Member Organization - American University  \n77.  American University (“AU”) is a member organization of Plaintiff AACTE that \nhas been and will continue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the Department’s grant \nterminations. AU is in the second year of a five-year TQP grant. \n78.  AU’s  TQP  grant  funds  a  teacher  preparation  program  for  special  education \n(learning disabilities) and early childhood education, the Residency for Excellence in Teaching \nand Learning (“RETL”). \n22 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 22\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 23 of 39\n \n \n79.  RETL is a partnership between AU’s School of Education and its charter network, \nWashington D.C. Friendship Public Charter Schools, consisting of five charter campuses. The \npurpose of the partnership is to provide a pathway for educator development to address critical \nareas of need, including early childhood education and special education,11 and recruit highly \nmotivated preservice teacher candidates who are committed to teaching in diverse early childhood \nand special education settings (pre-K through grade five).  \n80.  The partnership enables participants to complete a residency-based master’s degree \nwith an initial teaching license in Early Childhood Education or Special Education - Learning \nDisabilities. In addition to earning their Masters of Arts in Teaching degree, program participants \nreceive comprehensive coaching, professional development, and ongoing support during the \nentirety of the three-year program -the residency year (the first year) and the induction years (the \nsecond and third year). \n81.  RETL supports pathways in high-need teaching areas of early childhood education \nand special education, specifically targeting urban and underserved geographic areas with their \npartner charter network. RETL services five Friendship Public Charter campuses.  \n82.  RETL provides a living stipend to participants and reduced tuition (by roughly 35% \nof the AU graduate tuition rate) to one of two AU’s School of Education’s Master of Arts in \nTeaching degrees, Special Education in Learning Disabilities and Early Childhood Education.  \n83.  AU was in its second year of RETL when the Department terminated the grant, \nwith eight students who are expected to graduate from AU in December 2025. With the funding \nfrom the TQP grant, AU planned to recruit an additional forty participants. As a result of the loss \n \n11 Washington D.C. is in need of educators for special education to serve students with disabilities. See \nhttps://specialedcoop.org/news-articles/the-state-of-special-education-in-the-district-of-columbia/, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/27/dc-students-disabilities-urgent-reform/. \n23 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 23\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 24 of 39\n \n \nof funding from the terminated TQP grant, AU will no longer be able to recruit future cohorts. As \na result, forty-eight future RETL participants who would have had the opportunity to earn a Master \nof Arts in Teaching degree and deepen their expertise and longevity as teachers in Washington \nD.C. will no longer have that opportunity.  \n84.  The termination of the TQP grant will halt AU’s efforts to remedy dramatic teacher \nshortages and improve outcomes for early childhood and special education students in Washington \nD.C. Up to 1,500 Washington D.C. students will be impacted by the termination of the grant, in \naddition to the educators at the charter school partners. \n85.  In addition, AU planned to expand to at least two additional charter schools in the \nremaining years of the TQP grant. As a result of the Department’s termination of AU’s grant, there \nis no opportunity for additional students and educators to be served. \n86.  The  termination  of  the  TQP  grant  will  also  result  in  AU  terminating  the \nemployment of its full-time coach/program director. \n87.  If funding through the TQP grant is not reinstated, the RETL program will be forced \nto close. \n88.  These harms prevent AU/RETL from engaging in the core activities compelled by \ntheir missions and reason for existence.  \nC.  AACTE Member Organization – University of St. Thomas  \n89.  The University of St. Thomas (“UST”) is a member organization of Plaintiff \nAACTE that has been and will continue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the \nDepartment’s grant terminations. UST is in the second year of a three-year SEED grant and the \nfifth year of a five-year TQP grant.  \n24 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 24\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 25 of 39\n \n \n90.  The UST SEED grant funds three pathway models to a career in education: (1) a \nresidency program for graduate students in partnership with St. Paul Public Schools, Minneapolis \nPublic Schools, and a consortium of charter schools; (2) a “work and learn” program for graduate \nstudents in partnership with schools throughout the state of Minnesota where paraprofessionals \nand teachers are employed while completing their teacher preparation program; and (3) an \nundergraduate program which prepares undergraduate students for educational careers in their \njunior and senior years at UST.  \n91.  The SEED grant provides funds of up to $20,000 per year for graduate students and \nup to $40,000 per year to undergraduate students who are pursuing teacher licensure in special \neducation and elementary education.  \n92.  UST is currently in year two of the three year SEED grant. In year two, the grant \nwas set to fund over 300 scholarships to future educators over the three year grant period, most of \nwhom  were  preparing  to  be  special  education  teachers,  for  approximately  $2,000,000. \nScholarships for fall and spring semester were disbursed to students prior to the grant termination. \nHowever, without access to the SEED grant funds, UST can no longer provide summer funding to \nthe majority of these future educators. As a result, many of the future educators may not be able \nto afford the schooling required to continue their path to becoming teachers.  \n93.  Year three of the SEED grant was set to fund scholarships in the amount of \n$2,200,000; termination of the grants will result in a loss of all of these scholarships. In addition, \ntermination of the SEED grants will result in a loss of funding for mentor teachers for professional \ndevelopment.  \n94.  To date, nearly 80 communities across the state of Minnesota have been taught by \nteachers who received SEED scholarship funds, including schools in rural, urban, suburban, and \n25 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 25\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 26 of 39\nexurban communities. Without continued SEED funding, the teacher pipeline program at UST will \ngraduate fewer students capable of serving in high-needs areas such as special education, which \nwill have widespread negative impacts on the many communities, teachers and students these \nteacher pipeline programs benefit. \n95. UST’s TQP grant removes financial barriers to careers in education by providing\nfunding for UST to partner with charter schools to provide living wage stipends to student teaching \nresidents preparing to become licensed educators. UST is in year five of this TQP grant, and at \npresent, 21 student teaching residents are in the middle of their second semester of student \nteaching. Collectively, the student teaching residents were set to receive $819,000 for stipends (the \nfirst half of which has already been paid), however, the termination of the TQP grant will put the \nliving-expense stipends for these students at risk.  \n96. These harms interfere with UST’s ability to serve its students, and through them, to\nserve the community and fulfill its mission to advance the common good.  \nD. NCTR and AACTE Member Organization – Alder Graduate School of\nEducation\n97. Alder Graduate School of Education (“Alder GSE”) is a member organization of\nPlaintiff NCTR and Plaintiff AACTE that has been and will continue to be substantially and \nirreparably harmed by the Department’s grant terminations. Alder GSE was awarded a five-year \nTQP grant in 2020, as well as a five-year TQP grant in 2022.  \n98. Both of Alder GSE’s TQP grants fund teacher residency programs.\n99. The teacher residency programs consist of partnerships between Alder GSE and\npartner K-12 school systems, including public school districts and a Special Education Planning \nArea, to operate community-based workforce development pathways for aspiring teachers.  \n26 \nAPPENDIX Page 26\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 27 of 39\n100. Alder GSE and its partner K-12 school systems recruit and prepare community\nmembers through a one-year teacher residency program, where candidates co-teach with a highly \nqualified mentor teacher while earning their Master’s degree and teaching credential. They are \noften hired immediately upon completion of the program, most often by the school systems where \nthey trained. \n101. The 2020 TQP grant’s goals are: (i) launch and scale a new and sustainable\nresidency program with three partner local education agency that meets local human capital needs; \n(ii) train, support and retain effective new teachers in schools with high concentrations of high\nneed students; and (iii) demonstrate the capacity of partners to scale, sustain, and replicate teacher \nresidency and development model. The 2022 TQP grant’s goals are: (i) build a pipeline of high-\nquality and diverse teachers in partnership with high-need local education agencies that effectively \nmeets their human capital needs and certification shortage areas; (ii) promote equity, strengthen \nstudent learning, and meet the social, emotional, and academic needs of students by modeling for \nand by building the capacity of mentors and residents to use evidence based practices and to create \npositive and inclusive learning environments; and (iii) increase impact by building capacity, \nsustainability and scale of the partnership and high-leverage strategies. \n102. The termination of the grants has had and will continue to have immense impacts\non the aspiring teacher candidates, mentor teachers, the partner K-12 school systems, and Alder \nGSE. \n103. For the 2024-2025 academic year, the teacher residency programs have 83 aspiring\nteacher candidates who were receiving a living stipend supplemented by the funds from the TQP \ngrants. The teaching candidates depend on these stipends to live, eat, and support their families – \nfor  most  they  are  their  only  source  of  income.  The  teaching  candidates  signed  Letters  of \n27 \nAPPENDIX Page 27\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 28 of 39\nCommitment before June 2024, with the expectation of a level of stipend for the entirety of the \nschool year. The teacher residency programs also presently have 83 mentor teachers who receive \na stipend funded by grant funds for their work in support of their efforts to train and develop new \nteachers. With the termination of the grants, the 83 aspiring teacher candidates and 83 mentor \nteachers will no longer receive the level of stipends they were promised. \n104. Alder GSE has already recruited 40 new teacher candidates for the 2025-2026\nacademic year and K-12 school systems had planned to provide the living stipends – the majority \nof which were planned to be supplemented with TQP grant funds. Alder GSE recruited the majority \nof these residents with the expectation of a level of funding for their living stipend that was \nsupplemented by the grant funding. The majority of these residents are enrolled, have signed letters \nof commitment, or are in final rounds of interviews/admissions. The financial impact of the grants’ \ntermination  will  affect  many  of  their  decisions  to  become  teachers.  Similarly,  the  grants’ \ntermination affects the stipend funding levels for mentors, which will have an impact on their \ndecision to continue with the role. \n105. Alder GSE similarly planned to recruit 40 new teacher candidates and 40 new\nmentors for the 2026-2027 academic year, however, with the loss in grant funds, it will be more \ndifficult for Alder GSE to recruit and prepare these future prospective candidates. \n106. The termination of the 2020 and 2022 TQP grants has caused and will continue to\ncause harm to the partner K-12 school systems as well. They are at risk of losing the teacher \ncandidates who taught in their schools, which will have a negative impact on the school and its \ncommunity. Alder GSE expects about $2.1 million of lost funding for their partner K-12 school \nsystems. \n28 \nAPPENDIX Page 28\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 29 of 39\n107. There were also a number of programmatic roles at Alder GSE that were partially\nsupported by these TQP grants. These roles were supporting operation of these partnerships and \nthese  residency  programs  -  including  recruitment,  admissions,  enrollment,  student  services, \nfinancial support, data and impact, academic programs, and clinical programs. Alder GSE expects \nabout $2.2 million of lost funding supporting Alder GSE costs to support these partnerships and \nresidency programs. \n108. Additionally,  the  terminations  will  cause  Alder  GSE  to  lose  approximately\n$600,000 in funding for evaluation contracts. Alder GSE’s evaluation partner was providing an \nimportant source of formative feedback and evidence of program effectiveness. The evaluation \nfrom TQP 2020 has a retention study in progress that is six months to completion, but will likely \nnot be completed as a result of the termination of the grant. The evaluation for TQP 2022 still had \n2.5 more years of data collection that has been terminated mid-cycle. \n109. In addition to the dollars lost, the time and resource demands to meet this sudden\nnews has been extraordinary. There have been countless hours of work to communicate clearly to \nall affected parties and to work with Alder GSE’s Board and team on determining ways to mitigate \nthese significant and completely unexpected losses.  \n110. These harms prevent Alder GSE from engaging in the core activities compelled by\nits mission and reason for existence.  \nE. AACTE Member Organization – Teaching Lab\n111. Teaching Lab is a member organization of Plaintiff AACTE that has been and will\ncontinue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the Department’s grant terminations. In \n2023, Teaching Lab was awarded a three-year TSL grant. \n29 \nAPPENDIX Page 29\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 30 of 39\n112. Teaching Lab’s TSL grant funds Project Refine, Innovate, Share, and Elevate\n(“Project RISE”). Project RISE involves the following: (i) implementation of Teaching Lab’s \nteacher leadership and coaching model for public K-12 school systems located in Milwaukee, \nWisconsin, Kemper, Mississippi, El Paso, Texas, and Osceola, Arkansas (the “Public School \nBeneficiaries”); (ii) development of human capital management systems in the foregoing districts; \nand (iii) a rigorous, randomized controlled trial on Teaching Lab’s teacher development and \ncoaching model, to be conducted in partnership with the American Institutes for Research, focused \non the work in Milwaukee.  \n113. Across all of the Public School Beneficiaries, Teaching Lab’s programs through\nthe TSL grant impact more than 40 schools and more than 150 teachers, whose instruction in turn \nreaches well over 6,000 K-12 students.  \n114. Teaching Lab’s TSL grant was terminated by the Department, resulting in great\nuncertainty regarding the future of Project Rise. Absent the grant funding, Teaching Lab will no \nlonger be able to provide the curriculum-based professional learning and coaching services \nthrough Project RISE to the Public School Beneficiaries. At this time, Teaching Lab does not have \nan alternate source of funding. The Public School Beneficiaries do not have room in their budget \nto unexpectedly pay for the services. \n115. Teaching Lab has hired more than two dozen employees and contractors to support\nProject RISE. If the TSL grant funding is suspended for any amount of time, Teaching Lab will \nlikely have to furlough or layoff many or all of these workers.  \n116. The termination of the grant also puts the American Institutes for Research study\nevaluating how school districts can best spend their limited funds and limited teacher development \ntime and resources at risk. Teaching Lab is not able to fund the study without the TSL grant funds. \n30 \nAPPENDIX Page 30\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 31 of 39\n117. In addition to the loss of the study, the Public School Beneficiaries and the public\nwill be significantly harmed by the termination of the grant, as one or more of the Public School \nBeneficiaries is likely to lose the benefit of Teaching Lab’s services. Specifically, the Public \nSchool Beneficiaries stand to lose value of up to roughly $7 million in services if the termination \nmoves forward. \n118. These harms prevent Project RISE from engaging in the core activities compelled\nby its mission and reason for existence.  \nF. AACTE Member Organization – University A12\n119. University A is a member organization of Plaintiff AACTE that has been and will\ncontinue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the Department’s grant terminations. In \n2022, University A was awarded a five-year TQP grant. \n120. University A’s TQP grant funds Program A, a program that supports talented rural\nindividuals to receive an undergraduate degree and license without leaving their hometown. \nCandidates can receive a Bachelor of Arts degree and a teaching license in early childhood \neducation, elementary education, special education, middle school math education, and secondary \nscience education. University A partners with rural community colleges employing many rural \neducators.  \n121. Program A was created to address the extreme teacher shortage in rural State A.\nPre-K through year 12 students can go years without a qualified teacher, forcing rural districts to \nhire people without degrees or experience and negatively impacting rural students’ learning. \n12 University A is an AACTE member organization that is fearful of retaliation, and therefore, did not wish \nto disclose its name in this Complaint or provide a Declaration that identified it by name. However, it \nwanted to share the severe and devastating impact the Department’s termination of its TQP grant has caused \nand will continue to cause, absent Court intervention. This Complaint refers to the member organization as \n“University A” in State A, and its teacher preparation program as “Program A.” \n31 \nAPPENDIX Page 31\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 32 of 39\n122. Program A’s TQP grant has an immensely positive economic impact on rural\ncommunities in State A. Specifically, the program funded by the grant serves 57 rural State A \nschool districts in partnership with four rural community colleges. These districts stretch across \nState A representing some of the most financially impoverished communities in State A, and have \nsome of the highest teacher shortage areas in the state. Program A was able to provide teachers for \nmore than 2,500 students in pre-K through year 12 each year. \n123. Program A graduated 49 teachers who are presently teaching in State A rural\nschools. Currently, there are 77 students supported through the grant, as well as eight recent \ngraduates supported within required induction supports.  \n124. The termination of the grant forced University A to terminate the employment of\nthe instructors who teach the courses, and eliminated the infrastructure and human resources that \nsupport Program A. University A anticipated preparing 146 teachers by the end of the five-year \ngrant in 2027 and anticipated supporting these new teachers in their beginning years of teaching. \nThe termination of the grant will result in a loss of 69 new teachers for these hard-hit rural areas. \n125. Furthermore, there was a total of 11 full-time equivalent positions in both rural\ncommunities and in State A’s major city funded through the grant, however with the grant’s \ntermination, the money supporting rural grant employee salaries was lost immediately; State A’s \ncommunity college partners are uncertain about the ability to utilize emergency institutional funds \nto continue them, even short term. University A is using emergency funding to support State A \ngrant employees until the end of the Spring 2025 semester, however, after the end of the semester, \nall of the rural grant employees will be forced to be let go. \n32 \nAPPENDIX Page 32\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 33 of 39\n \n \n126.  With the grant’s termination, Program A will no longer be able to continue, which \nwill have significant consequences on University A and its community as well as the rural \ncommunities it serves. \n127.  These harms prevent Program A from engaging in the core activities compelled by \nits mission and reason for existence.  \nX.  Defendants’  Actions  Will  Cause  Plaintiffs  and  Their  Member  Organizations \nImmediate and Irreparable Harm.  \n128.  Defendants’ actions have harmed Plaintiffs and their member organizations by \nunlawfully depriving them of funding, which without Court intervention, will continue to cause \nimmediate and irreparable harm. \n129.  The funding was also used towards tuition support for enrollment at many of the \ncolleges and universities. Without this ability of the Grant Recipients to address significant \nfinancial barriers for students, many will no longer be able to afford to continue to pursue a career \nin teaching and the programs’ attendance will plummet.  \n130.  Due to the lack of funding for these programs, the Grant Recipients presently have, \nand will continue to have, a more difficult time recruiting new students. The tuition and other \nfinancial supports provided by the grants was used as a recruitment tool by the Grant Recipients. \nWithout these tools to make it more affordable for cohorts of future teachers to pursue education \ncareers, enrollment will decline, and significant structural changes will have to be made to address \nthat  decline,  including  changes  that  it  may  take  years  to  repair,  such  as  loss  of  staff  and \ninfrastructure that cannot be easily re-scaled. \n131.  The termination of grants will jeopardize the pipeline of high-quality educators \nentering into schools nationwide. The forced closure of the teacher preparation programs as a result \n33 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 33\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 34 of 39\nof the lack of funding results in losing talented candidates who are ready and eager to serve \nstudents, particularly in high-need areas like special education.  \n132. The loss of funding will not only significantly reduce the Grant Recipients’ ability\nto address the ongoing teacher shortage, but also exacerbate the teacher shortages, especially in \nrural and urban communities, across the country.  \n133. Without the grant funding, the Grant Recipients will no longer be able to provide\ntargeted resources and training, peer support networks, professional development, and mentorship \nthat are critical to teachers’ success in the classroom. \n134. The termination of the grants is also resulting in, and will continue to result in, loss\nof employment for the dedicated staff members and grant managers who worked to make the \nteacher preparation programs run. \n135. The harm suffered by Plaintiffs is actual, not theoretical, as the funding was\nterminated in February 2025, immediately resulting in the Grant Recipients’ inability to continue \ntheir programs, particularly given that the terminations occurred in the middle of the academic \nyear. \n136. The loss of the funding will frustrate the Grant Recipients’ abilities to fulfil their\nmission of providing programs to offer supports to improve the quality of teaching and school \nleadership. \n137. The Termination Letters provide that the Grant Recipients may challenge the\ntermination decision by submitting information documenting their position in writing to the \nDepartment within thirty days of the termination. See Exhibit B at pages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. \n34 \nAPPENDIX Page 34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 35 of 39\n \n \n138.  However, any appeal to the Department does not alter the fact that the termination \nof funding was effective on the date of notification in February 2025. There is no funding provided \nstarting the date of termination pending any appeals. \n139.  There is no timeframe by which the Department is obliged to make a determination \nregarding an appeal. Therefore, even if the Grant Recipients appeal the termination decision, the \ntimeframe in which a determination would be made is unknown. While any appeals are pending, \nthe Grant Recipients will continue to be deprived of funding.  \n140.  Absent Court intervention, regardless of whether the Grant Recipients submit an \nappeal to the Department, many Grant Recipients will be forced to shut down their programs as a \nresult of Defendants’ unlawful actions, resulting in great harm. \nXI.  Plaintiffs  were  Further  Harmed  by  Defendants’  Unlawfully  Imposed  Grant \nConditions. \n141.  Generally, unless a grantee poses a specific risk, they can draw down funds from \ntheir grant award based on the allowable, allocable and reasonable costs approved in their grant \nbudget without prior approval. \n142.  In addition to the unlawful actions concerning terminating the grants discussed \nabove, the Department also added a special condition to impacted grants after they were terminated \nrequiring prior approval for them to draw down funds. This special condition is referred to as \n“route pay.” \n143.  The  grantees  are  eligible  for  costs  that  were  properly  incurred  before  their \ntermination date and costs that would not have occurred if the grant was not terminated. They have \n120 days to draw down the funds after the termination date. (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.343, 200.472, \n200.344(b)).  \n35 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 35\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 36 of 39\n \n \n144.  The regulations that govern federal grants set the reasons that the Department can \nput conditions on grants and the requirements for notice prior to doing so. Imposing a special \ncondition, such as establishing additional prior approvals, on a grant can only be done if the grantee \nis determined to pose a risk. Factors that may be considered are financial stability, quality of \nmanagement systems and standards, history of performance, audit reports and filings, ability to \neffectively implement requirements, history of compliance with conditions of a federal award, or \na responsibility determination. (2 C.F.R. § 200.208). \n145.  The rule also states that before conditions are put in place, the agency has to notify \nthe grantee as to: (1) The nature of the additional requirements; (2) The reason why the additional \nrequirements are being imposed; (3) The nature of the action needed to remove the additional \nrequirement, if applicable; (4) The time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and \n(5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. (Id.). \n146.  Without notice or any finding of individual grantee risk, the Department put a \nblanket condition on the terminated grants to require prior approval for all drawdowns. \n147.  This new, unlawfully-imposed condition will cause delays in the Grant Recipients \nreceiving their grant funds and add potential subjectivity to already approved costs. \n148.  Therefore, placing the grants on route pay was unlawful.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  \n(Fifth Amendment Due Process (Vagueness)) \n149.  All preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are incorporated as if fully set forth \nherein. \n150.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a governmental \nenactment, like an executive order, is unconstitutionally vague if it “fails to provide a person of \n36 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 36\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 37 of 39\n \n \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 \n(2008). \n151.  The Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 “fails to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited” and “is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” Id. \n152.  Executive Order 14151 does not define key terms, including “DEI,” “DEIA,” \n“equity” or “equity-related” and fails to satisfy the constitutional minimum. \n153.  This Court previously granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the President’s \nadministration from terminating any awards on the basis of the Termination Provision in the \nNADOHE Order.  \n154.  The NADOHE Order applies to not just the named plaintiffs in that action, but to \nall contractors and grantees who were subjected to the Termination Provision. \n155.  Plaintiffs  and  their  member  organizations  were  subjected  to  the  Termination \nProvision when the Department terminated the grants at issue in this lawsuit under the instructions \nprovided in Executive Order 14151. \n156.  It follows, therefore, that Plaintiffs should also be returned to the status quo ante – \ntheir status prior to the Department subjecting them to the unlawful Termination Provision when \nit terminated their grants – just as the NADOHE Order intended. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  \n(Violation of APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Decision) \n157.  All preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are incorporated as if fully set forth \nherein. \n37 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 37\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 38 of 39\n \n \n158.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law . . . [or \nare made] without observance of procedure required by law[.]” (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). \n159.  Defendants’ termination of the Grant Recipients’ grants constitutes final agency \naction under the APA. The Termination Letters provide that the “Department hereby terminates \ngrant No. [] in its entirety effective 2/[]/25,” marking it the consummation of the Department’s \ndecision-making process and demanding immediate compliance with the announced position. As \nof the date of the Termination Letters, the Department stopped providing all funding approved by \nthe  grants,  thereby  having  a  direct  and  immediate  effect  on  Plaintiffs  and  their  member \norganizations. \n160.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the grants is unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious \nfor the reasons set forth above. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:  \n(A)  Declare Defendants’ termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants unlawful; \n(B)  Declare Defendants’ actions placing TQP, SEED, and TSL grants on route pay \nunlawful; \n(C)  Enter  a  preliminary  injunction  or  temporary  restraining  order  (a) enjoining \nDefendants’ enforcement of the termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants; (b) ordering such \ngrant funding reinstated forthwith; (c) ordering Defendants to provide the Grant Recipients \nreimbursement for all otherwise allowable expenditures incurred between the date of termination \nand the Court’s order; (d) enjoining Defendants’ termination of any additional TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants if such termination would be inconsistent with the Court’s order; and (e) removing the \nroute pay grant conditions from TQP, SEED, and TSL grants;  \n38 \n \nAPPENDIX Page 38\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 39 of 39\n \n \n(D)  Issue a permanent injunction providing the same relief;  \n(E)  Award Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and  \n(F)  Grant such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \nDated: March 3, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Daniel M.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims \nand that an injunction is both in the public interest and in the interest of the equities at play here. \nThe Government does not dispute that in the absence of an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer \nirreparable harm. ECF No. 24 (“Def. Br.”) at 13. The Government also does not dispute that the \ntermination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants constituted final agency action, or that the \nterminations, if undertaken today, would violate the NADOHE order. See generally Def. Br.  \nAs a result, the remaining live issues are: (1) whether Plaintiffs are properly before this \nCourt; (2) whether continued enforcement of terminations that would be unlawful if taken today \nis permissible because it preceded a court order; and (3) whether “agency Priorities” as used in \nSection 200.340(a)(4) provides for essentially limitless discretion in terminating grants, as the \nGovernment argues. As shown below, Plaintiffs have established both standing and venue in this \naction; the Department’s continued enforcement of the terminations violates the Fifth Amendment \nto the Constitution via the NADOHE order; and the Government’s interpretation of “agency \npriorities” is completely unsupported by the text and a common-sense read of the law at issue. The \nCourt  should  enter  a  preliminary  injunction  ordering  the  Department  to  vacate  the  grant \nterminations for Plaintiffs and their members on both Fifth Amendment and APA grounds.  \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Venue is Proper in The State of Maryland. \nPlaintiffs have invoked venue pursuant to § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1), ECF No. 1 at ¶ 11, and \nvenue is proper in this District under both provisions. Section 1391(e) establishes venue in this \ndistrict because Plaintiff MACTE resides in this District, a proposition the Government neither \nchallenges nor addresses in its brief. This is really the end of the inquiry, but since the Government \nchallenges venue under (b)(2) as well, Plaintiffs will address it as well. \n1 \nAPPENDIX Page 43\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 5 of 19\n \nWhere, as here, a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States acting in her \nofficial capacity (Defendant McMahon), or an agency of the United States (Defendant Department \nof Education), the action may be brought in a judicial district where “the plaintiff resides if no real \nproperty is involved in the action.” 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C). Federal courts applying this venue \nprovision have concluded that only a single plaintiff need reside in the district to establish venue. \nSee A.J. Taft Coal Co. v. Barnhart, 291 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1301 (N.D. Ala. 2003) (collecting cases \nand remarking that “[f]or over thirty years federal courts have conclusively and consistently held \nthat the statutory language in 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(3)[1] regarding the residency of ‘the plaintiff’ \nshould be interpreted to mean any plaintiff rather than all plaintiffs.”) (emphasis in original); see \nalso id. at 1302 (“This court concludes that under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(3), a suit can be brought in \nany district in which a single plaintiff resides.”); Sidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d \n336, 345-46 (6th Cir. 2005) (“[T]he case law and legislative history compel this Court to hold that \nthe residency requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(3) is satisfied if at least one plaintiff resides in \nthe district in which the action has been brought.”). This action names as defendants an executive \nbranch official sued in her official capacity and an agency of the United States. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 15-\n16. MACTE is a resident of Maryland with its principal place of business located at 304 Hawkins \nHall, Towson University, Towson, Maryland 21252. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 14. Venue is, therefore, plainly \nproper pursuant to § 1391(e)(1)(C). \nAnd as noted, although Plaintiffs need not satisfy two different bases for venue, they do. \nVenue is also proper in this District because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim \noccurred in Maryland. As a threshold matter, MACTE is a member organization—not a “Maryland \n \n1 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) was restyled in 2011 to remove the numeric list—e.g., (1), (2), (3)—and insert the \nletters (A), (B), and (C). \n2 \nAPPENDIX Page 44\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 6 of 19\n \nchapter” of a national organization. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 14 (describing MACTE as “membership \norganization”  that  includes  “regionally  accredited  colleges  and  universities  engaged  in  the \npreparation of professional school personnel with state program approval”); ECF No. 24 at 15. \nMore specifically, three of MACTE’s member organizations—Towson University, the \nUniversity of Maryland, and Frostburg State University—suffered termination of SEED and/or \nTQP grants. Supplemental Declaration of Laurie Mullen (“Supp. Mullen Decl.”) at ¶ 4. Towson \nUniversity’s TQP grant was terminated in February 2025 by the Department. The TQP grant was \napproved on September 4, 2024, for a period of one year (October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025), \nin the amount of $849,659. Future budget periods were outlined as follows: budget period 2 \n(10/1/2025-9/30/2026) - $811,249; budget period 3 (10/1/2026-9/30/2027) - $1,099,920; budget \nperiod  4  (10/1/2027-9/30/2028)  -  $1,240,123;  budget  period  5  (10/1/2028-9/30/2029)  - \n$1,152,933. Supp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 6. The University of Maryland’s SEED grant was terminated \nin February 2025 by the Department. The terminated SEED grant was approved to begin on \nOctober 1, 2022, for a period of three years, in the amount of $4,808,683. Supp. Mullen Decl. at \n¶ 7. Frostburg State University’s TQP grant was also terminated in February 2025. Supp. Mullen \nDecl. at ¶ 8.  \nThe  Government  represents  that  the  grant  terminations  described  in  the  Complaint \n“occurred in eight states but not in Maryland,” ECF No. 24 at 13, a perplexing assertion not just \nbecause the Plaintiffs attached a declaration to their motion making clear that Maryland programs \nwere impacted by the grant termination (ECF No. 5-5 (stating the grant terminations “result[ed] in \na substantial loss of funds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland”)), but because the \nGovernment cites, and is thus presumably familiar with, litigation proceeding as California v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, in the District of Massachusetts. ECF No. 24 at 11-12, 17 \n3 \nAPPENDIX Page 45\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 7 of 19\n \n(recognizing that “Maryland grants were terminated”), in which multiple declarations and the \nCourt’s  opinion  entering  a  TRO  confirmed  that  Maryland-based  grants  were  terminated. \nSpecifically,  the  Department  terminated  MACTE  member  Towson  University’s  TQP  grant \nfunding, which effectively terminated Towson’s Preparing and Retaining Inclusive Maryland \nEducators (“PRIME”) project. A true and accurate copy of the Towson declaration filed in that \ncase is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Joshua W.B. Richards (“Richards Decl.”). \nAnother declaration in that case detailed resultant harm of SEED grant termination in Maryland \nfor another MACTE member, the University of Maryland. California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 1:25-\ncv-10548-MJJ, ECF No. 8-15. A true and accurate copy of that declaration is attached as Exhibit \nB to the Richards Declaration. Not only that, but it is a matter of public record, of which this Court \nmay take judicial notice, that Maryland grants were awarded, including those to Towson, Frostburg \nState,  and  the  University  of  Maryland:  https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/teacher-\nprep/teacher-quality-partnership-program#awards,  https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-\nprograms/teacher-prep/supporting-effective-educator-development-grant-program#awards;  It  is \nalso not in matter of reasonable dispute that the Government has terminated all teaching grants. \nSee Richards Decl. Ex. C. Accordingly, a substantial portion of events took place in Maryland and \nvenue in this District is proper pursuant to § 1391(b)(2) as well. \nB.  MACTE has Established Standing. \nTo demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must show “(i) that she has suffered or likely will \nsuffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will be caused by the defendant, \nand (iii) that the injury likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.” FDA v. All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024); Deal v. Mercer Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, \n187 (4th Cir. 2018). “To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, \n4 \nAPPENDIX Page 46\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 8 of 19\n \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (cleaned up). \nAn organization can establish standing in one of two ways: either “in its own right to seek \njudicial relief for injury to itself,” or “as a representative of its members who have been harmed.” \nPeople for Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v. Tri-State Zoological Park of W. Md., Inc., 843 F. \nApp’x 493, 495 (4th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). An organization must only “make specific \nallegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.” S. \nWalk at Broadlands Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, \n184 (4th Cir. 2013) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 \n(2009)); see also Nat’l Assoc. of Diversity Officers in Higher Ed., et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., \nNo.  1:25-CV-00333-ABA,  2025  WL  573764,  at  *9  (D.  Md.  Feb.  21,  2025)  (“When  an \norganization is alleging harm, it may establish standing based on its own injury or based on its \nmembers’ injuries, the latter of which is called representational or associational standing.”) (citing \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 199 \n(2023)).  \nMoreover, “[a]n organization may have standing to sue on its own behalf for injuries it \nsustains as a result of a defendant’s actions.” Republican Nat’l Comm. v. North Carolina State \nBoard of Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 395 (4th Cir. 2024) (citing Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, \n455 U.S. 363, 379 n.19 (1982)). “[T]he organization must make the necessary showing to \ndemonstrate Article III standing—an injury-in-fact, caused by the defendant, that can be redressed \nby a favorable decision from the court.” Id. (quoting Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 393–94); \nsee also Lane v. Holder, 703 F.3d 668, 674 (4th Cir. 2012) (recognizing that an organization must \nshow it has suffered an “injury in fact,” in that defendant’s “actions impede its efforts to carry out \nits mission.” (citation omitted); Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379 (observing that an organization \n5 \nAPPENDIX Page 47\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 19\n \nhas standing to sue in its own right if the organization has suffered a “concrete and demonstrable \ninjury to the organization’s activities—with [a] consequent drain on the organization’s resources—\nconstitut[ing] . . . more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests”). \nMACTE has done more than show an “intense interest” or “strong opposition” to the \nchallenged conduct. ECF No. 24 at 16. It has demonstrated that numerous of its members suffered \nactual harm. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 14. If there were any doubt, the Supplemental Mullen Declaration, \nattached hereto, makes the point abundantly clear. Defendants terminated grant funding for three \nMaryland educational institutions, each of which are MACTE members: Towson University, \nSupp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 6; the University of Maryland, Supp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 7; and Frostburg \nState University, Supp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 8. Because MACTE’s member organizations suffered an \ninjury in fact—i.e., termination of grant funding—MACTE has standing to pursue this action. See \nS. Walk, 713 F.3d at 184. \nTo be sure, the termination of its member organizations’ SEED and/or TQP grants also \nsignificantly  impairs  MACTE’s  core  mission.  ECF  No.  1  at  14.  This  is  a  “concrete  and \ndemonstrable injury” to MACTE that drains its resources. Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs alleged that all of the grant recipients are similarly situated. ECF No. 1 \nat  ¶  6  (“All  of  the  Grant  Recipients  are  similarly  situated  because  the  substance  of  each \nTermination Letter and added terms and conditions in the Grant Award Notifications from the \nDepartment are identical, indicating the same reasons with the same terminology for the grant \nterminations.”). MACTE has, therefore, established organization standing. \n6 \nAPPENDIX Page 48\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 10 of 19\n \nC.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Succeed On The Merits. \n1.  This Court’s NADOHE Order Applies to Plaintiffs in this Action and \nthe Department should be Enjoined from Enforcing the Termination \nof the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \nThe heart of the Government’s argument with respect to the NADOHE order2 is that, yes, \nthe Department terminated the grants at issue here because of DEI, which flowed from the J20 \norder, see ECF No. 24 at 8 (citing Department directives, including one that “Diversity, Equity, \nand Inclusion initiatives unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, or other protected characteristic”) (cleaned up), but, the Government argues, because the \nDepartment terminated the grants before the NADOHE order was issued, neither the order nor the \nreasoning supporting it apply. The Government is wrong.  \nFirst, and as set forth in Plaintiff’s brief, the Government’s argument turns the principles \nunderlying the NADOHE order on their head. The J20 order was unconstitutionally vague because \nit did not sufficiently define what kind of conduct was unlawful, and therefore deprived courts of \nthe ability to test its lawfulness and deprived grant recipients (and others) of the opportunity to \nseek to conform their conduct to the law before being deprived of rights. See Nat’l Assoc. of \nDiversity Officers in Higher Ed., et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 \nWL 573764, at *19-20 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025).  \nThe fact that Plaintiffs here had no opportunity to even attempt to conform their conduct \nbecause the Government acted pursuant to an unlawful order before Plaintiffs sought relief does \n \n2 The Court issued a Clarified Preliminary Injunction on March 10, 2025 in National Association of \nDiversity Officers in Higher Education, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA. The \nClarified Preliminary Injunction redefines “Enjoined Parties” to include: “Defendants other than the \nPresident, as well as all other federal executive branch agencies, departments, and commissions, and their \nheads, officers, agents, and subdivisions directed pursuant to the J20 and J21 Orders[.]” It does not modify \nthe Court’s prior Order issued on February 21, 2025 in any substantive way relevant to this action. \n \n7 \nAPPENDIX Page 49\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 11 of 19\n \nnot make the J20 order less unconstitutionally vague or, critically, the continued enforcement of \ndeprivations that flowed from the order less unlawful. See Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 274 (4th Cir. 2019) (observing that the purpose of the fair notice \nrequirement  is  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  individuals  to  “conform  their  conduct  to  the \nproscriptions of the law”) (citation omitted); see also id. at 278 (condemning unconstitutionally \nvague statutory language that invited arbitrary enforcement). To conclude otherwise would create \nincredible perverse incentives for government officials to shoot first and answer questions later, \nwhich is in fact what seems to have happened here. Plaintiffs’ deprivation was compounded by the \nlack of any real opportunity for a post-deprivation challenge to the termination decisions because \nthe form termination letters failed to provide any specificity about the reason that the Department \nfound any individual grant allegedly “inconsistent with. . . Department priorities.” The form \ntermination letters instead merely list, disjunctively, five vague ways in which the specific grant \nat issue might be “inconsistent” with purported agency priorities.  \nSecond, the Government argues at page 20 of its brief that the “documentary record \nindicates  agency  review;”  this  is  presumably  meant  to  be  contrasted  with  generalized  and \nunreasoned terminations based on the vague and undefined concepts in the J20 Order. The \nGovernment provides no citation to support its assertion of “agency review,” which is, in fact, \nbelied by the record before the Court. The termination letters and Grant Award Notifications \n(“GANs”) filed with the Court, which Plaintiffs have alleged are essentially identical across all \ntheir members’ terminations, see ECF 1 at ¶¶ 5-6, demonstrate that no independent agency review \nof individual grants, underscoring the fears that accompany a vague order like J20.  \nNo exemplar grant termination presented by the Government lists any actual reason that \nany individual grant violates any term or condition of the award, to say nothing of how it might \n8 \nAPPENDIX Page 50\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 12 of 19\n \nviolate the J20 Order (even if that order were not unlawful). None of the termination letters \npresented by Plaintiffs do either. See ECF No. 1-1 at 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40; ECF No. 1-2 at 1, \n3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13; see also Richards Decl. Ex. A at 68, 72, Ex. B at 68. To the contrary, the \nDepartment undertook no individualized inquiry into specific grants, instead sending a form letter \nand a form basis in each GAN terminating the grants, and then issued a press release.  \nThe Government mounts no serious challenge to the proposition that its terminations of \nPlaintiffs’ members grants would be unlawful under the NADOHE order if undertaken today. Its \nargument that continued enforcement of those terminations is somehow insulated from scrutiny \nunder the same standard lacks any justification and should be rejected by the Court. \n2.  The Department’s Termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants \nViolates the Administrative Procedures Act. \nThe Government does not dispute that the grant terminations at issue here constitute final \nagency action under the APA.  \nIn attempting to justify the terminations, the Government begins by conceding that Federal \nregulations allow agencies to terminate grants for “no other reason” apart from when “an award \nno longer effectuates . . . agency priorities.” ECF No. 24 at 25 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340).3 As an \ninitial matter, the Government points to no explanation as to how the individual terminated awards, \nor even the awards writ large, failed to effectuate those priorities, or what the priorities are, or by \nwhat process the priorities were “issued,” beyond arguing that there are “big picture” priorities \nthat every administration may have and that the grants here were terminated for that reason. The \nclosest the Government comes to articulating a reason is a hedged denial that it was because of \n \n3 While it is true that the failure to effectuate agency priorities is the only ground for termination at issue \nhere, there are actually four reasons a federal award could be terminated, all enumerated in Section \n200.340(a). \n9 \nAPPENDIX Page 51\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 13 of 19\n \nDEI. See Def. Br. at  20 (“Although Plaintiffs assume DOE terminated their grants because of the \nJ20 Executive Order that NADOHE enjoined, DOE does not concede this and the documentary \nrecord indicates independent agency review.”) The Government’s arguments here are neither \ndeveloped nor persuasive. \nFirst, the Government argues that the provision in the Uniform Guidance, 2 CFR Part 200 \n– the federal government rules for grants – stating that the Federal agency can terminate an award \nif it no longer “effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, confusingly \ndoes not actually refer to agency grant Priorities at all. The Government acknowledges that if that \nwere the case, the Priorities would need to be set through notice and comment rulemaking. See \nECF No. 24 at 24. The Government’s reading, divorcing the term “agency priorities” from the \ncontext of grants in which it appears, requires a willful disregard for the provisions that surround \nthe use of the term. Section 200.340 is about termination of grants and 2 C.F.R. Part 200, in which \nit appears, is devoted entirely to the administration of federal awards. Section 200.340(a)(1) states \nthat the terms and conditions of the grant must be followed, and 200.340(a)(4) refers to the goals \nof the grant program or agency priorities. A plain reading of 200.340(a)(4) makes it clear that \nthroughout the subclause, the regulation speaks to different aspects of grants – namely, grant \nprogram goals and grant Priorities, the very Priorities that were set when the grant was awarded \nand which can only be reset through rulemaking.  \nAs explained in Plaintiffs’ brief in support of their motion, the statute governing how the \nEducation Department specifically must set Priorities for grants is GEPA, 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d). \nThe Department of Education is unique in being obliged by a specific statute to use notice and \ncomment rulemaking for grants. GEPA instructs clearly that the ordinary and general APA \nexemption for rulemaking for grants does not apply to the Education Department (except in limited \n10 \nAPPENDIX Page 52\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 14 of 19\n \ncircumstances, not relevant here). 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d). This matters because the Government \nargues as a policy matter, and erroneously, that if the rule is interpreted to mean what it says, every \nfederal agency would be powerless to shift its activities with new Presidential administrations \nabsent a lengthy public rulemaking process. But in fact, only the Education Department is subject \nto GEPA, and Congress stated that decision unambiguously, so the Government’s argument in that \nregard holds no water.  \nThe parties agree that agency Priorities do and must reflect each Administration’s specific \nmissions and agenda. Even so, Congress specifically passed a law stating that for the Department \nof Education, agency Priorities for grants must go through rulemaking. This Department has not \ndone so, it cannot utilize new, un-set “Priorities” to determine what has or has not been effectuated. \nBut even if the Department’s attenuated position that the words “agency priorities” for \ngrants in the termination regulation did not refer to the same “priorities” explicitly required \nelsewhere in Department grant regulations, it would not change the fact that Defendants still did \nnot follow the proper procedure in terminating the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants in February 2025. \nThe Government’s deflection on agency priorities just opens the door to greater problems. \nThe  Department’s  articulated  reason  for  the  grant  terminations  in  the  GANs  and \ntermination letters, which Defendants repeat in their Opposition, is that the grants were terminated \nbecause they are “inconsistent with,4 and no longer effectuate[], Department priorities,” citing to \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). But Section 200.340(a)(4) actually provides that a federal award may be \nterminated “[b]y the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to the terms and conditions \nof the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates \nthe program goals or agency priorities.” (emphasis added). The word “including,” in this instance, \n \n4 The phrase “inconsistent with” does not appear in the termination regulation. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). \n11 \nAPPENDIX Page 53\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 15 of 19\n \nmust be read to bring everything that follows it within the scope of the phrase that immediately \nprecedes it, to wit: “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the grant award.” Section 200.340(b) \ngoes  on  to  provide  that  “[t]he  Federal  agency  or  pass-through  entity  must  clearly  and \nunambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.”  \nIn other words, all reasons that the Federal agency may terminate the grant must be “clearly \nand unambiguously” specified in the terms and conditions of that particular grant, and only if the \nterms and conditions specify that the Federal agency may terminate for “no longer effectuat[ing] \n[] agency priorities” in a clear and unambiguous way is the Federal agency permitted to do so. \nThis raises a number of obvious problems for the Government’s proposed alternative reading of \n(a)(4), because the terms and conditions of the Federal awards here contain just one line that states \nthat “2 CFR PART 200.” See Supplemental Declaration of Kathlene Campbell on behalf of NCTR \nEx. A at 4; Richards Decl. Ex. A at 15; Richards Decl. Ex. B at 14. \nThe Government points to nowhere in the Federal awards at issue where the terms and \nconditions specifically state that a grant may be terminated for no longer effectuating actual agency \npriorities, let alone a tortured reading of “agency priorities” so far divorced from the rest of the \nstatutory and regulatory scheme so as to provide for limitless flexibility. It goes without saying, \nthen, that the terms and conditions do not state in a “clear and unambiguous” manner that the \nDepartment may terminate awards on the basis of a change in what the Government somewhat \nmushily calls “big-picture Department priorities,” which require no notice, no reasoned basis, and \nappear to be the definition of the arbitrariness the APA was intended to avoid.  \nIt bears emphasis that agency priorities are not subject to whim. In pointing out the error \nof the Government’s argument on this point, and the implications of their argument, Plaintiffs are \n12 \nAPPENDIX Page 54\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 16 of 19\n \nnot inviting the Court to rule on matters beyond the scope of those necessary to resolve the claims \nat issue; this motion can and should be resolved by ruling that “agency priorities” do not change \nwithout rulemaking, and the Department has neither engaged in rulemaking nor explained how \nany of the terminated grants have ceased to effectuate priorities they met when they were awarded. \nBut in the event the Court finds it necessary to test the Government’s contrary argument, the \nGovernment fails in its task because nothing approaching the level of discretion to unilaterally \nterminate appeared alongside “2 CFR PART 200” in Plaintiffs’ notices of award, so regardless of \nwhat “agency priorities” in the termination provision refers to, the Department failed to follow its \nregulations. \nD.  Government’s Argument with Respect to the Scope of Relief. \nThe Government argues that if relief is granted, it should be limited in two ways. First, the \nGovernment argues that if granted, a preliminary injunction should be limited in scope to include \nonly the terminated grants of those member organizations which were specifically identified by \nname in Plaintiffs’ Complaint. However, the Government fails to acknowledge that Plaintiffs \nalleged that all of the grant recipients are similarly situated. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 6 (“All of the Grant \nRecipients are similarly situated because the substance of each Termination Letter and added terms \nand conditions in the Grant Award Notifications from the Department are identical, indicating the \nsame reasons with the same terminology for the grant terminations.”). Simply providing relief to \nthe member organizations which submitted Declarations in conjunction with the Complaint would \ndeprive all of the similarly situated member organizations the relief to which they are similarly \nentitled and subject them to harm that the Government has already conceded is irreparable. See \nalso Richards Decl. Ex. C (email from the Department on February 21, 2025 confirming that “[a]ll \nthe grants have been terminated[.]”). Accordingly, it would be inequitable for relief to be limited \nin the manner suggested by the Government. \n13 \nAPPENDIX Page 55\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 17 of 19\n \nSecond, while it is unclear if the Government is asking for the Court to remand the matter \nto the Department to provide an explanation for each grant termination in the absence of a \npreliminary injunction, or to limit an injunction to such relief, in any event, such a remand would \nlikewise perpetuate irreparable harm and is accordingly inequitable and not in the public interest \nas a remedy.  \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Request for Removing the Route Pay Condition is Clear. \nWhile the Government attempts to sidestep responding to Plaintiffs’ allegations with \nrespect to route pay by briefly arguing that Plaintiffs’ reference to route pay is unclear, that is \nsimply not the case. Not only does Plaintiffs’ brief devote an entire section to detail how the \nimposition of the route pay condition is unlawful (ECF No. 5-1 at 33-34), but Plaintiffs’ Motion \nexpressly requests relief in the form of ordering Defendants to “[r]emoving the route pay grant \nconditions from TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.” ECF No. 5 at 2. Plaintiffs’ request is clear, as is its \nright to relief, and so Plaintiffs continue to request that its right to preliminary relief sought in its \nmotion not be impaired by the Department unlawfully placing further roadblocks in the way of \ntheir continued access to grant funding. \nIII.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, and the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in \nSupport of Their Motion for Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the Court enter a preliminary injunction consistent with its request.  \n \n14 \nAPPENDIX Page 56\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 18 of 19\n \nDated: March 12, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Joshua W.B.

(ECF No. 5; the “Motion.”)  Following expedited briefing by the parties, the court \nconvened  a  hearing  on  the  Motion  on  March  13,  2025.    For  the  reasons  that  follow,  by \naccompanying order, Plaintiffs’ Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (“AACTE”), National \nCenter for Teacher Residencies (“NCTR”), and the Maryland Association of Colleges for Teacher \nEducation (“MACTE”) initiated this action on March 5, 2025.  (ECF No. 1; the “Complaint.”)  \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise from the Department of Education’s (the “Department”) termination of \ngrants awarded through its Teacher Quality Partnership Program (“TQP”), Supporting Effective \nEducator Development Program (“SEED”), and the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program \n(“TSL”) (collectively, the “Grant Programs”).  \nAPPENDIX Page 58\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 2 of 48\nA.  Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs AACTE, NCTR, and MACTE are composed of members that provide teacher \npreparation programs throughout the United States.  (ECF No. 1 at p. 2.)   \nPlaintiff AACTE is the largest membership organization dedicated to educator preparation \nin the United States.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 12.)  Its hundreds of members include public and private \ncolleges and universities, as well as nonprofit organizations.  Id.  AACTE members work with \nteachers, counselors, pre-Kindergarten through grade 12 administrators, and college faculty.  Id.  \nAACTE shares its membership organization’s research, policy insights, and best practices with \nprofessional educators to further its mission of “elevat[ing] education and educator preparation \nthrough research, professional practice, advocacy, and collaboration.”  Id.  Fifty-four AACTE \nmembers, including five located in Maryland, were awarded TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.  (ECF \nNo. 5-3 ¶¶ 5, 6.)   \nNCTR’s members include colleges, universities, and nonprofit teaching organizations \nacross the United States.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 13.)  Its mission is “to transform educator preparation by \nadvancing the teacher residency movement to prepare, support, and retain more effective educators \nwho represent and value the communities they serve.”  Id.   NCTR “supports the design of new \nteacher residency programs and provides consulting to strengthen existing programs across the \nUnited States.”  Id.  NCTR’s members use grant money, including from the Grant Programs, to \n“reduce tuition costs for aspiring teachers called teacher residents, pay host K-12 teachers for the \nwork they are doing to support the aspiring teachers, offset the cost for licensure examinations and \ntest prep workshops, and provide a stipend or pay for work the teacher residents are completing \nthrough their internships.”  Id.  Twenty-five NCTR members received SEED, TQP, and/or TSL \nAPPENDIX Page 59\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 3 of 48\ngrant awards; and in 2022, the Department awarded NCTR a three-year SEED grant.  (NCTR \nDecl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 5–6.)    \nMACTE is a membership organization with a mission “to serve as a distinct statewide \nvoice on matters of importance to educator preparation programs at Maryland’s colleges and \nuniversities.” (ECF No. 1 ¶ 14.)  MACTE’s members are “college and universities engaged in the \npreparation of professional school personnel with state program approval.”  Id.  All of MACTE’s \nmembers are located in Maryland.  (ECF No. 5-3 ¶ 6.)  Three of MACTE’s 10 members received \nTQP and SEED grants.  Id. ¶ 7.  These TQP and SEED grant recipients use their grant awards to \nrecruit, retain, and support teachers in Maryland.  Id. ¶ 5.  \nB.  The Grant Programs \nThe Grant Programs’ authorizing statutes reserve funds for the Secretary of the Department \n(the “Secretary”) to award grants on a competitive basis to provide funding for specified purposes.  \nAccording to the statute, TQP grant funds shall be used for “carry[ing] out a program for the \npreparation of teachers . . ., a teaching residency . . ., or a combination of such programs” that \ninclude certain requirements specified in 20 U.S.C. § 1022a(d) and (e).  20 U.S.C. § 1022a(c)(1).   \nSEED provides grants for the purposes of:  \n(1) providing teachers, principals, or  other school leaders from \nnontraditional preparation and certification routes or pathways to \nserve in traditionally underserved local educational agencies; \n(2) providing evidence-based professional development activities \nthat address literacy, numeracy, remedial, or other needs of local \neducational agencies and the students the agencies serve; \n(3)  providing  teachers,  principals,  or  other  school  leaders  with \nprofessional  development  activities  that  enhance  or  enable  the \nprovision of postsecondary coursework through dual or concurrent \nenrollment programs and early college high school settings across a \nlocal educational agency; \n(4) making freely available services and learning opportunities to \nlocal educational agencies, through partnerships and cooperative \nAPPENDIX Page 60\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 4 of 48\nagreements or by making the services or opportunities publicly \naccessible through electronic means; or \n(5)  providing  teachers,  principals,  or  other  school  leaders  with \nevidence-based  professional  enhancement  activities,  which  may \ninclude activities that lead to an advanced credential. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 6672(a).   \nTSL provides grants to “eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or expand \nperformance-based compensation systems or human capital management systems, in schools \nserved by the eligible entity.”  20 U.S.C.  § 6631(a).  TSL’s authorizing statute describes its \npurposes as follows: \n(1)  to  assist  States,  local  educational  agencies,  and  nonprofit \norganizations  to  develop,  implement,  improve,  or  expand \ncomprehensive performance-based compensation systems or human \ncapital management systems for teachers, principals, or other school \nleaders (especially for teachers, principals, or other school leaders \nin high-need schools) who raise student academic achievement and \nclose  the  achievement  gap  between  high-  and  low-performing \nstudents; and \n(2) to study and review performance-based compensation systems \nor human capital management systems for teachers, principals, or \nother school leaders to evaluate the effectiveness, fairness, quality, \nconsistency, and reliability of the systems. \n \nId. § 6631. \n  Per their authorizing statutes, SEED and TSL awards provide grants for periods of “not \nmore than 3 years.”  20 U.S.C. §§ 6672(b)(1), 6632(b)(1).  TQP awards provide grants for periods \nup to five years.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 4.) \nC.  The Application Process  \n \nThe Grant Programs’ authorizing statutes set forth grant application procedures.  20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1022a(b), 6672(d), 6632(c).  The statutory application process for the Grant Programs (set forth \nin Title 20 of the United States Code, titled “Education”) is implemented in accordance with the \nCode of Federal Regulations, Title 34, which governs the Department specifically.  According to \nAPPENDIX Page 61\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 5 of 48\nthe regulations adopted to implement the statutory application process for the Grant Programs, the \nSecretary is required to publish proposed and final “Annual absolute, competitive preference, and \ninvitational priorities” in the Federal Register.  34 C.F.R. § 75.105.  The applicable regulations \nalso require that the Secretary’s proposed priorities go through public comment rule making except \nin the following circumstances: \n(i) The final annual priorities will be implemented only by inviting \napplications that meet the priorities; \n(ii) The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of priorities \nalready established in the program’s regulations; \n(iii) Publishing proposed annual priorities would seriously interfere \nwith an orderly, responsible grant award process or would otherwise \nbe impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest; \n(iv) The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to \nestablish specified priorities; or \n(v)  The  annual  priorities  are  chosen  from  allowable  activities \nspecified in the program statute. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2).  Once the priorities are established through notice and comment, they \nmust then be published in a notice in the  Federal Register, usually in the Notice  Inviting \nApplications seeking grant applicants.  Id. § 75.105(a).  \n  The Department is subject to additional rule making requirements under the General \nEducation Provisions Act (“GEPA”) at 20 U.S.C. § 1232.  Important here, GEPA carves out \nDepartment priority notice and comment rule making, including as applied to the Grant Programs \nstatutory application process, from the Administrative Procedure Act’s (“APA”) more generalized \nexemption of grant-related matters from public notice and comment rule making requirements.  5 \nU.S.C. § 553(a)(2).  Under GEPA,  \nThe exemption for . . . grants and benefits in section 553(a)(2) of \nTitle 5 [of the APA] shall apply only to regulations-- \n(1)  that  govern  the  first  grant  competition  under  a  new  or \nsubstantially  revised  program  authority  as  determined  by  the \nSecretary; or \nAPPENDIX Page 62\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 6 of 48\n(2) where the Secretary determines that the requirements of this \nsubsection will cause extreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries \nof the program affected by such regulations. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1232(d).   \nFor purposes of § 1232(d), a “regulation” is “any generally applicable rule, regulation, \nguideline, interpretation, or other requirement that (1) is prescribed by the Secretary or the \nDepartment; and (2) has legally binding effect in connection with, or affecting, the provision of \nfinancial assistance under any applicable program.”  20 U.S.C. § 1232(a).  “Applicable program” \nmeans “any program for which the Secretary or the Department has administrative responsibility \nas provided by law or by delegation of authority pursuant to law.”  Id. § 1221(c)(1).  \n  Here, Plaintiffs’ members that received (now terminated) TQP, TSL, and SEED grants \n(“Grant Recipients”)1 were selected to receive funding (“Grant Awards”) from FY 2020, 2022, \nand 2024 TQP Grants; FY 2022 SEED Grants; and FY 2023 TSL Grants.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 32–34, \n38, 42.)  All Grant Recipients applied for Grant Program awards pursuant to a Notice Inviting \nApplication published in the Federal Register.  For TQP Grant Program awards, Notices Inviting \nApplications appeared at 85 Fed. Reg. 29691–29704; 87 Fed. Reg. 10906–10923; and 89 Fed. \nReg. 23573–23592.  For SEED Grant Program awards, Notices Inviting Applications appeared at \n87 Fed. Reg. 19487–19496.  For TSL Grant Program awards, Notices Inviting Applications \nappeared at 88 Fed. Reg.  33592–33601.  The Notices Inviting Application set forth the Department \npriorities established through the § 75.105 public notice and comment rule making process, to \ninclude the following priorities: “supporting educators and their professional growth,” “increasing \neducator diversity,” “high-need schools,” “addressing the impact of COVID-19 on Students, \nEducators, and Faculty,” “[p]romoting equity in student access to educational resources and \n1 The term “Grant Recipients” includes Plaintiff NCTR.

Change of Administration  \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump was sworn in, for the second time, as President of \nthe United States.  That same day, he signed Executive Order 14151 titled “Ending Radical and \nWasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.”  Exec. Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical \nand Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025).  \nThe “Purpose and Policy” portion of Executive Order 14151 provides:  \nThe Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination \nprograms, going by the name  ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ \n(DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas \nranging from airline safety to the military.  This was a concerted \neffort stemming from President Biden’s first day in office, when he \nissued  Executive  Order  13985,  “Advancing  Racial  Equity  and \nSupport  for  Underserved  Communities  Through  the  Federal \nGovernment.”   \n \nPursuant to Executive Order 13985 and follow-on orders, nearly \nevery Federal agency and entity submitted “Equity Action Plans” to \ndetail the ways that they have furthered DEIs infiltration of the \nFederal Government. The public release of these plans demonstrated \nimmense public waste and shameful discrimination.  That ends \ntoday.  Americans deserve a government committed to serving every \nperson with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious \ntaxpayer resources only on making America great. \n \nId. § 1, Purpose and Policy. \nAPPENDIX Page 64\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 8 of 48\nOf import here, Executive Order 14151 mandates the termination of, inter alia, certain \ngrants and programs as follows:  \n(b) Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation \nwith the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director \nof OPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty \ndays of this order: \n \n(i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all \nDEI,  DEIA,  and  “environmental  justice”  offices  and \npositions  (including  but  not  limited  to  “Chief  Diversity \nOfficer”  positions);  all  “equity  action  plans,”  “equity” \nactions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” grants or \ncontracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements \nfor employees, contractors, or grantees. \n \nId. § 2(b)(1), Implementation.2   \n  On February 3, 2025, three membership associations (none a plaintiff here) and the City of \nBaltimore  filed  action  in  this  court  against  President  Trump,  the  Acting  Secretary  of  the \nDepartment, and the Acting Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, \nCommerce, Agriculture, and Energy, and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior.

Mar. 10, 2025) \n  Following Executive Order 14151, but before the NADOHE preliminary injunction, the \nDepartment’s Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development issued an internal directive \n(the “Directive”) titled “Eliminating Discrimination and Fraud in Department Grant Awards.”3  \n(ECF No. 24-2.)  The Directive, dated February 5, 2025, was signed by Acting Secretary of the \nDepartment Denise L. Carter.  Id.  The Directive begins:  \nFrom the Supreme Court’s 1954 landmark opinion in Brown v. \nBoard  of  Education  to  its  2023  decision  in  Students  for  Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. Fellows of Harvard College, education has \nplayed a central role in this Nation’s fight against discrimination. It \nremains a priority of the Department of Education to eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. This includes ensuring that the Department’s grants do not \nsupport programs or organizations that promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives or any other \ninitiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic. \nIllegal DEI policies and practices can violate both the letter and \npurpose  of  Federal  civil  rights  law  and  conflict  with  the \nDepartment’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence \nin education. In addition to complying with the civil rights laws, it \nis vital that the Department assess whether all grant payments are \nfree from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to assess whether \ncurrent grants are in the best interests of the United States. \n \nId.  \nThrough the Directive, the Department instructed its personnel as follows:   \nFor these reasons, pursuant to, among other authorities, 20 U.S.C. § \n3411 and 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–341, the Secretary of Education \nhereby directs as follows: \n \n3 The Directive was offered by Defendants as an exhibit to their opposition to the Motion and was referenced by \ndefense counsel at the hearing over no objection.  At the hearing, defense counsel explained, over no objection by \nopposing counsel, that the Directive was made public by way of a social media post that was not at the direction, or \nwith the permission, of Acting Secretary Carter. In other words, it was leaked.  Plaintiffs offer no challenge to its \nauthenticity.

Such  review  shall  be  limited  to  ensuring  that \nDepartment grants do not fund discriminatory practices—including \nin  the  form  of  DEI—that  are  either  contrary  to  law  or  to  the \nDepartment’s policy objectives, as well as to ensure that all grants \nare free from fraud, abuse, and duplication. \n \nId.  See also Oglesby Decl., Hearing Ex. No. 2 ¶ 5.  The Directive makes no mention of President \nTrump, Executive Order 14151, or any other Executive Order.   \nE.  February 2025 Termination  \nIn early February 2025, the majority of Grant Recipients received a letter from the \nDepartment, which reads:  \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation  is  terminating  your  federal  award,  [Grant  Award \nnumber]. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340–43; see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.523. \n \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment's grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education. In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess whether current grants are in the best interests of the United \nStates. \n \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \nAPPENDIX Page 67\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 11 of 48\nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States. The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer \neffectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see \nalso  34  C.F.R.  §  75.253.  Therefore,  pursuant  to,  among  other \nauthorities, 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the \ntermination provisions in your grant award, the Department hereby \nterminates grant No. [___] in its entirety effective [February ___, \n2025]. \n \n(ECF No. 1-2; the “Termination Letter.”) \n \nIn addition to the Termination Letter, Grant Recipients received updated Grant Award \nNotifications (“GANs”).  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 5.)  The GANs contained information regarding the Grant \nRecipient, Grant Project award information, project staff and title, key personnel, award periods, \nauthorized periods, authorized funding, administrative information, legislative and fiscal data, and \nterms and conditions.  (ECF No. 1-1.)  The updated GANs read: “[t]his grant is deemed to be \ninconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a)(4); \nsee also 34 C.F.R. 75.253.”  Id.  \n Since the Termination Letters were issued, Plaintiffs and their member organizations have \nstopped receiving their Grant Award funds.  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 11.)  As a result, Plaintiffs’ member \norganizations are unable to continue their work, which directly effects thousands of students and \neducators, and threatens the existence of Grant Recipients’ programs.

In full, the February  \n2025 Press Release reads:  \nThe  U.S.  Department  of  Education  today  announced  it  has \nterminated over $600 million in grants to institutions and nonprofits \nthat were using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education \nagencies  on  divisive  ideologies.  Training  materials  included \ninappropriate and unnecessary topics such as Critical Race Theory; \nDiversity,  Equity,  and  Inclusion  (DEI);  social  justice  activism; \n“anti-racism”;  and  instruction  on  white  privilege  and  white \nsupremacy. Additionally, many of these grants included teacher and \nstaff recruiting strategies implicitly and explicitly based on race. \n \nThe grants are awarded to teacher preparation programs that train \nfuture classroom teachers. Examples from the grant applications \nincluded: \n•  Requiring  practitioners  to  take  personal  and  institutional \nresponsibility for systemic inequities (e.g., racism) and critically \nreassess their own practices;  \n•  Receiving  professional  development  workshops  and  equity \ntraining on topics such as “Building Cultural Competence,” \n“Dismantling  Racial  Bias”  and  “Centering  Equity  in  the \nClassroom”; \n•  Acknowledging and responding to systemic forms of oppression \nand  inequity,  including  racism,  ableism,  “gender-based” \ndiscrimination, homophobia, and ageism; \n•  Providing  “targeted  practices  in  culturally  relevant  and \nresponsive  teaching  abolitionist  pedagogies  and  issues  of \ndiversity in classroom management”; and \n•  Providing  spaces  for  critical  reflection  to  help  educators \nconfront biases and have transformative conversations about \nequity. \n4 The February 2025 Press Release is available on the Department’s website at https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-\nrelease/us-department-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-divisive-teacher-training-grants  (last  visited  Mar.  17, \n2025).   \nAPPENDIX Page 69\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 13 of 48\n \nId.   \nF.  Resulting Litigation  \nFollowing issuance of the Termination Letters, at least two lawsuits were filed to challenge \nthe Department’s termination of the Grant Awards.  On March 3, 2025, Plaintiffs filed the instant \naction asserting that the Department’s termination of their members’ TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant \nAwards violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Count I) and the APA (Count \nII).5  (ECF No. 1.)  That same day, Plaintiffs filed the Motion for temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction to reinstate the terminated Grant Awards and to enjoin Defendants from \nterminating other Grant Awards under the same rationale.  (ECF No. 5.)  On March 5, 2025, the \ncourt convened a status conference with the parties.  The parties agreed to treat the Motion as one \nfor preliminary injunction only (in lieu of first addressing the motion for temporary restraining \norder) and, with the parties’ consent, the court set an expedited briefing schedule and scheduled a \nhearing.  (ECF No. 18.)  On March 13, 2025, the parties appeared for a hearing on the Motion. \nAfter the instant case was filed, but before the hearing on the Motion, the states of \nCalifornia,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  Colorado,  Illinois,  New  York,  Wisconsin,  and  the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts joined as plaintiffs to file suit in the United States District Court \nfor the District of Massachusetts (Civil Case No. 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ; the “California case”).  The \nCalifornia plaintiffs allege the Department, Secretary McMahon, and former Acting Secretary \nCarter violated the APA by terminating TQP and SEED Grant Awards.  On March 10, 2025, the \npresiding judge, the Honorable Myong J. Joun, entered a temporary restraining order as follows: \n1. Defendants shall immediately restore Plaintiff States to the pre-\nexisting status quo prior to the termination under all previously \nawarded TQP or SEED grants for recipients in Plaintiff States;  \n5 Plaintiff NCTR seeks redress of termination of its own grant, as well as of those of its members.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ \n65–76.) \nAPPENDIX Page 70\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 14 of 48\n \n2. Defendants are temporarily enjoined from implementing, giving \neffect to, maintaining, or reinstating under a different name the \ntermination of any previously awarded TQP or SEED grants for \nrecipients in Plaintiff States, including but not limited to through the \nTermination  Letter,  Termination  GAN,  and  any  other  agency \nactions  implementing  such  terminations,  such  as  suspension  or \nwithholding of any funds approved and obligated for the grants;  \n \n3.  Defendants  are  temporarily  enjoined  from  terminating  any \nindividual TQP and SEED grant for recipients in Plaintiff States, \nexcept to the extent the final agency action is consistent with the \nCongressional  authorization  and  appropriations,  relevant  federal \nstatute, including the requirements of the APA, the requirements of \nthe  relevant  implementing  regulations,  the  grant  terms  and \nconditions, and this Court’s Order;  \n \n4. Within 24 hours of entry of this Order, Defendants shall provide \nnotice of the TRO to their employees and anyone acting in concert \nwith them, and to all TQP and SEED grantees in Plaintiff States;  \n \n5. Defendants shall file a status report with the Court, within 24 \nhours of entry of this Order, confirming their compliance with the \nCourt’s TRO;  \n \n6. This TRO shall become effective immediately upon entry by this \nCourt. The TRO shall remain in effect for 14 days; and  \n \n7. By March 11, 2025 at 5 P.M., the parties shall jointly propose a \nbriefing schedule regarding Plaintiff States’ request for preliminary \ninjunction. \n \nCalifornia v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825, \nat *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  The California defendants filed a notice of appeal of the temporary \nrestraining order the following day.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.  “A \npreliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy’ that ‘may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.’”  Pierce v. N. Carolina State Bd. of Elections, \nAPPENDIX Page 71\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 15 of 48\n97 F.4th 194, 209 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 \n(2008)); see Benisek v. Lamone, 585 U.S. 155, 158 (2018) (noting that “a preliminary injunction \nis ‘an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right’”).  As such, preliminary injunctive relief is \nto be “granted only sparingly and in limited circumstances.”   St. Michael’s Media, Inc. v. Mayor \n& City Council of Baltimore, 566 F. Supp. 3d 327, 351 (D. Md. 2021), aff’d, No. 21-2158, 2021 \nWL 6502219 (4th Cir. Nov. 3, 2021), and aff’d, No. 21-2206, 2021 WL 6502220 (4th Cir. Nov. \n13, 2021) (quoting Micro Strategy, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 245 F.3d 335, 339 (4th Cir. 2001)).   \nA plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief “must establish that 1) they are likely to \nsucceed on the merits; 2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief; 3) the \nbalance of the equities favors the requested injunctive relief; and 4) that relief is in the public \ninterest.”  Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle v. Baltimore Police Dep’t, 2 F.4th 330, 339 (4th Cir. \n2021) (citing In re Search Warrant Issued June 13, 2019, 942 F.3d 159, 170–71 (4th Cir. 2019)). \nThese factors were established by the Supreme Court in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008).   “[P]laintiff bears the burden of establishing that each of these \nfactors supports granting the injunction.”6  Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 \nF.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991) (citing cases); see St. Michael’s Media, Inc., 566 F. Supp. 3d at 351 \n(same). \n \n \n    \n6 “Because preliminary injunction proceedings are informal ones designed to prevent irreparable harm before a later \ntrial governed by the full rigor of usual evidentiary standards, district courts may look to, and indeed in appropriate \ncircumstances rely on, hearsay or other inadmissible evidence when deciding whether a preliminary injunction is \nwarranted.”  St. Michael’s Media, Inc. v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, 566 F. Supp. 3d 327, 352 (D. Md. 2021), \naff’d, No. 21-2158, 2021 WL 6502219 (4th Cir. Nov. 3, 2021), and aff’d, No. 21-2206, 2021 WL 6502220 (4th Cir. \nNov. 13, 2021) (quoting G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 725–26 (4th Cir. 2016)).   \nAPPENDIX Page 72\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 16 of 48\nIII.  ANALYSIS  \nA.  Jurisdictional Matters \n1.  Standing  \nThe  Constitution  extends  the  judicial  power  of  Article  III  courts  to  “cases”  or \n“controversies.”  U.S. CONST. ART. III, § 2, cl. 1.  The doctrine of standing, among others, \n“implements” this limit.  Carney v. Adams, 592 U.S. 53, 58 (2020).  Accordingly, as a threshold \nmatter, the court must determine whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action.  To establish \nstanding: \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact that is both \nconcrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural \nor hypothetical. Second, the plaintiff's injury must be fairly traceable \nto the challenged action of the defendant, meaning that there must \nbe  a  causal  connection  between  the  injury  and  the  conduct \ncomplained  of.  Third,  it  must  be  likely,  as  opposed  to  merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. \n \nDep’t. of Educ v. Brown, 600 U.S. 551, 561 (2023) (citations omitted) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)). \n  In TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, the Supreme Court explained that when determining if a \nplaintiff meets the concrete-harm requirement, “courts should assess whether the alleged injury to \nthe plaintiff has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm ‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis for \na lawsuit in American courts.”  594 U.S. 413, 424 (2021) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. \n330, 341 (2016)).  Traditional tangible harms include physical and monetary harms or losses.  Id. \nat 425. \n  Membership organizations, like Plaintiffs, may establish standing based on their own \ninjury or based on their members’ injuries; the latter standing basis is known as representational \nAPPENDIX Page 73\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 17 of 48\nor associational standing.  Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard \nColl., 600 U.S. 181, 199 (2023).  \n As  referenced  in  Section  I.E.,  above,  Plaintiffs  allege  the  following  facts  in  their \nComplaint and through affidavits (or declarations) of relevant persons with knowledge: \nIn 2022, Plaintiff NCTR received a three-year SEED grant.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 65–76; NCTR \nDecl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 6.)  On February 10, 2025, NCTR received a Termination Letter from the \nDepartment informing it that its SEED grant was terminated for no longer effectuating Department \npriorities.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 6–7; NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 10, 11.)  That same day, the \nDepartment stopped funding NCTR’s grant. (NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 14, pp. 14–15.)  Without \nthe SEED grant funding, NCTR will be unable to engage in its core activities, including operating \nteacher residency programs and conducting research regarding best practices for teacher training.  \n(ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 65–71; NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 12, 17–19.)  Accordingly, as a direct result of \nthe  Department’s  termination  decision,  NCTR  suffered  monetary  harm,  and  a  decision  in \nPlaintiffs’ favor, finding the Department’s termination illegal and reinstating NCTR’s SEED grant \nwould remedy NCTR’s alleged harm.  Plaintiff NCTR has sufficiently demonstrated standing to \nbring this action.   \nPlaintiffs AACTE and MACTE assert representational standing through their members.  \n(ECF No. 1 ¶ 4.)7   AACTE and MACTE’s members “together comprise hundreds of teacher \npreparation programs throughout the United States.”  Id. at p. 2.  Their members received TQP, \nSEED, and TSL grants from the Department that remained active until the February 2025 \nTermination Letters.  Id. at pp. 6–7.  To establish representational standing, “an organization must \ndemonstrate that ‘(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \n7 Plaintiff NCTR also seeks relief for its members, including without limitation NCTR member and (now terminated) \nTQP Grant Recipient Alder Graduate School of Education.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 14; ECF No. 5-8.) \nAPPENDIX Page 74\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 18 of 48\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.’” \nStudents for Fair Admissions, 600 U.S. at 181. (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. \nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  An organization need only “make specific allegations \nestablishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.”  S. Walk at \nBroadlands Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 184 (4th \nCir. 2013) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 (2009)). \nAACTE member organizations received TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.  (ECF No. 1 at p. 2; \nsee supra re Declarations at ECF Nos. 5-6, 5-7, 5-8, and 5-9).  AACTE’s members’ grants \nremained active through early to mid-February 2025 until receipt of the Termination Letter.  Id. at \npp. 3–4.  Among those grants terminated was AU’s TQP grant.  Id. ¶ 77; see also Section I.E., \nsupra.  As a result of the termination and corresponding loss of funding, AU is no longer able to \nrecruit participants to its teacher-training residency program and, if the funding is not reinstated, \nAU will shut down the program.  Id. ¶¶ 83–86.  Accordingly, at least one AACTE member has \nstanding to bring this action in its own right.   \nAACTE’s mission is “to elevate education and educator preparation through research, \nprofessional practice, advocacy, and collaboration.”  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 12.)  The Department’s \ntermination  of  the  Grant  Awards  “directly  threatens  this  mission,”  as  “[t]hese  grants  fund \ninitiatives  that  benefit  PK-12  students  and  schools  nationwide  by  supporting  innovative \napproaches to educator preparation and professional development.”  Id.  AACTE, therefore, \nsatisfies the second prong of representational standing.  Finally, the claims presented and relief \nrequested here concern the legality of the Department’s termination decision and do not require \nthis  court  to  consider  “the  individual  circumstances  of  any  aggrieved”  Plaintiff  member \nAPPENDIX Page 75\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 19 of 48\norganization.  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. V. Brock, \n477 U.S. 274, 287 (1986).     \nAccording to the Complaint, Plaintiff MACTE’s member organizations also received \nGrant Program awards and Termination Letters.  (ECF No. 1 at pp. 2–4.)  Further, according to \nthe record before the court, the Department terminated grants awarded to MACTE members \nTowson University, University of Maryland, and Frostburg State University, causing “a substantial \nloss of funds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland.”  (ECF No. 25-1 ¶¶ 5–9.)  Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs fail adequately to allege MACTE’s standing in the Complaint and may not \nsalvage such defect through supplemental declarations or its reply in support of the Motion.  The \ncourt is satisfied that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege MACTE’s standing in the Complaint, and \nreiterate MACTE’s standing in the Motion.   \nSpecifically, the Complaint (ECF No. 1) at page 2 avers that MACTE members received \nGrant Awards; at pages 3 and 4, the Complaint alleges that these grants remained active through \nmid-February 2025 until they were terminated by the Department through the Termination Letters; \nthe Complaint at paragraph 4 defines “Grant Recipients” to include MACTE members; and the \nComplaint at paragraph 14 alleges that the Department’s grant terminations impact MACTE’s core \nmission, and that TQP and SEED Grant Awards support teachers in Maryland.  These allegations \nare supported by MACTE President Dr. Laurie Mullen’s attestation that three of MACTE’s 10 \nmembers received TQP and SEED grants; the Department terminated the grants; and the grant \nterminations caused a substantial loss of funds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland. \n(MACTE Decl., ECF No. 5-5 ¶¶ 6–7.)  Further, Plaintiffs allege that the Department’s Grant \nProgram terminations “implicated MACTE’s core mission,” as MACTE “serves the institutions of \nhigher education in Maryland for both the recruitment and retention of future teachers as well as \nAPPENDIX Page 76\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 20 of 48\nthe support and advancement of current classroom teachers.”  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 14.)  Finally, for the \nsame reasons identified in relation to AACTE, the court discerns no cause for it to consider the \nindividual  circumstances  of  MACTE’s  members.    Accordingly,  MACTE  satisfies  all  the \nrequirements of organizational standing.   \nAs a separate but related issue, Defendants also argue Plaintiff MACTE lacks standing \nbecause Judge Joun’s temporary restraining order in the California case (issued March 10, 2025, \nseven days after the instant action was filed) ordered the Department to restore terminated TQP \nand  SEED  grants  to  recipients  in  Maryland,  which  effectively  covers  MACTE’s  allegedly \naggrieved members.  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-10548, — F. Supp. 3d. — , \n2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  This is wrong-headed.  Standing “is concerned \nwith the presence of injury, causation, and redressability at the time a complaint is filed,” whereas \nmootness “scrutinizes the presence of these elements after filing—i.e., at the time of a court’s \ndecision.”  Garcia v. U.S. Citizenship & Immgr. Servs., 168 F. Supp. 3d 50, 65 (D.D.C. 2016).  As \nmentioned, the Complaint here was filed March 3, 2025, a week before the California case TRO.  \n(ECF No. 1.)  Judge Joun’s order does not impair MACTE’s standing here.   \nMoreover, the California TRO does not render MACTE’s (or any Plaintiff’s) claims moot.  \n“A case becomes moot—and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for purposes of Article \nIII—'when issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in \nthe outcome.’”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 \nU.S. 478, 481 (1982)).  A “case is moot if the dispute ‘is no longer embedded in any actual \ncontroversy about the plaintiffs’ particular legal rights.’”  Id. (quoting Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. \n87, 93 (2009)).  This is not the situation at hand.   \nAPPENDIX Page 77\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 21 of 48\nTemporary restraining orders exist to prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or \ndamage by preserving the status quo until the court considers whether to order preliminary \ninjunctive relief (or terminate the TRO).  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(b)(1)(A).  As its name suggests, a \ntemporary restraining order is temporary; unless extended, the order expires within 14 days of \nentry.  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(b)(2).   Rule 65 contemplates the importance of proceeding expeditiously \nfrom entry of a TRO to a preliminary injunction hearing.  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(b)(3).  Indeed, courts \nare instructed to prioritize a preliminary injunction hearing following a TRO granted without \nnotice above all other matters.  Id.  A preliminary injunction provides more lasting relief than a \nTRO; it serves to prevent irreparable harm during the pendency of litigation, and to preserve the \ncourt’s ability to render meaningful judgment and relief on the merits.  In re Microsoft Corp. \nAntitrust Litig., 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003).  While Plaintiffs here, and those in the \nCalifornia case, pursued emergency relief, Judge Joun’s TRO does not, indeed cannot, resolve the \nparties’  disputes.    Against  this  backdrop,  the  question  of  the  legality  of  the  Department’s \ntermination of MACTE members’ TQP and SEED grants remains very much alive and appropriate \nfor this court to consider pursuant to Article III. \n2.  Judicial Review  \nThe APA waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity to permit judicial review \nof agency action in limited circumstances.  5 U.S.C. § 705.  Such review is available in suits \nbrought by “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action” who seeks “relief other than money damages.”  Id.  Importantly, \njudicial review is limited to “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.”  Id. § 704.  “Because ‘sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature,’ finality under the \nAPA is a jurisdictional requirement.”  Jake’s Fireworks Inc. v. United States Consumer Prod. \nAPPENDIX Page 78\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 22 of 48\nSafety Comm’n, 105 F.4th 627, 631 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting City of New York v. U.S. Dep’t of \nDef., 913 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir. 2019)). \nAgency action is “final” when two conditions are met: (1) “the action must mark the \n‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision making process—it must not be of a merely tentative or \ninterlocutory nature,” and (2) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been \ndetermined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–\n78 (1997) (quoting Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948), \nand Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass’n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatl., 400 U.S. 62, 71 \n(1970)); see Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 808 (2022) (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178). \n  The parties agree, as does the court, that the Department’s termination of the subject TQP, \nSEED,  and  TSL  Grant  Awards  constituted  final  agency  action.    Each  Termination  Letter \nrepresented that the Department had concluded its review of the grant in question.  (ECF No. 1-2).  \nThe Department’s Termination Letters immediately produced legal consequences for the Grant \nRecipients; the Grant Recipients could no longer access the funds allotted to them by the Grant \nAwards.  See Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-239 (LLA), — F. \nSupp. 3d — , 2025 WL 368852, at *10 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (finding Office of Management and \nBudget memorandum directing federal agencies to temporarily pause disbursement of federal \nfinancial assistance and to freeze all such funds “immediately produced legal consequences across \nthe entire federal funding system”).      \nB.  Venue \nWhere, as here, a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States, a plaintiff may \nbring its claims in any judicial district in which: \n(A) a defendant in the action resides,  \nAPPENDIX Page 79\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 23 of 48\n(B) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the \nsubject of the action is situated, or  \n(C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.  \n \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \n  Although they need only establish one of the above recited circumstances, Plaintiffs aver \nvenue is proper in this district because “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claims occurred in the District of Maryland, and Plaintiff MACTE resides in this district.”  \n(ECF No. 1 ¶ 11.)  Further, under § 1391(e)(1)(C), venue in the District of Maryland is proper \nbecause no real property is involved, Plaintiff MACTE resides in this district, and Defendant \nMcMahon, as the Department Secretary, is an officer of the United States. \n Even if Defendant MACTE lacked standing or was not a party to this action, per § \n1391(e)(1)(B), Plaintiffs ably demonstrate that “a substantial part of the events . . . giving rise to \nthe claim occurred” in Maryland.  “[I]t is possible for venue to be proper in more than one judicial \ndistrict;” the question for the court under § 1391(e)(1)(B) is not whether a given district is the best \nvenue, but whether the events or omissions that occurred there are “sufficiently substantial.”  \nMitrano v. Hawes, 377 F.3d 402, 405 (4th Cir. 2004).  In considering “whether events or omissions \nare sufficiently substantial to support venue . . . , a court should not focus only on those matters \nthat are in dispute or that directly led to the filing of the action.” Id. at 406 (citation omitted).  \nInstead, the court “should review ‘the entire sequence of events underlying the claim.’” Id.; accord \nBrito v.

Md. 2017)).  \nHere, the facts alleged make clear there is more than one relevant “event that occurred in \nMaryland;”  further,  the  Maryland  events  do  not  “appear[]  to  be  unsubstantial.”    Tusha  v. \nGreenfield, No. CV GLR-20-2143, 2021 WL 1530211, at *5 (D.

The \nterminations, it is competently alleged, will produce a substantial loss of funds and related \nprogramming for teacher preparation programs in Maryland.  Id. \nC.  Request for Preliminary Injunction  \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must make a clear showing that he is likely \nto succeed at trial and to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.”  Pierce v. N. \nCarolina State Bd. of Elections, 97 F.4th 194, 210 (4th Cir. 2024) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 22 (2008)).  Plaintiffs contend they are likely to succeed on the merits \nof both their Fifth Amendment and APA claims.  The court addresses each in turn.   \na.  Fifth Amendment Due Process Claim – Vagueness \nAmong its many protections, the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall “be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. AMEND. V.  The \nrequirement of clarity is “essential to the protections provided by the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012).  “It is a basic \nprinciple of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly \nAPPENDIX Page 81\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 25 of 48\ndefined.”8  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).  Where a law is impermissibly \nvague, it must be invalidated.  Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253.   \n“In our constitutional order, a vague law is no law at all.”  United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. \n445, 447 (2019).  As the Supreme Court has explained:  \nOur doctrine prohibiting the enforcement of vague laws rests on the \ntwin constitutional pillars of due process and separation of powers. \n. . . Vague laws contravene the “first essential of due process of law” \nthat statutes must give people “of common intelligence” fair notice \nof what the law demands of them. . . . Vague laws also undermine \nthe Constitution’s separation of powers and the democratic self-\ngovernance it aims to protect. \n \nId. at 451 (first citing Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 183 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in judgment); then quoting Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, \n391 (1926); then citing Collins v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 634, 638 (1914)).  The void-for-vagueness \ndoctrine thus addresses these “two connected but discrete due process concerns”—that “regulated \nparties should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly,” and that “precision \nand  guidance  are  necessary  so  that  those  enforcing  the  law  do  not  act  in  an  arbitrary  or \ndiscriminatory way.”  Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253; see Just Puppies, Inc. v. Frosh, 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 665, 734 (D. Md. 2021), aff’d sub nom. 123 F.4th 652 (4th Cir. 2024) (same).   \n“Fair notice of the law’s demands . . . is ‘the first essential of due process.’”  Dimaya, 584 \nU.S. at 183 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting Connally, 269 \nU.S. at 391).  It is a “fundamental principle in our legal system . . . that laws which regulate persons \nor entities must give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.”  Fox Television, 567 U.S. \n8 As Plaintiffs assert, and this court has previously explained, while challenges to vagueness are often analyzed in the \nstatutory context, the same principles guide consideration of executive orders.  See, e.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity \nOfficers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, — F. Supp. 3d — , No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764, at *19 (D.

Haines, 2 F.4th 298, 316 (4th Cir. 2021) (same).  “[I]f arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who \napply them.”  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.  “A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy \nmatters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the \nattendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.”  Id. at 108–109.  \nWhile “perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required,” see United States \nv. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008) (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794 \n(1989)), “a statute must give a person of ordinary intelligence adequate notice of what conduct is \nprohibited  and  must  include  sufficient  standards  to  prevent  arbitrary  and  discriminatory \nenforcement.”  Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 272–73 (4th Cir. 2019); \nsee Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253 (same).   \nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim rests on allegations that the Termination Provision of  \nExecutive Order 14151 is unconstitutionally vague.9  In order to show they are likely to succeed \non their Fifth Amendment claim, Plaintiffs concede that they must produce evidence that the \nDepartment terminated their members’ Grant Awards pursuant to the Termination Provision of \nExecutive Order 14151.  As will be explained below, Plaintiffs fail to adduce, at this stage, \nsufficient evidence in support of same; as such, they have not met their burden to show a clear \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their Fifth Amendment claim.  The court, therefore, does not \nreach the question of unconstitutional vagueness.  \n9 Plaintiffs ask the court to extend to them the benefit of the NADOHE preliminary injunction through retroactive \napplication.  (ECF No. 5-1 at pp. 17–18; see ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 45-52.)  Their arguments are unavailing for the reasons set \nforth in this opinion and because they fail to overcome the material procedural and substantive differences between \nthe case at bar and NADOHE.  Further, on March 14, 2025, the Fourth Circuit granted the NADOHE defendants’ \nrequest to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.  \nAPPENDIX Page 83\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 27 of 48\nPlaintiffs  allege:  “Plaintiffs  and  their  member  organizations  were  subjected  to  the \nTermination Provision when the Department terminated the grants at issue in this lawsuit under \nthe instructions provided in Executive Order 14151.”  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 155.)  Plaintiffs acknowledge \nthat the Termination Letters did not expressly reference or mention Executive Order 14151, and \nargue that “the Department’s publicly-articulated reason for termination,” as described in the \nFebruary  17,  2025  Press  Release,  offers  competent  circumstantial  evidence  to  support  the \nconclusion that the Department terminated the Grant Awards in obeyance of Executive Order \n14151.  (ECF No. 5-1 at pp. 15, 17–18 .)     \nAs discussed supra, the full February 2025 Press Release reads:  \nThe  U.S.  Department  of  Education  today  announced  it  has \nterminated over $600 million in grants to institutions and nonprofits \nthat were using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education \nagencies  on  divisive  ideologies.  Training  materials  included \ninappropriate and unnecessary topics such as Critical Race Theory; \nDiversity,  Equity,  and  Inclusion  (DEI);  social  justice  activism; \n“anti-racism”;  and  instruction  on  white  privilege  and  white \nsupremacy. Additionally, many of these grants included teacher and \nstaff recruiting strategies implicitly and explicitly based on race. \n \nThe grants are awarded to teacher preparation programs that train \nfuture classroom teachers. Examples from the grant applications \nincluded: \n•  Requiring  practitioners  to  take  personal  and  institutional \nresponsibility for systemic inequities (e.g., racism) and critically \nreassess their own practices;  \n•  Receiving  professional  development  workshops  and  equity \ntraining on topics such as “Building Cultural Competence,” \n“Dismantling  Racial  Bias”  and  “Centering  Equity  in  the \nClassroom”; \n•  Acknowledging and responding to systemic forms of oppression \nand  inequity,  including  racism,  ableism,  “gender-based” \ndiscrimination, homophobia, and ageism; \n•  Providing  “targeted  practices  in  culturally  relevant  and \nresponsive  teaching  abolitionist  pedagogies  and  issues  of \ndiversity in classroom management”; and \nAPPENDIX Page 84\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 28 of 48\n•  Providing  spaces  for  critical  reflection  to  help  educators \nconfront biases and have transformative conversations about \nequity. \n \n(ECF No. 1-4.)   \n  For comparison, the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 provides:  \nEach agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with \nthe Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of \nOPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty \ndays of this order: \n \n(i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, \nand “environmental justice” offices and positions (including but not \nlimited to “Chief Diversity Officer” positions); all “equity action \nplans,” “equity” actions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” \ngrants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements \nfor employees, contractors, or grantees. \n \nExec. Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and \nPreferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025).   \nBeyond referencing “DEI,” the court does not discern substantially similar language, which \nis to say, it is not in fact “clear,” as Plaintiffs allege, that the Department terminated the Grant \nAwards at issue pursuant to the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ \n48.)  Plaintiffs’ papers otherwise offer no other argument or evidence in support of its allegation.  \nAt the hearing, Plaintiffs confirmed that the circumstantial evidence upon which they rely in \nsupport of this allegation is that of timing and presidential authority—the Termination Letters were \nissued within the required timeframe under the Termination Provision (60 days) ordered by \nPresident Trump. \nDefendants also argue that the record before the court demonstrates that the Department \ndid not terminate the Grant Awards as a means to comply with Executive Order 14151, or, \nalternatively, the record sufficiently undermines Plaintiffs’ theory and conclusion that Executive \nAPPENDIX Page 85\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 29 of 48\nOrder 14141 and the Termination Letters (and the February 2025 Press Release) are plainly and \nobviously connected.  The court agrees with Defendants on this point.  The Department’s Directive \ncites as authority 28 U.S.C. § 3411 and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–341, and directs Department \npersonnel to “conduct an internal review of all . . . grants” to “ensur[e] that Department grants do \nnot fund discriminatory practices—including in the form of DEI—that are either contrary to law \nor to the Department’s policy objectives, as well as to ensure that all grants are free from fraud, \nabuse, and duplication.”  (February 2025 Directive, ECF No. 24-2.)  The Directive, as Defendants \nnote, makes no reference to Executive Order 14151 or President Trump.  Further, importantly, the \nDirective preceded the NADOHE preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Termination \nProvision, which is to say, at the time of the Directive, the Department had no incentive or motive \nto omit reference to Executive Order 14151, because the Termination Provision had not yet been \nenjoined in NADOHE.  See NADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, supra.10  \nThe circumstantial evidence offered by Plaintiffs does not demonstrate a clear likelihood \nof  success  on  their  Fifth  Amendment  claim  where  that  claim  necessarily  requires  that  the \nTermination Provision was the source of the Grant Award terminations.  Said another way, the \nrecord before the court at this time fails to demonstrate that the Department likely terminated the \nGrant Awards at the directive of Executive Order 14151.  The evidence Plaintiffs rely upon to rest \nthat conclusion is simply too tenuous to serve as the cornerstone for the extraordinary relief of a \n10 Defendants also point to correspondence offered in the NADOHE case from the FCC Chair stating that the FCC \nwas ending the FCC’s “promotion” of DEI pursuant to the policies expressed in President Trump’s Executive Order.  \nNADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, at *7. \nAPPENDIX Page 86\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 30 of 48\npreliminary injunction.11   As such, Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden to show they are likely to \nsucceed on their Fifth Amendment challenge.12   \nb.  Administrative Procedure Act Claim  \nThe APA instructs a reviewing court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency actions \nfound to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  “A disputed action also may be set aside as arbitrary and capricious if the \nagency has acted ‘without observance of procedure required by law.’”  Safari Club Int’l v. Zinke, \n878 F.3d 316, 325 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (first quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D); then citing Meister v. U.S. \nDep’t of Agric., 623 F.3d 363, 371 (6th Cir. 2010) (noting that “even in cases arising under § \n706(2)(D), the arbitrary-and-capricious standard frequently governs.”)); see also Ctr. for Sci. in \nthe Pub. Int. v. Perdue, 438 F. Supp. 3d 546, 557 (D. Md. 2020) (same).  As discussed above, \njudicial review is appropriate here, as the parties agree, as does the court, that the Termination \nLetters constituted final agency action.   \nIn deciding whether a final agency action is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law,” the reviewing court determines “only whether the \n[agency] examined ‘the relevant data’ and articulated ‘a satisfactory explanation’ for [its] decision, \n‘including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  5 U.S.C. § \n11 Further, as the court expressed at the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiffs neglect to consider that Acting Secretary \nCarter and Secretary McMahon may well share President Trump’s views and opinions regarding DEI and equity-\nbased programs and grants as expressed in Executive Order 14151.  Indeed, one might expect that to be the case.  That \nExecutive Order 14151 may have, by its terms mandated precisely the action taken by the Department in terminating \nthe Grant Awards does not mean the Department terminated the Grant Awards because it was ordered to do so – as \nopposed to because the Department head devised her own action items for the Department going forward; or based on \nsome combination of same. \n12 Because the court concludes Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a clear showing of likelihood of success on the merits on \ntheir Fifth Amendment claim for failure to relate adequately the Termination Letters to the Termination Provision of \nExecutive Order 14151, it does not address Defendants’ arguments related to the principle that “[t]he degree of \nvagueness that the Constitution tolerates—as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement—\ndepends in part on the nature of the enactment.”  Vill. of Hoffman Ests. v. Flipside, Hoffman Ests., Inc., 455 U.S. 489, \n498 (1982).  \nAPPENDIX Page 87\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 31 of 48\n706(2)(A); Dep’t of Commerce v.

Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  \nThe court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.  FCC v. Prometheus \nRadio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).   \nAn agency action qualifies as “arbitrary” or “capricious” if it is not “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.”  Id.  “Generally, an agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if ‘the \nagency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a \ndifference in view or the product of agency expertise.’”  Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of the \nInterior, 899 F.3d 260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43). \n“Deciding whether agency action was adequately explained requires, first, knowing where \nto look for the agency’s explanation.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 \nU.S. 1, 20 (2020).  “It is a ‘foundational principle of administrative law’ that judicial review of \nagency action is limited to ‘the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.’” Id. \n(quoting Michigan v.

S. 743, 758 (2015)); see also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50 (noting \n“[i]t is well-established that an agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by \nthe agency itself”). \nTo remind the reader, the Termination Letters state as follows: \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation  is  terminating  your  federal  award,  [Grant  Award \nnumber].

The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nAPPENDIX Page 88\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 32 of 48\nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment's grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education. In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess whether current grants are in the best interests of the United \nStates. \n \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States. The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer \neffectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see \nalso  34  C.F.R.  §  75.253.  Therefore,  pursuant  to,  among  other \nauthorities, 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the \ntermination provisions in your grant award, the Department hereby \nterminates grant No. [___] in its entirety effective [February ___, \n2025]. \n \n(ECF No. 1-2.) \ni.  Rule Making Requirements \nThe Department primarily relies upon two sections of the Code of Federal Regulations: § \n200.340 and § 75.253.  Sections 200.339 and 341–43, also cited, provide additional notification \nrequirements for terminations described in § 200.340.  At oral argument, Plaintiffs stated, and the \nDefendants did not dispute, that § 75.253 has no application here, because § 75.253 prescribes the \nprocedure for “Continuation of a Multiyear Project after the First Budget Period” – and no Grant \nRecipient was in such a position relative to the Termination Letter.     \nAPPENDIX Page 89\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 33 of 48\nSection 200.340 provides: \n \n(a) The Federal award may be terminated in part or its entirety as \nfollows: \n \n(1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the \nrecipient  or  subrecipient  fails  to  comply  with  the  terms  and \nconditions of the Federal award; \n \n(2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the \nconsent of the recipient or subrecipient, in which case the two parties \nmust  agree  upon  the  termination  conditions.  These  conditions \ninclude the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the \nportion to be terminated; \n \n(3) By the recipient or subrecipient upon sending the Federal \nagency or pass-through entity a written notification of the reasons \nfor such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial \ntermination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal \nagency or pass-through entity determines that the remaining portion \nof the Federal award will not accomplish the purposes for which the \nFederal award was made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity \nmay terminate the Federal award in its entirety; or \n \n(4) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to \nthe terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the \nextent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities. \n \n(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and \nunambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award. \n \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)–(b) (2025). \nThe Grant Recipients’ GANs incorporate § 200.340 in their terms and conditions.13  (ECF \nNo.  25-2.)    Accordingly,  in  compliance  with  §  200.340(b),  the  Department  included  the \n13 In relevant part, the GANs read: “2 CFR Part 200 as adopted at 2 CFR 3474.”  (ECF No. 25-2 at pp. 17, 91.)  Section \n3474.1 is titled “Adoption of 2 CFR part 200” and reads: “(a) The Department of Education adopts the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) Guidance in 2 CFR part 200, except for 200.102(a) and 2 CFR 200.207(a).  Thus, \nthis part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department. \n(b) The authority for all of the provisions in 2 CFR part 200 as adopted in this part is listed as follows. (Authority: 20 \nU.S.C. 1221e-3, 3474, and 2 CFR part 200).”  2 C.F.R. § 3474.1.  \nAPPENDIX Page 90\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 34 of 48\ntermination provisions set forth in § 200.340(a) in the GANs provided to the Grant Recipients.  \nThe parties’ dispute, therefore, concerns whether the February 2025 Grant Terminations complied \nwith § 200.340(a)(4).   \nPlaintiffs argue that “agency priorities” as used in § 200.340(a)(4) and the Termination \nLetters is a term of art.  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 5.)14  As relates to the Department, Plaintiffs insist, \n“agency priorities” cannot be changed without going through public notice and comment rule \nmaking.  Id. at p. 10.  Defendants dispute this contention and instead suggest “agency priorities” \nrefers to broader (“big-picture”) agency policy aims, set by each administration or Secretary, and \nare not required to go through public notice and comment processes.  (ECF No. 24 at pp. 24–25.)  \nDefendants may be correct as it relates to other agencies, but, as discussed below, Plaintiffs \npersuade the court for purposes of the Motion that Department “agency priorities” may change \nonly pursuant to APA notice and comment processes.    \n  In 2020, § 200.340 was amended to allow, for the first time, an agency to terminate a \nfederal award for failure to “effectuate agency priorities.”  Previously, a federal agency was \nentitled to terminate a federal award for the reasons currently listed at § 200.340(a)(1)–(3) or for \ncause.  2 C.F.R. 200.399 (2019).  The comments to this change acknowledge:  \nThe intent of this change is to ensure that Federal awarding agencies \nprioritize ongoing support to Federal awards that meet program \ngoals.  For instance, following the issuance of a Federal award, if \nadditional  evidence  reveals  that  a  specific  award  objective  is \nineffective  at  achieving  program  goals,  it  may  be  in  the \ngovernment’s interest to terminate the Federal award. \n \nGuidance for Grants and Agreements, Published Doc.

No party cites, and the court is unaware of, \nanother instance of the Department terminating federal awards under § 200.340(a)(4).  See ECF \nNo. 24 at p. 26 (noting the “relatively untested” nature of and “paucity of caselaw interpreting” § \n200.340).  \nUnder § 200.340(a)(4), an award termination for failure to effectuate (program goals or) \nagency priorities is limited to “the extent authorized by law.”  With important exceptions the court \nwill shortly address, the APA’s rule making requirements do not apply to “a matter relating to . . . \ngrants.”  5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2).  Critically, this exemption does not apply to the Department.       \n  The General Education Provisions Act (“GEPA”)—(applicable to the Department under \nTitle 20 of the United States Code)—provides: \nThe exemption for . . . grants . . . in section 553(a)(2) of Title 5 shall \napply only to regulations— \n \n(1) that  govern  the  first  grant  competition  under  a  new  or \nsubstantially revised program authority as determined by the \nSecretary; or \nAPPENDIX Page 92\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 36 of 48\n \n(2) where the Secretary determines that the requirements of this \nsubsection  will  cause  extreme  hardship  to  the  intended \nbeneficiaries of the program affected by such regulations. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1232(d).  Neither of these exceptions is present here.  \nA “regulation,” as used in the above section, is “any generally applicable rule, regulation, \nguideline, interpretation, or other requirement that – (1) is prescribed by the Secretary or the \nDepartment; and (2) has legally binding effect in connection with, or affecting, the provision of \nfinancial assistance under any applicable program.”  20 U.S.C. 1232(a).  GEPA thereby limits the \nAPA’s rule making exemption for grants to two circumstances—neither of which applies to the \nGrant Recipients’ awards  .  All other Department regulations, including its “agency priorities,” \nare subject to 5 U.S.C. § 553 notice and comment rule making.15     \n  Defendants’ argument that “Plaintiff’s interpretation of federal regulation renders every \nfederal agency powerless to shift its activities with new Presidential administrations absent a \nlengthy public rulemaking process” ignores GEPA’s specific application to the Department’s \npurported change of “priorities” at issue here.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 26.)  Defendants’ assertion that \nthe “priorities” referred to in the Termination Letters are “general and issued at the discretion of \nthe Agency or the Administration” and “can be changed at any time without a vote or notice and \ncomment from the public” is utterly at odds with GEPA.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 26.)  Under GEPA, \n15 Plaintiffs persuasively explain: “[i]n sum, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department must \ngo through the notice and comment rulemaking process;” “while there are limited exceptions to this rule, none of the \nexceptions are applicable to the analysis here.”  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 5 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d) and 34 C.F.R. § \n75.105(b)(2)); see ECF No. 1 ¶ 24 (“In other words, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department \nmust go through notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the [§ 1232(d)] exceptions applies.”)  \nDefendants do not argue that any exception to the APA rule making process applies here; instead, they argue generally \nthat neither cited authority applies.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 25 (“These provisions do not support Plaintiffs’ argument. § \n1232(d) governs regulations and § 75.105(b)(2) governs annual priorities.”)) Section 75.105 provides instruction for \npriorities used in the selection of grant recipients; it falls under subparts “How To Apply for a Grant” and “The \nApplication Notice.”  Section 1232(d) applies to “regulations,” but Defendants offer no argument why § 200.340(a)(4) \n“agency priorities” are not “regulations” as defined in § 1232(a).  \nAPPENDIX Page 93\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 37 of 48\n‘department priorities’ are established by the Secretary or Department and grant recipients must \nabide them to avoid award cancellation – which is to say, they are legally binding on the federal \naward recipient.  As a matter of law, therefore, such “priorities” – including those on which the \nTermination Letters were based – must go through public notice and comment rule making.   \nThe Grant Recipients’ Grant Awards were terminated upon the Department’s supposed \nfinding that “[t]he grant is . . . inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.”  \n(ECF No. 1-2.)  Nothing in the administrative record before the court supports, or tends to support, \nthis conclusion or the veracity of the statement itself – which is to say, nothing in the record \nsupports, or tends to support, a conclusion that, in fact, any Grant Program award was inconsistent \nwith, or no longer effectuated, Department priorities as had been previously established through \nthe statutorily mandated public notice and comment rule making process.  Nothing before the court \nsupports, or tends to support, a conclusion that in fact the Department reviewed the grant award of \neach Grant Recipient and, on such review, in fact, found it to run afoul of previously lawfully \nestablished “agency priorities.”  Defendants present no evidence of public notice and comment \nrule making through which its priorities (on which the Grant Recipients received their Grant \nAwards) underwent amendment or change.  (See ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 25–28 and Federal Register \nauthorities cited therein regarding Notices of Final Priorities establishing agency priorities used in \nselection of the Grant Recipients.)  Instead, Defendants urge that the Department, embarking on a \nnew presidential administration, is entitled to make “big-picture” priority changes free from the \nconstraints of GEPA and the APA, and was therefore free to terminate the Grant Recipients’ \nawards on the basis that the Department essentially changed its mind. \nPlaintiffs have made a clear showing that the Department’s termination of the Grant \nRecipients’ Grant Program awards violates the APA.  Specifically, Plaintiffs make a clear showing \nAPPENDIX Page 94\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 38 of 48\nthat the Department did not change, modify, or alter the agency priorities (which are regulatory in \nnature and effect) on which the Department based the Grant Recipients’ Grant Awards.  Plaintiffs \nalso make a clear showing that the Department did not notify Grant Recipients that their programs \nwere inconsistent with, or violated, agency policies, as required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, and which \nthe Department cites in the Termination Letter.  (See, e.g., MACTE Decl., ECF No. 25-2, attesting \nthat prior to the Termination Letter, no MACTE Grant Recipient had received “notice, written or \notherwise, that the grant administered by [the Grant Recipient] engaged in any of the activities \ndescribed in the termination letter.”)  Defendants do not assert that, prior to issuance of the \nTermination Letters, any Grant Recipient was notified of such policy violation or non-compliance \n(despite the Termination Letter’s citation to C.F.R. § 200.341 as supportive authority for its \naction).   \nFor these reasons, the court concludes that Plaintiffs have made a clear showing of \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their APA claim.  Specifically, the court finds that the \nDepartment’s Termination Letter, and the Department’s termination of the Grant Recipients’ Grant \nAwards are likely to be proven arbitrary and capricious, because the Department’s action was \nunreasonable,  not  reasonably  explained,  based  on  factors  Congress  had  not  intended  the \nDepartment to consider (i.e., not agency priorities), and otherwise not in accordance with law.16  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019); FCC v. \nPrometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021); Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of the \nInterior, 899 F.3d 260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018).  \n \n \n16 The record before the court also supports a finding of likelihood of success on the basis that the Department’s action \nwas “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nAPPENDIX Page 95\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 39 of 48\nii.  Termination Letter Grounds \nEven  crediting  Defendants’  assertions  that  the  “agency  priorities”  referenced  in  the \nTermination Letters are not subject to notice and comment rule making, and that the Department \nfollowed procedure required by law in issuing the Termination Letters, Plaintiffs still make a clear \nshowing of likelihood of success on their APA claim because the Termination Letters fail to \nprovide Grant Recipients any workable, sensible, or meaningful reason or basis for the termination \nof their awards.  Plaintiffs correctly observe: “the form letters failed to provide basic notice by \nomitting  any  specificity  about  the  reason  that  the  Department  found  any  individual  grant \n‘inconsistent with . . . Department priorities.’ The letters merely list, disjunctively, five vague ways \nin which the specific grants at issue might be ‘inconsistent.’”17  (ECF No. 5-1 n.10.)  The court \nagrees.   \nThe Department has not provided the “reasonable explanation” of its final agency action \nthe APA requires.  Prometheus, 592 U.S. at 423.  The Termination Letter’s list of ways in which \na Grant Recipient’s program is “inconsistent” with Department priorities is so broad and vague as \nto be limitless; devoid of import, even.  Coupled with the disjunctive nature of the list (“. . . or that \notherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States”), the Termination Letter effectively \nand practically renders meaningless the right to appeal, which, as described in the Termination \nLetter, requires a written appeal to be submitted within 30 days containing a “brief statement of \nyour argument and the disputed factual, legal, or other issues.”  (ECF No. 1-2.)  Inasmuch as the \nTermination Letter at once accuses a Grant Recipient of nothing and everything, it is utterly unclear \n17 The Termination Letters provide in pertinent part: “The grant specified above provides funding for programs that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal \ncivil rights law; that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; \nthat are not free from fraud, abuse, or duplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States.”  \n(ECF No. 1-2.) \nAPPENDIX Page 96\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 40 of 48\nto the court how a terminated Grant Recipient might mount such an appeal.  How does one draft a \n“brief statement” of a “disputed” fact when one has no earthly idea what has been asserted, if \nanything? \nA reasonable explanation considers relevant data and articulates a satisfactory explanation \nfor the agency’s decision, “including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.”  Dep’t of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  The \nDepartment has not provided a satisfactory explanation of the facts found or the choice made, \nmuch less a rational connection between the two.  The Termination Letter fails to mention or refer \nto data or information the Department considered, if any, in deciding that the Grant Programs no \nlonger effectuate Department priorities.  Further, the Department’s use of a template or boilerplate \nletter issued to all Grant Recipients further strengthens Plaintiffs’ argument that the Department \ndid not consider individual, or any, data or information.  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., — F. \nSupp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825, at *3 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025) (finding \nthe same Termination Letter “does not reach the level of a reasoned explanation; indeed it amounts \nto no explanation at all”). \niii. Oglesby California Case Declaration   \n  On the eve of the hearing, Defendants, with Plaintiffs’ consent, offered for the court’s \nconsideration a declaration of Rachel Oglesby, Chief of Staff of the Department, which bears the \ncaption of, and was offered in, the California case.  (Hearing Ex. No. 2.)  In the declaration, Ms. \nOglesby attests to the Department’s “individualized review process” of “every grant issued under \nthe [TQP] Program and the [SEED] Program.”  Id. ¶¶ 6, 7.  At the hearing here, Defendants did \nnot rely on Ms. Oglesby’s declaration to oppose Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious argument.  \nNonetheless, inasmuch as the declaration is before the court, the court addresses its significance.    \nAPPENDIX Page 97\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 41 of 48\n  In reviewing a final agency action, the court “‘consider[s] the record made before the \nagency at the time the agency acted,’ so ‘post-hoc rationalizations . . . have traditionally been found \nto be an inadequate basis for review.’”  Roe v. Dep’t of Defense, 947 F.3d 207, 220 (4th Cir. 2020) \n(quoting Dow AgroSciences LLC v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 707 F.3d 462, 467–68 (4th Cir. \n2013)).  Courts may consider “affidavits not contained in the agency record . . . where ‘there was \nsuch failure to explain administrative action as to frustrate effective judicial review.’” Dow \nAgroSciences, 707 F.3d at 468 (quoting Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142–43 (1973)).  Such post-\nhoc materials, however, must only provide “background information or evidence of whether all \nrelevant factors were examined by an agency,” or be “merely explanatory of the original record \nand . . . contain no new rationalizations.” AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 810 F.2d \n1233, 1236 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).  \nEven if credited as “background information” or “merely explanatory of the original \nrecord,” Ms. Oglesby’s declaration, regarding plaintiffs in another case, fails to rescue Defendants \nfrom the unavoidable conclusion that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA \nclaim.    Ms.  Oglesby’s  declaration  fails  to  remedy  that  the  Termination  Letter  evinces  no \nindividualized consideration of Grant Recipient awards and does not shed light on which of the \npossible grounds for termination set forth in the disjunctive list applies to a Termination Letter \nrecipient.  Further, nothing in Ms. Oglesby’s declaration suggests that any of the unnamed grants \nMs. Oglesby describes are at issue in this action.  See Hearing Ex. No. 2 ¶¶ 11–16 (offering reasons \nwhy five unnamed grants were terminated); id. ¶ 24 (“The [Termination] letters reasoned that the \nfunded programs ‘promote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully \ndiscriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; . . . violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict with \nAPPENDIX Page 98\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 42 of 48\nthe Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; . . . are not free \nfrom fraud, abuse, or duplication; or … otherwise fail to serve the best interest of the United \nStates.” (ellipses in original)). \n2.

For purposes of the Motion, Defendants do \nnot dispute Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.  (ECF No. 24 at \np. 27.)   \nPlaintiffs have made a clear showing that their members will suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of an injunction.  According to the supporting declarations, the loss of funding will cause \nsome Grant Recipients to shutter their programs entirely.  (NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 14; AU \nDecl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13.)  Others will be forced to terminate staff that work on teacher preparation \nprograms and will be unable to provide funding to teachers set to start in their respective training \nprograms—teachers who often rely on such funding for their livelihoods.  (NCTR Decl., ECF No. \n5-4 ¶¶ 14–15; AU Decl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., ECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 13–14; Alder GSE Decl., \nECF No. 5-8 ¶ 13; Teaching Lab Decl., ECF No. 5-9 ¶ 19.)  Plaintiffs ably demonstrate that they \nwill suffer irreparable harm that is both actual and imminent absent a preliminary injunction—\nharm that will affect the existence of Grant Recipients’ programs as well as the livelihoods of \nindividuals within the affected teacher preparation programs.   \n \n \n18  As to Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the impact on their missions, the Fourth Circuit has indicated that where an \norganizational plaintiff’s standing is based on a representation theory (as is the case with respect to AACTE and \nMACTE, but not as to NCTR), district courts should look at the irreparable harm to its members.  N. Carolina State \nConf. of the NAACP v. Raymond, 981 F.3d 295, 311 n.9 (4th Cir. 2020).   \n \nPlaintiffs also assert irreparable harm in the form of a likely constitutional violation, see ECF No. 5-1 at p. 24; this \nargument is unavailing in view of the court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs have not made a clear showing that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their Fifth Amendment claim.   \nAPPENDIX Page 100\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 44 of 48\n3.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest  \nFinally, “Plaintiffs must show ‘that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor’ and ‘that \nan injunction is in the public interest.’”  Pierce v. N. Carolina State Bd. of Elections, 97 F.4th 194, \n225 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  When, \nas here, the Government is the party opposing a motion for preliminary injunction, the balance of \nequities and public interest factors merge.  Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 365 (4th Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  Courts “must balance the competing claims \nof injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested \nrelief,” with “particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy \nof injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, AK, 480 U.S. \n531, 542 (1987)); see Ass’n of Am. Publishers, Inc. v. Frosh, 586 F. Supp. 3d 379, 397 (D. Md. \n2022) (same).  The court considers “the ‘harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is erroneously denied \nversus harm to the defendant if the injunction is erroneously granted.’”  Students for Fair \nAdmissions v. United States Naval Acad., 707 F. Supp. 3d 486, 509 (D. Md. 2023) (quoting \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Adams, 937 F.3d 973, 980 (7th Cir. 2019)).   \nPlaintiffs argue that the balance of equities favors them – where a preliminary injunction \nwould restore “the status quo . . . had the Department not unlawfully terminated” the Grant \nAwards.  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 30.)  Absent an injunction, Plaintiffs assert, the Grant Recipients’ \nteaching preparation programs risk closure.  Id. at pp. 30–31.  Defendants, in turn, argue that \n“several compelling interests” weigh against an injunction, referring to the Government’s and \nsome citizens’ interest in “ending discrimination” in the form of DEI policies, a cornerstone of \nPresident Trump’s reelection.  (ECF No. 24 at pp. 27–29.)   \nAPPENDIX Page 101\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 45 of 48\nDefendants’ arguments miss the mark insofar as the Winter factors are concerned.  The \ninquiry the court is obliged to undertake requires the balancing of harm if the injunction is \nerroneously granted as opposed to denied.  See Students for Fair Admissions, 707 F. Supp. 3d at \n509, supra.  In that vein, a member of the public who is opposed to government funding of Grant \nPrograms that relate to DEI does not outweigh the asserted concrete, irreparable harm in the form \nof programmatic closures, staff terminations, and loss of funding of teacher preparation programs \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members will experience should the injunction not issue.19  The harms \nPlaintiffs identify also implicate grave effect on the public: fewer teachers for students in high-\nneed neighborhoods, early childhood education, and special education programs.  (AU Decl., ECF \nNo. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., ECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 6, 14–15.)  Moreover, even to the extent Defendants \nassert such an interest in ending DEI-based programs, they have sought to effect change by means \nthe court finds likely violate the law.  “[T]he public ‘undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its \ngovernmental institutions follow the law.’”  Vitkus v. Blinken, 79 F.4th 352, 368 (4th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 230–31).   \nThe balance of equities and public interest favor issuance of a preliminary injunction.   \nD.  Appropriate Scope of the Preliminary Injunction  \nHaving determined that Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction, the court turns \nnow to the proper scope of the injunction.20  “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of \n19 At the hearing, Defendants asserted that individual participants in these teacher preparation programs may be \nharmed by “believing their success . . . [to be] unearned.” See ECF No. 24 at p. 28 (quoting Students for Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 275–76 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring)).  \nInasmuch as individuals are free to participate in such programs, or not, this is unpersuasive with respect to the Motion.  \n20 Defendants request that, if the court is inclined to grant a preliminary injunction, it should instead remand the matter \nto the Department, so that it may provide a more detailed explanation for the terminations on an expedited schedule.  \n(ECF No. 24 at p. 29.)  In the time since Defendants’ filing, there have been significant reductions in force at the \nDepartment, which defense counsel acknowledged at the hearing consistent with her duties of candor to the court.  In \naccordance with her duties as an officer of the court, defense counsel expressed that she did not know whether \nexpedited review remained possible.  Regardless, Defendants’ request for remand is not compelling here, where they \nAPPENDIX Page 102\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 46 of 48\ndiscretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance \nof the legal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579 \n(2017).  Federal district courts possess “wide discretion to fashion appropriate injunctive relief in \na particular case.”  Roe v. Dep’t of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 231 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Jan. 14, \n2020) (quoting Richmond Tenants Org., Inc. v. Kemp, 956 F.2d 1300, 1308 (4th Cir. 1992)).  At \nthe same time, courts also “must ensure that ‘a preliminary injunction is no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.’”  HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, \n985 F.3d 309, 326 (4th Cir. 2021) (quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 231).  The court “may issue a \nnationwide injunction so long as [it] ‘mold[s] its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular \ncase.’”  Id. (quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 231).  “[A] nationwide injunction may be appropriate when \nthe government relies on a ‘categorical policy,’ and when the facts would not require different \nrelief for others similarly situated to the plaintiffs.”  Id. (quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 232–33).   \n   With the aforementioned principles in mind, the court concludes the following scope is no \nmore burdensome than necessary to provide complete relief to Plaintiffs and those similarly \nsituated,  and  subject  to  the  Termination  Letter,  or  substantially  the  same  Grant  Program \ntermination letters, pursuant to the Department’s apparent categorical policy.  See HIAS, 985 F.3d \nat 326, supra.  By separate order, issued herewith, Defendants are ordered to reinstate the Grant \nAwards for Plaintiffs’ members who are Grant Recipients (including NCTR), in accordance with \nthe GAN Terms and Conditions in place immediately prior to the Termination Letters.  The court \nwill further order that Defendants shall not undertake to terminate, or terminate, any TQP, SEED, \nand TSL awards in a manner this court has determined is likely unlawful as violative of the APA \nas described herein.       \nfail to state or to propose a time frame within which Plaintiffs’ members complaints addressed herein could be \nevaluated.   \nAPPENDIX Page 103\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 47 of 48\nE.  Security \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), this court “may issue a preliminary \ninjunction . . . only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay \nthe costs  and damages  sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c).  “This rule is mandatory and unambiguous.”  Hoechst Diafoil \nCo. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 421 (4th Cir. 1999) (citing District 17, UMWA v. A & \nM Trucking, Inc., 991 F.2d 108, 110 (4th Cir. 1993)).   \nIn determining the amount of an injunction bond, courts “should be guided by the purpose \nunderlying Rule 65(c), which is to provide a mechanism for reimbursing an enjoined party for \nharm it suffers as a result of an improvidently issued injunction or restraining order”; the inquiry \nthus “ordinarily depends on the gravity of the potential harm to the enjoined party.”  Hoechst \nDiafoil, 174 F.3d at 421 n.3.  While bond is mandatory, the court has discretion “to set the bond \namount ‘in such sum as the court deems proper,’” including a bond in a nominal amount or in the \namount of zero.  See id. at 421 n.3 (citations omitted) (discussing a nominal bond); Maryland Dep’t \nof Hum. Res. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 976 F.2d 1462, 1483 n.23 (4th Cir. 1992) (discussing a \nnominal bond amount of zero).  Indeed, a nominal bond approach “has long been followed in \npublic-interest litigation cases.”  State of Maryland, et al., v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, et al., — \nF. Supp. 3d — , No. CV JKB-25-0748, 2025 WL 800216, at *26 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025) (citing \ncases).    \nPlaintiffs here request that no bond, or alternatively a nominal bond, be required.  (ECF \nNo. 5-1 at p. 31.)  At the hearing on the Motion, defense counsel stated that Defendants did not \noppose Plaintiffs’ request for no bond.  Defendants subsequently filed a notice advising of their \nchange of position and requesting bond amount “equal to the Federal Government’s potential costs \nAPPENDIX Page 104\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 48 of 48\nand damages from a wrongly issued injunction,” per President Trump’s March 11, 2025 Executive \nOrder titled “Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).”  (ECF Nos. 30, \n30-1.)  Defendants now seek a bond, because injunctive relief “would potentially mandate that the \nExecutive spend money that may not be recouped once distributed.”  (ECF No. 30.)  Defendants \ndo not request a specific amount in bond; and this and other courts have imposed a nominal bond \nupon such unsupported speculations.  See, e.g., PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, 2025 \nWL 685124, at *32 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025); Washington v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-00244-LK, 2025 \nWL 659057, at *28 n.29 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025).  Cf. Hoechst Diafoil Co., 174 F.3d at 421 \nn.3 (explaining that where the risk of harm to an enjoined party is “remote,” “a nominal bond may \nsuffice”).    \nIn view of the facts here, and where Defendants present no non-speculative assertion of \npotential costs and damages, the court finds a nominal bond is appropriate.  As far as the court can \ndiscern, and Defendants do not argue to the contrary, any financial cost Defendants may incur \nexisted prior to terminations of Grant Program awards at issue here.  The court will, therefore, set \na nominal bond in the amount of $100.00.   \nIV.

Trump’s, in his official \ncapacity as President of the United States, Emergency Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 36; \nthe “Motion.”)  The court has reviewed all papers.  No hearing is necessary and none has been \nrequested.  Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023).    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs discussed at length in its memorandum opinion issued Monday, March 17, 2025, \nPlaintiffs AACTE, NCTR, and MACTE initiated this action on March 5, 2025, asserting two \nclaims: violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Count I) and violation of the \nAPA (Count II).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the Department’s termination of grants \nawarded through the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Programs.  Following briefing and a hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.  (ECF Nos. 32, 33.)  Specifically, the court held that Plaintiffs demonstrated a clear \n1 All terms defined in the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. 32 shall have the same meanings here.   \nAPPENDIX Page 108\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 2 of 13\nlikelihood of success on the APA claim and issued a preliminary injunction that, inter alia, requires \nDefendants to reinstate TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards of Plaintiff NCTR and Plaintiffs’ \nmembers, and enjoins Defendants from terminating TQP, SEED, or TSL awards in a manner the \ncourt  found  likely  in  violation  of  the  APA.    Id.    Defendants  are  required  to  reinstate  the \naforementioned TQP, SEED, and TSL awards within five business days of the court’s order.  (ECF \nNo. 33.)   \n  At 7:53 p.m. on March 18, 2025, Defendants filed their emergency Motion, requesting the \ncourt rule on the Motion within 24 hours.  (ECF No. 36.)  That same evening, the court ordered \nPlaintiff to respond by 12:00 p.m. today, March 19, 2025.  (ECF No. 37.)  Plaintiffs met that \ndeadline with 8 minutes to spare (ECF No. 38), following which Defendants filed a reply at 2:11 \np.m. today (ECF No. 40).  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) \nDefendants bring this Motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).  (ECF \nNo. 26-1 at p. 2.)  Rule 54(b) “governs reconsideration of orders that do not constitute final \njudgments in a case (i.e., interlocutory orders).”  Carrero v. Farrelly, 310 F. Supp. 3d 581, 583–\n84 (D. Md. 2018).  Rule 54(b) provides that “any order or other decision . . . that adjudicates fewer \nthan all the claims . . . may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all \nthe claims.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 54(b).  “Compared to motions to reconsider final judgments pursuant \nto Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 54(b)’s approach involves broader \nflexibility to revise interlocutory orders before final judgment as the litigation develops and new \nfacts or arguments come to light.”  U.S. Tobacco Coop. Inc. v. Big S. Wholesale of Virginia, LLC, \n899 F.3d 236, 257 (4th Cir. 2018) (emphasis in original) (citing Carlson v. Boston Sci. Corp., 856 \nAPPENDIX Page 109\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 3 of 13\nF.3d 320, 325 (4th Cir. 2017)).  Resolution of a motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory \norder “is committed to the discretion of the district court.”  Am. Canoe Ass’n v. Murphy Farms, \nInc., 326 F.3d 505, 515 (4th Cir. 2003).  Importantly, “the discretion afforded by Rule 54(b) is not \nlimitless;” the Fourth Circuit has “cabined revision pursuant to Rule 54(b) by treating interlocutory \nrulings as law of the case.”  U.S. Tobacco Coop. Inc., 899 F.3d at 256–57.  Accordingly, a court \nmay revise an interlocutory order to account for “(1) a subsequent trial producing substantially \ndifferent evidence; (2) a change in applicable law; or (3) clear error causing manifest injustice.” \nId. at 257 (quoting Carlson, 856 F.3d at 325).    \nB.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)2 \n“Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.”  Barnett v. United States, 193 F. Supp. 3d 515, 518 (D. Md. 2016).  \n“The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of \nthe evidence.”  United States ex rel. Fadlalla v. DynCorp Int’l LLC, 402 F. Supp. 3d 162, 176 (D. \nMd. 2019) (citing Lovern v. Edwards, 190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 1999)).  “In determining whether \njurisdiction exists, ‘the court may look beyond the pleadings and the jurisdictional allegations of \nthe complaint and view whatever evidence has been submitted on the issue.’”  Id. at 176 (quoting \nKhoury v. Meserve, 268 F. Supp. 2d 600, 606 (D. Md. 2003)).  \nSubject matter jurisdiction challenges may proceed in two ways: “either a facial challenge, \nasserting that the allegations pleaded in the complaint are insufficient to establish subject matter \njurisdiction, or a factual challenge, asserting ‘that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint \n[are] not true.’” Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Trump, 416 F. Supp. 3d 452, 479 (D. Md. \n2019) (quoting Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009)).  Defendants here mount \n2 Defendants at once title their Motion as one “for Reconsideration” per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and \nseek dismissal of the Complaint per Rule 12(b)(1).   \nAPPENDIX Page 110\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 4 of 13\na facial challenge to this court’s exercise of jurisdiction.  In a facial challenge, “the facts alleged \nin the complaint are taken as true, and the motion must be denied if the complaint alleges sufficient \nfacts to invoke subject matter jurisdiction.”  Kerns, 585 F.3d at 192; see Ministry of Defence of \nState of Kuwait v. Naffa, 105 F.4th 154, 159 (4th Cir. 2024) (same). \nInasmuch as subject matter jurisdiction is unwaivable and may be raised at any time by any \nparty, including by the court sua sponte, the court dispenses with discussion of Rule 54 and moves \nto the heart of the matter.   \nIII.  ANALYSIS  \nDefendants now advance two arguments, both jurisdictional in nature, and neither of which \nwas raised in their briefing or oral argument on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.   \nFirst, Defendants argue the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the United States \nCourt of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over this action in accordance with the Tucker \nAct.  Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Department’s final agency \naction—termination of the Grant Program Awards by the Termination Letter—was a matter \ncommitted to agency discretion and, as such, is beyond the grasp of judicial review.   \nA.  Tucker Act – 28 U.S.C. § 1491 \n“The Tucker Act grants jurisdiction to the United States Court of Federal Claims ‘to render \njudgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any \nAct of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, . . . or for liquidated or unliquidated \ndamages in cases not sounding in tort.’”  Randall v. United States, 95 F.3d 339, 346 (4th Cir. 1996) \n(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491).  “Jurisdiction is exclusive in the Court of Federal Claims for claims \nover $10,000, while district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Federal Claims \nAPPENDIX Page 111\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 5 of 13\nfor claims at or under $10,000.”  Coleman v. Kendall, 74 F.4th 610, 615 (4th Cir. 2023), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 818 (2024) (citing Randall, 95 F.3d at 347).  \nWhile not novel, Massachusetts v. Nat’l Institutes of Health, 25-cv-10338, 2025 WL \n702163, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), “[t]he interplay between the Tucker Act and the APA is \nsomewhat complicated and raises some significant issues of federal court jurisdiction.”  Randall, \n95 F.3d at 346.  “The APA allows private parties to sue the federal government in district court \nover final agency actions, so long as they seek relief other than monetary damages ‘for which there \nis no other adequate remedy in a court.’”  Coleman, 74 F.4th at 615 (quoting Randall, 95 F.3d at \n346).  “Claims for money, by contrast, proceed under the Tucker Act and in the Court of Federal \nClaims.”  Williams v. Roth, No. 8:21-CV-02135-PX, 2022 WL 4134316, at *5 (D. Md. Sept. 12, \n2022) (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(a)(2), 1491).   To that end, “where ‘a plaintiff has an adequate \nremedy by suit under the Tucker Act,’ they are precluded from review under the APA.”  Coleman, \n74 F.4th at 615 (quoting Randall, 95 F.3d at 346); see also Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United \nStates, 590 U.S. 296, 324 (2020) (noting the flip side of the same coin: “[t]he Tucker Act yields \nwhen the . . . Administrative Procedure Act [] provides an avenue for relief”).  \n“There is a ‘distinction between an action at law for damages,’ which provides monetary \ncompensation, and ‘an equitable action for specific relief,’ which might nonetheless require \nmonetary  relief.”    Massachusetts,  2025  WL  702163,  at  *7  (first  quoting  Bowen  v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988); and then citing Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. \nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204, 213 (2002) (explaining “whether [restitution] is legal or equitable depends \n‘on the basis for [the plaintiff’s] claim’ and the nature of the underlying remedies sought” (citations \nomitted)).  “To determine whether a plaintiff seeks primarily injunctive relief such that a district \ncourt has jurisdiction over his claim, courts must look to the ‘essence’ of the complaint and whether \nAPPENDIX Page 112\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 6 of 13\nthe relief requested is ‘not . . . an incident of, or collateral to, a monetary award.’”  Coleman, 74 \nF.4th at 615–16 (quoting Randall, 95 F.3d at 346).   \n“The classification of a particular action as one which is or is not ‘at its essence’ a contract \naction depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon \nthe type of relief sought (or appropriate).”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1982).  “Courts must read the Complaint with an eye toward ‘the true nature of the action’ to \nascertain whether it is, in fact, seeking money damages or some other relief.”  Williams v. Roth, \nNo. 8:21-CV-02135-PX, 2022 WL 4134316, at *5 (D. Md. Sept. 12, 2022) (quoting James v. \nCaldera, 159 F.3d 573, 579 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).  Importantly, “a suit which does not seek monetary \ndamages does not arise under the Tucker Act simply because the plaintiff’s success will result in \neventual monetary gain from the government.”  Harrison v. Kendall, 670 F. Supp. 3d 280, 297 \n(E.D. Va. 2023) (quoting Powe v. Sec’y of Navy, 35 F.3d 556, at *2 (4th Cir. 1994) (unpublished \ntable decision)); see Roetenberg v. Sec’y of Air Force, 73 F. Supp. 2d 631, 636 (E.D. Va. 1999) \n(explaining that “[i]t is settled that where . . . the essence of a claim is the equitable relief sought, \nand any financial ramifications of a favorable decision are subordinate to the equitable relief, the \nCourt of Federal Claims does not have exclusive jurisdiction over that claim” (emphasis in \noriginal)). “The fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a \nsufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893.   \n“A hallmark of such equitable actions is the existence of prospective relief in ongoing \nrelationships.”  Massachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, at *7 (citing Bowen, 487 U.S. at 905).  “An \nadjudication of the lawfulness of [an agency’s] regulatory interpretation will have future impact \non the ongoing relationship between the parties.  The Court of Federal Claims cannot provide this \nrelief.”  Katz v. Cisneros, 16 F.3d 1204, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  In contrast, a suit properly proceeds \nAPPENDIX Page 113\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 7 of 13\nin the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act where plaintiffs “seek not prospective, \nnonmonetary relief to clarify future obligations but specific sums already calculated, past due, and \ndesigned to compensate for completed labors.”  Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 \nU.S. 296, 298 (2020).  Indeed, it is generally understood that the Court of Federal Claims “has no \npower to grant equitable relief.”  Richardson v. Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465 (1973).  The Tucker \nAct, however, allows for narrow exception to empower the Court of Federal Claims to provide \ninjunctive relief only when such relief is necessary to provide an entire remedy and when the \ninjunction is “an incident of and collateral to” an award of monetary relief.  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2).  \nIn Bowen, the Supreme Court considered whether a district court had subject matter \njurisdiction over the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ request for judicial review of the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services’ Medicaid disallowance decision; and to order the Secretary to pay \nthe state the monies it asserted had been wrongfully disallowed (not reimbursed). Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. at 882.  The Court concluded: “since the orders are for specific relief \n(they undo the Secretary’s refusal to reimburse the State) rather than for money damages (they do \nnot provide relief that substitutes for that which ought to have been done) they are within the \nDistrict Court’s jurisdiction under § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity.”  Id. at 910.   \nBowen sets forth a thorough explication – relying with favor on Judge Bork’s analysis in \nMaryland Dept. of Health Resources v. Dept. of Health and Human Svc., 763 F.2d 1441 (D.C. Cir. \n1985) – of the critical distinction between “money damages” and “monetary relief.”  487 U.S. at \n894–96.  In sum, the Court explains that while money damages is always a form of monetary relief, \nnot all monetary relief is money damages.  And an action to enforce a statute (there, the Medicaid \nAct), “which happens to be one for the payment of money” does not render it subject to the Tucker \nAct.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 900.  “The fact that the mandate is one for the payment of money must \nAPPENDIX Page 114\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 8 of 13\nnot be confused with the question whether such payment, in these circumstances, is a payment of \nmoney as damages or as specific relief.”  Id. at 900-901. \nIn California v. U.S. Department of Education, Judge Joun concluded in favor of the \ndistrict court’s subject matter jurisdiction on a Tucker Act challenge.  He concluded that the \nplaintiffs (several states) “seek equitable relief in the form of reinstatement of the TQP and SEED \ngrants.  Plaintiff States also seek to enjoin Defendants from implementing, giving effect to, \nmaintaining or reinstating under a different name the termination of any previous awarded TQP \nand SEED grants. In other words, Plaintiff States seek to preserve the previous status quo to \nalleviate corresponding harm; they are not alleging claims for past pecuniary harms.”  California \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825,  at *1 (D. \nMass. Mar. 10, 2025) (citing Massachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, where Judge Angel Kelley found \nthe essence of the plaintiffs’ claims was not contractual in nature because “Plaintiffs do not bring \nclaims for past pecuniary harms.  Rather, like petitioners in Bowen, their claims are to preserve \ntheir ongoing and prospective agreements with [the agency]”)); see also Aids Vaccine Advoc. Coal. \nv. United States Dep’t of State, — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-00400 (AHA), 2025 WL 752378, \nat *9 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) (finding that “Plaintiffs do not seek money damages and, . . . do not \nseek the contractual remedy of ‘money in compensation for [their losses], whatever they may be,’ \nin relation to any breach of their agreements . . . .  Indeed, it would be quite extraordinary to \nconsider Plaintiffs’ claims to sound in breach of contract when they do not at all depend on whether \nthe terms of particular awards were breached—they instead challenge whether the agency action \nhere was unlawful, irrespective of any breach”).   \nOn review of the caselaw, controlling and persuasive alike, whether the Tucker Act \ncontrols (i.e., divests a district court of jurisdiction) is fact-specific and requires analysis tailored \nAPPENDIX Page 115\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 9 of 13\nto the particular facets of the claims before the court.  The court must consider: 1) the beating heart \nof the plaintiff’s complaint; and 2) what relief will render the plaintiff whole if the complaint has \nmerit. \nHere, the court concludes that the Tucker Act does not apply and this court has subject \nmatter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims for the following chief reasons:  \n1.  Plaintiffs do not seek money damages for past wrongs.  Plaintiffs come to court \nseeking redress for alleged statutory and regulatory violations that, if left unchecked, will have \nimmediate, lasting and irreparable harm of an existential nature to their programs, and resultant \ngrave harm to the communities they serve.  Plaintiffs’ seek reinstatement of their status as Grant \nProgram awardees so they can resume and sustain the capacity to run their education-related \nprogramming across the nation; that the court’s order for reinstatement effects the Department’s \npurse does not render this a contract claim for money damages.  That is not its essence; \n2.  In addition to reinstatement, Plaintiffs seek forward-looking equitable relief to \nprevent Defendants from terminating other Grant Program awards in the manner about which they \ncomplain and for which they requested preliminary injunctive relief.  The Court of Federal Claims \nlacks the authority to afford the complete equitable relief Plaintiffs seek; \n3.  The  narrow  circumstances  in  which  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  may  issue \ninjunctive relief per the Tucker Act do not exist here, which is to say, equitable relief is not incident \nof, or collateral to, an award of money damages. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2);  \n4.  In addition to restoration of their Grant Program status, Plaintiffs demand the court \norder Defendants to remove “route pay grant conditions” (requiring pre-approval to access grant \nfunds), which Plaintiffs allege Defendants unlawfully put in place.  Here, again, Plaintiffs seek \nAPPENDIX Page 116\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 10 of 13\nforward-looking equitable relief to remove what they allege are unlawful roadblocks to their \nprogramming.  The Court of Federal Claims lacks the authority to provide this relief; and  \n5.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint requires the court to review and make findings regarding the \nparties’  relationship  pursuant  to  a  constellation  of  sources:  the  Grant  Programs’  respective \nauthorizing statutes, the Departments regulations to implement those statutes; and GEPA.  This, \nalone, removes this action from the Tucker Act’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of \nFederal Claims.    \nThe cases Defendants cite in their reply are unavailing.  Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United \nStates, for example, involves a private government contractor who contracted to provide data \nprocessing services and equipment to the General Services Administration.  764 F.2d 891 (1985).  \nWhen the plaintiff failed to provide deliverables, GSA invoked the liquidated damages provision \nof the contract and withheld payment on outstanding invoices.  The contractor sued, claiming GSA \nviolated the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3701, et seq.); the district court dismissed the action \non the basis that (per the Tucker Act), it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Federal \nClaims had exclusive jurisdiction.  Id.  Nothing about that case resembles the instant action.   \nIn Thermalon Indus. v. United States, 34 Fed. Cl. 411 (1995), the plaintiff sued the United \nStates in the Court of Federal Claims for breach of contract claiming the government (the National \nScience Foundation) wrongfully withheld payment for work done under a research grant.  The \ngovernment  argued  the  district  court  had  exclusive  jurisdiction  because  the  grant  was  “an \nagreement intended to effectuate the sovereign obligations of the United States and that all such \nagreements necessarily fall outside the scope of . . .  the Tucker Act.”  Id. at 413.  The Court of \nFederal Claims rejected that argument because the authorizing statute (the National Science \nFoundation Act of 1950, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1861, et seq.) specifically empowered the National Science \nAPPENDIX Page 117\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 11 of 13\nFoundation to enter “contracts or other arrangements” to promote the sciences.   There, the plaintiff \nsought money damages for unpaid invoices for work completed per the grant contract.  Nothing \nabout that the court’s determination, as Defendants note in their reply, that a grant can fill the \nessential elements of a contract is remarkable; nor is the court’s ruling that Thermalon brought a \nstandard issue breach of contract action against the United States for non-payment of services.  \nAgain, as said above, Plaintiffs here do not seek an award of money damages for work performed \nor to compensate for a wrong.   \nB.  Judicial Review  \nDefendants also seek reconsideration of the court’s preliminary injunction on the basis that \nthe challenged agency action at issue here—termination of the Grant Awards on the basis of \nagency priorities—is “committed to agency discretion by law” and falls outside the scope of \npermissible judicial review under the APA.  (ECF No. 36-2 at p. 7.)  See 5 U.S.C. § 702(a)(2).   \nThe APA provides “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely \naffected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to \njudicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “That language sets up a ‘basic presumption of judicial \nreview’ of agency action.”  Holbrook v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 48 F.4th 282, 287 (4th Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Abbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967)).  The text carves out two exceptions \nto that “basic principle.”  Id.  First, where “statutes preclude judicial review” per § 701(a)(1); and \nsecond,  where  “agency  action  is  committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law”  per  §  701(a)(2).  \nHolbrook, 48 F.4th at 287. With regard to the second, “[a]gency action is committed to the \nagency’s discretion when no judicially manageable standards are available to assess how and when \nan agency should exercise its discretion such that a court would have ‘no law to apply.’”  Pharm. \nCoal. for Patient Access v. United States, 126 F.4th 947, 964 (4th Cir. 2025) (quoting Heckler v. \nAPPENDIX Page 118\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 12 of 13\nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830–31 (1985)).  Of import here, the APA’s prohibition of judicial review \nof actions committed to agency discretion by law, and a defect related thereto, “goes to subject \nmatter jurisdiction.”  Id. (citing Angelex Ltd. v. United States, 723 F.3d 500, 505–506 (4th Cir. \n2013)). \nDefendants’ argument relies exclusively on the Supreme Court’s opinion in Lincoln v. \nVigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993).  (ECF No. 36-1 at p. 7–8.)  Lincoln is materially distinguishable from \nthe facts here.  In Lincoln, the Court’s decision concerned the Indian Health Service’s decision to \nreallocate resources from the Indian Children’s Program to a “nationwide effort to assist” children \npreviously served by the Indian Children’s Program.  508 U.S. at 184.  The Court held that the \nIndian Health Service’s “decision to discontinue the Program was ‘committed to agency discretion \nby law’ and therefore not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2), and that the Service’s exercise of that discretion was not subject to the notice-\nand-comment rulemaking requirements imposed by § 553.”  Id.   \nRelevant here, the Indian Health Service, per the Snyder Act, 25 U.S.C. § 13, and the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1601, et seq., received an annual appropriation from \nCongress.  Neither the Snyder Act nor the Indian Health Care Improvement Act expressly \nreferenced the Indian Children’s Program or any other potential recipient/beneficiary other than \ngeneral reference to “Indian health.”  508 U.S. at 194.  By virtue of that omission, Congress, the \nCourt held, left it to the sound discretion of the Indian Health Service how to spend or use the \nappropriated funds.  Id. at 185.  The Indian Children’s Program, thus, had no continuing legal \nentitlement to same, and “[t]he allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is another \nadministrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.”  Id. at 192.   \nAPPENDIX Page 119\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 13 of 13\nImportantly, the Indian Health Service’s termination of the Indian Children’s Program was \nexempt from § 533 notice and comment rule making based on § 553(b)(A)’s exemption of “rules \nof agency rulemaking” from same.  Id. at 197.  Here, per the intersection of GEPA and the APA, \nassessed at length in the court’s memorandum opinion issued earlier this week, the Department’s \n“agency priorities” vis-à-vis the Grant Programs (and Plaintiffs’ members’ Grant Awards) are \nsquarely within the APA’s notice and comment rule making requirement and, therefore, are not \ncorrectly categorized as items within “agency discretion” not subject to judicial review.   \nOutside of Lincoln, Defendants offer no substantive argument or authority to support their \nassertion that the Department’s termination of the Grant Awards at issue here was “committed to \nagency discretion by law” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  The court will not \nundertake a prolix analysis where virtually none has been offered by movants, especially as \nDefendants request a ruling within 24 hours of their emergency Motion.  The court is satisfied \nbased upon the record before it that the APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” has been \nneither rebutted nor overcome.  See Holbrook, 48 F.4th at 287 and Abbott Lab’ys, 387 U.S. at 140. \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly, it is this 19th day of March 2025: \nORDERED that the Motion (ECF No. 36) shall be, and is hereby, DENIED.  \n \n                /S/ \n     \n              Julie R.

Trump’s, in his official \ncapacity as President of the United States, Motion to Stay and Suspend Injunction Pending Appeal.  \n(ECF No. 44; the “Motion.”)  The court has reviewed all papers.  No hearing is necessary.  Local \nRule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023).    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs discussed at length in its memorandum opinion issued March 17, 2025 (ECF No. 32), \nPlaintiffs AACTE, NCTR, and MACTE initiated this action on March 5, 2025, asserting two \nclaims: violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Count I) and violation of the \nAPA (Count II).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the Department’s termination of grants \nawarded through the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Programs.  Following briefing and a hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 5), the court \ngranted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion (construed, by agreement of the parties, as one \n1 All terms defined in the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. 32 shall have the same meanings here.   \nAPPENDIX Page 121\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 2 of 10\nfor preliminary injunction only).  (ECF Nos. 32, 33.)  Specifically, the court held that Plaintiffs \ndemonstrated a clear likelihood of success on their APA claim and issued a preliminary injunction \nthat, inter alia, requires Defendants to reinstate TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards of Plaintiff \nNCTR and Plaintiffs’ members, and enjoins Defendants from terminating TQP, SEED, or TSL \nawards in a manner the court found likely violative of the APA.  Id.  Defendants are required to \nreinstate the aforementioned TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards within five business days of the \ncourt’s order.  (ECF No. 33.)   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c), a preliminary injunction is not stayed \nfollowing a notice of appeal “[u]nless the court orders otherwise.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 62(c); see also \nFED. R. APP. 8(a)(1) (providing that “[a] party must ordinarily move first in the district court \nfor . . . an order suspending . . . an injunction while an appeal is pending”).  The Supreme Court \nhas set forth four factors to consider in determining whether to stay the order of preliminary \ninjunction pending Defendants’ appeal: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 \n(1987).2   \nThe first two factors are “the most critical.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  \nThe last two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Id. at 435.  Here, \n2 The Hilton factors are similar to the Winter factors a plaintiff bears on a motion for preliminary injunction.  See ECF \nNo. 32 at pp. 14–15; Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008) (“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \ninterest.”); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (observing that “[t]here is substantial overlap between” the \nfactors governing issuance of a stay pending appeal and “the factors governing preliminary injunctions.”). \nAPPENDIX Page 122\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 3 of 10\nbecause Defendants are the parties seeking a stay, they bear the burden to demonstrate the factors \nweigh in favor of a stay.  Dep’t of Educ. v. Louisiana, 603 U.S. 866, 868 (2024) (providing that \n“the burden is on the Government as applicant to show, among other things, a likelihood of success \n. . . and that the equities favor a stay”).   \nIII.  ANALYSIS  \nA.  Whether Defendants Make a Strong Showing They Are Likely to Succeed on Merits \nAs set forth at length in the memoranda opinions on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction and on Defendants’ Emergency Motion for Reconsideration (ECF Nos. 32 and 42), \nPlaintiffs ably met their burden to demonstrate a clear showing of likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their APA claim (Count II) in two primary ways:   \n \n. . . Plaintiffs have made a clear showing of likelihood of success on \nthe merits of their APA claim. Specifically, the court finds that the \nDepartment’s Termination Letter, and the Department’s termination \nof the Grant Recipients’ Grant Awards are likely to be proven \narbitrary  and  capricious,  because  the  Department’s  action  was \nunreasonable, not reasonably explained, based on factors Congress \nhad  not  intended  the  Department  to  consider  (i.e.,  not  agency \npriorities), and otherwise not in accordance with law. 16 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A); Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 \n(2019); FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 \n(2021); Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of the Interior, 899 F.3d \n260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018). \n \nand \n \n. . . Plaintiffs . . . make a clear showing of likelihood of success on \ntheir APA claim because the Termination Letters fail to provide \nGrant Recipients any workable, sensible, or meaningful reason or \nbasis for the termination of their awards. . . .  The Department has \nnot provided the “reasonable explanation” of its final agency action \nthe APA requires.  Prometheus, 592 U.S. at 423.  The Termination \nLetter’s  list  of  ways  in  which  a  Grant  Recipient’s  program  is \n“inconsistent” with Department priorities is so broad and vague as \nto be limitless; devoid of import, even.  Coupled with the disjunctive \nnature of the list (“. . . or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests \nAPPENDIX Page 123\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 4 of 10\nof  the  United  States”),  the  Termination  Letter  effectively  and \npractically  renders  meaningless  the  right  to  appeal,  which,  as \ndescribed in the Termination Letter, requires a written appeal to be \nsubmitted within 30 days containing a “brief statement of your \nargument and the disputed factual, legal, or other issues.”  (ECF No. \n1-2.) . . . .  A reasonable explanation considers relevant data and \narticulates  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the  agency’s  decision, \n“including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.”  Dep’t of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting State \nFarm,  463  U.S.  at  43).    The  Department  has  not  provided  a \nsatisfactory explanation of the facts found or the choice made, much \nless a rational connection between the two.  The Termination Letter \nfails to mention or refer to data or information the Department \nconsidered, if any, in deciding that the Grant Programs no longer \neffectuate Department priorities.  Further, the Department’s use of a \ntemplate or boilerplate letter issued to all Grant Recipients further \nstrengthens  Plaintiffs’  argument  that  the  Department  did  not \nconsider individual, or any, data or information.  California v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 \nWL 760825, at *3 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025) (finding the same \nTermination  Letter  “does  not  reach  the  level  of  a  reasoned \nexplanation; indeed it amounts to no explanation at all”). \n \n(ECF No. 32 at pp. 37–40.) \n  Defendants  continue  to  ignore  or  misapprehend  the  court’s  analysis  and  resultant \nconclusion that, by application of GEPA, with two exceptions not relevant here, the APA’s \nrulemaking carve-out for grant-related matters does not apply to the Department’s asserted agency \npriorities on which it based its termination of the Grant Awards through its Termination Letter.  \nThe court did not find, as Defendants say, that “all priorities are identical in the regulations just \nbecause they include the word ‘priorities.’”  (ECF No. 44 at p. 3.)  Defendants’ watered-down \nmisdescription of the court’s reasoned discussion and findings regarding the interplay between the \nGrant  Programs’  authorizing  statutes,  Department  regulations  (within  the  Code  of  Federal \nRegulations) to implement those statutes, GEPA, and the APA, does not serve its aim to persuade \nthe court that they are likely to succeed on appeal.   \nAPPENDIX Page 124\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 5 of 10\nIn the same vein, the court has never purported to cabin the Secretary’s entitlement or \nability to change her priorities regarding broader “policy objectives.”  (ECF No. 44 at p. 4.)  Where \nsuch broader “policy objective” priorities are used as the premise to terminate Grant Awards, the \ncourt is (as it is here) tasked with redressing such termination if it runs afoul (as the court concluded \nit likely does here) of governing statutes and regulations.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (2025) \n(“The Federal award may be terminated in . . . its entirety . . . to the extent authorized by law, if an \naward no longer effectuates the . . . agency priorities.”).  Nothing in the court’s order at ECF No. \n33 prohibits, impairs, or limits Defendants’ ability, right, or entitlement to terminate Plaintiffs’ \nmembers’ Grant Awards provided any such termination is not undertaken or effected in a manner \nthe court determined is likely a violation of the APA.  \n  In the Motion, Defendants assert the Grant Programs’ authorizing statutes confer on the \nSecretary “significant discretion to allocate funds across grant applicants to best advance the \npurposes  of  the  programs”  and  “[n]othing  about  those  statutory  discretions  constrains  the \nSecretary’s discretion to determine how best to allocate funding for each program among many \ndifferent potential grant recipients.”  (ECF No. 44 at pp. 5–6.)  Defendants’ argument that the \nGrant Programs’ authorizing statutes commit allocating Grant Awards to the Secretary’s discretion \nignores not only GEPA, but also the undisputed fact that the Department uses notice and comment \nrulemaking to set priorities for selecting Grant Recipients.  See, e.g. ECF No. 24 at p. 26.  \nDefendants seem to argue that the authorizing statutes confer different levels of discretion for \nawarding funds and for terminating them, the former subject to the APA and the latter exempt \nfrom same.  Defendants identify no authority to support this contradiction; and it does not pass \nmuster.  Further, as the court previously explained, Defendants’ reliance on Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 \nU.S. 182 (1993), is unpersuasive as Lincoln is materially distinguishable from this case.  \nAPPENDIX Page 125\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 6 of 10\nRegarding Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs’ Complaint is essentially a contract dispute, \nthe court incorporates its discussion of the non-application of the Tucker Act from its order of two \ndays ago.  (ECF No. 42 at pp. 4–11.)  It bears more than a passing mention that, at the hearing on \nthe preliminary injunction, Defendants’ counsel asserted her clients’ position as follows: “We \nbelieve this is a straightforward – I don’t know if anything is straightforward in this administration, \nbut it’s a straightforward APA case,” and “we have a final agency action, and now the question is \nwas that action arbitrary and capricious . . . .  It’s an APA case.”  (Preliminary Injunction Hearing \nTr. 58:23–25, 54:15–17.)  The court agreed then and agrees now.  The essence of Plaintiffs’ claim \nis the equitable relief sought; Plaintiffs ask this court to review the lawfulness of the Department’s \ntermination  decision,  a  decision  that  will  have  an  immediate  and  ongoing  impact  on  the \nrelationship between the parties, namely the Plaintiffs’ and their members’ Grant Award status.  \nSee ECF No. 42 at p. 6.   \nFurther,  the  court  was  wholly  unpersuaded  by  Defendants’  Emergency  Motion  for \nReconsideration (ECF No. 36) in which Defendants sought dismissal of the action on the basis of \ntwo arguments that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.  (ECF No. 42, \nMemorandum  Opinion  and  Order  on  Defendants’  Emergency  Motion  for  Reconsideration.)  \nNothing Defendants present in the instant Motion, or elsewhere, gives the court pause as to its \nproper subject matter jurisdiction over this action or as to the correctness of its determination on \nthe Motion for Preliminary Injunction, including the strength of Plaintiffs’ Winter factors showing.  \nIndeed, the court found that Plaintiffs plainly and without question met their burden on likelihood \nof success, as well as irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and public interest.  (ECF No. 32 \nat pp. 42–45.)  Therefore, Defendants do not meet their burden to persuade the court they are likely \nAPPENDIX Page 126\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 7 of 10\nto succeed on the merits of their appeal of the court’s order at ECF No. 33 granting preliminary \ninjunctive relief (or the court’s denial of Defendants’ Emergency Motion for Reconsideration).   \nB.  Whether Defendants Will Be Irreparably Injured Absent a Stay \nThe preliminary injunction requires the Department (and others subject to the order) \nessentially to do what the court finds the law otherwise (already) requires of it and to return the \nparties to their respective status immediately prior to the likely unlawful termination of the Grant \nAwards  by  the  Department’s  Termination  Letter.    The  injunction  requires  nothing  of  the \nDepartment (or any Defendant) that the Department had not already committed to do in accordance \nwith its own regulations.  \nDefendants’ purported concerns over the Executive Branch’s authority are not compelling; \nthey mistake the point.  Defendants, in essence, purport to tee up a separation of powers question.  \nBut, no.  In fact, none exists.  The court’s order does not impair Defendants’ exercise of lawful \nauthority; and to the extent the Department wishes to terminate the Grant Awards, it may do so by \nlawful means as delineated by GEPA, the APA, and the Grant Award GANs.3  The Executive \nBranch’s authority does not carry with it the right to bypass statutory obligations set by Congress.  \nFor all such reasons, the court discerns no irreparable injury to Defendants absent a stay pending \nappeal.  \n \n \n3 For the same reasons, this court’s order does not, as a matter of fact or law, impair the Department or the Secretary’s \ncompliance with President Trump’s newest Executive Order titled Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering \nParents, States, and Communities (available online at https://perma.cc/22QL-8HVT) (last accessed March 21, 2025).  \nPresident Trump’s Executive Order requires that any action undertaken in compliance with, or to give life to, its \nstated Purpose and Policy (Section 1) be done “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law,” and \n“[c]onsistent with the Department of Education’s authorities;” and the President mandates that “this order shall \nbe implemented consistent with applicable law.”  Nothing about, or within, the Executive Order (expressly or by \nimplication) conflicts with, directs, encourages, or supports non-compliance with the court’s order at ECF No. 33. \nAPPENDIX Page 127\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 8 of 10\nC.  Whether a Stay Will Substantially Injure Plaintiffs and Public Interest \nAs the court recognized above, these factors “merge when the Government is the opposing \nparty.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Entry of a stay will produce immediate, \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs in precisely the ways the court identified in its memorandum opinion \nat ECF No. 33, because, here, a stay is the functional equivalent of denial of preliminary injunctive \nrelief, which the court found is necessary to avoid certain doom for Grant Recipient programs, and \nresultant/related harms to their affiliated teachers and administrators, and the communities they \nserve.   \nUntil this point, Defendants expressly conceded (in their papers and at oral argument) that \nPlaintiffs would experience irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  They now \nappear to retract that concession, arguing that “there is little to no evidence in the record regarding \nhow many months it would take before Plaintiffs begin to feel the impact of the lack of funding.”  \n(ECF No. 44 at p. 7.)  Apart from their inappropriate effort to generate a dispute on this point for \nthe first time in their Motion to stay the court’s order, Defendants’ position ignores the numerous \nundisputed attestations Plaintiffs offered in support of their preliminary injunction motion that \ndetail the many concrete harms their members will experience from the loss of their Grant Award \nfunding.  See, e.g., NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 14–15; AU Decl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., \nECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 13–14; Alder GSE Decl., ECF No. 5-8 ¶ 13; Teaching Lab Decl., ECF No. 5-9 ¶ \n19.   \nMoreover, Defendants’ present assertion is undermined by their own subsequent assertion \n(also in the Motion) that Plaintiffs’ members use their Grant Award funding for “purposes like \nsalaries and living wage stipends,” and they “would likely begin withdrawing immediately upon \ngrant reinstatement.”  (ECF No. 44 at p. 7.)  Defendants’ concession on irreparable harm just days \nAPPENDIX Page 128\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 9 of 10\nago; followed by their current retraction of the concession; followed by, in the same breath, an \nassertion that undermines their retraction exposes the untenable nature of their argument.   \nFurther, as set forth at pages 44 and 45 of the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. 32: \nThe harms Plaintiffs identify also implicate grave effect on the \npublic: fewer teachers for students in high-need neighborhoods, \nearly childhood education, and special education programs. (AU \nDecl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., ECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 6, 14–15.) \nMoreover, even to the extent Defendants assert such an interest in \nending DEI-based programs, they have sought to effect change by \nmeans  the  court  finds  likely  violate  the  law.  “[T]he  public \n‘undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental institutions \nfollow the law.’” Vitkus v. Blinken, 79 F.4th 352, 368 (4th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 230–31). \n \nThe court reiterates that here.   \nFor the same reasons discussed at length in the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. \n32, Defendants’ arguments fail to persuade the court that the risk of substantial injury to Plaintiffs \nand the public interest favor a stay pending appeal. \nD.  Bond  \nDefendants also assert that the court’s imposition of a nominal bond was error.  (ECF No. \n44 at p. 8.)  As the court has previously addressed, at the hearing, defense counsel did not oppose \nPlaintiffs’ request that the court require no bond.  Then, Defendants retracted that concession too \n– by later filing a notice advising of their change of position and requesting bond in an amount \n“equal  to  the  Federal  Government’s  potential  costs  and  damages  from  a  wrongly  issued \ninjunction,”  per  President  Trump’s  March  11,  2025,  Executive  Order  titled  “Ensuring  the \nEnforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).”  (ECF Nos. 30, 30-1.)  The court examined \nthe issue as it is required to do, and determined that a nominal bond was warranted here based on \nthe cited authorities – authorities Defendants do not address in their Motion.  The court is not \npersuaded that the court’s issuance of a nominal bond was error, and Defendants offer no \nAPPENDIX Page 129\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 10 of 10\nsubstantive legal argument for the court to change its mind now.  This similarly does not favor \nentry of a stay pending appeal.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly, it is this 21st  day of March 2025: \nORDERED that the Motion (ECF No. 44) shall be, and is hereby, DENIED.  \n \n                /S/ \n     \n              Julie R.

Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00702-JRR \n   \nLINDA MCMAHON, \nAS SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ RULE 60(B) MOTION TO \nDISSOLVE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND REQUEST FOR INDICATIVE \nRULING UNDER RULE 62.1 \n \nThis motion seeks relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to dissolve the preliminary injunction \nentered by this Court on March 17, 2025 based on notions of judicial economy, the preservation \nof all parties’ resources, and recognition that no party will suffer prejudice by avoiding the time \nand expense of an unnecessary appeal. Thus, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) the Court should set aside \nits preliminary injunction.  \nBecause this action is currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit, Plaintiffs request an immediate indicative ruling under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1 that \nthis Court would grant Plaintiffs’ Rule 60(b) motion on remand. This will enable Plaintiffs to move \nfor limited remand by the Fourth Circuit restoring this Court’s full jurisdiction over the matter, \nthereby allowing the Court to rule on the merits of Plaintiffs’ request for relief under Rule 60(b).  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs initiated this action on March 3, 2025 by filing a Complaint and a Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction requiring the Government to reinstate Plaintiff NCTR and Plaintiffs’ \nmember organizations’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants that were terminated in February 2025 and \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 52-1     Filed 04/27/25     Page 2 of 7\nremoving the route pay grant conditions from the grants. (ECF Nos. 1, 5). On March 17, 2025, this \nCourt granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction in part, ordering the Department to \nreinstate the terminated TQP, SEED, and TSL grants that had been awarded to Plaintiff NCTR and \nPlaintiffs’ member organizations in accordance with the Grant Award Notification terms and \nconditions in place immediately prior to their termination, and enjoining the Government from \nterminating any TQP, SEED, or TSL grant program awards in a manner that the Court determined \nis  likely  unlawful  as  violative  of  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act.  (ECF  No.  33)  (the \n“Preliminary Injunction”).  \nThe Government subsequently took an interlocutory appeal of the Preliminary Injunction \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on March 21, 2025. (ECF No. 46). The Fourth \nCircuit set a briefing schedule, whereby the Government’s opening brief and the joint appendix \nare due on May 5, 2025, Plaintiffs’ response brief is due on June 2, 2025, and any reply brief is \ndue within twenty-one days of service of a response brief. AACTE et al. v. Linda McMahon et al., \nNo. 25-1281 (4th Cir.), Dkt. No. 3.1 \nThe Government moved this Court for a stay and suspension of the Preliminary Injunction \npending appeal, (ECF No. 44), which this Court denied on March 21, 2025. (ECF No. 45). \nImmediately following this Court’s denial of the stay motion, on March 25, 2025, the Government \nfiled a time sensitive motion for stay pending appeal in the Fourth Circuit, which Plaintiffs opposed \non April 1, 2025. (Dkt. Nos. 12. 19). The Government filed a reply in further support of its stay \nmotion on April 4, 2024. (Dkt. No. 26). \n  While this case progressed in the District Court, the Attorneys General of multiple states \npursued litigation of substantially overlapping issues of law under the Administrative Procedure \n \n1 Filings in the Fourth Circuit action correspond with the docket number (“Dkt. No.”) in that court. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 52-1     Filed 04/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nAct concerning the termination of grants under the same federal programs in California v. United \nStates Department of Education, Civ. No. 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, (D. Mass.). After the District of \nMassachusetts issued a temporary restraining order, the Government appealed to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. See California v. U.S. Department of Education, No. 25-1244 (1st \nCir.). Similar to the case at bar, before the First Circuit, the Government filed an emergency motion \nto stay the district court’s order. (No. 25-1244, Mot. to Hold Briefing Schedule in Abeyance (1st \nCir. Mar. 12, 2025)). The parties fully briefed the motion, and the First Circuit denied the \nGovernment’s request to stay. (No. 25-1244, Order (1st Cir. Mar. 21, 2025)).  \nOn March 26, 2025, the Government submitted to the Supreme Court an Application to \nVacate the Order issued by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and \nRequest for an Immediate Administrative Stay (the “Application”). See Department of Education \nv. California, No. 24A910 (U.S. Mar. 26, 2025).  \nOn April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the Government’s Application and stayed \nthe District of Massachusetts’ order granting preliminary relief. See Department of Education v. \nCalifornia, No. 24A910 (U.S. April 4, 2025). That same day, Defendants here filed a notice letter \nin the Fourth Circuit advising of the Supreme Court’s determination on the Application. (Dkt. No. \n27). Upon consideration of the Supreme Court’s order in Department of Education v. California, \nthe Fourth Circuit granted a stay of the Court’s Preliminary Injunction pending appeal on April \n10, 2025. (Dkt. No. 30). \nTherefore,  this  Court’s  Preliminary  Injunction  has  been  stayed  --  and  all  grants’ \nterminations and route pay status have been reinstated -- since April 10, 2025. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo obtain relief under Rule 60(b), Plaintiffs must show that their motion is timely, that they \nhave a meritorious claim or defense, and that the opposing party would not be unfairly prejudiced \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 52-1     Filed 04/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nby having the judgment set aside. See Nat’l Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. Gray, 1 F.3d 262, 264 (4th \nCir. 1993) (quoting Park Corp. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 812 F.2d 894, 896 (4th Cir. 1987)).2To \n \nobtain specific relief under Rule 60(b)(6), Plaintiffs must provide a “reason that justifies relief.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6); see also Bartch v. Barch, 721 F. Supp. 3d 380, 382–83 (D. Md. 2024) \n(commenting that Rule 60(b) is a “catchall provision” and applicable where “appropriate to \naccomplish justice”) (citations omitted). The Court’s analysis under Rule 60(b) is a “flexible” one \nand it “focuses on the particular facts of the case.” L.J. v. Wilbon, 633 F.3d 297, 305 (4th Cir. \n2011). \nWhile an appeal is pending, a district court retains jurisdiction to consider a motion for \nrelief under Rule 60(b). See Fobian v. Storage Tech. Corp., 164 F.3d 887, 891 (4th Cir. 1999) \n(“[W]hen a Rule 60(b) motion is filed while a judgment is on appeal, the district court has \njurisdiction to entertain the motion, and should do so promptly.”). The Fourth Circuit has instructed \nthat, upon a filing of a Rule 60(b) motion while an appeal is pending, the district court may deny \nthe motion, or may “issue an indicative ruling under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1 stating that a Rule 60(b) \nmotion raises a substantial issue or would be granted.” Fourth Circuit Appellate Procedure Guide \n(Dec. 2021) at 22-23; see also Am. Coll. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists v. United States Food \n& Drug Admin., 506 F. Supp. 3d 328, 338 (D. Md. 2020) (“While a preliminary injunction is on \nappeal, a district court ordinarily may not dissolve or modify it . . . Upon a motion seeking such \naction, however, a court may issue an indicative ruling stating ‘either that it would grant the motion \nif the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.’ Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 62.1(a).”).  \n \n2 “Even though a preliminary injunction is not a ‘final order,’ courts have applied Rule 60(b)[] to \ndissolve or modify preliminary injunctions.” Stone v. Trump, 400 F. Supp. 3d 317, 332 (D. Md. \n2019). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 52-1     Filed 04/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nARGUMENT \nThis Court should, pursuant to Rule 60(b), dissolve the Preliminary Injunction. Although \nPlaintiffs continue to believe that this Court’s Preliminary Injunction is well-reasoned and correct, \nsubsequent  developments  in  the  appellate  courts,  described  supra,  warrant  dissolving  the \nPreliminary Injunction so that this matter can proceed in the ordinary course. This course of action \nfacilitates  judicial  economy  and  the  preservation  of  both  Plaintiffs’  and  the  Government’s \nresources. Granting this motion will cause no prejudice to the Government. Given the procedural \nposture of the appeal, an indicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1(a) is appropriate. \nWhen presented with such a request, this Court considers whether “justice requires” relief \nfrom an interlocutory order. See Fayetteville Invs. v. Comm. Builders, Inc., 936 F.2d 1462, 1473 \n(4th Cir. 1991) (quoting 7 Moore’s Federal Practice, ¶ 60.20, p. 60-170); see also Thompson v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 404 F.3d 821, 825 (4th Cir. 2005) (“It has long been recognized \nthat courts are vested with the inherent power to modify injunctions they have issued.”); Movie \nSys., Inc. v. MAD Minneapolis Audio Distribs., a Div. of Smoliak & Sons, Inc., 717 F.2d 427, 430 \n(8th Cir. 1983) (permitting “any changes in [a preliminary] injunction that are equitable in light of \nsubsequent changes in the facts or the law, or for any other good reason”) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs believe that the Fourth Circuit would affirm this Court’s Preliminary Injunction \nupon full consideration of the merits. Nonetheless, proceeding with the appeal would waste judicial \nresources because, regardless of the outcome, the parties will return to this Court following \nresolution of the interlocutory appeal to litigate the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims. The question is \nonly whether that will happen now or months from now, after the Fourth Circuit decides the \ninterlocutory appeal. Without the availability of the preliminary relief Plaintiffs so desperately \nneeded in light of the Fourth Circuit’s order, Plaintiffs propose to cut to the chase for the benefit \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 52-1     Filed 04/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nof all involved: granting the instant motion would simply allow the parties to develop a more \nfulsome record in this Court before any subsequent appeal. \nMoving directly to further proceedings in this Court—in which any relief granted would \nitself be subject to review by the Fourth Circuit—would save judicial resources in both this Court \nand in the Fourth Circuit. The dissolution of the Preliminary Injunction now will save both \nPlaintiffs and the Government the unnecessary time and expense of briefing and arguing the \ninterlocutory appeal.3 \nThe  Government  cannot  plausibly  claim  prejudice  from  a  request  that  will  spare  it \nadditional proceedings in the Fourth Circuit.4 This is especially so where the request is to dissolve \nthe very Order from which the Government noted an appeal in the first instance. The relief \nPlaintiffs seek in this Court is essentially the same as the relief the Government seeks in the Fourth \nCircuit. For that reason alone, any argument that the Government would suffer prejudice is \nillogical. \nFor all the foregoing reasons, justice requires dissolution of the preliminary injunction. \nAccordingly, the Court should issue an indicative ruling that the Court would dissolve the \npreliminary injunction if permitted to do so on remand for this purpose. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue an indicative \nruling pursuant to Rule 62.1 that it would grant Plaintiffs’ Rule 60(b) motion.\n \n3 This is why Plaintiffs contemporaneously move to shorten the time for the Government’s \nresponse. A resolution of this issue in advance of briefing in the Fourth Circuit is beneficial to all \nparties. \n \n4 On April 22, counsel for Plaintiffs requested the Government’s position with regard to a request \nto dissolve the Preliminary Injunction. To date, the Government has not advised of its position. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 52-1     Filed 04/27/25     Page 7 of 7\n \nDated: April 27, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \n /s/ Joshua W.B.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims \nand that an injunction is both in the public interest and in the interest of the equities at play here. \nThe Government does not dispute that in the absence of an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer \nirreparable harm. ECF No. 24 (“Def. Br.”) at 13. The Government also does not dispute that the \ntermination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants constituted final agency action, or that the \nterminations, if undertaken today, would violate the NADOHE order. See generally Def. Br.  \nAs a result, the remaining live issues are: (1) whether Plaintiffs are properly before this \nCourt; (2) whether continued enforcement of terminations that would be unlawful if taken today \nis permissible because it preceded a court order; and (3) whether “agency Priorities” as used in \nSection 200.340(a)(4) provides for essentially limitless discretion in terminating grants, as the \nGovernment argues. As shown below, Plaintiffs have established both standing and venue in this \naction; the Department’s continued enforcement of the terminations violates the Fifth Amendment \nto the Constitution via the NADOHE order; and the Government’s interpretation of “agency \npriorities” is completely unsupported by the text and a common-sense read of the law at issue. The \nCourt  should  enter  a  preliminary  injunction  ordering  the  Department  to  vacate  the  grant \nterminations for Plaintiffs and their members on both Fifth Amendment and APA grounds.  \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Venue is Proper in The State of Maryland. \nPlaintiffs have invoked venue pursuant to § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1), ECF No. 1 at ¶ 11, and \nvenue is proper in this District under both provisions. Section 1391(e) establishes venue in this \ndistrict because Plaintiff MACTE resides in this District, a proposition the Government neither \nchallenges nor addresses in its brief. This is really the end of the inquiry, but since the Government \nchallenges venue under (b)(2) as well, Plaintiffs will address it as well. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 5 of 19\n \nWhere, as here, a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States acting in her \nofficial capacity (Defendant McMahon), or an agency of the United States (Defendant Department \nof Education), the action may be brought in a judicial district where “the plaintiff resides if no real \nproperty is involved in the action.” 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C). Federal courts applying this venue \nprovision have concluded that only a single plaintiff need reside in the district to establish venue. \nSee A.J. Taft Coal Co. v. Barnhart, 291 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1301 (N.D. Ala. 2003) (collecting cases \nand remarking that “[f]or over thirty years federal courts have conclusively and consistently held \nthat the statutory language in 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(3)[1] regarding the residency of ‘the plaintiff’ \nshould be interpreted to mean any plaintiff rather than all plaintiffs.”) (emphasis in original); see \nalso id. at 1302 (“This court concludes that under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(3), a suit can be brought in \nany district in which a single plaintiff resides.”); Sidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d \n336, 345-46 (6th Cir. 2005) (“[T]he case law and legislative history compel this Court to hold that \nthe residency requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(3) is satisfied if at least one plaintiff resides in \nthe district in which the action has been brought.”). This action names as defendants an executive \nbranch official sued in her official capacity and an agency of the United States. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 15-\n16. MACTE is a resident of Maryland with its principal place of business located at 304 Hawkins \nHall, Towson University, Towson, Maryland 21252. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 14. Venue is, therefore, plainly \nproper pursuant to § 1391(e)(1)(C). \nAnd as noted, although Plaintiffs need not satisfy two different bases for venue, they do. \nVenue is also proper in this District because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim \noccurred in Maryland. As a threshold matter, MACTE is a member organization—not a “Maryland \n \n1 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) was restyled in 2011 to remove the numeric list—e.g., (1), (2), (3)—and insert the \nletters (A), (B), and (C). \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 6 of 19\n \nchapter” of a national organization. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 14 (describing MACTE as “membership \norganization”  that  includes  “regionally  accredited  colleges  and  universities  engaged  in  the \npreparation of professional school personnel with state program approval”); ECF No. 24 at 15. \nMore specifically, three of MACTE’s member organizations—Towson University, the \nUniversity of Maryland, and Frostburg State University—suffered termination of SEED and/or \nTQP grants. Supplemental Declaration of Laurie Mullen (“Supp. Mullen Decl.”) at ¶ 4. Towson \nUniversity’s TQP grant was terminated in February 2025 by the Department. The TQP grant was \napproved on September 4, 2024, for a period of one year (October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025), \nin the amount of $849,659. Future budget periods were outlined as follows: budget period 2 \n(10/1/2025-9/30/2026) - $811,249; budget period 3 (10/1/2026-9/30/2027) - $1,099,920; budget \nperiod  4  (10/1/2027-9/30/2028)  -  $1,240,123;  budget  period  5  (10/1/2028-9/30/2029)  - \n$1,152,933. Supp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 6. The University of Maryland’s SEED grant was terminated \nin February 2025 by the Department. The terminated SEED grant was approved to begin on \nOctober 1, 2022, for a period of three years, in the amount of $4,808,683. Supp. Mullen Decl. at \n¶ 7. Frostburg State University’s TQP grant was also terminated in February 2025. Supp. Mullen \nDecl. at ¶ 8.  \nThe  Government  represents  that  the  grant  terminations  described  in  the  Complaint \n“occurred in eight states but not in Maryland,” ECF No. 24 at 13, a perplexing assertion not just \nbecause the Plaintiffs attached a declaration to their motion making clear that Maryland programs \nwere impacted by the grant termination (ECF No. 5-5 (stating the grant terminations “result[ed] in \na substantial loss of funds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland”)), but because the \nGovernment cites, and is thus presumably familiar with, litigation proceeding as California v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, in the District of Massachusetts. ECF No. 24 at 11-12, 17 \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 7 of 19\n \n(recognizing that “Maryland grants were terminated”), in which multiple declarations and the \nCourt’s  opinion  entering  a  TRO  confirmed  that  Maryland-based  grants  were  terminated. \nSpecifically,  the  Department  terminated  MACTE  member  Towson  University’s  TQP  grant \nfunding, which effectively terminated Towson’s Preparing and Retaining Inclusive Maryland \nEducators (“PRIME”) project. A true and accurate copy of the Towson declaration filed in that \ncase is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Joshua W.B. Richards (“Richards Decl.”). \nAnother declaration in that case detailed resultant harm of SEED grant termination in Maryland \nfor another MACTE member, the University of Maryland. California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 1:25-\ncv-10548-MJJ, ECF No. 8-15. A true and accurate copy of that declaration is attached as Exhibit \nB to the Richards Declaration. Not only that, but it is a matter of public record, of which this Court \nmay take judicial notice, that Maryland grants were awarded, including those to Towson, Frostburg \nState,  and  the  University  of  Maryland:  https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/teacher-\nprep/teacher-quality-partnership-program#awards,  https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-\nprograms/teacher-prep/supporting-effective-educator-development-grant-program#awards;  It  is \nalso not in matter of reasonable dispute that the Government has terminated all teaching grants. \nSee Richards Decl. Ex. C. Accordingly, a substantial portion of events took place in Maryland and \nvenue in this District is proper pursuant to § 1391(b)(2) as well. \nB.  MACTE has Established Standing. \nTo demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must show “(i) that she has suffered or likely will \nsuffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will be caused by the defendant, \nand (iii) that the injury likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.” FDA v. All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024); Deal v. Mercer Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, \n187 (4th Cir. 2018). “To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 8 of 19\n \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (cleaned up). \nAn organization can establish standing in one of two ways: either “in its own right to seek \njudicial relief for injury to itself,” or “as a representative of its members who have been harmed.” \nPeople for Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v. Tri-State Zoological Park of W. Md., Inc., 843 F. \nApp’x 493, 495 (4th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). An organization must only “make specific \nallegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.” S. \nWalk at Broadlands Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, \n184 (4th Cir. 2013) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 \n(2009)); see also Nat’l Assoc. of Diversity Officers in Higher Ed., et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., \nNo.  1:25-CV-00333-ABA,  2025  WL  573764,  at  *9  (D.  Md.  Feb.  21,  2025)  (“When  an \norganization is alleging harm, it may establish standing based on its own injury or based on its \nmembers’ injuries, the latter of which is called representational or associational standing.”) (citing \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 199 \n(2023)).  \nMoreover, “[a]n organization may have standing to sue on its own behalf for injuries it \nsustains as a result of a defendant’s actions.” Republican Nat’l Comm. v. North Carolina State \nBoard of Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 395 (4th Cir. 2024) (citing Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, \n455 U.S. 363, 379 n.19 (1982)). “[T]he organization must make the necessary showing to \ndemonstrate Article III standing—an injury-in-fact, caused by the defendant, that can be redressed \nby a favorable decision from the court.” Id. (quoting Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 393–94); \nsee also Lane v. Holder, 703 F.3d 668, 674 (4th Cir. 2012) (recognizing that an organization must \nshow it has suffered an “injury in fact,” in that defendant’s “actions impede its efforts to carry out \nits mission.” (citation omitted); Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379 (observing that an organization \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 19\n \nhas standing to sue in its own right if the organization has suffered a “concrete and demonstrable \ninjury to the organization’s activities—with [a] consequent drain on the organization’s resources—\nconstitut[ing] . . . more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests”). \nMACTE has done more than show an “intense interest” or “strong opposition” to the \nchallenged conduct. ECF No. 24 at 16. It has demonstrated that numerous of its members suffered \nactual harm. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 14. If there were any doubt, the Supplemental Mullen Declaration, \nattached hereto, makes the point abundantly clear. Defendants terminated grant funding for three \nMaryland educational institutions, each of which are MACTE members: Towson University, \nSupp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 6; the University of Maryland, Supp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 7; and Frostburg \nState University, Supp. Mullen Decl. at ¶ 8. Because MACTE’s member organizations suffered an \ninjury in fact—i.e., termination of grant funding—MACTE has standing to pursue this action. See \nS. Walk, 713 F.3d at 184. \nTo be sure, the termination of its member organizations’ SEED and/or TQP grants also \nsignificantly  impairs  MACTE’s  core  mission.  ECF  No.  1  at  14.  This  is  a  “concrete  and \ndemonstrable injury” to MACTE that drains its resources. Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs alleged that all of the grant recipients are similarly situated. ECF No. 1 \nat  ¶  6  (“All  of  the  Grant  Recipients  are  similarly  situated  because  the  substance  of  each \nTermination Letter and added terms and conditions in the Grant Award Notifications from the \nDepartment are identical, indicating the same reasons with the same terminology for the grant \nterminations.”). MACTE has, therefore, established organization standing. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 10 of 19\n \nC.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Succeed On The Merits. \n1.  This Court’s NADOHE Order Applies to Plaintiffs in this Action and \nthe Department should be Enjoined from Enforcing the Termination \nof the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \nThe heart of the Government’s argument with respect to the NADOHE order2 is that, yes, \nthe Department terminated the grants at issue here because of DEI, which flowed from the J20 \norder, see ECF No. 24 at 8 (citing Department directives, including one that “Diversity, Equity, \nand Inclusion initiatives unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, or other protected characteristic”) (cleaned up), but, the Government argues, because the \nDepartment terminated the grants before the NADOHE order was issued, neither the order nor the \nreasoning supporting it apply. The Government is wrong.  \nFirst, and as set forth in Plaintiff’s brief, the Government’s argument turns the principles \nunderlying the NADOHE order on their head. The J20 order was unconstitutionally vague because \nit did not sufficiently define what kind of conduct was unlawful, and therefore deprived courts of \nthe ability to test its lawfulness and deprived grant recipients (and others) of the opportunity to \nseek to conform their conduct to the law before being deprived of rights. See Nat’l Assoc. of \nDiversity Officers in Higher Ed., et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 \nWL 573764, at *19-20 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025).  \nThe fact that Plaintiffs here had no opportunity to even attempt to conform their conduct \nbecause the Government acted pursuant to an unlawful order before Plaintiffs sought relief does \n \n2 The Court issued a Clarified Preliminary Injunction on March 10, 2025 in National Association of \nDiversity Officers in Higher Education, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA. The \nClarified Preliminary Injunction redefines “Enjoined Parties” to include: “Defendants other than the \nPresident, as well as all other federal executive branch agencies, departments, and commissions, and their \nheads, officers, agents, and subdivisions directed pursuant to the J20 and J21 Orders[.]” It does not modify \nthe Court’s prior Order issued on February 21, 2025 in any substantive way relevant to this action. \n \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 11 of 19\n \nnot make the J20 order less unconstitutionally vague or, critically, the continued enforcement of \ndeprivations that flowed from the order less unlawful. See Manning v. Caldwell for City of \nRoanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 274 (4th Cir. 2019) (observing that the purpose of the fair notice \nrequirement  is  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  individuals  to  “conform  their  conduct  to  the \nproscriptions of the law”) (citation omitted); see also id. at 278 (condemning unconstitutionally \nvague statutory language that invited arbitrary enforcement). To conclude otherwise would create \nincredible perverse incentives for government officials to shoot first and answer questions later, \nwhich is in fact what seems to have happened here. Plaintiffs’ deprivation was compounded by the \nlack of any real opportunity for a post-deprivation challenge to the termination decisions because \nthe form termination letters failed to provide any specificity about the reason that the Department \nfound any individual grant allegedly “inconsistent with. . . Department priorities.” The form \ntermination letters instead merely list, disjunctively, five vague ways in which the specific grant \nat issue might be “inconsistent” with purported agency priorities.  \nSecond, the Government argues at page 20 of its brief that the “documentary record \nindicates  agency  review;”  this  is  presumably  meant  to  be  contrasted  with  generalized  and \nunreasoned terminations based on the vague and undefined concepts in the J20 Order. The \nGovernment provides no citation to support its assertion of “agency review,” which is, in fact, \nbelied by the record before the Court. The termination letters and Grant Award Notifications \n(“GANs”) filed with the Court, which Plaintiffs have alleged are essentially identical across all \ntheir members’ terminations, see ECF 1 at ¶¶ 5-6, demonstrate that no independent agency review \nof individual grants, underscoring the fears that accompany a vague order like J20.  \nNo exemplar grant termination presented by the Government lists any actual reason that \nany individual grant violates any term or condition of the award, to say nothing of how it might \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 12 of 19\n \nviolate the J20 Order (even if that order were not unlawful). None of the termination letters \npresented by Plaintiffs do either. See ECF No. 1-1 at 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40; ECF No. 1-2 at 1, \n3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13; see also Richards Decl. Ex. A at 68, 72, Ex. B at 68. To the contrary, the \nDepartment undertook no individualized inquiry into specific grants, instead sending a form letter \nand a form basis in each GAN terminating the grants, and then issued a press release.  \nThe Government mounts no serious challenge to the proposition that its terminations of \nPlaintiffs’ members grants would be unlawful under the NADOHE order if undertaken today. Its \nargument that continued enforcement of those terminations is somehow insulated from scrutiny \nunder the same standard lacks any justification and should be rejected by the Court. \n2.  The Department’s Termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants \nViolates the Administrative Procedures Act. \nThe Government does not dispute that the grant terminations at issue here constitute final \nagency action under the APA.  \nIn attempting to justify the terminations, the Government begins by conceding that Federal \nregulations allow agencies to terminate grants for “no other reason” apart from when “an award \nno longer effectuates . . . agency priorities.” ECF No. 24 at 25 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340).3 As an \ninitial matter, the Government points to no explanation as to how the individual terminated awards, \nor even the awards writ large, failed to effectuate those priorities, or what the priorities are, or by \nwhat process the priorities were “issued,” beyond arguing that there are “big picture” priorities \nthat every administration may have and that the grants here were terminated for that reason. The \nclosest the Government comes to articulating a reason is a hedged denial that it was because of \n \n3 While it is true that the failure to effectuate agency priorities is the only ground for termination at issue \nhere, there are actually four reasons a federal award could be terminated, all enumerated in Section \n200.340(a). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 13 of 19\n \nDEI. See Def. Br. at  20 (“Although Plaintiffs assume DOE terminated their grants because of the \nJ20 Executive Order that NADOHE enjoined, DOE does not concede this and the documentary \nrecord indicates independent agency review.”) The Government’s arguments here are neither \ndeveloped nor persuasive. \nFirst, the Government argues that the provision in the Uniform Guidance, 2 CFR Part 200 \n– the federal government rules for grants – stating that the Federal agency can terminate an award \nif it no longer “effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, confusingly \ndoes not actually refer to agency grant Priorities at all. The Government acknowledges that if that \nwere the case, the Priorities would need to be set through notice and comment rulemaking. See \nECF No. 24 at 24. The Government’s reading, divorcing the term “agency priorities” from the \ncontext of grants in which it appears, requires a willful disregard for the provisions that surround \nthe use of the term. Section 200.340 is about termination of grants and 2 C.F.R. Part 200, in which \nit appears, is devoted entirely to the administration of federal awards. Section 200.340(a)(1) states \nthat the terms and conditions of the grant must be followed, and 200.340(a)(4) refers to the goals \nof the grant program or agency priorities. A plain reading of 200.340(a)(4) makes it clear that \nthroughout the subclause, the regulation speaks to different aspects of grants – namely, grant \nprogram goals and grant Priorities, the very Priorities that were set when the grant was awarded \nand which can only be reset through rulemaking.  \nAs explained in Plaintiffs’ brief in support of their motion, the statute governing how the \nEducation Department specifically must set Priorities for grants is GEPA, 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d). \nThe Department of Education is unique in being obliged by a specific statute to use notice and \ncomment rulemaking for grants. GEPA instructs clearly that the ordinary and general APA \nexemption for rulemaking for grants does not apply to the Education Department (except in limited \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 14 of 19\n \ncircumstances, not relevant here). 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d). This matters because the Government \nargues as a policy matter, and erroneously, that if the rule is interpreted to mean what it says, every \nfederal agency would be powerless to shift its activities with new Presidential administrations \nabsent a lengthy public rulemaking process. But in fact, only the Education Department is subject \nto GEPA, and Congress stated that decision unambiguously, so the Government’s argument in that \nregard holds no water.  \nThe parties agree that agency Priorities do and must reflect each Administration’s specific \nmissions and agenda. Even so, Congress specifically passed a law stating that for the Department \nof Education, agency Priorities for grants must go through rulemaking. This Department has not \ndone so, it cannot utilize new, un-set “Priorities” to determine what has or has not been effectuated. \nBut even if the Department’s attenuated position that the words “agency priorities” for \ngrants in the termination regulation did not refer to the same “priorities” explicitly required \nelsewhere in Department grant regulations, it would not change the fact that Defendants still did \nnot follow the proper procedure in terminating the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants in February 2025. \nThe Government’s deflection on agency priorities just opens the door to greater problems. \nThe  Department’s  articulated  reason  for  the  grant  terminations  in  the  GANs  and \ntermination letters, which Defendants repeat in their Opposition, is that the grants were terminated \nbecause they are “inconsistent with,4 and no longer effectuate[], Department priorities,” citing to \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). But Section 200.340(a)(4) actually provides that a federal award may be \nterminated “[b]y the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to the terms and conditions \nof the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates \nthe program goals or agency priorities.” (emphasis added). The word “including,” in this instance, \n \n4 The phrase “inconsistent with” does not appear in the termination regulation. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 15 of 19\n \nmust be read to bring everything that follows it within the scope of the phrase that immediately \nprecedes it, to wit: “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the grant award.” Section 200.340(b) \ngoes  on  to  provide  that  “[t]he  Federal  agency  or  pass-through  entity  must  clearly  and \nunambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.”  \nIn other words, all reasons that the Federal agency may terminate the grant must be “clearly \nand unambiguously” specified in the terms and conditions of that particular grant, and only if the \nterms and conditions specify that the Federal agency may terminate for “no longer effectuat[ing] \n[] agency priorities” in a clear and unambiguous way is the Federal agency permitted to do so. \nThis raises a number of obvious problems for the Government’s proposed alternative reading of \n(a)(4), because the terms and conditions of the Federal awards here contain just one line that states \nthat “2 CFR PART 200.” See Supplemental Declaration of Kathlene Campbell on behalf of NCTR \nEx. A at 4; Richards Decl. Ex. A at 15; Richards Decl. Ex. B at 14. \nThe Government points to nowhere in the Federal awards at issue where the terms and \nconditions specifically state that a grant may be terminated for no longer effectuating actual agency \npriorities, let alone a tortured reading of “agency priorities” so far divorced from the rest of the \nstatutory and regulatory scheme so as to provide for limitless flexibility. It goes without saying, \nthen, that the terms and conditions do not state in a “clear and unambiguous” manner that the \nDepartment may terminate awards on the basis of a change in what the Government somewhat \nmushily calls “big-picture Department priorities,” which require no notice, no reasoned basis, and \nappear to be the definition of the arbitrariness the APA was intended to avoid.  \nIt bears emphasis that agency priorities are not subject to whim. In pointing out the error \nof the Government’s argument on this point, and the implications of their argument, Plaintiffs are \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 16 of 19\n \nnot inviting the Court to rule on matters beyond the scope of those necessary to resolve the claims \nat issue; this motion can and should be resolved by ruling that “agency priorities” do not change \nwithout rulemaking, and the Department has neither engaged in rulemaking nor explained how \nany of the terminated grants have ceased to effectuate priorities they met when they were awarded. \nBut in the event the Court finds it necessary to test the Government’s contrary argument, the \nGovernment fails in its task because nothing approaching the level of discretion to unilaterally \nterminate appeared alongside “2 CFR PART 200” in Plaintiffs’ notices of award, so regardless of \nwhat “agency priorities” in the termination provision refers to, the Department failed to follow its \nregulations. \nD.  Government’s Argument with Respect to the Scope of Relief. \nThe Government argues that if relief is granted, it should be limited in two ways. First, the \nGovernment argues that if granted, a preliminary injunction should be limited in scope to include \nonly the terminated grants of those member organizations which were specifically identified by \nname in Plaintiffs’ Complaint. However, the Government fails to acknowledge that Plaintiffs \nalleged that all of the grant recipients are similarly situated. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 6 (“All of the Grant \nRecipients are similarly situated because the substance of each Termination Letter and added terms \nand conditions in the Grant Award Notifications from the Department are identical, indicating the \nsame reasons with the same terminology for the grant terminations.”). Simply providing relief to \nthe member organizations which submitted Declarations in conjunction with the Complaint would \ndeprive all of the similarly situated member organizations the relief to which they are similarly \nentitled and subject them to harm that the Government has already conceded is irreparable. See \nalso Richards Decl. Ex. C (email from the Department on February 21, 2025 confirming that “[a]ll \nthe grants have been terminated[.]”). Accordingly, it would be inequitable for relief to be limited \nin the manner suggested by the Government. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 17 of 19\n \nSecond, while it is unclear if the Government is asking for the Court to remand the matter \nto the Department to provide an explanation for each grant termination in the absence of a \npreliminary injunction, or to limit an injunction to such relief, in any event, such a remand would \nlikewise perpetuate irreparable harm and is accordingly inequitable and not in the public interest \nas a remedy.  \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Request for Removing the Route Pay Condition is Clear. \nWhile the Government attempts to sidestep responding to Plaintiffs’ allegations with \nrespect to route pay by briefly arguing that Plaintiffs’ reference to route pay is unclear, that is \nsimply not the case. Not only does Plaintiffs’ brief devote an entire section to detail how the \nimposition of the route pay condition is unlawful (ECF No. 5-1 at 33-34), but Plaintiffs’ Motion \nexpressly requests relief in the form of ordering Defendants to “[r]emoving the route pay grant \nconditions from TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.” ECF No. 5 at 2. Plaintiffs’ request is clear, as is its \nright to relief, and so Plaintiffs continue to request that its right to preliminary relief sought in its \nmotion not be impaired by the Department unlawfully placing further roadblocks in the way of \ntheir continued access to grant funding. \nIII.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, and the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in \nSupport of Their Motion for Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the Court enter a preliminary injunction consistent with its request.  \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 25     Filed 03/12/25     Page 18 of 19\n \nDated: March 12, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Joshua W.B.

INTRODUCTION \nIn just a few days, the Court’s Preliminary Injunction Order (“Order) will force the \nDepartment of Education (“DOE”) to release an extraordinary amount of funding to more than \nseventy terminated grant recipients.  There is no guarantee DOE will be able to recover any of this \nmoney if they are ultimately victorious in this litigation.  And because the Court lacked subject \nmatter jurisdiction over the Complaint, its Order was likely erroneous. \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  In partially granting Plaintiffs’ motion for \na preliminary injunction, this Court acted without subject matter jurisdiction.  The Court of Federal \nClaims has exclusive jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ complaint, which is at essence a claim for \nmonetary damages exceeding $10,000.  Moreover, decisions to terminate funding are discretionary \nand thus not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).   \nAs a result, Defendants respectfully request that the Court reconsider its order imposing a \npreliminary injunction in this case, instead vacating the order and dismissing the Complaint.  \nDefendants seek a decision on an extremely expedited time frame given the scale of the Order. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 2 of 9\nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn March 3, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint and Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder or Preliminary Injunction (“Motion”).  ECF 1; ECF 5.  The Complaint and Motion arose \nfrom  DOE’s  decision to  terminate grants  awarded through the Teacher Quality  Partnership \nProgram (“TQP”), the Supporting Effective Educator Development Program (“SEED”), and the \nTeacher and School Leader Incentive Program (“TSL”).  ECF 1 at 2.  Plaintiffs alleged that this \ndecision was unconstitutionally vague in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights and arbitrary \nand capricious in violation of the APA.  Id. at 36–37. \nThe Parties briefed the Motion on an expedited schedule and the Court held a hearing on \nMarch 13, 2025.  ECF 18.  On March 17, 2025, the Court determined that Plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed on their APA  claims because the DOE likely  acted arbitrarily and capriciously in \nterminating the grants.  ECF 32 at 30–42.  The Court also determined that Plaintiffs Fifth \nAmendment claims were unlikely to succeed.  Id. at 24–30. \nThe Court issued a preliminary injunction (the “Order”) on March 17, 2025, requiring DOE \nto reinstate the affected grants and enjoining DOE from terminating “any TQP, SEED, or TSL \nGrant Program award in a manner this court has determined is likely unlawful.”  ECF 33 at 1–2.  \nThe Order requires DOE to reinstate the subject grants within five business days from the date of \nthe order.  Id. at 1. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Rule 12(b)(1) - lack of subject matter jurisdiction \nBefore a court may rule on the merits of a claim, it must first determine if “it has the \njurisdiction over the category of claim in suit (subject [] matter jurisdiction).” Sinochem Int’l Co. \nLtd. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430–31 (2007) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens \nfor a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 93–102 (1998)).  The burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 3 of 9\nrests with the plaintiff. See Evans v. B.F. Perkins Co., 166 F.3d 642, 647 (4th Cir. 1999).  The \nrequirement that a plaintiff establish subject matter jurisdiction “as a threshold matter springs from \nthe nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States and is inflexible and without \nexception.”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 95 (internal quotation omitted).  In determining whether subject \nmatter jurisdiction exists “as a threshold matter,” id., a court “may consider evidence outside the \npleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment,” Evans, 166 F.3d at \n647; see also Williams v. United States, 50 F.3d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding that a court may \nconsider exhibits outside pleadings).  Challenges to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction “may \nbe raised at any time,” even after losing at trial and even if a party “previously acknowledged the \ntrial court’s jurisdiction.”  Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 434–35 (2011). \nB.  Rule 54(b) - motion for reconsideration \nInterlocutory  orders  “may  be  revised  at  any  time  before  the  entry  of  a  judgment \nadjudicating all the claims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). A \ndistrict court has discretion “to reconsider and modify its interlocutory judgments” with the “goal \n. . . [of] reach[ing] the correct judgment under law.”  In re Sinclair Broad. Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., \n473 F. Supp. 3d 529, 534 (D. Md. 2020) (internal quotations omitted) (citing Am. Canoe Ass’n v. \nMurphy Farms, Inc., 326 F.3d 505, 514 (4th Cir. 2003)).  A court may consider new evidence and \narguments on a motion to reconsider.  Lynn v. Monarch Recovery Mgm’t, Inc., 953 F. Supp. 2d \n612, 619–20 (D. Md. 2013). \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nTo sue a federal agency, a plaintiff must identify an express waiver in the text of a federal \nlaw and show that its claim falls within the waiver’s scope.  See FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290 \n(2012) (“a waiver of sovereign immunity must be ‘unequivocally expressed’ in statutory text”).  \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to rely on the APA, which includes a limited waiver of sovereign immunity \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 4 of 9\nfor claims “seeking relief other than money damages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  That limited waiver does \nnot, however, extend to this action because Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks to access funding that it \nbelieves the government is obligated to pay under a grant.  Under these circumstances, relief under \nthe APA is inappropriate and instead must be brought under the Tucker Act.  28 U.S.C. § 1491.  \nBecause the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over claims under the Tucker Act, \nthis Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction.  28 U.S.C. § \n1491(a)(1).  See also Robbins v. U.S. Bur. Of Land Mgm’t, 438 F.3d 1074, 1082 (10th Cir. 2006).  \nAlternatively, decisions to terminate or reallocate funding are committed to agency discretion and \nthus fall outside the APA’s scope. \nA.  This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint because the \nCourt of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over claims for monetary \ndamages exceeding $10,000. \nWhere a party asks the Court to restore millions of dollars in terminated grant funding, the \nCourt of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction.  Courts have consistently held that an APA \nclaim that actually seeks monetary relief is in essence a claim for monetary damages exceeding \n$10,000.  See, e.g., Great-W. Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 210 (2002); \nPortsmouth Redev. & Hous. Auth. v. Pierce, 706 F.2d 471, 474 (4th Cir. 1983) (vacating district \ncourt order); Ganiszewski v. Austin, No. 23-cv-2195-BAH, 2024 WL 4227759, at *9 (D. Md. Sept. \n17, 2024).  And because the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims, \nthis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case.  \nThe Tucker Act provides that the “United States Court of Federal Claims shall have \njurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded” on “any express \nor implied contract with the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a).  Where such a claim “seek[s] \nmonetary  relief  in  excess  of  $10,000,”  the  Tucker  Act  “vest[s]  subject  matter  jurisdiction \nexclusively in the Claims Court.”  Portsmouth, 706 F.2d at 473.  See also 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 5 of 9\nCourts have routinely held that grants are included, holding, “grant agreements [are] contracts \nwhen the standard conditions for a contract are satisfied.”  Columbus Reg’l Hosp. v. United States, \n990 F.3d 1330, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also San Juan City Coll. v. United States, 391 F.3d \n1357, 1360-62 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (treating a “Program Participation Agreement” and related grants \nunder the Higher Education Act as a contract). \nTo determine whether a claim seeks monetary damages, courts look beyond the label a \nplaintiff gives to the relief requested. James v. Caldera, 159 F.3d 573, 579 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  The \nfact that a complaint seeks only equitable relief on its face does not end the inquiry; instead, courts \nconsider the “essence” of the claim to decide if it is monetary or not.  Randall v. United States, 95 \nF.3d 339, 347 (4th Cir. 1996).  See also James, 159 F.3d at 579 (“Our inquiry, however, does not \nend with the words of the complaint, however instructive they may be, for we still must look to \nthe true nature of the action in determining the existence or not of jurisdiction.” (internal quotation \nomitted)).  An action compelling the government to pay money “past due under a contract” is an \naction at law, not equity.  Great-W., 534 U.S. at 210.  Where a complaint effectively seeks \n“declaratory or injunctive relief . . . in the form of specific performance” against the government, \nTucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and “the APA thus does not waive sovereign immunity for \nsuch claims.”  Robbins, 438 F.3d at 1082.   \nChallenges to agreements terminated under 2 C.F.R. § 240.340 fall under the Tucker Act \nwhere a plaintiff “wants the Government to keep paying up.”  Mem. Order, U.S. Conf. of Catholic \nBishops v. U.S. Dept. of State, No. 1:25-cv-00465 (TNM), ECF 37 at 10 (attached as ECF No. 36-\n3).  Where an action “seeks the classic contractual remedy of specific performance,” only the Court \nof Federal Claims may resolve the dispute.  Id. (quoting Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, \n764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Just last week, the District of Columbia dismissed a similar \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 6 of 9\ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the plaintiff’s contract was terminated \npursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 240.340.  See generally ECF 36-3.  The Court held that it “lacks the power” \nto “cancel the termination, pay money due, and reinstate the contracts.”  Id. at 12.  In Maryland, \nJudge Hurson recently considered a different but analogous issue and determined that a service \nmember’s equitable request that the court revise his disability rating upward – a revision that would \nresult in the award of monetary disability payments – was actually a request for monetary damages \nthat fell outside the APA’s scope and within the Tucker Act.  Ganiszewski, 2024 WL 4227759, at \n*9.  See also, Portsmouth, 706 F.2d at 474 (“[Federal] Claims Court jurisdiction cannot be avoided \nby framing an essentially monetary claim in injunctive or declaratory terms.”). \nPlaintiffs seek precisely such avoidant framing here.  Although Plaintiffs facially seek the \nequitable remedy of grant reinstatement, as the Complaint and Motion make clear, the heart of \ntheir remedy is both contractual and monetary.  Both the Complaint and Motion repeatedly state \nthe importance of the grant funding for Plaintiffs’ continued existence.  See generally, ECF 1, 5.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs urgently sought grant reinstatement without any conditions so that they could \nimmediately resume withdrawing money from their grant accounts.  See, e.g., ECF 5 at 22, 36.  \nAnd the Court awarded such monetary damages in its Order, requiring DOE to reinstate all subject \ngrants and effectively allow Plaintiffs to immediately resume drawing down their grant accounts.  \nECF 33.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have repeatedly based their claims on violations to the terms and \nconditions of the grant awards.  See, e.g., ECF 25 at 13–15.  \nBecause the essence of this complaint is monetary relief and specific enforcement of a \ncontract, it falls under the Tucker Act and this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 7 of 9\nB.  The grant terminations were discretionary and thus fall outside the scope of \njudicial review under the APA. \nThe Court’s lack of subject matter jurisdiction constitutes necessary and sufficient grounds \nto vacate the Order and dismiss this case.  But the Court should also reconsider and vacate its \ndecision because the challenged “agency action” is “committed to agency discretion by law” and \ntherefore falls outside the scope of permissible judicial review under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § \n701(a)(2).  The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction because the Department’s decisions here—which \nconcerned how best to re-allocate funds to align with its policy objectives—were quintessential \ndecisions committed to agency discretion by law. \nIn Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), the Supreme Court held that the Indian Health \nService’s decision to discontinue a program it had previously funded and to instead reallocate those \nfunds to other programs was committed to agency discretion by law and thus not reviewable under \nthe APA’s reasoned-decisionmaking standards.  See id. at 185–88.  The Court explained that the \n“allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is” an “administrative decision traditionally \nregarded as committed to agency discretion,” because the “very point of a lump-sum appropriation \nis to give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory \nresponsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Id. at 192. \nIndeed, “an agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation requires ‘a \ncomplicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise’: whether \nits ‘resources are best spent’ on one program or another; whether it ‘is likely to succeed’ in \nfulfilling its statutory mandate; whether a particular program ‘best fits the agency’s overall \npolicies’; and, ‘indeed, whether the agency has enough resources’ to fund a program ‘at all.’”  Id. \nat 193.  “Congress may always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting \nrestrictions in the operative statutes.”  Id.  But as long as the agency abides by the relevant statutes \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 8 of 9\n(and whatever self-imposed obligations may arise from regulations or grant instruments), the APA \n“gives the courts no leave to intrude.”  Id. \nThe TQP, TSL, and SEED grant programs here confer significant discretion in determining \nhow best to allocate appropriated funds across applicants.  The statute governing TQP grants \nprovides simply that “the Secretary is authorized to award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible \npartnerships, to enable the eligible partnerships to carry out” certain specified activities.  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1022a(a), (c).  The TSL grant statute contains nearly identical language.  20 U.S.C. § 6632(a).  \nSimilarly, the SEED grant statute generally directs the Secretary to “award grants, on a competitive \nbasis, to  eligible entities for” five specified “purposes,” such as “providing evidence-based \nprofessional  development  activities”  and  “making  freely  available  services  and  learning \nopportunity to local educational agencies.”  20 U.S.C. § 6672(a).  No statute constrains the \nSecretary’s discretion to determine how best to allocate the funding for each program among many \ndifferent potential grant recipients, except for certain award priorities.  See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § \n6672(e) (giving SEED grant priority to “evidence-based activities”); 20 U.S.C. § 6632(d) (giving \nTSL priority to “high-need schools” and instructing fair distribution of grants “between rural and \nurban areas”).  Accordingly, DOE’s decisions in this context are discretionary decisions regarding \nhow to allocate funds, not subject to arbitrary-and-capricious review under the APA.  As this Court \nacknowledged in its memorandum opinion, DOE likely terminated the grants at issue not because \nof a Presidential command but potentially “because the Department head devised her own action \nitems for the Department going forward.”  ECF 32 at 30 n.11. \nAny  suggestion  that  Lincoln  does  not  apply  because  a  single  regulation—2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4)—sufficiently constrains the Department’s discretion is unavailing. This regulation \nreinforces, rather than restricts, the Department’s discretion—making clear that the agency may \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 36-1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 9 of 9\ncancel a grant if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  2 C.F.R. § \n200.340(a)(4).  The effect  of terminating the specific grants  at  issue  here is  to  enable the \nDepartment to award the remaining funds to other grant recipients and eligible applicants.  That \nis, by definition, a decision to re-allocate funds. \nAs such, the APA does not allow for consideration of the grant terminations at issue here. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nBecause the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case, the Court should \nreconsider its order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  The Court should \nfurther vacate its order and dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKelly O.

INTRODUCTION .............................................................................................................. 7 \nII.  BACKGROUND FACTS ................................................................................................... 8 \nA.  Department of Education (“DOE”) terminated a number of grants that participated \nin Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) programming. .................................... 8 \nB.  On February 21, 2025, Judge Adam Abelson in the District of Maryland enjoined \nthe government from enforcing three provisions in the J20 and J21 orders. ........ 10 \nC.  The evening of March 10, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of \nMassachusetts entered a temporary restraining order in an APA challenge to DOE \ngrant termination that provides relief to at least some of the Plaintiffs in this action.\n............................................................................................................................... 11 \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD ....................................................................................................... 12 \nIV.  ARGUMENT .................................................................................................................... 12 \nA.  Venue is not proper in the State of Maryland because no substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred here. ................................. 13 \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 2 of 32\n \n \nB.  The complaint lacks sufficient facts to establish Plaintiff MACTE’s organizational \nstanding. ................................................................................................................ 16 \nC.  Plaintiffs cannot piggyback on NADOHE’s analysis because NADOHE is not \nbinding and they are differently situated. ............................................................. 17 \n1.  NADOHE’s  holding  hinged  on  First  Amendment  violations  but  these \nPlaintiffs have no First Amendment claim. ............................................. 18 \n2.  NADOHE held that the likelihood of establishing vagueness stemmed from \nuncertainty regarding grant termination, but the instant Plaintiffs have \nalready had their grants terminated. ........................................................ 19 \n3.  NADOHE challenged the potential enforcement of the J20 termination \nprovision, while the instant case challenges an actual agency decision not \ndefinitively tied to the J20 termination provision. .................................. 20 \nD.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their vagueness claim. ........... 21 \nE.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their APA claim because enacting a new \nadministration’s  priorities,  consistent  with  federal  law,  is  not  arbitrary  or \ncapricious. ............................................................................................................. 23 \nF.  Two of the final three preliminary injunction factors – balance of equities and \npublic interest – weigh in favor of the Government. ............................................ 27 \nG.  To the extent the Court is inclined to grant a preliminary injunction, it should \ninstead remand to DOE for further development of the record. ........................... 29 \nH.  If the Court grants a preliminary injunction, its scope should be limited only to the \ncancelled grants identified in Plaintiffs’ motion. .................................................. 30 \nV.

INTRODUCTION \nThis Court should reject Plaintiffs’ attempt to glom onto Judge Abelson’s decision in \nNational Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education (“NADOHE”) v. Trump.1  Despite \nadvancing no First Amendment claims, Plaintiffs argue that the more stringent Fifth Amendment \nvagueness standard applicable to free speech challenges applied in NADOHE should apply to \nthem.  And despite receiving concrete grant terminations specifying the reasons for their grant \nterminations, Plaintiffs argue that NADOHE’s analysis about potentially vague grant terminations \nin the abstract should also apply to them.  These arguments lack merit.  Not only is venue improper \nin Maryland and not only does the only Maryland plaintiff lack standing, but Plaintiffs are also \nunlikely to succeed on the merits of their Due Process or Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) \nclaims.  Because the balance of equities and public interest also weigh in favor of the government, \nthe  Court  must  deny  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  Preliminary  Injunction  (“PI”)  or  Temporary \nRestraining Order (“TRO”). \n \n \n1   ECF 1 No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA.  Hereafter, “NADOHE.” \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 8 of 32\n \n \nII.  BACKGROUND FACTS \nA.  Department of Education (“DOE”) terminated grants that participated in \nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) programming. \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,151, 90 FR 8339, \nentitled Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Program and Preferencing [hereafter J20]. \nJ20  sought  to  eliminate  “illegal  and  immoral  discrimination  programs,  going  by  the  name \n‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI),” in the Government.  J20 § 1. As is relevant here, J20 \nincludes a Termination Provision, which directs that within 60 days of its issuance, “[e]ach agency, \ndepartment, or commission head, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, \nand the Director of OPM … terminate . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts.”  Id. § 2(b)(i).  This \nhas been referred to as the “Termination Provision.”  The President also issued a second executive \norder related to DEI on January 21, 2025 [hereafter J21], but Plaintiffs do not challenge that order. \nOn February 5, 2025, DOE’s Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development \nissued a “Directive on Department Grant Priorities.”  ECF 24-2 (Directive on Development Grant \nPriorities, U.S. Dept. of Educ. (Feb. 5, 2025)) [hereafter, “DOE Directive”].  Available online at \nPrem  Thakker,  X.com,  https://x.com/prem_thakker/status/1887261853350318163?s=46  (last \naccessed Mar. 11, 2025).  The internal directive reaffirms the Department’s priority “to eliminate \ndiscrimination in all forms of education.”  ECF 24-2 (DOE Directive) (citing to Brown v. Board \nof Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Fellows of Harvard \nColl., 600 U.S. 181 (2023) [hereafter “SFFA”]).  It notes that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \n(“DEI”) initiatives “unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, or other protected characteristic” and “conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing \nmerit, fairness, and excellence in education.”  Id.  The directive instructs DOE personnel to conduct \na review of issued grants to ensure they “do not fund discriminatory practices – including in the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 9 of 32\n \n \nform of DEI – that are either contrary to law or to the Department’s policy objectives.”  Id.  The \ndirective further requires DOE to “comply with all notice and procedural requirements in each \naffected award, agreement, or other instrument.”  Id.  Finally, it notes that “[g]rants deemed \ninconsistent with these priorities shall, where permitted by applicable law, be terminated in \ncompliance with all notice and procedural requirements.”  Id.  The directive does not reference \nany executive order related to DEI but rather relies on DOE’s own policies and priorities.  Id. \nPlaintiffs are member organizations comprised of some members who received grant \nmoney from three DOE programs:  The Teacher Quality Partnership Program (“TQP”); the \nSupporting Effective Educator Development Program (“SEED”); and the Teacher and School \nLeader Incentive Program (“TSL”).  The grants were multi-year grants meant to support teacher \nprofessional development and training programs.  ECF 1 at ¶¶ 65–127.  Plaintiffs’ programs \nincluded diversity, equity, and inclusion components.  See, e.g., ECF 1 at ¶¶ 79, 81, 101.   \nThe  complaint  alleges  that  between  approximately  February  7  and  18,  2025,  DOE \nterminated eight of its member association grants.  ECF 1 at ¶¶ 119–27 (describing anonymous \ngrant recipient); ECF 1-2 (identifying named grant recipients).  The termination letters specified \nthat the grants were terminated for “promot[ing] or tak[ing] part in diversity, equity, and inclusion \n(“DEI”) initiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic.”  See, e.g., ECF 1-2 at 4.  The \nletter noted that the grants “no longer effectuate[] Department priorities” pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § \n200.340(a)(4).  Each letter included statutory authority for the action, advised recipients of their \nappeal rights, and advised regarding closeout responsibilities.  See, e.g., ECF 1-2 at 4–5.  No letter \nreferenced any Presidential Executive Order as a source of authority. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 10 of 32\n \n \nB.  On February 21, 2025, Judge Adam Abelson in the District of Maryland \nenjoined the government from enforcing three provisions in the J20 and J21 \norders. \nThe District of Maryland was one of the first courts in the country to hear a challenge to \nthe J20 and J21 orders.  In NADOHE, Judge Abelson considered a challenge to three provisions in \nthe orders, including a provision in the J20 order that called for government agencies to “terminate. \n. . equity-related’ grants or contracts.”2  See generally, NADOHE, ECF 1, No. 1:25-CV-00333-\nABA.  The NADOHE Plaintiffs were federal grant recipients whose grants remained active, but \nwho feared termination pursuant to the J20 order.  See, e.g., NADOHE, ECF 1 at ¶¶ 5–6.  They \nclaimed that the fear of losing their funding chilled their freedom of speech, as they were afraid \nthat engaging with DEI values would cause them to lose their funding.  Id. at ¶ 12.  They also \nclaimed the J20 order was vague because it “failed to define any material terms, including ‘DEI,’ \n‘illegal DEI,’ ‘DEI programs or principles,’ or ‘illegal discrimination or preferences.’”  Id. at ¶ 4.  \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for a TRO or PI about ten days after filing the complaint.  NADOHE, ECF \n27.  Because no plaintiff grants had been terminated, the challenge was a “facial” challenge to the \nentire order without reference to how the order might be applied in any individual case.  NADOHE, \n__ F. Supp. 3d. __, 2025 WL 573764, at *16 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025). \nJudge  Abelson  held  a  hearing  and  ultimately  granted  the  plaintiffs’  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction on February 21, 2025.  In so doing, Judge Abelson considered the plaintiffs’ \nFifth Amendment challenge to the J20 order’s termination provision through the lens of a free \nspeech challenge, applying “a more stringent vagueness test.”  NADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, at \n \n \n2   NADOHE also challenged the J21 Executive Order, but since that Order is not the subject \nof the instant lawsuit it is not discussed here. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 11 of 32\n \n \n*26.  Applying this more rigorous test, Judge Abelson determined that plaintiffs were likely to \nshow that the termination provision did not provide sufficient notice of prohibited activity and \ncarried the potential for arbitrary enforcement.  Id. at *19–21.  Because no NADOHE plaintiff had \nexperienced a grant termination, Judge Abelson’s ruling considered the general landscape and \nhypothetical scenarios.  See id. at *20.  His preliminary injunction order prevented “Defendants \nother than the President, and other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nDefendants,” from, in relevant part, “paus[ing], freez[ing], imped[ing], block[ing], cancel[ing], or \nterminat[ing] any awards, contracts, or obligations (“Current Obligations”) or change the terms of \nany Current Obligation, on the basis of the Termination Provision.”  ECF 1-3 at 3 (NADOHE \nPreliminary Injunction Order). \nOn March 10, 2025, following supplemental motions practice, Judge Abelson clarified that \n“persons who are in active concert or participation with Defendants” meant “all other federal \nexecutive branch agencies, departments, and commissions, and their heads, officers, agents, and \nsubdivisions directed pursuant to the J20 and J21 Orders.”  NADOHE, ECF 67 at 3.  Neither the \ninitial order nor the clarified order applied retroactively to any grants cancelled before entry of the \norder on February 21, 2025.  The clarified order reiterated that NADOHE’s holding regarding \nvagueness of the J20 termination provision utilized “the more stringent vagueness test that applies \nwhen a law interferes with the right of free speech or of association.”  NADOHE, ECF 66 at 5. \nC.  The evening of March 10, 2025, the United States District Court for the District \nof Massachusetts entered a temporary restraining order in an APA challenge \nto DOE grant termination that provides relief to at least some of the Plaintiffs \nin this action. \nOn March 6, 2025, the States of California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNew Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin filed a motion for temporary restraining order challenging \nthe allegedly arbitrary and capricious termination of TQP and SEED grants.  See generally, Mot. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 12 of 32\n \n \nfor Temp. Restr’g O., California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, ECF No. 2 (D. Mass. \nMar. 6, 2025).  Judge Joun held a hearing on March 10, 2025, seemingly without the benefit of \nwritten briefing from the government.  See generally, ECF 24-3 (Docket, 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ \n(reflecting no motion response from the government)).  After the hearing, the Judge Joun granted \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and required DOE to “immediately restore . . \n. all previously awarded TQP or SEED grants for recipients in Plaintiff states.”  ECF 24-4 (Order, \nCalifornia v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, ECF No. 41, at 9 (D. Mass. Mar. 6, 2025)). \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is “extraordinary” relief that may “only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n22,  24  (2008).    Plaintiffs  must  satisfy  four  elements  to  show  entitlement  to  a  preliminary \ninjunction:  first, they must show that they are likely to succeed on the merits; second, that they \nwill likely experience irreparable harm unless the court grants relief; third, that the balance of \nequities weighs in their favor; and fourth that an injunction is in the public interest.  Frazier v. \nPrince George’s Cnty., 86 F.4th 537, 543 (4th Cir. 2023); NADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, at *7.  \nThe last two factors – balance of equities and the public interest – “merge when the Government \nis the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).   \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs cannot establish entitlement to a preliminary injunction.  Their case fails at the \nthreshold due to improper venue and lack of standing.  The Court should decline to extend the \nNADOHE holding to these Plaintiffs due to the dissimilarity of their claims.  On the merits, \nPlaintiffs’ case fails because their actual grant terminations were not vague as applied to them.  \nNor did DOE act arbitrarily and capriciously when it terminated Plaintiffs’ grants consistently with \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 13 of 32\n \n \nits departmental priorities.  For the purposes of this motion, Defendants do not dispute that \nPlaintiffs can establish irreparable harm, but the government does contend that the balance of \nequities and public interest weighs in the government’s favor.  Should the Court consider granting \nrelief, Defendants respectfully request that the Court instead remand to DOE to provide a more \ndetailed explanation for each grant termination.  Finally, if the Court does issue a PI, Defendants \nask that the injunction be limited only to the named grants in Plaintiffs’ complaint and motion. \nA.  Venue is not proper in the State of Maryland because no substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred here. \nThis Court should decline to hear this case because it does not belong in the State of \nMaryland.  In cases based on federal question jurisdiction, venue is only proper in a district where \neither a defendant resides or where “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) (providing additional venue grounds not relevant here).  \nBecause no defendant resides in Maryland and because the grant terminations at issue occurred in \neight states but not in Maryland, venue is not proper here. \nAlthough cases involving the federal government are often appropriately brought in the \nDistrict of Columbia, this may not be appropriate where it would lead to a crush of litigation.  In \ncases involving national organizations “challeng[ing] agency action of nationwide scope,” the \nDistrict of Columbia is nearly always the most convenient venue.  Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO \nv. Bingham, 570 F.2d 965, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  However, this may not be true where a given \ndistrict has “limited manpower to process a large number of claims.”  Chakrabarti v. U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Servs., No 21-1945 PJM, 2021 WL 4458899, at *5 (D. Md. Sept. 29, \n2021).  Just a few years ago, this District declined to become the default district for hundreds of \nlawsuits alleging delays in adjudication of immigration applications, merely because the offices of \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services moved to the state.  Id. at *5.  Rather, the court \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 14 of 32\n \n \nnoted that hearing adjudication delay cases in each plaintiff’s home district would decrease the \nburden on the District of Maryland and prevent “derogat[ion] from the other important matters the \nCourt must attend to.”  Id. at *6. \nMoreover,  simply  naming  one  organizational  Plaintiff  headquartered  in  a  state  who \nexperienced little or no actual harm is not sufficient to establish that “a substantial part of the \nevents” occurred in that given state.  Cf. Wolf v. Menh, No. 1:18-cv-1180, 2019 WL 13292992, at \n*3 (E.D. Va. Feb. 5, 2019) (finding receipt of defamatory statements by Virginia individuals and \ninvolvement of “a Virginia organization” did not amount to “a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claim”).  Similarly, the fact that some portion of events are experienced \nin Maryland is not sufficient to establish “a substantial part” where most events occur outside the \nstate.  Chakrabarti, 2021 WL 4458899, at *3, 7. \nJudge Gallagher recently signaled her concern about the District of Maryland becoming a \ndefault district for litigation stemming from President Trump’s policies.  In Am. Fed. of Teachers, \net al. v. Dept. of Ed., which involves similar allegations as those in the instant case, Judge \nGallagher observed that the complaint contained only “generalized facts describing the impact of \ncertain  executive  actions  on  members  of  two  nationwide  professional  organizations,”  and \n“specific, detailed facts” relating to impacts in another state.  Letter Order, Am. Fed. of Teachers, \net al. v. Dept. of Ed., No. 25-cv-628-SAG, ECF 16 at 1 (Mar. 5, 2025).  The only connection to \nMaryland was not any “harm occurring in the State of Maryland,” but rather “the naming of \n[American Federation of Teacher’s] AFT’s Maryland chapter as a separate Plaintiff without \nidentifying any particularized injury to the Maryland chapter distinct from the national chapter.”  \nId. (“It thus appears to this Court that the Maryland chapter was named separately solely to \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 15 of 32\n \n \nmanufacture venue in this District.”).  Judge Gallagher ordered briefing about venue but has not \nyet ruled on the issue.  Id.   \nHer concerns are not misplaced.  According to the “Trump Litigation Tracker” compiled \nby JustSecurity.org, approximately twelve challenges to the administration’s actions have been \nfiled in Maryland so far, second only to the District of Columbia, which has more than sixty.  See \nLitigation  Tracker:    Legal  Challenges  to  Trump  Administration  Actions, \nhttps://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/ \n(Last visited Mar. 10, 2025). \nLike AFT and Chakrabarti, venue in this case is not proper in Maryland.  Plaintiffs are two \nnational professional organizations and one Maryland chapter.  See e.g., ECF 1 at ¶ 14.  The \ncomplaint’s utter lack of connection to Maryland is so striking that not only is the sole Maryland \nplaintiff the third of three named Plaintiffs, but that plaintiff’s principal place of business in \nTowson, Maryland is misspelled “Townson” – twice.  Id.  The complaint contains no allegations \nof any grant terminations in Maryland, and the declaration of Plaintiff Maryland Association of \nColleges for Teacher Education’s (“MACTE”) President does not specify whether actual grants \nwere terminated in the State of Maryland, only that three of ten member organizations were \n“impacted by the termination” of SEED and TQP grants.  The complaint does not specifically \nmention any Maryland grant terminations, but only avers that the termination of others’ grants \n“implicates MACTE’s core mission.”  ECF 1 at ¶ 14.  In contrast, the complaint and associated \ndocuments allege specific allegations of injury occurring in Illinois, Minnesota, California, District \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 16 of 32\n \n \nof Columbia, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, and Arkansas.  See ECF 1-2 at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14; \nECF 1 at ¶ 112.  Given these facts, venue is unlikely to be proper in Maryland.3 \nThe Court should decline to hear this preliminary injunction challenge and instead allow \nthe parties to brief the issue of venue transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404. \nB.  The  complaint  lacks  sufficient  facts  to  establish  Plaintiff  MACTE’s \norganizational standing. \nThe only Plaintiff with any Maryland connection, MACTE, lacks organizational standing.  \n“[A] plaintiff must establish that he has standing to challenge each provision . . . by showing that \nhe was injured by application of those provisions.”  Covenant Media of SC, LLC v. N. Charleston, \n493 F.3d 421, 430 (4th Cir. 2007).  To establish standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an “injury in \nfact,” that is, a violation of a legally protected interest that is “concrete and particularized” and \n“actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) a causal connection between the injury \nand the defendant’s conduct such that the injury is “fairly . . . traceable to the challenged action”; \nand (3) that it is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).   \nAn organizational plaintiff cannot establish standing merely by showing an “intens[e]. . . \ninterest” in the case or “strong opposition to the government’s conduct.”  Valley Forge Christian \nColl. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 486 (1982).  The \nSupreme Court has emphasized that “threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute \n \n \n3   As in Chakrabarti, the government currently intends to move to transfer venue to the \nindividual states in which Plaintiffs’ grants were cancelled given the current crush of litigation in \nthe District of Columbia. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 17 of 32\n \n \ninjury in fact, and that allegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.” Clapper v. Amnesty \nInt’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) (citations omitted).   \nThe complaint and motion for preliminary injunction lack specific allegations regarding \nactual injury to MACTE.  Rather, the complaint alleges only an “implicat[ion of] MACTE’s core \nmission.”  ECF 1 at ¶ 14.  The declaration drafted by MACTE’s President does not specifically \nidentify any Maryland grants that were cancelled, but only alleges that three of its ten member \norganizations were “impacted by the termination of the grants . . . resulting in a substantial loss of \nfunds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland.”  ECF 5-5 at 2.  Unlike the other allegations \nin the complaint and preliminary injunction motion, there is no indication of which member grants \nwere cancelled if any, or how much money was lost.  See generally, e.g., ECF 1-2 (identifying \ncancelled  grants  in  Illinois,  Minnesota,  California,  and  District  of  Columbia,  but  none  in \nMaryland). \nMoreover, to the extent Maryland grants were terminated, Maryland has already received \nrelief in a different case.  See Order, California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, ECF \nNo. 41 (D. Mass. Mar. 6, 2025) (requiring DOE to “immediately restore” terminated TQP and \nSEED grants for recipients in Maryland, California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, \nNew York, and Wisconsin).  \nThus, Plaintiff MACTE is unlikely to establish standing. \nC.  Plaintiffs cannot piggyback on NADOHE’s analysis because NADOHE is not \nbinding and they are differently situated. \nEven though all of Plaintiffs’ grant terminations occurred before Judge Abelson issued his \norder in NADOHE, Plaintiffs seek to have that order apply to them retroactively.  Although Judge \nAbelson’s decision is due “substantial deference,” it is not retroactive nor is it binding on this \ncourt.  Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Allfirst Bank, 282 F. Supp. 2d 339, 351 (D. Md. 2003) (“Of \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 18 of 32\n \n \ncourse, no decision of a district court judge is technically binding on another district court judge, \neven within the same district.”).  The material differences between the instant Plaintiffs and those \nin NADOHE underscores the importance of analyzing the instant case out of the shadow of \nNADOHE.   First, Plaintiffs here allege no First Amendment violations.  Second, rather than \nfearing the threat of grant terminations for unknown reasons, the instant Plaintiffs have received \ndefinitive notices of grant termination with stated reasons.  Third, DOE’s decisions in this case \nwere based on the agency’s own determinations apart from the J20 order.  To the extent NADOHE \ncould apply to this case, the Court should decline to extend it. \n1.  NADOHE’s holding hinged on First Amendment violations but these \nPlaintiffs have no First Amendment claim. \nA First Amendment violation rested at the core of the NADOHE decision.  The specter of \nthis free speech infringement permeated every aspect of the Court’s decision in NADOHE, \nincluding its holding that the J20 and J21 EOs were likely void for vagueness under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Plaintiffs allege no such free speech violation here, so the Court should decline to \nfollow NADOHE. \nAlthough Judge Abelson found the J20 termination provision void for vagueness, he did \nso while holding the government to a “more stringent vagueness test” due to the plaintiffs’ alleged \nfree speech infringement.  NADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, at *16 (quoting Vill. of Hoffman Estates \nv. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982)).  As Judge Abelson acknowledged, \n“[t]he vagueness doctrine analysis is not uniform across all case types.”  NADOHE, 2025 WL \n573764, at *18.  On the contrary, he observed that courts would have “some tolerance for \nvagueness” in cases involving “government awards [of] ‘selective subsidies’” if it were not for the \nalleged impingement on free speech.  Id.  This chilling of free speech was also important in the \ncourt’s weighing of irreparable injury and public interest supporting an injunction.  Id. at *27–28.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 19 of 32\n \n \nThe instant Plaintiffs allege no chilling of their right to free speech.  Thus, the government \nshould receive the benefit of a vagueness analysis that has “some tolerance for vagueness.”  Id. at \n*18.  This important distinction cautions against applying NADOHE’s holding to this case. \n2.  NADOHE held that the likelihood of establishing vagueness stemmed \nfrom  uncertainty  regarding  grant  termination,  but  the  instant \nPlaintiffs have already had their grants terminated. \nNADOHE made two vagueness holdings using the “more stringent vagueness test” required \nin cases involving a First Amendment violation.  Id. at *16.  First, Judge Abelson found that the \ntermination provision was likely void because “the vagueness of the term ‘equity-related’ grants \nor contracts” invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Id. at *19.  Second, the Court held \nthat the same term “offers insufficient notice to current grantees about whether and how they can \nadapt their conduct to avoid termination of their grants or contracts.”  Id. at *20.  The fact that no \nNADOHE plaintiff had yet been notified of a grant termination was central to both holdings.  See, \ne.g., id. at *3 (acknowledging “Plaintiffs . . . are left to guess . . . whether their federal grants or \ncontracts will be terminated” (internal quotations omitted).  Neither of these vagueness holdings \nshould apply to the current Plaintiffs because DOE did terminate their grants.   \nAs to the differences in Judge Abelson’s analysis regarding arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement,4 NADOHE focused on the fears of plaintiffs facing uncertain enforcement.  See, e.g., \nid. at *3, *20.  In contrast, the instant case presents a more concrete question because Plaintiffs \nchallenge the termination of several discrete grants.  See generally, ECF 1.  Judge Abelson \nacknowledged that the termination provision of the J20 order could be vague as to some while \n \n \n4   This filing addresses the concern about the merits of Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement more fully in Section IV.E, below.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 20 of 32\n \n \ngiving other grantees “notice that their grants are subject to termination.”  NADOHE, 2025 WL \n573764, at *21.  Indeed, the District Court for the District of Columbia found that an agency action \nterminating grants for particularized reasons was distinct from a blanket termination in response \nto an executive order.  AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, __ F. Supp. 3d __, \n2025 WL 752378 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025).   \nSo too here, the Court’s analysis must focus on whether DOE’s termination of Plaintiffs’ \ngrants was vague or arbitrary as applied to them.  See Educ. Media Co. v. Insley, 731 F.3d 291, \n298 n.5 (4th Cir. 2013) (noting that as-applied challenges are “based on a developed factual record \nand the application of a statute to a specific person”).  Defendants argue it was not.  See Section \nIV.E, below.  Given the actual grant terminations here, NADOHE’s holding should not apply. \n3.  NADOHE challenged the potential enforcement of the J20 termination \nprovision, while the instant case challenges an actual agency decision \nnot definitively tied to the J20 termination provision. \nAlthough Plaintiffs assume DOE terminated their grants because of the J20 Executive \nOrder that NADOHE enjoined, DOE does not concede this and the documentary record indicates \nindependent agency review.  Judge Abelson held plaintiffs were likely to establish a direct \nconnection between their injuries and the J20 and J21 EOs because the plaintiffs received letters \nexplicitly tying potential grant termination to the EOs.  NADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, at *11.  Thus, \nJudge Abelson’s analysis of the constitutionality of the EOs more directly applied to the plaintiffs’ \nchallenge. \nBut no such direct communication link here.  Plaintiffs attached DOE’s communications \nterminating their grants, and each communication cited to applicable provisions of the Code of \nFederal Regulations (“CFR”) and more general changes in overarching “Department priorities.”  \nSee, e.g., ECF 5-8 at 23–24.  The letters cite to a determination by the “Acting Secretary of \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 21 of 32\n \n \nEducation” based on “constitutional and statutory law.”  Id. (going on to identify the constitutional \nand statutory authority).  Because NADOHE focuses on a facial challenge to the J20 and J21 EOs, \nand the instant case focuses on a series of discrete grant terminations stemming from an agency \naction, the Court should decline to extend NADOHE’s reasoning. \nIn sum, although Judge Abelson’s opinion in NADOHE deserves deference from this \nCourt, the decision is not binding and material differences between NADOHE and this case caution \nagainst extending it. \nD.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their vagueness claim. \nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment vagueness claim fails because their grant terminations were \nnot vague.  “A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it (1) fails to provide people of ordinary \nintelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or (2) authorizes or \neven encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  United States v. Saunders, 828 F.3d \n198, 206 (4th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  To assess fair notice, courts ask whether “the ordinary \nperson exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand” the language.  Id. (quoting \nUnited States v. Shrader, 675 F.3d 300, 310 (4th Cir. 2012)).  Courts also consider whether unclear \nlanguage may encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 451 (2019).  Because the grant terminations specified the reasons for the termination, \nand because both the complaint and the preliminary injunction motion identified the grant features \nthat fall under the “DEI” umbrella, the terminations were not vague.   \nWhere  a  Fifth  Amendment  challenge  involves  the  impact  of  economic  policies  to \norganizations and does not implicate a free speech concern, courts apply a relaxed vagueness test.  \nHoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 498 (holding that “economic regulation” is subject to “a less strict \nvagueness test” compared to criminal statutes, since “businesses, which face economic demands \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 22 of 32\n \n \nto plan behavior carefully, can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action”).  \nCompare id. at 499 (noting that “the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution \ndemands of a law is whether it . . . interferes with the right of free speech”) with ECF 1 (failing to \nraise  any  free  speech  claim).    Generally,  “[a]  civil  statute  .  .  .  that  does  not  implicate \nconstitutionally-protected conduct is not unconstitutional unless it is ‘impermissibly vague in all \nof its applications.’”  Havtech, LLC v. AAON Inc., No. CV SAG-22-00453, 2023 WL 200117, at \n*4 (D. Md. Jan. 17, 2023) (quoting Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 495). \nCourts are particularly generous when it comes to selective government subsidies, applying \na relaxed vagueness analysis to imprecise government priorities.  Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. \nFinley, 524 U.S. 569, 589 (1998).  See also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972) \n(“Condemned  to  the  use  of  words,  we  can  never  expect  mathematical  certainty  from  our \nlanguage.”).  For example, where challenged language does not provide definitions but the words \n“can be interpreted by people of common intelligence,” no additional definition is required.  \nHavtech, 2023 WL 200117, at *5 (internal quotation omitted).  See also Finley, 524 U.S. at 589 \n(noting that scholarships and grants awarded for “subjective criteria such as ‘excellence’” are \nselective subsidies not void for vagueness).  Moreover, where challenged language may have \ndiffering definitions but there is no real dispute for the existing plaintiffs of the language’s \napplication, the language is not vague.  See Wilson v. PL Phase One Operations L.P., 422 F. Supp. \n3d 971, 983 (D. Md. 2019). \nHere, DOE provided grant termination letters that specified the reasons for each grant \ntermination.  The letters explain that DOE grants will no longer support “diversity, equity, and \ninclusion (“DEI”) initiatives.”  See, e.g., ECF 1-2 at 8 (noting that DOE will not fund any other \nforms of unlawful discrimination, either).  The letters also note that the terminated grant programs \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 23 of 32\n \n \n“take part in DEI initiatives” or other forms of unlawful discrimination.  Id.  The letters also cite \nto the specific sections of the CFR that allow DOE to terminate grants due to changes in \n“Department priorities.”  Id. (referencing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.339-43).  Although Plaintiffs complain that they were not “put . . . on notice for the \nreason for the grant termination,” this is not genuine given the letters’ explanations.  ECF 5-1 n.10.   \nMoreover, any claim that the terms “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion” are vague is \nbelied by the fact that not only did Plaintiffs use these very words in naming their grant projects \nand  describing  their  programs,  but  these  terms  also  appeared  in  the  solicitation  for  grant \napplications DOE published in the Federal Register when Plaintiffs applied for their grant funding.  \nSee, e.g., ECF 1 at ¶¶ 79, 81, 101 (describing terminated grants as involving diversity, equity, and \ninclusion); 89 F.R. 23573 (TQP application notice, which includes the words diversity, equity, and \ninclusion); 87 F.R. 19487-01 (same for the SEED application notice); 88 F.R. 33592 (same for the \nTSL notice).  Plaintiffs also identified these program components in their complaint, suggesting \ntheir awareness of the reasons for their grant termination.  In other words, Plaintiffs knew what \nthese terms meant when they applied for funding and when they filed the instant complaint, so it \nis a fair inference that they also knew what they meant when they read the termination letters.  \nThese terms are not vague, especially under the more relaxed standard applicable to selective \nfunding decisions like government grants. \nE.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their APA claim because enacting a new \nadministration’s priorities, consistent with federal law, is not arbitrary or \ncapricious. \nPlaintiffs’ APA claim is also unavailing.  Plaintiffs’ singular point in support of their \narbitrary and capricious argument is that DOE acted “contrary to the law” by failing to publish any \nchange in “Department priorities” in the Federal Register with a “notice and comment” period.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 24 of 32\n \n \nECF 5-1 at 27.  They do not clearly allege any other procedural irregularities establishing arbitrary \nand capricious agency action.56  This one argument cannot carry the day because there is no \nrequirement  that  big-picture  Department  priorities  follow  the  same  public  rulemaking  and \ncommenting process as priorities for grant awards.  \n“Arbitrary and capricious” is a “narrow” standard of review in which DOE’s action is \npresumed valid.  Marsh v. Oregon Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989) (narrow standard); \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 16 F.3d 1395, 1400 (4th Cir. 1993) (presumed \nvalidity).  The Court merely “consider[s] whether the agency considered the relevant factors and \nwhether a clear error of judgment was made.”  Hoffler v. Mattis, 677 Fed. Appx. 119, 120 (4th Cir. \n2017) (quoting Ohio Valley Envtl. Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177, 192 (4th Cir. 2009)).  \nIn other words, courts ask if “the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in \nparticular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.”  \nFed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  The APA is not \na mechanism for judicial policy revision, because “courts lack authority ‘to impose upon [an] \nagency its own notion of which procedures are ‘best’ or most likely to further some vague, \nundefined public good.’”  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 102 (2015) (cleaned up) \n \n \n5   It is unclear whether Plaintiffs allege that placement on “route pay” constitutes arbitrary \nand capricious agency action.  Although their filings reference the route pay condition, the \nargument is not fleshed out in their motion.   \n \n6   Of note, the plaintiffs in California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ. appear to have advanced different \nAPA arguments in support of their TRO motion not offered by Plaintiffs in the instant case.  See \nOrder,  1:25-cv-10548-MJJ,  ECF  No.  41  (D.  Mass.  Mar.  6,  2025)  (referencing  lack  of \n“individualized analysis of any of the programs” in termination letters). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 25 of 32\n \n \n(quoting Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 549 \n(1978)). \nFederal regulations explicitly allow agencies to terminate grants for no other reason besides \n“an award no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340.  This language came \nfrom Office of Management and Budget (OMB) changes to Uniform Guidance in the year 2020.  \nGuidance for Grants and Agreements, Published Doc. No. 2020-17468, 85 FR 49506 (Aug. 13, \n2020), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/13/2020-17468/guidance-\nfor-grants-and-agreements (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  The comments to this change to the \nUniform Guidance note that the language is meant to allow “awarding agencies [to] prioritize \nongoing support to Federal awards that meet program goals” and “terminate the Federal award” \nwhere it does not.  Id. \nPlaintiffs argue that “Department priorities” may only change if subjected to a notice and \ncomment period pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d) and 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2).  ECF 5-1 at 22–\n23.  These provisions do not support Plaintiffs’ argument.  § 1232(d) governs regulations and § \n75.105(b)(2) governs annual priorities.  Neither of these regulations relate to the big-picture \ndepartmental  priorities  that  changed  with  the  new  Presidential  administration,  and  neither \nundermines the ability of a federal agency to terminate an award for no longer aligning with agency \npriorities.  Rather, the regulations distinguish between “annual absolute, competitive preference, \nand invitational priorities,” as identified and described in 34 C.F.R. § 75.105, and general Agency \nor Administrative priorities, as referred to in 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).   The fact that two different \nregulations from two different chapters of the CFR address the different types of priorities \nunderscores the distinction between them.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 26 of 32\n \n \n“Annual absolute, competitive preference, and invitational priorities” are specific priorities \nestablished by the Secretary of Education which are utilized in Agency grant programs.  See 34 \nC.F.R. § 75.105.  Per 34 C.F.R. § 75.105, such priorities are used for selection of applications for \nAgency programs.  Annual absolute, competitive preference, and invitational priorities are subject \nto a notice and comment period and rulemaking, unless an exemption applies.  Id.  Unlike these \nspecific  annual  absolute,  competitive  preference,  and  invitational  priorities,  Agency  or \nAdministration priorities are general and issued at the discretion of the Agency or Administration.  \nAgency and Administration priorities stem from an Agency or Administration’s mission and \nagenda and can be changed at any time without a vote or notice and comment from the public.  \nPlaintiff’s interpretation of federal regulation renders every federal agency powerless to shift its \nactivities with new Presidential administrations absent a lengthy public rulemaking process.  There \nis no authority for the proposition that agencies must go through this process any time they change \ntheir overarching policies or goals. \nIt is true that an agency’s ability to terminate funding pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 is \nrelatively untested and there is a paucity of caselaw interpreting the provision.  An Ohio State Law \nJournal article considered 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 and acknowledged that, before President Trump’s \nfirst administration, “[t]erminating multiyear grants simply because of a claimed change in priority \nwas . . . unheard of” and “clearly illegal.”  Eloise Pasachoff, Executive Branch Control of Federal \nGrants: Policy, Pork, and Punishment, 83 Ohio St. L.J. 1113, 1184 (2022).  The current § 200.340 \nlanguage allowing unilateral termination of a federal grant award “if [it] no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities” only appeared in 2020 towards the end of President Trump’s \nfirst term and did not see much use during the Biden administration.  Id.  But the language makes \nsuch a funding termination consistent with federal regulations.  While Ms. Pasachoff’s article \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 27 of 32\n \n \nacknowledges the “troublesome” implications of this change, including “fuel[ing] autocracy,” she \nalso acknowledges that the plain language of the regulation allows an agency, consistently with \nthe law, to terminate grant funding “because the President or other senior political officials say \nso.”  Id. \nBecause Plaintiffs’  “arbitrary and  capricious” argument is likely to fail, preliminary \ninjunction is further unwarranted. \nF.  Two of the final three preliminary injunction factors – balance of equities and \npublic interest – weigh in favor of the Government. \nIn addition to proving likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs must also show \nirreparable harm and that the balance of equities and public interest weigh in their favor.  For the \npurposes of this motion only, Defendants do not contest that Plaintiffs can establish irreparable \nharm.  However, the final two factors weigh in the government’s favor and compel denial of \nPlaintiffs’ motion. \nThe balance of the equities and the public interest “merge when the Government is the \nopposing party.”  Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 365 (4th Cir. 2022) (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. \nat 435).  To balance the equities, the Court considers “the relative harms to applicant and \nrespondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.”  Barnes v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. \n& Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (quoting Rostker v. \nGoldberg, 448 U.S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in chambers)).  Irreparable harm to Plaintiffs \nis not decisive.  See Ass’n of Jewish Camp Operators v. Cuomo, 470 F. Supp. 3d 197, 228–29 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding irreparable harm to Plaintiffs from closure of overnight camps, but still \nfinding important governmental interest weighed against preliminary injunction). \nWhile Plaintiffs’ Complaint and motion lay out the public interest in favor of an injunction, \nthere are several compelling interests that weigh against an injunction.  First, the government and \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 28 of 32\n \n \nthe public both have a compelling interest in ending discrimination.  In 2023, the Supreme Court \nrecognized  that  educational  policies  or  programs  favoring  one  race  –  even  a  historically \ndisadvantaged race – were not equitable but instead were discriminatory.  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 206.  \nDOE must be allowed to act upon this binding interpretation of federal civil rights laws by ending \nits support for programs that show preferences based on protected class.   \nSecond, although many Americans support diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, many \nothers view DEI policies as a scourge, “creating new prejudices and allowing old ones to fester,” \ncausing some to “resent members of what they perceive to be favored races, believing that the \nsuccesses of those individuals are unearned.”  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 275–76 (Thomas, J., concurring).  \nThe public interest in ending DEI must be weighed against the preference of those who wish to \nkeep it. \nFinally, the Court is charged with protecting all Americans, which requires the Court to \nweigh the interest of more than seventy-seven million people who voted for President Trump in \nthe 2024 Presidential election.  These Americans voted for a President who openly and fervently \ncampaigned on the promise to end diversity, equity, and inclusion in all its forms.  See, e.g., Alexis \nAgathocleous et al., Trump on DEI and Anti-Discrimination Law, ACLU.org, at 2 (Jul. 2, 2024), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/publications/trump-on-dei-and-anti-discrimination-law (“The 2024 Trump \ncampaign . . . has promised . . . to eradicate both public and private diversity, equity, and inclusion \n(DEI) policies); id.

The war on ‘woke’ America \nhas  a  new  commander-in-chief,  USAtoday.com  (Nov.  22,  2024), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/22/rip-dei-donald-trump-\npresident/76116276007/ (“On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promoted the idea that white \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 29 of 32\n \n \nAmericans were targets of racism and made reversing Joe Biden’s ‘woke takeover’ of Washington \na priority of his second term in office. . . .

The President’s DEI agenda was no secret. \nWhile it may be an understatement to say that not everyone agrees with President Trump’s \nviews on DEI, his voters have a significant public interest in ending DEI as quickly as possible.  \nSee, e.g., Eliza Collins & Elizabeth Findell, The Minority Voters Who Love Trump’s Dismantling \nof DEI, MSN.com (Feb. 9, 2025), https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/the-minority-voters-\nwho-love-trump-s-dismantling-of-dei/ar-AA1yGJ0B  (originally  published  in  the  Wall  Street \nJournal) (quoting Latino man as saying, “I’m very happy that DEI is hopefully going to disappear \nstarting from the government and hopefully it’ll catch on”) [hereafter, “Minority Voters”]; Ingrid \nJacques, Trump is waging war against DEI in schools.

A balance of equities and \nthe public interest also must factor in the plurality of the country who have a substantial interest in \nensuring that millions in federal grant money is not forever lost to these terminated grant programs. \nG.  To the extent the Court is inclined to grant a preliminary injunction, it should \ninstead remand to DOE for further development of the record. \nDue to the expedited preliminary injunction briefing schedule, there was not sufficient time \nto assemble a thorough evidentiary record to show that DOE’s grant terminations were not based \non the J20 and J21 EOs, were consistent with federal civil rights law, and were based on \nparticularized issues with each program.   \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 24     Filed 03/11/25     Page 30 of 32\n \n \nTo  the  extent  the  Court  considers  granting  a  preliminary  injunction,  Defendants \nrespectfully request the Court instead remand the matter back to DOE to provide a more detailed \nexplanation for each grant termination on an expedited schedule.7  Armed with a more grant-\nspecific explanation, Plaintiffs could then determine whether they still wish to pursue legal action \nand the Court could then reconsider the matter with a more fulsome record.  Courts allowed for \nsimilar remands in Prometheus and AIDS.  See, e.g., Prometheus, 592 U.S. at 422; AIDS, 2025 \nWL 752378, at *13.   \nMoreover, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that imposition of route pay was arbitrary and \ncapricious – an argument referenced in the complaint but not fully fleshed out in their motion – \nDOE can also resolve any lack of specificity and notice on remand. \nH.  If the Court grants a preliminary injunction, its scope should be limited only \nto the cancelled grants identified in Plaintiffs’ motion. \nTo the extent the Court decides a preliminary injunction is appropriate, the Court should \nlimit relief only to the cancelled grants specifically identified in the complaint and motion for \npreliminary injunction.  “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and \njudgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal \nissues it presents.”  Trump v.

Civil No.: 1:25-cv-00702-JRR \n \nLINDA MCMAHON, in her official  \ncapacity as Secretary of Education, et al., \n   \nDefendants. \n \nORDER \n  The court has before it Plaintiffs’ Rule 60(b) Motion to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction \nand Request for Indicative Ruling Under Rule 62.1 (ECF No. 52; the “Motion”) and the parties’ \nJoint Notice at ECF No. 55 in which the parties advise that Defendants “do not oppose” Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief.  The court convened an on-record conference on May 5, 2025, to discuss generally \nthe Motion and how dissolution of the preliminary injunction entered at ECF No. 33 (the “PI”) \nwould affect the case. \n  As shared with the parties at the conference, the court struggles to see a substantive or \nprocedural advantage to the progress of this action, judicial economy, or the respective (or shared) \ninterests of the parties if the court were to dissolve the PI.  By way of background, on April 10, \n2025, the Fourth Circuit granted Defendants’ motion to stay the PI pending appeal (ECF No. 50) \nin view of Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. --- , 145 S. Ct. 996 (2025), in which \nthe Supreme Court – on consideration of the Government’s request for immediate administrative \nstay of a similar injunction entered by the District of Massachusetts – found the “Government is \nlikely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction . . . under the APA” based on \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 58     Filed 05/06/25     Page 2 of 2\napplication of the Tucker Act.  145 S. Ct. at 968.  Before the Supreme Court considered the \nrequested stay in California, this court had already issued an opinion (ECF No. 42) that the Tucker \nAct does not divest this court of subject matter jurisdiction – based on long-standing Supreme \nCourt and other precedent.   \n  Defendants are candid that they will file a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction should this court grant the Motion and the action be remanded for \ndissolution of the PI.  Regardless, even if Defendants did not file such a motion, the court would \nbe obliged to raise the issue sua sponte in view of the Supreme Court’s evaluation of the \n“likelihood” that the Tucker Act applies in California – this case’s doppelganger.  Given that the \nFourth Circuit already has before it this precise issue, the court concludes there is simply no gain \nto be had by issuing the requested indicative ruling (and subsequently dissolving the PI on remand).   \nTherefore, the Motion (ECF No. 52) shall be, and is hereby, DENIED. \n \n                /S/ \n     \nMay 6, 2025            Julie R.

Civil No.: 1:25-cv-00702-JRR \n \nLINDA MCMAHON, in her official  \ncapacity as Secretary of Education, et al., \n   \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER1 \n  This matter comes before the court on Defendants Linda McMahon, in her official capacity \nas Secretary of Education, U.S. Department of Education, and Donald J. Trump’s, in his official \ncapacity as President of the United States, Emergency Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 36; \nthe “Motion.”)  The court has reviewed all papers.  No hearing is necessary and none has been \nrequested.  Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023).    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs discussed at length in its memorandum opinion issued Monday, March 17, 2025, \nPlaintiffs AACTE, NCTR, and MACTE initiated this action on March 5, 2025, asserting two \nclaims: violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Count I) and violation of the \nAPA (Count II).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the Department’s termination of grants \nawarded through the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Programs.  Following briefing and a hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.  (ECF Nos. 32, 33.)  Specifically, the court held that Plaintiffs demonstrated a clear \n \n1 All terms defined in the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. 32 shall have the same meanings here.   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 2 of 13\nlikelihood of success on the APA claim and issued a preliminary injunction that, inter alia, requires \nDefendants to reinstate TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards of Plaintiff NCTR and Plaintiffs’ \nmembers, and enjoins Defendants from terminating TQP, SEED, or TSL awards in a manner the \ncourt  found  likely  in  violation  of  the  APA.    Id.    Defendants  are  required  to  reinstate  the \naforementioned TQP, SEED, and TSL awards within five business days of the court’s order.  (ECF \nNo. 33.)   \n  At 7:53 p.m. on March 18, 2025, Defendants filed their emergency Motion, requesting the \ncourt rule on the Motion within 24 hours.  (ECF No. 36.)  That same evening, the court ordered \nPlaintiff to respond by 12:00 p.m. today, March 19, 2025.  (ECF No. 37.)  Plaintiffs met that \ndeadline with 8 minutes to spare (ECF No. 38), following which Defendants filed a reply at 2:11 \np.m. today (ECF No. 40).  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) \nDefendants bring this Motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).  (ECF \nNo. 26-1 at p. 2.)  Rule 54(b) “governs reconsideration of orders that do not constitute final \njudgments in a case (i.e., interlocutory orders).”  Carrero v. Farrelly, 310 F. Supp. 3d 581, 583–\n84 (D. Md. 2018).  Rule 54(b) provides that “any order or other decision . . . that adjudicates fewer \nthan all the claims . . . may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all \nthe claims.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 54(b).  “Compared to motions to reconsider final judgments pursuant \nto Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 54(b)’s approach involves broader \nflexibility to revise interlocutory orders before final judgment as the litigation develops and new \nfacts or arguments come to light.”  U.S. Tobacco Coop. Inc. v. Big S. Wholesale of Virginia, LLC, \n899 F.3d 236, 257 (4th Cir. 2018) (emphasis in original) (citing Carlson v. Boston Sci. Corp., 856 \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 3 of 13\nF.3d 320, 325 (4th Cir. 2017)).  Resolution of a motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory \norder “is committed to the discretion of the district court.”  Am. Canoe Ass’n v. Murphy Farms, \nInc., 326 F.3d 505, 515 (4th Cir. 2003).  Importantly, “the discretion afforded by Rule 54(b) is not \nlimitless;” the Fourth Circuit has “cabined revision pursuant to Rule 54(b) by treating interlocutory \nrulings as law of the case.”  U.S. Tobacco Coop. Inc., 899 F.3d at 256–57.  Accordingly, a court \nmay revise an interlocutory order to account for “(1) a subsequent trial producing substantially \ndifferent evidence; (2) a change in applicable law; or (3) clear error causing manifest injustice.” \nId. at 257 (quoting Carlson, 856 F.3d at 325).    \nB.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)2 \n“Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.”  Barnett v. United States, 193 F. Supp. 3d 515, 518 (D. Md. 2016).  \n“The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of \nthe evidence.”  United States ex rel. Fadlalla v. DynCorp Int’l LLC, 402 F. Supp. 3d 162, 176 (D. \nMd. 2019) (citing Lovern v. Edwards, 190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 1999)).  “In determining whether \njurisdiction exists, ‘the court may look beyond the pleadings and the jurisdictional allegations of \nthe complaint and view whatever evidence has been submitted on the issue.’”  Id. at 176 (quoting \nKhoury v. Meserve, 268 F. Supp. 2d 600, 606 (D. Md. 2003)).  \nSubject matter jurisdiction challenges may proceed in two ways: “either a facial challenge, \nasserting that the allegations pleaded in the complaint are insufficient to establish subject matter \njurisdiction, or a factual challenge, asserting ‘that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint \n[are] not true.’” Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Trump, 416 F. Supp. 3d 452, 479 (D. Md. \n2019) (quoting Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009)).  Defendants here mount \n \n2 Defendants at once title their Motion as one “for Reconsideration” per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and \nseek dismissal of the Complaint per Rule 12(b)(1).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 4 of 13\na facial challenge to this court’s exercise of jurisdiction.  In a facial challenge, “the facts alleged \nin the complaint are taken as true, and the motion must be denied if the complaint alleges sufficient \nfacts to invoke subject matter jurisdiction.”  Kerns, 585 F.3d at 192; see Ministry of Defence of \nState of Kuwait v. Naffa, 105 F.4th 154, 159 (4th Cir. 2024) (same). \nInasmuch as subject matter jurisdiction is unwaivable and may be raised at any time by any \nparty, including by the court sua sponte, the court dispenses with discussion of Rule 54 and moves \nto the heart of the matter.   \nIII.  ANALYSIS  \nDefendants now advance two arguments, both jurisdictional in nature, and neither of which \nwas raised in their briefing or oral argument on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.   \nFirst, Defendants argue the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the United States \nCourt of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over this action in accordance with the Tucker \nAct.  Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Department’s final agency \naction—termination of the Grant Program Awards by the Termination Letter—was a matter \ncommitted to agency discretion and, as such, is beyond the grasp of judicial review.   \nA.  Tucker Act – 28 U.S.C. § 1491 \n“The Tucker Act grants jurisdiction to the United States Court of Federal Claims ‘to render \njudgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any \nAct of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, . . . or for liquidated or unliquidated \ndamages in cases not sounding in tort.’”  Randall v. United States, 95 F.3d 339, 346 (4th Cir. 1996) \n(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491).  “Jurisdiction is exclusive in the Court of Federal Claims for claims \nover $10,000, while district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Federal Claims \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 5 of 13\nfor claims at or under $10,000.”  Coleman v. Kendall, 74 F.4th 610, 615 (4th Cir. 2023), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 818 (2024) (citing Randall, 95 F.3d at 347).  \nWhile not novel, Massachusetts v. Nat’l Institutes of Health, 25-cv-10338, 2025 WL \n702163, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), “[t]he interplay between the Tucker Act and the APA is \nsomewhat complicated and raises some significant issues of federal court jurisdiction.”  Randall, \n95 F.3d at 346.  “The APA allows private parties to sue the federal government in district court \nover final agency actions, so long as they seek relief other than monetary damages ‘for which there \nis no other adequate remedy in a court.’”  Coleman, 74 F.4th at 615 (quoting Randall, 95 F.3d at \n346).  “Claims for money, by contrast, proceed under the Tucker Act and in the Court of Federal \nClaims.”  Williams v. Roth, No. 8:21-CV-02135-PX, 2022 WL 4134316, at *5 (D. Md. Sept. 12, \n2022) (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(a)(2), 1491).   To that end, “where ‘a plaintiff has an adequate \nremedy by suit under the Tucker Act,’ they are precluded from review under the APA.”  Coleman, \n74 F.4th at 615 (quoting Randall, 95 F.3d at 346); see also Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United \nStates, 590 U.S. 296, 324 (2020) (noting the flip side of the same coin: “[t]he Tucker Act yields \nwhen the . . . Administrative Procedure Act [] provides an avenue for relief”).  \n“There is a ‘distinction between an action at law for damages,’ which provides monetary \ncompensation, and ‘an equitable action for specific relief,’ which might nonetheless require \nmonetary  relief.”    Massachusetts,  2025  WL  702163,  at  *7  (first  quoting  Bowen  v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988); and then citing Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. \nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204, 213 (2002) (explaining “whether [restitution] is legal or equitable depends \n‘on the basis for [the plaintiff’s] claim’ and the nature of the underlying remedies sought” (citations \nomitted)).  “To determine whether a plaintiff seeks primarily injunctive relief such that a district \ncourt has jurisdiction over his claim, courts must look to the ‘essence’ of the complaint and whether \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 6 of 13\nthe relief requested is ‘not . . . an incident of, or collateral to, a monetary award.’”  Coleman, 74 \nF.4th at 615–16 (quoting Randall, 95 F.3d at 346).   \n“The classification of a particular action as one which is or is not ‘at its essence’ a contract \naction depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon \nthe type of relief sought (or appropriate).”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1982).  “Courts must read the Complaint with an eye toward ‘the true nature of the action’ to \nascertain whether it is, in fact, seeking money damages or some other relief.”  Williams v. Roth, \nNo. 8:21-CV-02135-PX, 2022 WL 4134316, at *5 (D. Md. Sept. 12, 2022) (quoting James v. \nCaldera, 159 F.3d 573, 579 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).  Importantly, “a suit which does not seek monetary \ndamages does not arise under the Tucker Act simply because the plaintiff’s success will result in \neventual monetary gain from the government.”  Harrison v. Kendall, 670 F. Supp. 3d 280, 297 \n(E.D. Va. 2023) (quoting Powe v. Sec’y of Navy, 35 F.3d 556, at *2 (4th Cir. 1994) (unpublished \ntable decision)); see Roetenberg v. Sec’y of Air Force, 73 F. Supp. 2d 631, 636 (E.D. Va. 1999) \n(explaining that “[i]t is settled that where . . . the essence of a claim is the equitable relief sought, \nand any financial ramifications of a favorable decision are subordinate to the equitable relief, the \nCourt of Federal Claims does not have exclusive jurisdiction over that claim” (emphasis in \noriginal)). “The fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a \nsufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893.   \n“A hallmark of such equitable actions is the existence of prospective relief in ongoing \nrelationships.”  Massachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, at *7 (citing Bowen, 487 U.S. at 905).  “An \nadjudication of the lawfulness of [an agency’s] regulatory interpretation will have future impact \non the ongoing relationship between the parties.  The Court of Federal Claims cannot provide this \nrelief.”  Katz v. Cisneros, 16 F.3d 1204, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  In contrast, a suit properly proceeds \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 7 of 13\nin the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act where plaintiffs “seek not prospective, \nnonmonetary relief to clarify future obligations but specific sums already calculated, past due, and \ndesigned to compensate for completed labors.”  Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 \nU.S. 296, 298 (2020).  Indeed, it is generally understood that the Court of Federal Claims “has no \npower to grant equitable relief.”  Richardson v. Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465 (1973).  The Tucker \nAct, however, allows for narrow exception to empower the Court of Federal Claims to provide \ninjunctive relief only when such relief is necessary to provide an entire remedy and when the \ninjunction is “an incident of and collateral to” an award of monetary relief.  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2).  \nIn Bowen, the Supreme Court considered whether a district court had subject matter \njurisdiction over the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ request for judicial review of the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services’ Medicaid disallowance decision; and to order the Secretary to pay \nthe state the monies it asserted had been wrongfully disallowed (not reimbursed). Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. at 882.  The Court concluded: “since the orders are for specific relief \n(they undo the Secretary’s refusal to reimburse the State) rather than for money damages (they do \nnot provide relief that substitutes for that which ought to have been done) they are within the \nDistrict Court’s jurisdiction under § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity.”  Id. at 910.   \nBowen sets forth a thorough explication – relying with favor on Judge Bork’s analysis in \nMaryland Dept. of Health Resources v. Dept. of Health and Human Svc., 763 F.2d 1441 (D.C. Cir. \n1985) – of the critical distinction between “money damages” and “monetary relief.”  487 U.S. at \n894–96.  In sum, the Court explains that while money damages is always a form of monetary relief, \nnot all monetary relief is money damages.  And an action to enforce a statute (there, the Medicaid \nAct), “which happens to be one for the payment of money” does not render it subject to the Tucker \nAct.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 900.  “The fact that the mandate is one for the payment of money must \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 8 of 13\nnot be confused with the question whether such payment, in these circumstances, is a payment of \nmoney as damages or as specific relief.”  Id. at 900-901. \nIn California v. U.S. Department of Education, Judge Joun concluded in favor of the \ndistrict court’s subject matter jurisdiction on a Tucker Act challenge.  He concluded that the \nplaintiffs (several states) “seek equitable relief in the form of reinstatement of the TQP and SEED \ngrants.  Plaintiff States also seek to enjoin Defendants from implementing, giving effect to, \nmaintaining or reinstating under a different name the termination of any previous awarded TQP \nand SEED grants. In other words, Plaintiff States seek to preserve the previous status quo to \nalleviate corresponding harm; they are not alleging claims for past pecuniary harms.”  California \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825,  at *1 (D. \nMass. Mar. 10, 2025) (citing Massachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, where Judge Angel Kelley found \nthe essence of the plaintiffs’ claims was not contractual in nature because “Plaintiffs do not bring \nclaims for past pecuniary harms.  Rather, like petitioners in Bowen, their claims are to preserve \ntheir ongoing and prospective agreements with [the agency]”)); see also Aids Vaccine Advoc. Coal. \nv. United States Dep’t of State, — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-00400 (AHA), 2025 WL 752378, \nat *9 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) (finding that “Plaintiffs do not seek money damages and, . . . do not \nseek the contractual remedy of ‘money in compensation for [their losses], whatever they may be,’ \nin relation to any breach of their agreements . . . .  Indeed, it would be quite extraordinary to \nconsider Plaintiffs’ claims to sound in breach of contract when they do not at all depend on whether \nthe terms of particular awards were breached—they instead challenge whether the agency action \nhere was unlawful, irrespective of any breach”).   \nOn review of the caselaw, controlling and persuasive alike, whether the Tucker Act \ncontrols (i.e., divests a district court of jurisdiction) is fact-specific and requires analysis tailored \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 9 of 13\nto the particular facets of the claims before the court.  The court must consider: 1) the beating heart \nof the plaintiff’s complaint; and 2) what relief will render the plaintiff whole if the complaint has \nmerit. \nHere, the court concludes that the Tucker Act does not apply and this court has subject \nmatter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims for the following chief reasons:  \n1.  Plaintiffs do not seek money damages for past wrongs.  Plaintiffs come to court \nseeking redress for alleged statutory and regulatory violations that, if left unchecked, will have \nimmediate, lasting and irreparable harm of an existential nature to their programs, and resultant \ngrave harm to the communities they serve.  Plaintiffs’ seek reinstatement of their status as Grant \nProgram awardees so they can resume and sustain the capacity to run their education-related \nprogramming across the nation; that the court’s order for reinstatement effects the Department’s \npurse does not render this a contract claim for money damages.  That is not its essence; \n2.  In addition to reinstatement, Plaintiffs seek forward-looking equitable relief to \nprevent Defendants from terminating other Grant Program awards in the manner about which they \ncomplain and for which they requested preliminary injunctive relief.  The Court of Federal Claims \nlacks the authority to afford the complete equitable relief Plaintiffs seek; \n3.  The  narrow  circumstances  in  which  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  may  issue \ninjunctive relief per the Tucker Act do not exist here, which is to say, equitable relief is not incident \nof, or collateral to, an award of money damages. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2);  \n4.  In addition to restoration of their Grant Program status, Plaintiffs demand the court \norder Defendants to remove “route pay grant conditions” (requiring pre-approval to access grant \nfunds), which Plaintiffs allege Defendants unlawfully put in place.  Here, again, Plaintiffs seek \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 10 of 13\nforward-looking equitable relief to remove what they allege are unlawful roadblocks to their \nprogramming.  The Court of Federal Claims lacks the authority to provide this relief; and  \n5.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint requires the court to review and make findings regarding the \nparties’  relationship  pursuant  to  a  constellation  of  sources:  the  Grant  Programs’  respective \nauthorizing statutes, the Departments regulations to implement those statutes; and GEPA.  This, \nalone, removes this action from the Tucker Act’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of \nFederal Claims.    \nThe cases Defendants cite in their reply are unavailing.  Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United \nStates, for example, involves a private government contractor who contracted to provide data \nprocessing services and equipment to the General Services Administration.  764 F.2d 891 (1985).  \nWhen the plaintiff failed to provide deliverables, GSA invoked the liquidated damages provision \nof the contract and withheld payment on outstanding invoices.  The contractor sued, claiming GSA \nviolated the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3701, et seq.); the district court dismissed the action \non the basis that (per the Tucker Act), it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Federal \nClaims had exclusive jurisdiction.  Id.  Nothing about that case resembles the instant action.   \nIn Thermalon Indus. v. United States, 34 Fed. Cl. 411 (1995), the plaintiff sued the United \nStates in the Court of Federal Claims for breach of contract claiming the government (the National \nScience Foundation) wrongfully withheld payment for work done under a research grant.  The \ngovernment  argued  the  district  court  had  exclusive  jurisdiction  because  the  grant  was  “an \nagreement intended to effectuate the sovereign obligations of the United States and that all such \nagreements necessarily fall outside the scope of . . .  the Tucker Act.”  Id. at 413.  The Court of \nFederal Claims rejected that argument because the authorizing statute (the National Science \nFoundation Act of 1950, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1861, et seq.) specifically empowered the National Science \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 11 of 13\nFoundation to enter “contracts or other arrangements” to promote the sciences.   There, the plaintiff \nsought money damages for unpaid invoices for work completed per the grant contract.  Nothing \nabout that the court’s determination, as Defendants note in their reply, that a grant can fill the \nessential elements of a contract is remarkable; nor is the court’s ruling that Thermalon brought a \nstandard issue breach of contract action against the United States for non-payment of services.  \nAgain, as said above, Plaintiffs here do not seek an award of money damages for work performed \nor to compensate for a wrong.   \nB.  Judicial Review  \nDefendants also seek reconsideration of the court’s preliminary injunction on the basis that \nthe challenged agency action at issue here—termination of the Grant Awards on the basis of \nagency priorities—is “committed to agency discretion by law” and falls outside the scope of \npermissible judicial review under the APA.  (ECF No. 36-2 at p. 7.)  See 5 U.S.C. § 702(a)(2).   \nThe APA provides “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely \naffected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to \njudicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “That language sets up a ‘basic presumption of judicial \nreview’ of agency action.”  Holbrook v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 48 F.4th 282, 287 (4th Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Abbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967)).  The text carves out two exceptions \nto that “basic principle.”  Id.  First, where “statutes preclude judicial review” per § 701(a)(1); and \nsecond,  where  “agency  action  is  committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law”  per  §  701(a)(2).  \nHolbrook, 48 F.4th at 287. With regard to the second, “[a]gency action is committed to the \nagency’s discretion when no judicially manageable standards are available to assess how and when \nan agency should exercise its discretion such that a court would have ‘no law to apply.’”  Pharm. \nCoal. for Patient Access v. United States, 126 F.4th 947, 964 (4th Cir. 2025) (quoting Heckler v. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 12 of 13\nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830–31 (1985)).  Of import here, the APA’s prohibition of judicial review \nof actions committed to agency discretion by law, and a defect related thereto, “goes to subject \nmatter jurisdiction.”  Id. (citing Angelex Ltd. v. United States, 723 F.3d 500, 505–506 (4th Cir. \n2013)). \nDefendants’ argument relies exclusively on the Supreme Court’s opinion in Lincoln v. \nVigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993).  (ECF No. 36-1 at p. 7–8.)  Lincoln is materially distinguishable from \nthe facts here.  In Lincoln, the Court’s decision concerned the Indian Health Service’s decision to \nreallocate resources from the Indian Children’s Program to a “nationwide effort to assist” children \npreviously served by the Indian Children’s Program.  508 U.S. at 184.  The Court held that the \nIndian Health Service’s “decision to discontinue the Program was ‘committed to agency discretion \nby law’ and therefore not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2), and that the Service’s exercise of that discretion was not subject to the notice-\nand-comment rulemaking requirements imposed by § 553.”  Id.   \nRelevant here, the Indian Health Service, per the Snyder Act, 25 U.S.C. § 13, and the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1601, et seq., received an annual appropriation from \nCongress.  Neither the Snyder Act nor the Indian Health Care Improvement Act expressly \nreferenced the Indian Children’s Program or any other potential recipient/beneficiary other than \ngeneral reference to “Indian health.”  508 U.S. at 194.  By virtue of that omission, Congress, the \nCourt held, left it to the sound discretion of the Indian Health Service how to spend or use the \nappropriated funds.  Id. at 185.  The Indian Children’s Program, thus, had no continuing legal \nentitlement to same, and “[t]he allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is another \nadministrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.”  Id. at 192.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 42     Filed 03/19/25     Page 13 of 13\nImportantly, the Indian Health Service’s termination of the Indian Children’s Program was \nexempt from § 533 notice and comment rule making based on § 553(b)(A)’s exemption of “rules \nof agency rulemaking” from same.  Id. at 197.  Here, per the intersection of GEPA and the APA, \nassessed at length in the court’s memorandum opinion issued earlier this week, the Department’s \n“agency priorities” vis-à-vis the Grant Programs (and Plaintiffs’ members’ Grant Awards) are \nsquarely within the APA’s notice and comment rule making requirement and, therefore, are not \ncorrectly categorized as items within “agency discretion” not subject to judicial review.   \nOutside of Lincoln, Defendants offer no substantive argument or authority to support their \nassertion that the Department’s termination of the Grant Awards at issue here was “committed to \nagency discretion by law” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  The court will not \nundertake a prolix analysis where virtually none has been offered by movants, especially as \nDefendants request a ruling within 24 hours of their emergency Motion.  The court is satisfied \nbased upon the record before it that the APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” has been \nneither rebutted nor overcome.  See Holbrook, 48 F.4th at 287 and Abbott Lab’ys, 387 U.S. at 140. \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly, it is this 19th day of March 2025: \nORDERED that the Motion (ECF No. 36) shall be, and is hereby, DENIED.  \n \n                /S/ \n     \n              Julie R.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (“AACTE”), the \nNational Center for Teacher Residencies (“NCTR”), and the Maryland Association of Colleges \nfor Teacher Education (“MACTE”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) seek immediate injunctive relief \nagainst Defendants Denise Carter, in her official capacity as Acting Secretary of Education, the \nUnited States Department of Education (the “Department”), and Donald Trump, in his official \ncapacity as President of the United States, (collectively, “Defendants”) to remedy the unlawful \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ members’ grants.  \nAACTE’s, NCTR’s, and MACTE’s members together comprise hundreds of teacher \npreparation programs throughout the United States. Many of Plaintiffs’ members (the “Grant \nRecipients”)  received  grants  from  the  Department  through  the  Teacher  Quality  Partnership \nProgram (“TQP”), the Supporting Effective Educator Development Program (“SEED”), and the \nTeacher and School Leader Incentive Program (“TSL”), which were used to fund programs to \nprepare and develop educators. Without prior warning, and in reliance on the President’s recent \nExecutive Order regarding DEI initiatives, the Department of Education recently summarily \nterminated many of Plaintiffs’ members’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants. Not only were those \nterminations unlawful in reliance on Executive Order 14151, the Department also failed to follow \nstatute and Federal regulations in terminating the grants, making the terminations unlawful under \nthe Administrative Procedures Act too. \nIn the years that the Department of Education held competitions to award TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants, the Department selected Priorities for applicants from a set of allowable agency \nPriorities enacted through a rulemaking process required by statute. These Priorities were used in \nthe competitions to award TQP, SEED, and TSL grants to AACTE’s and MACTE’s member \norganizations and to NCTR and its member organizations. Pursuant to statute and Department \n1 \n\n \nregulation, Priorities for any competitive grant program must generally be set by Congress or \nthrough notice and comment rulemaking by the Department. Only then can the final published \nagency Priorities apply to the competitive grant programs for selection of grantees in a particular \nfiscal year.  \nIn compliance with statute and its regulation, the Department followed the notice and \ncomment rulemaking process and established several Priorities that were allowable at the time the \nTQP, SEED, and TSL grant Notices for Inviting Applications at issue in this case were published \nin the Federal Register in 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The Department then awarded AACTE’s \nand MACTE’s member organizations and NCTR and its member organizations up to five-year \nTQP grants, up to three-year SEED grants, and/or up to three-year TSL grants that remained active \nthrough early to mid-February 2025. \nBut in February 2025, the Department summarily terminated grants awarded under TQP, \nSEED, and TSL. The purported basis provided by the Department for termination was that the \ngrants are “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], Department priorities.” In form letters \nsent along with the official termination notifications, the Department explained that:  \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected characteristic.  \n \nAfter terminating AACTE’s and MACTE’s member organizations’ and NCTR’s and its \nmember organization’s TQP and SEED grants, the Department issued a press release titled “U.S. \nDepartment of Education Cuts $600 Million in Grants Used to Train Teachers and Education \n2 \n\n \nAgencies  on  Divisive  Ideologies.”  See  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-\ndepartment-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-divisive-teacher-training-grants.  \nNeither the Department’s “official” reason for terminating the grants, as articulated in the \nGrant Award Notifications regarding Department Priorities, nor its actual, publicly-articulated \nreason for termination regarding DEI initiatives, were lawful. The “official” justification is \nunlawful because the federal government has published a regulation governing the termination of \ngrants that the Department did not follow here. The Department’s publicly articulated reason for \nterminating the grants was unlawful because it was predicated on portions of an Executive Order \nthat has been enjoined by this Court.  \nThe Department’s stated reason relied, erroneously, on an implied change in “Department \npriorities.” But Department Priorities are not subject to whim or fiat and, by statute, must instead \nbe established through notice and comment rulemaking. The Department Priorities applicable to \nPlaintiffs’ members’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants are the same today as they were when the grants \nwere awarded because (a) no subsequent rulemaking has taken place; and (b) the statutes that \nestablished Priorities allowable for TQP, SEED, and TSL have not been repealed or amended. \nGiven that the Department Priorities have not changed, and the grants were determined to meet \nthe still-current Priorities during the competition process, it would be arbitrary per se for the \nDepartment to conclude that these grants are not consistent with or do not effectuate those same \n“Department Priorities” now.  \nAs a result of the Department’s improper early terminations, the Grant Recipients have \nbeen and will continue to be deprived of essential funding required to continue their teacher \npreparation  programs  and  the  continuation  of  the  Department’s  unlawful  terminations  will \nirreparably harm Plaintiffs and their members. As such, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \n3 \n\n \nCourt award relief to address the irreparable harm that continues to result from Defendants’ \nunlawful actions. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Overview of TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants and Department Priorities. \n1.  Congress Created and Funded the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \nCongress authorized three programs to prepare and develop educators in the United States: \nTQP, SEED, and TSL. The Teacher Quality Partnership Grant Program provides funding to \neligible partnerships to improve student achievement and the quality of prospective and new \nteachers  by  improving  the  preparation  of  prospective  teachers  and  enhancing  professional \ndevelopment activities for new teachers. See 20 U.S.C. § 1022. The Supporting Effective Educator \nDevelopment Program provides funding to increase the number of highly effective educators in \nthe United States by supporting the implementation of evidence-based practices that prepare, \ndevelop, or enhance the skills of educators. See 20 U.S.C. § 6672. The Teacher and School Leader \nIncentive Program provides funding to serve educators in high-need schools who raise student \nacademic achievement and close the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students. \nTSL  helps  develop,  implement,  improve,  or  expand  comprehensive  performance-based \ncompensation systems or human capital management systems for teachers, principals, or other \nschool leaders. See 20 U.S.C. § 6632.  \nCongress directed the Secretary of the Department of Education (the “Secretary”) to award \ngrants, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities to provide funding consistent with the goals of \nTQP (20 U.S.C. § 1022a(a)), SEED (20 U.S.C. § 6672(a)), and TSL (20 U.S.C. § 6632(a)).  \n2.  Regulations Governing Grant Terminations. \nFederal regulation permits the Department of Education to terminate grants if the grants no \nlonger  effectuate  Department  of  Education  Priorities.  See  2  C.F.R.  § 200.340(a)(2)  (2020); \n4 \n\n \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (2024)). “Department Priorities,” however, is a term of art; in order to \nestablish its Priorities, the Department must, by statute and regulation, go through a notice and \ncomment rulemaking process. See 20 USC § 1232(d); 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2).  \n3.  Statute  and  Department  Regulation  Requirements  for  Setting \nPriorities. \nTo set Department Priorities, the Secretary is required to publish agency Priorities in the \nFederal Register, which must be used to select the Priorities for a competition, and must have gone \nthrough public comment (there are five exceptions to this rule, but none are implicated here). The \nSecretary is likewise required to establish the specific Priorities that are included in the application \nfor each competitive federal grant program, such as TQP, SEED, and TSL, by publishing the \nPriorities in the Notice Inviting Application for the grant in the Federal Register. (34 C.F.R. § \n75.105(b)(1)).  \nAs a federal agency, the Department is unique in the statutory requirement it has to follow \nfor setting agency Priorities for discretionary grants. While the Administrative Procedures Act \n(5 U.S.C. § 553) generally exempts federal agency grants from the rulemaking process, the \nGeneral Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)) alters that rule for the Department of \nEducation; for the Department, the grants exemption for rulemaking only applies to regulations \n(1) that govern the first grant competition under a new or substantially revised program authority \nas determined by the Secretary; or (2) where the Secretary determines rulemaking will cause \nextreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries of the program. (20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)).  \nIn sum, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department must go through \nthe notice and comment rulemaking process.1  \n \n1 While there are limited exceptions to this rule, none of the exceptions are applicable to the analysis here. \n(See 34 C.F.R. 75.105(b)(2)). \n5 \n\n \nGermane here, the Department held competitions for TQP grants in 2020, 2022, and 2024. \nIt also held competitions for SEED grants in 2022, and a competition for TSL grants in 2023. For \neach of these competitions, and in compliance with statute and Department regulation, the \nPriorities were set either by Congress in the program’s authorizing statute or through notice and \ncomment rulemaking. (85 F.R. 29691-29704, 87 F.R. 10906-10923, 89 F.R. 23573-23592, 87 F.R. \n19487-19496, 88 F.R. 33592-33601). \n4.  Department of Education Priorities Applicable to Now-Terminated \nTQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \nIn 2019-2021, the Department established a set of allowable Department Priorities through \nthe proper notice and comment rulemaking process. First, after going through the proper notice \nand comment rulemaking process, the Department published its Notice of Final Priority for \ndiscretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on November 27, 2019. (84 F.R. 65300-\n65303).2 Second, also after the notice and comment rulemaking process, the Department published \na Notice of Final Priorities for all discretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on March \n9, 2020.3 (85 F.R. 13640-13644). Then the Department went through the proper notice and \ncomment rulemaking process once again and published its Notice of Final Priorities for TQP, \nSEED, and TSL grant competitions in the Federal Register on July 9, 2021.4 (86 F.R. 36217-\n \n2 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on July 29, \n2019. (84 F.R. 36504-36507). \n3 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on November \n29, 2019. (84 F.R. 65734-65739). \n4 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on April 20, \n2021. (86 F.R. 20471-20475). \n6 \n\n \n36220). That same day, again after the proper notice and comment rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published a Notice of Final Priority specific for TSL.5  \nFinally, and most recently, the Department went through the required notice and comment \nrulemaking process and published a Notice of Final Priorities for the Secretary’s Supplemental \nPriorities for all discretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on December 10, 2021.6 (86 \nF.R. 70612-70641). \nB.  AACTE’s and MACTE’s Member Organizations and NCTR and its Member \nOrganizations were Awarded TQP, SEED, and/or TSL Grants. \n1.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2020, FY 2022, and FY 2024 TQP \nGrants. \nThere were three TQP competitions relevant to this civil action. First, on May 18, 2020, \nthe Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2020 TQP competition \ninviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (85 F.R. 29691-29704). Second, on February 25, \n2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2022 TQP competition \ninviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (87 F.R. 10906-10923). Third, the Department \npublished a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2024 TQP competition on April 4, 2024 \ninviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (89 F.R. 23573-23592). \nThe project period for the FY 2020, FY 2022, and FY 2024 TQP competitions (the \nmaximum amount of time for which the grants can be awarded) was up to five years. (85 F.R. \n29699, 87 F.R. 10918, 89 F.R. 23587). All three TQP grant competitions included Priorities that \n \n5 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priority for public comment on April 9, \n2021. (86 F.R. 18519-18523). \n6 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on June 30, \n2021. (86 F.R. 34664-34674). \n7 \n\n \nwere established through the required notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from \nallowable activities specified in TQP’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 1022).  \nGrant Recipients were selected to receive funding from the FY 2020 TQP, FY 2022 TQP, \nand FY 2024 TQP competitions for up to a five-year period for each competition. \n2.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2022 SEED Grants. \nOn April 4, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2022 \nSEED competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (87 F.R. 19487-19496). The \nproject period for the FY 2022 SEED competition was up to three years. (87 F.R. 19492). Just like \nthe TQP grant competitions, the SEED grant competition included Priorities that were established \nthrough the required notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities \nspecified in SEED’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 6672). Grant Recipients were selected to \nreceive funding from the FY 2022 SEED competition for up to a three-year period. \n3.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2023 TSL Grants. \nFinally, there is one TSL grant competition relevant to this action. On May 24, 2023, the \nDepartment published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2023 TSL competition, inviting \napplicants to apply for the grant funds. (88 F.R. 33592-33601). The project period for the FY 2023 \nTSL competition was up to three years. (88 F.R. 33598). As with the TQP and SEED grant \ncompetitions, the TSL grant competition also included Priorities that were established through the \nrequired notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified in \nTSL’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 6632). Grant Recipients were selected to receive funding \nfrom the FY 2023 TSL competition for up to a three-year period. \nThe five-year TQP grants, three-year SEED grants, and/or three-year TSL grants all \nremained active through early to mid-February 2025. \n8 \n\n \nC.  The  Department’s  Termination  of  the  TQP,  SEED,  and  TSL  Grants  in \nFebruary 2025. \nWith no notice, and without lawful reason, the Department sent Termination Letters and \nupdated Grant Award Notifications to the majority of the Grant Recipients in February 2025, \ninforming them that their TQP, SEED, and TSL grants were terminated, effective immediately on \nthe date of the letter.7 The substance of every one of the Termination Letters sent to the Grant \nRecipients are identical, indicating the same reasons with the same terminology for the grant \nterminations. See Exhibit B to Complaint.  \nWhile  the  Termination  Letters  provide  that  the  Grant  Recipients  may  challenge  the \ntermination decision by submitting information documenting their position in writing to the \nDepartment within thirty days of the termination, any appeal to the Department does not alter the \nfact that the termination of funding was effective on the date of notification in February 2025. \nThere is no funding provided starting the date of termination pending any appeals.  \nIn both the Grant Award Notifications and the Termination Letters, the purported basis \nprovided by the Department for termination was that the grants are “inconsistent with, and no \nlonger effectuate[], Department priorities.” In the Termination Letters, the Department went on to \nexplain that:  \nIt is a priority of the Department of Education to eliminate discrimination \nin all forms of education throughout the United States. The Acting Secretary \nof Education has determined that, per the Department’s obligations to the \nconstitutional and statutory law of the United States, this priority includes \nensuring  that  the  Department’s  grants  do  not  support  programs  or \norganizations that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion \n(“DEI”) initiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on \nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic. Illegal DEI policies and practices can violate both the letter \nand purpose of Federal civil rights law and conflict with the Department’s \n \n7 While the Department terminated the majority of the Grant Recipients’ grants, some of Plaintiffs’ member \norganizations did not have their TQP grants terminated yet. \n9 \n\n \npolicy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education….the \ngrant specified above provides funding for programs that promote or take \npart in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights \nlaw;  that  conflict  with  the  Department’s  policy  of  prioritizing  merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United \nStates. The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, \nDepartment priorities. \n \nAfter terminating the Grant Recipients’ grants, the Department issued a press release titled \n“U.S.  Department  of  Education  Cuts  $600  Million  in  Grants  Used  to  Train  Teachers  and \nEducation Agencies on Divisive Ideologies.” (Exhibit D to Complaint).8 The press release explains \nthat the grants were terminated because they were using taxpayer funds to train teachers and \neducation agencies on divisive ideologies, such as “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and “equity \ntraining.” See id. \nD.  This Court’s Order Granting Preliminary Injunction in NADOHE et al. v. \nTrump et al. \nOn February 21, 2025, this Court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the President’s \nadministration from enforcing certain provisions of Executive Order 14151, Ending Radical and \nWasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, Executive Order of January 20, 2025, 90 \nFed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) (the “J20 Order”), and Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal \nDiscrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, Executive Order of January 21, 2025, 90 \nFed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (“J21 Order”). National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher \nEducation, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 (D. Md. \nFeb. 21, 2025) (the “NADOHE Order”).  \n \n8  See  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-\ndivisive-teacher-training-grants. \n10 \n\n \nIn relevant part, the NADOHE Order enjoins the President’s administration from enforcing \na provision in Executive Order 14151 requiring “[e]ach agency, department, . . . [to] take the \nfollowing actions within sixty days of this order: (i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by \nlaw, . . . all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts” (the “Termination Provision”). In granting the \npreliminary injunction, the Court held that the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success on their \nclaim  that  the  Termination  Provision  is  void  for  vagueness  under  the  Fifth  Amendment. \nSpecifically, the Order provides:  \nDefendants other than the President, and other persons who are in active concert or \nparticipation with Defendants (the “Enjoined Parties”), shall not: \n \na. pause, freeze, impede, block, cancel, or terminate any awards, contracts \nor obligations (“Current Obligations”), or change the terms of any Current \nObligation, on the basis of the Termination Provision; \n \nExhibit C to Complaint at page 3. The NADOHE Order benefits not just the named plaintiffs in \nthat action, but all contractors and grantees who were subjected to the Termination Provision. \nNADOHE v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 at *28-29. As of the date this \nCourt entered the NADOHE Order (February 21, 2025), Grant Recipients had already received \nthe Termination Letters terminating their grants effective immediately.  \nE.  The Effects of Termination on Plaintiffs and Their Member Organizations. \n1.  Effect of Grant Termination on Ability to Maintain Programs. \nAs of the date of the Termination Letters, funding from the terminated grants has been \nhalted and the Grant Recipients are no longer receiving any funds from the Department under the \ngrants they were awarded pursuant to TQP, SEED, and TSL. (Declaration of Kathlene Campbell \non behalf of NCTR (“NCTR Declaration”) at ¶ 12, Declaration of Carolyn Parker on behalf of \nAmerican University (“AU Declaration”) at ¶ 12, Declaration of Amy Smith on behalf of the \nUniversity of St. Thomas (“UST Declaration”) at ¶ 12, Declaration of Heather Kirkpatrick on \n11 \n\n \nbehalf of Alder Graduate School of Education (“Alder GSE Declaration”) at ¶ 11, Declaration of \nSarah Johnson on behalf of Teaching Lab (“Teaching Lab Declaration”) at ¶ 12). Without the TQP, \nSEED, and TSL grants, Grant Recipients are unable to continue funding their work, which in turn \nimperils Grant Recipients’ ability to maintain the programs funded by the grants. The harm to \nPlaintiffs and their member organizations has been severe, and a continuation of the harm is certain \nand irreparable in the absence of relief from this Court. (See e.g., NCTR Declaration at ¶¶ 13-18, \nAU Declaration at ¶¶ 13-16, UST Declaration at ¶¶ 13-14, Alder GSE Declaration at ¶¶ 12-20, \nTeaching Lab Declaration at ¶¶ 17-26). \nFor example, the termination of Plaintiff NCTR’s SEED grant deprives it the ability to \nserve K-12 school districts where there is high turnover and shortages of teachers and prepare \neducators for careers to help mitigate these teacher shortages. (NCTR Declaration at ¶ 18). In \naddition, absent Court intervention to reinstate American University’s TQP grant, it will be forced \nto shut down its teacher preparation program for special education and early childhood education, \nimpacting up to 1,5000 Washington D.C. children and 48 future educators. (AU Declaration at \n¶¶ 13-14). Similarly, the University of St. Thomas is at risk of losing its student pipeline in areas \nof high-need, such as special education, as a result of the loss of funding for its teacher preparation \nprogram (UST Declaration at ¶ 13) and the termination of TQP grant funds for Alder Graduate \nSchool of Education has had and will continue to have immense impacts for more than 100 aspiring \nteacher candidates and mentor teachers, and hundreds of K-12 students at partner school systems. \n(Alder GSE Declaration at ¶¶ 13-16). In addition, the termination of TSL grant funds will result in \na  loss  of  curriculum-based  professional  learning  and  coaching  services  by  a  non-profit \norganization, Teaching Lab, impacting more than 40 public schools and more than 150 teachers, \n12 \n\n \nwhose instruction in turn reaches well over 6,000 K-12 students. (Teaching Lab Declaration at \n¶¶ 8-9). \nFurther, as a direct result of the termination of the grants, Plaintiffs’ member organizations \nwill see a decline in enrollment, and it will exacerbate the on-going teacher shortages nationwide, \nand thwart their efforts to prepare future educators for success. \nFinally, the termination of the Grant Recipients’ grants imperils their ability to perform \ntheir primary missions as nonprofit membership organizations that depend on grants to fulfill their \nprimary purposes for existence.  \n2.  Effect of Special Condition on Grants. \nIn  addition  to  the  immediate  and  irreparable  effects  of  terminating  the  grants,  the \nDepartment added a special condition to impacted grants requiring prior approval for them to draw \ndown funds, referred to as “route pay.” In violation of Federal regulations, the Department did not \nprovide any notice or explanation for this blanket condition imposed on terminated grants. See 2 \nC.F.R.  §  200.208.  This  new,  unlawfully-imposed  condition  will  cause  delays  in  the  Grant \nRecipients receiving their grant funds and add subjectivity to already approved costs, which the \nGrant  Recipients  reasonably  fear  will  provide  further  opportunities  for  the  Department  to \nunlawfully deprive them of funding. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is intended “to preserve the relative positions of the parties until \na trial on the merits can be held.” United States v. South Carolina, 720 F.3d 518, 524 (4th Cir. \n2013); see also Stinnie v. Holcomb, 77 F.4th 200, 212 (4th Cir. 2023) (“The traditional office of a \npreliminary injunction . . . is to protect the status quo . . . .”). Such injunctive relief is warranted \nwhere a moving party has demonstrated that: “(1) the party is likely to succeed on the merits of \nthe claim; (2) the party is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) the \n13 \n\n \nbalance of hardships weighs in the party’s favor; and (4) the injunction serves the public interest.” \nHIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 318 (4th Cir. 2021); see also Frazier v. Prince George’s Cnty., \n86 F.4th 537, 543 (4th Cir. 2023) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). \nThe  final  two  factors—the  balance  of  equities  and  the  public  interest—“merge  when  the \nGovernment is the opposing party.” Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 365 (4th Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). The same standard applies to a temporary \nrestraining order (“TRO”). ClearOne Advantage, LLC v. Kersen, 710 F. Supp. 3d 425 (D. Md. \n2024) (“The standards for granting a TRO and granting a preliminary injunction are the same.”) \n(citation omitted). \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nThe harms from the prospective and continuing effects of the grant terminations on \nPlaintiffs and their member organizations are devastating and irreparable. Defendants’ actions \nviolate both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. Neither principles of equity \nnor the public have any interest in violation of the law, much less where the violation compromises \nthe public interest by terminating funding for programs designed to prepare, develop, and promote \neducators across the United States. A TRO and preliminary injunction should issue to prevent these \nfurther harms until the Court has the opportunity to further consider the merits of the case. \nA.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n“To secure a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must ‘make a clear showing that [it is] likely \nto succeed at trial, [but it] need not show a certainty of success.’” Ass’n of Am. Publishers, Inc. v. \nFrosh, 586 F. Supp. 3d 379, 388 (D. Md. 2022) (quoting Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 321 (4th \nCir. 2013)) (alterations in original); see also Jensen v. Md. Cannabis Admin., 719 F. Supp. 466, \n473 (D. Md. 2024) (same).  \n14 \n\n \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims because Defendants’ actions in \nterminating the grants were unlawful in two respects. First, the Department’s publicly-articulated \nreason for termination in reliance on the Executive Order 14151’s directive to terminate “equity- \nrelated” grants was unlawful because that portion of the Executive Order has been enjoined by this \nCourt and found likely to violate the law. It follows that its use to terminate the grants was \nunlawful, and the justification for perpetuating those terminations likewise unlawful. Second, the \nDepartment’s  “official”  reason  for  terminating  the  grants  –  purported  inconsistency  with \nDepartment Priorities – is also unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious because the federal government \nhas published a regulation governing the termination of grants that the Department did not follow. \n1.  Plaintiffs are Likely To Succeed on their Fifth Amendment Due Process \n(Vagueness) Claim. \na. The Termination Provision is Impermissibly Vague and Violates the \nFifth Amendment’s Protection of Due Process (Count I). \nThis  Court  has  already  determined  that  the  Termination  Provision  is  likely  to  be \nimpermissibly  vague  in  violation  of  the  Fifth  Amendment.  Its  use  to  terminate  the  Grant \nRecipients’ grants, and its potential future use to terminate more of Plaintiffs’ members’ grants, is \nlikewise unlawful. As a result, Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that the Department’s \ncontinuing refusal to fund the grants is unlawful.  \nThe  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  provides  that  “[n]o  person  shall \nbe . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. A \nfederal law is unconstitutionally vague if it “fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair \nnotice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously \ndiscriminatory enforcement.”9 United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008) (citing Hill v. \n \n9 While many void for vagueness arguments are directed at statutes, the same principles apply when the \nsubject of the challenge is an executive order. Humanitarian Law Project v. U.S. Treasury Dep’t, 578 F.3d \n15 \n\n \nColorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000)); see also Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d \n264, 272 (4th Cir. 2019) (applying void for vagueness doctrine to “purely civil statutes”).  \n“[I]f arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide \nexplicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy \nmatters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the \nattendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.” Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09 \n(footnotes omitted). If an executive order’s terms are not “susceptible of a clear meaning,” and the \nexecutive order does not “mitigate the vagueness of the term by supplying any definition,” then \nthe provision “lends itself to subjective interpretation” and is unconstitutional. Humanitarian Law \nProject v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 463 F. Supp. 2d 1049, 1070 (C.D. Cal. 2006). \nThe Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 is unconstitutionally vague because \nit invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. It does not define key terms, including “DEI,” \n“DEIA,” “equity” or “equity- related” and, as a result, fails to satisfy the constitutional minimum. \nInstead,  it  leaves  federal  agencies  discretion  to  enforce  the  provision  in  a  “seriously \ndiscriminatory” manner. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 732. These are broad terms; their meanings are not \nreadily limited. As a result, the Termination Provision leaves Department’s decisionmakers “the \njob of shaping a vague statute’s contours through their enforcement decisions.” Sessions, 584 U.S. \nat 182 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). Because the Department is impermissibly free to pick and choose \nin an arbitrary and discriminatory fashion, the Termination Provision in Executive Order 14151 is \nunconstitutionally vague. \n \n1133, 1146-47 (9th Cir. 2009) (applying statutory void for vagueness principles and caselaw to challenge \nconcerning executive order). \n16 \n\n \nb. This Court’s NADOHE Order Applies to Plaintiffs in this Action and the \nDepartment should be Enjoined from Enforcing the Termination of the \nTQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \nThe nationwide injunction in the NADOHE Order is not explicit as to whether it requires \nthe Department to refrain from enforcement of final action taken with respect to the subject matter \ncovered by the Order but undertaken before the Order was published. While the Order’s spirit \nmakes clear that the Government’s refusal to continue to fund grants canceled in adherence to the \nTermination Clause is prospectively unlawful, the Order does not explicitly vacate such orders or \nreturn parties to the status quo prior to agency action predicated on the Termination Clause. The \nCourt should issue a new injunction in this case clarifying that issue as to the Grant Recipients and \nall similarly-situated grantees.  \nThe Grant Award Notifications and Termination Letters did not make an explicit reference \nto Executive Order 14151 as the reason for terminating the grants, but the Department published \na press release on February 17, 2025 that explains that the grants were terminated because they \nwere using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education agencies on divisive ideologies, such as \n“Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and “equity training” – the same directive of the Termination \nProvision. (Exhibit D to Complaint). This explicit (and plainly intentional) connection of the \nTermination Provision in Executive Order 14151 with the grant terminations by the Government \nis unambiguous. \nThe Termination Letters also reference the Department’s position to “ensure[] that the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives[.]” (Exhibit B to Complaint at pages 1, 3, 5, 7, \n9, 11, 13). While the Grant Award Notifications and Termination Letters state that the grants were \nterminated  because  they  were  “inconsistent  with,  and  no  longer  effectuate[],  Department \npriorities,” it is clear from the Government’s conduct that the grants were terminated pursuant to \n17 \n\n \nthe now-enjoined Termination Provision (which, as discussed below, is not actually a Department \nPriority in any case). \nThe NADOHE Order benefits all contractors and grantees who were subject to the \nTermination Provision. NADOHE v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 at *28-\n29. Even so, this Court’s NADOHE Order has left a gap of unlawful conduct where the Department \ncontinues to enforce what it would be enjoined from undertaking now. Plaintiffs seek relief \ndirecting the Department to return the Grant Recipients to the status quo ante with respect to \nExecutive Order 14151 and vacate or order rescinded the terminations of their TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants. \n2.  The Department’s Termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants \nViolates the Administrative Procedures Act (Count II). \nThe Department’s termination of the grants because they were allegedly “inconsistent with, \nand no longer effectuate[], Department priorities” is also unlawful because it is contrary to statute \nand  regulation  the  Department  is  obliged  to  follow,  and  thus  violates  the  APA.  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) (courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions” \nif they are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”). \na. Defendants’ Grant Terminations were Final Agency Actions. \nUnder the APA, courts may review “final agency action.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. There are two \nhallmarks of final agency action: first, the action “mark[s] the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process;” and second, it is an action by which “rights or obligations have been \ndetermined” or “from which “legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-\n78 (1997) (citations omitted); see also Am. Acad. of Pediatrics v. Food and Drug Admin., 379 F. \nSupp. 3d 461, 487 (D. Md. 2019). Put another way, “[t]he core question is whether the agency has \n18 \n\n \ncompleted its decisionmaking process, and whether the result of that process is one that will \ndirectly affect the parties.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992). \nThe Supreme Court has instructed that the finality requirement be applied in a “flexible” \nand “pragmatic” way. Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149-50 (1967). In determining \nwhether agency action is final, the Supreme Court has instructed courts to consider whether the \naction “‘is sufficiently direct and immediate,’ and has a ‘direct effect on day-to-day business.’” \nFranklin, 505 U.S. at 796-97 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 152). One indicator of finality is \n“whether the agency views its deliberative process as sufficiently final to demand compliance with \nits announced position.” Den-Mat Corp. v. U.S., Food & Drug Admin., Civ. No. MJG-92-444, \n1992 WL 208962, at *3 (D. Md. Aug. 17, 1992) (quoting Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. U.S.E.P.A., 801 \nF.2d 430, 436 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). \nFederal district courts across the country have concluded that legal consequences flow from \nan agency’s decision to terminate future federal funding. Multnomah Cnty. v. Azar, 340 F. Supp. \n3d 1046, 1056 (D. Or. 2018) (“With respect to the second prong, legal consequences flow from an \nagency’s decision that prohibits future federal funding.”); Arizona State Bd. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \n391 F. Supp. 2d 800, 802 (D. Az. 2005) (explaining that there is “no dispute that the DOE’s \nDetermination results in ‘legal consequences,’ namely the prohibition of future federal funding of \nfor-profit charter schools”); XP Vehicles, Inc. v. Dep’t of Energy, 118 F. Supp. 3d 38, 60 (D.D.C. \n2015) (“It is clear beyond cavil that the rejection of a request for a government benefit . . . ‘fixes \nsome legal relationship’ between a private party and the government.”). \nHere, Defendants’ termination of the Grant Recipients’ grants constitutes final agency \naction. The Termination Letters each provide that the “Department hereby terminates grant No. [] \nin its entirety effective 2/[]/25.” This demand for immediate compliance with the Department’s \n19 \n\n \nposition marks the consummation of the Department’s decision-making process. As of the date of \nthe Termination Letters, the Department stopped providing funding approved by the grants. \n(NCTR Declaration at ¶ 12, AU Declaration at ¶ 12, UST Declaration at ¶ 12, Alder GSE \nDeclaration at ¶ 11, Teaching Lab Declaration at ¶ 12). The Department’s action unequivocally \nestablished that the rights of Grant Recipients to receive the funds was terminated. Instantly \nfollowing the Department’s determination to halt funding, there was a direct and immediate effect \non Plaintiffs and their member organizations – without the funding from the grants, Grant \nRecipients cannot continue to operate their teacher preparation programs. \nWhile  the  Termination  Letters  provide  that  the  Grant  Recipients  may  challenge  the \ntermination decision by submitting information documenting their position in writing to the \nDepartment within thirty days of the termination, the Department’s termination took effect \nimmediately, and even if a Grant Recipient challenges the determination, the funding will not \nresume absent intervention from this Court. And while the Termination Letters invite Grant \nRecipients to submit an objection to the termination decision, they contain no promise that the \nDepartment will conduct a further review, nor any timeframe or process by which the Department \nintends review such a challenge, if at all.10 In any event,“[t]he mere possibility that an agency \nmight  reconsider”  its  decision  “does  not  suffice  to  make  an  otherwise  final  agency  action \nnonfinal.” Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 127 (2012). Accordingly, the Department’s termination \nof the grants constitutes final action under the APA. See id. \n \n10 The Termination Letters are problematic for other reasons, too. Most notably, the form letters failed to \nprovide basic notice by omitting any specificity about the reason that the Department found any individual \ngrant “inconsistent with. . . Department priorities.” The letters instead merely list, disjunctively, five vague \nways in which the specific grant at issue might be “inconsistent.” This does not put the Grant Recipients on \nnotice for the reason for termination and of course thereby deprives them of any meaningful basis to \nchallenge the termination. \n \n20 \n\n \nThe consequences of the termination of grant funds has already been felt by the Grant \nRecipients. As a result of the termination of their TQP, SEED, and TSL grants, Grant Recipients \nwill be unable to continue their teacher preparation programs established and run by the grants’ \nfunding, which of course has a direct impact on their day-to-day business. See Franklin, 505 U.S. \nat 796-97 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 152). For example, the termination of NCTR’s SEED \ngrant will result in a $1,188,070 overall loss, including a $332,000 direct loss to NCTR, as well as \na loss of $360,000 in expenses to contractors and a $495,000 loss in subgrants to the thirteen \nteacher residency programs funded by the grant. (NCTR Declaration at ¶ 13). Without their \nterminated grant funds, American University will no longer be able to maintain its teacher \npreparation program designed to remedy the dramatic teacher shortage and improve outcomes for \nearly childhood and special education students in Washington D.C. (AU Declaration at ¶ 13). \nLikewise, due to the termination of its TQP grant, the University of St. Thomas is at risk of losing \nin student pipeline, such as special education, resulting in widespread negative impacts on the \nmany  communities,  teachers  and  students  these  teacher  pipeline  programs  benefit.  (UST \nDeclaration at ¶ 13). By way of yet another example, the Department’s termination of two TQP \ngrants for Alder Graduate School of Education has immense impacts on its day-to-day business, \naffecting teacher preparation programs with 83 current teacher candidates and thwarted plans to \nrecruit  80  additional  teacher  candidates  in  the  remaining  years  of  the  grants.  (Alder  GSE \nDeclaration at ¶¶ 13-15). Furthermore, as a direct result of the termination of a TSL grant, a non-\nprofit organization which provides professional learning and coaching services to improve teacher \npractice and student learning will no longer be able to provide such services to over 40 schools. \n(Teaching Lab Declaration at ¶¶ 9, 17-18). \n21 \n\n \nThe termination of the Grant Recipients’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants is also resulting in, \nand will continue to result in, loss of employment for the dedicated staff members and grant \nmanagers who worked to make the teacher preparation programs run, a harm that cannot be \nremedied at summary judgment when fundamental changes to the structure and business of \nPlaintiffs’ members have already been made by necessity. (See e.g., NCTR Declaration at ¶ 14, \nAU Declaration at ¶ 16, Alder GSE at ¶ 17). Termination of the grants will also lead to a decline \nin enrollment at many of Plaintiffs’ member organizations. (See e.g., AU Declaration at ¶ 13, Alder \nGSE Declaration at ¶¶ 14-15, NCTR Declaration at ¶ 14). \nb. Defendants’ Action are Arbitrary and Capricious. \nThe termination of the subject grants is unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious because it is not \n“reasonable and reasonably explained.” Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, \n592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). While a court may not “substitute its own policy judgment for that of \nthe agency,” id., it must ensure that the agency has “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] \n‘a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 9, 43 (1983). Agency action is “substantive[ly] unreasonable[]” when “the \nagency exercised its discretion unreasonably.” Multicultural Media, Telecom & Internet Council \nv. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 873 F.3d 932, 936 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Kavanaugh, J.). Where, as here, \nthe Department exercises its discretion to act counter to statute and regulation, its action is per se \nunreasonable. \nThe proffered reason by the Department for the termination of the grants – that they “are \ninconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities” – is contrary to the law. Statute \nand regulation require the Secretary to publish Department Priorities for program grants in the \nFederal Register, subject to a notice and comment period. (20 U.S.C. § 1232(d), 34 C.F.R. \n22 \n\n \n§ 75.105(b)(2)). The Secretary then selects allowable Priorities to include in the applications for \nthe grant competitions which are published in the Federal Register. (34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)). The \nDepartment cannot, by law, determine that with a change in administration, specific Department \nPriorities for grant programs are no longer allowable unless and until the Department engages in \nrulemaking to propose and issue new Final Priorities.  \nSimply  put,  the  current  administration  has  not  gone  through  a  notice  and  comment \nrulemaking process to issue new Final Priorities, so the current Final Priorities remain Department \nPriorities. As a result, and contrary to the Department’s official reasons, the grants at issue are \nconsistent with the current Department Priorities. It would be arbitrary per se for the Department \nto conclude that these grants are not consistent with or do not effectuate those same “Department \nPriorities” merely because they say so. If the Department wishes to establish new Department \nPriorities, it may do so only through the means established by law, not through whim or fiat.  \nB.  In the Absence of an Injunction, Plaintiffs are Certain to Suffer Irreparable \nHarm. \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must “demonstrate irreparable injury is likely \nin the absence of an injunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis in original, collecting cases); \nCentro Tepeyac v. Montgomery Cnty., 722 F.3d 184, 188 (4th Cir. 2013). “To establish irreparable \nharm, the movant must make a ‘clear showing’ that it will suffer harm that is ‘neither remote nor \nspeculative, but actual and imminent.’” Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres of Land, \nOwned by Sandra Townes Powell, 915 F.3d 197, 216 (4th Cir. 2019) (quoting Direx Israel, Ltd. v. \nBreakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991)). Harm is irreparable if the injury \n“cannot be fully rectified by the final judgment after trial.” Ass’n of Am. Publishers, 586 F. Supp. \n3d at 388 (quoting Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, 915 F.3d at 216; Vitkus v. Blinken, 79 F.4th \n23 \n\n \n352, 367 (4th Cir. 2023) (finding existence of irreparable harm where no adequate relief could be \nrecovered at the conclusion of trial). \nA showing of irreparable harm occurs where a plaintiff demonstrates a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of a constitutional claim. Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle v. Baltimore Police \nDep’t, 2 F.4th 330, 346 (4th Cir. 2021) (“Because there is a likely constitutional violation, the \nirreparable harm factor is satisfied.”) (citation omitted); see also Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 \nF.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“It has long been established that the loss of constitutional \nfreedoms, ‘for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’”) \n(quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)).  \nA mission-oriented organization also has a likelihood of irreparable injury where “the \n‘actions taken by the defendant have perceptively impaired the organization’s program’” and \n“make it more difficult for [organizations] to accomplish [their] primary mission[s].” Open \nCommunities All. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 177 (D.D.C. 2017); AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. \nv. United States Dep’t of State, No. CV 25-00400 (AHA), 2025 WL 485324, at *4 (D.D.C. Feb. \n13, 2025), enforced, No. CV 25-00400 (AHA), 2025 WL 569381 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025) (finding \nirreparable injury where loss of funding would make it more difficult to accomplish organization’s \nprimary mission).  \nIn addition, economic harm may also prove irreparable if it is severe enough to threaten an \norganization’s  existence.  Packard  Elevator  v.  I.C.C.,  782  F.  2d  112,  115  (8th  Cir.  1986) \n(“Recoverable monetary loss may constitute irreparable harm only where the loss threatens the \nvery existence of the [plaintiff]’s business.”); see also National Ass’n of Diversity Officers in \nHigher Educ. v. Trump, Case No. 1:25-cv-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 53764, at *26 (D. Md. Feb. 21, \n2025) (same); Coalition for Common Sense in Gov’t Procurement v. United States, 576 F. Supp. \n24 \n\n \n2d 162, 168 (2008) (“To successfully shoehorn potential economic loss into a showing of \nirreparable harm, a plaintiff must establish that the economic harm is so severe as to ‘cause extreme \nhardship to the business’ or threaten its very existence.”) (citations omitted); see also Texas \nChildren’s Hosp. v. Burwell, 76 F. Supp. 3d 224, 243-44 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding irreparable harm \nthat is economic in nature where non-profit completely “shut out” of hospital funding program). \n“The critical consideration under this exception is the effect that the purported economic harm will \nhave on a movant’s business or its very existence—not any monetary amount per se.” Sterling \nCommercial Credit—Michigan, LLC v. Phoenix Indus. I, LLC, 762 F. Supp. 2d 8, 15 (D.D.C. \n2011).  \n1.  Certain and Irreparable Harm to Plaintiffs and Their Member \nOrganizations. \nFirst, there is a likelihood of success on the merits of a constitutional claim here, and thus \nthe irreparable harm factor is per se satisfied. Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle v. Baltimore Police \nDep’t, 2 F.4th 330, 346 (4th Cir. 2021). \nSecond, the Grant Recipients are being deprived of essential funding required to continue \ntheir teacher preparation programs. Without Court intervention, Defendants’ actions unlawfully \ndepriving them of funding will:  \n  Force many Grant Recipients to shutter their programs, including teacher preparation \nprograms  designed  to  support  educators  in  critical  areas  of  need,  including  special \neducation and early childhood education. (See e.g., AU Declaration at ¶ 13). \n  Significantly reduce the Grant Recipients’ ability to address the on-going teacher shortage \nand  cause  an  exacerbation  of  the  teacher  shortage,  especially  in  rural  and  urban \ncommunities,  across  the  country.  (See  e.g.,  NCTR  Declaration  at  ¶ 18;  Alder  GSE \nDeclaration at ¶ 16). \n25 \n\n \n  Result in termination of employment for the dedicated staff members, coaches, and grant \nmanagers who work to make the teacher preparation programs run. (See e.g., NCTR \nDeclaration at ¶ 14; AU Declaration at ¶ 16; Alder GSE Declaration at ¶ 17; Teaching Lab \nDeclaration at ¶¶ 19-20).  \n  Result in a widespread cut and/or reduction of scholarships and living wage stipends for \nfuture educators to pursue degrees in education in underserved rural, urban, suburban, and \nexurban communities. (See e.g., UST Declaration at ¶¶ 7-8; Alder GSE Declaration at \n¶¶ 13-15). \n  Result in a widespread cut and/or reduction of mentor teacher stipends for teachers in K-\n12 schools who work to train and develop new teachers in areas of high-need. (See e.g., \nAlder GSE Declaration at ¶¶ 13-15). \n  Cut curriculum-based professional learning and coaching services designed to improve \nteacher practice and student learning at over 40 K-12 schools and result in a loss of a \nrigorous study to help school districts evaluate how best to spend their limited funds and \nlimited teacher development time and resources. (Teaching Lab Declaration at ¶¶ 9, 17-18, \n21-22). \n  Lead to a decline in enrollment at many of Plaintiffs’ member organizations. This includes \na decline in current enrollment for students participating in teacher preparation programs \nwho will no longer be able to afford to attend Plaintiffs’ member organizations due to the \ntermination of funding supplied for stipends, support for licensure examinations and \ntutoring, and tuition assistance. The termination of grants also impairs the ability of \nPlaintiffs’ member organizations to recruit future students. (See e.g., AU Declaration at \n¶ 13, Alder GSE Declaration at ¶¶ 14-15, NCTR Declaration at ¶ 14). \n26 \n\n \nFor the Grant Recipients, the harm is actual, not theoretical, as the funding was terminated \nin February 2025, immediately resulting in many of the Grant Recipients’ inability to continue \ntheir programs. The harm to the participants was even more impactful given that the terminations \noccurred in the middle of the school year. Similarly, for any Grant Recipients whose grants have \nnot yet been terminated, but whose termination is forthcoming, and similarly situated to the grants \nat issue here, the imminence of their injuries is evident from the Department’s publicly-articulated \ndesire to cut these grants used to train teachers and education agencies and the plain language of \nthe directive from the Executive Order to take immediate action with at most 60 days from the \ndate of the January 20, 2025 order. It is clear that the Department is moving swiftly to eliminate \nfunding for all teacher preparation grants, and the termination of the grants that have not been \nterminated is imminent. The harm that this loss of funding will cause nationally is likewise \nimmense,  strangling  the  viability  of  the  teacher  preparation  programs  that  schools  and \ncommunities desperately need. \nThe termination of the grants also completely eviscerates’ Plaintiffs’ missions to “elevate \neducation  and  educator  preparation  through  research,  professional  practice,  advocacy,  and \ncollaboration,” to “transform educator preparation by advancing the teacher residency movement \nto prepare, support, and retain more effective educators who represent and value the communities \nthey serve” and to “serve as a distinct statewide voice on matters of importance to educator \npreparation programs at [] colleges and universities.” 11 Without the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants \nto fund the teacher preparation programs, Plaintiffs and their member organizations will no longer \nbe able to prepare/support and retain educators, which not only thwarts their missions, but also has \n \n11 See https://aacte.org/about/, https://nctresidencies.org/about-nctr/, \nhttps://mactemaryland.wixsite.com/maryland-association.  \n27 \n\n \na devastating impact on the communities they serve. With the loss of funding and slashed \nprograms, Plaintiffs’ member organizations will no longer be able to support and train teaching \ncandidates to work in partner K-12 schools. Many pre-K through year 12 schools rely on the \nteacher preparation programs funded by the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants to support their students. \nFor example, without their TQP grant funding, American University will no longer be able to fund \nadditional cohorts of its teacher residency program. As a result, the Washington D.C. Friendship \nPublic Charter Schools will lose the support of the teacher candidates working in their early \nchildhood and special education classrooms. (AU Declaration at ¶ 13). The University of St. \nThomas will no longer be able to fund a majority of scholarships for undergraduate and graduate \nstudents who are pursuing teacher licensure and degrees in special education and elementary \neducation. (UST Declaration at ¶¶ 6, 7). The stipends for Alder Graduate School of Education’s \naspiring teachers and mentor teachers at its partner K-12 school systems will lose the majority of \ntheir funding, resulting in expected harm of over $2 million for the partner K-12 school systems. \n(Alder GSE Declaration at ¶¶ 13-16). Teaching Lab will no longer be able to provide professional \nlearning and coaching services to over 40 K-12 schools. (Teaching Lab Declaration at ¶¶ 9, 17-\n18). NCTR’s thirteen teacher residency programs that were funded by a terminated grant are all in \njeopardy, depriving Plaintiff NCTR of its ability to serve K-12 school districts where there is a \nhigh turnover and shortages of teachers and prepare educators for careers to help mitigate these \nteacher shortages. (NCTR Declaration at ¶ 18). \n2.  Harm  Resulting  from  Defendants’  Unlawfully  Imposed  Grant \nConditions. \nThe Grant Recipients are also being harmed by the Department’s special condition put on \nthe grants during their period for drawing down the funds. Generally, unless a grantee poses a \nspecific risk, they can draw down funds from their grant award based on the allowable, allocable \n28 \n\n \nand reasonable costs approved in their grant budget without prior approval. Here, the Department \nadded a special condition to impacted grants after they were terminated requiring prior approval \nfor them to draw down funds.  This special condition is referred to as “route pay.” The grantees \nare eligible for costs that were properly incurred before their termination date and costs that would \nnot have occurred if the grant was not terminated. They have 120 days to draw down the funds \nafter the termination date. (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.472, 200.343, 200.344(b)). \nThe regulations that govern federal grants set the reasons that the Department can put \nconditions on grants and the requirements for notice prior to doing so. Imposing a special \ncondition, such as establishing additional prior approvals, on a grant can only be done if the grantee \nis determined to pose a risk. Factors that may be considered are financial stability, quality of \nmanagement systems and standards, history of performance, audit reports and filings, ability to \neffectively implement requirements, history of compliance with conditions of a federal award, or \na responsibility determination. (2 C.F.R. § 200.208). \nBefore conditions are placed on a grant, the agency must notify the grantee as to: (1) the \nnature of the additional requirements; (2) the reason why the additional requirements are being \nimposed; (3) the nature of the action needed to remove the additional requirement, if applicable; \n(4) the time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and (5) the method for requesting \nreconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. (Id.). \nWithout notice or any finding of individual grantee risk, the Department put a blanket \ncondition on the terminated grants to require prior approval for all remaining drawdowns.  This \nnew, unlawfully-imposed condition will cause delays in the Grant Recipients receiving their grant \nfunds and potential subjectivity added to disturbing already approved costs.  \n29 \n\n \nC.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Favor Injunctive Relief. \nWith regard to the final two factors, which merge for purposes of this analysis, courts “must \nbalance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.” Ass’n of Am. Publishers, 586 F. Supp. 3d at 388 (quoting \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 23; see also ICENY USA, LLC v. M & M’s, LLC, 421 F. Supp. 3d 204, 222-23 \n(D. Md. 2019). \nHere, the balance of the equities favors preliminary relief because Fourth Circuit caselaw \n“counsels that ‘[the government] is in no way harmed by issuance of a preliminary injunction \nwhich prevents [it] from enforcing restrictions likely to be found unconstitutional. If anything, the \nsystem is improved by such an injunction.” Centro Tepeyac, 722 F.3d at 191 (quoting Giovani \nCarandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. 2002)). Similarly, it is axiomatic that the \npublic interest favors protecting constitutional rights. See id. (“It also teaches that ‘upholding \nconstitutional rights surely serves the public interest.’”) (quoting Giovani Carandola, 303 F.3d at \n521); see also Newsom ex. rel. Newsom v. Albemarle Cnty. Sch. Bd., 354 F.3d 249, 261 (4th Cir. \n2003) (recognizing that a governmental entity “is in no way harmed by issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction” that prevents enforcement of a policy likely to be found unconstitutional). \nThe equities also tip in Plaintiffs’ favor. On one hand, requiring the Department to continue \nthe Grant Recipients’ grants would continue the status quo that would have resulted had the \nDepartment not unlawfully terminated the grants. The government would suffer no harm if the \npreliminary injunction is granted, just as they suffered no harm from the status quo before the \ngrants  were  terminated.  The  Department  would  simply  be  directed  to  continue  its  regular \nobligation of Congressionally-approved funding that it had already committed to spend to fund the \nTQP, SEED, and TSL grants. On the other hand, the Grant Recipients’ teaching preparation \nprograms provide an essential service furthering important public interest in education that will be \n30 \n\n \ndestroyed absent Court intervention. Accordingly, the balance of equities and public interest favor \ninjunctive relief.  \nD.  No Bond Is Necessary. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) contemplates “security” the Court can order to “pay the costs and \ndamages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” A district \ncourt may waive the bond requirement. See Md. Dept. of Hum. Resources v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., \n976 F.2d 1462, 1483 n.23 (4th Cir. 1992) (recognizing “a district court’s discretion to set a bond \namount of zero where the enjoined or restrained party faces no likelihood of material harm”) (citing \ncases); see also Metro. Reg’l Info. Sys. v. Am. Home Realty Network, Inc., 904 F. Supp. 2d 530, \n536 (D. Md. 2012) (“Where the district court determines that the risk of harm is remote, or that \nthe circumstances otherwise warrant, the court may fix the amount of bond accordingly. In some \ncircumstances, a nominal bond may suffice.”) (quoting Candle Factory, Inc. v. Trade Assocs. Grp., \nLtd., 23 Fed. App’x. 134, 139 (4th Cir. 2001)); Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 332 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(“[T]he district court retains the discretion to set the bond amount as it sees fit or waive the security \nrequirement.”). Indeed, in NADOHE, this Court effectively waived the bond requirement and “set \na nominal bond of zero dollars.” No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 at *30. Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs request that no bond or security be ordered. In the alternative, Plaintiffs request a nominal \nbond of $100. \nV.  CONCLUSION  \nFor these reasons, and the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the \nCourt enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.

Civil No.: 1:25-cv-00702-JRR \n \nLINDA MCMAHON, in her official  \ncapacity as Secretary of Education, et al., \n   \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER1 \n  This matter comes before the court on Defendants Linda McMahon, in her official capacity \nas Secretary of Education, U.S. Department of Education, and Donald J. Trump’s, in his official \ncapacity as President of the United States, Motion to Stay and Suspend Injunction Pending Appeal.  \n(ECF No. 44; the “Motion.”)  The court has reviewed all papers.  No hearing is necessary.  Local \nRule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023).    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs discussed at length in its memorandum opinion issued March 17, 2025 (ECF No. 32), \nPlaintiffs AACTE, NCTR, and MACTE initiated this action on March 5, 2025, asserting two \nclaims: violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Count I) and violation of the \nAPA (Count II).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the Department’s termination of grants \nawarded through the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Programs.  Following briefing and a hearing on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 5), the court \ngranted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion (construed, by agreement of the parties, as one \n \n1 All terms defined in the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. 32 shall have the same meanings here.   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 2 of 10\nfor preliminary injunction only).  (ECF Nos. 32, 33.)  Specifically, the court held that Plaintiffs \ndemonstrated a clear likelihood of success on their APA claim and issued a preliminary injunction \nthat, inter alia, requires Defendants to reinstate TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards of Plaintiff \nNCTR and Plaintiffs’ members, and enjoins Defendants from terminating TQP, SEED, or TSL \nawards in a manner the court found likely violative of the APA.  Id.  Defendants are required to \nreinstate the aforementioned TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant Awards within five business days of the \ncourt’s order.  (ECF No. 33.)   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c), a preliminary injunction is not stayed \nfollowing a notice of appeal “[u]nless the court orders otherwise.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 62(c); see also \nFED. R. APP. 8(a)(1) (providing that “[a] party must ordinarily move first in the district court \nfor . . . an order suspending . . . an injunction while an appeal is pending”).  The Supreme Court \nhas set forth four factors to consider in determining whether to stay the order of preliminary \ninjunction pending Defendants’ appeal: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 \n(1987).2   \nThe first two factors are “the most critical.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  \nThe last two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Id. at 435.  Here, \n \n2 The Hilton factors are similar to the Winter factors a plaintiff bears on a motion for preliminary injunction.  See ECF \nNo. 32 at pp. 14–15; Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008) (“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \ninterest.”); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (observing that “[t]here is substantial overlap between” the \nfactors governing issuance of a stay pending appeal and “the factors governing preliminary injunctions.”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 3 of 10\nbecause Defendants are the parties seeking a stay, they bear the burden to demonstrate the factors \nweigh in favor of a stay.  Dep’t of Educ. v. Louisiana, 603 U.S. 866, 868 (2024) (providing that \n“the burden is on the Government as applicant to show, among other things, a likelihood of success \n. . . and that the equities favor a stay”).   \nIII.  ANALYSIS  \nA.  Whether Defendants Make a Strong Showing They Are Likely to Succeed on Merits \nAs set forth at length in the memoranda opinions on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction and on Defendants’ Emergency Motion for Reconsideration (ECF Nos. 32 and 42), \nPlaintiffs ably met their burden to demonstrate a clear showing of likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their APA claim (Count II) in two primary ways:   \n \n. . . Plaintiffs have made a clear showing of likelihood of success on \nthe merits of their APA claim. Specifically, the court finds that the \nDepartment’s Termination Letter, and the Department’s termination \nof the Grant Recipients’ Grant Awards are likely to be proven \narbitrary  and  capricious,  because  the  Department’s  action  was \nunreasonable, not reasonably explained, based on factors Congress \nhad  not  intended  the  Department  to  consider  (i.e.,  not  agency \npriorities), and otherwise not in accordance with law. 16 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A); Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 \n(2019); FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 \n(2021); Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of the Interior, 899 F.3d \n260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018). \n \nand \n \n. . . Plaintiffs . . . make a clear showing of likelihood of success on \ntheir APA claim because the Termination Letters fail to provide \nGrant Recipients any workable, sensible, or meaningful reason or \nbasis for the termination of their awards. . . .  The Department has \nnot provided the “reasonable explanation” of its final agency action \nthe APA requires.  Prometheus, 592 U.S. at 423.  The Termination \nLetter’s  list  of  ways  in  which  a  Grant  Recipient’s  program  is \n“inconsistent” with Department priorities is so broad and vague as \nto be limitless; devoid of import, even.  Coupled with the disjunctive \nnature of the list (“. . . or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 4 of 10\nof  the  United  States”),  the  Termination  Letter  effectively  and \npractically  renders  meaningless  the  right  to  appeal,  which,  as \ndescribed in the Termination Letter, requires a written appeal to be \nsubmitted within 30 days containing a “brief statement of your \nargument and the disputed factual, legal, or other issues.”  (ECF No. \n1-2.) . . . .  A reasonable explanation considers relevant data and \narticulates  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the  agency’s  decision, \n“including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.”  Dep’t of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting State \nFarm,  463  U.S.  at  43).    The  Department  has  not  provided  a \nsatisfactory explanation of the facts found or the choice made, much \nless a rational connection between the two.  The Termination Letter \nfails to mention or refer to data or information the Department \nconsidered, if any, in deciding that the Grant Programs no longer \neffectuate Department priorities.  Further, the Department’s use of a \ntemplate or boilerplate letter issued to all Grant Recipients further \nstrengthens  Plaintiffs’  argument  that  the  Department  did  not \nconsider individual, or any, data or information.  California v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 \nWL 760825, at *3 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025) (finding the same \nTermination  Letter  “does  not  reach  the  level  of  a  reasoned \nexplanation; indeed it amounts to no explanation at all”). \n \n(ECF No. 32 at pp. 37–40.) \n  Defendants  continue  to  ignore  or  misapprehend  the  court’s  analysis  and  resultant \nconclusion that, by application of GEPA, with two exceptions not relevant here, the APA’s \nrulemaking carve-out for grant-related matters does not apply to the Department’s asserted agency \npriorities on which it based its termination of the Grant Awards through its Termination Letter.  \nThe court did not find, as Defendants say, that “all priorities are identical in the regulations just \nbecause they include the word ‘priorities.’”  (ECF No. 44 at p. 3.)  Defendants’ watered-down \nmisdescription of the court’s reasoned discussion and findings regarding the interplay between the \nGrant  Programs’  authorizing  statutes,  Department  regulations  (within  the  Code  of  Federal \nRegulations) to implement those statutes, GEPA, and the APA, does not serve its aim to persuade \nthe court that they are likely to succeed on appeal.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 5 of 10\nIn the same vein, the court has never purported to cabin the Secretary’s entitlement or \nability to change her priorities regarding broader “policy objectives.”  (ECF No. 44 at p. 4.)  Where \nsuch broader “policy objective” priorities are used as the premise to terminate Grant Awards, the \ncourt is (as it is here) tasked with redressing such termination if it runs afoul (as the court concluded \nit likely does here) of governing statutes and regulations.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (2025) \n(“The Federal award may be terminated in . . . its entirety . . . to the extent authorized by law, if an \naward no longer effectuates the . . . agency priorities.”).  Nothing in the court’s order at ECF No. \n33 prohibits, impairs, or limits Defendants’ ability, right, or entitlement to terminate Plaintiffs’ \nmembers’ Grant Awards provided any such termination is not undertaken or effected in a manner \nthe court determined is likely a violation of the APA.  \n  In the Motion, Defendants assert the Grant Programs’ authorizing statutes confer on the \nSecretary “significant discretion to allocate funds across grant applicants to best advance the \npurposes  of  the  programs”  and  “[n]othing  about  those  statutory  discretions  constrains  the \nSecretary’s discretion to determine how best to allocate funding for each program among many \ndifferent potential grant recipients.”  (ECF No. 44 at pp. 5–6.)  Defendants’ argument that the \nGrant Programs’ authorizing statutes commit allocating Grant Awards to the Secretary’s discretion \nignores not only GEPA, but also the undisputed fact that the Department uses notice and comment \nrulemaking to set priorities for selecting Grant Recipients.  See, e.g. ECF No. 24 at p. 26.  \nDefendants seem to argue that the authorizing statutes confer different levels of discretion for \nawarding funds and for terminating them, the former subject to the APA and the latter exempt \nfrom same.  Defendants identify no authority to support this contradiction; and it does not pass \nmuster.  Further, as the court previously explained, Defendants’ reliance on Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 \nU.S. 182 (1993), is unpersuasive as Lincoln is materially distinguishable from this case.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 6 of 10\nRegarding Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs’ Complaint is essentially a contract dispute, \nthe court incorporates its discussion of the non-application of the Tucker Act from its order of two \ndays ago.  (ECF No. 42 at pp. 4–11.)  It bears more than a passing mention that, at the hearing on \nthe preliminary injunction, Defendants’ counsel asserted her clients’ position as follows: “We \nbelieve this is a straightforward – I don’t know if anything is straightforward in this administration, \nbut it’s a straightforward APA case,” and “we have a final agency action, and now the question is \nwas that action arbitrary and capricious . . . .  It’s an APA case.”  (Preliminary Injunction Hearing \nTr. 58:23–25, 54:15–17.)  The court agreed then and agrees now.  The essence of Plaintiffs’ claim \nis the equitable relief sought; Plaintiffs ask this court to review the lawfulness of the Department’s \ntermination  decision,  a  decision  that  will  have  an  immediate  and  ongoing  impact  on  the \nrelationship between the parties, namely the Plaintiffs’ and their members’ Grant Award status.  \nSee ECF No. 42 at p. 6.   \nFurther,  the  court  was  wholly  unpersuaded  by  Defendants’  Emergency  Motion  for \nReconsideration (ECF No. 36) in which Defendants sought dismissal of the action on the basis of \ntwo arguments that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.  (ECF No. 42, \nMemorandum  Opinion  and  Order  on  Defendants’  Emergency  Motion  for  Reconsideration.)  \nNothing Defendants present in the instant Motion, or elsewhere, gives the court pause as to its \nproper subject matter jurisdiction over this action or as to the correctness of its determination on \nthe Motion for Preliminary Injunction, including the strength of Plaintiffs’ Winter factors showing.  \nIndeed, the court found that Plaintiffs plainly and without question met their burden on likelihood \nof success, as well as irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and public interest.  (ECF No. 32 \nat pp. 42–45.)  Therefore, Defendants do not meet their burden to persuade the court they are likely \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 7 of 10\nto succeed on the merits of their appeal of the court’s order at ECF No. 33 granting preliminary \ninjunctive relief (or the court’s denial of Defendants’ Emergency Motion for Reconsideration).   \nB.  Whether Defendants Will Be Irreparably Injured Absent a Stay \nThe preliminary injunction requires the Department (and others subject to the order) \nessentially to do what the court finds the law otherwise (already) requires of it and to return the \nparties to their respective status immediately prior to the likely unlawful termination of the Grant \nAwards  by  the  Department’s  Termination  Letter.    The  injunction  requires  nothing  of  the \nDepartment (or any Defendant) that the Department had not already committed to do in accordance \nwith its own regulations.  \nDefendants’ purported concerns over the Executive Branch’s authority are not compelling; \nthey mistake the point.  Defendants, in essence, purport to tee up a separation of powers question.  \nBut, no.  In fact, none exists.  The court’s order does not impair Defendants’ exercise of lawful \nauthority; and to the extent the Department wishes to terminate the Grant Awards, it may do so by \nlawful means as delineated by GEPA, the APA, and the Grant Award GANs.3  The Executive \nBranch’s authority does not carry with it the right to bypass statutory obligations set by Congress.  \nFor all such reasons, the court discerns no irreparable injury to Defendants absent a stay pending \nappeal.  \n \n \n \n3 For the same reasons, this court’s order does not, as a matter of fact or law, impair the Department or the Secretary’s \ncompliance with President Trump’s newest Executive Order titled Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering \nParents, States, and Communities (available online at https://perma.cc/22QL-8HVT) (last accessed March 21, 2025).  \nPresident Trump’s Executive Order requires that any action undertaken in compliance with, or to give life to, its \nstated Purpose and Policy (Section 1) be done “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law,” and \n“[c]onsistent with the Department of Education’s authorities;” and the President mandates that “this order shall \nbe implemented consistent with applicable law.”  Nothing about, or within, the Executive Order (expressly or by \nimplication) conflicts with, directs, encourages, or supports non-compliance with the court’s order at ECF No. 33. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 8 of 10\nC.  Whether a Stay Will Substantially Injure Plaintiffs and Public Interest \nAs the court recognized above, these factors “merge when the Government is the opposing \nparty.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Entry of a stay will produce immediate, \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs in precisely the ways the court identified in its memorandum opinion \nat ECF No. 33, because, here, a stay is the functional equivalent of denial of preliminary injunctive \nrelief, which the court found is necessary to avoid certain doom for Grant Recipient programs, and \nresultant/related harms to their affiliated teachers and administrators, and the communities they \nserve.   \nUntil this point, Defendants expressly conceded (in their papers and at oral argument) that \nPlaintiffs would experience irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  They now \nappear to retract that concession, arguing that “there is little to no evidence in the record regarding \nhow many months it would take before Plaintiffs begin to feel the impact of the lack of funding.”  \n(ECF No. 44 at p. 7.)  Apart from their inappropriate effort to generate a dispute on this point for \nthe first time in their Motion to stay the court’s order, Defendants’ position ignores the numerous \nundisputed attestations Plaintiffs offered in support of their preliminary injunction motion that \ndetail the many concrete harms their members will experience from the loss of their Grant Award \nfunding.  See, e.g., NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 14–15; AU Decl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., \nECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 13–14; Alder GSE Decl., ECF No. 5-8 ¶ 13; Teaching Lab Decl., ECF No. 5-9 ¶ \n19.   \nMoreover, Defendants’ present assertion is undermined by their own subsequent assertion \n(also in the Motion) that Plaintiffs’ members use their Grant Award funding for “purposes like \nsalaries and living wage stipends,” and they “would likely begin withdrawing immediately upon \ngrant reinstatement.”  (ECF No. 44 at p. 7.)  Defendants’ concession on irreparable harm just days \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 9 of 10\nago; followed by their current retraction of the concession; followed by, in the same breath, an \nassertion that undermines their retraction exposes the untenable nature of their argument.   \nFurther, as set forth at pages 44 and 45 of the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. 32: \nThe harms Plaintiffs identify also implicate grave effect on the \npublic: fewer teachers for students in high-need neighborhoods, \nearly childhood education, and special education programs. (AU \nDecl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., ECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 6, 14–15.) \nMoreover, even to the extent Defendants assert such an interest in \nending DEI-based programs, they have sought to effect change by \nmeans  the  court  finds  likely  violate  the  law.  “[T]he  public \n‘undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental institutions \nfollow the law.’” Vitkus v. Blinken, 79 F.4th 352, 368 (4th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 230–31). \n \nThe court reiterates that here.   \nFor the same reasons discussed at length in the court’s memorandum opinion at ECF No. \n32, Defendants’ arguments fail to persuade the court that the risk of substantial injury to Plaintiffs \nand the public interest favor a stay pending appeal. \nD.  Bond  \nDefendants also assert that the court’s imposition of a nominal bond was error.  (ECF No. \n44 at p. 8.)  As the court has previously addressed, at the hearing, defense counsel did not oppose \nPlaintiffs’ request that the court require no bond.  Then, Defendants retracted that concession too \n– by later filing a notice advising of their change of position and requesting bond in an amount \n“equal  to  the  Federal  Government’s  potential  costs  and  damages  from  a  wrongly  issued \ninjunction,”  per  President  Trump’s  March  11,  2025,  Executive  Order  titled  “Ensuring  the \nEnforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).”  (ECF Nos. 30, 30-1.)  The court examined \nthe issue as it is required to do, and determined that a nominal bond was warranted here based on \nthe cited authorities – authorities Defendants do not address in their Motion.  The court is not \npersuaded that the court’s issuance of a nominal bond was error, and Defendants offer no \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 45     Filed 03/21/25     Page 10 of 10\nsubstantive legal argument for the court to change its mind now.  This similarly does not favor \nentry of a stay pending appeal.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly, it is this 21st  day of March 2025: \nORDERED that the Motion (ECF No. 44) shall be, and is hereby, DENIED.  \n \n                /S/ \n     \n              Julie R.

Many of Plaintiffs’ members received grants \nfrom the Department through the Teacher Quality Partnership Program (“TQP”), the Supporting \nEffective  Educator  Development  Program  (“SEED”),  and  the  Teacher  and  School  Leader \nIncentive Program (“TSL”), which were used to fund programs to prepare and develop educators. \nWithout prior warning, and in reliance on the President’s recent Executive Order regarding DEI \ninitiatives,  the  Department  of  Education  recently  summarily  terminated  many  of  Plaintiffs’ \nmembers’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants. Not only were those terminations unlawful in reliance on \nExecutive Order 14151, the Department also failed to follow statute and Federal regulations in \nterminating the grants, making the terminations unlawful under the Administrative Procedures Act \ntoo. \nIn the years that the Department of Education held competitions to award TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants, the Department selected Priorities for applicants from a set of allowable agency \nPriorities enacted through a rulemaking process required by statute. These Priorities were used in \nthe competitions to award TQP, SEED, and TSL grants to AACTE’s and MACTE’s member \norganizations and to NCTR and its member organizations. Pursuant to statute and Department \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 3 of 39\n \n \nregulation, Priorities for any competitive grant program must generally be set by Congress or \nthrough notice and comment rulemaking by the Department.1 Only then can the final published \nagency Priorities apply to the competitive grant programs for selection of grantees in a particular \nfiscal year.  \nIn compliance with statute and its regulation, the Department followed the notice and \ncomment rulemaking process and established several Priorities that were allowable at the time the \nTQP, SEED, and TSL grants’ Notices for Inviting Applications at issue in this case were published \nin the Federal Register in 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The Department then awarded AACTE’s \nand MACTE’s member organizations and NCTR and its member organizations up to five-year \nTQP grants, up to three-year SEED grants, and/or up to three-year TSL grants that remained active \nthrough early to mid-February 2025. \nBut in February 2025, the Department summarily terminated grants awarded under TQP, \nSEED, and TSL. The purported basis provided by the Department for termination was that the \ngrants are “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], Department priorities.” In form letters \nsent along with the official termination notifications, the Department explained that:  \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education….the grant specified above provides \nfunding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives or \nother initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, \n \n1 While there are limited exceptions to this general rule, none of those exceptions are applicable here. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 4 of 39\n \n \ncolor,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another  protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil \nrights law; that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing \nmerit, fairness, and excellence in education; that are not free from \nfraud, abuse, or duplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best \ninterests of the United States. The grant is therefore inconsistent \nwith, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities. \n \nAfter terminating AACTE’s and MATCE’s member organizations’ and NCTR’s and its \nmember organizations’ TQP and SEED grants, the Department issued a press release titled “U.S. \nDepartment of Education Cuts $600 Million in Grants Used to Train Teachers and Education \nAgencies  on  Divisive  Ideologies.”  See  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-\ndepartment-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-divisive-teacher-training-grants.  \nNeither the Department’s “official” reason for terminating the grants, as articulated in the \nGrant Award Notifications regarding Department Priorities, nor its actual, publicly-articulated \nreason for termination regarding DEI initiatives, were lawful. The “official” justification is \nunlawful because the federal government has published a regulation governing the termination of \ngrants that the Department did not follow here. The Department’s publicly articulated reason for \nterminating the grants was unlawful because it was predicated on portions of an Executive Order \nthat has been enjoined by this Court.  \nThe Department’s stated reason relied, erroneously, on an implied change in “Department \npriorities.” Department Priorities,” however, is a term of art; they are not subject to whim or fiat \nand,  by  statute,  must  instead  be  established  through  notice  and  comment  rulemaking.  The \nDepartment Priorities applicable to Plaintiffs’ members’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants are the same \ntoday as they were when the grants were awarded because (a) no subsequent rulemaking has taken \nplace; and (b) the statutes that established Priorities allowable for TQP, SEED, and TSL have not \nbeen repealed or amended. Given that the Department Priorities have not changed, and the grants \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 5 of 39\n \n \nwere determined to meet the still-current Priorities during the competition process, it would be \narbitrary per se for the Department to conclude that these grants are not consistent with or do not \neffectuate those same “Department Priorities” now. \nAs a result of the Department’s improper early terminations, the Grant Recipients have \nbeen and will continue to be deprived of essential funding required to continue their teacher \npreparation  programs  and  the  continuation  of  the  Department’s  unlawful  terminations  will \nirreparably harm Plaintiffs and their members. As such, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nCourt award relief to address the irreparable harm that continues to result from Defendants’ \nunlawful actions.  \nIn support of their claims, Plaintiffs further aver as follows: \n1.  The Supporting Effective Educator Development Program, authorized by Congress \nunder section 2242 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 \nU.S.C. § 6672), provides funding to increase the number of highly effective educators in the United \nStates by supporting the implementation of evidence-based practices that prepare, develop, or \nenhance the skills of educators. SEED was authorized in statute to support educators’ development \nacross the continuum of their careers and requires the Secretary of the Department of Education to \naward grants to eligible entities for the purpose of:  \n(1) providing teachers, principals, or other school leaders from nontraditional \npreparation  and  certification  routes  or  pathways  to  serve  in  traditionally \nunderserved local educational agencies; \n \n(2)  providing  evidence-based  professional  development  activities  that  address \nliteracy, numeracy, remedial, or other needs of local educational agencies and the \nstudents the agencies serve; \n \n(3)  providing  teachers,  principals,  or  other  school  leaders  with  professional \ndevelopment activities that enhance or enable the provision of postsecondary \ncoursework through dual or concurrent enrollment programs and early college high \nschool settings across a local educational agency; \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 6 of 39\n \n \n \n(4) making freely available services and learning opportunities to local educational \nagencies,  through  partnerships  and  cooperative  agreements  or  by  making  the \nservices or opportunities publicly accessible through electronic means; or \n \n(5) providing teachers, principals, or other school leaders with evidence-based \nprofessional enhancement activities, which may include activities that lead to an \nadvanced credential. \n20 U.S.C. § 6672(a). \n2.  The Teacher Quality Partnership Grant Program, authorized by section 202 of the \nHigher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 1022), provides funding to eligible \npartnerships to improve student achievement; improve the quality of prospective and new teachers \nby improving the preparation of prospective teachers and enhancing professional development \nactivities for new teachers; hold teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education \naccountable  for  preparing  teachers  who  meet  applicable  State  certification  and  licensure \nrequirements;  and  recruit  highly  qualified  individuals,  including  individuals  of  color  and \nindividuals from other occupations, into the teaching force. TQP funds teacher preparation \nprograms at the pre-baccalaureate or “fifth-year” level, and teaching residency programs for \nindividuals new to teaching, or mid-career professionals from outside the field of education, with \nstrong academic and professional backgrounds.  \n3.  The Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program, authorized by section 2212 of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 6632), serves \neducators in high-need schools who raise student academic achievement and close the achievement \ngap between high- and low-performing students. TSL helps develop, implement, improve, or \nexpand comprehensive performance-based compensation systems or human capital management \nsystems for teachers, principals, or other school leaders. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 7 of 39\n \n \n4.  Plaintiff AACTE’s and MACTE’s member organizations and Plaintiff NCTR and \nits member organizations (the “Grant Recipients”) receive TQP, SEED, and/or TSL funding \nthrough grants awarded by the Department of Education. Specifically, the Grant Recipients were \nawarded up to five-year TQP grants through the FY 2020 TQP competition, FY 2022 TQP \ncompetition, and FY 2024 TQP competition, up to three-year SEED grants through the FY 2022 \nSEED competition, and up to three-year TSL grants though the FY 2023 TSL competition.  \n5.  In February 2025, the majority of the Grant Recipients received updated Grant \nAward Notifications and form letters from the Department (“Termination Letters”) terminating \ntheir TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.2 True and correct representative copies of the Grant Award \nNotifications are attached as Exhibit A. True and correct representative copies of the Termination \nLetters are attached as Exhibit B.  \n6.  All of the Grant Recipients are similarly situated because the substance of each \nTermination Letter and added terms and conditions in the Grant Award Notifications from the \nDepartment are identical, indicating the same reasons with the same terminology for the grant \nterminations. See Exhibits A, B. \n7.  In terminating the Grant Recipients’ TQP, SEED, and TSL grants in their entirety, \neffective the same day as the termination letters were sent/dated, the updated Grant Award \nNotifications  provided  the  following  reason  for  termination:  “The  grant  is  deemed  to  be \ninconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.” (Exhibit A at pages 4, 10, 16, \n22, 28, 34, 40). The Termination Letter articulated the same reason along with additional language \nregarding DEI initiatives: \nThe grant specified above provides funding for programs that promote or \ntake part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate \n \n2 While the Department terminated the majority of the Grant Recipients’ grants, some of Plaintiffs’ member \norganizations did not have their TQP grants terminated yet.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 8 of 39\n \n \non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights \nlaw;  that  conflict  with  the  Department’s  policy  of  prioritizing  merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United \nStates.  The  grant  is  therefore  inconsistent  with,  and  no  longer \neffectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see also \n34 C.F.R. § 75.253. Therefore, pursuant to, among other authorities, 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.339-43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the termination provisions in \nyour grant award, the Department hereby terminates grant No. [] in its \nentirety effective 2/[]/25. \nExhibit B at pages 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 (emphasis added). \n8.  The Department’s articulated basis for terminating the grants and denying access \nto the funds is contrary to statute and regulations, and the immediate termination constitutes final \nagency action that is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”). \n9.  The Grant Recipients offer programs to provide supports to improve the quality of \nteaching and school leadership. The unlawful termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants will \nforce the immediate closure of many of these programs and irreparably harm the Grant Recipients \nand the educators, students, and communities they serve. Plaintiffs thus bring this action to enjoin \nDefendants from terminating the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the claims arise \nunder  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and because \nDefendants are United States officials, see 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). This Court may issue a \ndeclaratory judgment and further relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.  \n11.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), (e)(1), because \nDefendants are agencies of the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 9 of 39\n \n \ncapacity, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this \nDistrict, and Plaintiff MACTE resides in this district. \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education is a nonprofit \nassociation of educator preparation programs, comprised of hundreds of public and private \ncolleges and universities and nonprofit organizations.3 AACTE’s member organizations prepare \nprofessional  educators  across  the  United  States  and  its  territories,  encompassing  teachers, \ncounselors, PK-12 administrators, and college faculty. AACTE’s mission is to elevate education \nand educator preparation through research, professional practice, advocacy, and collaboration. The \ntermination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants directly threatens this mission. These grants fund \ninitiatives  that  benefit  PK-12  students  and  schools  nationwide  by  supporting  innovative \napproaches to educator preparation and professional development. Through their work, grantees \nproduce  evidence-based  practices  that  lead  to  the  preparation  of  highly  qualified  teachers, \nprincipals, and school-based educators. As the nation’s largest organization dedicated to educator \npreparation, AACTE prioritizes ensuring that every child has access to credentialed, well-prepared \neducators. These grants are vital to that goal. AACTE plays a crucial role in amplifying their \nimpact by sharing grantees’ research, policy insights, and best practices with the broader education \ncommunity through publications, convenings, annual meetings, and other resources. Preserving \nthese funding sources is essential to sustaining and advancing the quality of educator preparation \nand, ultimately, student success. AACTE’s principal place of business is 1602 L St., NW, Suite \n601, Washington, DC 20036. \n \n3 AACTE’s member organizations can be found at https://aacte.org/membership/our-members/.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 10 of 39\n \n \n13.  Plaintiff The National Center for Teacher Residencies supports the design of new \nteacher residency programs and provides consulting to strengthen existing programs across the \nUnited States. NCTR is comprised of dozens of network members, including colleges, universities, \nand nonprofit teaching organizations.4 NCTR’s mission is to transform educator preparation by \nadvancing the teacher residency movement to prepare, support, and retain more effective educators \nwho represent and value the communities they serve. The termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL \ngrants implicates NCTR’s core mission because it removes the financial supports needed to reduce \ntuition costs for aspiring teachers called teacher residents, pay host K-12 teachers for the work \nthey are doing to support the aspiring teachers, offset the cost for licensure examinations and test \nprep workshops, and provide a stipend or pay for work the teacher residents are completing through \ntheir internships. Without these necessary supports, teacher residencies will be unable to continue \nto lower the financial barrier to becoming a teacher and ensure the necessary comprehensive \npreparation is provided to prepare future teachers. NCTR’s principal place of business is 1332 N. \nHalsted Street, Suite 304 Chicago, IL 60642. \n14.  Plaintiff  the  Maryland  Association  of  Colleges  for  Teacher  Education  is  a \nmembership organization with a mission to serve as a distinct statewide voice on matters of \nimportance to educator preparation programs at Maryland’s colleges and universities. AACTE and \nMACTE collaborate to strengthen their advocacy efforts, share experience and expertise, and \nexpand their members’ professional development opportunities. MACTE’s members include \nregionally accredited colleges and universities engaged in the preparation of professional school \npersonnel  with  state  program  approval.  In  addition  to  hosting  regular  professional  learning \nactivities,  MACTE  serves  on  the  Council  of  Educational,  Administrative  and  Supervisory \n \n4 NCTR’s member organizations can be found at https://nctresidencies.org/nctr-network/members/. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 11 of 39\n \n \nOrganizations of Maryland Leadership Team, nominates three representatives to serve on the \nProfessional  Standards  and  Teacher  Education  Board,  and  represents  Maryland  preparation \nprograms at AACTE. The termination of the TQP and SEED grants implicates MACTE’s core \nmission. MACTE serves the institutions of higher education in Maryland for both the recruitment \nand retention of future teachers as well as the support and advancement of current classroom \nteachers. Both the TQP and SEED grants were focused on recruitment, retention of future teachers \nas well as the support of practicing teachers in Maryland.

In 2008, Congress authorized TQP to support high-quality teacher preparation and \nprofessional  development  for  prospective  teachers  and  school  leaders.  In  2015,  Congress \nauthorized  SEED  to  increase  the  number  of  highly  effective  educators  by  supporting  the \nimplementation  of  evidence-based  practices  that  prepare,  develop,  or  enhance  the  skills  of \nteachers, principals, or other school leaders. Also in 2015, Congress authorized TSL to assist local \neducational agencies and nonprofit organizations to develop, implement, improve, or expand \ncomprehensive performance-based compensation systems or human capital management systems \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 12 of 39\n \n \nfor teachers, principals, or other school leaders, especially for teachers, principals, or other school \nleaders in high-need schools who raise student growth and academic achievement and close the \nachievement gap between high- and low-performing students. \n19.  Congress directed the Secretary of the Department of Education to award grants, \non a competitive basis, to eligible entities to provide funding consistent with the goals of TQP (20 \nU.S.C. § 1022a(a)), SEED (20 U.S.C. § 6672(a)), and TSL (20 U.S.C. § 6632(a)).  \n20.  Federal regulations govern the procedures and the basis by which a Federal agency, \nsuch as the Department of Education, may terminate a Federal award. See 85 F.R. 49506-49582. \nA Federal award may be terminated by the Federal agency or pass-through entity if an award no \nlonger effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2) (2020); see \nalso 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (2024).  \n21.  The  Secretary  of  Education  (the  “Secretary”)  is  required  to  publish  agency \nPriorities in the Federal Register, which must be used to select the Priorities for a competition and \nmust have gone through public comment, unless one of the following exceptions apply:  \n(i) The final annual priorities will be implemented only by inviting applications that \nmeet the priorities; \n \n(ii) The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of priorities already established \nin the program’s regulations; \n \n(iii) Publishing proposed annual priorities would seriously interfere with an orderly, \nresponsible grant award process or would otherwise be impracticable, unnecessary, \nor contrary to the public interest; \n \n(iv) The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to establish specified \npriorities; or \n \n(v) The annual priorities are chosen from allowable activities specified in the \nprogram statute. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2); 20 USC § 1232(d).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 13 of 39\n \n \n22.  The Secretary is likewise required to establish the specific Priorities that are \nincluded in the application for each competitive federal grant program, such as TQP, SEED, and \nTSL, by publishing the Priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal \nRegister. (34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1)).  \n23.  As a federal agency, the Department is unique in the statutory requirement it has to \nfollow for setting agency Priorities for discretionary grants. While the APA (5 U.S.C. § 553) \nexempts grants from the rulemaking process, the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(d)) (“GEPA”) states that, for the Department of Education, the grants exemption for \nrulemaking only applies to regulations (1) that govern the first grant competition under a new or \nsubstantially revised program authority as determined by the Secretary; or (2) where the Secretary \ndetermines rulemaking will cause extreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries of the program. \n24.  In other words, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department \nmust go through the notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the above exceptions \napply.  \nII.  Department of Education Priorities Applicable to the Now-Terminated TQP, SEED, \nand TSL Grants. \n25.  After  going  through  the  proper  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  process,  the \nDepartment published a Notice of Final Priority for discretionary grant programs in the Federal \nRegister on November 27, 2019. (84 F.R. 65300-65303).5 Also after following the required notice \nand comment rulemaking process, the Department published a Notice of Final Priorities for all \ndiscretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020.6 (85 F.R. 13640-13644). \n \n5 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on July 29, \n2019. (84 F.R. 36504-36507). \n \n6 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on November \n29, 2019. (84 F.R. 65734-65739). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 14 of 39\n \n \n26.  Then, after going through the proper notice and comment rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published its Notice of Final Priorities for TQP, SEED, and TSL grant competitions \nin the Federal Register on July 9, 2021.7 The final Priorities consisted of: Priority 1—Supporting \nEducators and Their Professional Growth; and Priority 2—Increasing Educator Diversity. (86 F.R. \n36217-36220). \n27.  On July 9, 2021, after going through the proper notice and comment rulemaking \nprocess, the Department published a Notice of Final Priority for TSL.8 The Priority was for “High-\nNeed Schools.” (86 F.R. 36220-36222). \n28.  After  following  the  required  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  process,  the \nDepartment of Education published a Notice of Final Priorities for the Secretary’s Supplemental \nPriorities for all discretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on December 10, 2021.9 The \nfinal supplemental Priorities consisted of the following: Priority 1—Addressing the Impact of \nCOVID-19 on Students, Educators, and Faculty; Priority 2—Promoting Equity in Student Access \nto  Educational  Resources  and  Opportunities;  Priority  3—Supporting  a  Diverse  Educator \nWorkforce and Professional Growth To Strengthen Student Learning; Priority 4—Meeting Student \nSocial, Emotional, and Academic Needs; Priority 5—Increasing Postsecondary Education Access, \nAffordability, Completion, and Post-Enrollment Success; and Priority 6—Strengthening Cross-\nAgency Coordination and Community Engagement To Advance Systemic Change. (86 F.R. \n70612-70641).  \n \n7 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on April 20, \n2021. (86 F.R. 20471-20475). \n \n8 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priority for public comment on April 9, \n2021. (86 F.R. 18519-18523). \n \n9 The Department of Education published a Notice of Proposed Priorities for public comment on June 30, \n2021. (86 F.R. 34664-34674). \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 15 of 39\n \n \nIII.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2020, FY 2022, and FY 2024 TQP Grants.  \n29.  On May 18, 2020, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the \nFY 2020 TQP competition inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (85 F.R. 29691-29704). \nIn addition, on February 25, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for \nthe FY 2022 TQP competition inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (87 F.R. 10906-\n10923). The Department similarly published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY 2024 TQP \ncompetition on April 4, 2024. (89 F.R. 23573-23592). \n30.  The project period for the FY 2020, FY 2022, and FY 2024 TQP competitions (the \nmaximum amount of time for which the grants can be awarded) was up to five years. (85 F.R. \n29699, 87 F.R. 10918, 89 F.R. 23587). \n31.  All three TQP grant competitions included Priorities that were established through \nthe required notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified \nin TQP’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 1022).  \n32.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2020  TQP \ncompetition for up to a five-year period. \n33.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2022  TQP \ncompetition for up to a five-year period. \n34.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2024  TQP \ncompetition for up to a five-year period.  \nIV.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2022 SEED Grants.  \n35.   On April 4, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the \nFY 2022 SEED competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (87 F.R. 19487-\n19496).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 16 of 39\n \n \n36.  The project period for the FY 2022 SEED competition was up to three years. (87 \nF.R. 19492). \n37.  The SEED grant competition included Priorities that were established through the \nrequired notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified in \nSEED’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 6672). \n38.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2022  SEED \ncompetition for up to a three-year period.  \nV.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY 2023 TSL Grants.  \n39.   On May 24, 2023, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for the \nFY 2023 TSL competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. (88 F.R. 33592-33601).  \n40.  The project period for the FY 2023 TSL competition was up to three years. (88 F.R. \n33598). \n41.  The TSL grant competition included Priorities that were established through the \nrequired notice and comment rulemaking process or chosen from allowable activities specified in \nTSL’s authorizing statute (20 U.S.C. § 6632). \n42.  Grant  Recipients  were  selected  to  receive  funding  from  the  FY  2023  TSL \ncompetition for up to a three-year period.  \nVI.  The Department’s Decision to Terminate the TQP, SEED, and TSL Grants. \n43.  In February 2025, the Department sent Termination Letters and updated Grant \nAward Notifications to Grant Recipients, informing them that their TQP, SEED, and TSL grants \nwere terminated. The termination of the grants was effective “in [their] entirety” immediately. See \nExhibits A, B. \n44.  The  only  stated  reason  for  the  termination  of  the  grants  was  that  they  are \n“inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], the Department priorities.” See id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 17 of 39\n \n \nVII.  The Preliminary Injunction Granted in NADOHE et al. v. Trump et al. Prohibits the \nDepartment from Enforcing the Termination of the Grants. \n45.  On February 21, 2025, this Court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the \nPresident’s administration from enforcing certain provisions of Executive Order 14151, Ending \nRadical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, Executive Order of January \n20, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) (the “J20 Order”), and Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, Executive Order of January 21, \n2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (“J21 Order”). National Association of Diversity Officers \nin Higher Education, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 \n(D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025) (the “NADOHE Order”). A true and correct copy of the NADOHE Order \nis attached as Exhibit C. \n46.  In relevant part, the NADOHE Order enjoins the President’s administration from \nenforcing a provision in Executive Order 14151 requiring “[e]ach agency, department, . . . [to] \ntake the following actions within sixty days of this order: (i) terminate, to the maximum extent \nallowed by law, . . . all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts” (the “Termination Provision”).  \n47.  In granting the preliminary injunction, the Court held that the plaintiffs showed a \nlikelihood of success on their claim that the Termination Provision is void for vagueness under the \nFifth Amendment. \n48.  While the Grant Award Notification and Termination Letters did not reference \nExecutive Order 14151 as the reason for terminating the grants, the Department released a press \nrelease on February 17, 2025 that makes clear that the grant terminations at issue in this lawsuit \nwere pursuant to the Termination Provision in Executive Order 14151 requiring the Department \nto terminate “equity-related” grants or contracts. A true and correct copy of the press release is \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 18 of 39\n \n \nattached as Exhibit D.10 The press release explains that the grants were terminated because they \nwere using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education agencies on divisive ideologies, such as \n“Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and “equity training”– the same directive of the Termination \nProvision. See id.  \n49.  The Termination Letters likewise reference the Department’s position to “ensure[] \nthat the Department’s grants do not support programs or organizations that promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives[.]” (Exhibit B at pages 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13).  \n50.  While the Grant Award Notifications and Termination Letters state that the grants \nwere terminated because they were “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[], Department \npriorities,” it is clear from the Government’s conduct that the grants were terminated pursuant to \nthe now-enjoined Termination Provision. \n51.  The NADOHE Order benefits not just the named plaintiffs in that action, but all \ncontractors and grantees who were subjected to the Termination Provision. NADOHE v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764 at *28-29.  \n52.  As  such,  this  Court’s  NADOHE  Order  covers,  and  forbids,  the  continued \nenforcement of the termination of the grants at issue in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek relief directing \nthe Department to return the Grant Awardees to the status quo ante with respect to Executive Order \n14151 and rescind the termination of their TQP, SEED, and TSL grants. \n \n10  See  https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-\ndivisive-teacher-training-grants. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 19 of 39\n \n \nVIII.  The  Department’s  Termination  of  the  Grants  also  Violates  the  Administrative \nProcedures Act (“APA”). \n \n53.  Even if the Department’s termination of the grants at issue in this lawsuit were not \ngoverned by the NADOHE Order, the terminations were unlawful because they constituted an \nunlawful, arbitrary, and capricious action that violates the APA. \n54.  Statute and regulation require the Secretary to publish Department Priorities for \nprogram grants in the Federal Register, subject to a notice and comment period. (20 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(d), 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2)). The Secretary then selects allowable Priorities to include in \nthe applications which are published in the Federal Register. (34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)). \n55.  The proffered reason by the Department for the termination of the grants because \nthey “are inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities,” is contrary to statute \nand regulation and arbitrary and capricious.  \n56.  The Department cannot, by law, determine that with a change in administration, \nspecific Department Priorities for grant programs are no longer allowable unless and until the \nDepartment  engages  in  rulemaking  to  propose  and  issue  new  Final  Priorities.  The  present \nadministration has not done that, so the current Priorities remain Department Priorities. \n57.  The Department Priorities for the grants that were awarded from the respective \ncompetitions  were  lawfully  selected  for,  and  articulated  in,  the  published  Notices  Inviting \nApplications in 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024 pursuant to program statutes or after the proper notice \nand comment rulemaking process.  \n58.  As a result, and contrary to the Department’s official reasons, the grants at issue are \nconsistent with the current Department Priorities. If the Department wishes to establish new \nDepartment Priorities, it may do so only through the means established by statute and regulation, \nnot through whim or fiat.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 20 of 39\n \n \nIX.  Effect of Termination on Plaintiffs and Their Member Organizations. \n59.  As of the date of the Termination Letters, all funding from the grants has been \nhalted and the Grant Recipients are no longer receiving any funds from the Department under the \ngrants they were awarded under TQP, SEED, and TSL.  \n60.  Without the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants, Grant Recipients are unable to continue \nfunding their work.  \n61.  The loss of funding is an economic harm so great that it threatens the very existence \nof Plaintiffs’ members’ teacher preparation programs. \n62.  The TQP, SEED, and TSL grants together fund hundreds of teacher preparation \nprograms in the United States, and the termination en masse of these grants threatens the system \nthat prepares our nation’s teaching workforce.  \n63.  The harm to Plaintiffs and their member organizations from the terminations has \nbeen severe, and a continuation of the harm is certain and irreparable. \n64.  The following represent just a few of many examples of the harm to Plaintiffs and \ntheir member organizations caused by the Department’s termination of the Grant Recipients’ TQP, \nSEED, and TSL grants: \nA.  Plaintiff NCTR  \n65.  Plaintiff NCTR has been and will continue to be substantially and irreparably \nharmed by the Department’s grant terminations. Plaintiff NCTR was awarded a three-year SEED \ngrant in 2022. \n66.  NCTR’s SEED grant funded thirteen teacher residency programs spanning five \nstates.  The  teacher  residency  programs  consist  of  partnerships  between  higher  education \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 21 of 39\n \n \ninstitutions and K-12 school districts in traditional public and charter schools located in rural, \nsuburban, and urban areas.  \n67.  The teacher residency programs provide financial support to their participants in \nthe following ways: tuition support, living expense stipends, tutoring in licensing examinations, \nand emergency funds. The programs also provide mentorship, intensive training and professional \ndevelopment, and summer institutes for mentor teachers.  \n68.  Plaintiff NCTR’s SEED grant is also used to fund a cross-organizational (twelve \nresidency programs) collaborative effort to create and field-test a coherent and aligned vision of \nmentoring excellence and collective responsibility. One of the goals of the grant funds was to \ncomplete a study of attainable metrics to evaluate mentor teacher impacts on resident learning.  \n69.  Plaintiff NCTR’s SEED grant was terminated in its third year.  \n70.  The  termination  of  the  SEED  grant  will  result  in  a  $1,188,070  overall  loss, \nincluding a $332,000 direct loss to the grant winning organization, as well as a loss of $360,000 \nin expenses to contractors and a $495,000 loss in subgrants to the thirteen teacher residency \nprograms. \n71.  This $495,000 loss in subgrants will have an adverse impact on the thirteen teacher \nresidency programs, and will directly lead to staff cuts at a number of those institutions. In addition, \nthe grant termination directly affects the 128 teacher residents currently enrolled in the thirteen \nprograms as part of the 2024-25 school year and will also impact the ability of those thirteen \nprograms to enroll the projected 190 teacher residents who plan to begin their residency year this \nsummer 2025. With the termination of the grant, some of the thirteen teacher residency programs \nwill be forced to close. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 22 of 39\n \n \n72.  Programs intended to use subgrant funds to provide tuition relief and stipends for \nboth groups of teacher residents, which would total over 300 teacher residents. This will no longer \nbe possible with the termination of the grant. \n73.  The termination of the grant will also directly affect at least 7,500 K-12 students \nacross the five states.  \n74.  In addition, with the grant’s termination, the study of the mentor teacher impact and \nteacher resident learning will not be completed, depriving Plaintiff NCTR of its capacity to engage \nin core mission-driven activities, such as publishing about the most promising practices for \ndeveloping skilled, experienced teachers into impactful mentors of new teacher residents. \n75.  Furthermore,  without  its  ability  to  continue  these  thirteen  teacher  residency \nprograms due to the loss of grant funding, Plaintiff NCTR is deprived of its ability to serve the K-\n12 school districts where there is high turnover and shortages of teachers and prepare educators \nfor careers to help mitigate these teacher shortages. \n76.  These harms prevent NCTR from engaging in the core activities compelled by its \nmission and reason for existence. \nB.  AACTE Member Organization - American University  \n77.  American University (“AU”) is a member organization of Plaintiff AACTE that \nhas been and will continue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the Department’s grant \nterminations. AU is in the second year of a five-year TQP grant. \n78.  AU’s  TQP  grant  funds  a  teacher  preparation  program  for  special  education \n(learning disabilities) and early childhood education, the Residency for Excellence in Teaching \nand Learning (“RETL”). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 23 of 39\n \n \n79.  RETL is a partnership between AU’s School of Education and its charter network, \nWashington D.C. Friendship Public Charter Schools, consisting of five charter campuses. The \npurpose of the partnership is to provide a pathway for educator development to address critical \nareas of need, including early childhood education and special education,11 and recruit highly \nmotivated preservice teacher candidates who are committed to teaching in diverse early childhood \nand special education settings (pre-K through grade five).  \n80.  The partnership enables participants to complete a residency-based master’s degree \nwith an initial teaching license in Early Childhood Education or Special Education - Learning \nDisabilities. In addition to earning their Masters of Arts in Teaching degree, program participants \nreceive comprehensive coaching, professional development, and ongoing support during the \nentirety of the three-year program -the residency year (the first year) and the induction years (the \nsecond and third year). \n81.  RETL supports pathways in high-need teaching areas of early childhood education \nand special education, specifically targeting urban and underserved geographic areas with their \npartner charter network. RETL services five Friendship Public Charter campuses.  \n82.  RETL provides a living stipend to participants and reduced tuition (by roughly 35% \nof the AU graduate tuition rate) to one of two AU’s School of Education’s Master of Arts in \nTeaching degrees, Special Education in Learning Disabilities and Early Childhood Education.  \n83.  AU was in its second year of RETL when the Department terminated the grant, \nwith eight students who are expected to graduate from AU in December 2025. With the funding \nfrom the TQP grant, AU planned to recruit an additional forty participants. As a result of the loss \n \n11 Washington D.C. is in need of educators for special education to serve students with disabilities. See \nhttps://specialedcoop.org/news-articles/the-state-of-special-education-in-the-district-of-columbia/, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/27/dc-students-disabilities-urgent-reform/. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 24 of 39\n \n \nof funding from the terminated TQP grant, AU will no longer be able to recruit future cohorts. As \na result, forty-eight future RETL participants who would have had the opportunity to earn a Master \nof Arts in Teaching degree and deepen their expertise and longevity as teachers in Washington \nD.C. will no longer have that opportunity.  \n84.  The termination of the TQP grant will halt AU’s efforts to remedy dramatic teacher \nshortages and improve outcomes for early childhood and special education students in Washington \nD.C. Up to 1,500 Washington D.C. students will be impacted by the termination of the grant, in \naddition to the educators at the charter school partners. \n85.  In addition, AU planned to expand to at least two additional charter schools in the \nremaining years of the TQP grant. As a result of the Department’s termination of AU’s grant, there \nis no opportunity for additional students and educators to be served. \n86.  The  termination  of  the  TQP  grant  will  also  result  in  AU  terminating  the \nemployment of its full-time coach/program director. \n87.  If funding through the TQP grant is not reinstated, the RETL program will be forced \nto close. \n88.  These harms prevent AU/RETL from engaging in the core activities compelled by \ntheir missions and reason for existence.  \nC.  AACTE Member Organization – University of St. Thomas  \n89.  The University of St. Thomas (“UST”) is a member organization of Plaintiff \nAACTE that has been and will continue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the \nDepartment’s grant terminations. UST is in the second year of a three-year SEED grant and the \nfifth year of a five-year TQP grant.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 25 of 39\n \n \n90.  The UST SEED grant funds three pathway models to a career in education: (1) a \nresidency program for graduate students in partnership with St. Paul Public Schools, Minneapolis \nPublic Schools, and a consortium of charter schools; (2) a “work and learn” program for graduate \nstudents in partnership with schools throughout the state of Minnesota where paraprofessionals \nand teachers are employed while completing their teacher preparation program; and (3) an \nundergraduate program which prepares undergraduate students for educational careers in their \njunior and senior years at UST.  \n91.  The SEED grant provides funds of up to $20,000 per year for graduate students and \nup to $40,000 per year to undergraduate students who are pursuing teacher licensure in special \neducation and elementary education.  \n92.  UST is currently in year two of the three year SEED grant. In year two, the grant \nwas set to fund over 300 scholarships to future educators over the three year grant period, most of \nwhom  were  preparing  to  be  special  education  teachers,  for  approximately  $2,000,000. \nScholarships for fall and spring semester were disbursed to students prior to the grant termination. \nHowever, without access to the SEED grant funds, UST can no longer provide summer funding to \nthe majority of these future educators. As a result, many of the future educators may not be able \nto afford the schooling required to continue their path to becoming teachers.  \n93.  Year three of the SEED grant was set to fund scholarships in the amount of \n$2,200,000; termination of the grants will result in a loss of all of these scholarships. In addition, \ntermination of the SEED grants will result in a loss of funding for mentor teachers for professional \ndevelopment.  \n94.  To date, nearly 80 communities across the state of Minnesota have been taught by \nteachers who received SEED scholarship funds, including schools in rural, urban, suburban, and \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 26 of 39\n \n \nexurban communities. Without continued SEED funding, the teacher pipeline program at UST will \ngraduate fewer students capable of serving in high-needs areas such as special education, which \nwill have widespread negative impacts on the many communities, teachers and students these \nteacher pipeline programs benefit. \n95.  UST’s TQP grant removes financial barriers to careers in education by providing \nfunding for UST to partner with charter schools to provide living wage stipends to student teaching \nresidents preparing to become licensed educators. UST is in year five of this TQP grant, and at \npresent, 21 student teaching residents are in the middle of their second semester of student \nteaching. Collectively, the student teaching residents were set to receive $819,000 for stipends (the \nfirst half of which has already been paid), however, the termination of the TQP grant will put the \nliving-expense stipends for these students at risk.  \n96.  These harms interfere with UST’s ability to serve its students, and through them, to \nserve the community and fulfill its mission to advance the common good.  \nD.  NCTR and AACTE Member Organization – Alder Graduate School of \nEducation  \n97.  Alder Graduate School of Education (“Alder GSE”) is a member organization of \nPlaintiff NCTR and Plaintiff AACTE that has been and will continue to be substantially and \nirreparably harmed by the Department’s grant terminations. Alder GSE was awarded a five-year \nTQP grant in 2020, as well as a five-year TQP grant in 2022.  \n98.  Both of Alder GSE’s TQP grants fund teacher residency programs. \n99.  The teacher residency programs consist of partnerships between Alder GSE and \npartner K-12 school systems, including public school districts and a Special Education Planning \nArea, to operate community-based workforce development pathways for aspiring teachers.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 27 of 39\n \n \n100.  Alder GSE and its partner K-12 school systems recruit and prepare community \nmembers through a one-year teacher residency program, where candidates co-teach with a highly \nqualified mentor teacher while earning their Master’s degree and teaching credential. They are \noften hired immediately upon completion of the program, most often by the school systems where \nthey trained. \n101.  The 2020 TQP grant’s goals are: (i) launch and scale a new and sustainable \nresidency program with three partner local education agency that meets local human capital needs; \n(ii) train, support and retain effective new teachers in schools with high concentrations of high \nneed students; and (iii) demonstrate the capacity of partners to scale, sustain, and replicate teacher \nresidency and development model. The 2022 TQP grant’s goals are: (i) build a pipeline of high-\nquality and diverse teachers in partnership with high-need local education agencies that effectively \nmeets their human capital needs and certification shortage areas; (ii) promote equity, strengthen \nstudent learning, and meet the social, emotional, and academic needs of students by modeling for \nand by building the capacity of mentors and residents to use evidence based practices and to create \npositive and inclusive learning environments; and (iii) increase impact by building capacity, \nsustainability and scale of the partnership and high-leverage strategies. \n102.  The termination of the grants has had and will continue to have immense impacts \non the aspiring teacher candidates, mentor teachers, the partner K-12 school systems, and Alder \nGSE. \n103.  For the 2024-2025 academic year, the teacher residency programs have 83 aspiring \nteacher candidates who were receiving a living stipend supplemented by the funds from the TQP \ngrants. The teaching candidates depend on these stipends to live, eat, and support their families – \nfor  most  they  are  their  only  source  of  income.  The  teaching  candidates  signed  Letters  of \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 28 of 39\n \n \nCommitment before June 2024, with the expectation of a level of stipend for the entirety of the \nschool year. The teacher residency programs also presently have 83 mentor teachers who receive \na stipend funded by grant funds for their work in support of their efforts to train and develop new \nteachers. With the termination of the grants, the 83 aspiring teacher candidates and 83 mentor \nteachers will no longer receive the level of stipends they were promised. \n104.  Alder GSE has already recruited 40 new teacher candidates for the 2025-2026 \nacademic year and K-12 school systems had planned to provide the living stipends – the majority \nof which were planned to be supplemented with TQP grant funds. Alder GSE recruited the majority \nof these residents with the expectation of a level of funding for their living stipend that was \nsupplemented by the grant funding. The majority of these residents are enrolled, have signed letters \nof commitment, or are in final rounds of interviews/admissions. The financial impact of the grants’ \ntermination  will  affect  many  of  their  decisions  to  become  teachers.  Similarly,  the  grants’ \ntermination affects the stipend funding levels for mentors, which will have an impact on their \ndecision to continue with the role. \n105.  Alder GSE similarly planned to recruit 40 new teacher candidates and 40 new \nmentors for the 2026-2027 academic year, however, with the loss in grant funds, it will be more \ndifficult for Alder GSE to recruit and prepare these future prospective candidates. \n106.  The termination of the 2020 and 2022 TQP grants has caused and will continue to \ncause harm to the partner K-12 school systems as well. They are at risk of losing the teacher \ncandidates who taught in their schools, which will have a negative impact on the school and its \ncommunity. Alder GSE expects about $2.1 million of lost funding for their partner K-12 school \nsystems. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 29 of 39\n \n \n107.  There were also a number of programmatic roles at Alder GSE that were partially \nsupported by these TQP grants. These roles were supporting operation of these partnerships and \nthese  residency  programs  -  including  recruitment,  admissions,  enrollment,  student  services, \nfinancial support, data and impact, academic programs, and clinical programs. Alder GSE expects \nabout $2.2 million of lost funding supporting Alder GSE costs to support these partnerships and \nresidency programs. \n108.  Additionally,  the  terminations  will  cause  Alder  GSE  to  lose  approximately \n$600,000 in funding for evaluation contracts. Alder GSE’s evaluation partner was providing an \nimportant source of formative feedback and evidence of program effectiveness. The evaluation \nfrom TQP 2020 has a retention study in progress that is six months to completion, but will likely \nnot be completed as a result of the termination of the grant. The evaluation for TQP 2022 still had \n2.5 more years of data collection that has been terminated mid-cycle. \n109.  In addition to the dollars lost, the time and resource demands to meet this sudden \nnews has been extraordinary. There have been countless hours of work to communicate clearly to \nall affected parties and to work with Alder GSE’s Board and team on determining ways to mitigate \nthese significant and completely unexpected losses.  \n110.  These harms prevent Alder GSE from engaging in the core activities compelled by \nits mission and reason for existence.  \nE.  AACTE Member Organization – Teaching Lab \n111.  Teaching Lab is a member organization of Plaintiff AACTE that has been and will \ncontinue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the Department’s grant terminations. In \n2023, Teaching Lab was awarded a three-year TSL grant. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 30 of 39\n \n \n112.  Teaching Lab’s TSL grant funds Project Refine, Innovate, Share, and Elevate \n(“Project RISE”). Project RISE involves the following: (i) implementation of Teaching Lab’s \nteacher leadership and coaching model for public K-12 school systems located in Milwaukee, \nWisconsin, Kemper, Mississippi, El Paso, Texas, and Osceola, Arkansas (the “Public School \nBeneficiaries”); (ii) development of human capital management systems in the foregoing districts; \nand (iii) a rigorous, randomized controlled trial on Teaching Lab’s teacher development and \ncoaching model, to be conducted in partnership with the American Institutes for Research, focused \non the work in Milwaukee.  \n113.  Across all of the Public School Beneficiaries, Teaching Lab’s programs through \nthe TSL grant impact more than 40 schools and more than 150 teachers, whose instruction in turn \nreaches well over 6,000 K-12 students.  \n114.  Teaching Lab’s TSL grant was terminated by the Department, resulting in great \nuncertainty regarding the future of Project Rise. Absent the grant funding, Teaching Lab will no \nlonger be able to provide the curriculum-based professional learning and coaching services \nthrough Project RISE to the Public School Beneficiaries. At this time, Teaching Lab does not have \nan alternate source of funding. The Public School Beneficiaries do not have room in their budget \nto unexpectedly pay for the services. \n115.  Teaching Lab has hired more than two dozen employees and contractors to support \nProject RISE. If the TSL grant funding is suspended for any amount of time, Teaching Lab will \nlikely have to furlough or layoff many or all of these workers.  \n116.  The termination of the grant also puts the American Institutes for Research study \nevaluating how school districts can best spend their limited funds and limited teacher development \ntime and resources at risk. Teaching Lab is not able to fund the study without the TSL grant funds. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 31 of 39\n \n \n117.  In addition to the loss of the study, the Public School Beneficiaries and the public \nwill be significantly harmed by the termination of the grant, as one or more of the Public School \nBeneficiaries is likely to lose the benefit of Teaching Lab’s services. Specifically, the Public \nSchool Beneficiaries stand to lose value of up to roughly $7 million in services if the termination \nmoves forward. \n118.  These harms prevent Project RISE from engaging in the core activities compelled \nby its mission and reason for existence.  \nF.  AACTE Member Organization – University A12  \n119.  University A is a member organization of Plaintiff AACTE that has been and will \ncontinue to be substantially and irreparably harmed by the Department’s grant terminations. In \n2022, University A was awarded a five-year TQP grant. \n120.  University A’s TQP grant funds Program A, a program that supports talented rural \nindividuals to receive an undergraduate degree and license without leaving their hometown. \nCandidates can receive a Bachelor of Arts degree and a teaching license in early childhood \neducation, elementary education, special education, middle school math education, and secondary \nscience education. University A partners with rural community colleges employing many rural \neducators.  \n121.  Program A was created to address the extreme teacher shortage in rural State A. \nPre-K through year 12 students can go years without a qualified teacher, forcing rural districts to \nhire people without degrees or experience and negatively impacting rural students’ learning. \n \n12 University A is an AACTE member organization that is fearful of retaliation, and therefore, did not wish \nto disclose its name in this Complaint or provide a Declaration that identified it by name. However, it \nwanted to share the severe and devastating impact the Department’s termination of its TQP grant has caused \nand will continue to cause, absent Court intervention. This Complaint refers to the member organization as \n“University A” in State A, and its teacher preparation program as “Program A.” \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 32 of 39\n \n \n122.  Program A’s TQP grant has an immensely positive economic impact on rural \ncommunities in State A. Specifically, the program funded by the grant serves 57 rural State A \nschool districts in partnership with four rural community colleges. These districts stretch across \nState A representing some of the most financially impoverished communities in State A, and have \nsome of the highest teacher shortage areas in the state. Program A was able to provide teachers for \nmore than 2,500 students in pre-K through year 12 each year. \n123.  Program A graduated 49 teachers who are presently teaching in State A rural \nschools. Currently, there are 77 students supported through the grant, as well as eight recent \ngraduates supported within required induction supports.  \n124.  The termination of the grant forced University A to terminate the employment of \nthe instructors who teach the courses, and eliminated the infrastructure and human resources that \nsupport Program A. University A anticipated preparing 146 teachers by the end of the five-year \ngrant in 2027 and anticipated supporting these new teachers in their beginning years of teaching. \nThe termination of the grant will result in a loss of 69 new teachers for these hard-hit rural areas. \n125.  Furthermore, there was a total of 11 full-time equivalent positions in both rural \ncommunities and in State A’s major city funded through the grant, however with the grant’s \ntermination, the money supporting rural grant employee salaries was lost immediately; State A’s \ncommunity college partners are uncertain about the ability to utilize emergency institutional funds \nto continue them, even short term. University A is using emergency funding to support State A \ngrant employees until the end of the Spring 2025 semester, however, after the end of the semester, \nall of the rural grant employees will be forced to be let go. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 33 of 39\n \n \n126.  With the grant’s termination, Program A will no longer be able to continue, which \nwill have significant consequences on University A and its community as well as the rural \ncommunities it serves. \n127.  These harms prevent Program A from engaging in the core activities compelled by \nits mission and reason for existence.  \nX.  Defendants’  Actions  Will  Cause  Plaintiffs  and  Their  Member  Organizations \nImmediate and Irreparable Harm.  \n128.  Defendants’ actions have harmed Plaintiffs and their member organizations by \nunlawfully depriving them of funding, which without Court intervention, will continue to cause \nimmediate and irreparable harm. \n129.  The funding was also used towards tuition support for enrollment at many of the \ncolleges and universities. Without this ability of the Grant Recipients to address significant \nfinancial barriers for students, many will no longer be able to afford to continue to pursue a career \nin teaching and the programs’ attendance will plummet.  \n130.  Due to the lack of funding for these programs, the Grant Recipients presently have, \nand will continue to have, a more difficult time recruiting new students. The tuition and other \nfinancial supports provided by the grants was used as a recruitment tool by the Grant Recipients. \nWithout these tools to make it more affordable for cohorts of future teachers to pursue education \ncareers, enrollment will decline, and significant structural changes will have to be made to address \nthat  decline,  including  changes  that  it  may  take  years  to  repair,  such  as  loss  of  staff  and \ninfrastructure that cannot be easily re-scaled. \n131.  The termination of grants will jeopardize the pipeline of high-quality educators \nentering into schools nationwide. The forced closure of the teacher preparation programs as a result \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 34 of 39\n \n \nof the lack of funding results in losing talented candidates who are ready and eager to serve \nstudents, particularly in high-need areas like special education.  \n132.  The loss of funding will not only significantly reduce the Grant Recipients’ ability \nto address the ongoing teacher shortage, but also exacerbate the teacher shortages, especially in \nrural and urban communities, across the country.  \n133.  Without the grant funding, the Grant Recipients will no longer be able to provide \ntargeted resources and training, peer support networks, professional development, and mentorship \nthat are critical to teachers’ success in the classroom. \n134.  The termination of the grants is also resulting in, and will continue to result in, loss \nof employment for the dedicated staff members and grant managers who worked to make the \nteacher preparation programs run. \n135.  The harm suffered by Plaintiffs is actual, not theoretical, as the funding was \nterminated in February 2025, immediately resulting in the Grant Recipients’ inability to continue \ntheir programs, particularly given that the terminations occurred in the middle of the academic \nyear. \n136.  The loss of the funding will frustrate the Grant Recipients’ abilities to fulfil their \nmission of providing programs to offer supports to improve the quality of teaching and school \nleadership. \n137.  The Termination Letters provide that the Grant Recipients may challenge the \ntermination decision by submitting information documenting their position in writing to the \nDepartment within thirty days of the termination. See Exhibit B at pages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 35 of 39\n \n \n138.  However, any appeal to the Department does not alter the fact that the termination \nof funding was effective on the date of notification in February 2025. There is no funding provided \nstarting the date of termination pending any appeals. \n139.  There is no timeframe by which the Department is obliged to make a determination \nregarding an appeal. Therefore, even if the Grant Recipients appeal the termination decision, the \ntimeframe in which a determination would be made is unknown. While any appeals are pending, \nthe Grant Recipients will continue to be deprived of funding.  \n140.  Absent Court intervention, regardless of whether the Grant Recipients submit an \nappeal to the Department, many Grant Recipients will be forced to shut down their programs as a \nresult of Defendants’ unlawful actions, resulting in great harm. \nXI.  Plaintiffs  were  Further  Harmed  by  Defendants’  Unlawfully  Imposed  Grant \nConditions. \n141.  Generally, unless a grantee poses a specific risk, they can draw down funds from \ntheir grant award based on the allowable, allocable and reasonable costs approved in their grant \nbudget without prior approval. \n142.  In addition to the unlawful actions concerning terminating the grants discussed \nabove, the Department also added a special condition to impacted grants after they were terminated \nrequiring prior approval for them to draw down funds. This special condition is referred to as \n“route pay.” \n143.  The  grantees  are  eligible  for  costs  that  were  properly  incurred  before  their \ntermination date and costs that would not have occurred if the grant was not terminated. They have \n120 days to draw down the funds after the termination date. (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.343, 200.472, \n200.344(b)).  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 36 of 39\n \n \n144.  The regulations that govern federal grants set the reasons that the Department can \nput conditions on grants and the requirements for notice prior to doing so. Imposing a special \ncondition, such as establishing additional prior approvals, on a grant can only be done if the grantee \nis determined to pose a risk. Factors that may be considered are financial stability, quality of \nmanagement systems and standards, history of performance, audit reports and filings, ability to \neffectively implement requirements, history of compliance with conditions of a federal award, or \na responsibility determination. (2 C.F.R. § 200.208). \n145.  The rule also states that before conditions are put in place, the agency has to notify \nthe grantee as to: (1) The nature of the additional requirements; (2) The reason why the additional \nrequirements are being imposed; (3) The nature of the action needed to remove the additional \nrequirement, if applicable; (4) The time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and \n(5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. (Id.). \n146.  Without notice or any finding of individual grantee risk, the Department put a \nblanket condition on the terminated grants to require prior approval for all drawdowns. \n147.  This new, unlawfully-imposed condition will cause delays in the Grant Recipients \nreceiving their grant funds and add potential subjectivity to already approved costs. \n148.  Therefore, placing the grants on route pay was unlawful.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  \n(Fifth Amendment Due Process (Vagueness)) \n149.  All preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are incorporated as if fully set forth \nherein. \n150.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a governmental \nenactment, like an executive order, is unconstitutionally vague if it “fails to provide a person of \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 37 of 39\n \n \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 \n(2008). \n151.  The Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 “fails to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited” and “is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” Id. \n152.  Executive Order 14151 does not define key terms, including “DEI,” “DEIA,” \n“equity” or “equity-related” and fails to satisfy the constitutional minimum. \n153.  This Court previously granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the President’s \nadministration from terminating any awards on the basis of the Termination Provision in the \nNADOHE Order.  \n154.  The NADOHE Order applies to not just the named plaintiffs in that action, but to \nall contractors and grantees who were subjected to the Termination Provision. \n155.  Plaintiffs  and  their  member  organizations  were  subjected  to  the  Termination \nProvision when the Department terminated the grants at issue in this lawsuit under the instructions \nprovided in Executive Order 14151. \n156.  It follows, therefore, that Plaintiffs should also be returned to the status quo ante – \ntheir status prior to the Department subjecting them to the unlawful Termination Provision when \nit terminated their grants – just as the NADOHE Order intended. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  \n(Violation of APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Decision) \n157.  All preceding paragraphs of this Complaint are incorporated as if fully set forth \nherein. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 38 of 39\n \n \n158.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law . . . [or \nare made] without observance of procedure required by law[.]” (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). \n159.  Defendants’ termination of the Grant Recipients’ grants constitutes final agency \naction under the APA. The Termination Letters provide that the “Department hereby terminates \ngrant No. [] in its entirety effective 2/[]/25,” marking it the consummation of the Department’s \ndecision-making process and demanding immediate compliance with the announced position. As \nof the date of the Termination Letters, the Department stopped providing all funding approved by \nthe  grants,  thereby  having  a  direct  and  immediate  effect  on  Plaintiffs  and  their  member \norganizations. \n160.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the grants is unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious \nfor the reasons set forth above. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:  \n(A)  Declare Defendants’ termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants unlawful; \n(B)  Declare Defendants’ actions placing TQP, SEED, and TSL grants on route pay \nunlawful; \n(C)  Enter  a  preliminary  injunction  or  temporary  restraining  order  (a) enjoining \nDefendants’ enforcement of the termination of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants; (b) ordering such \ngrant funding reinstated forthwith; (c) ordering Defendants to provide the Grant Recipients \nreimbursement for all otherwise allowable expenditures incurred between the date of termination \nand the Court’s order; (d) enjoining Defendants’ termination of any additional TQP, SEED, and \nTSL grants if such termination would be inconsistent with the Court’s order; and (e) removing the \nroute pay grant conditions from TQP, SEED, and TSL grants;  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 1     Filed 03/03/25     Page 39 of 39\n \n \n(D)  Issue a permanent injunction providing the same relief;  \n(E)  Award Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and  \n(F)  Grant such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \nDated: March 3, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Daniel M.

Civil No.: 1:25-cv-00702-JRR \n \nLINDA MCMAHON, in her official  \ncapacity as Secretary of Education, et al., \n   \nDefendants. \n      \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThis matter comes before the court on Plaintiffs American Association of Colleges for \nTeacher Education, National Center for Teacher Residencies, and the Maryland Association of \nColleges  for  Teacher  Education’s  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order/Preliminary \nInjunction.  (ECF No. 5; the “Motion.”)  Following expedited briefing by the parties, the court \nconvened  a  hearing  on  the  Motion  on  March  13,  2025.    For  the  reasons  that  follow,  by \naccompanying order, Plaintiffs’ Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (“AACTE”), National \nCenter for Teacher Residencies (“NCTR”), and the Maryland Association of Colleges for Teacher \nEducation (“MACTE”) initiated this action on March 5, 2025.  (ECF No. 1; the “Complaint.”)  \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise from the Department of Education’s (the “Department”) termination of \ngrants awarded through its Teacher Quality Partnership Program (“TQP”), Supporting Effective \nEducator Development Program (“SEED”), and the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program \n(“TSL”) (collectively, the “Grant Programs”).  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 2 of 48\nA.  Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs AACTE, NCTR, and MACTE are composed of members that provide teacher \npreparation programs throughout the United States.  (ECF No. 1 at p. 2.)   \nPlaintiff AACTE is the largest membership organization dedicated to educator preparation \nin the United States.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 12.)  Its hundreds of members include public and private \ncolleges and universities, as well as nonprofit organizations.  Id.  AACTE members work with \nteachers, counselors, pre-Kindergarten through grade 12 administrators, and college faculty.  Id.  \nAACTE shares its membership organization’s research, policy insights, and best practices with \nprofessional educators to further its mission of “elevat[ing] education and educator preparation \nthrough research, professional practice, advocacy, and collaboration.”  Id.  Fifty-four AACTE \nmembers, including five located in Maryland, were awarded TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.  (ECF \nNo. 5-3 ¶¶ 5, 6.)   \nNCTR’s members include colleges, universities, and nonprofit teaching organizations \nacross the United States.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 13.)  Its mission is “to transform educator preparation by \nadvancing the teacher residency movement to prepare, support, and retain more effective educators \nwho represent and value the communities they serve.”  Id.   NCTR “supports the design of new \nteacher residency programs and provides consulting to strengthen existing programs across the \nUnited States.”  Id.  NCTR’s members use grant money, including from the Grant Programs, to \n“reduce tuition costs for aspiring teachers called teacher residents, pay host K-12 teachers for the \nwork they are doing to support the aspiring teachers, offset the cost for licensure examinations and \ntest prep workshops, and provide a stipend or pay for work the teacher residents are completing \nthrough their internships.”  Id.  Twenty-five NCTR members received SEED, TQP, and/or TSL \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 3 of 48\ngrant awards; and in 2022, the Department awarded NCTR a three-year SEED grant.  (NCTR \nDecl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 5–6.)    \nMACTE is a membership organization with a mission “to serve as a distinct statewide \nvoice on matters of importance to educator preparation programs at Maryland’s colleges and \nuniversities.” (ECF No. 1 ¶ 14.)  MACTE’s members are “college and universities engaged in the \npreparation of professional school personnel with state program approval.”  Id.  All of MACTE’s \nmembers are located in Maryland.  (ECF No. 5-3 ¶ 6.)  Three of MACTE’s 10 members received \nTQP and SEED grants.  Id. ¶ 7.  These TQP and SEED grant recipients use their grant awards to \nrecruit, retain, and support teachers in Maryland.  Id. ¶ 5.  \nB.  The Grant Programs \nThe Grant Programs’ authorizing statutes reserve funds for the Secretary of the Department \n(the “Secretary”) to award grants on a competitive basis to provide funding for specified purposes.  \nAccording to the statute, TQP grant funds shall be used for “carry[ing] out a program for the \npreparation of teachers . . ., a teaching residency . . ., or a combination of such programs” that \ninclude certain requirements specified in 20 U.S.C. § 1022a(d) and (e).  20 U.S.C. § 1022a(c)(1).   \nSEED provides grants for the purposes of:  \n(1) providing teachers, principals, or other school leaders from \nnontraditional preparation and certification routes or pathways to \nserve in traditionally underserved local educational agencies; \n(2) providing evidence-based professional development activities \nthat address literacy, numeracy, remedial, or other needs of local \neducational agencies and the students the agencies serve; \n(3)  providing  teachers,  principals,  or  other  school  leaders  with \nprofessional  development  activities  that  enhance  or  enable  the \nprovision of postsecondary coursework through dual or concurrent \nenrollment programs and early college high school settings across a \nlocal educational agency; \n(4) making freely available services and learning opportunities to \nlocal educational agencies, through partnerships and cooperative \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 4 of 48\nagreements or by making the services or opportunities publicly \naccessible through electronic means; or \n(5)  providing  teachers,  principals,  or  other  school  leaders  with \nevidence-based  professional  enhancement  activities,  which  may \ninclude activities that lead to an advanced credential. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 6672(a).   \nTSL provides grants to “eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or expand \nperformance-based compensation systems or human capital management systems, in schools \nserved by the eligible entity.”  20 U.S.C.  § 6631(a).  TSL’s authorizing statute describes its \npurposes as follows: \n(1)  to  assist  States,  local  educational  agencies,  and  nonprofit \norganizations  to  develop,  implement,  improve,  or  expand \ncomprehensive performance-based compensation systems or human \ncapital management systems for teachers, principals, or other school \nleaders (especially for teachers, principals, or other school leaders \nin high-need schools) who raise student academic achievement and \nclose  the  achievement  gap  between  high-  and  low-performing \nstudents; and \n(2) to study and review performance-based compensation systems \nor human capital management systems for teachers, principals, or \nother school leaders to evaluate the effectiveness, fairness, quality, \nconsistency, and reliability of the systems. \n \nId. § 6631. \n  Per their authorizing statutes, SEED and TSL awards provide grants for periods of “not \nmore than 3 years.”  20 U.S.C. §§ 6672(b)(1), 6632(b)(1).  TQP awards provide grants for periods \nup to five years.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 4.) \nC.  The Application Process  \n \nThe Grant Programs’ authorizing statutes set forth grant application procedures.  20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1022a(b), 6672(d), 6632(c).  The statutory application process for the Grant Programs (set forth \nin Title 20 of the United States Code, titled “Education”) is implemented in accordance with the \nCode of Federal Regulations, Title 34, which governs the Department specifically.  According to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 5 of 48\nthe regulations adopted to implement the statutory application process for the Grant Programs, the \nSecretary is required to publish proposed and final “Annual absolute, competitive preference, and \ninvitational priorities” in the Federal Register.  34 C.F.R. § 75.105.  The applicable regulations \nalso require that the Secretary’s proposed priorities go through public comment rule making except \nin the following circumstances: \n(i) The final annual priorities will be implemented only by inviting \napplications that meet the priorities; \n(ii) The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of priorities \nalready established in the program’s regulations; \n(iii) Publishing proposed annual priorities would seriously interfere \nwith an orderly, responsible grant award process or would otherwise \nbe impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest; \n(iv) The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to \nestablish specified priorities; or \n(v)  The  annual  priorities  are  chosen  from  allowable  activities \nspecified in the program statute. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2).  Once the priorities are established through notice and comment, they \nmust then be published in a notice in the  Federal Register, usually in the Notice  Inviting \nApplications seeking grant applicants.  Id. § 75.105(a).  \n  The Department is subject to additional rule making requirements under the General \nEducation Provisions Act (“GEPA”) at 20 U.S.C. § 1232.  Important here, GEPA carves out \nDepartment priority notice and comment rule making, including as applied to the Grant Programs \nstatutory application process, from the Administrative Procedure Act’s (“APA”) more generalized \nexemption of grant-related matters from public notice and comment rule making requirements.  5 \nU.S.C. § 553(a)(2).  Under GEPA,  \nThe exemption for . . . grants and benefits in section 553(a)(2) of \nTitle 5 [of the APA] shall apply only to regulations-- \n(1)  that  govern  the  first  grant  competition  under  a  new  or \nsubstantially  revised  program  authority  as  determined  by  the \nSecretary; or \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 6 of 48\n(2) where the Secretary determines that the requirements of this \nsubsection will cause extreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries \nof the program affected by such regulations. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1232(d).   \nFor purposes of § 1232(d), a “regulation” is “any generally applicable rule, regulation, \nguideline, interpretation, or other requirement that (1) is prescribed by the Secretary or the \nDepartment; and (2) has legally binding effect in connection with, or affecting, the provision of \nfinancial assistance under any applicable program.”  20 U.S.C. § 1232(a).  “Applicable program” \nmeans “any program for which the Secretary or the Department has administrative responsibility \nas provided by law or by delegation of authority pursuant to law.”  Id. § 1221(c)(1).  \n  Here, Plaintiffs’ members that received (now terminated) TQP, TSL, and SEED grants \n(“Grant Recipients”)1 were selected to receive funding (“Grant Awards”) from FY 2020, 2022, \nand 2024 TQP Grants; FY 2022 SEED Grants; and FY 2023 TSL Grants.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 32–34, \n38, 42.)  All Grant Recipients applied for Grant Program awards pursuant to a Notice Inviting \nApplication published in the Federal Register.  For TQP Grant Program awards, Notices Inviting \nApplications appeared at 85 Fed. Reg. 29691–29704; 87 Fed. Reg. 10906–10923; and 89 Fed. \nReg. 23573–23592.

Change of Administration  \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump was sworn in, for the second time, as President of \nthe United States.  That same day, he signed Executive Order 14151 titled “Ending Radical and \nWasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.”  Exec. Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical \nand Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025).  \nThe “Purpose and Policy” portion of Executive Order 14151 provides:  \nThe Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination \nprograms, going by the name  ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ \n(DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas \nranging from airline safety to the military.  This was a concerted \neffort stemming from President Biden’s first day in office, when he \nissued  Executive  Order  13985,  “Advancing  Racial  Equity  and \nSupport  for  Underserved  Communities  Through  the  Federal \nGovernment.”   \n \nPursuant to Executive Order 13985 and follow-on orders, nearly \nevery Federal agency and entity submitted “Equity Action Plans” to \ndetail the ways that they have furthered DEIs infiltration of the \nFederal Government. The public release of these plans demonstrated \nimmense public waste and shameful discrimination.  That ends \ntoday.  Americans deserve a government committed to serving every \nperson with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious \ntaxpayer resources only on making America great. \n \nId. § 1, Purpose and Policy. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 8 of 48\nOf import here, Executive Order 14151 mandates the termination of, inter alia, certain \ngrants and programs as follows:  \n(b) Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation \nwith the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director \nof OPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty \ndays of this order: \n \n(i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all \nDEI,  DEIA,  and  “environmental  justice”  offices  and \npositions  (including  but  not  limited  to  “Chief  Diversity \nOfficer”  positions);  all  “equity  action  plans,”  “equity” \nactions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” grants or \ncontracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements \nfor employees, contractors, or grantees. \n \nId. § 2(b)(1), Implementation.2   \n  On February 3, 2025, three membership associations (none a plaintiff here) and the City of \nBaltimore  filed  action  in  this  court  against  President  Trump,  the  Acting  Secretary  of  the \nDepartment, and the Acting Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, \nCommerce, Agriculture, and Energy, and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior.

Md. Feb. 21, 2025), opinion clarified, No. 25-\nCV-0333-ABA, 2025 WL 750690, *5 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2025) \n  Following Executive Order 14151, but before the NADOHE preliminary injunction, the \nDepartment’s Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development issued an internal directive \n(the “Directive”) titled “Eliminating Discrimination and Fraud in Department Grant Awards.”3  \n(ECF No. 24-2.)  The Directive, dated February 5, 2025, was signed by Acting Secretary of the \nDepartment Denise L. Carter.  Id.  The Directive begins:  \nFrom the Supreme Court’s 1954 landmark opinion in Brown v. \nBoard  of  Education  to  its  2023  decision  in  Students  for  Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. Fellows of Harvard College, education has \nplayed a central role in this Nation’s fight against discrimination. It \nremains a priority of the Department of Education to eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. This includes ensuring that the Department’s grants do not \nsupport programs or organizations that promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives or any other \ninitiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic. \nIllegal DEI policies and practices can violate both the letter and \npurpose  of  Federal  civil  rights  law  and  conflict  with  the \nDepartment’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence \nin education. In addition to complying with the civil rights laws, it \nis vital that the Department assess whether all grant payments are \nfree from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to assess whether \ncurrent grants are in the best interests of the United States. \n \nId.  \nThrough the Directive, the Department instructed its personnel as follows:   \nFor these reasons, pursuant to, among other authorities, 20 U.S.C. § \n3411 and 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–341, the Secretary of Education \nhereby directs as follows: \n \n \n3 The Directive was offered by Defendants as an exhibit to their opposition to the Motion and was referenced by \ndefense counsel at the hearing over no objection.  At the hearing, defense counsel explained, over no objection by \nopposing counsel, that the Directive was made public by way of a social media post that was not at the direction, or \nwith the permission, of Acting Secretary Carter. In other words, it was leaked.  Plaintiffs offer no challenge to its \nauthenticity.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 8; ECF No. 24-2.)   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 10 of 48\nDepartment personnel shall conduct an internal review of all new \ngrant awards, grants that have not yet been awarded to specific \nindividuals or entities (e.g., notices of funding opportunities), and \nissued  grants.  Such  review  shall  be  limited  to  ensuring  that \nDepartment grants do not fund discriminatory practices—including \nin  the  form  of  DEI—that  are  either  contrary  to  law  or  to  the \nDepartment’s policy objectives, as well as to ensure that all grants \nare free from fraud, abuse, and duplication. \n \nId.  See also Oglesby Decl., Hearing Ex. No. 2 ¶ 5.  The Directive makes no mention of President \nTrump, Executive Order 14151, or any other Executive Order.   \nE.  February 2025 Termination  \nIn early February 2025, the majority of Grant Recipients received a letter from the \nDepartment, which reads:  \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation  is  terminating  your  federal  award,  [Grant  Award \nnumber]. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340–43; see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.523. \n \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment's grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education. In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess whether current grants are in the best interests of the United \nStates. \n \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 11 of 48\nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States. The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer \neffectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see \nalso  34  C.F.R.  §  75.253.  Therefore,  pursuant  to,  among  other \nauthorities, 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the \ntermination provisions in your grant award, the Department hereby \nterminates grant No. [___] in its entirety effective [February ___, \n2025]. \n \n(ECF No. 1-2; the “Termination Letter.”) \n \nIn addition to the Termination Letter, Grant Recipients received updated Grant Award \nNotifications (“GANs”).  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 5.)  The GANs contained information regarding the Grant \nRecipient, Grant Project award information, project staff and title, key personnel, award periods, \nauthorized periods, authorized funding, administrative information, legislative and fiscal data, and \nterms and conditions.  (ECF No. 1-1.)  The updated GANs read: “[t]his grant is deemed to be \ninconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a)(4); \nsee also 34 C.F.R. 75.253.”  Id.  \n Since the Termination Letters were issued, Plaintiffs and their member organizations have \nstopped receiving their Grant Award funds.  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 11.)  As a result, Plaintiffs’ member \norganizations are unable to continue their work, which directly effects thousands of students and \neducators, and threatens the existence of Grant Recipients’ programs.  Id.; see, e.g. ECF No. 5-6 \nDeclaration of Carolyn Parker, Ph.D., of AACTE member American University (“AU”) (attesting \nto deleterious impact of TQP grant termination); ECF No. 5-7, Declaration of Amy Smith, Ph.D., \nof AACTE member University of St. Thomas (“UST”) (same); ECF No. 5-8, Declaration of \nHeather Kirkpatrick, Ph.D., of NCTR and AACTE member Alder Graduate School of Education \n(same); ECF No. 5-9, Declaration of Dr. Sarah Johnson, of AACTE member Teaching Lab (same \nre TSL grant termination); ECF No. 5-4, Declaration of Kathlene Campbell, Ph.

In full, the February  \n2025 Press Release reads:  \nThe  U.S.  Department  of  Education  today  announced  it  has \nterminated over $600 million in grants to institutions and nonprofits \nthat were using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education \nagencies  on  divisive  ideologies.  Training  materials  included \ninappropriate and unnecessary topics such as Critical Race Theory; \nDiversity,  Equity,  and  Inclusion  (DEI);  social  justice  activism; \n“anti-racism”;  and  instruction  on  white  privilege  and  white \nsupremacy. Additionally, many of these grants included teacher and \nstaff recruiting strategies implicitly and explicitly based on race. \n \nThe grants are awarded to teacher preparation programs that train \nfuture classroom teachers. Examples from the grant applications \nincluded: \n•  Requiring  practitioners  to  take  personal  and  institutional \nresponsibility for systemic inequities (e.g., racism) and critically \nreassess their own practices;  \n•  Receiving  professional  development  workshops  and  equity \ntraining on topics such as “Building Cultural Competence,” \n“Dismantling  Racial  Bias”  and  “Centering  Equity  in  the \nClassroom”; \n•  Acknowledging and responding to systemic forms of oppression \nand  inequity,  including  racism,  ableism,  “gender-based” \ndiscrimination, homophobia, and ageism; \n•  Providing  “targeted  practices  in  culturally  relevant  and \nresponsive  teaching  abolitionist  pedagogies  and  issues  of \ndiversity in classroom management”; and \n•  Providing  spaces  for  critical  reflection  to  help  educators \nconfront biases and have transformative conversations about \nequity. \n \n4 The February 2025 Press Release is available on the Department’s website at https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-\nrelease/us-department-of-education-cuts-over-600-million-divisive-teacher-training-grants  (last  visited  Mar.  17, \n2025).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 13 of 48\n \nId.   \nF.  Resulting Litigation  \nFollowing issuance of the Termination Letters, at least two lawsuits were filed to challenge \nthe Department’s termination of the Grant Awards.  On March 3, 2025, Plaintiffs filed the instant \naction asserting that the Department’s termination of their members’ TQP, SEED, and TSL Grant \nAwards violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Count I) and the APA (Count \nII).5  (ECF No. 1.)  That same day, Plaintiffs filed the Motion for temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction to reinstate the terminated Grant Awards and to enjoin Defendants from \nterminating other Grant Awards under the same rationale.  (ECF No. 5.)  On March 5, 2025, the \ncourt convened a status conference with the parties.  The parties agreed to treat the Motion as one \nfor preliminary injunction only (in lieu of first addressing the motion for temporary restraining \norder) and, with the parties’ consent, the court set an expedited briefing schedule and scheduled a \nhearing.  (ECF No. 18.)  On March 13, 2025, the parties appeared for a hearing on the Motion. \nAfter the instant case was filed, but before the hearing on the Motion, the states of \nCalifornia,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  Colorado,  Illinois,  New  York,  Wisconsin,  and  the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts joined as plaintiffs to file suit in the United States District Court \nfor the District of Massachusetts (Civil Case No. 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ; the “California case”).  The \nCalifornia plaintiffs allege the Department, Secretary McMahon, and former Acting Secretary \nCarter violated the APA by terminating TQP and SEED Grant Awards.  On March 10, 2025, the \npresiding judge, the Honorable Myong J. Joun, entered a temporary restraining order as follows: \n1. Defendants shall immediately restore Plaintiff States to the pre-\nexisting status quo prior to the termination under all previously \nawarded TQP or SEED grants for recipients in Plaintiff States;  \n \n5 Plaintiff NCTR seeks redress of termination of its own grant, as well as of those of its members.

Defendants are temporarily enjoined from implementing, giving \neffect to, maintaining, or reinstating under a different name the \ntermination of any previously awarded TQP or SEED grants for \nrecipients in Plaintiff States, including but not limited to through the \nTermination  Letter,  Termination  GAN,  and  any  other  agency \nactions  implementing  such  terminations,  such  as  suspension  or \nwithholding of any funds approved and obligated for the grants;  \n \n3.  Defendants  are  temporarily  enjoined  from  terminating  any \nindividual TQP and SEED grant for recipients in Plaintiff States, \nexcept to the extent the final agency action is consistent with the \nCongressional  authorization  and  appropriations,  relevant  federal \nstatute, including the requirements of the APA, the requirements of \nthe  relevant  implementing  regulations,  the  grant  terms  and \nconditions, and this Court’s Order;  \n \n4. Within 24 hours of entry of this Order, Defendants shall provide \nnotice of the TRO to their employees and anyone acting in concert \nwith them, and to all TQP and SEED grantees in Plaintiff States;  \n \n5. Defendants shall file a status report with the Court, within 24 \nhours of entry of this Order, confirming their compliance with the \nCourt’s TRO;  \n \n6. This TRO shall become effective immediately upon entry by this \nCourt. The TRO shall remain in effect for 14 days; and  \n \n7. By March 11, 2025 at 5 P.M., the parties shall jointly propose a \nbriefing schedule regarding Plaintiff States’ request for preliminary \ninjunction. \n \nCalifornia v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., — F. Supp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825, \nat *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  The California defendants filed a notice of appeal of the temporary \nrestraining order the following day.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.  “A \npreliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy’ that ‘may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.’”  Pierce v. N. Carolina State Bd. of Elections, \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 15 of 48\n97 F.4th 194, 209 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 \n(2008)); see Benisek v. Lamone, 585 U.S. 155, 158 (2018) (noting that “a preliminary injunction \nis ‘an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right’”).  As such, preliminary injunctive relief is \nto be “granted only sparingly and in limited circumstances.”   St. Michael’s Media, Inc. v. Mayor \n& City Council of Baltimore, 566 F. Supp. 3d 327, 351 (D. Md. 2021), aff’d, No. 21-2158, 2021 \nWL 6502219 (4th Cir. Nov. 3, 2021), and aff’d, No. 21-2206, 2021 WL 6502220 (4th Cir. Nov. \n13, 2021) (quoting Micro Strategy, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 245 F.3d 335, 339 (4th Cir. 2001)).   \nA plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief “must establish that 1) they are likely to \nsucceed on the merits; 2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief; 3) the \nbalance of the equities favors the requested injunctive relief; and 4) that relief is in the public \ninterest.”  Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle v. Baltimore Police Dep’t, 2 F.4th 330, 339 (4th Cir. \n2021) (citing In re Search Warrant Issued June 13, 2019, 942 F.3d 159, 170–71 (4th Cir. 2019)). \nThese factors were established by the Supreme Court in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008).   “[P]laintiff bears the burden of establishing that each of these \nfactors supports granting the injunction.”6  Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 \nF.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991) (citing cases); see St. Michael’s Media, Inc., 566 F. Supp. 3d at 351 \n(same). \n \n \n    \n \n6 “Because preliminary injunction proceedings are informal ones designed to prevent irreparable harm before a later \ntrial governed by the full rigor of usual evidentiary standards, district courts may look to, and indeed in appropriate \ncircumstances rely on, hearsay or other inadmissible evidence when deciding whether a preliminary injunction is \nwarranted.”  St. Michael’s Media, Inc. v.

Standing  \nThe  Constitution  extends  the  judicial  power  of  Article  III  courts  to  “cases”  or \n“controversies.”  U.S. CONST. ART. III, § 2, cl. 1.  The doctrine of standing, among others, \n“implements” this limit.  Carney v. Adams, 592 U.S. 53, 58 (2020).  Accordingly, as a threshold \nmatter, the court must determine whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action.  To establish \nstanding: \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact that is both \nconcrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural \nor hypothetical. Second, the plaintiff's injury must be fairly traceable \nto the challenged action of the defendant, meaning that there must \nbe  a  causal  connection  between  the  injury  and  the  conduct \ncomplained  of.  Third,  it  must  be  likely,  as  opposed  to  merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. \n \nDep’t. of Educ v. Brown, 600 U.S. 551, 561 (2023) (citations omitted) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)). \n  In TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, the Supreme Court explained that when determining if a \nplaintiff meets the concrete-harm requirement, “courts should assess whether the alleged injury to \nthe plaintiff has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm ‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis for \na lawsuit in American courts.”  594 U.S. 413, 424 (2021) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. \n330, 341 (2016)).  Traditional tangible harms include physical and monetary harms or losses.  Id. \nat 425. \n  Membership organizations, like Plaintiffs, may establish standing based on their own \ninjury or based on their members’ injuries; the latter standing basis is known as representational \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 17 of 48\nor associational standing.  Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard \nColl., 600 U.S. 181, 199 (2023).  \n As  referenced  in  Section  I.E.,  above,  Plaintiffs  allege  the  following  facts  in  their \nComplaint and through affidavits (or declarations) of relevant persons with knowledge: \nIn 2022, Plaintiff NCTR received a three-year SEED grant.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 65–76; NCTR \nDecl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 6.)  On February 10, 2025, NCTR received a Termination Letter from the \nDepartment informing it that its SEED grant was terminated for no longer effectuating Department \npriorities.  (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 6–7; NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 10, 11.)  That same day, the \nDepartment stopped funding NCTR’s grant. (NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 14, pp. 14–15.)  Without \nthe SEED grant funding, NCTR will be unable to engage in its core activities, including operating \nteacher residency programs and conducting research regarding best practices for teacher training.  \n(ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 65–71; NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶¶ 12, 17–19.)  Accordingly, as a direct result of \nthe  Department’s  termination  decision,  NCTR  suffered  monetary  harm,  and  a  decision  in \nPlaintiffs’ favor, finding the Department’s termination illegal and reinstating NCTR’s SEED grant \nwould remedy NCTR’s alleged harm.  Plaintiff NCTR has sufficiently demonstrated standing to \nbring this action.   \nPlaintiffs AACTE and MACTE assert representational standing through their members.  \n(ECF No. 1 ¶ 4.)7   AACTE and MACTE’s members “together comprise hundreds of teacher \npreparation programs throughout the United States.”  Id. at p. 2.  Their members received TQP, \nSEED, and TSL grants from the Department that remained active until the February 2025 \nTermination Letters.  Id. at pp. 6–7.  To establish representational standing, “an organization must \ndemonstrate that ‘(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \n \n7 Plaintiff NCTR also seeks relief for its members, including without limitation NCTR member and (now terminated) \nTQP Grant Recipient Alder Graduate School of Education.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 14; ECF No. 5-8.) \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 18 of 48\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.’” \nStudents for Fair Admissions, 600 U.S. at 181. (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. \nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  An organization need only “make specific allegations \nestablishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.”  S. Walk at \nBroadlands Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 184 (4th \nCir. 2013) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 (2009)). \nAACTE member organizations received TQP, SEED, and TSL grants.  (ECF No. 1 at p. 2; \nsee supra re Declarations at ECF Nos. 5-6, 5-7, 5-8, and 5-9).  AACTE’s members’ grants \nremained active through early to mid-February 2025 until receipt of the Termination Letter.  Id. at \npp. 3–4.  Among those grants terminated was AU’s TQP grant.  Id. ¶ 77; see also Section I.E., \nsupra.  As a result of the termination and corresponding loss of funding, AU is no longer able to \nrecruit participants to its teacher-training residency program and, if the funding is not reinstated, \nAU will shut down the program.  Id. ¶¶ 83–86.  Accordingly, at least one AACTE member has \nstanding to bring this action in its own right.   \nAACTE’s mission is “to elevate education and educator preparation through research, \nprofessional practice, advocacy, and collaboration.”  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 12.)  The Department’s \ntermination  of  the  Grant  Awards  “directly  threatens  this  mission,”  as  “[t]hese  grants  fund \ninitiatives  that  benefit  PK-12  students  and  schools  nationwide  by  supporting  innovative \napproaches to educator preparation and professional development.”  Id.  AACTE, therefore, \nsatisfies the second prong of representational standing.  Finally, the claims presented and relief \nrequested here concern the legality of the Department’s termination decision and do not require \nthis  court  to  consider  “the  individual  circumstances  of  any  aggrieved”  Plaintiff  member \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 19 of 48\norganization.  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. V. Brock, \n477 U.S. 274, 287 (1986).     \nAccording to the Complaint, Plaintiff MACTE’s member organizations also received \nGrant Program awards and Termination Letters.  (ECF No. 1 at pp. 2–4.)  Further, according to \nthe record before the court, the Department terminated grants awarded to MACTE members \nTowson University, University of Maryland, and Frostburg State University, causing “a substantial \nloss of funds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland.”  (ECF No. 25-1 ¶¶ 5–9.)  Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs fail adequately to allege MACTE’s standing in the Complaint and may not \nsalvage such defect through supplemental declarations or its reply in support of the Motion.  The \ncourt is satisfied that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege MACTE’s standing in the Complaint, and \nreiterate MACTE’s standing in the Motion.   \nSpecifically, the Complaint (ECF No. 1) at page 2 avers that MACTE members received \nGrant Awards; at pages 3 and 4, the Complaint alleges that these grants remained active through \nmid-February 2025 until they were terminated by the Department through the Termination Letters; \nthe Complaint at paragraph 4 defines “Grant Recipients” to include MACTE members; and the \nComplaint at paragraph 14 alleges that the Department’s grant terminations impact MACTE’s core \nmission, and that TQP and SEED Grant Awards support teachers in Maryland.  These allegations \nare supported by MACTE President Dr. Laurie Mullen’s attestation that three of MACTE’s 10 \nmembers received TQP and SEED grants; the Department terminated the grants; and the grant \nterminations caused a substantial loss of funds for teacher preparation programs in Maryland. \n(MACTE Decl., ECF No. 5-5 ¶¶ 6–7.)  Further, Plaintiffs allege that the Department’s Grant \nProgram terminations “implicated MACTE’s core mission,” as MACTE “serves the institutions of \nhigher education in Maryland for both the recruitment and retention of future teachers as well as \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 20 of 48\nthe support and advancement of current classroom teachers.”  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 14.)  Finally, for the \nsame reasons identified in relation to AACTE, the court discerns no cause for it to consider the \nindividual  circumstances  of  MACTE’s  members.    Accordingly,  MACTE  satisfies  all  the \nrequirements of organizational standing.   \nAs a separate but related issue, Defendants also argue Plaintiff MACTE lacks standing \nbecause Judge Joun’s temporary restraining order in the California case (issued March 10, 2025, \nseven days after the instant action was filed) ordered the Department to restore terminated TQP \nand  SEED  grants  to  recipients  in  Maryland,  which  effectively  covers  MACTE’s  allegedly \naggrieved members.  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-10548, — F. Supp. 3d. — , \n2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  This is wrong-headed.  Standing “is concerned \nwith the presence of injury, causation, and redressability at the time a complaint is filed,” whereas \nmootness “scrutinizes the presence of these elements after filing—i.e., at the time of a court’s \ndecision.”  Garcia v. U.S. Citizenship & Immgr. Servs., 168 F. Supp. 3d 50, 65 (D.D.C. 2016).  As \nmentioned, the Complaint here was filed March 3, 2025, a week before the California case TRO.  \n(ECF No. 1.)  Judge Joun’s order does not impair MACTE’s standing here.   \nMoreover, the California TRO does not render MACTE’s (or any Plaintiff’s) claims moot.  \n“A case becomes moot—and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for purposes of Article \nIII—'when issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in \nthe outcome.’”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 \nU.S. 478, 481 (1982)).  A “case is moot if the dispute ‘is no longer embedded in any actual \ncontroversy about the plaintiffs’ particular legal rights.’”  Id. (quoting Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. \n87, 93 (2009)).  This is not the situation at hand.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 21 of 48\nTemporary restraining orders exist to prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or \ndamage by preserving the status quo until the court considers whether to order preliminary \ninjunctive relief (or terminate the TRO).  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(b)(1)(A).  As its name suggests, a \ntemporary restraining order is temporary; unless extended, the order expires within 14 days of \nentry.  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(b)(2).   Rule 65 contemplates the importance of proceeding expeditiously \nfrom entry of a TRO to a preliminary injunction hearing.  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(b)(3).  Indeed, courts \nare instructed to prioritize a preliminary injunction hearing following a TRO granted without \nnotice above all other matters.  Id.  A preliminary injunction provides more lasting relief than a \nTRO; it serves to prevent irreparable harm during the pendency of litigation, and to preserve the \ncourt’s ability to render meaningful judgment and relief on the merits.  In re Microsoft Corp. \nAntitrust Litig., 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003).  While Plaintiffs here, and those in the \nCalifornia case, pursued emergency relief, Judge Joun’s TRO does not, indeed cannot, resolve the \nparties’  disputes.    Against  this  backdrop,  the  question  of  the  legality  of  the  Department’s \ntermination of MACTE members’ TQP and SEED grants remains very much alive and appropriate \nfor this court to consider pursuant to Article III. \n2.  Judicial Review  \nThe APA waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity to permit judicial review \nof agency action in limited circumstances.  5 U.S.C. § 705.  Such review is available in suits \nbrought by “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action” who seeks “relief other than money damages.”  Id.  Importantly, \njudicial review is limited to “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.”  Id. § 704.  “Because ‘sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature,’ finality under the \nAPA is a jurisdictional requirement.”  Jake’s Fireworks Inc. v. United States Consumer Prod. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 22 of 48\nSafety Comm’n, 105 F.4th 627, 631 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting City of New York v. U.S. Dep’t of \nDef., 913 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir. 2019)). \nAgency action is “final” when two conditions are met: (1) “the action must mark the \n‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision making process—it must not be of a merely tentative or \ninterlocutory nature,” and (2) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been \ndetermined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–\n78 (1997) (quoting Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948), \nand Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass’n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatl., 400 U.S. 62, 71 \n(1970)); see Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 808 (2022) (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178). \n  The parties agree, as does the court, that the Department’s termination of the subject TQP, \nSEED,  and  TSL  Grant  Awards  constituted  final  agency  action.    Each  Termination  Letter \nrepresented that the Department had concluded its review of the grant in question.  (ECF No. 1-2).  \nThe Department’s Termination Letters immediately produced legal consequences for the Grant \nRecipients; the Grant Recipients could no longer access the funds allotted to them by the Grant \nAwards.  See Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-239 (LLA), — F. \nSupp. 3d — , 2025 WL 368852, at *10 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (finding Office of Management and \nBudget memorandum directing federal agencies to temporarily pause disbursement of federal \nfinancial assistance and to freeze all such funds “immediately produced legal consequences across \nthe entire federal funding system”).      \nB.  Venue \nWhere, as here, a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States, a plaintiff may \nbring its claims in any judicial district in which: \n(A) a defendant in the action resides,  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 23 of 48\n(B) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the \nsubject of the action is situated, or  \n(C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.  \n \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \n  Although they need only establish one of the above recited circumstances, Plaintiffs aver \nvenue is proper in this district because “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claims occurred in the District of Maryland, and Plaintiff MACTE resides in this district.”  \n(ECF No. 1 ¶ 11.)  Further, under § 1391(e)(1)(C), venue in the District of Maryland is proper \nbecause no real property is involved, Plaintiff MACTE resides in this district, and Defendant \nMcMahon, as the Department Secretary, is an officer of the United States. \n Even if Defendant MACTE lacked standing or was not a party to this action, per § \n1391(e)(1)(B), Plaintiffs ably demonstrate that “a substantial part of the events . . . giving rise to \nthe claim occurred” in Maryland.  “[I]t is possible for venue to be proper in more than one judicial \ndistrict;” the question for the court under § 1391(e)(1)(B) is not whether a given district is the best \nvenue, but whether the events or omissions that occurred there are “sufficiently substantial.”  \nMitrano v. Hawes, 377 F.3d 402, 405 (4th Cir. 2004).  In considering “whether events or omissions \nare sufficiently substantial to support venue . . . , a court should not focus only on those matters \nthat are in dispute or that directly led to the filing of the action.” Id. at 406 (citation omitted).  \nInstead, the court “should review ‘the entire sequence of events underlying the claim.’” Id.; accord \nBrito v. Major Energy Elec. Servs., LLC, 526 F. Supp. 3d 95, 109 (D. Md. 2021) (same); Taylor \nv. Shreeji Swami, PWG-16-3787, 2017 WL 1832206, at *1 (D. Md. May 8, 2017) (same); \nConvergence Mgmt. Assocs., Inc. v. Callender, TDC-15-4015, 2016 WL 6662253, at *2 (D. Md. \nNov. 10, 2016) (same).  A substantial part of the events “does not mean ‘a majority of the events.’”  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 24 of 48\nCoastal Lab’s, Inc. v. Jolly, 502 F. Supp. 3d 1003, 1023 (D. Md. 2020) (quoting Seidel v. Kirby, \n296 F. Supp. 3d 745, 751–52 (D. Md. 2017)).  \nHere, the facts alleged make clear there is more than one relevant “event that occurred in \nMaryland;”  further,  the  Maryland  events  do  not  “appear[]  to  be  unsubstantial.”    Tusha  v. \nGreenfield, No. CV GLR-20-2143, 2021 WL 1530211, at *5 (D. Md. Apr. 19, 2021).  Many \nAACTE members applied for, received, and utilized grants in Maryland.  (ECF No. 5-3 ¶ 6.)  The \nterminations, it is competently alleged, will produce a substantial loss of funds and related \nprogramming for teacher preparation programs in Maryland.  Id. \nC.  Request for Preliminary Injunction  \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must make a clear showing that he is likely \nto succeed at trial and to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.”  Pierce v. N. \nCarolina State Bd. of Elections, 97 F.4th 194, 210 (4th Cir. 2024) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 22 (2008)).  Plaintiffs contend they are likely to succeed on the merits \nof both their Fifth Amendment and APA claims.  The court addresses each in turn.   \na.  Fifth Amendment Due Process Claim – Vagueness \nAmong its many protections, the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall “be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. AMEND. V.  The \nrequirement of clarity is “essential to the protections provided by the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012).  “It is a basic \nprinciple of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 25 of 48\ndefined.”8  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).  Where a law is impermissibly \nvague, it must be invalidated.  Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253.   \n“In our constitutional order, a vague law is no law at all.”  United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. \n445, 447 (2019).  As the Supreme Court has explained:  \nOur doctrine prohibiting the enforcement of vague laws rests on the \ntwin constitutional pillars of due process and separation of powers. \n. . . Vague laws contravene the “first essential of due process of law” \nthat statutes must give people “of common intelligence” fair notice \nof what the law demands of them. . . . Vague laws also undermine \nthe Constitution’s separation of powers and the democratic self-\ngovernance it aims to protect. \n \nId. at 451 (first citing Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 183 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in judgment); then quoting Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, \n391 (1926); then citing Collins v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 634, 638 (1914)).  The void-for-vagueness \ndoctrine thus addresses these “two connected but discrete due process concerns”—that “regulated \nparties should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly,” and that “precision \nand  guidance  are  necessary  so  that  those  enforcing  the  law  do  not  act  in  an  arbitrary  or \ndiscriminatory way.”  Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253; see Just Puppies, Inc. v. Frosh, 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 665, 734 (D. Md. 2021), aff’d sub nom. 123 F.4th 652 (4th Cir. 2024) (same).   \n“Fair notice of the law’s demands . . . is ‘the first essential of due process.’”  Dimaya, 584 \nU.S. at 183 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting Connally, 269 \nU.S. at 391).  It is a “fundamental principle in our legal system . . . that laws which regulate persons \nor entities must give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.”  Fox Television, 567 U.S. \n \n8 As Plaintiffs assert, and this court has previously explained, while challenges to vagueness are often analyzed in the \nstatutory context, the same principles guide consideration of executive orders.  See, e.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity \nOfficers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, — F. Supp. 3d — , No. 1:25-CV-00333-ABA, 2025 WL 573764, at *19 (D. Md. \nFeb. 21, 2025) (discussing principles of statutory vagueness in analyzing a vagueness challenge to an executive order); \nHumanitarian Law Project v. U.S. Treasury Dep’t, 578 F.3d 1133, 1146–47 (9th Cir. 2009) (same); Cnty. of Santa \nClara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 536 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (same).  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 26 of 48\nat 253; see Edgar v. Haines, 2 F.4th 298, 316 (4th Cir. 2021) (same).  “[I]f arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who \napply them.”  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.  “A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy \nmatters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the \nattendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.”  Id. at 108–109.  \nWhile “perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required,” see United States \nv. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008) (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794 \n(1989)), “a statute must give a person of ordinary intelligence adequate notice of what conduct is \nprohibited  and  must  include  sufficient  standards  to  prevent  arbitrary  and  discriminatory \nenforcement.”  Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, 930 F.3d 264, 272–73 (4th Cir. 2019); \nsee Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253 (same).   \nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim rests on allegations that the Termination Provision of  \nExecutive Order 14151 is unconstitutionally vague.9  In order to show they are likely to succeed \non their Fifth Amendment claim, Plaintiffs concede that they must produce evidence that the \nDepartment terminated their members’ Grant Awards pursuant to the Termination Provision of \nExecutive Order 14151.  As will be explained below, Plaintiffs fail to adduce, at this stage, \nsufficient evidence in support of same; as such, they have not met their burden to show a clear \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their Fifth Amendment claim.  The court, therefore, does not \nreach the question of unconstitutional vagueness.  \n \n9 Plaintiffs ask the court to extend to them the benefit of the NADOHE preliminary injunction through retroactive \napplication.  (ECF No. 5-1 at pp. 17–18; see ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 45-52.)  Their arguments are unavailing for the reasons set \nforth in this opinion and because they fail to overcome the material procedural and substantive differences between \nthe case at bar and NADOHE.  Further, on March 14, 2025, the Fourth Circuit granted the NADOHE defendants’ \nrequest to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 27 of 48\nPlaintiffs  allege:  “Plaintiffs  and  their  member  organizations  were  subjected  to  the \nTermination Provision when the Department terminated the grants at issue in this lawsuit under \nthe instructions provided in Executive Order 14151.”  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 155.)  Plaintiffs acknowledge \nthat the Termination Letters did not expressly reference or mention Executive Order 14151, and \nargue that “the Department’s publicly-articulated reason for termination,” as described in the \nFebruary  17,  2025  Press  Release,  offers  competent  circumstantial  evidence  to  support  the \nconclusion that the Department terminated the Grant Awards in obeyance of Executive Order \n14151.  (ECF No. 5-1 at pp. 15, 17–18 .)     \nAs discussed supra, the full February 2025 Press Release reads:  \nThe  U.S.  Department  of  Education  today  announced  it  has \nterminated over $600 million in grants to institutions and nonprofits \nthat were using taxpayer funds to train teachers and education \nagencies  on  divisive  ideologies.  Training  materials  included \ninappropriate and unnecessary topics such as Critical Race Theory; \nDiversity,  Equity,  and  Inclusion  (DEI);  social  justice  activism; \n“anti-racism”;  and  instruction  on  white  privilege  and  white \nsupremacy. Additionally, many of these grants included teacher and \nstaff recruiting strategies implicitly and explicitly based on race. \n \nThe grants are awarded to teacher preparation programs that train \nfuture classroom teachers. Examples from the grant applications \nincluded: \n•  Requiring  practitioners  to  take  personal  and  institutional \nresponsibility for systemic inequities (e.g., racism) and critically \nreassess their own practices;  \n•  Receiving  professional  development  workshops  and  equity \ntraining on topics such as “Building Cultural Competence,” \n“Dismantling  Racial  Bias”  and  “Centering  Equity  in  the \nClassroom”; \n•  Acknowledging and responding to systemic forms of oppression \nand  inequity,  including  racism,  ableism,  “gender-based” \ndiscrimination, homophobia, and ageism; \n•  Providing  “targeted  practices  in  culturally  relevant  and \nresponsive  teaching  abolitionist  pedagogies  and  issues  of \ndiversity in classroom management”; and \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 28 of 48\n•  Providing  spaces  for  critical  reflection  to  help  educators \nconfront biases and have transformative conversations about \nequity. \n \n(ECF No. 1-4.)   \n  For comparison, the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 provides:  \nEach agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with \nthe Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of \nOPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty \ndays of this order: \n \n(i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, \nand “environmental justice” offices and positions (including but not \nlimited to “Chief Diversity Officer” positions); all “equity action \nplans,” “equity” actions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” \ngrants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements \nfor employees, contractors, or grantees. \n \nExec. Order No. 14,151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and \nPreferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025).   \nBeyond referencing “DEI,” the court does not discern substantially similar language, which \nis to say, it is not in fact “clear,” as Plaintiffs allege, that the Department terminated the Grant \nAwards at issue pursuant to the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ \n48.)  Plaintiffs’ papers otherwise offer no other argument or evidence in support of its allegation.  \nAt the hearing, Plaintiffs confirmed that the circumstantial evidence upon which they rely in \nsupport of this allegation is that of timing and presidential authority—the Termination Letters were \nissued within the required timeframe under the Termination Provision (60 days) ordered by \nPresident Trump. \nDefendants also argue that the record before the court demonstrates that the Department \ndid not terminate the Grant Awards as a means to comply with Executive Order 14151, or, \nalternatively, the record sufficiently undermines Plaintiffs’ theory and conclusion that Executive \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 29 of 48\nOrder 14141 and the Termination Letters (and the February 2025 Press Release) are plainly and \nobviously connected.  The court agrees with Defendants on this point.  The Department’s Directive \ncites as authority 28 U.S.C. § 3411 and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–341, and directs Department \npersonnel to “conduct an internal review of all . . . grants” to “ensur[e] that Department grants do \nnot fund discriminatory practices—including in the form of DEI—that are either contrary to law \nor to the Department’s policy objectives, as well as to ensure that all grants are free from fraud, \nabuse, and duplication.”  (February 2025 Directive, ECF No. 24-2.)  The Directive, as Defendants \nnote, makes no reference to Executive Order 14151 or President Trump.  Further, importantly, the \nDirective preceded the NADOHE preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Termination \nProvision, which is to say, at the time of the Directive, the Department had no incentive or motive \nto omit reference to Executive Order 14151, because the Termination Provision had not yet been \nenjoined in NADOHE.  See NADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, supra.10  \nThe circumstantial evidence offered by Plaintiffs does not demonstrate a clear likelihood \nof  success  on  their  Fifth  Amendment  claim  where  that  claim  necessarily  requires  that  the \nTermination Provision was the source of the Grant Award terminations.  Said another way, the \nrecord before the court at this time fails to demonstrate that the Department likely terminated the \nGrant Awards at the directive of Executive Order 14151.  The evidence Plaintiffs rely upon to rest \nthat conclusion is simply too tenuous to serve as the cornerstone for the extraordinary relief of a \n \n10 Defendants also point to correspondence offered in the NADOHE case from the FCC Chair stating that the FCC \nwas ending the FCC’s “promotion” of DEI pursuant to the policies expressed in President Trump’s Executive Order.  \nNADOHE, 2025 WL 573764, at *7. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 30 of 48\npreliminary injunction.11   As such, Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden to show they are likely to \nsucceed on their Fifth Amendment challenge.12   \nb.  Administrative Procedure Act Claim  \nThe APA instructs a reviewing court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency actions \nfound to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  “A disputed action also may be set aside as arbitrary and capricious if the \nagency has acted ‘without observance of procedure required by law.’”  Safari Club Int’l v. Zinke, \n878 F.3d 316, 325 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (first quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D); then citing Meister v. U.S. \nDep’t of Agric., 623 F.3d 363, 371 (6th Cir. 2010) (noting that “even in cases arising under § \n706(2)(D), the arbitrary-and-capricious standard frequently governs.”)); see also Ctr. for Sci. in \nthe Pub. Int. v. Perdue, 438 F. Supp. 3d 546, 557 (D. Md. 2020) (same).  As discussed above, \njudicial review is appropriate here, as the parties agree, as does the court, that the Termination \nLetters constituted final agency action.   \nIn deciding whether a final agency action is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law,” the reviewing court determines “only whether the \n[agency] examined ‘the relevant data’ and articulated ‘a satisfactory explanation’ for [its] decision, \n‘including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  5 U.S.C. § \n \n11 Further, as the court expressed at the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiffs neglect to consider that Acting Secretary \nCarter and Secretary McMahon may well share President Trump’s views and opinions regarding DEI and equity-\nbased programs and grants as expressed in Executive Order 14151.  Indeed, one might expect that to be the case.  That \nExecutive Order 14151 may have, by its terms mandated precisely the action taken by the Department in terminating \nthe Grant Awards does not mean the Department terminated the Grant Awards because it was ordered to do so – as \nopposed to because the Department head devised her own action items for the Department going forward; or based on \nsome combination of same. \n12 Because the court concludes Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a clear showing of likelihood of success on the merits on \ntheir Fifth Amendment claim for failure to relate adequately the Termination Letters to the Termination Provision of \nExecutive Order 14151, it does not address Defendants’ arguments related to the principle that “[t]he degree of \nvagueness that the Constitution tolerates—as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement—\ndepends in part on the nature of the enactment.”  Vill. of Hoffman Ests. v. Flipside, Hoffman Ests., Inc., 455 U.S. 489, \n498 (1982).  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 31 of 48\n706(2)(A); Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019) (quoting Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  \nThe court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.  FCC v. Prometheus \nRadio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).   \nAn agency action qualifies as “arbitrary” or “capricious” if it is not “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.”  Id.  “Generally, an agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if ‘the \nagency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a \ndifference in view or the product of agency expertise.’”  Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of the \nInterior, 899 F.3d 260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43). \n“Deciding whether agency action was adequately explained requires, first, knowing where \nto look for the agency’s explanation.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 \nU.S. 1, 20 (2020).  “It is a ‘foundational principle of administrative law’ that judicial review of \nagency action is limited to ‘the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.’” Id. \n(quoting Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 758 (2015)); see also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50 (noting \n“[i]t is well-established that an agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by \nthe agency itself”). \nTo remind the reader, the Termination Letters state as follows: \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation  is  terminating  your  federal  award,  [Grant  Award \nnumber]. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340–43; see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.523. \n \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 32 of 48\nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment's grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education. In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess whether current grants are in the best interests of the United \nStates. \n \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States. The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer \neffectuates, Department priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see \nalso  34  C.F.R.  §  75.253.  Therefore,  pursuant  to,  among  other \nauthorities, 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the \ntermination provisions in your grant award, the Department hereby \nterminates grant No. [___] in its entirety effective [February ___, \n2025]. \n \n(ECF No. 1-2.) \ni.  Rule Making Requirements \nThe Department primarily relies upon two sections of the Code of Federal Regulations: § \n200.340 and § 75.253.  Sections 200.339 and 341–43, also cited, provide additional notification \nrequirements for terminations described in § 200.340.  At oral argument, Plaintiffs stated, and the \nDefendants did not dispute, that § 75.253 has no application here, because § 75.253 prescribes the \nprocedure for “Continuation of a Multiyear Project after the First Budget Period” – and no Grant \nRecipient was in such a position relative to the Termination Letter.     \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 33 of 48\nSection 200.340 provides: \n \n(a) The Federal award may be terminated in part or its entirety as \nfollows: \n \n(1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the \nrecipient  or  subrecipient  fails  to  comply  with  the  terms  and \nconditions of the Federal award; \n \n(2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the \nconsent of the recipient or subrecipient, in which case the two parties \nmust  agree  upon  the  termination  conditions.  These  conditions \ninclude the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the \nportion to be terminated; \n \n(3) By the recipient or subrecipient upon sending the Federal \nagency or pass-through entity a written notification of the reasons \nfor such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial \ntermination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal \nagency or pass-through entity determines that the remaining portion \nof the Federal award will not accomplish the purposes for which the \nFederal award was made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity \nmay terminate the Federal award in its entirety; or \n \n(4) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to \nthe terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the \nextent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities. \n \n(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and \nunambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award. \n \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)–(b) (2025). \nThe Grant Recipients’ GANs incorporate § 200.340 in their terms and conditions.13  (ECF \nNo.  25-2.)    Accordingly,  in  compliance  with  §  200.340(b),  the  Department  included  the \n \n13 In relevant part, the GANs read: “2 CFR Part 200 as adopted at 2 CFR 3474.”  (ECF No. 25-2 at pp. 17, 91.)  Section \n3474.1 is titled “Adoption of 2 CFR part 200” and reads: “(a) The Department of Education adopts the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) Guidance in 2 CFR part 200, except for 200.102(a) and 2 CFR 200.207(a).  Thus, \nthis part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department. \n(b) The authority for all of the provisions in 2 CFR part 200 as adopted in this part is listed as follows. (Authority: 20 \nU.S.C. 1221e-3, 3474, and 2 CFR part 200).”  2 C.F.R. § 3474.1.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 34 of 48\ntermination provisions set forth in § 200.340(a) in the GANs provided to the Grant Recipients.  \nThe parties’ dispute, therefore, concerns whether the February 2025 Grant Terminations complied \nwith § 200.340(a)(4).   \nPlaintiffs argue that “agency priorities” as used in § 200.340(a)(4) and the Termination \nLetters is a term of art.  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 5.)14  As relates to the Department, Plaintiffs insist, \n“agency priorities” cannot be changed without going through public notice and comment rule \nmaking.  Id. at p. 10.  Defendants dispute this contention and instead suggest “agency priorities” \nrefers to broader (“big-picture”) agency policy aims, set by each administration or Secretary, and \nare not required to go through public notice and comment processes.  (ECF No. 24 at pp. 24–25.)  \nDefendants may be correct as it relates to other agencies, but, as discussed below, Plaintiffs \npersuade the court for purposes of the Motion that Department “agency priorities” may change \nonly pursuant to APA notice and comment processes.    \n  In 2020, § 200.340 was amended to allow, for the first time, an agency to terminate a \nfederal award for failure to “effectuate agency priorities.”  Previously, a federal agency was \nentitled to terminate a federal award for the reasons currently listed at § 200.340(a)(1)–(3) or for \ncause.  2 C.F.R. 200.399 (2019).  The comments to this change acknowledge:  \nThe intent of this change is to ensure that Federal awarding agencies \nprioritize ongoing support to Federal awards that meet program \ngoals.  For instance, following the issuance of a Federal award, if \nadditional  evidence  reveals  that  a  specific  award  objective  is \nineffective  at  achieving  program  goals,  it  may  be  in  the \ngovernment’s interest to terminate the Federal award. \n \nGuidance for Grants and Agreements, Published Doc.

In at least two other instances since President Trump’s 2025 inauguration, courts addressed \n \n14 Plaintiffs assert “program goals” are also a term of art and refer to program goals established by Congress.  At the \nhearing, Defendants agreed that “program goals” are not relevant or at issue here.   \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 35 of 48\nterminations  of  federal  awards  by  the  United  States  Department  of  State  pursuant  to  § \n200.340(a)(4).  See Aids Vaccine Advoc. Coal. V. United States Dep’t of State, No. CV 25-00400 \n(AHA), — F. Supp. 3d — , 2025 WL 752378, at *12, n.10 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) (describing \n“waves of suspension and termination notices with boilerplate language” advising programs were \nsuspended “because the award ‘no longer effectuates agency priorities and is terminated in \naccordance with the U.S. Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions and 2 C.F.R. \n200.340’”);  United States Conf. of Catholic Bishops v. U.S. Dept. of State, No.1:25-CV-00465 \n(TNM), — F. Supp. 3d — , 2025 WL 763738, at *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025) (noting “the \njustification behind the termination was simple: the agreements ‘no longer effectuate[d] agency \npriorities.’ [] PRM thus terminated the awards ‘in accordance with the U.S. Department of State \nStandard Terms and Conditions, 2 C.F.R. 200.340’”).  No party cites, and the court is unaware of, \nanother instance of the Department terminating federal awards under § 200.340(a)(4).  See ECF \nNo. 24 at p. 26 (noting the “relatively untested” nature of and “paucity of caselaw interpreting” § \n200.340).  \nUnder § 200.340(a)(4), an award termination for failure to effectuate (program goals or) \nagency priorities is limited to “the extent authorized by law.”  With important exceptions the court \nwill shortly address, the APA’s rule making requirements do not apply to “a matter relating to . . . \ngrants.”  5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2).  Critically, this exemption does not apply to the Department.       \n  The General Education Provisions Act (“GEPA”)—(applicable to the Department under \nTitle 20 of the United States Code)—provides: \nThe exemption for . . . grants . . . in section 553(a)(2) of Title 5 shall \napply only to regulations— \n \n(1) that  govern  the  first  grant  competition  under  a  new  or \nsubstantially revised program authority as determined by the \nSecretary; or \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 36 of 48\n \n(2) where the Secretary determines that the requirements of this \nsubsection  will  cause  extreme  hardship  to  the  intended \nbeneficiaries of the program affected by such regulations. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1232(d).  Neither of these exceptions is present here.  \nA “regulation,” as used in the above section, is “any generally applicable rule, regulation, \nguideline, interpretation, or other requirement that – (1) is prescribed by the Secretary or the \nDepartment; and (2) has legally binding effect in connection with, or affecting, the provision of \nfinancial assistance under any applicable program.”  20 U.S.C. 1232(a).  GEPA thereby limits the \nAPA’s rule making exemption for grants to two circumstances—neither of which applies to the \nGrant Recipients’ awards  .  All other Department regulations, including its “agency priorities,” \nare subject to 5 U.S.C. § 553 notice and comment rule making.15     \n  Defendants’ argument that “Plaintiff’s interpretation of federal regulation renders every \nfederal agency powerless to shift its activities with new Presidential administrations absent a \nlengthy public rulemaking process” ignores GEPA’s specific application to the Department’s \npurported change of “priorities” at issue here.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 26.)  Defendants’ assertion that \nthe “priorities” referred to in the Termination Letters are “general and issued at the discretion of \nthe Agency or the Administration” and “can be changed at any time without a vote or notice and \ncomment from the public” is utterly at odds with GEPA.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 26.)  Under GEPA, \n \n15 Plaintiffs persuasively explain: “[i]n sum, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department must \ngo through the notice and comment rulemaking process;” “while there are limited exceptions to this rule, none of the \nexceptions are applicable to the analysis here.”  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 5 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d) and 34 C.F.R. § \n75.105(b)(2)); see ECF No. 1 ¶ 24 (“In other words, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department \nmust go through notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the [§ 1232(d)] exceptions applies.”)  \nDefendants do not argue that any exception to the APA rule making process applies here; instead, they argue generally \nthat neither cited authority applies.  (ECF No. 24 at p. 25 (“These provisions do not support Plaintiffs’ argument. § \n1232(d) governs regulations and § 75.105(b)(2) governs annual priorities.”)) Section 75.105 provides instruction for \npriorities used in the selection of grant recipients; it falls under subparts “How To Apply for a Grant” and “The \nApplication Notice.”  Section 1232(d) applies to “regulations,” but Defendants offer no argument why § 200.340(a)(4) \n“agency priorities” are not “regulations” as defined in § 1232(a).  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 37 of 48\n‘department priorities’ are established by the Secretary or Department and grant recipients must \nabide them to avoid award cancellation – which is to say, they are legally binding on the federal \naward recipient.  As a matter of law, therefore, such “priorities” – including those on which the \nTermination Letters were based – must go through public notice and comment rule making.   \nThe Grant Recipients’ Grant Awards were terminated upon the Department’s supposed \nfinding that “[t]he grant is . . . inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.”  \n(ECF No. 1-2.)  Nothing in the administrative record before the court supports, or tends to support, \nthis conclusion or the veracity of the statement itself – which is to say, nothing in the record \nsupports, or tends to support, a conclusion that, in fact, any Grant Program award was inconsistent \nwith, or no longer effectuated, Department priorities as had been previously established through \nthe statutorily mandated public notice and comment rule making process.  Nothing before the court \nsupports, or tends to support, a conclusion that in fact the Department reviewed the grant award of \neach Grant Recipient and, on such review, in fact, found it to run afoul of previously lawfully \nestablished “agency priorities.”  Defendants present no evidence of public notice and comment \nrule making through which its priorities (on which the Grant Recipients received their Grant \nAwards) underwent amendment or change.  (See ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 25–28 and Federal Register \nauthorities cited therein regarding Notices of Final Priorities establishing agency priorities used in \nselection of the Grant Recipients.)  Instead, Defendants urge that the Department, embarking on a \nnew presidential administration, is entitled to make “big-picture” priority changes free from the \nconstraints of GEPA and the APA, and was therefore free to terminate the Grant Recipients’ \nawards on the basis that the Department essentially changed its mind. \nPlaintiffs have made a clear showing that the Department’s termination of the Grant \nRecipients’ Grant Program awards violates the APA.  Specifically, Plaintiffs make a clear showing \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 38 of 48\nthat the Department did not change, modify, or alter the agency priorities (which are regulatory in \nnature and effect) on which the Department based the Grant Recipients’ Grant Awards.  Plaintiffs \nalso make a clear showing that the Department did not notify Grant Recipients that their programs \nwere inconsistent with, or violated, agency policies, as required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, and which \nthe Department cites in the Termination Letter.  (See, e.g., MACTE Decl., ECF No. 25-2, attesting \nthat prior to the Termination Letter, no MACTE Grant Recipient had received “notice, written or \notherwise, that the grant administered by [the Grant Recipient] engaged in any of the activities \ndescribed in the termination letter.”)  Defendants do not assert that, prior to issuance of the \nTermination Letters, any Grant Recipient was notified of such policy violation or non-compliance \n(despite the Termination Letter’s citation to C.F.R. § 200.341 as supportive authority for its \naction).   \nFor these reasons, the court concludes that Plaintiffs have made a clear showing of \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their APA claim.  Specifically, the court finds that the \nDepartment’s Termination Letter, and the Department’s termination of the Grant Recipients’ Grant \nAwards are likely to be proven arbitrary and capricious, because the Department’s action was \nunreasonable,  not  reasonably  explained,  based  on  factors  Congress  had  not  intended  the \nDepartment to consider (i.e., not agency priorities), and otherwise not in accordance with law.16  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Dep’t of Commerce v.

United States Dep’t of the \nInterior, 899 F.3d 260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018).  \n \n \n \n16 The record before the court also supports a finding of likelihood of success on the basis that the Department’s action \nwas “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 39 of 48\nii.  Termination Letter Grounds \nEven  crediting  Defendants’  assertions  that  the  “agency  priorities”  referenced  in  the \nTermination Letters are not subject to notice and comment rule making, and that the Department \nfollowed procedure required by law in issuing the Termination Letters, Plaintiffs still make a clear \nshowing of likelihood of success on their APA claim because the Termination Letters fail to \nprovide Grant Recipients any workable, sensible, or meaningful reason or basis for the termination \nof their awards.  Plaintiffs correctly observe: “the form letters failed to provide basic notice by \nomitting  any  specificity  about  the  reason  that  the  Department  found  any  individual  grant \n‘inconsistent with . . . Department priorities.’ The letters merely list, disjunctively, five vague ways \nin which the specific grants at issue might be ‘inconsistent.’”17  (ECF No. 5-1 n.10.)  The court \nagrees.   \nThe Department has not provided the “reasonable explanation” of its final agency action \nthe APA requires.  Prometheus, 592 U.S. at 423.  The Termination Letter’s list of ways in which \na Grant Recipient’s program is “inconsistent” with Department priorities is so broad and vague as \nto be limitless; devoid of import, even.  Coupled with the disjunctive nature of the list (“. . . or that \notherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States”), the Termination Letter effectively \nand practically renders meaningless the right to appeal, which, as described in the Termination \nLetter, requires a written appeal to be submitted within 30 days containing a “brief statement of \nyour argument and the disputed factual, legal, or other issues.”  (ECF No. 1-2.)  Inasmuch as the \nTermination Letter at once accuses a Grant Recipient of nothing and everything, it is utterly unclear \n \n17 The Termination Letters provide in pertinent part: “The grant specified above provides funding for programs that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal \ncivil rights law; that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; \nthat are not free from fraud, abuse, or duplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States.”  \n(ECF No. 1-2.) \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 40 of 48\nto the court how a terminated Grant Recipient might mount such an appeal.  How does one draft a \n“brief statement” of a “disputed” fact when one has no earthly idea what has been asserted, if \nanything? \nA reasonable explanation considers relevant data and articulates a satisfactory explanation \nfor the agency’s decision, “including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.”  Dep’t of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  The \nDepartment has not provided a satisfactory explanation of the facts found or the choice made, \nmuch less a rational connection between the two.  The Termination Letter fails to mention or refer \nto data or information the Department considered, if any, in deciding that the Grant Programs no \nlonger effectuate Department priorities.  Further, the Department’s use of a template or boilerplate \nletter issued to all Grant Recipients further strengthens Plaintiffs’ argument that the Department \ndid not consider individual, or any, data or information.  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., — F. \nSupp. 3d. — , No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825, at *3 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025) (finding \nthe same Termination Letter “does not reach the level of a reasoned explanation; indeed it amounts \nto no explanation at all”). \niii. Oglesby California Case Declaration   \n  On the eve of the hearing, Defendants, with Plaintiffs’ consent, offered for the court’s \nconsideration a declaration of Rachel Oglesby, Chief of Staff of the Department, which bears the \ncaption of, and was offered in, the California case.  (Hearing Ex. No. 2.)  In the declaration, Ms. \nOglesby attests to the Department’s “individualized review process” of “every grant issued under \nthe [TQP] Program and the [SEED] Program.”  Id. ¶¶ 6, 7.  At the hearing here, Defendants did \nnot rely on Ms. Oglesby’s declaration to oppose Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious argument.  \nNonetheless, inasmuch as the declaration is before the court, the court addresses its significance.    \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 41 of 48\n  In reviewing a final agency action, the court “‘consider[s] the record made before the \nagency at the time the agency acted,’ so ‘post-hoc rationalizations . . . have traditionally been found \nto be an inadequate basis for review.’”  Roe v. Dep’t of Defense, 947 F.3d 207, 220 (4th Cir. 2020) \n(quoting Dow AgroSciences LLC v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 707 F.3d 462, 467–68 (4th Cir. \n2013)).  Courts may consider “affidavits not contained in the agency record . . . where ‘there was \nsuch failure to explain administrative action as to frustrate effective judicial review.’” Dow \nAgroSciences, 707 F.3d at 468 (quoting Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142–43 (1973)).  Such post-\nhoc materials, however, must only provide “background information or evidence of whether all \nrelevant factors were examined by an agency,” or be “merely explanatory of the original record \nand . . . contain no new rationalizations.” AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 810 F.2d \n1233, 1236 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).  \nEven if credited as “background information” or “merely explanatory of the original \nrecord,” Ms. Oglesby’s declaration, regarding plaintiffs in another case, fails to rescue Defendants \nfrom the unavoidable conclusion that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA \nclaim.    Ms.  Oglesby’s  declaration  fails  to  remedy  that  the  Termination  Letter  evinces  no \nindividualized consideration of Grant Recipient awards and does not shed light on which of the \npossible grounds for termination set forth in the disjunctive list applies to a Termination Letter \nrecipient.  Further, nothing in Ms. Oglesby’s declaration suggests that any of the unnamed grants \nMs. Oglesby describes are at issue in this action.  See Hearing Ex. No. 2 ¶¶ 11–16 (offering reasons \nwhy five unnamed grants were terminated); id. ¶ 24 (“The [Termination] letters reasoned that the \nfunded programs ‘promote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully \ndiscriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; . . . violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict with \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 42 of 48\nthe Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; . . . are not free \nfrom fraud, abuse, or duplication; or … otherwise fail to serve the best interest of the United \nStates.” (ellipses in original)). \n2.  Irreparable Harm  \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must “demonstrate that irreparable injury is \nlikely in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) \n(emphasis in original) (citing cases).  “To establish irreparable harm, the movant must make a \n‘clear showing’ that it will suffer harm that is ‘neither remote nor speculative, but actual and \nimminent.’”  Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres of Land, Owned by Sandra Townes \nPowell, 915 F.3d 197, 216 (4th Cir. 2019) (quoting Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., \n952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991)).  Irreparable harm is harm that “cannot be fully rectified by the \nfinal judgment after trial.”  Id.  (quoting Stuller, Inc. v. Steak N Shake Enters., 695 F.3d 676, 680 \n(7th Cir. 2012)).   \nWhile  “[m]ere  injuries,  however  substantial,  in  terms  of  money,  time  and  energy \nnecessarily expended in the absence of [an injunction] are not enough,” see Roe v. Dep’t of Def., \n947 F.3d 207, 228 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Jan. 14, 2020) (quoting Di Biase v. SPX Corp., \n872  F.3d  224,  230  (4th  Cir.  2017)),  “irreparable  harm  may  still  occur  in  extraordinary \ncircumstances, such as when monetary damages are unavailable or unquantifiable.”  Handsome \nBrook Farm, LLC v. Humane Farm Animal Care, Inc., 700 F. App’x 251, 263 (4th Cir. 2017).   \nFor instance, “economic damages may constitute irreparable harm where no remedy is available \nat the conclusion of litigation.”  Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. W. Pocahontas Properties Ltd. \nP’ship, 918 F.3d 353, 366 (4th Cir. 2019).  Similarly, harm that “threaten[s] a party’s very \nexistence” can qualify as irreparable.  Mountain Valley Pipeline, 915 F.3d at 218.   \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 43 of 48\nPlaintiffs  contend  they will  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction because Grant Recipients are – in this moment – deprived of “essential funding required \nto  continue  their  teacher  preparation  programs  and  the  deprivation  “complete  eviscerates[] \nPlaintiffs’ missions.”18  (ECF No. 5-1 at pp. 25–28.)  For purposes of the Motion, Defendants do \nnot dispute Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.  (ECF No. 24 at \np. 27.)   \nPlaintiffs have made a clear showing that their members will suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of an injunction.  According to the supporting declarations, the loss of funding will cause \nsome Grant Recipients to shutter their programs entirely.  (NCTR Decl., ECF No. 5-4 ¶ 14; AU \nDecl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13.)  Others will be forced to terminate staff that work on teacher preparation \nprograms and will be unable to provide funding to teachers set to start in their respective training \nprograms—teachers who often rely on such funding for their livelihoods.  (NCTR Decl., ECF No. \n5-4 ¶¶ 14–15; AU Decl., ECF No. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., ECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 13–14; Alder GSE Decl., \nECF No. 5-8 ¶ 13; Teaching Lab Decl., ECF No. 5-9 ¶ 19.)  Plaintiffs ably demonstrate that they \nwill suffer irreparable harm that is both actual and imminent absent a preliminary injunction—\nharm that will affect the existence of Grant Recipients’ programs as well as the livelihoods of \nindividuals within the affected teacher preparation programs.   \n \n \n \n18  As to Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the impact on their missions, the Fourth Circuit has indicated that where an \norganizational plaintiff’s standing is based on a representation theory (as is the case with respect to AACTE and \nMACTE, but not as to NCTR), district courts should look at the irreparable harm to its members.  N. Carolina State \nConf. of the NAACP v. Raymond, 981 F.3d 295, 311 n.9 (4th Cir. 2020).   \n \nPlaintiffs also assert irreparable harm in the form of a likely constitutional violation, see ECF No. 5-1 at p. 24; this \nargument is unavailing in view of the court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs have not made a clear showing that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their Fifth Amendment claim.   \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 44 of 48\n3.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest  \nFinally, “Plaintiffs must show ‘that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor’ and ‘that \nan injunction is in the public interest.’”  Pierce v. N. Carolina State Bd. of Elections, 97 F.4th 194, \n225 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  When, \nas here, the Government is the party opposing a motion for preliminary injunction, the balance of \nequities and public interest factors merge.  Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 365 (4th Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  Courts “must balance the competing claims \nof injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested \nrelief,” with “particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy \nof injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, AK, 480 U.S. \n531, 542 (1987)); see Ass’n of Am. Publishers, Inc. v. Frosh, 586 F. Supp. 3d 379, 397 (D. Md. \n2022) (same).  The court considers “the ‘harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is erroneously denied \nversus harm to the defendant if the injunction is erroneously granted.’”  Students for Fair \nAdmissions v. United States Naval Acad., 707 F. Supp. 3d 486, 509 (D. Md. 2023) (quoting \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Adams, 937 F.3d 973, 980 (7th Cir. 2019)).   \nPlaintiffs argue that the balance of equities favors them – where a preliminary injunction \nwould restore “the status quo . . . had the Department not unlawfully terminated” the Grant \nAwards.  (ECF No. 5-1 at p. 30.)  Absent an injunction, Plaintiffs assert, the Grant Recipients’ \nteaching preparation programs risk closure.  Id. at pp. 30–31.  Defendants, in turn, argue that \n“several compelling interests” weigh against an injunction, referring to the Government’s and \nsome citizens’ interest in “ending discrimination” in the form of DEI policies, a cornerstone of \nPresident Trump’s reelection.  (ECF No. 24 at pp. 27–29.)   \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 45 of 48\nDefendants’ arguments miss the mark insofar as the Winter factors are concerned.  The \ninquiry the court is obliged to undertake requires the balancing of harm if the injunction is \nerroneously granted as opposed to denied.  See Students for Fair Admissions, 707 F. Supp. 3d at \n509, supra.  In that vein, a member of the public who is opposed to government funding of Grant \nPrograms that relate to DEI does not outweigh the asserted concrete, irreparable harm in the form \nof programmatic closures, staff terminations, and loss of funding of teacher preparation programs \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members will experience should the injunction not issue.19  The harms \nPlaintiffs identify also implicate grave effect on the public: fewer teachers for students in high-\nneed neighborhoods, early childhood education, and special education programs.  (AU Decl., ECF \nNo. 5-6 ¶ 13; UST Decl., ECF No. 5-7 ¶¶ 6, 14–15.)  Moreover, even to the extent Defendants \nassert such an interest in ending DEI-based programs, they have sought to effect change by means \nthe court finds likely violate the law.  “[T]he public ‘undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its \ngovernmental institutions follow the law.’”  Vitkus v. Blinken, 79 F.4th 352, 368 (4th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 230–31).   \nThe balance of equities and public interest favor issuance of a preliminary injunction.   \nD.  Appropriate Scope of the Preliminary Injunction  \nHaving determined that Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction, the court turns \nnow to the proper scope of the injunction.20  “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of \n \n19 At the hearing, Defendants asserted that individual participants in these teacher preparation programs may be \nharmed by “believing their success . . . [to be] unearned.” See ECF No. 24 at p. 28 (quoting Students for Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 275–76 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring)).  \nInasmuch as individuals are free to participate in such programs, or not, this is unpersuasive with respect to the Motion.  \n20 Defendants request that, if the court is inclined to grant a preliminary injunction, it should instead remand the matter \nto the Department, so that it may provide a more detailed explanation for the terminations on an expedited schedule.  \n(ECF No. 24 at p. 29.)  In the time since Defendants’ filing, there have been significant reductions in force at the \nDepartment, which defense counsel acknowledged at the hearing consistent with her duties of candor to the court.  In \naccordance with her duties as an officer of the court, defense counsel expressed that she did not know whether \nexpedited review remained possible.  Regardless, Defendants’ request for remand is not compelling here, where they \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 46 of 48\ndiscretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance \nof the legal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579 \n(2017).  Federal district courts possess “wide discretion to fashion appropriate injunctive relief in \na particular case.”  Roe v. Dep’t of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 231 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Jan. 14, \n2020) (quoting Richmond Tenants Org., Inc. v. Kemp, 956 F.2d 1300, 1308 (4th Cir. 1992)).  At \nthe same time, courts also “must ensure that ‘a preliminary injunction is no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.’”  HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, \n985 F.3d 309, 326 (4th Cir. 2021) (quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 231).  The court “may issue a \nnationwide injunction so long as [it] ‘mold[s] its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular \ncase.’”  Id. (quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 231).  “[A] nationwide injunction may be appropriate when \nthe government relies on a ‘categorical policy,’ and when the facts would not require different \nrelief for others similarly situated to the plaintiffs.”  Id. (quoting Roe, 947 F.3d at 232–33).   \n   With the aforementioned principles in mind, the court concludes the following scope is no \nmore burdensome than necessary to provide complete relief to Plaintiffs and those similarly \nsituated,  and  subject  to  the  Termination  Letter,  or  substantially  the  same  Grant  Program \ntermination letters, pursuant to the Department’s apparent categorical policy.  See HIAS, 985 F.3d \nat 326, supra.  By separate order, issued herewith, Defendants are ordered to reinstate the Grant \nAwards for Plaintiffs’ members who are Grant Recipients (including NCTR), in accordance with \nthe GAN Terms and Conditions in place immediately prior to the Termination Letters.  The court \nwill further order that Defendants shall not undertake to terminate, or terminate, any TQP, SEED, \nand TSL awards in a manner this court has determined is likely unlawful as violative of the APA \nas described herein.       \n \nfail to state or to propose a time frame within which Plaintiffs’ members complaints addressed herein could be \nevaluated.   \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 47 of 48\nE.  Security \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), this court “may issue a preliminary \ninjunction . . . only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay \nthe costs  and damages  sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c).  “This rule is mandatory and unambiguous.”  Hoechst Diafoil \nCo. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 421 (4th Cir. 1999) (citing District 17, UMWA v. A & \nM Trucking, Inc., 991 F.2d 108, 110 (4th Cir. 1993)).   \nIn determining the amount of an injunction bond, courts “should be guided by the purpose \nunderlying Rule 65(c), which is to provide a mechanism for reimbursing an enjoined party for \nharm it suffers as a result of an improvidently issued injunction or restraining order”; the inquiry \nthus “ordinarily depends on the gravity of the potential harm to the enjoined party.”  Hoechst \nDiafoil, 174 F.3d at 421 n.3.  While bond is mandatory, the court has discretion “to set the bond \namount ‘in such sum as the court deems proper,’” including a bond in a nominal amount or in the \namount of zero.  See id. at 421 n.3 (citations omitted) (discussing a nominal bond); Maryland Dep’t \nof Hum. Res. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 976 F.2d 1462, 1483 n.23 (4th Cir. 1992) (discussing a \nnominal bond amount of zero).  Indeed, a nominal bond approach “has long been followed in \npublic-interest litigation cases.”  State of Maryland, et al., v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, et al., — \nF. Supp. 3d — , No. CV JKB-25-0748, 2025 WL 800216, at *26 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025) (citing \ncases).    \nPlaintiffs here request that no bond, or alternatively a nominal bond, be required.  (ECF \nNo. 5-1 at p. 31.)  At the hearing on the Motion, defense counsel stated that Defendants did not \noppose Plaintiffs’ request for no bond.  Defendants subsequently filed a notice advising of their \nchange of position and requesting bond amount “equal to the Federal Government’s potential costs \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00702-JRR     Document 32     Filed 03/17/25     Page 48 of 48\nand damages from a wrongly issued injunction,” per President Trump’s March 11, 2025 Executive \nOrder titled “Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).”  (ECF Nos. 30, \n30-1.)  Defendants now seek a bond, because injunctive relief “would potentially mandate that the \nExecutive spend money that may not be recouped once distributed.”  (ECF No. 30.)  Defendants \ndo not request a specific amount in bond; and this and other courts have imposed a nominal bond \nupon such unsupported speculations.  See, e.g., PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, 2025 \nWL 685124, at *32 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025); Washington v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-00244-LK, 2025 \nWL 659057, at *28 n.29 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025).  Cf. Hoechst Diafoil Co., 174 F.3d at 421 \nn.3 (explaining that where the risk of harm to an enjoined party is “remote,” “a nominal bond may \nsuffice”).    \nIn view of the facts here, and where Defendants present no non-speculative assertion of \npotential costs and damages, the court finds a nominal bond is appropriate.  As far as the court can \ndiscern, and Defendants do not argue to the contrary, any financial cost Defendants may incur \nexisted prior to terminations of Grant Program awards at issue here.  The court will, therefore, set \na nominal bond in the amount of $100.00.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Motion (ECF No. 5) shall be granted in part and denied \nin part. \n \nMarch 17, 2025            /S/ \n     \n              Julie R.
