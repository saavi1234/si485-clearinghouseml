    "summary": "<p>On March 5, 2025, the National Endowment for Democracy filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, naming the United States, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and their corresponding agency heads as Defendants. Established by the National Endowment for Democracy Act (NED Act), the Plaintiff is a nonprofit whose mission is to \"encourage free and democratic institutions throughout the world through private sector initiatives.\" The NED Act directs that the Endowment \"shall\" receive annual grants through the Department of State. However, the complaint alleged that since January 22, 2025, the executive branch had denied the Plaintiff access to its congressionally appropriated funds. The Endowment alleged that by withholding the funds, the Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Additionally, the Plaintiff alleged that the acting agency heads violated the Mandamus Act, the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, the Spending Clause, the Take Care Clause, and separation of powers. The Endowment was represented by private counsel and sought injunctive relief and attorney fees. The case was assigned to Judge Dabney L. Friedrich.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2025, the Endowment filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking to stop Defendants from impounding or otherwise interfering with the Endowment's congressionally mandated funding; the parties, on March 11, filed a motion to hold the TRO motion in abeyance, which the court granted that same day.</p>\r\n<p>The Endowment filed an amended complaint on June 30, 2025. The amended complaint added no new parties but did add significant facts detailing the Executive Branch's targeting of the Endowment, specifically by the Department of Government Efficiency, the Office of Management and Budget, and their heads. The amended complaint alleged that after the filing of the original complaint, the Executive Branch released approximately $97 million, on March 10, 2025, however OMB sought to find different methods of impounding allocated funds: First, by delaying and requiring additional documentation for the Endowment's drawdown requests, and second, by apportioning only part of the full-year appropriation on March 31 instead of apportioning the full amount. Given these additional factual allegations, the amended complaint added two new counts, asserting that reserving part of the appropriation violated both the APA and the Anti-Deficiency Act.</p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2025, the Endowment filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Defendants' withholding of the funds appropriated by Congress was clearly unlawful and a violation of the NED Act.&nbsp; On August 11, 2025, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, \"enjoining Defendants from withholding, blocking, reserving, or otherwise interfering with payment of appropriated funds for fiscal year 2025 to the Endowment, including by interfering with the apportionment, obligation, and ultimate disbursement of such funds.\" In granting the motion, the court concluded that the Endowment was likely to succeed on the merits of its APA claims. It cited the mandatory language of the NED Act and noted that, notwithstanding that language directing the Executive Branch to fund the Endowment, the record demonstrated that the Defendants were withholding funding for impermissible policy reasons. Withholding funds interfered with the statutory mandate that funding must enable the Endowment to carry out its purposes. The court explained that the Defendants could not permissibly withhold funding on the grounds that the Endowment's projects did not align with the Executive's priorities. It further reasoned that, in light of the conclusory and unreasoned justifications provided for withholding funds, the Endowment would likely succeed on its claim the the challenged action was arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, the court found that the loss of funds caused significant harm to the Endowment including loss of essential personnel and inability to fulfill obligations to grantees, and that the balance of equities and the public interest weighed in the Endowment's favor. Finally, the court denied the Defendants' request for an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. &nbsp;2025 WL 2305477.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Before the \nCourt is the plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.  Pl.’s Mot., Dkt. 40.  For the reasons \nthat follow, the Court will grant the plaintiff’s motion. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nNational  Endowment  for  Democracy  is  a  private,  nonprofit  organization  formally \nrecognized under the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983 (NED Act), 22 U.S.C. \n§§ 4411 et seq.  The Endowment’s mission is to “encourage free and democratic institutions \nthroughout the world through private sector initiatives, including activities which promote the \nindividual rights and freedoms (including internationally recognized human rights) which are \nessential to the functioning of democratic institutions.”  Id. § 4411(b).  As a grantmaking \norganization, the Endowment funds grantees both directly and through four “core institutes”: the \nInternational Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, the Center for International \nPrivate Enterprise, and the Solidarity Center.  Wilson TRO Decl. ¶¶ 3, 9, Dkt. 5-2.   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 2 of 15\nOn a yearly basis, the Endowment and its core institutes support approximately 2,000 \nnongovernmental projects in over 100 countries.  Id. ¶ 3.  The Endowment’s projects aim to \npromote “long-term U.S. interests by fostering stability, countering authoritarian influence, and \nreducing the drivers of extremism and migration.”  Wilson Supp. Decl. ¶ 3, Dkt. 40-2.  Grantees \nwork with local partners to, for example, “heighten public pressure on the Iranian regime by \nhighlighting government diversion of funds to opaque security and defense channels”; “identify, \nanalyze, monitor, and expose the Chinese Communist Party’s influence operations in South and \nSoutheast Asia”; and support “democratic activists . . . as they adapt and plan the next steps in \ntheir movements to counter . . . authoritarian regimes.”  Id. ¶ 74.  Many grantees operate in high-\nrisk environments, under oppressive regimes, and depend on the Endowment’s financial support.  \nId. ¶¶ 64, 74, 82. \nCongress funds the Endowment through annual appropriations.  The NED Act provides \nthat the State Department “shall make an annual grant to the Endowment to enable the Endowment \nto carry out its purposes” and that “[s]uch grants shall be made with funds specifically appropriated \nfor grants to the Endowment.”  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a).  When providing grants, the State Department \n“may not require the Endowment to comply with requirements other than those specified in” the \nAct.  Id.   \nEvery year since the Endowment’s founding in 1982, Congress has enacted appropriations \nthat the Endowment has received in full over the same fiscal year.  Wilson Supp. Decl. ¶ 32.  After \nCongress appropriates funding, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) “apportions” those \nfunds by setting a schedule to determine when they will become available to the relevant executive \nagency—here, the State Department.  See GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget \nProcess, GAO-05-734SP, at 12–13 (Sept. 1, 2005).  In recent years, OMB has apportioned the full \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 3 of 15\namount of the Endowment’s funds upon the enactment of a full-year appropriations law.  See Pl.’s \nMot., at 7 n.2.  The State Department then “obligates” those funds to the Endowment, and the \nmoney is set aside for the Endowment in its Treasury account.  See Wilson TRO Decl. ¶ 16.  The \nEndowment, and its grantees, obtain money on an as-needed periodic basis.  Wilson Supp. Decl. \n¶ 8 (“NED can only access the obligated funds [in its Treasury account] by regularly requesting \npayment drawdowns based on spending.”); id. ¶ 13 (“[A] grantee does not receive the full amount \nof the grant up front[.] . . . [P]ayments are tied to submission of scheduled progress reports and \nother deliverables.”). \nFor fiscal year 2024, Congress appropriated $315,000,000 in “no-year” funds for the \nEndowment’s use.  The relevant Further Consolidated Appropriations Act provided “[f]or grants \nmade by the Department of State to the National Endowment for Democracy, as authorized by the \nNational Endowment for Democracy Act (22 U.S.C. 4412), $315,000,000, to remain available \nuntil expended.”  Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 737 (2024).  For fiscal year 2025, Congress \npassed three continuing resolutions providing that same level of funding, “under the authority and \nconditions provided” in the 2024 appropriations act.  See Pub. L. No. 118-83, 138 Stat. 1524 \n(2024); Pub. L. No. 118-158, 138 Stat. 1722 (2024); Pub. L. No. 119-4, 139 Stat. 9 (2025).   “No-\nyear” appropriations—denoted by the “available until expended” language—are available for \nmultiple fiscal years and do not expire.  See GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law (Red \nBook), at 5-7 to 5-9 (3d ed. 2004); Wilson Supp. Decl. ¶ 7 (“Congress typically appropriates “no-\nyear” funds to the Endowment, which means that the money does not expire, affording the \nEndowment vital flexibility to fund long-term projects that incur expenses over multiple years.”).   \nAt the end of January 2025, the Endowment began encountering difficulties in accessing \nits money.  It did not receive roughly $97 million in routine drawdown requests from its Treasury \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 4 of 15\naccount,  and  the  State  Department  delayed  the  obligation  of  an  additional  $72  million  in \napportioned funds.  Wilson TRO Decl. ¶¶ 26–31.  Unable to meet ongoing operational costs, the \nEndowment was forced to furlough significant numbers of staff and default on obligations to \ngrantees.  Id. ¶¶ 35, 40. \nOn March 5, 2025, the Endowment filed suit.  Compl., Dkt. 1.  It also moved for a \ntemporary restraining order.  TRO Mot., Dkt. 5.  Five days later, on March 10, the Endowment \nreceived the $97 million in requested drawdowns and the State Department represented that it was \nin the process of obligating the additional $72 million in funds.  Dkt. 14.  The Court granted the \nparties’ request to hold these proceedings in abeyance.  See Minute Order of Mar. 11, 2025. \nThe defendants continued to slow-walk disbursements.  On March 13, after the Endowment \nsubmitted a $450,000 drawdown request, State Department officials informed the Endowment that \na “waiver” was required to access the funds.  Wilson Supp. Decl. ¶ 17.  The requirement was later \nwithdrawn and the Endowment received the requested funds on March 21.  Id.  In April and May, \nOMB apportioned funds to the Endowment in 30-day increments, deviating from its previous \npractice of making full annual appropriations available upon enactment.  Dkt. 17.  In early May, \nthe Director of OMB submitted a budget request for fiscal year 2026 to the Senate, proposing to \neliminate the Endowment’s funding entirely.  See Letter from Russell T. Vought, Dir., OMB, to \nSen. Susan Collins, Chair, Comm. on Appropriations (Vought Letter), at 3 (May 2, 2025), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-\nBudget-Request.pdf.  Id. \nLater that month, the State Department submitted a full-year spending plan to Congress \nthat did not contemplate any additional apportionments or obligations to the Endowment for fiscal \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 5 of 15\nyear 2025.  Administrative Record (AR) 3–4, Dkt. 39-1.  The spending plan provided that \nunobligated funds would be “subject to review for alignment with Administration priorities.”  Id. \nAs of early June, OMB had apportioned and the State Department had obligated only \nroughly $220 million of the $315 million in funds appropriated for the Endowment for fiscal year \n2025.  AR 3.  On June 11, government counsel informed the Endowment that no more funding \nwas forthcoming because the executive branch “contemplate[d] reserving” the remaining $95 \nmillion for “grants to NED for FY 2026.”  Am. Compl. Ex. A at 1, Dkt. 35-2.  Counsel explained \nthat, pursuant to the Antideficiency Act, “OMB is required to apportion no-year funds ‘to achieve \nthe most effective and economical use,’ 31 U.S.C. 1512(a), and funding in this case requires \napportionment for FY 2026 rather than additional obligations for FY 2025.”  Id.; see also AR 4 \n(declaration from State Department official asserting that “disbursing the [$95 million in] funds in \nFiscal Year 2026 would achieve the most effective and economical use of the remaining funds \nbecause sufficient funds had already been disbursed to NED for FY2025”). \nThe  Endowment  filed  a  renewed  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction  to  enjoin  the \ndefendants from withholding the remaining fiscal year 2025 appropriations.  See Pl.’s Mot.  The \nEndowment claims the withholding is contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority under \nthe NED Act and the Antideficiency Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C); arbitrary and capricious, id. \n§ 706(2)(A); and in violation of multiple constitutional provisions, id. § 706(2)(B).  On August 10, \nthe Court held a hearing on the motion.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  To prevail, \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 6 of 15\na party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must make a “clear showing that four factors, taken \ntogether, warrant relief: likely success on the merits, likely irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and accord with the public interest.”  \nLeague of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation modified).  \nWhere a federal agency is the defendant, the last two factors merge.  See Am. Immigr. Council v. \nDHS, 470 F. Supp. 3d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2020). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Court turns first to the Endowment’s likelihood of success on its APA claims.  Under \nthe APA, a reviewing court must set aside a final agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, \nan  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law”  or  “in  excess  of \nstatutory . . . authority.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  Absent exceptions not relevant here, id. \n§ 701(a), the APA authorizes judicial review of each “final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court,” id. § 704.1 \n1.  Violations of the NED Act and the Antideficiency Act \nThe Endowment claims that the defendants are violating the NED Act, by impeding the \nEndowment’s statutory purposes and by withholding funds for impermissible policy reasons.  The \nNED Act uses mandatory language directing the executive to fund the Endowment: It provides \nthat the State Department “shall make an annual grant to . . . enable the Endowment to carry out \nits purposes.”  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a) (emphasis added).  The statute also expressly defines the \nEndowment’s purposes, id. § 4411(b), and provides that compliance with those purposes should \n \n1 The defendants do not dispute that denial of the funding is a reviewable “final agency action.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 704; see Pl.’s Mot. at 15 n.10; see generally Opp’n, Dkt. 43. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 7 of 15\nbe “determine[d]” by the “Board of Directors of the Endowment,” id. § 4412(a).  And the statute \nlimits the executive branch’s discretion in imposing conditions on funding:  The State Department \nis prohibited from “requir[ing] the Endowment to comply with requirements other than those \nspecified” in the Act.  Id.  Instead, such policy oversight is the prerogative of Congress.  Id. \n§ 4412(d)  (“The  Endowment  and  its  grantees  shall  be  subject  to  the  appropriate  oversight \nprocedures of the Congress.”).  Tellingly, the defendants do not dispute that the Act prohibits the \nexecutive branch from imposing extra-statutory policy based conditions on the Endowment’s \nfunding.  See Hr’g Rough Tr. at 33 (agreeing that “the NED Act prohibits the executive branch \nfrom imposing any policy-based conditions on the Endowment’s funding, other than what’s in the \nstatute”). \nYet  record  evidence  clearly  shows  that  the  defendants  are  withholding  funding  for \nimpermissible  policy  reasons.    The  State  Department’s  full-year  spending  plan—the  sole \ndocument in the administrative record not created for purposes of this litigation—explicitly states \nthat the withheld funds are being “subject to review for alignment with Administration priorities.”  \nAR 60 (emphasis added).  Around that time, the Director of OMB urged the Senate to entirely \ndefund the Endowment because of its alleged support of media organizations critical of the \nPresident and his allies.  See Vought Letter at 3 (asserting that the Endowment’s grantees had \n“called for prosecutions of allies of the President” and “targeted and blacklisted” media outlets \nsupportive the president).  An affidavit from the Director of the Bureau of Budget Planning at the \nState Department highlights that the withholding decision was made “in consultation with OMB.”  \nAR 4.  Taken as a whole, that evidence leaves little doubt as to the defendants’ motivations—the \nEndowment’s work does not align with “Administration priorities.”  AR 60. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 8 of 15\nMoreover, the withholding of $95 million interferes with the statutory mandate that annual \nfunding must “enable the Endowment to carry out its purposes.”  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a).  The \nEndowment structures its initiatives and makes commitments to grantees in reliance on receiving \nthe full amount of appropriated funds, as it has every year for the past 42 years.  Wilson Supp. \nDecl. ¶¶ 40, 47.  It submitted a plan to Congress describing its “programmatic goals” for 2025 and \ndocumenting how “every appropriated dollar would be spent.”  Id. ¶ 47.  The sudden and \nunprecedented withholding of $95 million—or roughly 30%—from its anticipated budget has \nforced the Endowment to renege on commitments.  Id. ¶ 47.  It was unable to fund 226 approved \ngrants, 124 grants recommended for approval by the Board, and 53 core institute projects.  Id. \n¶¶ 49, 51.  These are activities that the Endowment, in consultation with Congress, has determined \nare “important and time-sensitive” to furthering “critical election monitoring, helping democracy \nactivists overcome authoritarian censorship, [and] maintain[ing] access to independent news and \ninformation,” id. ¶ 52—in other words, to fulfilling the Endowment’s mission.  The defendants \nhave fallen woefully short of providing an “annual grant” that “enable[s]” the Endowment to fulfill \nits statutory purposes.  See 22 U.S.C. § 4412(a). \nThe defendants’ official justification for that withholding—preserving the Endowment’s \nfunding stability for the coming year—is not plausible.  Opp’n at 13.  Before and during litigation, \nthe  defendants  obstructed  routine  drawdown  requests  on  money  already  set  aside  in  the \nEndowment’s Treasury account, imposed and then abandoned a novel waiver requirement, and \ndelayed the obligation of apportioned funds.  See Hr’g Rough Tr. at 42 (not disputing the plaintiff’s \nfactual allegations).  These actions vitiate any inference that the defendants’ concern has been to \n“ensure” the Endowment’s “level of funding in the coming fiscal year.”  AR 4.  Indeed, counsel \nfor the State Department provided that rationale to the Endowment for the first time in a June 11 \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 9 of 15\nemail, well after this litigation began.  See Am. Compl. Ex. A.  In light of the defendants’ repeated \nmaneuvers to impede the Endowment’s flow of funds, the Court does not find credible an \nexplanation offered in the shadow of pending litigation.  See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 785 (2019) (“[Courts] are not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are \nfree.” (citation modified)). \nNor does the Antideficiency Act authorize the defendants’ actions.  Section 1512(a) of the \nAct2 does permit OMB to set an apportionment schedule for no-year funds to ensure their efficient \nand orderly spending.  That provision directs that “[a]n appropriation for an indefinite period . . . \nshall be apportioned to achieve the most effective and economical use.”  31 U.S.C. § 1512(a).  But \nthe executive branch has long recognized that the apportionment authority under § 1512(a) does \nnot alter the substantive obligations imposed by other statutes on the expenditure of funds.  E.g., \nRed  Book  6-122  (noting  that  apportionment  does  not  “affect  the  operation  of  statutory \nrequirements concerning the availability or use of appropriated funds”); OMB Circular No. A-11 \nat § 120.9 (2024) (“[A]pportionment of funds is not a means for resolving any question dealing \nwith . . . the legality of using funds for the purpose for which they are apportioned.”); see also City \nof New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 906 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (noting Congress’s intent \nto  “preclude”  that  provision  from  being  invoked  “as  authority  for  implementing  ‘policy’ \nimpoundments”).  Thus, the defendants cannot rely on § 1512(a) to act in contravention of the \nNED Act.3 \n \n2 The parties agree that OMB was not acting under 31 U.S.C. § 1512(c) to create a funding reserve.  \nSee Opp’n at 12; Reply at 9, Dkt. 44. \n3 The Court is not aware of, and the defendants cannot point to, see Hr’g Rough Tr. at 43, any \nother circumstance under which § 1512(c) has been used to withhold such a substantial amount of \nfunds. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 10 of 15\nTo be clear, the Court does not reach whether “the Endowment must receive [its] full \nappropriated amount in [the same] fiscal year” in every case.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 29.  And it need \nnot decide whether the defendants are categorically prohibited from imposing an alternative \napportionment schedule in all instances.  The Court merely finds that the defendants may not \nwithhold appropriated funds under the present conditions: on the grounds that the Endowment’s \nprojects do not align with the Executive’s priorities. \n In sum, subjecting $95 million of the Endowment’s funding to “review for alignment with \nAdministration priorities,” AR 60, is precisely the kind of extra-statutory requirement prohibited \nby the NED Act, 22 U.S.C. § 4412(a).  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Endowment is \nlikely to succeed on its claim that the defendants violated the NED Act. \n2.  Arbitrary and Capriciousness \nThe Endowment also claims that withholding the appropriated funds is an arbitrary and \ncapricious agency action.  In an arbitrary and capriciousness challenge, the core question is \nwhether the agency’s decision was “the product of reasoned decisionmaking.”  Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 52 (1983).  An action is \narbitrary and capricious if the agency has “relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to \nconsider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for \nits decision that runs counter to the evidence before [it], or [the explanation] is so implausible that \nit could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Id. at 43.  An \nagency that fails to give an “indication of the basis” of its decision cannot withstand APA review.  \nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 167 (1962). \nThe defendants’ justification for its withholding is that reserving the funds “would achieve \nthe most effective and economical use of the [$95 million] because sufficient funds had already \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 11 of 15\nbeen disbursed to NED for [fiscal year] 2025”; and reservation “ensures that NED will retain at \nleast [$95 million in] funding in the coming fiscal year.”  AR 4.  Those assertions are neither \nreasoned nor rational. \nAs noted, the Endowment planned its 2025 grantmaking activities in expectation of \nreceiving the full amount of its annual appropriations, as it has for over four decades.  It committed \nevery dollar of expected appropriations to operational expenses, core institutes, and grantees; and \nit submitted the details of its spending plan to the congressional appropriations committees.  \nWilson Supp. Decl. ¶ 47.  The defendants fail to explain how funds falling 30% short of the \nEndowment’s anticipated budget could be “sufficient” to meet its operational needs, AR 4, or \n“enable” it “to carry out its purposes,” see 22 U.S.C. § 4412(a).  They do not address why it is “the \nmost efficient and economical” result, 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a), for the Endowment to default on \ncurrent financial obligations to grantees.  Wilson TRO Decl. ¶ 40.  Nor does the record show that \nthe defendants weighed, assessed, or displayed any awareness of the Endowment’s reliance \ninterests on the historical practice of routinely disbursing annual appropriations in full.  See FCC \nv. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  And finally, even if the defendants’ \nconcerns with ensuring the Endowment’s “level of funding in the coming fiscal year” were well-\nfounded,4 AR 4, “an agency may not rely on political guesswork about future congressional \nappropriations as a basis for violating existing legal mandates,” In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, \n260 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.). \n \n4 The House Appropriations Committee has recommended $315 million in appropriations for the \nEndowment in fiscal year 2026, in “recogni[tion of] the essential role of the [Endowment] in \npromoting key national security interests by countering threats from dangerous adversaries around \nthe world.”  H.R. Rep. No. 119-217 at 29–30 (2025). \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 12 of 15\nBecause the defendants’ “conclusory and unreasoned” assertions, Env’t Health Tr. v. FCC, \n9 F.4th 893, 905 (D.C. Cir. 2021), are entirely insufficient to justify their actions, the Endowment \nis also likely to succeed on its claim that withholding the $95 million in appropriated funds was \narbitrary and capricious.5 \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nTo establish irreparable harm, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the harm is (1) “certain and \ngreat, actual and not theoretical, and so imminent that there is a clear and present need for equitable \nrelief,”  and  (2)  “beyond  remediation.”  Newby,  838  F.3d  at  7–8  (citation  modified).    The \nEndowment has done so here. \nThe Endowment has lost access to over 30% of its anticipated budget for this fiscal year.  \nBecause it plans projects “based on the premise that [it] will have reliable access to all of the funds \nthat Congress appropriated for . . . this fiscal year,” the abrupt withholding of funding has forced \nthe Endowment to terminate critical staff and suspend impactful democracy-supporting initiatives.  \nWilson Supp. Decl. ¶ 47.  The Endowment has been forced to lay off 100 staff members— \napproximately 35% of its core workforce—and the uncertainty of future funding is accelerating \nattrition rates among key personnel.  Id. ¶¶ 33, 39, 41.  These individuals possess specialized \nskillsets, including language proficiencies, regional knowledge, and technical and cybersecurity \nexpertise.  Id. ¶ 41.  The loss of key personnel has hampered the Endowment’s ability to \n“facilitate[e] secure communication, support[] program monitoring and evaluation, and navigat[e] \ncomplex political and cultural landscapes—particularly in restrictive environments such as Iran, \nChina, Venezuela, Russia, and North Korea.”  Id. ¶ 37.  These harms are not merely monetary, \n \n5 Having concluded that the Endowment is likely to succeed on the merits of its APA claims on \ntwo alternative grounds, the Court will not address the constitutional claims. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 13 of 15\ncontra Opp’n at 21–24—they “unquestionably make it more difficult for the [Endowment] to \naccomplish [its] primary mission” of supporting democracy-promoting initiatives around the \nglobe.  Newby, 838 F.3d at 9; see AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. Dep’t of State, 766 F. Supp. 3d \n74, 81 (D.D.C. 2025) (finding irreparable harm from significant cuts to staff and reduction in core \noperations).   \nAdditionally, as a result of the current withholding, the Endowment is unable to provide \nfull funding to “more than 500 direct grants and approximately 53 core [institute] projects.”  Id. \n¶¶ 36, 48, 52 (“These projects . . . support important and time-sensitive activities including critical \nelection monitoring, helping democracy activists overcome authoritarian censorship, maintain \naccess to independent news and information across many media environments, and advance \nreforms to level the playing field for American businesses and protect labor rights.”).  The \nEndowment has been “forced to scale back support, both in terms of duration and amount, for \npriority projects including in countries such as Cuba and China, delay consideration of others, as \nwell as simply pass on a wide range of initiatives that require longer term investment.”  Id. ¶ 47.  \nThis drawback poses “special risks to grantee partners operating in authoritarian contexts, as the \nsudden  interruption  in  support  may  expose”  their  affiliation  with  the  Endowment,  inviting \n“reprisals from authoritarian governments.”  Id. ¶ 57.  Reneging on commitments destroys the \nEndowment’s credibility and “harms the Endowment’s mission and reputation as a trusted, reliable \nU.S. partner.”  Id. ¶ 96 (“Groups around the world, particularly in the most dangerous and difficult \nenvironments, seek out [the Endowment] due to our well-established reputation for reliability, \ntransparency,  consistency,  security-consciousness,  and  partnership.”).    These  harms  to  the \nEndowment’s global reputation and to the “very existence of its programs” are irreparable.  S. \nEduc. Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-cv-1079 (PLF), 2025 WL 1453047, at *15 (D.D.C. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 14 of 15\nMay 21, 2025); see Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 119 (D.D.C. 2025) \n(irreparable harm where grant terminations harmed organizations’ reputation as “reliable and \ntrustworthy partners and investors” (citation modified)). \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the Endowment has shown that it will suffer irreparable \nharm absent an injunction. \nC.  Balance of Harms and Public Interest \nThe two remaining factors—the balance of the equities and the public interest—“merge \nwhen the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  These \nfactors also weigh in the Endowment’s favor.  The defendants cannot show that they will be \nharmed by an injunction—it will not “disrupt” the defendants’ “oversight” of “taxpayer money” \nbecause they are not authorized exercise such oversight.  Contra Opp’n at 33.  As explained, the \ndefendants’ present withholding of appropriated funds on policy grounds violates the NED Act \nand appropriations laws.  The government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends \nan unlawful practice.”  See R.I.L.-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (citation \nmodified).  To the contrary, the “public interest is served when administrative agencies comply \nwith their obligations under the APA.”  Northern Mariana Islands v. United States, 686 F. Supp. \n2d 7, 21 (D.D.C. 2009).  In contrast, as explained, the Endowment will suffer significant harm \nfrom funding cuts that impede its ability to retain essential personnel and fulfill its obligations to \ngrantees.   \nAccordingly, the balance of equities and the public interest also weigh in the Endowment’s \nfavor. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 46     Filed 08/11/25     Page 15 of 15\nD.  Bond \nThe Court will not order the Endowment to post an injunction bond.  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(c) vests “broad discretion in the district court to determine the appropriate amount \nof an injunction bond,” DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), including the \n“discretion to require no bond at all,” P.J.E.S. ex rel. Escobar Francisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. 3d \n492, 520 (D.D.C. 2020) (citation modified); see Fed. League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Exec. \nOff. of the President, No. 25-cv-0946 (CKK), 2025 WL 1187730, at *62 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025) \n(collecting cases).  The defendants have likely unlawfully frozen the Endowment’s funding.  It \nmakes little sense to exacerbate the financial strain by requiring the Endowment to post bond. \nE.  Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal. \nThe Court will deny the defendants’ request for an administrative stay and a stay pending \nappeal.  For the reasons explained, the Endowment is likely to succeed on the merits of its APA \nclaims, and the defendants will not be irreparably harmed by the entry of an injunction. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction. The defendants are enjoined from withholding or otherwise interfering with the \nremaining fiscal year 2025 funds appropriated to the Endowment.  A separate order consistent with \nthis decision accompanies this memorandum opinion. \n \n \n                ________________________ \n                DABNEY L.

Humphrey Building \n200 Independence Avenue SW \nWashington, DC 20201; \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT \n1. This case concerns the Executive Branch’s unlawful impoundment of funds that\nCongress appropriated for the National Endowment for Democracy (the “Endowment” or \n“NED”).  In the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983 (the “NED Act”), Congress \nformally recognized the establishment of the Endowment as a private nonprofit corporation \nwhose mission is to “encourage free and democratic institutions throughout the world through \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 3 of 34\nprivate sector initiatives.”  22 U.S.C. § 4411.  To further that objective, and as specified in the \nAct, the Endowment awards grants to four core institutes that work to strengthen the institutions \nof democracy, and to a range of nonprofit organizations around the world committed to \nadvancing freedom in their own countries.  In the NED Act, Congress directed that the \nEndowment would be funded by annual congressional appropriations to support its \ncongressionally sanctioned mission and grantmaking activities.  Specifically, Congress directed \nthat the Endowment “shall” receive annual grants through the Department of State.  22 U.S.C. \n§ 4412(a).  Every year, Congress appropriates funding for the Endowment and directs that the \nfull amount of those funds shall be available to the Endowment until spent.  It has used the same \nmandatory language in every appropriations statute relevant here and in every one in recent \nmemory.  And every year, the Department of State has ensured that those funds have been timely \ntransferred to the Endowment—until now. \n2.  To ensure the Endowment can fulfill its statutory mandate, Congress appropriates \nfunds directly to the Endowment through an annual congressional appropriation under Title I of \nthe Department of State Foreign Operations and Related Programs (“SFOPS”) appropriations \nlegislation.  After Congress appropriates the Endowment’s funds, and OMB apportions them to \nthe Department of State, the Department of State is required by statute to issue a grant in the full \namount to the Endowment, thereby “obligating” the funds to be paid by the Executive Branch. \n3.  As prescribed by federal regulations, the Endowment does not receive the \nappropriation as a single lump sum, but instead is required to withdraw money only on an as-\nneeded basis.  The appropriated funds are held in an account at the Department of Treasury, and \nthe Endowment usually makes twice weekly withdrawals in order to pay its grantees pursuant to \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 4 of 34\ntheir grant agreements, pay its staff, and cover operating expenses.  As a result, the Endowment \ndoes not and cannot by law maintain significant cash reserves to fund its operations. \n4.  For the last month, the Executive Branch has denied the Endowment access to its \ncongressionally appropriated funds—something that has never occurred before in the \nEndowment’s forty-two-year existence.  That refusal has taken two forms.  First, the Executive \nhas withheld payment of routine drawdown requests necessary to fund the Endowment’s \noperations from the $167 million of funds already appropriated by Congress and obligated by the \nDepartment of State.  Second, the Department of State has refused to obligate the balance of the \nEndowment’s annual appropriation, totaling approximately $72 million.  No Executive Branch \nofficial has provided any explanation for those unprecedented actions.  But whatever the \npurported reason, the Executive Branch lacks statutory authority or discretion to deny the \nEndowment its congressionally appropriated funds in this manner. \n5.  As a result of the Executive’s unlawful impoundment of the funds that Congress \nappropriated for the Endowment, the Endowment is experiencing a devastating cash flow crisis \nthat jeopardizes its ability to fulfill its mission and its very existence, as well as that of its core \ninstitutes and grantees. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, and 1361. \n7.  Venue is proper in this district because a substantial part of the acts or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred in this judicial district.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 5 of 34\nPARTIES \n8.

For more than forty years, the Endowment has provided funding \nto organizations working to promote democratic governance, human rights, and political \nfreedoms worldwide in some of the most challenging environments—including authoritarian \nregimes and areas in which non-state actors such as drug cartels and terrorist organizations \nsuppress fundamental political freedoms.  The Endowment does not directly undertake any work \nin the United States.  \n20.  The Endowment traces its origins to President Ronald Reagan’s 1982 \nWestminster Address, delivered before the British Parliament in the midst of the Cold War.  \nPresident Reagan called for a new initiative to “foster the infrastructure of democracy” around \nthe world and announced that the United States would employ a bipartisan organization to \nsupport the “global campaign for democracy now gathering force.”1 \n21.  President Reagan’s leadership, together with that of the United States Congress, \nresulted in the formation of the Endowment as a private nonprofit organization, led by an \nindependent self-appointing Board of Directors, to be funded by Congress.  In 1983 and on an \n \n1 Adress to Members of the British Parliament, Palace of Westminster, London, England (June 8, \n1982), https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-members-british-parliament. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 7 of 34\noverwhelming and bipartisan basis, Congress passed the National Endowment for Democracy \nAct (the “NED Act”), which formally recognized the establishment of the Endowment as a \nprivate foundation authorized to receive federal funding through congressional appropriation.  \nSee 22 U.S.C. § 4411 et seq. \n22.  In the NED Act, Congress set forth several statutory purposes that the \nEndowment is to pursue.  The Endowment’s mandate is to “encourage free and democratic \ninstitutions throughout the world through private sector initiatives, including activities which \npromote the individual rights and freedoms (including internationally recognized human rights) \nwhich are essential to the functioning of democratic institutions.”  22 U.S.C. § 4411(b).  The \nEndowment is also devoted to promoting “democratic training programs and democratic \ninstitution-building abroad,” “strengthen[ing] democratic electoral processes abroad,”  and \n“encourag[ing] the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent \nboth with the broad concerns of United States national interests and with the specific \nrequirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by programs funded by \n[the Endowment].”  Id.  \n23.  The Endowment serves its mission of promoting freedom and democracy \nworldwide principally by operating as a grantmaking institution.  The Endowment funds four \n“core institutes” to fulfill the NED Act’s mandate of promoting exchanges between democratic \ngroups abroad and private sector initiatives, including “the two major American political parties, \nlabor, and business.”  See 22 U.S.C. § 4412(b)(2).  The Endowment’s core institutes are the \nNational Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, the Center for International \nPrivate Enterprise, and the Solidarity Center.  The Endowment directs around one third of its \ntotal appropriation to these core institutes, as required by the appropriation.  The core institutes \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 8 of 34\nensure that the Endowment’s programs represent the full breadth of American political life, with \nthe institutes associated with both of the major political parties, as well as labor and business. \n24.  In addition to funding the core institutes, the Endowment funds approximately \n1,700 individual projects active in over 100 countries.  Through this grant program, the \nEndowment discretionarily funds a network of frontline activists seeking to advance freedom in \ntheir own countries.  The Endowment’s grantees include organizations devoted to documenting \nhuman rights abuses and ensuring access to a free press, with an emphasis on the world’s most \nauthoritarian regimes.  Some of the Endowment’s grantees must keep their relationship to the \nEndowment discreet, given the sensitivity of their work in their home jurisdictions and the \npersonal risks the work entails.   \n25.  The Endowment regularly invests in grantees who work in repressive or conflict-\ntorn countries to foster peaceful efforts toward democracy.  In more open societies, the \nEndowment supports citizen groups working to strengthen democratic institutions and processes.  \nThe Endowment’s record speaks for itself:  Many of the nations in which the Endowment and its \ncore institutes have strategically invested over the years ultimately made the transition to \ndemocracy, including Chile, South Africa, Taiwan, the Philippines, Mongolia, Ghana, countries \nin Central and Eastern Europe, and others.  In that way, the Endowment is engaged in the critical \nlong-haul work of pursuing a more democratic, stable, and prosperous world—a goal that the \nEndowment’s founders and members of both parties have long recognized as furthering United \nStates economic and security interests. \n26.  The Endowment’s unique structure allows it to function on an extremely cost-\neffective basis, ensuring that the vast majority of its appropriated funds go directly to grantees’ \ndemocracy-supporting work.  Eighty-three percent of the Endowment’s funding goes directly to \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 9 of 34\ngrantees.  Importantly, grantees do not receive those funds upfront.  Funding for all grantees is \ntied to submission of scheduled progress reports and other deliverables.  Even the core institutes \nmust request payment drawdowns against their cash needs as they go.   \n27.  The Endowment’s spending and operations are subject to rigorous financial \ncontrols and reporting requirements.  Pursuant to the NED Act, the Endowment conducts annual \naudits of its accounts, the results of which it provides to Congress as part of its annual report.  22 \nU.S.C. § 4413(e), (h).  The Endowment’s financial transactions are also subject to government \naudit, the reports of which must also be reported to Congress.  22 U.S.C. § 4413(f), (g).  And the \nEndowment’s bipartisan, experienced Board of Directors provides robust oversight of the \nEndowment’s financials, ensuring that its funds are used only for grants and activities consistent \nwith its statutory mandate.  More specifically, the Budget, Audit, and Administration Committee \nof the Board of Directors manages the Endowment’s audit process, financial reporting, and \ncompliance functions. \n28.  The Endowment’s mission of advancing the cause of liberty and democracy \naround the world is nonpartisan, and the Endowment is bipartisan by design.  The Endowment’s \nself-appointed Board of Directors is bipartisan; it includes two members from the House and two \nhonorary members from the Senate, with a Republican and a Democrat from each chamber.  The \nEndowment funds both the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican \nInstitute.  As President Reagan explained, “One of the strengths of this organization is that it is \nconstructed on a bipartisan basis.”2   \n \n2 Ronald Reagan, Message to the Congress Transmitting the Annual Report of the National \nEndowment for Democracy (Feb. 19, 1986), https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/\nmessage-congress-transmitting-annual-report-national-endowment-democracy. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 10 of 34\n29.  The private, nongovernmental nature of the Endowment’s work is also essential to \nits structure and purpose.  The Endowment’s mandate is to support private American groups \nforging relationships with and supporting private groups abroad in pursuit of democratic goals \naround the world. \n30.  In the forty-two years since its founding, leaders from across the political \nspectrum have hailed the Endowment’s work.  Shortly after its founding, President Reagan \nproclaimed that the “establishment of the National Endowment goes right to the heart of \nAmerica’s faith in democratic ideals and institutions.  It offers hope to people everywhere.”3   \n31.  President Jimmy Carter praised the Endowment and core institutes’ work \noverseeing the balloting for Indonesia’s first free election in more than 40 years.  President \nCarter explained that “[t]he creation of the NED in the 1980s reflected a bipartisan belief that the \npromotion of freedom is an enduring American interest and that nongovernmental \nrepresentatives would best be able to help their counterparts build democracy in other \ncountries.”4  \n32.  President Bill Clinton has commended the Endowment as “one of our most \neffective means for supporting grass-roots trade union, business and citizen groups, which form \nthe basis for democratic reform.”  As President Clinton explained, “[b]y fostering such reforms \n \n3 President Ronald Reagan’s Remarks at a White House Ceremony Inaugurating the National \nEndowment for Democracy (December 16, 1983), https://www.ned.org/president-ronald-\nreagans-remarks-at-a-white-house-ceremony-inaugurating-the-national-endowment-for-\ndemocracy/. \n4 Jimmy Carter and Paul Wolfowitz, Don’t Take Democracy for Granted (July 20, 1999), \nhttps://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1389.html. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 11 of 34\nabroad, we not only project our own values, we also increase our own security and create better \npartners for trade and global problem solving.”5 \n33.  President George W. Bush praised “the bipartisan spirit” of the Endowment, \ndescribing the Endowment’s work “promoting women’s rights, and training Iraqi journalists, and \nteaching the skills of political participation.”6  And President George H.W. Bush before him \nrecognized that the Endowment’s “work is giving expression to the oldest and noblest tradition \nof this country—the devotion to freedom for all humanity.”7 \n34.  In 2017, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, formerly a board member of the \nEndowment-funded International Republican Institute, celebrated the Endowment’s grantees, \napplauding their “courage” and “drive to combat corruption, press for transparency and \naccountability and advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world.”  Secretary \nRubio thanked the Endowment for its work to “advance the cause of freedom and carry out the \nvision President Reagan articulated those many years ago.”8   \nB.  The Endowment Is Funded By Direct Congressional Appropriation \n35.  From its inception, the Endowment was structured to ensure continuity of funding \nand independence.  Unlike other nongovernmental organizations, which receive funds at the \ndiscretion of federal agencies, the Endowment is funded through annual appropriations directly \nfrom Congress.   \n \n5 140 Cong.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) on NED’s 2017 Democracy Awardees, National Endowment for \nDemocracy (posted June 7, 2017), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPihC7UQ9jk&t=15s.  \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 12 of 34\n36.  In the NED Act, Congress directed the Department of State to convey the \nEndowment’s annual appropriation to it.  The NED Act provides that the Department of State \n“shall make an annual grant to the Endowment to enable the Endowment to carry out its \npurposes as specified in section 4411(b) of this title.”  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a) (emphasis added).9  \nSection 4412 thus leaves the Department of State with no discretion:  It must make an annual \ngrant to the Endowment each year.   \n37.  To enable that annual grant, Congress appropriates funds each year for the \nEndowment’s use.  It has done so every year since the Endowment’s founding.  For fiscal year \n2024, for instance, Congress provided in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act:  “For \ngrants made by the Department of State to the National Endowment for Democracy, as \nauthorized by the National Endowment for Democracy Act (22 U.S.C. 4412), $315,000,000, to \nremain available until expended, of which $210,316,000 shall be allocated in the traditional and \ncustomary manner, including for the core institutes, and $104,684,000 shall be for democracy \nprograms.”  Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 737 (2024).  Although the amount of the \nappropriation has varied from year to year, the basic statutory command has not.  Congress has \nconsistently directed that the full appropriated amount “shall be allocated” to the Endowment: a \nportion is earmarked for the Endowment’s core institutes from the funds that “shall be allocated \nin the traditional and customary manner,” and another portion “shall be for” the Endowment’s \ndemocracy programs.  In addition, the appropriated amount is to “remain available” to the \n \n9 As adopted, the NED Act identified the United States Information Agency, which was \nconsolidated with the Department of State in 1999 pursuant to the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998.  See Federal Register, United States Information Agency, \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/united-states-information-agency. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 13 of 34\nEndowment “until expended.”  The Department of State thus has no discretion to make less than \nthe full appropriated amount available to the Endowment. \n38.  The Endowment’s appropriation appears in Title I of the Department of State \nForeign Operations and Related Programs (“SFOPS”) appropriations legislation.  Title I of the \nappropriations legislation is directed to Department of State operations and diplomatic programs, \nas well as certain “foreign affairs-focused nongovernmental organizations,” including the \nEndowment.10  By contrast, appropriations for United States foreign assistance, including \nappropriations for discretionary foreign-assistance grants, appear in other titles of the \nappropriations legislation, including Titles III and IV.11 \n39.  The Title I appropriations described above make up approximately 95% of the \nEndowment’s funding.  The Endowment also receives certain foreign-assistance funding under \nTitle III, comprising approximately 5% of its funding.  That latter amount is not at issue here.  \n40.  Once the congressional appropriation is enacted and signed into law, OMB is \nresponsible for apportioning the Endowment’s appropriated funds to the Department of State, to \nbe granted to the Endowment.  See 31 U.S.C. § 1513(b).12   \n41.  The Department of State has the administrative obligation to transfer the funding \nto the Endowment.

See Notice; Delegation of Apportionment Authority, 90 Fed. \nReg. 9737 (Feb. 18, 2025), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/18/2025-\n02720/notice-delegation-of-apportionment-authority. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 14 of 34\nappropriation award together with the Office of Acquisitions Management, located within the \nDepartment of State’s Bureau for Administration, which serves as DRL’s grants office.   \n42.  Pursuant to the NED Act, the Department of State (acting through DRL and the \nOffice of Acquisitions Management) issues the award to the Endowment for the appropriated \namount, thereby “obligating” the funds to be paid to the Endowment by the Executive Branch.  \nAs required by the NED Act, the Department of State uses a grant agreement to structure the \ntransfer.  The NED Act sets out the terms for this process:  \nSuch grants shall be made pursuant to a grant agreement between the Director and the \nEndowment which requires that grant funds will only be used for activities which the Board \nof Directors of the Endowment determines are consistent with the purposes described in \nsection 4411(b) of this title, that the Endowment will allocate funds in accordance with \nsubsection (e) of this section, and that the Endowment will otherwise comply with the \nrequirements of this subchapter.  The grant agreement may not require the Endowment \nto comply with requirements other than those specified in this subchapter. \n \n22 U.S.C. § 4412(a) (emphases added).   \nThus, the Department of State has no statutory authority to impose additional conditions on the \nEndowment’s use of the appropriated funds beyond those already set forth by Congress in the \nNED Act.   \n43.  After the Department of State obligates the appropriated funds to the Endowment, \ncertain other agencies are involved in the mechanical process of transferring the funds to the \nEndowment.   \n44.  The annual appropriation award obligated to the Endowment is set aside for the \nEndowment in an account held at the Department of Treasury.  The Endowment cannot obtain \nthe balance of its appropriated funds all at once.  Federal regulations provide that the Endowment \nmay access its appropriated funds only by regularly requesting drawdowns from its Treasury \naccount on an as-needed basis as it incurs expenses.  See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.305, 600.101(a) \n  14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 15 of 34\n(“payment methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the \nFederal Agency . . . and the disbursement of funds by the recipient”).  Those expenses include \nthe Endowment’s operational spending, the core institutes’ appropriated spending, and payments \nto discretionary grantees.   \n45.  As a result of this payment structure, the Endowment effectively operates \npayment-to-payment and cannot maintain a significant cash reserve.  To ensure that it can fund \nits own operations, as well as the operations of the core institutes and grantees, the Endowment \ntypically submits two drawdown requests every week.   \n46.  Though it is the Department of State that administers the Endowment’s \nappropriated funds, and the Department of Treasury that holds its funds and disburses payments, \nthe Endowment’s drawdown requests are processed through a system called Payment \nManagement Services (“PMS”), administered by HHS’s Program Support Center.  The PMS \nportal is a shared system for processing grant payments used by various agencies across the \nfederal government.   \n47.  Typically, DRL approves the Endowment’s drawdown requests through the PMS \nportal in less than 48 hours.  After that, the Endowment’s appropriated funds are transferred from \nits account at the Department of Treasury to the Endowment’s bank account, usually within 24 \nhours.  No statute gives any agency involved in ensuring that the Endowment receives its \ncongressionally appropriated and Department of State-obligated funding any discretion to \nwithhold timely delivery of that funding or to second guess the decision to award it.   \nC.  The Executive Branch Has Denied the Endowment Access to Obligated, \nCongressionally Appropriated Funds \n48.  For over a month, the Endowment has been locked out of its approximately $167 \nmillion cash balance of obligated, appropriated funds held in its Treasury account.  In the first \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 16 of 34\nfiscal year 2025 Continuing Resolution (Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 \n(Sept. 24, 2024)), Congress appropriated additional funds to the Endowment based on its fiscal \nyear 2024 appropriation, amounting to $69,898,500.  Around January 15, 2025, the Department \nof State obligated the $69,898,500 in appropriated funds to the Endowment for payment by the \nExecutive Branch.  The $167 million cash balance in the Endowment’s Treasury account \nincludes that amount, as well as other available, already-obligated funds from prior years’ annual \nappropriation awards.  These funds are referred to here as “tranche 1” funds.  Ordinarily, the full \n$167 million would be available to the Endowment to draw down at its discretion, consistent \nwith 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.305, 600.101(a), to pay its operational expenses and fulfill its payment \nobligations to grantees. \n49.  On January 21, 2025, the Endowment requested from PMS a drawdown totaling \n$36,663,100 from its appropriated funds to pay for its operational expenses and grants.  DRL \nultimately approved that request, but only after receiving confirmation that the funds requested \nwere congressionally appropriated Title I funds, and that they were therefore not subject to a \nJanuary 20, 2025 Executive Order titled “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign \nAid.”  Exec. Order No. 14169, 90 F.R. 8619 (2025).  That Executive Order paused certain \nforeign assistance—but, as the Department of State itself has explained, only those funds \nappropriated under Title III and Title IV of SFOPS and to “International Organizations and \nPrograms” under Title V.  The Endowment’s Title I funds thus were not (and could not be) \nsubject to the Executive Order.  After the Endowment explained to DRL staff that its payment \nrequest concerned congressionally appropriated Title I funds not subject to the Executive Order, \nDRL approved the Endowment’s request.   \n  16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 17 of 34\n50.  January 22, 2025 was the last time that the Endowment was able to withdraw its \nappropriated, obligated funds.  Until the Executive Branch began refusing to disburse the \nEndowment’s funds, the Endowment’s activities were continuing in the ordinary course.   \n51.  On January 28 and January 30, 2025 the Endowment submitted drawdown \nrequests totaling approximately $97 million of its obligated, congressionally appropriated funds.  \nThe Endowment made the request to cover grantee expense reimbursements and advance \npayments, the Endowment’s own operational expenses, and payments for new core institute \nprojects and discretionary grantees that recently had been approved by the Endowment’s Board \nat its regular January meeting. \n52.  With its PMS requests still pending on January 31, 2025, the Endowment reached \nout to DRL for a status update.  In the Endowment’s experience, a multi-day delay is highly \nunusual.  In the ordinary course, if the Endowment requests funds before 1:00 p.m., it receives \nthem the next business day; requests made after 1:00 p.m. are received on the second business \nday.  That promptness is necessitated by federal regulations that require payment methods to \n“minimize” the time between the transfer of funds from the government and the disbursement by \nthe recipient.  2 C.F.R. §§ 200.305(b), 600.101(a).  \n53.  DRL staff responded that they were “working on it,” and by 3:00 p.m. that \nafternoon, the Endowment’s finance team saw that the requests were “approved” in the PMS \nsystem. \n54.  Since January 31, however, those “approved” payment requests have been marked \nin PMS with a status that the Endowment has never before seen: “in transit.” \n55.  A month later, the funds still have not been released to the Endowment’s bank \naccount and remain inaccessible. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 18 of 34\n56.  On February 6, 2025, the White House issued a memorandum to the heads of \nexecutive departments and agencies directing them to “review all funding that agencies provide \nto [nongovernmental organizations (“NGOs”)] . . . on the basis of applicable authorizing statutes, \nregulations, and terms.”13  The Department of State has not asserted that it is relying on that \nmemorandum as justification for refusing to make available the Endowment’s appropriated Title \nI funds.  The memorandum does not purport to freeze or discontinue funds pending executive \nreview, and it therefore does not and cannot provide authority to deny the Endowment its \nfunding.  In all events, an Executive Branch memorandum cannot provide authority to freeze or \ndiscontinue the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funding. \n57.  On February 11, the Endowment wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \nrequesting the release of its appropriated funds, payment of which the Department of State had \napproved on January 31.  The letter reiterated that the funds in question are Title I funds and, \ntherefore, not subject to the January 20 Executive Order on foreign aid. \n58.  The next day, the Endowment’s grant officer representative at DRL emailed to \nask whether the Endowment had any outstanding payment requests in PMS.  She requested \nspecific information, including screenshots, for each PMS request and advised the Endowment \nthat “submissions are subject to further review within the Department of State that may require \nadditional processing for approval.” \n59.  The Endowment promptly responded with the requested information and to \nindicate that it was awaiting $97,581,876 in funding from PMS.  The Endowment included in its \n \n13 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (Feb. 6, 2025), available \nat, https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-\nexecutive-departments-and-agencies/.  The memorandum currently is not available in either the \nWeekly or Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents. \n  18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 19 of 34\nresponse a screenshot of the PMS system, which showed three pending requests, all marked as \n“approved.” \n60.  More than a week later, on February 20, DRL invited the Endowment to submit \nan “Obligation or Disbursement under Waiver of Foreign Assistance Pause” form for its pending \nPMS requests, on the condition that the requests were for costs incurred prior to January 24, \n2025.  As noted, the administration’s January 24, 2025 foreign aid freeze, in place pursuant to \nthe January 20 Executive Order described above, does not apply to the Endowment’s \nappropriated Title I funds.  But regardless, the Executive Branch lacks authority under the NED \nAct and annual appropriations legislation to “freeze” or otherwise withhold the Endowment’s \nobligated, congressionally appropriated funds.   \n61.  On February 26, 2025, OMB issued a memorandum calling for data on foreign \nassistance funding.  See Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, OMB \nMemorandum M-25-08, Agency Foreign Assistance Review (FAR) Data Call 1.  The \nmemorandum directs that agencies by March 17, 2025 “review their foreign assistance \nprograms” and “make a recommendation on whether to continue, modify, or cease each foreign \nassistance program.”  Id. at 2.  Based on that data, the “responsible Department and Agency \nheads, in consultation with the Director of OMB,” and “with [the] concurrence of the Secretary \nof State,” “will make recommendations” “to the President for final determinations.”  Id. at 2–3.  \nThe memorandum defines foreign assistance as including “any activity funded under Title 22 of \nthe United States Code.”  Id.  The Department of State has not asserted that it is relying on this \nmemorandum as justification for withholding the Endowment’s appropriated Title I funds.  The \nmemorandum does not purport to freeze or discontinue funds pending executive review, and it \ntherefore does not and cannot provide authority to deny the Endowment its funding.  In all \n  19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 20 of 34\nevents, an Executive Branch memorandum cannot provide authority to freeze or discontinue the \nEndowment’s congressionally appropriated funding.   \n62.  Defendants’ withholding of the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated, \nobligated funds is unprecedented. \n63.  Defendants have thus unreasonably and unlawfully impounded the Endowment’s \ncongressionally appropriated funds. \nD.  The Executive Branch Has Refused to Obligate to the Endowment Its Annual \nAppropriation \n64.  On top of denying payment on the Endowment’s approved drawdown requests for \nalready-obligated funding, the Department of State has failed to obligate to the Endowment its \nsecond fiscal year 2025 Continuing Resolution obligation of approximately $72 million.  See \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 118-83, § 101, 138 Stat. 1524, \n1524–1525 (2024); American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 118-158, 138 Stat. 1722 (2024).14 \n65.  On January 16, 2025, DRL informed the Endowment that it had “received the \nsecond tranche of NED’s FY 2025 funding in the amount of $72,481,500.”  DRL, through the \nOffice of Acquisitions Management, accordingly prepared to obligate the Endowment its \nappropriated funds through an amendment to the current fiscal year 2025 annual appropriation \ngrant agreement. \n66.  The Endowment has been told by DRL that the amendment obligating the \nEndowment’s appropriated funds is complete and ready to be issued. \n67.  Yet for over a month State has refused to obligate, as required by statute, the \nsecond tranche of the Endowment’s fiscal year 2025 Title I annual appropriation funding. \n \n14 These funds can be referred to as “tranche 2” funds, and, like tranche 1, they are entirely Title \nI funds. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 21 of 34\nOn February 20, 2025, an Office of Acquisitions Management grants officer told the Endowment \nthat he was waiting to “get guidance regarding NED Core Project funding and approvals” and \nwould alert the Endowment as soon as he got a response.  He did not specify from whom he was \nawaiting guidance or what legal authority would allow the Department of State to do anything \nother than obligate the funds that Congress has appropriated to the Endowment.  The \nEndowment responded to again confirm that its core annual appropriation is Title I funding.   \n68.  The Executive Branch’s unilateral refusal to obligate the Endowment’s \nappropriated funds is unprecedented. \n69.  In addition to the January 20 Executive Order discussed above, the Executive \nBranch has issued additional executive orders and memoranda purporting to freeze various types \nof federal grants and spending.  The Executive Branch has not suggested that any of those \nmemoranda or orders provide authority to impound the Endowment’s funding.  For the reasons \nexplained above, the January 20 Executive Order does not apply to the Endowment’s funds.  \nAnd whatever the purported reason behind Defendants’ actions with respect to the Endowment’s \ncongressionally appropriated funds, the statutory scheme is clear:  The Executive Branch lacks \ndiscretion to override the Endowment’s statutorily mandated appropriations funds. \nE.  Harm to the Endowment \n70.  As a result of the Executive Branch’s impoundment of the Endowment’s \nappropriated funds, the Endowment is experiencing an unprecedented cash flow crisis that \njeopardizes its very existence and ability to fulfill its mission. \n71.  As of March 1, the Endowment furloughed 62% of its staff.  The Endowment has \nalso given notice that an additional 13% of its staff will be furloughed by March 15.  In total, \n75% of the Endowment’s staff will be furloughed—and the Endowment expects to take \nadditional staffing actions, including layoffs.  Already, 100% of the Endowment’s staff has been \n  21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 22 of 34\naffected by salary reductions or related personnel action, like part-time status.  Beyond the \nimmediate financial strain, these cuts have far-reaching consequences—undermining the \nEndowment’s ability to safeguard sensitive information, support democracy advocates, and \nmaintain grantee relationships in closed societies. \n72.  Given the nature of the Endowment’s work advancing freedom, it is a frequent \ntarget of cyber threats from hostile foreign adversaries.  With its staff furloughed or laid off, the \nEndowment is losing essential personnel responsible for protecting grantee data, preventing \ncyberattacks, and safeguarding the Endowment’s digital infrastructure.  Any breach risks \nexposing democratic activists and civil society organizations in authoritarian states, putting their \nsecurity, and potentially their lives, at risk. \n73.  The Endowment is also losing skills in critical areas, including language, regional \nexpertise, and technical fields.  These capabilities could take years to rebuild.  The Endowment \nhas spent years building a team that collectively speaks more than 45 languages, including Farsi, \nMandarin, Spanish, Arabic, Urdu, Khmer, Lingala, and Swahili, which is essential to the \nEndowment’s work around the globe, including in Iran, China, Venezuela, and Pakistan.  Losing \nthis expertise means losing access, understanding, and key relationships that have been \ndeveloped over decades. \n74.  Without the ability to draw down its appropriated funds, the Endowment does not \nhave cash on hand to fund the core institutes or discretionary grantees.  For the first time in its \ndecades-long history, the Endowment has failed to meet its financial obligations to the core \ninstitutes and grantees and, as a result, has been forced to suspend nearly 1,300 grant projects \nworldwide.  The suspension of all grants, if it continues, will have a profound reputational \n  22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 23 of 34\nimpact on the Endowment, threatening the Endowment’s future ability to cultivate partners and \nrelationships. \n75.  Because the Endowment does not administer any programs directly, its grantees \nare fundamental to its ability to effectively carry out its mandate, as provided by Congress.  \nHarm to grantees, whether through staff layoffs or disruption of their programs, directly \ncompromises the Endowment’s ability to fulfill its mandate under federal law.   \n76.  Grantees have already faced considerable hardship from the funding freeze, \nincluding: an inability to maintain broadcast and publication schedules, undermining their ability \nto retain audiences; an inability to meet tax, labor, and other local obligations; and an inability to \nimplement time-sensitive projects like election monitoring and get-out-the-vote campaigns.  The \nfreezing of the Endowment’s funds poses special risk to partners operating in highly \nauthoritarian contexts, as the sudden interruption in support may expose their operations and \nstaff as Endowment grantees, thereby inviting legal or other reprisal from authoritarian \ngovernments that oppose their work.   \n77.  The funding freeze—if it is allowed to continue—harms the Endowment not just \nnow, but far into the future as well.  Already, the Endowment has been forced to suspend its \nregularly scheduled grantmaking cycles for May and September 2025.  The freeze also has and \nwill continue to harm the Endowment’s reputation.  The Endowment engages partners based on \ntrust and mutual respect, and each partner enters into a grant agreement with the Endowment \nwith the expectation that the foundation will honor its financial and operational obligations.  The \nEndowment’s reputation is critical to its ability to engage productively with partners worldwide \nand fulfill its mission.  And, given the harms experienced by grantees so far, many may simply \n  23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 24 of 34\nnot be around to continue their important work, even if the Endowment’s funding were to \neventually resume at a later date.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nAPA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Against All Defendants) \n78.  The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n79.  The APA provides that a court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law[,]” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity[,]” or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right[.]”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)–(C). \n80.  Defendants’ impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated \nfunding is final agency action reviewable under 5 U.S.C. § 704.  The denial of funding is \nreviewable “final agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  “Agency action” includes an agency’s \n“denial” of “recognition” to a “claim” or “right”; the “denial” of a “grant of money”; and the \n“failure to act” or “withholding” with respect to claims, rights, and grants of money.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(10), (11), (13).  Defendants’ actions are “final” because they are the “functional \nequivalent” of an express denial of payment—the consequences of Defendants’ impoundment of \nthe Endowment’s funds are identical to the consequences of an express statement of denial.  See \nLewis v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 743 F. Supp. 3d 181, 192 (D.D.C. 2024). \n  24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 25 of 34\n81.  Defendants’ actions are contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority \nbecause the statutory scheme creates a mandatory, non-discretionary duty for Defendants to \nmake available, obligate, and disburse the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds.  22 \nU.S.C. § 4412(a); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47 (2024); 31 \nU.S.C. § 3325. \n82.  Defendants’ actions are also contrary to the United States Constitution because \nthey violate the Separation of Powers, as well as the Take Care Clause, the Appropriations \nClause, the Spending Clause, and the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. \n83.  Even if characterized as a suspension pending review pursuant to the Executive’s \nvarious ongoing spending reviews, Defendants’ actions have had the effect of denying the \nEndowment access to its congressionally appropriated funds.  That denial is arbitrary and \ncapricious and contrary to law because Defendants have a mandatory, non-discretionary statutory \nduty to make available, obligate, and disburse the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated \nfunds; because Defendants’ actions lack any lawful basis; because Defendants have refused to \nprovide any explanation for their actions; and because Defendants’ actions threaten the \nEndowment’s continued existence in light of regulations preventing it from maintaining a \nsignificant cash reserve, in direct contravention of Congress’s expressed intention that the \nEndowment shall use its appropriated funds to fulfill its statutory mandate.   \n84.  This Court should hold unlawful and set aside Defendants’ unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 26 of 34\nCOUNT TWO \nAPA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n(Against All Defendants) \n85.

The APA provides that a reviewing court “shall” “compel agency action \nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n87.  The Department of the Treasury has a non-discretionary duty to disburse the \nfunds in its charge upon receipt of a properly executed voucher.  31 U.S.C. § 3325.  When HHS \nexercises delegated authority to disburse federal funds, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3321(a), 3322, it has the \nsame non-discretionary duty. \n88.  Neither Treasury nor HHS has complied with that mandatory duty as it relates to \nthe Endowment’s obligated funds located in its Treasury account and requested through the PMS \nsystem (that is, the tranche 1 funds). \n89.  The Department of State has a non-discretionary duty to make an annual grant to \nthe Endowment “to enable the Endowment to carry out its purposes.”  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a); see \nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47 (2024).  \n90.  The Department of State has not complied with that mandatory duty as it relates \nto the Endowment’s obligated funds located in its Treasury account and requested through the \nPMS system.  Neither has the Department of State complied with that mandatory duty as it \nrelates to the Endowment’s appropriated funds, which the Department of State received but has \nnot obligated despite preparing a grant-agreement amendment that is ready to go. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 27 of 34\n91.  Defendants’ actions are also contrary to the United States Constitution because \nthey violate the Separation of Powers, as well as the Take Care Clause, the Appropriations \nClause, the Spending Clause, and the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. \n92.  The Court should thus compel Defendants to disburse and otherwise make \naccessible the Endowment’s obligated funds and to obligate the remainder of the Endowment’s \nannual appropriation. \nCOUNT THREE \nMandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361; All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 \n(Against Defendants Department of State, OMB, Department of Treasury, HHS, Marco \nRubio, Russell Vought, Scott Bessent, Robert F.

Under the Presentment Clause, the President lacks authority to \nmodify or amend duly enacted Legislation—the President may only “approve all the parts of a \nBill, or reject it in toto.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 439–40 (1998) (citation \nomitted).  The President cannot delegate powers to other executive branch officials that violate \nthe Constitution. \n102.  Both the NED Act and the congressional appropriations laws mandating that \nfunds be provided to the Endowment, including for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, are duly enacted \nlegislation that leave no room for executive discretion. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648     Document 1     Filed 03/05/25     Page 29 of 34\n103.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally \nappropriated funds therefore amounts to an attempt to amend, modify, or partially veto duly \nenacted legislation in violation of the Presentment Clause.   \nCOUNT FIVE \nAppropriations Clause, U.S. Const. art.

This case concerns the Executive Branch’s unlawful impoundment of funds that \nCongress appropriated for the National Endowment for Democracy (the “Endowment” or \n“NED”).  In the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983 (the “NED Act”), Congress \n \n1 By email on June 25, 2025, counsel for Defendants consented in writing to the filing of this \nAmended Complaint.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 3 of 61\nformally recognized the establishment of the Endowment as a private, nonprofit corporation \nwhose mission is to “encourage free and democratic institutions throughout the world through \nprivate sector initiatives.”  22 U.S.C. § 4411.  To further that objective, and as specified in the \nAct, the Endowment awards grants to four core institutes that work to strengthen the institutions \nof democracy, and to a range of nonprofit organizations around the world committed to \nadvancing freedom in their own countries.  In the NED Act, Congress directed that the \nEndowment would be funded by annual congressional appropriations to support its \ncongressionally sanctioned mission and grantmaking activities.  Specifically, Congress directed \nthat the Endowment “shall” receive annual grants through the Department of State.  22 U.S.C. \n§ 4412(a).  Every year, Congress appropriates funding for the Endowment and directs that the \nfull amount of those funds shall be available to the Endowment until spent.  It has used the same \nmandatory language in every appropriations statute relevant here and in every one in recent \nmemory.  And every year, the Executive Branch has ensured that those funds have been timely \ntransferred to the Endowment—until now. \n2.  To ensure the Endowment can fulfill its statutory mandate, Congress appropriates \nfunds directly to the Endowment through an annual congressional appropriation under Title I of \nthe Department of State Foreign Operations and Related Programs (“SFOPS”) appropriations \nlegislation.  After Congress appropriates the Endowment’s funds, the Office of Management and \nBudget (“OMB”) and the Department of State are required by statute to transfer the money to the \nEndowment.  OMB must apportion the funds Congress appropriated to the Department of State, \nand then the Department of State must issue a grant in the full amount to the Endowment, \nthereby “obligating” the funds to be paid by the Executive Branch. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 4 of 61\n3.  For much of this calendar year, the Executive Branch has been intent on \nimpounding the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds.  From the earliest days of the \ncurrent administration, high-level officials and their affiliates were outspoken about their policy \nobjections to the Endowment’s work.  Since then, they have repeatedly tried to interfere with the \nEndowment’s ability to fulfill its congressionally sanctioned purpose. \n4.  For two months between January and March 2025, the Executive Branch denied \nthe Endowment access to its congressionally appropriated funds—something that had never \npreviously occurred in the Endowment’s forty-two-year existence.  That refusal took two forms.  \nFirst, the Executive withheld payment of routine drawdown requests necessary to fund the \nEndowment’s operations from the $167 million of funds that had already been appropriated by \nCongress and obligated by the Department of State.  Second, the Department of State refused to \nobligate the balance of the funds that Congress had appropriated to the Endowment at that point, \ntotaling approximately $72 million.  To this day, no Executive Branch official has provided any \nexplanation for those unprecedented actions.  But whatever the purported reason, the Executive \nBranch lacked statutory authority or discretion to deny the Endowment its congressionally \nappropriated funds in that manner. \n5.  That unlawful impoundment inflicted extreme and unprecedented hardship on the \nEndowment.  The organization was forced to announce furloughs for up to 70% of its staff and \neventually lay off 35% of its staff, and—for the first time ever—it defaulted on obligations to its \ngrantees.  With its ability to carry out its purpose in jeopardy, and with outreach to Defendants \nproviding no relief, the Endowment had no choice but to file this suit to restore its funding. \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 5 of 61\n6.  In response to the filing of this suit, Defendants temporarily ceased their unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds.  But that did not stop them from \nexploring other pathways to frustrate the Endowment’s mission. \n7.  Defendants have now settled on a new tool for unlawfully impounding the \nEndowment’s funds:  OMB’s role in apportionment.  Defendants are withholding approximately \n$95 million in funding that Congress has appropriated specifically for obligation to the \nEndowment in fiscal year 2025, but that OMB has not yet apportioned.  According to \nDefendants, they are “reserving” those funds for the future in light of a “review” of the \nEndowment’s funding “for alignment with Administration priorities.”  This action is \nunprecedented.  Never before in the Endowment’s forty-two-year history has OMB refused to \napportion, and thus the State Department failed to obligate, the full amount of funds that \nCongress appropriated specifically for obligation to the Endowment in the fiscal year in which \nthose funds were appropriated.  \n8.  If allowed to stand, that maneuver threatens to trigger a cash flow crisis and \nexacerbate the operational and programmatic harms that began earlier this year.  It also threatens \nimmediate harm to the Endowment’s ability to fulfill the mission that Congress expects it to \npursue.  The Endowment relies on consistent and predictable access to the funds that Congress \nappropriates for its use, including for purposes of making critical staffing decisions, approving \nsupport for its direct partners, and providing funds for projects of its core institutes.  The \nEndowment has traditionally made funding commitments based on the expectation that \nCongress’s spending decision will be followed.  The refusal to apportion tens of millions of \ndollars of the Endowment’s appropriated funds makes that impossible.   \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 6 of 61\n9.  The refusal to apportion the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds \nruns afoul of the NED Act, the appropriations acts, and the Anti-Deficiency Act and amounts to \nan unreasonable and unconstitutional impoundment.  If allowed to stand, Defendants’ actions \nwill set a dangerous new precedent—giving a green light to the Executive Branch to withhold \nappropriated funds based on bare policy disagreement with Congress’s spending decisions.  \nFederal law and the Constitution forbid the Executive Branch from countermanding Congress’s \npower of the purse in that manner.  Defendants’ actions must be set aside and enjoined. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, and 1361. \n11.

For more than forty years, the Endowment has provided funding \nto organizations working to promote democratic governance, human rights, and political \nfreedoms worldwide in some of the most challenging environments—including authoritarian \nregimes and areas in which non-state actors such as drug cartels and terrorist organizations \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 8 of 61\nsuppress fundamental political freedoms.  The Endowment does not directly or indirectly \nundertake any work in the United States.  \n24.  The Endowment traces its origins to President Ronald Reagan’s 1982 \nWestminster Address, delivered before the British Parliament in the midst of the Cold War.  \nPresident Reagan called for a new initiative to “foster the infrastructure of democracy” around \nthe world and announced that the United States would employ a bipartisan organization to \nsupport the “global campaign for democracy now gathering force.”2 \n25.  President Reagan’s leadership, together with that of the United States Congress, \nresulted in the formation of the Endowment as a private nonprofit organization, led by an \nindependent self-appointing Board of Directors, to be funded by Congress.  In 1983 and on an \noverwhelming and bipartisan basis, Congress passed the National Endowment for Democracy \nAct (the “NED Act”), which formally recognized the establishment of the Endowment as a \nprivate foundation authorized to receive federal funding through congressional appropriation.  \nSee 22 U.S.C. § 4411 et seq. \n26.  In the NED Act, Congress set forth several statutory purposes that the \nEndowment is to pursue.  The Endowment’s mandate is to “encourage free and democratic \ninstitutions throughout the world through private sector initiatives, including activities which \npromote the individual rights and freedoms (including internationally recognized human rights) \nwhich are essential to the functioning of democratic institutions.”  22 U.S.C. § 4411(b)(1).  The \nEndowment is also devoted to promoting “democratic training programs and democratic \ninstitution-building abroad,” “strengthen[ing] democratic electoral processes abroad,” and \n \n2 Address to Members of the British Parliament, Palace of Westminster, London, England (June \n8, 1982), https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-members-british-parliament. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 9 of 61\n“encourag[ing] the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent \nboth with the broad concerns of United States national interests and with the specific \nrequirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by programs funded by \n[the Endowment].”  Id.  \n27.  The Endowment serves its mission of promoting freedom and democracy \nworldwide principally by operating as a grantmaking institution.  The Endowment funds four \n“core institutes” to fulfill the NED Act’s mandate of promoting exchanges between democratic \ngroups abroad and private sector initiatives, including “the two major American political parties, \nlabor, and business.”  See 22 U.S.C. § 4411(b)(2).  The Endowment’s core institutes are the \nNational Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, the Center for International \nPrivate Enterprise, and the Solidarity Center.  The Endowment directs around one third of its \ntotal appropriation to these core institutes, as required by the appropriation.  The core institutes \nensure that the Endowment’s programs represent the full breadth of American political life, with \nthe institutes associated with both of the major political parties, as well as labor and business. \n28.  In addition to funding the core institutes, the Endowment funds approximately \n1,700 individual projects active in over 100 countries.  Through this grant program, the \nEndowment discretionarily funds a network of frontline activists seeking to advance freedom in \ntheir own countries.  The Endowment’s grantees include organizations devoted to documenting \nhuman rights abuses and ensuring access to a free press, with an emphasis on the world’s most \nauthoritarian regimes.  Some of the Endowment’s grantees must keep their relationship to the \nEndowment discreet, given the sensitivity of their work in their home jurisdictions and the \npersonal risks the work entails.   \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 10 of 61\n29.  The Endowment regularly invests in grantees who work in repressive or conflict-\ntorn countries to foster peaceful efforts toward democracy.  In more open societies, the \nEndowment supports citizen groups working to strengthen democratic institutions and processes.  \nThe Endowment’s record speaks for itself:  Many of the nations in which the Endowment and its \ncore institutes have strategically invested over the years ultimately made the transition to \ndemocracy, including Chile, Indonesia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, \nMongolia, Ghana, countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and others.  And even societies that \nare already democracies welcome and invite the Endowment’s support.  These countries—which \ninclude many U.S. allies—believe the Endowment’s work helps them make their democratic \ninstitutions and processes more effective, strengthens citizen engagement, and fosters \naccountable governance and the rule of law, helping them attract investment, achieve economic \ngrowth, and deliver for their citizens.  In that way, the Endowment is engaged in the critical \nlong-haul work of pursuing a more democratic, stable, and prosperous world—a goal that the \nEndowment’s founders and members of both parties have long recognized as furthering United \nStates economic and security interests. \n30.  The Endowment’s unique structure allows it to function on an extremely cost-\neffective basis, ensuring that the vast majority of its appropriated funds go directly to grantees’ \ndemocracy-supporting work.  Eighty-three percent of the Endowment’s funding goes directly to \ngrantees.  Importantly, grantees do not receive those funds upfront.  Funding for all grantees is \ntied to submission of scheduled progress reports and other deliverables.  Even the core institutes \nmust request payment drawdowns against their cash needs as they go.   \n31.  The Endowment’s spending and operations are subject to rigorous financial \ncontrols and reporting requirements.  Pursuant to the NED Act, the Endowment conducts annual \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 11 of 61\nindependent audits of its accounts, the results of which it provides to Congress as part of its \nannual report.  22 U.S.C. § 4413(e), (h).  The Endowment’s financial transactions are also \nsubject to audit by the Government Accountability Office and the State Department, the reports \nof which must also be reported to Congress.  22 U.S.C. § 4413(f), (g).  And the Endowment’s \nbipartisan, experienced Board of Directors provides robust oversight of the Endowment’s \nfinancials, ensuring that its funds are used only for grants and activities consistent with its \nstatutory mandate.  More specifically, the Budget, Audit, and Administration Committee of the \nBoard of Directors manages the Endowment’s audit process, financial reporting, and compliance \nfunctions.  \n32.  The Endowment’s mission of advancing the cause of liberty and democracy \naround the world is nonpartisan, and the Endowment is bipartisan by design.  The Endowment’s \nself-appointed Board of Directors is bipartisan; it includes two members from the House and two \nhonorary members from the Senate, with a Republican and a Democrat from each chamber.  The \nEndowment funds both the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican \nInstitute.  As President Reagan explained, “One of the strengths of this organization is that it is \nconstructed on a bipartisan basis.”3   \n33.  The private, nongovernmental nature of the Endowment’s work is also essential to \nits structure and purpose.  The Endowment’s mandate is to support private American groups \nforging relationships with and supporting private groups abroad in pursuit of democratic goals \naround the world. \n \n3 Ronald Reagan, Message to the Congress Transmitting the Annual Report of the National \nEndowment for Democracy (Feb. 19, 1986), https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/\nmessage-congress-transmitting-annual-report-national-endowment-democracy. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 12 of 61\n34.  In the forty-two years since its founding, leaders from across the political \nspectrum have hailed the Endowment’s work.  Shortly after its founding, President Reagan \nproclaimed that the “establishment of the National Endowment goes right to the heart of \nAmerica’s faith in democratic ideals and institutions.  It offers hope to people everywhere.”4   \n35.  President Jimmy Carter praised the Endowment and core institutes’ work \noverseeing the balloting for Indonesia’s first free election in more than 40 years.  President \nCarter explained that “[t]he creation of the NED in the 1980s reflected a bipartisan belief that the \npromotion of freedom is an enduring American interest and that nongovernmental \nrepresentatives would best be able to help their counterparts build democracy in other \ncountries.”5  \n36.  President Bill Clinton has commended the Endowment as “one of our most \neffective means for supporting grass-roots trade union, business and citizen groups, which form \nthe basis for democratic reform.”  As President Clinton explained, “[b]y fostering such reforms \nabroad, we not only project our own values, we also increase our own security and create better \npartners for trade and global problem solving.”6 \n37.  President George W. Bush praised “the bipartisan spirit” of the Endowment, \ndescribing the Endowment’s work “promoting women’s rights, and training Iraqi journalists, and \n \n4 President Ronald Reagan’s Remarks at a White House Ceremony Inaugurating the National \nEndowment for Democracy (December 16, 1983), https://www.ned.org/president-ronald-\nreagans-remarks-at-a-white-house-ceremony-inaugurating-the-national-endowment-for-\ndemocracy/. \n5 Jimmy Carter and Paul Wolfowitz, Don’t Take Democracy for Granted (July 20, 1999), \nhttps://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1389.html. \n6 140 Cong.

Bush before him recognized that the \nEndowment’s “work is giving expression to the oldest and noblest tradition of this country—the \ndevotion to freedom for all humanity.”9 \n38.  In 2017, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, formerly a board member of the \nEndowment-funded International Republican Institute, celebrated the Endowment’s grantees, \napplauding their “courage” and “drive to combat corruption, press for transparency and \naccountability and advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world.”  Secretary \nRubio thanked the Endowment for its work to “advance the cause of freedom and carry out the \nvision President Reagan articulated those many years ago.”10   \nB.  The Endowment Is Funded By Direct Congressional Appropriation \n39.  From its inception, the Endowment was structured to ensure continuity of funding \nand independence.  Unlike other nongovernmental organizations, which receive funds at the \ndiscretion of federal agencies, the Endowment is funded through annual appropriations directly \nfrom Congress.   \n40.  In the NED Act, Congress directed the Department of State to convey the \nEndowment’s annual appropriation to it.  The NED Act provides that the Department of State \n \n7 Remarks by President George W.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) on NED’s 2017 Democracy Awardees, National Endowment for \nDemocracy (posted June 7, 2017), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPihC7UQ9jk&t=15s.  \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 14 of 61\n“shall make an annual grant to the Endowment to enable the Endowment to carry out its \npurposes as specified in section 4411(b) of this title” and that “[s]uch grants shall be made with \nfunds specifically appropriated for grants to the Endowment.”  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a) (emphasis \nadded).11  Section 4412 thus leaves the Department of State with no discretion:  It must make an \nannual grant to the Endowment each year with the funds appropriated by Congress for that very \npurpose.   \n41.  To enable that annual grant, Congress appropriates funds each year for the \nEndowment’s use.  It has done so every year since the Endowment’s founding.  For fiscal year \n2024, for instance, Congress provided in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act:  “For \ngrants made by the Department of State to the National Endowment for Democracy, as \nauthorized by the National Endowment for Democracy Act (22 U.S.C. 4412), $315,000,000, to \nremain available until expended, of which $210,316,000 shall be allocated in the traditional and \ncustomary manner, including for the core institutes, and $104,684,000 shall be for democracy \nprograms.”  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 737 \n(2024).  Although the amount of the appropriation has varied from year to year, the basic \nstatutory command has not.  Congress has consistently directed that the full appropriated amount \n“shall be allocated” to the Endowment: a portion is earmarked for the Endowment’s core \ninstitutes from the funds that “shall be allocated in the traditional and customary manner,” and \nanother portion “shall be for” the Endowment’s democracy programs.  In addition, the \nappropriated amount is to “remain available” to the Endowment “until expended.”  The \n \n11 As adopted, the NED Act identified the United States Information Agency, which was \nconsolidated with the Department of State in 1999 pursuant to the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998.  See Federal Register, United States Information Agency, \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/united-states-information-agency. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 15 of 61\nDepartment of State thus has no discretion to make less than the full appropriated amount \navailable to the Endowment. \n42.  In the appropriations process, Congress has unambiguously confirmed that the \nDepartment of State lacks substantive control over the Endowment’s expenditures.  The fiscal \nyear 2024 appropriations act, for example, specified that funds appropriated “under the heading \n‘National Endowment for Democracy’ may be made available notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law” and “notwithstanding any . . . regulation.”  Id. § 7032(b)(1).  The act further \nspecified that the funds were “made available pursuant to the authority of” the NED Act, \n“including all decisions regarding the selection of beneficiaries,” id. § 7032(b)(2)—meaning the \nfunds were subject to the NED Act’s directive that only the Endowment and its officers may \ndecide which activities the Endowment will fund, see 22 U.S.C. § 4412(a).   The accompanying \nHouse Report drove the point home, stating that “[f]unds made available under this heading shall \ncontinue to be provided directly to” the Endowment and “shall not be subject to prior approval \nby the Department of State.”  H.R. Rep. No. 118-146, at 34 (2023). \n43.  The Endowment’s appropriation appears in Title I of the Department of State \nForeign Operations and Related Programs (“SFOPS”) appropriations legislation.  Title I of the \nappropriations legislation is directed to Department of State operations and diplomatic programs, \nas well as certain “foreign affairs-focused nongovernmental organizations,” including the \nEndowment.12  By contrast, appropriations for United States foreign assistance, including \n \n12 See Cory Gill & Emily M. McCabe, Cong. Res. Serv., R40482, Department of State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs Appropriations: A Guide to Component Accounts 1, 8 \n(2025), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40482. \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 16 of 61\nappropriations for discretionary foreign-assistance grants, appear in other titles of the \nappropriations legislation, including Titles III and IV.13 \n44.  Historically, the Title I appropriations described above have made up \napproximately 95% of the Endowment’s funding.  The Endowment has also received certain \nforeign-assistance funding under Title III, which has comprised approximately 5% of its funding \nin past years.  In that latter category, the State Department has terminated $6 million to support \nthe Endowment’s Cuba program.  However, the Endowment’s Title III funding is not at issue \nhere.  \n45.  Once the congressional appropriation is enacted and signed into law, OMB \n“apportions,” or distributes, the funds, which makes them available for the spending agency \n(here, the State Department) to obligate or expend.  See GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 2-27 (4th ed. 2016) (“GAO Redbook”); GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in \nthe Federal Budget Process 12-13 (Sept. 2005) (“Federal Budget Glossary”); 31 U.S.C. \n§§ 1513(b), 1517(a)(1).14  When an appropriation is available for a definite period, OMB is \ngenerally required to apportion it “to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would \nindicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation for the period.”  31 U.S.C. \n§ 1512(a).  When an appropriation is available for an indefinite period, OMB is required to \napportion it “to achieve the most effective and economical use.”  Id.  And regardless of whether \nthe appropriation is definite or indefinite, OMB is required to apportion funds by time period, by \nagency activity, or by a combination of the two.  Id. \n \n13 Id. at 1.  \n14 The apportionment obligation is assigned by statute to the President, who has delegated the \nauthority to the Director of OMB.  See Notice; Delegation of Apportionment Authority, 90 Fed. \nReg. 9737 (Feb. 18, 2025), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/18/2025-\n02720/notice-delegation-of-apportionment-authority. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 17 of 61\n46.  Apportionment is an administrative step.  It allows the Executive Branch, acting \nthrough OMB, to calibrate the funding schedule, but only to ensure efficient and orderly \nspending of the amounts Congress has appropriated—not to frustrate the policy objectives of that \nappropriation.  See GAO, Office of Management and Budget—Withholding of Ukraine Security \nAssistance, B-331564, at 6-7 (Jan. 16, 2020).  Indeed, OMB may not delay or withhold \napportionment of funds for policy reasons.  The statute permits OMB to withhold appropriated \nfunding—to “establish[]” a “reserve”—“only” “to provide for contingencies,” to “achieve \nsavings made possible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of \noperations,” or “as specifically provided by law”  31 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(1); GAO Redbook 2-48 \nn.56.  Creating a reserve for any other purpose or under any other circumstance is unlawful. \n47.  The NED Act and the appropriations acts require OMB to apportion the \nEndowment’s appropriated funds to the State Department for obligation to the Endowment.  The \nNED Act requires the State Department to convey the Endowment’s annual appropriation to it in \na grant.  And, together with the appropriations acts, the NED Act requires that the State \nDepartment convey the entire sum that Congress has appropriated for the Endowment’s use.  The \nState Department cannot carry out these administrative steps and obligate the Endowment’s \nfunds until OMB apportions the money.  See 31 U.S.C. § 1517(a)(1).  Accordingly, the NED Act \nand the appropriations acts leave OMB no discretion to decline to apportion the Endowment’s \nappropriated funds. \n48.  The NED Act and the appropriations acts place limits not only on whether but \nalso on how OMB may exercise its authority to apportion the Endowment’s funds.  These \nstatutes require OMB to apportion the Endowment’s funding in the fiscal year in which the \nfunding is appropriated.  The NED Act makes express that Congress intended for the \n  17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 18 of 61\nEndowment to operate on an annual funding cycle.  See 22 U.S.C. § 4412(a) (directing the State \nDepartment to make an “annual grant”); id. § 4413(e) (calling for the Endowment to be “audited \nannually” by an independent accountant); id. § 4413(i) (calling for an “annual report”); see also \nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47 (2024).  And the Appropriations \nCommittees confirm that understanding by routinely directing the Endowment, within 45 days of \nenactment of an appropriations act, to submit a planning report “on the proposed uses of funds \nprovided” by Congress for the Endowment, “on a regional and country basis,” including a \n“description of programmatic goals for each region and country and how the planned use of \nfunds will meet such goals.”  E.g., H.R. Rep. No. 118-146, at 35.  The Endowment follows that \ndirective by providing Congress with a planning report describing how it intends to spend every \ndollar appropriated by Congress in that fiscal year.  The Endowment is further directed to \n“consult with the Committees on Appropriations in advance of any significant deviation from the \nplans outlined in [that] report.”  Id. \n49.  Consistent with that requirement and shared understanding, OMB has historically \napportioned the full annual amount in the fiscal year of its appropriation, confirming that doing \nso reflects the appropriation’s most “effective and economical use.”  See 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a).  \nOMB cannot legally thwart the annual funding structure Congress has chosen for the \nEndowment by refusing to apportion money appropriated in a particular year, especially against \nthe backdrop of the agency’s historical practice. \n50.  After the funding is apportioned, the Department of State has the administrative \nobligation to transfer it to the Endowment.  The Department of State’s Bureau for Democracy, \nHuman Rights, and Labor (“DRL”) serves as the passthrough bureau that administers the \nEndowment’s annual appropriation award together with the Office of Acquisitions Management, \n  18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 19 of 61\nlocated within the Department of State’s Bureau for Administration, which serves as DRL’s \ngrants office.   \n51.  Pursuant to the NED Act, the Department of State (acting through DRL and the \nOffice of Acquisitions Management) issues the award to the Endowment for the appropriated \namount, thereby “obligating” the funds to be paid to the Endowment by the Executive Branch.  \nAs required by the NED Act, the Department of State uses a grant agreement to structure the \ntransfer.  The NED Act sets out the terms for this process:  \nSuch grants shall be made pursuant to a grant agreement between the Director and the \nEndowment which requires that grant funds will only be used for activities which the Board \nof Directors of the Endowment determines are consistent with the purposes described in \nsection 4411(b) of this title, that the Endowment will allocate funds in accordance with \nsubsection (e) of this section, and that the Endowment will otherwise comply with the \nrequirements of this subchapter.  The grant agreement may not require the Endowment \nto comply with requirements other than those specified in this subchapter. \n \n22 U.S.C. § 4412(a) (emphases added).   \nThus, the Department of State has no statutory authority to impose additional conditions on the \nEndowment’s use of the appropriated funds beyond those already set forth by Congress in the \nNED Act.   \n52.  After the Department of State obligates the appropriated funds to the Endowment, \ncertain other agencies are involved in the mechanical process of transferring the funds to the \nEndowment.   \n53.  The annual appropriation award obligated to the Endowment is set aside for the \nEndowment in an account held at the Department of Treasury.  The Endowment cannot obtain \nthe balance of its appropriated funds all at once.  Federal regulations provide that the Endowment \nmay access its appropriated funds only by regularly requesting drawdowns from its Treasury \naccount on an as-needed basis as it incurs expenses.  See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.305, 600.101(a) \n  19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 20 of 61\n(“payment methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the \nFederal Agency . . . and the disbursement of funds by the recipient”).  Those expenses include \nthe Endowment’s operational spending, the core institutes’ appropriated spending, and payments \nto discretionary grantees.  This payment structure effectively forces the Endowment to operate \npayment-to-payment and constrains its ability to maintain a significant cash reserve.  To ensure \nthat it can fund its own operations, as well as the operations of the core institutes and grantees, \nthe Endowment typically submits two drawdown requests every week.   \n54.  Though it is the Department of State that administers the Endowment’s \nappropriated funds, and the Department of Treasury that holds its funds and disburses payments, \nthe Endowment’s drawdown requests are processed through a system called Payment \nManagement Services (“PMS”), administered by HHS’s Program Support Center.  The PMS \nportal is a shared system for processing grant payments used by various agencies across the \nfederal government.   \n55.  Typically, DRL approves the Endowment’s drawdown requests through the PMS \nportal in less than 48 hours.  After that, the Endowment’s appropriated funds are transferred from \nits account at the Department of Treasury to the Endowment’s bank account, usually within 24 \nhours.  No statute gives any agency involved in ensuring that the Endowment receives its \ncongressionally appropriated and Department of State-obligated funding any discretion to \nwithhold timely delivery of that funding or to second guess the decision to award it. \nC.  The Executive Branch’s Campaign to Impound the Endowment’s Funds \n56.  Even before the current administration began, it was widely reported that the \nEndowment’s funding would be targeted for elimination.  For instance, on December 3, 2024, \nThe New Criterion reported that the incoming President’s planned Department of Government \nEfficiency (“DOGE”) intended to “cut or severely reduce[] [the] scale” of the Endowment’s \n  20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 21 of 61\nprograms.15  And on December 10, The Wall Street Journal described the Endowment as \n“coming under assault” and “reportedly near the top of the Department of Government \nEfficiency’s hit list.”16 \n57.  High-level executive officials and their close affiliates continued to criticize the \nEndowment after President Trump’s inauguration.  On February 2, 2025, Elon Musk posted on \nX.com, arguing that “[a]nyone with integrity needs to resign from” the Endowment and that it \n“needs to be dissolved.”17  He also baselessly contended that the Endowment is an “evil \norganization,”18 that its employees are “crim[inals],”19 and that the organization “is RIFE with \nCORRUPTION!!”20   \n58.  On February 7, 2025, the Center for Renewing America, a think tank founded by \nDefendant and OMB Director Russell Vought, added its voice to the mix, publishing an article \nchock full of unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims that enumerated its policy objections to the \nEndowment.21  The article described the Endowment as a “fully partisan political weapon aimed \n \n15 James Piereson, The DOGE versus the NED, New Criterion (Dec. 3, 2024), https://\nnewcriterion.com/dispatch/the-doge-versus-the-ned/. \n16 William A.

A second piece, published by the Center \nfor Renewing America on the same day, falsely described the Endowment as an “irredeemably \ncorrupt” organization “that operates as a front for the State Department and Central Intelligence \nAgency” and “serves as the tip of the proverbial iceberg for a sprawling censorship industrial \ncomplex.”22 \n59.  Under Defendant Vought’s direction, OMB officials have continued to voice their \nstrenuous objections to Congress’s decision to fund the Endowment’s work, again by resort to \nfalsehoods and misleading allegations.  On May 2, OMB submitted the President’s budget \nrequest for fiscal year 2026 to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.  The proposal called for \neliminating any appropriation to the Endowment—despite the NED Act’s requirement that the \nEndowment receive annual funding “to enable the Endowment to carry out its purposes.”  22 \nU.S.C. § 4412(a).  The OMB cover memorandum explained the President’s budget “eliminates \nfunding for NED” because “NED blocked public access to its grant details,” “funded [a] Ukraine \ndisinformation organization,” and “funded the now-infamous Disinformation Index Foundation \nthat targeted and blacklisted conservative [American] media outlets.”23  An accompanying fact \nsheet entitled “Ending Weaponization of the Federal Government” elaborated that the “Ukraine \n \nprimer-the-national-endowment-for-democracy-and-an-ngo-ecosystem-actively-undermining-\namerica/. \n22 Wade Miller, Policy Brief: Dismantle Entities Actively Censoring Americans, Ctr. for \nRenewing Am.

As the Endowment has detailed at length elsewhere, these claims are misleading \nat best and patently false at worst.25  In truth, the Endowment never provided funding to the \nUkrainian organization that OMB seemingly referenced.  Similarly, the Endowment never \nfunded, supported, or authorized any work by the Disinformation Index Foundation or its \naffiliates to target U.S. media outlets .  And as for the insinuation that the Endowment has \nflouted transparency requirements by blocking public access to its grant details, the Endowment  \nhas fully complied with all legal disclosure requirements and provides regular briefings to \nMembers of Congress and congressional staff.  At the same time, the Endowment has taken \nnecessary precautions to safeguard grantees in high-risk environments.  For example, just prior \nto the Russian invasion of Ukraine, National Security Council officials notified the Endowment \nthat its grantees were on Russian “kill and capture” lists, prompting the Endowment temporarily \nto remove its public grants listings to protect those partners.  The Endowment has since \npublished a complete list of all active grants for fiscal year 2024 on its website.26   \n61.

The Executive Branch Denied the Endowment Access to Obligated, \nCongressionally Appropriated Funds \n62.  Meanwhile, Executive Branch officials quietly moved to block the Endowment’s \nability to pursue its congressionally recognized mission by attempting to impound its \ncongressionally appropriated funding. \n63.  By the end of January 2025, the Endowment held a cash balance of $167 million \nof congressionally appropriated funds in its Treasury account.  In the first fiscal year 2025 \nContinuing Resolution (Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 (Sept. 24, 2024)), \nCongress had appropriated additional funds to the Endowment based on its fiscal year 2024 \nappropriation, amounting to $69,898,500.  Around January 15, 2025, the Department of State \nobligated the $69,898,500 in appropriated funds to the Endowment for payment by the Executive \nBranch.  The $167 million cash balance in the Endowment’s Treasury account included that \namount, as well as other available, already-obligated funds from prior years’ annual \n \n27 Damon Linker, Who Is Russell Vought?, N.Y.

These funds are referred to here as “tranche 1” funds.  Ordinarily, the full \n$167 million would have been available to the Endowment to draw down at its discretion, \nconsistent with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.305, 600.101(a), to pay its operational expenses and fulfill its \npayment obligations to grantees. \n64.  On January 21, 2025, the Endowment requested from PMS a drawdown totaling \n$36,663,100 from its appropriated funds to pay for its operational expenses and grants.  DRL \nultimately approved that request, but only after receiving confirmation that the funds requested \nwere congressionally appropriated Title I funds, and that they were therefore not subject to a \nJanuary 20, 2025 Executive Order titled “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign \nAid.”  Exec. Order No. 14169, 90 Fed. Reg. 8619 (2025).  That Executive Order paused certain \nforeign assistance—but, as the Department of State itself has explained, only those funds \nappropriated under Title III and Title IV of SFOPS and to “International Organizations and \nPrograms” under Title V.  The Endowment’s Title I funds thus were not (and could not be) \nsubject to the Executive Order.  After the Endowment explained to DRL staff that its payment \nrequest concerned congressionally appropriated Title I funds not subject to the Executive Order, \nDRL approved the Endowment’s request.   \n65.  Until the Executive Branch began refusing to disburse the Endowment’s funds, \nthe Endowment’s activities had been continuing in the ordinary course. \n66.  On January 28 and January 30, 2025 the Endowment submitted drawdown \nrequests totaling approximately $97 million of its obligated, congressionally appropriated funds.  \nThe Endowment made the request to cover grantee expense reimbursements and advance \npayments, the Endowment’s own operational expenses, and payments for new core institute \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 26 of 61\nprojects and discretionary grantees that recently had been approved by the Endowment’s Board \nat its regular January meeting. \n67.  With its PMS requests still pending on January 31, 2025, the Endowment reached \nout to DRL for a status update.  In the Endowment’s experience, a multi-day delay is highly \nunusual.  In the ordinary course, if the Endowment requests funds before 1:00 p.m., it receives \nthem the next business day; requests made after 1:00 p.m. are received on the second business \nday.  That promptness is necessitated by federal regulations that require payment methods to \n“minimize” the time between the transfer of funds from the government and the disbursement by \nthe recipient.  2 C.F.R. §§ 200.305(b), 600.101(a).  \n68.  DRL staff responded that they were “working on it,” and by 3:00 p.m. that \nafternoon, the Endowment’s finance team saw that the requests were “approved” in the PMS \nsystem. \n69.  Beginning on January 31, however, those “approved” payment requests were \nmarked in PMS with a status that the Endowment had never before seen: “in transit.” \n70.  On February 6, 2025, the White House issued a memorandum to the heads of \nexecutive departments and agencies directing them to “review all funding that agencies provide \nto [nongovernmental organizations (“NGOs”)] . . . on the basis of applicable authorizing statutes, \nregulations, and terms.”30  The Department of State never expressed that it was relying on that \nmemorandum as justification for refusing to make available the Endowment’s appropriated Title \nI funds.  The memorandum did not purport to freeze or discontinue funds pending executive \n \n30 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (Feb. 6, 2025), available \nat, https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-\nexecutive-departments-and-agencies/.

In all events, an Executive Branch memorandum cannot provide authority to freeze or \ndiscontinue the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funding. \n71.  On February 11, the Endowment wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \nrequesting the release of its appropriated funds, payment of which the Department of State had \napproved on January 31.  The letter reiterated that the funds in question are Title I funds and, \ntherefore, not subject to the January 20 Executive Order on foreign aid. \n72.  The next day, the Endowment’s grant officer representative at DRL emailed to \nask whether the Endowment had any outstanding payment requests in PMS.  She requested \nspecific information, including screenshots, for each PMS request and advised the Endowment \nthat “submissions are subject to further review within the Department of State that may require \nadditional processing for approval.” \n73.  The Endowment promptly responded with the requested information and to \nindicate that it was awaiting $97,581,876 in funding from PMS.  The Endowment included in its \nresponse a screenshot of the PMS system, which showed three pending requests, all marked as \n“approved.” \n74.  More than a week later, on February 20, DRL invited the Endowment to submit \nan “Obligation or Disbursement under Waiver of Foreign Assistance Pause” form for its pending \nPMS requests, on the condition that the requests were for costs incurred prior to January 24, \n2025.  As noted, the administration’s January 24, 2025 foreign aid freeze, in place pursuant to \nthe January 20 Executive Order described above, did not and does not apply to the Endowment’s \nappropriated Title I funds.  But regardless, the Executive Branch lacks authority under the NED \n  27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 28 of 61\nAct and annual appropriations legislation to “freeze” or otherwise withhold the Endowment’s \nobligated, congressionally appropriated funds.   \n75.  On February 26, 2025, OMB issued a memorandum calling for data on foreign \nassistance funding.  See Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, OMB \nMemorandum M-25-08, Agency Foreign Assistance Review (FAR) Data Call 1.  The \nmemorandum directed that agencies by March 17, 2025 “review their foreign assistance \nprograms” and “make a recommendation on whether to continue, modify, or cease each foreign \nassistance program.”  Id. at 2.  Based on that data, the memorandum said that the “responsible \nDepartment and Agency heads, in consultation with the Director of OMB,” and “with [the] \nconcurrence of the Secretary of State,” would “make recommendations” “to the President for \nfinal determinations.”  Id. at 2–3.  The memorandum defined foreign assistance as including \n“any activity funded under Title 22 of the United States Code.”  Id.  The Department of State did \nnot assert that it was relying on this memorandum as justification for withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriated Title I funds.  The memorandum did not purport to freeze or \ndiscontinue funds pending executive review, and it therefore does not and cannot provide \nauthority to deny the Endowment its funding.  In all events, an Executive Branch memorandum \ncannot provide authority to freeze or discontinue the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated \nfunding.   \n76.  Defendants’ withholding of the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated, \nobligated funds was unprecedented. \n77.  Defendants thereby unreasonably and unlawfully impounded the Endowment’s \ncongressionally appropriated funds. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 29 of 61\nE.  The Executive Branch Refused to Obligate to the Endowment Its Annual \nAppropriation \n78.  During a similar time frame, on top of denying payment on the Endowment’s \napproved drawdown requests for already-obligated funding, the Department of State failed to \nobligate to the Endowment its second fiscal year 2025 Continuing Resolution obligation of \napproximately $72 million.  See Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. \nNo. 118-83, § 101, 138 Stat. 1524, 1524–1525 (2024); American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 118-\n158, 138 Stat. 1722 (2024).31 \n79.  On January 16, 2025, DRL informed the Endowment that it had “received the \nsecond tranche of NED’s FY 2025 funding in the amount of $72,481,500.”  DRL, through the \nOffice of Acquisitions Management, accordingly prepared to obligate to the Endowment its \nappropriated funds through an amendment to the current fiscal year 2025 annual appropriation \ngrant agreement. \n80.  DRL told the Endowment that the amendment obligating the Endowment’s \nappropriated funds was complete and ready to be issued. \n81.  Yet for over a month State refused to obligate, as required by statute, the second \ntranche of the Endowment’s fiscal year 2025 Title I annual appropriation funding.  \nOn February 20, 2025, an Office of Acquisitions Management grants officer told the Endowment \nthat he was waiting to “get guidance regarding NED Core Project funding and approvals” and \nwould alert the Endowment as soon as he got a response.  He did not specify from whom he was \nawaiting guidance or what legal authority would allow the Department of State to do anything \n \n31 These funds can be referred to as “tranche 2” funds, and, like tranche 1, they are entirely Title \nI funds. \n  29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 30 of 61\nother than obligate the funds that Congress has appropriated to the Endowment.  The \nEndowment responded to again confirm that its core annual appropriation is Title I funding.   \n82.  Defendants’ unilateral refusal to obligate the Endowment’s appropriated funds \nwas unprecedented. \n83.  Defendants thereby unreasonably and unlawfully impounded the Endowment’s \ncongressionally appropriated funds. \nF.  The Impoundment Threw the Endowment Into Crisis \n84.  By the beginning of March 2025, the Executive Branch’s impoundment of the \nEndowment’s appropriated funds had caused the Endowment to suffer an unprecedented cash \nflow crisis that jeopardized its very existence and ability to fulfill its mission. \n85.  As of March 1, the Endowment had furloughed 62% of its staff and was on the \nverge of having no choice but to take further steps to reduce personnel costs, including additional \nfurloughs and even layoffs.  The Endowment had also already been forced to reduce salaries and \ntake other related personnel actions, such as moving employees to part-time status.  These \nmeasures affected 100% of the Endowment’s employees.  Beyond the immediate financial strain, \nthese cuts had far-reaching consequences—undermining the Endowment’s ability to safeguard \nsensitive information, support democracy advocates, and maintain grantee relationships in closed \nsocieties. \n86.  Given the nature of the Endowment’s work advancing freedom, it is a frequent \ntarget of cyber threats from hostile foreign adversaries.  The furloughs deprived the Endowment \nof essential personnel responsible for protecting grantee data, preventing cyberattacks, and \nsafeguarding the Endowment’s digital infrastructure.  It was at risk of a data breach, which could \nhave exposed democratic activists and civil society organizations in authoritarian states, putting \ntheir security, and potentially their lives, at risk. \n  30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 31 of 61\n87.  The Endowment also lost employees who have skills in critical areas, including \nlanguage, regional expertise, and technical fields.  The Endowment has spent years building a \nteam that collectively speaks more than 45 languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, \nArabic, Urdu, Tibetan, Lingala, and Swahili, which is essential to the Endowment’s work around \nthe globe, including in Iran, China, Venezuela, and Pakistan.  Threats to this expertise risk the \nEndowment’s access, understanding, and key relationships, which have been developed over \ndecades and cannot be easily rebuilt. \n88.  Without the ability to draw down its appropriated funds, the Endowment did not \nhave cash on hand to fund the core institutes or discretionary grantees.  For the first time in its \ndecades-long history, the Endowment failed to meet its financial obligations to the core institutes \nand grantees and, as a result, was forced to suspend nearly 1,300 grant projects worldwide. \n89.  Because the Endowment does not administer any programs directly, its grantees \nare fundamental to its ability to effectively carry out its mandate, as provided by Congress.  As a \nresult of Defendants’ impoundment, grantees faced harms that directly compromised the \nEndowment’s ability to fulfill its mandate, as recognized by Congress in the NED Act. \n90.  Grantees faced considerable hardship from the funding freeze, including: an \ninability to maintain broadcast and publication schedules, the undermining of their ability to \nretain audiences; an inability to meet tax, labor, and other local obligations; and an inability to \nimplement time-sensitive projects like election monitoring.  The freezing of the Endowment’s \nfunds posed special risk to partners operating in highly authoritarian contexts, as the sudden \ninterruption in support risked exposing their operations and staff as Endowment grantees, \nthereby inviting legal or other reprisal from authoritarian governments that oppose their work. \n  31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 32 of 61\n91.  The funding freeze threatened to harm the Endowment far into the future as well.  \nIt forced the Endowment to suspend its acceptance of any proposals for regularly scheduled \ngrantmaking cycles in May and September 2025.  The freeze also harmed the Endowment’s \nreputation.  The Endowment engages partners based on trust and mutual respect, and each \npartner enters into a grant agreement with the Endowment with the expectation that the \nfoundation will honor its financial and operational obligations.  The Endowment’s reputation is \ncritical to its ability to engage productively with partners worldwide and fulfill its mission.  And, \ngiven the harms experienced by grantees, the Endowment was deeply concerned that many \nwould simply not be around to continue their important work, even if the Endowment’s funding \nwere to resume at a later date.  \nG.  The Endowment Was Forced to Sue and the Executive Branch Released the \nEndowment’s Funds in Response \n92.  After weeks of beseeching Defendants to stop interfering with its congressionally \nappropriated funds and weeks of engaging extensively with Capitol Hill, the Endowment was \nforced to resort to litigation.  On March 5, 2025, the Endowment filed a complaint demanding \nthat Defendants cease their impoundment.  ECF No. 1.  The following day, the Endowment filed \na motion for a temporary restraining order.  ECF No. 5.  This Court set a briefing schedule, \ndirecting Defendants to file their opposition by 5:00 p.m. on March 11, 2025. \n93.  On Friday, March 7, the day after the Endowment filed its motion for a temporary \nrestraining order, counsel for Defendants emailed counsel for the Endowment to report that he \nwas “still conferring with [his] clients” and did not have “specific details” to “provide just yet,” \nbut that he “th[ought] there [was] a good chance that . . . [the Endowment’s] request for a \ntemporary restraining order[] could soon become moot.” \n  32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 33 of 61\n94.  On Monday, March 10, the Endowment received approximately $97 million in its \nbank account—the total amount that it had requested from PMS, but that Defendants had refused \nto disburse for weeks.  Defendants also represented that the relevant officials at the State \nDepartment were finalizing the Endowment’s long-overdue request to obligate the $72 million in \nfunding that had been appropriated by Congress in the second Continuing Resolution, but that \nthe State Department had thus far refused to obligate.  Defendants also represented that they \nexpected the obligation would be complete around the end of that week. \n95.  In light of these changed circumstances, the Endowment and Defendants jointly \nmoved to hold the proceedings on the Endowment’s motion for a temporary restraining order in \nabeyance.  ECF No. 14. \n96.  On March 19, the State Department obligated to the Endowment the \napproximately $72 million that Congress had appropriated in the second Continuing Resolution. \nH.  Executive Branch Officials Attempted To Find Another Mechanism to \nInterfere With the Endowment’s Mission \n97.  On the morning of Thursday, March 13, the Endowment submitted a drawdown \nrequest of $450,000 in PMS.  Although the Endowment typically receives a payment requested \nbefore 1:00 p.m. on the following business day, it did not receive the requested funds for eight \ndays.  The money came through only after State Department officials asked the Endowment \nwhether the drawdown was for expenses incurred prior to January 24, 2025, which they indicated \nwas necessary to support a “waiver.”  That inquiry did not make sense to the Endowment, which \ndoes not need a “waiver” to access its obligated funds, and which is statutorily entitled to \nreimbursement for expenses incurred both prior to and after January 24.  Counsel for Defendants \nchalked the delay up to new guidance on payment processes, and indicated that drawdown \nrequests would likely move faster in the future. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 34 of 61\n98.  On March 15, President Trump signed a third Continuing Resolution (Full-Year \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 (Mar. 14, 2025)), which appropriated funds \nfor the remainder of fiscal year 2025.  Like the first and second Continuing Resolutions, the \nEndowment’s appropriation was based on the funding it received in fiscal year 2024.  This third \nsum amounted to an additional $172,620,000, bringing the Endowment’s total appropriation for \nfiscal year 2025 to $315 million. \n99.  On the morning of March 31, the Endowment learned that OMB had apportioned \nto the State Department only a portion of the funds appropriated for the Endowment in the full-\nyear appropriations act.  In recent years, after Congress has passed and the President has signed a \nregular, full-year appropriations act, OMB has apportioned the entirety of the Endowment’s \nfunding within 30 days.32  However, on March 31, DRL reported that it had only received \naround $26 million of the Endowment’s $172 million appropriation.  Counsel for Defendants \npromised to investigate. \n100.  On April 17, counsel for Defendants reported that apportionment for the rest of \nthe fiscal year would be available only after the State Department submitted its full-year \nspending plan.  See ECF No. 17 (Joint Status Report of April 30, 2025). \n101.  On Thursday, April 24, just before 3:00 p.m., the Executive Branch tried a new \nline of attack: the Department of Governmental Efficiency (“DOGE”).  Endowment executives \nreceived an email from Marshall Wood, who identified himself as a “member of the DOGE team \n \n32 See Pub. L.

Order \nNo. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 29, 2025).  “If we do not hear from you,” Mr. Wood wrote, \n“we will assume you do not plan to comply with the President’s Executive Order.” \n102.  The threat to “onboard” a DOGE team was unlawful.  DOGE is a component of \nthe Executive Branch, and its authority extends only to government agencies.  See Exec. Order \nNo. 14158, § 3(c).  The Endowment is a “private, nonprofit corporation . . . which is not an \nagency or establishment of the United States Government.”  22 U.S.C. § 4411(a).  Congress has \nbeen explicit about the Endowment’s independent, nongovernmental status:  “Nothing [in the \nNED Act] shall be construed to make the Endowment an agency or establishment of the United \nStates Government or to make the members of the Board of Directors of the Endowment, or the \nofficers or employees of the Endowment, officers or employees of the United States.”  Id. \n§ 4412(c).  Installing a DOGE team in the Endowment would, at minimum, violate the \nEndowment’s statutory guarantee of independence and interfere with the NED Act’s directive \nthat the Endowment is neither an “agency” nor an “establishment of the United States \nGovernment.”  Id. §§ 4411(a), 4412(c).   \n103.  Further, earlier that month, DOGE team members had attempted to infiltrate other \nprivate nonprofit corporations that receive federal grants.33  And it had been widely reported that \n \n33 Perry Stein, DOGE sought to assign a team to an independent nonprofit group, Wash. Post \n(Apr. 16, 2025), https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/15/doge-musk-\nnonprofit-vera-institute/. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 36 of 61\nDOGE employees who had onboarded with federal agencies were abusing their data access and \nmishandling sensitive information.34 \n104.  That evening, counsel for the Endowment forwarded Mr. Wood’s email to \ncounsel for Defendants, noting that the Endowment is not an agency covered by the Executive \nOrder cited by Mr. Wood.  Counsel also reported that if DOGE did not stand down, the \nEndowment would be forced to seek a TRO.  The following morning, counsel for Defendants \nconveyed that the Endowment “should be receiving a clarifying communication soon.”  Within \nthe hour, Mr. Wood “clarif[ied]” that DOGE was “not seeking to onboard at this time.” \n105.  The Endowment proceeded to have a call with DOGE that same morning.  On \nthat call, the DOGE representatives refused to acknowledge the Endowment’s private, \nnongovernmental status, instead stating that they would not “litigate” that issue at this time. \n106.  Following the call, DOGE emailed Endowment leadership a list of 12 questions \nregarding the Endowment, its operations, and its compliance with the law.  The Endowment \nvoluntarily responded in writing to each question, while reiterating its private, nongovernmental \nstatus.  As of this filing, DOGE has yet to acknowledge in any communication with the \nEndowment that DOGE is barred by law from onboarding a team at the Endowment. \nI.  The Executive Branch Lands on a New Impoundment Mechanism \n107.  Meanwhile, OMB continued to withhold a full apportionment of the \nEndowment’s funds pending the State Department’s submission of a full-year spending plan.

On May 29, the State Department submitted a full-year spending plan to \nCongress.  Although OMB had only apportioned—and the State Department had only \nobligated—$220,059,030 of the Endowment’s $315,000,000 appropriation, the plan did not \nrequest apportionment of any additional funds in fiscal year 2025.  Instead, it specified that \n“[r]emaining resources may be made available for obligation in FY 2025 subject to review for \nalignment with Administration priorities.”  Exhibit 1 (State Department Spending Plan) at 54. \n109.  On June 11, counsel for Defendants informed counsel for the Endowment that the \nExecutive Branch had decided to withhold the ~$95 million balance of the funding appropriated \nfor the Endowment in fiscal year 2025.  Counsel stated that the State Department’s spending plan \n“contemplates reserving funds from State’s no-year FY25 appropriation for grants to NED for \nFY 2026.”  Exhibit 2 (DOJ E-Mail).  In a Joint Status Report submitted the following day, \nDefendants confirmed that the Executive Branch was “reserving” the remainder of the \nEndowment’s funding.  ECF No. 33 (Joint Status Report of June 12) at 2.  According to \nDefendants, “[i]n the past it may have been the case that NED received its funds as a lump sum \nonce a full-year appropriations Act was enacted; however, that is not required by the authorizing \nstatute nor the appropriation for NED.  In fact, because these are no-year funds, Congress \nspecifically permits State to obligate these funds for the relevant purposes in this fiscal year and \nany subsequent fiscal year ‘until expended.’  OMB is required to apportion no-year funds ‘to \nachieve the most effective and economical use.’”  Id. (citing 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a)).  Defendants \nconcluded: “[F]unding in this case requires apportionment for FY 2026 rather than additional \nobligations for FY 2025.”  Id.   \n  37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 38 of 61\n110.  Beyond Defendants’ communication through counsel and the subsequent filing of \na Joint Status Report, the Endowment has received no direct notification from the Executive \nBranch regarding this apportionment decision. \n111.  Defendants have thus refused to apportion, obligate, disburse, or otherwise make \navailable the remainder of the Endowment’s fiscal year 2025 appropriation. \n112.  Defendants have also made clear that they will continue to refuse to apportion, \nobligate, disburse, or otherwise make available the remainder of the Endowment’s fiscal year \n2025 appropriation at least through the end of the fiscal year, and they have provided no specific \ntimeline for the apportionment and obligation of that appropriation in fiscal year 2026 or beyond. \n113.  Defendants have refused to apportion, obligate, disburse, or otherwise make \navailable the remainder of the Endowment’s fiscal year 2025 appropriation because, in the \nExecutive Branch’s view, the Endowment’s use of those funds does not align with \nAdministration priorities. \n114.  No realistic “contingenc[y]” or reasonable possibility of “savings made possible \nby or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations” exists that could \njustify the creation of a reserve.  See 31 U.S.C. § 1512(c). \n115.  Defendants have thus, once again, unreasonably and unlawfully impounded the \nEndowment’s congressionally appropriated funds. \n116.  By withholding the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds for policy \nreasons, in the absence of any circumstance that could justify reserving funds, Defendants have \nestablished an unlawful reserve. \n117.  That the Endowment’s funding is provided in a “no-year appropriation” provides \nno justification for Defendants’ actions.  Congress’s decision to appropriate funds for the \n  38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 39 of 61\nEndowment in a no-year appropriation ensures that the Endowment can expend those funds at \nany time, in furtherance of the Endowment’s mission as set forth in the NED Act.  Defendants’ \ndecision to withhold those funds from apportionment and obligation frustrates the Endowment’s \nability to do precisely that.  Defendants’ action is unsupported by any plausibly reasonable \nexplanation and runs directly contrary to congressional intent.  \nJ.  Defendants Are Again Imposing Irreparable Harm on the Endowment \n118.  The withholding of the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds is \ncausing and, absent judicial relief, will continue to cause irreparable harm to the Endowment. \n119.  As OMB refused to apportion the full amount that Congress appropriated, and the \nEndowment lacked any certainty that a full apportionment was forthcoming, the Endowment has \nbeen forced to undertake significant operational reductions, including workforce cuts to 100 staff \nmembers—approximately 35 percent of the team.  Those cuts have led to substantial, \nunbudgeted severance and leave payouts.  They also have led to the halting of critical initiatives \nthat help to advance its mission, as well as attrition of valued employees and the loss of their \ncritical skills, institutional knowledge, and operational capacity.  These capabilities are not easily \nreplaced, and the losses severely compromise the Endowment’s organizational stability, business \ncontinuity, and strategic effectiveness.  Staff cuts also pose heightened security risks to the \nEndowment, including due to the loss of information security personnel, which increases the risk \nof adversaries launching a successful cyberattack.  If funds continue to be withheld, the \nEndowment will be compelled to explore additional steps, including the possibility of more staff \nreductions. \n120.  In addition, the significant financial uncertainty is directly impacting the \nEndowment’s core grantmaking mission.  Without its full appropriation, the Endowment will not \nbe able to support 500 of its direct partners and 67 core institute projects.  Many of these partners \n  39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 40 of 61\nand projects were explicitly outlined in the fiscal year 2025 annual planning document and \nwould be fully operational if not for Defendant’s unlawful withholding of appropriated funds.  \nThose projects are in direct furtherance of the Endowment’s mission; they would support critical \nelection monitoring, help democracy activists overcome censorship, maintain access to \nindependent news and information across many media environments, and advance reforms to \nlevel the playing field for American businesses and workers. \n121.  Defendants’ actions have also, once again, threatened the core institutes and direct \ngrantees that rely on the Endowment.  Without access to the full amount Congress appropriated, \nthe core institutes would need to delay, suspend, or cancel critical activities that promote \ndemocracy and freedom around the world.  They will also need to make further operational cuts, \npotentially including additional staffing reductions and office closures.  Endowment grantees \ntypically do not have the ability to maintain significant reserves, meaning that disruptions in their \nfunding could imperil their existence and again jeopardize grantee staff in certain circumstances \nwho rely on their employment to maintain their legal status in third countries and avoid returning \nto authoritarian regimes.  They would also face risks as to time-sensitive projects, including \nprojects relating to upcoming elections or emerging opportunities in the case of democratic \nopenings. \n122.  Finally, Defendants’ actions would irreparably harm the Endowment’s reputation \nby once again threatening the Endowment’s ability to make good on its promise as a trusted and \nreliable partner across the world.   \n  40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 41 of 61\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nAPA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Against All Defendants) \n123.  The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n124.  The APA provides that a court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law[,]” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity[,]” or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right[.]”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)–(C). \n125.  Defendants’ impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated \nfunding is final agency action reviewable under 5 U.S.C. § 704.  The denial of funding is \nreviewable “final agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  “[A]gency action” includes an agency’s \n“denial” of “recognition” to a “claim” or “right”; the “denial” of a “grant of money”; and the \n“failure to act” or “withholding” with respect to claims, rights, and grants of money.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(10), (11), (13).  Defendants’ actions are “final” because they are the “functional \nequivalent” of an express denial of payment—the consequences of Defendants’ impoundment of \nthe Endowment’s funds are identical to the consequences of an express statement of denial.  See \nLewis v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 743 F. Supp. 3d 181, 192 (D.D.C. 2024) (citation omitted).  \nIndeed, even if characterized as a suspension pending review pursuant to the Executive’s various \nongoing spending reviews, Defendants’ actions have had the effect of denying the Endowment \naccess to its congressionally appropriated funds. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 42 of 61\n126.  Defendants’ actions are contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority \nbecause the statutory scheme creates a mandatory, non-discretionary duty for Defendants to \napportion, obligate, disburse, and otherwise make available the Endowment’s congressionally \nappropriated funds.  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. \n118-47 (2024); 31 U.S.C. §§ 1512, 3325.  Defendants’ decision to indefinitely withhold from \napportionment ~$95 million of the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds violates this \nstatutory scheme.  \n127.  Defendants’ actions are also contrary to the United States Constitution because \nthey violate the Separation of Powers, as well as the Take Care Clause, the Appropriations \nClause, the Spending Clause, and the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. \n128.  Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because Defendants have \nfailed to provide a reasoned explanation for their actions; Defendants have failed to consider \nreliance interests of the Endowment, its core institutes, and its longstanding grantees; Defendants \nhave relied on factors which Congress did not intend for them to consider; and because \nDefendants’ actions threaten the Endowment’s continued existence, in direct contravention of \nCongress’s expressed intention that the Endowment shall use its appropriated funds to fulfill its \nmandate as reflected in the NED Act. \n129.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \n  42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 43 of 61\nEndowment.  In light of the current withholding of the Endowment’s funding and the broader \nExecutive Branch efforts to interfere with the Endowment’s mission, there is every reason to \nthink that Defendants’ wrongful withholding of the Endowment’s funds will persist and recur \nabsent judicial relief.   \n130.  Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n131.

The Department of the Treasury has a non-discretionary duty to disburse the \nfunds in its charge upon receipt of a properly executed voucher.  31 U.S.C. § 3325.  When HHS \nexercises delegated authority to disburse federal funds, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3321(a), 3322, it has the \nsame non-discretionary duty. \n135.  Treasury and HHS did not comply with that mandatory duty as it relates to the \nEndowment’s obligated funds located in its Treasury account and requested through the PMS \nsystem as of March 5, 2025 (that is, the tranche 1 funds). \n  43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 44 of 61\n136.

L. No. 118-47 (2024).  \n137.  The Department of State did not comply with that mandatory duty as it relates to \nthe Endowment’s obligated funds located in its Treasury account and requested through the PMS \nsystem.  Neither did the Department of State comply with that mandatory duty as it relates to the \nEndowment’s appropriated, apportioned funds, which the Department of State had received but \nhad not obligated as of March 5, 2025, despite preparing a grant-agreement amendment that was \nready to go.  The Department of State has also not complied with that mandatory duty as it \nrelates to those funds that were appropriated for obligation to the Endowment in fiscal year 2025, \nbut that still have not been obligated. \n138.  OMB has a non-discretionary duty to apportion the Endowment’s appropriated \nfunds to the State Department for obligation to the Endowment.  31 U.S.C. § 1512. \n139.  OMB has not complied with that mandatory duty as it relates to those funds that \nwere appropriated for obligation to the Endowment in fiscal year 2025 but that OMB has \ndeclined to apportion. \n140.  Defendants’ actions are also contrary to the United States Constitution because \nthey violate the Separation of Powers, as well as the Take Care Clause, the Appropriations \nClause, the Spending Clause, and the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. \n141.

Absent such relief, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, including to its \nability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for democracy and \nfreedom around the world. \n143.

Defendants have created a “reserv[e]” of, ECF No. 33, or otherwise refused to \napportion in fiscal year 2025, approximately $95 million that Congress specifically appropriated \nfor obligation to the Endowment in fiscal year 2025.  That is final agency action reviewable \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 704.  To be final, an agency action “must mark the ‘consummation’ of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process” and “be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been \ndetermined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177-78 (1997) (citation omitted).  The decision to establish a reserve with the balance of the \nEndowment’s appropriated funds for fiscal year 2025, or otherwise to withhold such funds from \napportionment this fiscal year, is neither “tentative” nor “interlocutory.”  Id. at 178.  And that \napportionment decision determines “rights,” id., because it dictates when the Endowment’s \nfunding becomes legally eligible for obligation, 31 U.S.C. § 1517(a). \n  49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 50 of 61\n164.  Defendants’ actions are contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority.  To \nthe extent Defendants have attempted to create a reserve, that action is unlawful.  “[A] reserve \nmay be established only . . . (A) to provide for contingencies; (B) to achieve savings made \npossible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations; or (C) as \nspecifically provided by law.”  31 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(1).  None of those circumstances is present.  \nInstead, the Executive Branch has withheld the Endowment’s funds on the impermissible ground \nthat, in the view of Defendants, Congress’s decision to fund the Endowment does not align with \nthe Administration’s policy priorities.  The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits the Executive Branch \nfrom using apportionment to “implement[] policy impoundments.”  City of New Haven v. United \nStates, 809 F.2d 900, 906 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  There is no basis in the Anti-Deficiency Act or any \nother law for the withholding of the Endowment’s funds.  See 31 U.S.C. § 1512. \n165.  Defendants’ actions are also contrary to the United States Constitution because \nthey violate the Separation of Powers, as well as the Take Care Clause, the Appropriations \nClause, the Spending Clause, and the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. \n166.  To the extent Defendants have determined that withholding the remainder of the \nEndowment’s fiscal year 2025 appropriation is the “most effective and economical use” of those \nfunds, 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a), they have exceeded their statutory authority.  Abruptly starving the \nEndowment of money that the Endowment had intended to expend this year to carry out \nprograms in service of its mission cannot possibly be an effective or economical use of funds \nCongress appropriated to the Endowment for that very purpose.  \n167.  Any determination that withholding the remainder of the Endowment’s fiscal year \n2025 appropriation is the “most effective and economical use” of those funds, id., is arbitrary and \ncapricious because Defendants have failed to provide a reasoned explanation for their actions; \n  50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 51 of 61\nDefendants have failed to consider reliance interests of the Endowment, its core institutes, and its \nlongstanding grantees; Defendants have relied on factors which Congress did not intend for them \nto consider; Defendants have departed from past practice without justification; and Defendants \nhave offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence or is implausible.  \n168.

City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 439–40 (1998) (citation \nomitted).  The President cannot delegate powers to other executive branch officials that violate \nthe Constitution. \n174.  Both the NED Act and the congressional appropriations laws mandating that \nfunds be provided to the Endowment, including for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, are duly enacted \nlegislation that leave no room for executive discretion. \n175.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally \nappropriated funds therefore amounts to an attempt to amend, modify, or partially veto duly \nenacted legislation in violation of the Presentment Clause.   \n176.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \nEndowment.  In light of the current withholding of the Endowment’s funding and the broader \nExecutive Branch efforts to interfere with the Endowment’s mission, there is every reason to \n  52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 53 of 61\nthink that Defendants’ wrongful withholding of the Endowment’s funds will persist and recur \nabsent judicial relief. \n177.  Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n178.  This Court should hold unlawful, enjoin, and set aside Defendants’ unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds. \nCOUNT SEVEN \nAppropriations Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 \n(Against Defendants Marco Rubio, Russell Vought, Scott Bessent, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., \nand Melissa Bruce) \n179.  The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n180.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 \n(2010). \n181.  The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides: “No Money shall be \ndrawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law[.]”  U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 9, cl. 7.  The Clause protects Congress’s “exclusive power over the federal purse.”  U.S. \nDep’t of Navy v. Fed. Lab. Rels. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Rochester \nPure Waters Dist. v. EPA, 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).  The Executive Branch does not \nhave constitutional authority to override or disregard Congress’s appropriations.  In re Aiken \nCnty., 725 F.3d 255, 260–61 (D.C. Cir. 2013).   \n  53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 54 of 61\n182.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally-\nappropriated funds infringes Congress’s exclusive power over the federal purse.  That exclusive \npower is conferred and protected in part by the Appropriations Clause, and the Executive has no \nconstitutional authority to countermand it. \n183.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \nEndowment.  In light of the current withholding of the Endowment’s funding and the broader \nExecutive Branch efforts to interfere with the Endowment’s mission, there is every reason to \nthink that Defendants’ wrongful withholding of the Endowment’s funds will persist and recur \nabsent judicial relief. \n184.  Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n185.  This Court should hold unlawful, enjoin, and set aside Defendants’ unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds. \n  54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 55 of 61\nCOUNT EIGHT \nSpending Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 \n(Against Defendants Marco Rubio, Russell Vought, Scott Bessent, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., \nand Melissa Bruce) \n186.  The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n187.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 \n(2010). \n188.  The Spending Clause of the Constitution provides:  “The Congress shall have \nPower To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \nthe common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and \nExcises shall be uniform throughout the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The \nSpending Clause vests the power of the purse, including the power to attach conditions to the \nexpenditure of federal funds, exclusively with Congress. \n189.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally-\nappropriated funds infringes Congress’s exclusive power over the federal purse.  That exclusive \npower is conferred and protected in part by the Spending Clause, and the Executive has no \nconstitutional authority to countermand it. \n190.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \n  55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 56 of 61\nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \nEndowment.  In light of the current withholding of the Endowment’s funding and the broader \nExecutive Branch efforts to interfere with the Endowment’s mission, there is every reason to \nthink that Defendants’ wrongful withholding of the Endowment’s funds will persist and recur \nabsent judicial relief. \n191.  Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n192.  This Court should hold unlawful, enjoin, and set aside Defendants’ unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds. \nCOUNT NINE \nTake Care Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3 \n(Against Defendants Marco Rubio, Russell Vought, Scott Bessent, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., \nand Melissa Bruce) \n193.  The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n194.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 \n(2010). \n195.  Under the Constitution, the executive power vested in the President and, by \nextension, all subordinate officers to whom he may delegate executive functions, includes the \nduty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.   \n196.  The Take Care Clause forbids the Executive Branch from refusing to faithfully \nexecute the laws of the United States. \n  56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 57 of 61\n197.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally \nappropriated funds violates the Take Care Clause.  \n198.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \nEndowment.

Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n200.  This Court should hold unlawful, enjoin, and set aside Defendants’ unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds. \nCOUNT TEN \nViolation of the Separation of Powers  \n(Against Defendants Marco Rubio, Russell Vought, Scott Bessent, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., \nand Melissa Bruce) \n201.  The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n  57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 58 of 61\n202.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 \n(2010). \n203.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally \nappropriated funds exceeds the executive branch’s constitutional authority and impermissibly \nusurps the legislative power, in violation of the Separation of Powers.  See U.S. Const. art. II, \n§ 3; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7; U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1; U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2. \n204.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \nEndowment.

Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n206.

The Endowment realleges and incorporates by reference all prior and subsequent \nparagraphs. \n208.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin ultra vires executive conduct.  \nSee Fed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Com., 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \n209.  No statute, constitutional provision, or other source of law authorizes Defendants \nto impound the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds.  To the contrary, the statutory \nscheme creates a mandatory duty for Defendants to apportion, obligate, disburse, and otherwise \nmake available the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds.  22 U.S.C. § 4412(a); \nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47 (2024); 31 U.S.C. §§ 1512, 3325.   \n210.  Defendants’ unlawful impoundment of the Endowment’s congressionally \nappropriated funds is ultra vires. \n211.  Judicial relief is warranted to ensure that Defendants do not unlawfully withhold \nthe Endowment’s appropriations.  Defendants are currently unlawfully withholding the \nEndowment’s appropriations by refusing to apportion and obligate the funds that Congress \nspecifically appropriated for obligation to the Endowment.  In addition, prior to the filing of the \nComplaint, ECF No. 1, Defendants withheld the Endowment’s appropriations by refusing to \nobligate and disburse the funds that Congress specifically appropriated for obligation to the \nEndowment.  In light of the current withholding of the Endowment’s funding and the broader \nExecutive Branch efforts to interfere with the Endowment’s mission, there is every reason to \nthink that Defendants’ wrongful withholding of the Endowment’s funds will persist and recur \nabsent judicial relief. \n  59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 60 of 61\n212.  Absent relief from this Court, the Endowment will face irreparable harm, \nincluding to its ability to fulfill its mission and to its reputation as a reliable source of funding for \ndemocracy and freedom around the world. \n213.  This Court should hold unlawful, enjoin, and set aside Defendants’ unlawful \nimpoundment of the Endowment’s appropriated funds. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  Wherefore, the Endowment requests judgment in its favor against Defendants as follows: \n \nA.  Order Defendants to cease (1) their unlawful refusal to disburse and otherwise \nmake available the Endowment’s obligated funds and (2) their unlawful refusal to apportion and \nobligate the remainder of the Endowment’s annual appropriation; \nB.  Declare unlawful and set aside the Executive Branch’s impoundment of the \nEndowment’s congressionally appropriated funds as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B), and in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C);  \nC.  Issue a preliminary injunction barring Defendants from impounding the \nEndowment’s congressionally appropriated funds;  \nD.  Order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 24 hours of entry of \na preliminary injunction, and at regular intervals thereafter, confirming the apportionment, \nobligation, and regular disbursement of the Endowment’s appropriated funds and reporting all \nsteps that Defendants have taken to comply with the Court’s preliminary injunction; \nE.  Issue a permanent injunction barring Defendants from impounding the \nEndowment’s congressionally appropriated funds; \n  60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00648-DLF     Document 35     Filed 06/30/25     Page 61 of 61\nF.
