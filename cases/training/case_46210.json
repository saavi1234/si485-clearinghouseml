No later than ten (10) days from this date of this Order, the parties shall meet and confer to more narrowly tailor Defendants' remaining discovery requests to Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff shall also continue to voluntarily produce information to Defendants, to which it has agreed. (Rec. doc. 37 at 17). With regard to the Requests for Admission, Plaintiff shall respond to them no later than fourteen (14) days from the date of this Order. Said requests are not overly burdensome to Plaintiff. In addition, the Court finds that the depositions of Jeffrey Harrington, Dr. John Vandenburg, Dr. Ila Cote, and Dr. Helen Suh are proportional to any opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction. Defendants may depose these four individuals in accordance with strict compliance to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. No later than ten (10) days from the date of this Order, Plaintiff and Defendants shall meet and confer to schedule a mutually-agreeable date and time for these four depositions and to discuss whether Plaintiff need depose any of Defendants' experts. Signed by Magistrate Judge Michael North on 4/24/23. (cg) (Entered: 04/24/2023)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC&rsquo;s (Denka&rsquo;s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene&mdash;a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.</p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. ​Plaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court&rsquo;s order.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. ​</p>\r\n<p>In response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff&rsquo;s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was &ldquo;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law&rdquo; in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an &ldquo;imminent and substantial endangerment&rdquo; warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled &ldquo;New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I &amp; II Polymers and Resins Industry&rdquo; (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.</p>\r\n<p>The same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.</p>\r\n<p>On September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 10, 2025 the court granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1743371953208062&amp;usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps &lsquo;dismantle radical DEI programs&rsquo;</a>).

This is a civil action alleging that carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from\nDefendant Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC’s (“Denka’s”) neoprene manufacturing \noperations at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana (the \n“Facility”) present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare.  The \nFacility’s address is in LaPlace, Louisiana, but its chloroprene emissions also travel into other \nnearby communities in the Parish, such as Reserve and Edgard, Louisiana.  People living in these \ncommunities are being exposed to an unacceptably high risk of developing certain cancers \nbecause of Denka’s chloroprene emissions.  The United States seeks injunctive relief under \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 2 of 22\nClean Air Act Section 303, 42 U.S.C. § 7603, requiring that Denka immediately reduce its \nchloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer \nrisks within the communities surrounding the Facility. \n2.  This civil action also seeks relief from DuPont Specialty Products USA, LLC \n(“DuPont Specialty Products”) based on Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  \n§ 1651.  DuPont Specialty Products owns the land at the Pontchartrain Works Site on which \nDenka’s neoprene manufacturing operations are located.  DuPont Specialty Products is Denka’s \nlandlord and leases that land on which the neoprene manufacturing operations are located to \nDenka pursuant to a “Ground Lease.”  Accordingly, Denka may need DuPont Specialty \nProducts’ permission or cooperation to comply with the Court’s orders in this matter.  The \nGround Lease requires Denka to obtain DuPont Specialty Products’ consent before undertaking \ncertain construction activities or equipment modifications involving the neoprene manufacturing \noperations. \n3.  Chloroprene is a liquid raw material that is used to produce neoprene.  It is \ncolorless, flammable, and readily evaporates at room temperature.  Chloroprene is produced \nusing toxic substances, including 1,3-butadiene and chlorine.  And it is, itself, defined by the \nClean Air Act as a hazardous air pollutant.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(1). \n4.  Chloroprene is hazardous, in part, because it is a likely human carcinogen.  \nBreathing chloroprene increases the risk of developing cancers, such as lung and liver cancer, \nover the course of a lifetime.  Chloroprene acts via a mutagenic “mode of action,” meaning that \nwhen a person breathes chloroprene, it causes mutations in the body’s cells.  These mutations \nincrease the likelihood that a person who breathes chloroprene will develop certain cancers over \nthe course of their lifetime. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 3 of 22\n5.  Infants and children younger than 16 are likely to be especially susceptible to \nchloroprene’s cancer-causing effects.  Chloroprene exposure during a person’s early years is \ntherefore particularly significant to their lifetime risk of developing cancer. \n6.  The concentrations of airborne chloroprene in the communities surrounding the \nFacility are exposing thousands of people living there, including children younger than 16, to \nlifetime cancer risks that are multiples higher than what is typically considered acceptable by \nseveral United States regulatory agencies charged with protecting human health.  And the only \nsource of chloroprene emissions in St. John the Baptist Parish is Denka’s neoprene \nmanufacturing operations at the Facility. \n7.  A 1-in-10,000 cancer risk is a generally accepted threshold for demarcating the \nceiling for acceptable excess cancer risk, and it is a benchmark for the level of cancer risk that is \nconsidered important to address in most instances by regulatory agencies.  For example, the \nEPA’s policy for setting national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants, like \nchloroprene, that are emitted by industrial source categories uses a presumptive 1-in-10,000 \nupper threshold for acceptable excess lifetime cancer risk.  See 54 Fed. Reg. 38,044, 38,045 \n(Sept. 14, 1989) (the EPA’s “1989 Residual Risk Policy”).  Congress subsequently endorsed this \npolicy in amendments to the Clean Air Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(2)(B).  Other EPA non-air \nprograms also rely on a 1-in-10,000 excess cancer risk as a presumptive risk management \nstandard.  See 40 C.F.R. § 300.430(e)(2)(i)(A)(2) (explaining Superfund remedial action cleanup \ngoals).  And other federal agencies, like the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth (“NIOSH”), also use a 1-in-10,000 excess cancer risk as a threshold for taking action to \naddress cancer risk.  See Current Intelligence Bulletin 68 - NIOSH Chemical Carcinogen Policy \n(July 2017). \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 4 of 22\n8.  The EPA estimates that breathing chloroprene at concentrations averaging 0.2 \nmicrograms of chloroprene per cubic meter (0.2 µg/m3) over a 70-year lifetime increases a \nperson’s risk of developing cancer by 1-in-10,000.  And the greater the average chloroprene \nconcentration that a person is exposed to, the faster their chloroprene related cancer risk \naccumulates.  As people breathe chloroprene at long-term average concentrations greater than \n0.2 µg/m3, their risk of developing cancer as a result of that exposure will reach and exceed 1-in-\n10,000 sooner than 70 years. \n9.  Average concentrations of airborne chloroprene near the Facility have been \nconsistently greater than 0.2 µg/m3 since at least 2016, and likely for years before then.  Two sets \nof air monitoring stations were installed in 2016 at several locations near the Facility – one set \nwas installed by the EPA, the other by Denka.  Each set of air monitors measured chloroprene \nconcentrations in the ambient air.  Air monitors were installed in residential neighborhoods near \nthe Facility and near schools close to the Facility, including the Fifth Ward Elementary School \nand East St. John High School.   \n10.  Both sets of air monitors detected chloroprene at average concentrations that were \nconsistently much greater than 0.2 µg/m3.  The air monitors located in the residential \nneighborhoods just west of the Facility detected some of the highest chloroprene levels.   \n11.  At the average chloroprene concentrations currently being detected, people are \nbeing exposed to risks of developing chloroprene-related cancers that are as much as an order of \nmagnitude greater than multiple federal agencies’ presumptive benchmark for acceptable excess \nlifetime cancer risk.  At the average chloroprene concentrations currently being detected, people \nexposed to these concentrations will reach unacceptably high cancer risks much sooner than over \na 70-year lifetime.  For example, infants born today in the communities surrounding the Facility \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 5 of 22\nwho are exposed to the highest measured levels of chloroprene from Denka’s neoprene \nmanufacturing operations will exceed an estimated lifetime of acceptable excess cancer risk \nwithin approximately their first two years of life. \n12.  Many people living near Denka’s neoprene manufacturing operations already \nhave been exposed to unacceptably high excess cancer risks.  The neoprene manufacturing \noperations at the Pontchartrain Works Site have existed for decades, and people have lived there \njust as long.  Those people have been breathing the air there for decades, and the Facility \nhistorically emitted even higher levels of chloroprene than it does today.  Those individuals’ \ncancer risk increases every day they continue to breathe Denka’s chloroprene emissions.   \n13.  The increased cancer risk that the communities near the Facility are currently \nbeing exposed to because of Denka’s chloroprene emissions presents an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment to public health and welfare.  The endangerment is imminent because \nDenka emits chloroprene at levels that are producing unacceptably high risks of cancer to the \npeople, including children, that are regularly exposed to the Facility’s emissions.  Hundreds of \nchildren attend school near the Facility and currently breathe the air there.  Many of them likely \nalso live in the neighborhoods surrounding the Facility. \n14.  The endangerment is substantial because Denka’s emissions of chloroprene cause \nambient levels of chloroprene in nearby communities to be many times greater than the generally \naccepted threshold for demarcating unacceptably high cancer risks, and because children living \nin these communities and attending the schools close to the Facility are likely to be especially \nsusceptible to the cancer risks posed by chloroprene.  Denka’s chloroprene emissions are the \ncause of this endangerment. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 6 of 22\n15.  The United States seeks injunctive relief, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7603, to stop \nDenka from emitting chloroprene at levels that present an imminent and substantial \nendangerment to public health and welfare in the communities surrounding the Facility. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 7603, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345. \n17.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Denka.  Denka is incorporated in the \nState of Louisiana and does business here, including via its neoprene manufacturing operations at \nthe Facility, which is located in St. John the Baptist Parish at 586 Highway 44, LaPlace, \nLouisiana, 70068. \n18.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over DuPont Specialty Products.  DuPont \nSpecialty Products conducts business in LaPlace, Louisiana at the Facility. \n19.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7603, and 28 U.S.C.  \n§ 1391(b) and (c).  Denka does business in this District and the chloroprene emissions from its \nneoprene manufacturing operations are occurring in this District. \nNOTICE \n20.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7603, the United States has provided notice of the \ncommencement of this action to, and has consulted with representatives of, the Louisiana \nDepartment of Environmental Quality (“Louisiana DEQ”) to attempt to confirm the accuracy of \nthe information upon which the United States is basing this action.  The United States has \nprovided notice of the commencement of this civil action to the Louisiana DEQ. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 7 of 22\nPARTIES \n21.  Plaintiff, the United States of America, is acting by authority of the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States and through the undersigned attorneys, on behalf of the \nAdministrator of the EPA.  Authority to bring this action is vested in the Attorney General of the \nUnited States by 42 U.S.C. § 7605, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 516 and 519. \n22.  Denka is a privately owned limited liability company formed under the laws of \nthe State of Delaware, headquartered in LaPlace, Louisiana, and authorized to do business in the \nState of Louisiana.  Denka is a joint venture between majority owner Denka Company Limited \nand minority owner Mitsui & Co. Ltd., both of which are Japanese companies.  Denka is the \ncurrent owner and operator, as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(9), of the neoprene manufacturing \noperations at the Facility.  At all times relevant to the Complaint, Denka has been a corporate \nentity and therefore a “person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. §§ 7602(e) and 7603. \n23.  Formed in 2018, DuPont Specialty Products is a privately owned limited liability \ncompany that is headquartered in Delaware and maintains its principal place of business in \nDelaware.  At all times relevant to the Complaint, DuPont Specialty Products has been a \ncorporate entity and therefore a “person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. §§ 7602(e) and 7603. \n24.  Subject to a reasonable opportunity for investigation and discovery, DuPont \nSpecialty Products owns the land upon which the Facility is located.  Subject to a reasonable \nopportunity for investigation and discovery, DuPont Specialty Products leases to Denka the land \nupon which the neoprene manufacturing operations are located.  The Ground Lease documents \nthis lessor/lessee relationship.  The Ground Lease has an effective date of approximately October \n30, 2015 and lasts for a 99-year term. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 8 of 22\n25.  The Ground Lease retains certain rights for DuPont Specialty Products (either \ndirectly or as an assignee) that can affect Denka’s neoprene manufacturing operations.  Under \nthe Ground Lease, DuPont Specialty Products (either directly or as an assignee) retains rights \nover certain assets at the Facility.  These assets include fixtures, improvements, and easements, \nsuch as: certain of the well injection pumps, carbon beds, wastewater sampling equipment, tanks, \nprocess and service lines, sewer lines, electrical equipment, and rights-of-way on certain \nroadways.  The Ground Lease also requires Denka to obtain DuPont Specialty Products’ consent \nbefore undertaking certain construction activities or equipment modifications involving the \nneoprene manufacturing operations. \n26.  In order for complete relief to be afforded in this matter, the Court may need to \ninvolve DuPont Specialty Products.  DuPont Specialty Products maintains rights or interests \nunder the Ground Lease and as the owner of the land upon which Denka’s neoprene \nmanufacturing operations are located.  These rights and interests may be impacted in this matter \nbecause the relief that the United States seeks from Denka may, for example, require onsite \nconstruction or other work that requires DuPont Specialty Products’ consent under the Ground \nLease.  DuPont Specialty Products is therefore a required party pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) \nand the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. \nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \nDenka’s Neoprene Manufacturing Operations  \n27.  Neoprene (a.k.a. “chloroprene rubber” or “polychloroprene”) is a flexible, \nsynthetic rubber used to produce common goods like wetsuits, beverage cozies, orthopedic \nbraces, and automotive belts and hoses.  Denka began manufacturing neoprene at the Facility on \napproximately November 1, 2015.  Denka purchased the neoprene manufacturing operations at \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 9 of 22\nthe Facility in 2014 from E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company.  E.I. DuPont de Nemours and \nCompany (or a predecessor-in-interest) owned and operated the original neoprene manufacturing \noperations at the Facility from about 1968 until the sale to Denka. \n28.  Since about 2008, neoprene has been manufactured at only one place in the \nUnited States: the Facility.  According to the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database, Denka’s \nmanufacturing operations at the Facility are the sole source of chloroprene emissions in St. John \nthe Baptist Parish, Louisiana. \n29.  Denka’s neoprene manufacturing operations consist primarily of three chemical \nmanufacturing process units: the Chloroprene Unit, the Neoprene Unit, and the HCl Recovery \nUnit.  Each of these three units emits chloroprene as well as other hazardous air pollutants. \n30.  At all times relevant to the Complaint, chloroprene has been an “air pollutant” \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 7602(g).  At all times relevant to the Complaint, chloroprene \nhas also been defined as a “hazardous air pollutant” by 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(1).  The Clean Air \nAct classifies hazardous air pollutants as substances that, through inhalation or other exposure \npathways, present or may present a threat of adverse effects to human health or the environment.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(2). \n31.  Chloroprene is routinely emitted into the air at various stages of Denka’s \nneoprene manufacturing operations.  Chloroprene is emitted through vents from the \nmanufacturing operations that discharge directly to the atmosphere.  Chloroprene is emitted \nwhen tanks and other process vessels are opened, during both normal operations and \nmaintenance work.  Chloroprene is also emitted through more diffuse (“fugitive”) sources, like \nequipment leaks and evaporative emissions from wastewater generated during neoprene \nmanufacturing.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 10 of 22\n32.  For example, Denka uses a series of three open-to-the-air, brick-lined pits \n(collectively called the “Outside Brine Pit”) to treat reactive chloroprene-containing sludge, \nwastewater, and solid waste material generated by the neoprene manufacturing process.  These \nwastes, which are chemically reactive and volatilize high levels of chloroprene into the air, are \nskimmed from strainers at the polymerization kettles and poured into open, wheeled bins several \ntimes per day.  Liquid wastewater is hosed into open grated trenches that eventually empty into \nthe Outside Brine Pit.  The wastes are wheeled in the open bins to the Outside Brine Pit.  There, \nemployees dump the wastes into the Outside Brine Pit where they are left to finish their chemical \nreactions.  By design, these wastes volatilize chloroprene to the open air before they are collected \nfor off-site disposal. \n33.  Denka’s chloroprene emissions drift beyond the Facility’s property line and into \nthe ambient air of the surrounding communities in LaPlace, Reserve, and Edgard, Louisiana.  \nThousands of people, including children, who live, work, and go to school in these communities \nbreathe that air. \n34.  Pursuant to a January 6, 2017 Administrative Order on Consent issued by the \nLouisiana DEQ, Denka agreed to reduce chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing \noperations.  Denka upgraded equipment and installed emission control devices, including a \nRegenerative Thermal Oxidizer which became fully operational in March of 2018.  These actions \nreduced the Facility’s chloroprene emissions.   \n35.  Despite these emission reductions, Denka continues to emit approximately 18 \ntons of chloroprene each year.  And despite Denka’s emission reductions, chloroprene \nconcentrations in the communities surrounding the Facility have averaged between \napproximately 0.4 and 2.9 µg/m3 since April 2018, depending on the monitoring location – all \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 11 of 22\nsignificantly exceeding 0.2 µg/m3.  Without further emission reductions, Denka’s chloroprene \nemissions will continue to cause average chloroprene levels to exceed 0.2 µg/m3 in the \ncommunities surrounding the Facility. \nThe Communities Living Near the Facility \n36.  According to United States census data, between approximately 15,000 to 17,000 \npeople live within two-and-a-half miles of Denka’s Facility.  Over 20% of that population \n(roughly 3,000-4,000) is under the age of 18.  Of those 3,000-4,000 young people, approximately \n800-1,000 are young children under the age of 5.  \n37.  The Fifth Ward Elementary School, which is attended by more than 300 children, \nis located about half-a-mile from the center of Denka’s Facility.  Approximately 1,200 students \nare enrolled at East St. John High School, which is roughly a mile-and-a-half north of Denka’s \nneoprene manufacturing operations. \nChloroprene’s Carcinogenic Effects  \n38.  Chloroprene is a likely human carcinogen that acts via a mutagenic mode of \naction. \n39.  Infants and children are more susceptible than adults to the cancer risks posed by \nmutagens like chloroprene.  This is because more rapid cell division during early life results in \nless time for the body to repair DNA mutations before the damaged cells replicate.  The more \nrapid replication of mutated cells increases the risk of developing cancer.  Infants and children \nare also more susceptible to chloroprene’s cancer-causing risks because, for physiological \nreasons, they will likely have higher and more persistent blood concentrations of chloroprene or \nits metabolites than adults exposed to the same air concentrations of chloroprene. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 12 of 22\n40.  The EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (“IRIS”) program identifies and \ncharacterizes the health hazards of chemicals found in the environment.  The EPA develops IRIS \nassessments to characterize the risks to human health posed by specific environmental hazards.  \nIRIS assessments are conducted by experts in various scientific disciplines such as toxicology, \nepidemiology, and pharmacokinetics.  Developing an IRIS assessment for a particular chemical \ninvolves identifying health hazards associated with human exposure to that chemical, then \nquantifying the relationship between exposure to the chemical and the related health hazards to \narrive at an estimate of cancer potency. \n41.  In 2010, the EPA IRIS program published its peer-reviewed assessment of \nchloroprene (the “2010 IRIS Assessment”).  In the 2010 IRIS Assessment, the EPA concluded \nthat chloroprene is “likely to be carcinogenic to humans” and determined that it acts through a \nmutagenic mode of action.  The 2010 IRIS Assessment also provided a quantitative estimate of \ncarcinogenic risk from breathing (a.k.a. “inhalation exposure”) chloroprene.  The 2010 IRIS \nAssessment was based on a comprehensive review of the available evidence on chloroprene \ntoxicity, including animal toxicology data, evidence of chloroprene’s mutagenic properties, and \nhuman epidemiological data.  The 2010 IRIS Assessment was subject to a rigorous review \nprocess within the EPA, by other federal agencies and White House offices, and the public.  The \nconclusions of the 2010 IRIS Assessment were subsequently confirmed by an independent \nexternal peer review panel.   \n42.  In the 2010 IRIS Assessment, the EPA also quantified the cancer risks associated \nwith long-term chronic inhalation exposure to chloroprene.  Breathing is the primary pathway by \nwhich people living near the Facility are exposed to chloroprene.  The EPA’s 2010 IRIS \nAssessment establishes 0.2 µg/m3 as the average concentration of chloroprene that a person may \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 13 of 22\nbreathe over a 70-year lifetime without being expected to exceed a 1-in-10,000 risk of \ncontracting chloroprene-linked cancers.  1.2 µg/m3 is the average chloroprene concentration a \nchild may regularly breathe from birth to their second birthday without being expected to exceed \na 1-in-10,000 lifetime risk of contracting chloroprene related cancers. \nDenka Consistently Emits Chloroprene at Levels That Cause Unacceptably High Cancer \nRisk in the Surrounding Communities \n \n43.  The EPA has determined that Denka’s chloroprene emissions are presenting an \nimminent and substantial endangerment because the average chloroprene concentrations in the \nambient air near the Facility from the period of April 2018 through January 2023 at Denka’s \nmonitoring stations are 2.89, 2.21, 1.26, 1.06 and 0.89 µg/m3 for the five closest monitors to the \nFacility, and 0.41 µg/m3 for the monitor located approximately two-and-a-half miles away in \nEdgard, Louisiana.  Even the lowest measured average value for the five closest monitors is \nmore than four times greater than 0.2 µg/m3, and the highest average is more than 14 times \nhigher.  In the aggregate, the thousands of people breathing this air are incurring a significantly \nhigher cancer risk than would be typically allowed, and they are being exposed to a much greater \ncancer risk from Denka’s air pollution than the majority of United States residents face. \n44.  In 2016, the EPA and Denka both began monitoring chloroprene concentrations in \nthe air around the Facility.  This air monitoring was intended to better understand the amount of \nchloroprene that people living near the Facility were exposed to and to better characterize the \nassociated health risks. \n45.  The air monitoring data from both monitoring systems consistently show average \nairborne chloroprene concentrations in the communities surrounding Denka’s neoprene \nmanufacturing operations that are multiples greater than 0.2 µg/m3.  People living in the \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 14 of 22\nresidential area closest to the Facility are currently exposed to average levels of chloroprene that \nare more than 14 times greater than 0.2 µg/m3. \nDenka’s Air Monitoring Shows Chloroprene Levels that Indicate Excessive Cancer Risk \n46.  Beginning in August 2016, Denka commenced regular air sampling at several \nlocations near the Facility.  Samples are taken roughly once every three to six days, and measure \naverage chloroprene concentrations over a 24-hour period.  Denka’s monitors are identified as: \na.  The “Entergy” monitor, located at or near the Entergy Substation, \n \nb.  The “Railroad” monitor, located at or near the intersection of Highway 44 \nand the Illinois Central Railroad tracks, \n \nc.  The “Western” monitor, located at or near the Western Edge of the \nFacility, \n \nd.  The “Levee” monitor, located at or near the Mississippi River Levee on \nthe south side of the Facility, \n \ne.  The “Ochsner Hospital” monitor located at or near the Ochsner Hospital, \nand \n \nf.  The “Edgard” monitor, located at or near the St. John the Baptist Parish \nCourthouse in Edgard. \n \n47.  The Western monitor is located near a residential neighborhood that begins only \nabout 50 feet from the Facility’s western property line.  The Fifth Ward Elementary School is \napproximately 1,000 feet from the Western monitor.  The Railroad monitor is located near a \nresidential area and the closest home sits approximately 500 feet from the monitor.  The Levee \nmonitor is located about 2,000 feet from the nearest home.  The Edgard monitor is located \napproximately two-and-a-half miles southwest of the Facility, across the Mississippi River.  The \nEntergy, Ochsner Hospital, and Railroad monitors are respectively located approximately one \nmile north, northeast, and east of the Facility. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 15 of 22\n48.  Air monitoring data collected at each of Denka’s monitoring sites since April \n2018 – reflecting air quality after the Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer commenced stable \noperations – shows that the average chloroprene concentration across all six Denka sampling \nsites from April 2018 through January 2023 was approximately 1.46 µg/m3— more than 7 times \nhigher than 0.2 µg/m3.  The worst of Denka’s sampling locations (the Western monitor, which is \nclosest to the residential neighborhood west of the Facility) showed average concentrations of \n2.89 µg/m3, more than 14 times higher than 0.2 µg/m3.  See Table 1 below: \nTable 1: Denka Air Monitoring Results, April 2018 – January 2023 \nAverage Monitored Chloroprene \nDenka Monitoring Site  Concentration from \nApril 2018 – January 2023 \nWestern  2.89 µg/m3 \nLevee  2.21 µg/m3 \nRailroad  1.26 µg/m3 \nOchsner Hospital  1.06 µg/m3 \nEntergy  0.89 µg/m3 \nEdgard  0.41 µg/m3 \nAverage Monitored Chloroprene \nConcentration Across All Denka \n1.46 µg/m3 \nMonitoring Sites from  \nApril 2018 – January 2023 \n \n49.  In January 2022, Denka deployed 18 diffusion tube air monitors – a different type \nof monitor than the six 24-hour canisters – around the Facility’s fenceline.  Three additional \ndiffusion tube monitors were installed later that year (for a total of 21 diffusion tube monitors).  \nThese new monitors measure the ambient air concentration of chloroprene over a two-week \nsampling period.  Consistent with the results of the EPA’s and Denka’s 24-hour air sampling, \nthrough late December 2022, 19 of 21 diffusion tube sampling locations are measuring average \nchloroprene concentrations greater than 0.2 µg/m3.  And two-week average concentrations of \nchloroprene significantly greater than 0.2 µg/m3 continue to occur near residential areas. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 16 of 22\nEPA’s Air Monitoring Showed Chloroprene Levels that Indicate Excessive Cancer Risk \n \n50.  From May 2016 through September 2020, the EPA also regularly collected \n24-hour air samples from six locations near the Facility.  The EPA’s monitoring sites, which \nwere near, but not exactly where Denka’s monitors are located, were identified as: \na.  The “Acorn and Highway 44” monitor, located at or near the intersection \nof Acorn Street and Highway 44, \n \nb.  The “Levee” monitor, located at or near the Mississippi River Levee on \nthe south side of the Facility, \n \nc.  The “Fifth Ward Elementary School” monitor, located at or near the Fifth \nWard Elementary School, \n \nd.  The “Ochsner Hospital” monitor located at or near Ochsner Hospital,  \n \ne.  The “Chad Baker” monitor, located at or near a residence on Chad Baker \nStreet, and \n \nf.  The “East St. John High School” monitor located at or near East St. John \nHigh School. \n \n51.  Air monitoring data collected at each of the EPA’s monitoring sites, starting in \nApril 2018, show that the average chloroprene concentration across all the EPA’s sampling sites \nfrom April 2018 through September 2020 was 1.43 µg/m3—7 times higher than 0.2 µg/m3.  The \nworst of EPA’s sampling locations (the Chad Baker site, in the residential neighborhood west of \nthe Facility) showed average concentrations of 2.22 µg/m3, more than 11 times higher than \n0.2 µg/m3.  See Table 2 below: \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 17 of 22\nTable 2: EPA Air Monitoring Results, April 2018 – September 2020 \nAverage Monitored Chloroprene \nEPA Monitoring Site  Concentration from April 2018 – \nSeptember 2020 \nChad Baker  2.22 µg/m3 \nLevee  1.90 µg/m3 \nFifth Ward Elementary School  1.73 µg/m3 \nAcorn and Hwy 44  1.17 µg/m3 \nOchsner Hospital  1.15 µg/m3 \nEast St. John High School  0.44 µg/m3 \nAverage Monitored Chloroprene \nConcentration Across All EPA \n1.43 µg/m3 \nMonitoring Sites from  \nApril 2018 – September 2020 \n \nInfants and Young Children Will Exceed Unacceptable Lifetime Cancer Risk Levels  \nMuch More Quickly Than Adults \n \n52.  Current chloroprene concentrations near the Facility present a risk that is \nespecially grave for infants and children under the age of 16.  For example, infants and children \nwho begin consistently breathing chloroprene starting in infancy at the average concentrations \nmeasured near the Western and Chad Baker air monitors (listed in Tables 1 and 2) will surpass \ntheir lifetime 1-in-10,000 excess cancer risk within approximately two years after their exposure \nbegins (68 years sooner than the 70-year period over which lifetime excess cancer risks are \ndetermined).  Adolescents and adults who consistently breathe Denka’s current chloroprene \nemissions will similarly surpass a 1-in-10,000 excess cancer risk in far less time than the 70-year \ntimeframe that the EPA uses to identify “lifetime” cancer risks.   \nThe Cancer Risks from the Facility’s Chloroprene Emissions are Cumulative \n \n53.  Chloroprene has been released into the environment for decades as a result of \nneoprene manufacturing operations at the Pontchartrain Works Site.  Historical sampling, \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 18 of 22\nemission data, and air modeling show that, before April 2018 and during the decades when the \nFacility was owned and operated by E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company (and its predecessors \nin interest), people living near the Facility were exposed to chloroprene at average concentrations \nmultiples higher than current levels.  Until recently, the neoprene manufacturing operations often \nemitted more than one hundred tons of chloroprene each year. \n54.  Residents in communities surrounding the Facility have been and continue to be \nchronically exposed to unacceptably high levels of chloroprene and the consequent cancer risk.   \nClean Air Act Section 303 \n55.  Congress enacted the Clean Air Act “to protect and enhance the quality of the \nNation’s air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity \nof its population.”  42 U.S.C. § 7401(b)(1). \n56.  Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7603, provides: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Administrator, upon \nreceipt of evidence that a pollution source or combination of sources (including \nmoving sources) is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to \npublic health or welfare, or the environment, may bring suit on behalf of the \nUnited States in the appropriate United States district court to immediately \nrestrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged pollution to stop the \nemission of air pollutants causing or contributing to such pollution or to take such \nother action as may be necessary. \n \n57.  The increased cancer risks to people living near Denka’s neoprene manufacturing \noperations that are being caused by long-term exposure to Denka’s chloroprene emissions \nrepresent an “endangerment to public health [and] welfare” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 7603.  The Clean Air Act explains that effects on welfare include, but are not limited to, harm \nto “personal comfort and well-being, whether caused by transformation, conversion, or \ncombination with other air pollutants.”  42 U.S.C. § 7602(h). \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 19 of 22\n58.  The endangerment posed by Denka’s chloroprene emissions is “imminent” in that \nthe conditions giving rise to it – the currently measured average concentrations of airborne \nchloroprene – are present now.  The endangerment is also “substantial” given the proximity of \nthe surrounding communities to Denka’s chloroprene emissions, the number and age distribution \nof the exposed population, the magnitude of Denka’s current chloroprene emissions and the \ncommunities’ ongoing exposure to them, and the consequent greater than 1-in-10,000 lifetime \nexcess cancer risk.  Based on these circumstances, Denka’s current chloroprene emissions \nrepresent a serious threat of harm to public health and welfare.   \n59.  The serious threats to public health and welfare caused by Denka’s chloroprene \nemissions will continue until Denka significantly reduces its emissions.  Even after Denka’s \nmore recent efforts to reduce its chloroprene emissions, chloroprene concentrations in the \nambient air around the Facility still average well above 0.2 µg/m3.  If Denka continues to emit \nchloroprene at its current levels, chloroprene concentrations in the communities surrounding the \nFacility will continue to present an imminent and substantial endangerment. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Injunctive Relief under 42 U.S.C. § 7603) \n \n60.  Paragraphs 1 through 59 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n61.  At all times relevant to the Complaint, Denka’s neoprene manufacturing \noperations at the Pontchartrain Works Site have been a “pollution source” within the meaning of \n42 U.S.C. § 7603.  The Chloroprene Unit, Neoprene Unit, and HCl Recovery Unit constitute a \n“combination of sources” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 7603. \n62.  Emissions of chloroprene from Denka’s neoprene manufacturing operations are \n“pollution” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 7603. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 20 of 22\n63.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, Denka has caused and continues to cause \nthe observed concentrations of chloroprene in the air in, around, and outside of the Facility’s \nproperty line at the air monitoring locations listed in Tables 1 and 2. \n64.  Based on the information described in Paragraphs 3 - 54, the EPA has received \nevidence that the current concentrations of chloroprene in the air in and around the Facility \npresent an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare, including but not \nlimited to unacceptably high lifetime excess cancer risks to residents of LaPlace and Reserve, \nLouisiana. \n65.  Based on the terms of the Ground Lease, Denka may need permission or \ncooperation from DuPont Specialty Products in order to take the necessary actions to abate the \nimminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions. \n66.  Any delay or refusal by DuPont Specialty Products to authorize Denka under the \nGround Lease to comply with the requirements of any order of this Court will contribute to the \nemission of air pollutants within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. §§ 7602(g) and 7603. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff the United States of America respectfully requests that the Court \nprovide the following relief: \n1.  Order Denka to immediately take all necessary measures to eliminate the \nimminent and substantial endangerment posed by chloroprene emissions from the Facility;  \n2.  Order Denka to take all other actions as may be necessary to address and mitigate \nthe harm to public health and welfare that Denka’s chloroprene emissions have caused; \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 21 of 22\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 22 of 22\nJUSTIN LANNEN \nAssistant Regional Counsel \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6 \n1201 Elm Street, Suite 500 (ORCEA) \nDallas, TX 75270 \n22 \n ",

The Plaintiff asserts that it has the right to do so pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (“All Writs Act”). However, as set \nforth fully below, these provisions do not provide authority for the relief requested because: (a) \nthe Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the hypothetical future dispute proposed by the \nPlaintiff’s pleading and (b) the Plaintiff’s Complaint substantively fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \nThe Plaintiff seeks this extraordinary remedy against DuPont Specialty Products USA, \nLLC (“Specialty”) simply because Specialty is the lessor of the piece of property upon which the \nplant at issue in this litigation is built. The Plaintiff is attempting to force Specialty to have to \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 2 of 18\nparticipate as a party to this highly involved and expensive litigation simply because the Plaintiff \nasserts that if it is successful in obtaining certain of the vehemently opposed relief that it seeks \nagainst the primary party defendant,1 and if the relief ordered turns out to be of a nature that could \ntrigger consent provisions in the lease of the ground underneath the plant, then Specialty might \nunreasonably withhold its consent for its lessee to engage in whatever construction might be \nnecessary under the potential future order.  \nAs shown below, the speculative assertions in the Plaintiff’s Complaint as to a potential \nfuture dispute between others under a contract to which the Plaintiff is not even a party fail to set \nforth a justiciable case and controversy that is ripe for review and cannot establish jurisdiction to \njustify including an otherwise nonparty in this expensive, burdensome, and highly complicated \nlitigation. Moreover, these same hypothetical allegations fail to set forth a substantive claim  upon \nwhich relief may be granted. \nAccordingly, Specialty submits this Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss the \nclaims and relief sought against it under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which this Court can grant \nrelief against Specialty. As discussed in detail below, these claims against Specialty are premature, \nspeculative, hypothetical, and conclusory, at best. There is no existing controversy with regard to \nSpecialty. There is no set of existing facts triggering any provision of the lease. There has been no \nrequest for compliance with any provision of the lease. And so, of course, there has been no threat \nof noncompliance with the lease.  \nThe dismissal of Specialty from this matter will not frustrate the implementation of a court \norder or the proper administration of justice. There is no current order to be interfered with. This \n1Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC (“Denka”).\n2 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 3 of 18\nkey factor consequently makes the hypothetical issues and preemptive claims against Specialty \nnot ripe for review, because this Court has not issued an order that Specialty has either failed to \ncomply with, nor has Specialty impaired Denka’s compliance with any order by unreasonably \nwithholding consent for necessary construction activities.  \nAccordingly, both for lack of jurisdiction over this  prematurely filed claim and the \nPlaintiff’s Complaint’s substantive failure to state a claim upon which this Court can grant relief \nagainst Specialty, Specialty should be dismissed from the litigation pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). \nI. Factual Background \nIn 2015, Denka purchased the neoprene manufacturing operations at the Pontchartrain \nPlant (the “Denka Facility”) from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“EID”) (Complaint \n¶27). However, Denka did not purchase the land on which the Denka Facility is located. On \nOctober 30, 2015 (effective October 31, 2015), Denka and EID entered into a ground lease for the \nimmovable property underlying the Denka Facility (the “Ground Lease”), thereby creating a \nlessee/lessor relationship.  The lessor’s rights under the Ground Lease were transferred to Specialty \nin 2019. Pursuant to the Ground Lease, the lessee (Denka) may be required to obtain the lessor’s \nconsent for certain types of construction activities. This consent cannot be unreasonably withheld.  \nThere is no prior actual history of EID or Specialty not giving consent to Denka to perform \nany construction activities necessary to comply with any orders to reduce emissions or take any \nother action. For example, as set forth in the Plaintiff’s Complaint, in connection with a January \n6, 2017, agreed upon Administrative Order on Consent issued by the LDEQ, Denka voluntarily \nreduced  chloroprene  emissions  from  its  neoprene  manufacturing  operations  through  the \nconstruction of a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (“RTO”). (See Complaint ¶34.)  Notably, the \nComplaint contains no allegation that there was ever a lease dispute or that the lessor failed to give \n3 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 4 of 18\nconsent to this or any other Denka emission reduction construction activity to date. (Indeed, it has \nnot.) \nOn March 3, 2023, the Plaintiff filed this Complaint which seeks relief against Specialty for \nthe following hypothetical issues and preemptive claims: \n “in order for complete relief to be afforded in this matter the Court may need to \ninvolve DuPont because it maintains rights or interests under the Ground Lease as \nthe owner of the land upon which Denka’s neoprene manufacturing operations are \nlocated.” Complaint at ¶26. \n “the relief that the United States seeks from Denka may require onsite construction \nor other work that work that requires Dupont’s consent . . .” Id\n “Based  on  the  terms  of  the  Ground  Lease,  Denka  may  need  permission  or \ncooperation from DuPont in order take the necessary actions to abate the imminent \nand  substantial  endangerment  posed  by  its  current  chloroprene  emissions.” \nComplaint at ¶ 65. \n “Any delay or refusal by DuPont Specialty Products to authorize Denka under the \nGround Lease to comply with the requirements of any order of this Court will \ncontribute to the emissions of air pollution with the meaning of 42 U.S.C § 7412.” \nComplaint at ¶66. \n(Emphasis added.) As explained below, these allegations fail to establish either that this Honorable \nCourt has subject matter jurisdiction over this claim or that the allegations state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted. \nII. Legal Standard \nAs the party asserting jurisdiction, Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that this Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction over the claim against Specialty.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). “[A] motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be \ngranted only if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his \nclaim that would entitle plaintiff to relief.” Ramming v. United States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. \n4 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 5 of 18\n2001).  A court may base its disposition of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) on the \nfollowing: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts; or (3) the \ncomplaint  supplemented  by  undisputed  facts  plus  the  court’s  resolution  of  disputed  facts. \nAmbraco, Inc. v. Bossclip B.V., 570 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir. 2009).  \nThe standard of review applicable to a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is similar to \nthat applicable to motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Williams v. Wynne, 533 F.3d 360, 364-\n65 n.2 (5th Cir. 2008) (observing that the Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) standards are similar, \nbut noting that applying the Rule 12(b)(1) standard permits the Court to consider a broader range \nof materials in resolving the motion). To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6), a complaint must allege sufficient facts to “‘state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). “Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above \nthe speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Courts will “assess a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion only on ‘the facts stated in the complaint and the documents either attached to or \nincorporated in the complaint.’” Ferguson v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp., 802 F.3d 777, 780 \n(5th Cir. 2015). \nHere, the Plaintiff  asserts jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. The All \nWrits Act empowers a federal court to \"issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their \nrespective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). \nHowever, this statute does not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction. V.N.A. of Greater Tift \nCounty, Inc. v. Heckler, 711 F.2d 1020, 1024 n.5 (11th Cir. 1983). As a result, Plaintiff fails to \nmeet its burden of demonstrating subject matter jurisdiction.  \nThe Act enables a federal court to \"issue such commands ... as may be necessary or \n5 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 6 of 18\nappropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued in its \nexercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained[.]\" United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, \n172, 98 S. Ct. 364, 372 (1977). The Supreme Court has held, \"[t]he power conferred by the Act \nextends, under appropriate circumstances, to persons who, though not parties to the original action \nor engaged in wrongdoing, are in a position to frustrate the implementation of a court order or the \nproper administration of justice ... \" New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 174 (citations omitted). \nHowever, the authority granted in the All Writs Act is an “extraordinary remedy,” which should \nnot be issued unless the issuing court is satisfied that it is appropriate under the circumstances. \nCheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004); State of La. v. Geason, \nNo.  00-144,  2000  WL  782067,  at  *2  (E.D.  La.  June  16,  2000)  (quoting  ITT  Community \nDevelopment Corp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351, 1358-59 (5th Cir. 1978)). This case does not warrant \nthis extraordinary remedy, nor is it otherwise available, as there is no currently justiciable case and \ncontroversy with regard to Specialty that can give rise to independent subject matter jurisdiction \nin this case.  \nFurther, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a claim for relief \nthat is plausible on its face. The Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege any facts to support an \nargument that there is an actual controversy regarding Specialty’s consent (or failure to give \nconsent) under provisions of the Ground Lease which would prevent Denka from performing under \na hypothetical order. Further, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege any facts supporting a \nfinding that there is an actual disagreement or controversy between Specialty and Denka regarding \nany contractual provision, or that Specialty has interfered with Denka’s performance under any \ncourt order (considering the Court has not issued an order yet). Instead, the Plaintiff’s Complaint \nonly presents hypothetical issues that are speculative. (See Complaint ¶¶ 26, 65, 66.) “Factual \n6 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 7 of 18\nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”2 Here, the \nPlaintiff’s allegations against Specialty are purely speculative, and Plaintiff’s Complaint does not \nstate  a  claim  of  relief  against  Specialty.  Accordingly,  the  Complaint  cannot  survive  either \nSpecialty’s Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6) motion, and Specialty’s Motion to Dismiss should be \ngranted. \nIII. Argument \nA. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction Over the Relief Sought Against Specialty. \n1) The Relief Sought Against Specialty is not Ripe for Review. \nThe basic function of ripeness is “to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature \nadjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.” Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S. 136 at 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507. In fact, a test for ripeness is mandated by the constitutional \nrequirement that federal jurisdiction extends only to actual cases or controversies.” Ernst & Young \nv. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir.1995). Because the claims against \nSpecialty are not ripe for review, they should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(1). \nHere, the issues that are presented against Specialty are not immediate and are far from \nripe. Rather, they are hypothetical and preemptive, and do not show any actual harm. Plaintiff’s \nown assertions illustrate this point. Within its Complaint, Plaintiff’s states that the Court “may \nneed” to involve Specialty (Complaint¶¶ 26, 65, 66, emphasis added) in order for complete relief \nto be afforded: \n “in order for complete relief to be afforded in this matter the Court may need to \ninvolve DuPont because it maintains rights or interests under the Ground lease as \nthe owner of the land upon which Denka’s neoprene manufacturing operations are \nlocated.” Complaint at ¶26. \n2 SeeTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).\n7 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 8 of 18\n “.  .  .the  relief  that  the  United  States  seeks  from  Denka  may  require  onsite \nconstruction or other work that work that requires Dupont’s consent . . .” Id.\n “Based  on  the  terms  of  the  Ground  Lease,  Denka  may  need  permission  or \ncooperation from DuPont in order take the necessary actions to abate the imminent \nand  substantial  endangerment  posed  by  its  current  chloroprene  emissions.” \nComplaint at ¶ 65. \n(Emphasis added.) \nThe Plaintiff has not identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if \nSpecialty were not included as a Party in this action. This Court has not issued an order that \nSpecialty has either failed to comply with or impaired Denka’s compliance by withholding consent \nfor necessary construction activities. Moreover, the Ground Lease specifically provides that \nSpecialty’s consent cannot be unreasonably withheld.  \nAs such, Specialty’s position is no different than any office or agency, such as parish \nbuilding permits or the fire department, whose authority may be implicated at some future time in \nthe event that Denka is not successful in opposing the Plaintiff’s case, and in the event that the \nspecific relief awarded takes the form of requiring the type of specific construction activities that \ntrigger potential approval processes. The Plaintiff has not attempted to force any of those other \npotential approval sources to expend the significant resources necessary to participate in this \nlitigation while they await the outcome of the dispute between the Plaintiff and Denka. \nFurther, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not point to any facts to support the argument that \nSpecialty would withhold consent for future construction activities potentially ordered by this \nCourt. To the contrary, the Complaint alleges facts which support a presumption that Specialty \nwould comply with the terms of the Ground Lease by directing the Court’s attention to construction \nat the site that was conducted while the Ground Lease was in place. (See Complaint ¶34.)  As the \nComplaint states, Denka has made efforts since 2017 to reduce emissions by undergoing various \n8 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 9 of 18\nconstruction activities at the Pontchartrain Site. Id. There is no evidence, or even allegation, that \nDenka’s lessor unreasonably withheld consent to perform those activities. The activities all took \nplace without any required intervention from any court.  \n2) Fed R. Civ. P. 19(a) Does Not Provide a Basis for Jurisdiction in this Matter, \nNor is Specialty a Required Party under Rule 19(a).  \nWhile Plaintiff’s Complaint states that it is seeking relief “based on Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a),” \nthis rule does not itself provide any independent basis for jurisdiction over a claim against \nSpecialty. It is a purely procedural rule. As stated in the 1937 Advisory Committee Notes to the \nrule, Subdivision (a) is “subject to Rule 82.” Fed R. Civ. P. 82 states that “These rules do not extend \nor limit the jurisdiction of the district courts …” Accordingly, Rule 19(a) provides no basis to keep \nSpecialty in this case.  \nAdditionally, Specialty is not a party which would be required to be joined under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 19, even if subject matter jurisdiction did exist.  Rule 19(a) provides: \na) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible. \n(1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of process and whose \njoinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a \nparty if: \n(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among \nexisting parties; or \n(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so \nsituated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may: \n(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the \ninterest; or \n(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, \nmultiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest. \nThe instant case is an injunction proceeding calling for Denka to reduce its chloroprene \nemissions. Specialty is not required to be “joined” in this litigation for the Court to grant such an \n9 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 10 of 18\ninjunction concerning Denka’s operations. Specialty does not own or operate the Denka Facility. \nInstead, Specialty is a third party that cannot make any of the changes to the Denka Facility that \nthe Plaintiff is seeking. This Court can provide complete relief between the Plaintiff and Denka \nwithout Specialty’s presence in this litigation. Further, dismissing Specialty from this action will \nnot impair or impede the Plaintiff’s ability to protect its interest. Indeed, Denka did not include \nSpecialty in its compulsory counterclaims, because it must recognize that Specialty is not a \nrequired or necessary party to resolve its disputes with Plaintiff. Accordingly, Specialty is not a \nRequired Party as defined by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a) and should be dismissed.  \nB. Relief against Specialty is not covered by the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). \nThe All Writs Act allows courts to issue writs that are necessary or appropriate in aid of \ntheir jurisdiction. However, under the express language of the statute itself, this power should only \nbe exercised in cases where there is an immediate need for judicial intervention. 28 U.S.C. § \n1651(a). If the issue at hand is not ripe for review or is not likely to cause harm in the near future, \nthen the court should not use the All Writs Act to address it.  \nThe All Writs Act does not allow courts to preemptively address potential future harm. The \nstatute’s threshold requires immediate and necessary action. 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). The plain text \nof § 1651(a) confers on all federal courts the authority to issue orders where three requirements \nare satisfied: \n1. Issuance of the writ must be “in aid of” the issuing court’s jurisdiction;\n2. The type of writ requested must be “necessary or appropriate” to provide such aid to \nthe issuing court’s jurisdiction; and \n3. The issuance of the writ must be “agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” \n10 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 11 of 18\nIf an application under the Act meets all three of those requirements, the court “may” issue the \nrequested writ in the exercise of its discretion — but it is never required to do so. Here, the \nrequirements are simply not met.  \nFirst, the issuance of a writ against Specialty would not be “in  aid” of the court’s \njurisdiction because the Court may order the relief requested by Plaintiff without issuing a writ \nagainst Specialty. With regard to third parties positioned as Specialty is here, the power conferred \nby the All Writs Act extends, under appropriate circumstances, to persons who, though not parties \nto the original action or engaged in wrongdoing, are in a position to frustrate the implementation \nof a court order or the proper administration of justice, and encompasses even those who have not \ntaken any affirmative action to hinder justice. See N.Y. Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 174-98 S.Ct. 364. \nHowever, there is no current court order on the matter; and Specialty is not in any position to \nfrustrate the implementation of a court order.  \nThe Court in N.Y. Tel Co., illustrated an extraordinary circumstance in which a court \nexercised its All Writs Act authority over a third party when the third party frustrated the \nimplementation of a court order. In N.Y. Tel Co., the district court determined that probable cause \nexisted to justify the use of a pen register (a device to record telephone numbers that are dialed) in \na  criminal  investigation,  and  it  ordered  a  local  telephone  company  (New  York  Telephone \nCompany) to assist the FBI with its investigation. New York Telephone Company refused to \ncooperate fully because of its concern that a pen register qualified as a wiretap, which would trigger \nstringent procedural requirements that were not followed. Id., at 163, 98 S.Ct. 364. The lower court \nruled that pen registers were not wiretaps and then issued an All Writs Act order directing New \nYork Telephone Company to comply with the previously issued order. Id. The Supreme Court \naffirmed, reasoning that there was no way the FBI could have accomplished its court-authorized \n11 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 12 of 18\nsurveillance without the company’s cooperation; the phone company (a public utility with a “duty \nto serve the public”) was not far removed from the controversy because its facilities were being \nused in a crime; and the assistance required was not “in any way burdensome.” Id. at 174–75, 98 \nS.Ct. 364. \nThe holding in N.Y. Tel Co. is clearly not applicable here. Unlike in N.Y. Tel. Co., Specialty \nis not interfering with the implementation of any order issued by this Court. As such, the Act \nshould not extend relief sought against Specialty under the All Writs Act. Further, it would be \nincredibly burdensome for Specialty to have to participate in this obviously highly involved and \nexpensive litigation while it waits to see if an order might be issued against Denka that would \ntrigger a decision to be made under the Ground Lease. Additionally, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does \nnot point to any facts that suggest that Specialty would not cooperate with any order the Court \n“may” render requiring Denka to make improvements to the Denka Site that would require \nSpecialty’s consent. The fact that the Court may order some relief that may require that Denka \ninteract with third parties to carry out the relief does not make the All Writs Act apply to mandate \nthat such third parties appear before the Court in advance and be forced to submit to all future \npotential outcomes. The All Writs Act cannot be used as an “in advance road grader” to clear all \npotential future bumps in the road that may arise post litigation under Plaintiff’s presumption that \nit will be successful in all that it asks for. \nSecond, the Plaintiff’s claim is not necessary to aid the court’s jurisdiction because, again, \nthere is no order issued by this Court to enforce. There is no actual controversy regarding \nSpecialty’s consent (or failure to give consent) under provisions of the Ground Lease which would \nprevent  Denka  from  performing  under  an  order.  Here,  there  is  no  actual  disagreement  or \ncontroversy between Specialty and Denka regarding any contractual provision, and Specialty \n12 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 13 of 18\ncertainly has not interfered with Denka’s performance under any court order, nor does the Plaintiff \neven allege this. The Court’s involvement in the matter would constitute sitting in an advisory \ncapacity on a hypothetical future disagreement between Denka and Specialty.  \nThird, the Plaintiff’s involvement in Denka’s and Specialty’s contractual relationship \ncreated by the Ground lease is not “agreeable to the usages and principles of law”, as is required \nby the statute. 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), because it is not agreeable to basic principles of contract law. \nThe Plaintiff is not in privity of contract with either Denka or Specialty. As such, the Plaintiff has \nno right to ask this Court to give an advisory opinion on how this contract, to which it is not a \nparty, should be interpreted under future hypothetical facts. If at some future time there is a set of \nfacts in existence which gives rise to certain of Denka’s and Specialty’s relative rights and \nresponsibilities under the Ground Lease, Denka and Specialty will determine whether they have \nany disagreement as to consent. The Plaintiff has no right to attempt to interject itself into this \nthird-party contractual relationship, and the law does not allow it.  \nLastly, this litigation simply does not present any extraordinary circumstances that would \njustify the exercise of this Court’s All Writs Act authority. As the Plaintiff knows from this Court’s \nreview of EPA’s own Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction in Consol. Envtl. Mgt., Inc. v. \nMcCarthy, 16-1432, 2016 WL 6876647, at *1 (E.D. La. Nov. 22, 2016) (opinion attached hereto \nas Exhibit A), the exercise of All Writs Act authority is an extraordinary remedy. Id. at *6. The \ndispute in Consol. Envtl. Mgt., Inc. v. McCarthy, arose out of the EPA’s actions in response to \npetitions filed in an earlier matter pursuant to Title V of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), 42 U.S.C. § \n7661d(b)(2), requesting that EPA object to permits initially issued to Nucor Steel Louisiana, LLC \n(“Nucor”) by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) in 2010 and 2011 \nfor two industrial processes at Nucor’s plant in St. James Parish, Louisiana. Id. at *1. The EPA’s \n13 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 14 of 18\nresponse to those petitions included orders issued on March 23, 2012 (“2012 Order”) and on \nJanuary 30, 2014 (“2014 Order”)  (jointly referred to as “Orders”).  In the 2012 Order, the EPA \nissued an objection, as requested by the petitioner. In the 2014 Order, the EPA granted the petition \nin part, issuing objections as to certain issues, but denied the petition as to other issues. Id. \nThereafter, certain parties in that original matter filed a new citizen suit. Id. The Consol. \nEnvtl. Mgt., Inc. plaintiff brought claims against the EPA and sought, among other things, a \ndeclaratory judgment to specify which future actions the EPA could take and deal with any \npotential future objections by EPA to upcoming permit renewals. Id. at *2. The complaint alleged \nthat the Court had jurisdiction over its claims pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the Administrative \nProcedure Act, and the All Writs Act.  \nIn response, EPA filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. EPA’s \nmotion asserted, among other things, that the plaintiff’s argument regarding the permit renewals \nwas simply based upon speculation as to what EPA and other parties may do in the future. EPA \nadvised that this failed to establish the existence of a current or sufficiently imminent injury to \nestablish standing. \nThe Court granted EPA’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on multiple grounds. \nAs a part of its opinion, this Court found that the All Writs Act did not avail plaintiffs for two \nreasons. Id. at *6. First, it recognized that the All Writs Act does not create or enlarge jurisdiction \nand does not allow this Court to provide relief that is outside the Court’s jurisdiction. Id. (citing \nSingh v. Duane Morris LLP, 538 F.3d 334, 341 (5th Cir. 2008). Because the Court otherwise \nlacked jurisdiction to grant the relief plaintiffs requested, it also found that the All Writs Act was \nnot applicable.Secondly, this Court explained that “the authority granted in the All Writs Act is \nan ‘extraordinary remedy,’ which should not be issued unless the issuing court is satisfied that it \n14 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 15 of 18\nis appropriate under the circumstances.”  Id. (citing Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of \nColumbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004); State of La. v. Geason, No. 00-144, 2000 WL 782067, at *2 \n(E.D. La. June 16, 2000) (quoting ITT Community Development Corp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351, \n1358-59 (5th Cir. 1978)). The Court concluded that the case did not warrant the extraordinary \nremedy sought by the plaintiffs there.\nHere,  like  in  Consol.  Envtl.  Mgt.,  Inc.,  there  are  no  extraordinary  circumstances  or \nextraordinary factors that would warrant the extraordinary remedy of exercising the Court’s All \nWrits Act authority. The claims made are clearly speculative as to some theoretical injury that may \noccur in the future if certain circumstances come into existence. Moreover, the remedy sought by \nthe Plaintiff here is even more extraordinary than the remedy sought in Consol. Envtl. Mgt., Inc., \nbecause the Plaintiff here is asking the Court to exercise its All Writs authority over a third party \nand sit in an advisory capacity on a hypothetical future disagreement between Denka and Specialty \nunder a contract to which the Plaintiff is not even a party.  Accordingly, Specialty’s Motion should \nbe granted, and the claims against Specialty should be dismissed. \nC.  The Claims Against Specialty Should Be Dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12 (b)(6). \nAlternatively, under the very similar analysis noted above, the claims against Specialty \nshould be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). To survive a motion to \ndismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matters, accepted as true, to state a claim of \nrelief that is plausible on its face. See Gonzalez v. Kay, 577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). In deciding whether dismissal is warranted, the Court \nwill not accept conclusory allegations in the complaint as true. Kaiser Aluminum Etc. v. Avondale \nShipyards, 677 F.2d 1045 at 1050. Further, a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure can be based on the failure to allege a cognizable legal theory or \n15 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 16 of 18\nthe failure to allege sufficient facts under a cognizable legal theory. Robertson v. Dean Witter \nReynolds, Inc., 749 F.2d 530, 533-34 (9th Cir.1984). To withstand a motion to dismiss pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6), a complaint must set forth factual allegations sufficient “to raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level.”  See Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). “[A] plaintiff’s obligation \nto provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief,” thus, “requires more than labels and \nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” See\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nHere, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that \nis plausible on its face. The Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege any facts to support any argument \nthat there is an actual controversy regarding Specialty’s consent (or failure to give consent) under \nany provision of the Ground Lease which would prevent Denka from performing under an order. \nFurther, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege any facts supporting a finding that there is an \nactual disagreement or controversy between Specialty and Denka regarding any contractual \nprovision, or that Specialty has interfered with Denka’s performance under any court order.  \nInstead, the Plaintiff’s Complaint only presents the Plaintiff’s speculation that if it is \nsuccessful in obtaining certain of the vehemently opposed relief that it seeks against the primary \nparty defendant, and if the relief ordered turns out to be of a nature that could trigger consent \nprovisions in the lease of the ground underneath the plant, then Specialty might unreasonably \nwithhold its consent for its lessee to engage in whatever construction might be necessary under the \npotential future order. “Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level.”3 The allegations in the Plaintiff’s Complaint against Specialty simply do not \nrise above the speculative level. Therefore, the Plaintiff’s Complaint does not state a claim of relief \n3 SeeTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).\n16 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 17 of 18\nagainst Specialty for which relief can be granted by this Court. Accordingly, the Complaint cannot \nsurvive this Rule 12(b)(6) Motion, and Specialty’s Motion to Dismiss should be granted. \nCONCLUSION \nAs set forth above, Specialty should be dismissed from this litigation pursuant to Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). First, neither the All Writs Act nor Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 19(a) provide an independent basis for jurisdiction in this matter. The Plaintiff’s \nComplaint must independently meet the standards of ripeness and justiciability, which it does not.  \nMoreover, Specialty is not a Required Party, as defined by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n19(a). This Court can afford complete relief amongst the Plaintiff and Denka without Specialty’s \npresence in this litigation. Further, dismissing Specialty from this action does not impair or impede \nPlaintiff’s ability to protect its interest. The dismissal of Specialty in this matter will not frustrate \nthe implementation of a court order or the proper administration of justice, because there is no \ncurrent order that Specialty has either failed to comply with or impaired Denka’s compliance by \nwithholding consent for necessary constructions activities.\nThis Honorable Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 19(a), the All Writs Act or any other authority as to the claims against Specialty. \nThe Plaintiff’s allegations against Specialty are only speculative, and Plaintiff’s Complaint does \nnot state a claim for relief against Specialty that can be granted by this Court. Accordingly, the \nComplaint cannot survive this Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) motion.Thus, Specialty should be \ndismissed from the litigation. \n17 \n{N2029540 -}\n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 49-1   Filed 05/02/23   Page 18 of 18\nRespectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Eric E.

Regan, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n(“EPA”).  DPE denies each and every allegation contained in the Complaint, except as expressly \nadmitted herein. \nI.  ANSWER \nThe  unnumbered  paragraph  under  the  heading  “Complaint”  does  not  contain  any \nallegations and does not require a response.   \n1.  The first sentence of Paragraph 1 purports to summarize the nature of the Complaint \nto which no response is required.  To the extent a response is required, DPE denies the allegations.  \nIn response to the second sentence of Paragraph 1, DPE admits that the Facility’s address is in \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 2 of 66\nLaPlace, Louisiana, but denies the remaining allegations of that sentence.  DPE denies the \nallegations of the third sentence of Paragraph 1. The fourth sentence of Paragraph 1 purports to \nsummarize the relief sought by the Complaint to which no response is required.  To the extent a \nresponse to the fourth sentence is required, DPE denies that the United States is entitled to any \nrelief.      \n2.  The first sentence of Paragraph 2 purports to summarize the relief sought by the \nComplaint against DuPont Specialty Products USA, LLC (“DuPont”), to which no response is \nrequired.  To the extent a response to the first sentence is required, DPE denies that the United \nStates is entitled to any relief.  DPE admits the allegations of the second sentence of Paragraph 2.  \nDPE admits the allegations of the third sentence of Paragraph 2.  The fourth sentence of Paragraph \n2 consists of legal conclusions to which no response is required.  To the extent a response to the \nfourth sentence is required, DPE denies the allegations.  The fifth sentence of Paragraph 2 purports \nto reference a document, which speaks for itself and is the best evidence of its content.  To the \nextent a response to the fifth sentence is required, DPE denies the allegations.   \n3.  DPE admits the allegations of the first sentence of Paragraph 3.  DPE admits the \nallegations of the second sentence of Paragraph 3.  In response to the allegations of the third \nsentence of Paragraph 3, DPE admits only that 1,3-butadiene and chlorine are listed as hazardous \nair pollutants in the Clean Air Act if emitted into the atmosphere.  DPE admits the allegations of \nthe fourth sentence of Paragraph 3.   \n4.  DPE denies the allegations of Paragraph 4, and further avers that the allegations of \nParagraph 4 are based on EPA’s 2010 Toxicological Review of Chloroprene (“2010 Review”), in \nwhich EPA estimated that, assuming humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as the female B6C3F1 \nmouse, continuously breathing chloroprene at concentrations averaging one μg/m3 for 24 hours \n2 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 3 of 66\nper day over a 70-year lifetime—an obviously counterfactual assumption—would produce five \nexcess cancers (that is, in excess of what is expected in unexposed populations) for every 10,000 \npeople.  Based on this, EPA alleges that continuous exposure to 0.2 μg/m3 for 70 years increases \na person’s risk of developing cancer by 1-in-10,000.  DPE further avers that EPA’s 2010 Review \nand resulting 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene are fundamentally flawed because, in setting that \nvalue, EPA relied upon a default assumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as a \nfemale B6C3F1 mouse, which was the most sensitive animal species and gender in the laboratory \nexperiments conducted by EPA on the effects of exposure to chloroprene.  DPE further avers that \nthis was a fundamental error by EPA, as the peer reviewers of the 2010 Review expressly informed \nEPA at the time, due to the substantial toxicokinetic differences between the female B6C3F1 \nmouse and humans, resulting in EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 value dramatically overstating the human cancer \nrisks associated with exposure to chloroprene.  DPE further avers that EPA—initially in setting \nthe 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene, and now in seeking to enforce that value as the underlying \ndriver for its Complaint—fails to consider the best available scientific information and is contrary \nto the weight and preponderance of scientific evidence, including (i) the use of the peer-reviewed \nphysiologically-based pharmacokinetic (“PBPK”) model, developed (with EPA’s support and \ncollaboration) by scientists at Ramboll US Consulting, Inc. (“Ramboll PBPK model”),  specifically \ndesigned to make adjustments in risk assessments based upon the different toxicological effects of \na chemical from one species to another, such as female B6C3F1 mice to humans; (ii) the most \nrecent and robust, and peer-reviewed epidemiological study of chloroprene, which focused on \nhumans (not female mice) who worked at chloroprene-emitting facilities, including the Facility \nwhen operated by DuPont, were exposed to substantially higher chloroprene emissions, and \nshowed no increase in cancer mortalities; and (iii) the empirical and state-audited data from the \n3 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 4 of 66\nLouisiana Tumor Registry showing cancer incidence rates in the community surrounding the \nFacility  that  are  significantly  lower  than  state-wide  averages  despite  decades  of  historical \nemissions of chloroprene from the Facility (before it was owned by DPE) that were at least an \norder of magnitude higher than current emissions. \n5.  DPE denies the allegations of Paragraph 5, including for the reasons set forth in \nresponse to Paragraph 4 above. \n6.  DPE denies the allegations of the first sentence of Paragraph 6.  DPE admits the \nallegations of the second sentence of Paragraph 6. \n7.  Paragraph 7 consists of legal conclusions to which no response is required.  Further, \nParagraph  7  purports  to  reference  federal  statutes  and  other  documents,  which  speak  for \nthemselves and are the best evidence of their content.  To the extent a response is required, DPE \ndenies the allegations and avers that a 1-in-10,000 cancer risk described in Paragraph 7 has never \nbeen the basis of an emergency action under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401, et \nseq.   \n8.  In response to the allegations of the first sentence of Paragraph 8, DPE admits only \nthat  EPA,  based  on  EPA’s  2010  Review,  has  estimated  that  breathing  chloroprene  at \nconcentrations averaging 0.2 μg/m3 over a 70-year lifetime increases a person’s risk of developing \ncancer by 1-in-10,000, but DPE avers that EPA’s 2010 Review and resulting 0.2 μg/m3 value \ncounterfactually assume that every resident within a 2.5 mile radius of the Facility is exposed to \nchloroprene 24 hours a day for 70 years.  DPE further avers that EPA’s 2010 Review and resulting \n0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene are fundamentally flawed because, in setting that value, EPA \nrelied upon a default assumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as a female B6C3F1 \nmouse, which was the most sensitive animal species and gender in the laboratory experiments \n4 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 5 of 66\nconducted by EPA on the effects of exposure to chloroprene, without scientific basis and merely \nas a default policy determination.  DPE further avers that this was a fundamental error by EPA, as \nthe majority of the peer reviewers of the 2010 Review expressly informed EPA at the time, due to \nthe substantial toxicokinetic differences between the female B6C3F1 mouse and humans, resulting \nin EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 value dramatically overstating the human cancer  risks associated with \nexposure to chloroprene.  DPE further avers that, in setting, and now seeking to enforce, the 0.2 \nμg/m3 value for chloroprene as the underlying driver for its Complaint, EPA’s allegations fail to \nconsider the best available scientific information or the weight of scientific evidence as averred \nabove in Paragraph 4.  DPE denies the allegations of the second and third sentences of Paragraph \n8. \n9.  In response to the allegations of the first sentence of Paragraph 9, DPE admits only \nthat average concentrations of chloroprene measured at monitored locations in the vicinity of the \nFacility have been consistently greater than 0.2 μg/m3 since 2016, but avers that (i) DPE emissions \nof chloroprene are within the limits prescribed by air permits issued by the Louisiana Department \nof Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) under the oversight of EPA; (ii) DPE has dramatically \nreduced the magnitude and scope of chloroprene concentrations outside of the Facility since it \npurchased the Facility in November 2015; (iii) neither set of monitors referenced in Paragraph 9 \nsampled ambient air on a continuous basis; and (iv) chloroprene concentrations sampled from 2016 \nuntil 2022 are not representative of present conditions.  DPE admits the allegations of the second \nsentence of Paragraph 9.

DPE denies that the entire 2010 Review was “confirmed by an \nindependent external peer review panel” and avers that EPA’s response to public comments and \n12 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 13 of 66\npeer review comments, particularly as set forth in Appendix A to the 2010 Review, made gross \nscientific errors and improperly disregarded scientific criticism.   \n42.  In response to the first sentence of Paragraph 42, DPE admits only that in the 2010 \nReview EPA purported to quantify the cancer risks associated with long-term chronic inhalation \nexposure due to chloroprene, but DPE avers that there were fundamental flaws in the 2010 Review, \nincluding for the reasons set forth in response to Paragraph 8 above, and that the 0.2 μg/m3 value \nfor chloroprene dramatically overstates the human cancer risks associated with exposure to \nchloroprene.  DPE denies the remaining allegations in the first sentence of Paragraph 42.  The \nsecond sentence of Paragraph 42 purports to reference the 2010 Review, which speaks for itself \nand is the best evidence of its content.

DPE denies the allegations of the third sentence of \nParagraph 43, including for the reasons set forth in response to Paragraph 8 above.   \n44.  DPE admits the allegations in the first sentence of Paragraph 44. DPE lacks \nknowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of the allegations related to \n13 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 14 of 66\nEPA’s intent in the second sentence of Paragraph 44.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \nFurther answering, DPE specifically pleads the following affirmative defenses.  To the \nextent that the following defenses appear contradictory or mutually exclusive, DPE pleads said \ndefenses in the alternative. \nFirst Affirmative Defense \nIn conducting the 2010 Review, EPA was obligated to consider the best scientific data \navailable to EPA at the time of its decision, and its failure to do so, resulting in the setting of a 0.2 \nμg/m3  value  for  chloroprene,  was  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  and  not  in \naccordance with law, in violation of the APA.  \nSecond Affirmative Defense \nBased  on  numerous  errors  in  the  2010  Review,  following  the  procedures  in  EPA’s \nInformation Quality Guidelines, DPE filed a Request for Correction on June 26, 2017 (“2017 \nRequest for Correction”).   EPA denied the 2017 Request for Correction in January 2018, stating \nthat the 2010 Review had been externally peer reviewed, and subjected to public comment and \ncomments from other federal agencies and offices of the White House.  EPA concluded that it \nwould only update the 2010 Review based on new scientific evidence, particularly referring to the \npossible use of a PBPK model.  EPA’s denial of the 2017 Request for Correction was arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA. \nThird Affirmative Defense \nFollowing the denial of the 2017 Request for Correction, DPE submitted to EPA a Work \nPlan for the development of a chloroprene PBPK model to better represent human sensitivity to \n17 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 18 of 66\nchloroprene than the default assumption utilized by EPA in the 2010 Review that humans are as \nsensitive as the female B6C3F1 mouse.  EPA worked cooperatively with DPE for more than two \nyears on the development of a PBPK model.  In October 2020, EPA sponsored through its \ncontractor Versar, Inc. (“Versar”), a purportedly independent peer review of the PBPK model.  \nImportantly, Versar was not an independent peer review organization, because EPA now claims \nthat its communications with Versar are protected from disclosure to the public because Versar is \npart of the agency for purposes of Freedom of Information Act Exemption 5.  Based on comments \nfrom the peer review panel, DPE’s contractor Ramboll substantially revised the PBPK model to \nprovide an even better predictive capacity of cross species response to chloroprene.  On July 2021, \nwith the “new scientific evidence” of a peer reviewed Ramboll PBPK model, DPE submitted its \nsecond Request for Correction (“2021 Request for Correction”). Unknown to DPE or the public, \nin  April  2021,  EPA  Region  6  nominated  chloroprene  to  EPA’s  IRIS  program  for  a  new \ntoxicological review.  On March 14, 2022, EPA denied DPE’s 2021 Request for Correction, stating \nthat EPA had no obligation to update prior toxicological assessments unless the chemical was \nnominated for toxicological review as a national or regional priority and accepted by the IRS \nprogram for further review. On June 10, 2022, utilizing an administrative appeal procedure \nprovided by the Information Quality Guidelines, DPE filed a Request for Reconsideration of the \ndenial of the 2021 Request for Correction (“2022 Request for Reconsideration”).  On October 19, \n2022,  EPA  denied  the  2022  Request  for  Reconsideration.    Under  the  Information  Quality \nGuidelines, the agency’s decision on a Request for Reconsideration is “final agency action.”  For \nmany reasons, including but not limited to EPA’s failure to disclose EPA Region 6’s nomination \nof chloroprene for toxicological review, EPA’s denial of the 2022 Request for Reconsideration \n18 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 19 of 66\nwas arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, in violation of \nthe APA.   \nFourth Affirmative Defense \nEPA’s current and ongoing application of the 2010 Review to DPE through the 0.2 μg/m3 \nvalue for chloroprene without providing a rational basis for EPA’s failure to consider the best \navailable scientific data—including the Ramboll PBPK model, Dr. Marsh’s 2021 epidemiology \nstudy,  and  the  2022  Louisiana  Tumor  Registry  data—is  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA. \nFifth Affirmative Defense \nIn denying the 2017 Request for Correction, EPA took the position that the 2010 Review \n(and resulting IUR) could only be changed based on the submission of new scientific evidence.  In \nthe 2021 Request for Correction, DPE did precisely that by providing the new Ramboll PBPK \nmodel for chloroprene, further analysis regarding the updated epidemiological study by Dr. Marsh, \nand epidemiological data from the Louisiana Tumor Registry.  However, in denying the 2021 \nRequest for Correction, EPA took the position that the purpose of the request for correction was \nto simply correct the analysis and data in the 2010 Review, and not to update the prior risk \nassessment based on new scientific evidence.  In other words, after EPA faulted DPE for not \nproviding new scientific information in the 2017 Request for Correction, EPA took the position \nthat the 2021 Request for Correction could not be granted because DPE had provided new \nscientific evidence.  EPA’s rejection of the Ramboll PBPK model was an abrupt reversal of \nposition, was not based on the evidence, data, or best scientific information available at that time, \nand was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, in violation \nof the APA. \n19 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 20 of 66\nSixth Affirmative Defense \nEPA has arbitrarily and capriciously reversed 30 years of EPA risk assessment policy \nwithout reasoned explanation by treating an estimated 1-in-10,000 risk based on the 2010 IUR in \na strict, “bright line” fashion, and this departure from 30 years of Agency risk assessment policy \nwithout  reasoned  explanation  was  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  and  not  in \naccordance with law, in violation of the APA. \nSeventh Affirmative Defense \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 7412, EPA must \nestablish technology-based emission standards for hazardous air pollutants, called Maximum \nAvailable Control Technology (“MACT”), as required by Section 112(d), 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d). \nFollowing the MACT rulemaking, if the regulated category of industry poses greater than a 1-in-\n1,000,000 risk after the application of MACT, EPA must set “residual risk” standards under \nSection 112(f)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(2), to provide the public with an “ample margin of safety.”  \nIn a significant number of residual risk evaluations, starting in 1989 (Benzene NESHAPs) and \nmost recently in 2020 (Miscellaneous Organic NESHAPS or “MON”), EPA has established \nemission standards well in excess of 1-in-10,000 risk.  For example, in 2005, in the NESHAPs for \nCoke Oven Batteries, EPA authorized a risk of 2.7-in-10,000. 70 Fed. Reg. 19992 (2005).  DPE \navers that as a matter of law a 1-in-10,000 risk does not constitute an “emergency” under Section \n303 of the Clean Air Act. \nEighth Affirmative Defense \nThe relief requested in paragraph 2 of the United States’ Prayer for Relief, seeking to \nmitigate alleged past harm to public health and welfare, is not permitted under Section 303 of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7603 and should be dismissed as a matter of law. \n20 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 21 of 66\nNinth Affirmative Defense \nThe  relief  requested  in  the Complaint  improperly  invokes  “emergency”  authority  to \ncircumvent Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to establish an “ambient air standard” for chloroprene \nin violation of Section 112(f)(2) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(2), and to circumvent \nthe required consideration of costs, energy, safety, control technologies and other relevant factors, \nsuch as risk estimation uncertainty, in regulating hazardous air pollutants.  \nTenth Affirmative Defense \nThe United States’ allegations of an emergency fail to consider risk estimation uncertainty \nin developing the IUR and the 1-in-10,000 risk estimate. EPA’s denial of DPE’s 2021 Request for \nCorrection admits that the IUR is uncertain by at least a factor of two. In fact, by basing the IUR \non the female B6C3F1 mouse without any scientific evidence to  suggest that the female B6C3F1 \nmouse is more representative of human response than the male B6C3F1 mouse (one-third less \nsensitive than the female), the Fischer rat, the Wistar rat, or the hamster (which demonstrate up to \ntwo orders of magnitude lower sensitivity), the United States has alleged an improbable risk \nestimate that fails any evidentiary weight-of-evidence test or more-probable-than-not test. \nDPE reserves the right to amend its answer to the Complaint and to assert additional \naffirmative defenses as discovery is conducted and additional defenses come to light. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Defendant DPE prays that this Answer and Affirmative Defenses be \ndeemed good and proper, and that after proper proceedings had, this Court dismiss the United \nStates’ claims against DPE, with prejudice, at the United States’ costs and expense. \n   \n21 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 22 of 66\nIII.  COUNTERCLAIMS \nDPE asserts its counterclaims against the United States of America, acting on behalf of the \nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and Michael S. Regan, Administrator of \nthe EPA.  \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  DPE operates a manufacturing facility in La Place, Louisiana (the “Facility”) that \nuses a chemical called chloroprene to produce Neoprene, a popular synthetic rubber that is used in \na  wide  array  of  products,  including  cars,  adhesives,  medical  devices,  wetsuits,  and  other \napplications.  The Facility is the only Neoprene-producing facility in the United States.   \n2.  In September 2010, EPA released a Toxicological Review of Chloroprene (“2010 \nReview”) in which EPA calculated an “inhalation unit risk” (“IUR”) for human exposure to \nchloroprene of 5 x 10-4 per µg/m3 for 70-years continuous exposure.1  Based on that IUR, EPA \nlater declared that the chloroprene concentration associated with an incremental lifetime (i.e., 70-\nyear) cancer risk level of 1-in-10,000 was 0.2 μg/m3.  In setting that stringent IUR for chloroprene, \nEPA relied upon a default assumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as the female \nB6C3F1 mouse, which was the most sensitive animal species and gender in the laboratory \nexperiments conducted on the effects of exposure to chloroprene.  As discussed below, EPA’s \ndefault assumption was (and remains) dead wrong, as it was directly undercut by the best scientific \n                                                 \n1 EPA reviews and publishes information about the health and environment effects of industrial \nchemicals in its Integrated Risk Information System (“IRIS”).  In its “IRIS assessments,” EPA \nprovides toxicity values for health effects resulting from exposure to chemicals.  For many \nchemicals, one part of this assessment is an IUR value, which is intended to be an estimate of the \nincreased cancer risk from continuous inhalation exposure to a concentration of a particular \nchemical of 1 µg/m3 for a lifetime.  In theory, an IUR can be multiplied by an estimate of lifetime \nexposure (in µg/m3) to estimate a person’s lifetime risk of developing cancer as a result of the \nchemical exposure. \n22 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 23 of 66\ninformation available to EPA when it performed the 2010 Review as well as the best scientific \ninformation available today. \n3.  As  chronicled  in  detail  below,  from  June  2017  through  October  2022,  DPE \ndiligently pursued an administrative challenge of the 2010 Review and IUR under the Information \nQuality Act, pointing out the many fundamental flaws in EPA’s analysis based on EPA’s failure \nto consider the best available scientific information, including multiple lines of evidence such as \nepidemiology,  the  Louisiana  Tumor  Registry,  and  pharmacokinetics.    EPA  rejected  those \nchallenges,  and by May  2022  was  actively  threatening to  enforce  the 0.2 μg/m3 value for \nchloroprene against the Facility.   \n4.  On January 11, 2023, DPE filed an action against EPA and EPA Administrator \nRegan in this Court alleging that the 2010 Review and subsequent enforcement of a 0.2 μg/m3 \nvalue for chloroprene was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with \nlaw in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), because EPA failed to consider the \nbest available scientific information (the “APA Action”).  As alleged in the APA Action, EPA \nsought and then ignored the best available scientific information in setting the IUR.  As further \nalleged in the APA Action, DPE diligently tried to correct EPA at every turn via the processes set \nforth in the Information Quality Act, but EPA ignored generally accepted science, in violation of \nthe APA.   \n5.  Subsequently, on February 28, 2023, EPA initiated the above-captioned action, \nalleging that the Facility’s emissions of chloroprene constitute an “imminent and substantial \nendangerment” under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act (“ISE Action”).  Relying entirely upon its \nIUR determination for chloroprene, EPA seeks an order requiring the Facility to implement \nemission reduction projects that would result in the Facility satisfying the 0.2 μg/m3 value for \n23 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 24 of 66\nchloroprene and requiring DPE to immediately take all necessary measures to eliminate the alleged \nimminent and substantial endangerment posed by chloroprene emissions from the Facility.  On \nMarch 15, 2023, the ISE Action was transferred from Section “L” to Section “J” because it is \nrelated to the APA Action.  [Doc. 6.] \n6.  On March 20, 2023, EPA filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking a \nshutdown of the Facility unless DPE complied with a host of prescriptive requirements not \nrequired by regulation [Doc. 9].  As discussed further below, EPA makes no effort to hide that its \nunprecedented action is entirely dependent on enforcing the 0.2 μg/m3 value. \n7.  EPA’s ISE Action compounds the Agency’s scientific errors in setting the IUR and \ncontinues to impose real harm on DPE.  In its crusade against chloroprene emissions, EPA’s \nunprecedented ISE Action exacerbates the flaws in, and the harm caused by, the IUR determination \nbecause (i) EPA ignores its own risk assessment protocol, which, when properly applied, undercuts \nany legitimate claim of an imminent and substantial endangerment; (ii) EPA essentially disregards \nthe most relevant epidemiological study of chloroprene, which focused on humans (not female \nmice) who worked in the chloroprene industry, were exposed to substantially higher chloroprene \nemissions, and showed no increase in cancer mortalities; (iii) EPA ignores the empirical data \nshowing cancer incidence rates in the community surrounding the Facility that are substantially \nlower than the State averages despite decades of historical emissions of chloroprene from the \nFacility (before it was owned by DPE) that were at least an order of magnitude higher than current \nemissions; (iv) EPA ignores the significant emission reductions that DPE has implemented in the \nlast 12 months via operational changes; and (v) EPA ignores the recent, and most relevant, \nfenceline monitoring data from the Facility, which shows even further reductions in chloroprene \nemissions. \n24 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 25 of 66\n8.  DPE’s counterclaims alleged herein are intended to address EPA’s violations of the \nAPA when EPA sought, and then repeatedly ignored, the best available scientific information in \nsetting the IUR for chloroprene, including its denial of DPE’s Requests for Correction, by seeking \na judgment declaring that an enforceable risk assessment must consider all available scientific \nevidence, including updated evidence beyond a flawed 13-year old IRIS toxicological review.  In \nassessing the potential risks of chloroprene for the past roughly thirteen years, EPA has often \nstressed the importance of considering and applying the best available science on risk assessment, \nas  required  by  EPA’s  Information  Quality  Guidelines,  EPA,  Guidelines  for  Ensuring  and \nMaximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (Oct. 2002), and the Information Quality Act, Pub. L. 106–\n554, §1(a)(3) [title V, §515], Dec. 21, 2000, 114 Stat. 2763 (requiring guidelines for Federal \nagencies  to  ensure and maximize “the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information \n(including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies”).  However, in actually \nsetting risk-based requirements for chloroprene, and now taking the unprecedented step of alleging \nin the ISE Action that emergency authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act (not the \nAgency’s rulemaking or permitting authorities) should be exercised by this Court to impose further \nemission reductions, EPA has again refused to consider what the Agency admits is the best \navailable scientific information.  EPA’s reason?  The Agency simply declares that it is not a \npriority and that it has no obligation to do so.  EPA is wrong.  EPA’s refusal to consider the full \nweight of available scientific evidence and to use the best available science on the potential risks \nof chloroprene to humans—and set appropriate risk-based requirements for chloroprene based on \nthat science—was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and was not in accordance with \nlaw, in violation of the APA.  \n25 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 26 of 66\n9.  Worse  still,  EPA  encouraged  DPE  to  develop  the  latest  available  scientific \ninformation and, over a multi-year period, actively collaborated with DPE in ensuring that such \nscientific information was complete, accurate, and up-to-date.  When DPE, through substantial \neffort and expense, developed that scientific information, went through two rounds of external peer \nreview overseen by EPA, and presented it to EPA, the Agency abruptly reversed course and said \nit had no obligation to consider the latest scientific information.   \n10.  To be very clear, DPE strongly supports effective environmental protection for the \nFacility’s neighbors.  As noted above, it is undisputed that, just since January 2017, DPE has \nreduced chloroprene emissions from the Facility by 85 percent (from 118 tons per year (“tpy”) to \n18 tpy) at a cost to DPE of more than $35 million.  See EPA Summary Report, Air Monitoring for \nChloroprene Concentrations in LaPlace, LA from May 25, 2016, through July 16, 2020 at 1 (“EPA \nSummary  Report”),  available  at  https://www.epa.gov/la/denka-air-monitoring-data-summaries \n(“Since March 2018, following the implementation of emission controls being installed by DPE, \nchloroprene stack emissions have been reduced by 85% and EPA air monitoring data have shown \ncorresponding significant reductions of chloroprene concentrations in the community.”).  In an \nOctober 12, 2022 “letter of concern,” issued under the authority of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, sent by EPA to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) and the \nLouisiana Department of Health (“LDH”), EPA included a figure showing the significant emission \nreductions at the Facility since 1987, particularly the substantial reductions achieved by DPE since \ncommencing operations at the Facility in 2015. \n26 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 27 of 66\n \n11.  However, rather than considering all sources of relevant information and using the \nbest  available  science  to  assure  the  Facility’s  neighbors  that  current  levels  of  chloroprene \nemissions do not pose a meaningful risk to human health, EPA appears to be following a politically \ndriven strategy to support the demands made by environmental activists and toxic tort litigants.  \nThis strategy has led EPA to disregard the best available science in order to catalyze permitting, \nrulemaking, and, ultimately, EPA’s ISE Action premised on a more stringent—and undisputedly \noutdated—determination of the potential risks of chloroprene to humans.  Upon information and \nbelief, EPA refused to consider all sources of relevant information and use the best available \nscientific information on the risks of chloroprene to humans—information that EPA encouraged \nDPE to generate—predominantly because that information is inconsistent with EPA’s politically \nexpedient strategy. \n27 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 28 of 66\nTHE PARTIES \n12.

The IQA requires \nthat influential scientific information disseminated by EPA be of appropriate “quality,” which \nconsists of utility, objectivity, and integrity.  The 2010 Review is subject to the most demanding \nrequirements  of  OMB’s  and  EPA’s  IQA  guidelines  because  it  is  “influential  scientific \ninformation” that “present[s] information on health effects” of chloroprene.  Under the IQA and \nimplementing guidelines, EPA is required to incorporate a “high degree of transparency about the \ndata and methods to facilitate the reproducibility of such information by qualified third parties.” \nSee OMB’s Government-wide Data Quality Act Guidelines, 67 Fed. Reg. 8,452, 8,455 (Feb. 22, \n2002). \n19.

The Facility.  \n20.  The Facility is in St. John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana.  The Facility was \noriginally operated by DuPont beginning in 1964.  In 1968, DuPont announced that it would begin \nNeoprene production at the Facility. \n21.  On November 1, 2015, DPE acquired the Neoprene manufacturing operations at \nthe Facility from DuPont, and such operations have been owned and operated by DPE since that \ntime. \n22.  Chloroprene is a key chemical used to produce Neoprene.  According to EPA data, \nDuPont’s operation of the Facility resulted in chloroprene emissions of approximately 500 tons \nper year in 1987.  Between 1987 and 2015, chloroprene emissions from the Facility under \nDuPont’s operation dropped to about 120 tons per year.  Since DPE acquired the Neoprene \nmanufacturing operations at the Facility in 2015, DPE has made substantial investments to further \nreduce chloroprene emissions, and current chloroprene emissions from the Facility are now below \napproximately 16 tons per year.   \n30 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 31 of 66\nB.  EPA’s 2010 Toxicological Review Of Chloroprene And Resulting IUR.  \n23.  In September 2010, EPA released the 2010 Review in support of EPA’s IRIS \nassessment of chloroprene.3  In the 2010 Review, EPA concluded that chloroprene was “likely to \nbe carcinogenic to humans” and set one of its most stringent IURs for any hazardous pollutant.  \nSpecifically, EPA calculated an IUR for human exposure to chloroprene of 5 x 10-4 per µg/m3 for \n70-years exposure.  Based on the IUR, EPA issued a memorandum in 2016 stating that the \nchloroprene concentration associated with an incremental lifetime (i.e., 70-year) cancer risk level \nof 1-in-10,000 was 0.2 μg/m3, which the 2016 EPA memorandum generally described as the \n“upper limit of acceptability for purposes of risk-based decisions.”4  As explained below, EPA’s \n“upper limit of acceptability” does not constitute a “bright line” threshold and EPA’s treatment of \nthe 1-in-10,000 value as such, without explanation, is at sharp variance with more than 30 years \nof  EPA  risk  assessment  policy.    As  further  explained  below,  EPA’s  0.2  μg/m3  value  for \nchloroprene is both impracticable to meet and, based on the available science, entirely unnecessary \nto protect human health and the environment. \n24.  In setting that stringent 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene, EPA relied upon a default \nassumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as the female B6C3F1 mouse, which was \nthe most sensitive animal species and gender in the laboratory experiments conducted on the \neffects of exposure to chloroprene.5  However, as the majority of experts participating in the \n                                                 \n3 The 2010 Review can be found at \nhttps://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/iris_documents/documents/toxreviews/1021tr.pdf. \n \n4 See Memo from Kelly Rimer, Leader, Air Toxics Assessment Group, Health & Env’t Impacts \nDiv., OAQPS, to Frances Verhalen, P.E., Chief, Air Monitoring/Grants Section, EPA Region 6, \nRe: Preliminary Risk-Based Concentration Value for Chloroprene in Ambient Air (May 5, 2016). \n \n5 The B6C3F1 mouse is a hybrid strain of mouse that is produced as a cross between other specified \nstrains of mice.  \n31 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 32 of 66\ncontemporaneous peer review of the 2010 Review expressly told EPA at the time, the default \nmouse IUR overestimates human sensitivity to chloroprene.  The female B6C3F1 mouse is three \ntimes more sensitive to chloroprene than the male B6C3F1 mouse and many times more sensitive \nthan every other type of animal that has been tested, including hamsters, Wistar rats, and Fischer rats, \nall of which are commonly used in laboratory studies of industrial chemicals and all of which have \nbeen  utilized  in  laboratory  experiments  involving  chloroprene.    For example,  at  any  given \nconcentration, the response and estimated risk for the female B6C3F1 mouse was from 6 to 160 \ntimes greater  than the Fischer rat.  Other  rodent  species  showed  virtually  no  response  to \nchloroprene.  Indeed, even the male B6C3F1 mouse showed drastically lower effects from \nchloroprene exposure than the female B6C3F1 mouse.  No species except the female B6C3F1 \nmouse supports the 0.2 μg/m3 value.   \n25.  In short, because of the substantial toxicokinetic (i.e., how the body handles a \nchemical, as a function of dose and time) differences between the female B6C3F1 mouse and \nhumans—differences that EPA was aware of but did not account for in its calculation of the IUR—\nthe 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene dramatically overstates the human cancer risks associated with \nexposure to chloroprene.  Further, the most important epidemiological studies of chloroprene that \nwere available in 2010 were studies of U.S. chloroprene workers prepared in 2007 by Dr. Gary \nMarsh, PhD  (Marsh, et al. 2007a, 2007b).6  Dr. Marsh’s 2007 studies involved, among other \nthings, an analysis of chloroprene exposure at the Facility and showed no relationship between \n                                                 \n \n6 See Marsh GM, Youk AO, Buchanich JM, Cunningham M, Esmen NA, Hall TA, Phillips ML.  \n2007b.

In December 2015, EPA published a National Air Toxics Assessment, or NATA, \nbased on reported emissions from industrial facilities in 2011 (“2011 NATA”).  In general, EPA \nuses NATAs to identify and prioritize air toxics that EPA believes contribute to health risks.  In \nthe 2011 NATA, EPA relied upon on the IUR for chloroprene from the 2010 Review—i.e., the \nchloroprene risk assessment based solely on the female B6C3F1 mouse—as well as on data \nregarding chloroprene emissions from the Facility during 2011 and other data.  In the 2011 NATA, \nEPA suggested that there was a high risk of cancer due to chloroprene exposure in St. John the \nBaptist Parish in the vicinity of the Facility.  Indeed, EPA stated that “[t]he top 5 census tracts with \nthe highest NATA-estimated cancer risks nationally are in Louisiana due to Denka (formerly \nDuPont) chloroprene emissions.”8 \n                                                 \n7  As discussed further below, Dr. Marsh performed a major follow-up epidemiological study in \n2021, which provided an update through 2017 regarding the cohort of chloroprene workers that \nwas the subject of Dr. Marsh’s 2007 study.  The updated 2021 Marsh study showed no increase in \ncancer mortalities among U.S. chloroprene workers.  See Marsh GM, Kruchten A, Buchanich JM. \nMortality Patterns Among Industrial Workers Exposed to Chloroprene and Other Substances: \nExtended Follow-Up. J Occup Environ Med. 2021 Feb 1;63(2):126-138.  \n \n8  EPA,  LaPlace,  Louisiana  –  Frequent  Questions  (Mar.  29,  2022),  available  at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/la/laplace-louisiana-frequent-questions (emphasis added). \n \n33 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 34 of 66\nC.  The 2010 Review Was Scientifically Flawed And EPA Knew It.  \n27.  EPA’s conclusions in the 2010 Review are scientifically flawed.  Prior to issuing \nthe 2010 Review, EPA consulted with a group of experts in toxicology9 and epidemiology10 to \nconduct a peer review of the 2010 Review.  These experts included Dr. Herman J. Gibb, Ph.D., \nM.P.H., an epidemiologist; Dr. Avima M. Ruder, Ph.D., an epidemiologist; Dr. Ronald L. Melnick, \nPh.D., a toxicologist; Dr. John B. Morris, Ph.D., a toxicologist; Dr. Richard B. Schlesinger, Ph.D., \na toxicologist; and Dr. Dale Hattis, Ph.D., a statistician.  Notably, EPA believes that the 2010 “peer \nreview is presumptive of objectivity and ‘best available’ science at the time it was developed.”  \nLetter from Dr. Maureen R. Gwinn to Mr. Patrick Walsh at 1 (Mar. 14, 2022) (“2022 Request for \nReconsideration Denial”).  \n28.   The peer review of the 2010 Review raised sharp criticisms of EPA’s methods and \nconclusions in the 2010 Review.  Four of the six peer reviewers raised concerns that basing human \nrisk values on the female B6C3F1 mouse would overestimate chloroprene’s cancer risk to humans.  \nFor example, Dr. Morris, a toxicologist, stated that “[i]t is my view that the mouse lung data may \noverestimate the risk to humans.  It is recognized that exclusion of these data may be problematic, \nbut at a minimum a discussion of this weakness should be provided.  Because the metabolism rates \nin the rat appear similar to the human, the rat may offer a better species for prediction of human \nhealth risks.”  Final Reviewer Comments, External Peer Review Meeting on the Toxicological \nReview of Chloroprene, at 30 (Jan. 26, 2010) (“2010 Final Reviewer Comments”) (emphasis \n                                                 \n9  The National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) describes toxicology as a field of science that helps \nus understand the harmful effects that chemicals, substances, or situations, can have on people, \nanimals, and the environment. \n \n10  NIH defines epidemiology as the branch of medical science that investigates all the factors that \ndetermine the presence or absence of diseases and disorders. \n34 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 35 of 66\nadded).  Dr. Ruder, an epidemiologist, observed that “[t]he text in [the 2010 Review] explains the \nderivation of the inhalation risk but does not explain why inhalation in mice was chosen over \ninhalation in rats from the same study.  I assume there are physiological differences which make \nmice a more suitable choice, but none were provided here.”  Id. at 31 (emphasis added).  Similarly, \nDr. Schlesinger, a toxicologist, warned that EPA “may want to consider the fact that metabolic \nactivation rate in the rat is closer to that occurring in humans than is the situation in mice.”  Id.   \n29.  Most of the peer reviewers recognized the need to adjust the IUR for the female \nB6C3F1 mouse to reflect human sensitivity.  Dr. Morris, a toxicologist, provided several sharply \nworded  comments  recognizing  the  important  differences  between  human  response  and  the \nresponse of the female B6C3F1 mouse: \n  “[I]n my view, some skepticism is appropriate relative to the quantitative \nimportance of mouse bronchiolar tumors.  The mode of action includes \nmetabolic activation as the first step.  The metabolic activation rates in the \nmouse exceed those in other species by 50-fold.  . . . The large differences \nin mouse vs. human relative to pulmonary activation raise questions as to \nthe relevance of the mouse lesions.  At the very least, this issue needs to be \ndiscussed.  Exclusion of the mouse lung tumors would influence the final \noverall unit risk estimate indicating this is not a trivial concern.”  2010 Final \nReviewer Comments at 40. \n  “The mouse  –  human  comparison  for lung  metabolism  is  particularly \nimportant, a fact that was not adequately considered in the risk evaluation. \nThe presented data indicate the activity in human lung is 50-fold lower than \nin mouse lung . . . .  The liver activities in the mouse and man are much more \nsimilar.  Since metabolic activation is the first step in the mode of action and \nlung tumors in mice drives the risk extrapolation, this comparison becomes \nparticularly important. . . . [T]his type of species difference (mouse to \nhuman  pulmonary  metabolism)  is  hardly  unique  to  chloroprene.    For \nexample, consider styrene.”  Id. at 47. \n  “More  detail  should  be  provided  on  the  metabolism  kinetics  for \nchloroprene. . . .  The relative level of metabolite 1 in the humans was \napproximately 10-fold lower than the F344 rat and mouse. The level of \nmetabolite in the Wistar rat and hamster was lower as well.  Were these \nquantitative differences synthesized into a coherent explanation of species \ndifferences in response?”  Id. at 57. \n35 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 36 of 66\n  “This section fails to include the most important species difference – the \nappearance of lung tumors in mice but not rats.  An in situ [sic] pulmonary \nmetabolic basis might be provided, given that the metabolic activation rate \nin mice appears to be 50-fold higher than the rat but that in the liver differs \nby only 2-fold.”  Id. at 59-60. \n  “[M]agnitude of species difference in metabolism is not unique, consider \nstyrene or naphthalene.  One might convincingly argue that the enormous \nmetabolic activation  rate  in  the  mouse  coupled  with  the  low  epoxide \nhydrolysis rate renders this species inappropriate relative to extrapolation \nof lung tumors.  The authors of the [2010 Review] may not agree, but a \ncritical discussion and rationale for using the mouse data needs to be \nincluded.”  Id. at 62. \n30.  Notably,  panel  members  emphasized  that  EPA  should  develop  and  utilize  a \nphysiologically-based pharmacokinetic (“PBPK”) model, which is a specialized computer model \nthat is specifically designed to make adjustments in risk assessments based upon the different \ntoxicological effects of a chemical from one species to another—for example, the differences \nbetween a female B6C3F1 mouse and a human.  Panel members emphasized that a PBPK model \nfor chloroprene would allow EPA to interpret laboratory animal tumor incidence data and apply \nthat data to human beings, while considering the significant physiological differences between \nmice, rats, and humans.  For example, Dr. Morris, a toxicologist, stated: “[T]he toxicokinetic data \nis not adequately synthesized in the overall mode of action relative to potential species differences \nand extrapolation to man.  PBPK modeling would be a highly appropriate way to incorporate \nkinetic data into the risk assessment.”  Id. at 6.   \n31.  In sum, the peer reviewers of the 2010 Review raised substantial concerns that the \nIUR applicable to the female B6C3F1 mouse was decidedly inappropriate for assessing the risks \nof chloroprene exposure to humans, and that EPA should actively develop a PBPK model to \ncorrectly assess how animal risk studies translate into potential human risk. \n32.  In  light  of  these  criticisms  by  the  2010  peer  reviewers,  EPA  should  have \nreexamined its myopic reliance on the tumor incidence rate in the B6F3C1 female mouse and \n36 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 37 of 66\neither based its cancer risk assessment on the tumor incidence rate in the rats (as several peer \nreviewers suggested) or pursued the development of a PBPK model.  But EPA rejected the \nchloroprene PBPK model that was available at that time, concluding that the model was not \nadequate  for  certain  technical  reasons.    As  explained  below,  although  EPA  subsequently \nencouraged DPE to develop an improved PBPK model, which DPE did in consultation with EPA, \nEPA ultimately refused to consider that new and improved PBPK model—not because of any \nshortcoming in the new PKBK model, but because EPA, under a new Administration, now took \nthe position that the Agency was not required to consider the latest and best available science on \nchloroprene.   \n33.  The  2010  peer  review  also  strongly  criticized  EPA’s  misuse  of  the  relevant \nepidemiological data in the 2010 Review.  Dr. Gibb, one of only two epidemiologists conducting \nthe 2010 peer review, concluded that EPA “grossly misrepresents the evidence.”  Referring to \nEPA’s reliance on prior epidemiological studies in Kentucky, Louisiana, China, Russia, and \nArmenia, Dr. Gibb stated: “The statement [by EPA] … that there is evidence of a dose-response \nrelationship in different cohorts in different continents (U.S., China, Russia, and Armenia) grossly \nmisrepresents the evidence.”  2010 Final Reviewer Comments at 25.  For example, Dr. Gibb \nexplained that high alcohol consumption in Russia and wide prevalence of Hepatitis B in China—\nboth known risk factors for liver cancer mortality—were “confounding factors” that undermined \nthe connection between chloroprene and cancer risk.  Id. at 27.  \n34.  Dr. Gibb also criticized EPA’s attempt to justify its decision not to rely on more \nrobust existing epidemiological studies of chloroprene workers in the United States and the United \nKingdom, in particular a leading epidemiological study of U.S. chloroprene workers prepared by \nDr. Gary Marsh, Ph.D., in 2007.  EPA discounted these studies because it believed that the so-\n37 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 38 of 66\ncalled “healthy worker effect” accounted for the lack of connection between chloroprene exposure \nand cancer risk.  EPA explained that the healthy worker effect “tends to reduce the association \nbetween  an  exposure  [chloroprene  inhalation]  and  the  outcome  [cancer  mortality]  because \nworkers, as a group, are healthier than the general population comparison groups.”  2022 RFR \nDenial, App. A, EPA Courtesy Technical Review of New Scientific Information Presented in RFC \n21005, at 8.  EPA used its theory on the healthy worker effect selectively to disregard existing \nstudies that suggested that chloroprene posed little to no additional cancer risk.  Dr. Gibb noted in \nhis peer review comments that “[a]n association between liver cancer and chloroprene exposure \n. . . is not evident in the summary of the overall weight of evidence . . . . Furthermore, a healthy \nworker effect for liver cancer?  With such a short life expectancy following diagnosis, I would \nexpect the healthy worker effect for liver cancer to be minimal if it even exists.”  2010 Final \nReviewer Comments at 27.  Finally, referring to Dr. Marsh’s 2007 study of chloroprene workers \nin Louisville, Kentucky, Dr. Gibb noted that “[t]he largest and what appears from the [draft 2010 \nReview] to be the best conducted study (Marsh et al., Louisville cohort) provides little if any \nevidence that a liver cancer risk exists.  Furthermore, the [draft 2010 Review] has not been \ntransparent in its reasoning that there is a risk of liver cancer.”  Id. \n35.  In response to Dr. Gibb’s peer review comments, EPA changed the language in the \ndraft 2010 Review from “risk of liver cancer mortality is reasonably consistent and there is some \nevidence of an exposure-response relationship” (2009 Draft Review at 4-18 (emphasis added)) to \n“increased risk of liver cancer mortality is fairly consistent and there is some suggestive evidence \nof an exposure-response relationship.”  2010 Review at 42 (emphasis added).  In other words, EPA \nmade only superficial changes to the text of the 2010 Review—none of which could have changed \nthe IUR or the resulting 0.2 μg/m3 value. \n38 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 39 of 66\n36.  EPA attempted to respond to these comments by comparing the estimated number \nof excess cancer cases from the IUR to the cancer mortality rate in the leading epidemiological \nstudies, but committed two clear errors due to simple, but consequential mistakes. See 2010 \nReview, Appendix A, page A-17.  EPA purported to show that the number of lung- and liver-\nrelated cancer deaths were similar between the actual cohort in the Marsh et al., (2007a, 2007b) \nstudy (283) and an estimate based on the 2010 Review IUR, adjusted for similar exposure and \npopulation parameters (293). EPA’s first error in developing its mortality estimate for the 2010 \nReview IUR was using the wrong IUR based on the male B6C3F1 mouse.  EPA’s second error \nwas that it applied the incorrect IUR only to the occupational cohort of known causes of death \n(n=2,282) when all workers in the cohort (n=5,486) were exposed to chloroprene and should have \nbeen included in the analysis.  Both of these errors resulted in a mortality estimate (purportedly \nbased on the 2010 Review IUR) that was significantly lower than it should have been. Instead of \nan estimated excess cancer mortality of 293, the correct calculation should have been 927.  EPA’s \nerror becomes clear when compared to the 283 cancer mortalities observed in the Marsh study \ncohort: the incorrect estimate of 293 provides the false appearance that the 2010 IUR is consistent \nwith real-world, human data. But, when the corrected IUR estimate of 927 mortalities is compared \nto 283, it is obvious that the IUR is wildly incorrect.  In other words, if the 0.2 μg/m3 value \ntranslated to the real-world, the Marsh study should have found an additional 644 lung- and liver-\nrelated cancer deaths.  EPA also committed a rudimentary error when it did not recognize that the \n283 total lung and liver mortalities was below the expected number of lung and liver cancers in a \nnon-exposed population.  These calculations were not subject to peer review or to comments from \nother agencies or offices of the White House. \n39 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 40 of 66\n37.  What EPA should have recognized in 2010 is that if the IUR were applied to the \nentire exposed worker cohort in Louisville, the female mouse IUR would have led EPA to expect \nthat more than 70% of the workers should have contracted lung and liver cancers. In fact, the \ncohort of workers had a deficit of lung and liver cancer compared to an unexposed population—\ni.e., the workers had less lung and liver cancer, not more.  EPA’s assertion that IRIS values \nrepresent the “gold standard” in toxicology is simply not true. \nD.  DPE’s Initial Request For Correction And EPA’s Denial Of That Request.  \n38.  On June 26, 2017, DPE submitted a Request for Correction (numbered RFC \n#17002) (“2017 Request for Correction”) to EPA, identifying the above-described errors in the \n2010 Review and IUR.  Further, DPE provided EPA with a published version of a PBPK model \nfor chloroprene (Yang, et al., 2012).  DPE also provided EPA with a substantial re-evaluation of \nDr. Marsh’s 2007 epidemiological study of U.S. chloroprene workers, which, as noted above, was \ndescribed by one of the 2010 peer reviewers (Dr. Gibb) as “[t]he largest and what appears from \nthe document to be the best conducted study” of chloroprene risks.  2010 Final Reviewer \nComments at 27. \n39.  Further, DPE’s 2017 Request for Correction identified data from the Louisiana \nTumor Registry indicating that St. John the Baptist Parish, where the Facility is located, recorded \none of the lower cancer rates of any parish in the state.  The Louisiana Tumor Registry, maintained \nby the Louisiana State University School of Public Health, has a mission “[t]o collect and report \ncomplete, high-quality, and timely population-based cancer data in Louisiana to support cancer \nresearch,  control,  and  prevention.”    LSU  Health,  About  the  Registry, \nhttps://sph.lsuhsc.edu/louisiana-tumor-registry/about-the-registry/. \n40 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 41 of 66\n40.  On January 25, 2018, EPA denied DPE’s 2017 Request for Correction on the \ngrounds that, according to EPA, DPE had not provided any “new scientific evidence” that would \nalter the Agency’s assessment of the risks of chloroprene to humans.  In the denial, EPA stated \nrepeatedly that in the absence of new scientific evidence, EPA would continue as a default to rely \non the female B6C3F1 mouse’s sensitivity to chloroprene exposure in setting the human IUR for \nchloroprene.  EPA did acknowledge the importance of a PBPK model in assessing the risks of \nchloroprene to humans but concluded that the then-existing model was not sufficient due to \ntechnical issues.   \n41.  On  July  23,  2018,  DPE  filed  a  request  for  reconsideration  (numbered  RFC \n#17002A)  (“2018  Request  for  Reconsideration”)  of  EPA’s  denial  of  the  2017  Request  for \nCorrection.  \nE.  With EPA’s Support And Active Collaboration, DPE Develops A New PBPK Model.  \n42.  In addition to filing the 2018 Request for Reconsideration, DPE embarked on a \nthree-year  project  to  develop  an  updated  and  peer  reviewed  PBPK  model  for  chloroprene, \nemploying a team of scientists at Ramboll US Consulting, Inc. (“Ramboll”).  DPE did so to \nrespond to EPA’s conclusion in the 2018 denial of the 2017 Request for Correction that any \nchallenge to the IUR must be based on new scientific evidence, and specifically to respond to \nEPA’s acknowledgement that it would be appropriate for EPA to rely upon a new and improved \nPBPK model for chloroprene.    \n43.  Indeed, DPE and EPA actively coordinated to develop a new and improved PBPK \nmodel for chloroprene.  Ramboll prepared a work plan for the development of a PBPK model and, \nin April 2018, provided the draft work plan to EPA for its review and comment.   \n41 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 42 of 66\n44.  On  information  and  belief,  EPA  committed  substantial  resources  to  provide \nRamboll with quality assurance guidance on the development of the PBPK model.  EPA even \npaused its review of DPE’s 2018 Request for Reconsideration for more than two  years to \naccommodate Ramboll’s development of the new and improved PBPK model.  At the very least, \nby pausing its review of DPE’s 2018 Request for Reconsideration, EPA acknowledged the clear \nvalue of DPE developing a new and improved PBPK model to assess the potential risks of \nchloroprene to humans.  Indeed, in meetings and emails between EPA and DPE and Ramboll, EPA \npersonnel repeatedly emphasized that DPE and Ramboll should develop the PBPK model.   \n45.  In June 2019, to ensure that the new PBPK model was correct, Ramboll submitted \nthe PBPK model for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Inhalation Toxicology, and after peer \nreview, the PBPK model was published in January 2020.11     \n46.  In October 2020, EPA itself sponsored an external peer review of an updated version \nof the Ramboll PBPK model.  The 2020 peer review panel provided comments.  By early 2021, \nRamboll had substantively revised the PBPK model to address all the meaningful comments from \nthe EPA-sponsored peer review, making technical changes in the model to provide better fit for \ncross species tumor predictions among laboratory test animals. \n47.  In February 2021, EPA notified DPE that it would be resuming its review of DPE’s \n2018 Request for Reconsideration.  By that time, with EPA’s input and collaboration, including \nthe October 2020 EPA-sponsored peer review, Ramboll had substantially updated the PBPK model \nfor chloroprene in accordance with EPA’s quality assurance comments at each stage of the \n                                                 \n11 Clewell HJ 3rd, Campbell JL, Van Landingham C, Franzen A, Yoon M, Dodd DE, Andersen \nME, Gentry PR. 2020, Incorporation of in vitro metabolism data and physiologically based \npharmacokinetic modelling in a risk assessment for chloroprene, Inhalation Toxicology. 31(13-\n14):468-483.

As  such,  DPE  elected  to  withdraw  its  pending  2018  Request  for \nReconsideration.  Having now developed (with EPA’s cooperation and consultation) the very new \nscientific evidence that EPA had said was necessary, DPE was prepared to submit a new request \nfor correction of the 2010 Review that would, among other things, highlight the new scientific \ninformation that was now available in the form of the Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene.  \nF.  DPE’s Second Request For Correction.  \n48.  On July 15, 2021, DPE filed its second Request for Correction (numbered RFC \n#21005) (“2021 Request for Correction”) requesting correction of the chloroprene IUR based, in \npart, on Ramboll’s new and improved PBPK model for chloroprene.  \n49.  Surprisingly, given EPA’s prior cooperation and quality assurance input in the \ndevelopment of the new Ramboll PBPK model, almost immediately after DPE submitted the 2021 \nRequest for Correction, EPA personnel abruptly ceased all substantive communications with DPE \nregarding the Ramboll PBPK model or any appropriate revisions to the IUR based on that model.  \n50.  However, unbeknownst to DPE, EPA sponsored another independent peer review \nof the new Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene.  Unlike the 2020 EPA-sponsored external peer \nreview, this follow-up peer review was conducted secretly and without giving Ramboll the \nopportunity to address any questions from the peer review panel.  Nonetheless, the follow-up peer \nreview demonstrated that Ramboll had successfully addressed most of the comments on prior \nversions of the PBPK model, and EPA’s contractor provided Ramboll with a few additional \ncomments that Ramboll believed it could promptly address in a final version of the model.  EPA \ndid not require a consensus recommendation for the use of the Ramboll PBPK model and none \nwas provided.  On balance, the peer reviewers considered the Ramboll PBPK model to be ready \nfor use. \n43 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 44 of 66\n51.  In addition to providing EPA with the new Ramboll PBPK model, DPE’s 2021 \nRequest for Correction also provided EPA with a major new follow-up epidemiological study \nconducted by Dr. Marsh (Marsh, et al. 2021).  Dr. Marsh’s new study provided an update through \n2017 regarding the cohort of U.S. chloroprene workers that was the subject of Dr. Marsh’s 2007 \nstudy (Marsh, et al. 2007a, 2007b).  The updated 2021 Marsh study showed no increase in cancer \nmortalities among U.S. chloroprene workers.    \n52.  Further, DPE provided EPA with the updated data from the Louisiana Tumor \nRegistry, which, consistent with previous Registry data, indicated lower cancer incidence rates in \nSt. John the Baptist Parish compared to the state average.  The updated 2021 Marsh study included \na figure from the Louisiana Tumor Registry website indicating that the cancer incidence rate in St. \nJohn the Baptist Parish was below the state average for the 2012-2016 period. (Marsh, et al. 2021 \nat 10).  A study by Louisiana State University in 2020-2021 confirmed that the Louisiana Tumor \nRegistry had not omitted relevant cancer cases in the 2009-2018 timeframe. Cancer Surveillance \nProject,  Cancer  Reporting  in  St.  John  Parish  3  (2021),  https://louisianacancer.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/03/CRISP-Final-Report.pdf.    A  recent  update  of  the  Louisiana  Tumor \nRegistry for the 2015-2019 period also reported that St. John the Baptist Parish was within the \nbottom 25 percent of cancer incidence rates in Louisiana.  LSU Health, Louisiana Cancer Data \nVisualization,  https://sph.lsuhsc.edu/louisiana-tumor-registry/data-usestatistics/louisiana-data-\ninteractive-statistics/louisiana-cancer-data-visualization/ (last visited Jan. 3, 2023). \n53.  Like Dr. Marsh’s updated epidemiological data, the Louisiana Tumor Registry data \nstrongly support the conclusion that chloroprene does not pose a meaningful risk to humans.  Given \nthe decades-long history of chloroprene emissions from the Facility (the vast majority of which \nwas under DuPont’s ownership and at concentrations more than an order of magnitude higher than \n44 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 45 of 66\ncurrent emissions), if EPA’s 2010 IUR were remotely accurate, then there would be a statistically \nsignificant increase in cancer rates shown in the Louisiana Tumor Registry for St. John the Baptist \nParish, and there would be thousands of excess cancer mortalities in the chloroprene worker cohort \ncovered by Dr. Marsh’s updated 2021 epidemiological study.  But the empirical data from the \nLouisiana Tumor Registry and Dr. Marsh’s epidemiological study are decidedly to the contrary.  \nThe Louisiana Tumor Registry data show that the incidence of cancers near the Facility are at or \nbelow state-wide averages of cancers of potential concern.  The updated 2021 Marsh study showed \nno increase in cancer mortalities among U.S. chloroprene workers. \nG.  EPA Rejects DPE’s 2021 Request For Correction, But For A Different And Invalid Reason.  \n \n54.  On March 14, 2022, EPA denied DPE’s 2021 Request for Correction.  On its face, \nEPA’s alleged justification for denying the 2021 Request for Correction was a complete reversal \nfrom EPA’s prior denial of the 2017 Request for Correction.  As described above, in denying the \n2017 Request for Correction, EPA had taken the position that the 2010 Review (and resulting IUR) \ncould only be changed based on the submission of new scientific evidence.  In the 2021 Request \nfor  Correction,  DPE  did  precisely  that  by  providing  the  new  Ramboll  PBPK  model  for \nchloroprene, further analysis regarding the updated epidemiological study by Dr. Marsh, and \nepidemiological data from the Louisiana Tumor Registry.  Now, however, in denying the 2021 \nRequest for Correction, EPA took the position that it had no obligation to update the 2010 Review \nbased on new scientific evidence, arguing that new scientific information could only be considered \nif two conditions were met: (1) chloroprene was nominated as a national or regional priority, and \n(2) EPA accepted the nomination.   \n55.  Unbeknownst to DPE at the time, in April 2021, EPA Region 6 did nominate \nchloroprene for IRIS review specifically to revisit the IUR.  EPA’s denial of the 2021 Request for \n45 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 46 of 66\nCorrection failed to consider or disclose the nomination which could have re-opened consideration \nof the IUR and undermined EPA’s significant policy initiatives targeting DPE.  DPE was not aware \nof  the  nomination  until  2023,  when  that  information  was  revealed  through  a  Freedom  of \nInformation Act request.  EPA’s denial of the 2021 Request for Correction is arbitrary and \ncapricious because of EPA’s failure to adequately explain, or even address, why the nomination \nwas not accepted despite DPE’s persistent actions to update the IUR based on updated information. \n56.  In addition, EPA’s denial of the 2021 Request for Correction faults DPE for “not \nidentifying errors in the 2010 IRIS assessment.”  2022 Denial at 1.  In other words, after EPA \ndenied the 2017 Request for Correction for not providing new scientific information, EPA now \ntook the position that the 2021 Request for Correction could not be granted because DPE had \nprovided new scientific evidence.  Quite simply, EPA created a “Catch-22” scenario where no \nrevision of an IUR is possible without new scientific evidence, but new scientific evidence will not \nbe permitted to change the IUR.  In short, EPA arbitrarily and capriciously changed its policy for \nconsidering new scientific information as set out in the 2018 denial of the 2017 Request for \nCorrection without reasoned explanation. \n57.  In denying the 2021 Request for Correction, EPA attempted to insulate itself from \njudicial scrutiny by providing what it characterized as a “courtesy technical review” of DPE’s new \nscientific evidence.  With a wave of the hand EPA concluded, incorrectly, that even if the new \nRamboll PBPK model were appropriate for use for tumor incidence in the lung, in a full risk \nassessment with the consideration of multiple organs as possible tumor sites, the 2010 IUR would \nbe reduced within a factor of two with the corrected value.  EPA said, “[t]his factor of 2 difference \nis well within the generally accepted uncertainty for cancer risk estimation.” 2022 Denial at 7.  \nEPA apparently reasoned that the Ramboll PBPK model addresses only lung tumors, when in fact \n46 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 47 of 66\nit also provides risk values for the liver.  Using the PBPK values and a full assessment, EPA would \nhave concluded that the 2010 IUR overstates human risk by at least a factor of 35.  Based on its \nflawed “courtesy” analysis, however, EPA stated that 2010 IUR was in reasonable agreement with \npotential adjustments using the Ramboll PBPK model.  In addition, the 2022 denial of the 2021 \nRequest for Correction rejected the conclusiveness of new follow-up epidemiological study by Dr. \nMarsh and the Louisiana Tumor Registry data. \n58.  On June 10, 2022, DPE submitted to EPA a Request for Reconsideration of the \ndenial of the 2021 Request for Correction (“2022 Request for Reconsideration”).  DPE reiterated \nall of EPA’s errors in the 2010 Review and DPE’s arguments and evidence set forth in the 2017 \nRequest for Correction and the 2021 Request for Correction, and DPE urged EPA to reconsider its \nrejection of the highly relevant scientific information previously requested by EPA and presented \nin the 2021 Request for Correction, including the Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene.  \n59.  On October 19, 2022, EPA denied DPE’s 2022 Request for Reconsideration, \nthereby affirming EPA’s denial of the 2021 Request for Correction.  In its denial, EPA reaffirmed \nthat it has no duty to update the 2010 Review based on current scientific information, stating:  \n“EPA’s  Information  Quality  Guidelines  recognize that  scientific  knowledge about  chemical \nhazards and risk changes and may need to be updated over time.  However, the [request for \ncorrection] process is not a mechanism to commit EPA to undertake scientific updates of its risk \nassessment products, such as IRIS Toxicological Reviews.”  EPA’s denial of the 2022 Request for \nReconsideration was a final agency action because it marks the consummation of EPA’s decision-\nmaking process from which legal consequences are presently impacting DPE, most acutely \nthrough EPA’s ISE Action in this Court, which takes the unprecedented step of alleging that \n47 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 48 of 66\nemergency authority under the Clean Air Act (not permitting or rulemaking authority) should be \nexercised by the Court to impose further emission reductions. \nH.  EPA’s Actions To Enforce The 0.2 μg/m3 Value Against DPE.  \n60.  EPA’s position on enforcing the 0.2 μg/m3 value as a requirement for chloroprene \nhas undergone a clear change since EPA published the 2011 NATA in December 2015.  For \nexample, in June 2016 EPA, six months after publishing the 2011 NATA, EPA issued an “Action \nPlan” to DPE and expressed its intent to “collect and evaluate site-specific information” regarding \nchloroprene emissions.  See Action Plan, Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC – Pontchartrain \nFacility (formerly the DuPont Neoprene Facility, Pontchartrain Works) LaPlace, St. John the \nBaptist Parish, Louisiana, June 2016, at 1.  At that time, however, EPA expressly recognized that \nthe 2011 NATA should not be used “to identify actual exposures and associated risks to specific \nindividuals.”  Id.  In other words, EPA at that time conceded there was no basis to apply 0.2 μg/m3 \nas a requirement for chloroprene emissions at the Facility.  As Judge Martin Feldman stated in \nButler v. Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC,  No. 18-CV-6685, 2020 WL 2747276, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 91998, *30-32 (E.D. La. May 27, 2020) (Feldman, J.) (quoting EPA.gov), aff’d in \npart on other grounds, 16 F.4th 427 (5th Cir. 2021), the 0.2 µg/m3 value is “less than a federal \nregulation,” “was not designed to pinpoint specific risk values at local levels like St. John the \nBaptist Parish,” and that even the EPA “disclaims” it as an “absolute risk measure of a risk from \nair toxins.”    \n61.  From  June  6-10,  2016,  EPA’s  National  Environmental  Investigations  Center \n(“NEIC”) performed a compliance investigation of the Facility.  See NEIC Focused Clean Air Act \nCompliance Investigation Report, October 2016, at 4.  In so doing, EPA gained further information \nabout the Facility’s operations, including chloroprene emissions. \n48 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 49 of 66\n62.  In January 2017, EPA, LDEQ, and DPE worked together to facilitate the reduction \nof chloroprene emissions from the Facility.  In January 2017, LDEQ and DPE, with EPA’s \nguidance and support, executed an Administrative Order on Consent, pursuant to which DPE \nvoluntarily reduced chloroprene emissions from the Facility by 85 percent.  To achieve these \nemission reductions, DPE installed a regenerative thermal oxidizer and other emissions control \nequipment, at a cost of approximately $35 million.  In May 2020, LDEQ determined that DPE had \nachieved the agreed-upon 85 percent emission reductions in accordance with the Administrative \nOrder on Consent .  \n63.  On  April  24,  2018,  EPA  presented  its  findings  from  the  June  2016  NEIC \ncompliance investigation, commencing negotiations between EPA and DPE to resolve such \nfindings.  \n64.  In September 2019, the Director of EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and \nStandards informed LDEQ by letter that the 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene exposure “is not based \non an evaluation of current, real world exposures, is not an air quality standard, and it is not used \ndirectly for regulatory purposes.  Furthermore, the risks calculated using the [IUR], such as 100-\nin-1-million, is not a ‘bright line’ for determining whether a risk level is considered safe or \nacceptable.”  Letter from P. Tsirigotis (EPA) to Dr. C. Brown (LDEQ), dated Sept. 23, 2019, at 2.  \nIn other words, as of September 2019, EPA confirmed that 0.2 μg/m3 was not a “bright line” \nstandard for determining risk.  EPA further acknowledged that, “in setting emission standards \nunder the Clean Air Act, risk is one factor that we need to consider, along with information on \ncosts, energy, safety, control technologies, and other relevant factors.  And there are many other \nfactors.”  Id.  However, EPA would soon change that position.  Upon information and belief, EPA \ndid so for political reasons, and not based on any consideration of the latest available science. \n49 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 50 of 66\n65.  When  President  Biden  took  office  in  January  2021,  he  made  clear  that \n“environmental justice” was one of his Administration’s highest priorities.  President Biden issued \nExecutive Order 14008, establishing the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council, \nthe  White  House  Environmental  Justice  Advisory  Council,  and  the  “Justice40  Initiative.”12   \nTogether, these initiatives are designed to identify and advance environmental justice priorities \nacross numerous government agencies and ensure that 40 percent of the benefits of federal \ninvestments in clean energy are realized in environmental justice communities.  The executive \norder  also  specifically  orders  the  Administrator  of  EPA  to  “strengthen  enforcement  of \nenvironmental violations” throughout underserved communities.  Id.   \n66.  Beginning in 2016, based on the 2010 Review, EPA publicly communicated 0.2 \nμg/m3 as the chloroprene concentration level associated with a cancer risk of 1-in-10,000, the risk \nlevel generally used by EPA as the “the upper limit of acceptability for purposes of risk-based \ndecisions.”  See supra n. 4.  As a result of those warnings, a group of neighborhood activists in St. \nJohn the Baptist Parish have adopted the slogan “only 0.2 will do,” and numerous toxic tort \nlawsuits have been filed against DPE either asking the court to order DPE to ensure that off-site \nconcentrations of chloroprene be reduced to below 0.2 μg/m3 or seeking monetary damages to \ncompensate the plaintiffs for the fear of contracting cancer after being exposed above the 0.2 μg/m3  \nlevel.  Notably, roughly 99% of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits do not allege contracting cancer \ndue to chloroprene emissions from the Facility.  \n                                                 \n12  See  Exec.  Order  on  Tackling  the  Climate  Crisis  at  Home  and  Abroad  (Jan.  27,  2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-\ntackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/.   \n \n50 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 51 of 66\n67.  On May 6, 2021, Earthjustice and other environmental activists petitioned EPA to \ntake emergency action under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act and declare that DPE’s Facility was \npresenting an imminent and substantial endangerment.  The petition alleged that emergency action \nwas warranted due air monitoring results showing chloroprene concentration levels in excess of \n0.2 μg/m3.  Despite those allegations of an emergency made almost two years ago, EPA did not \ndeclare an imminent and substantial endangerment. \n68.  In November 2021, EPA Administrator Regan conducted an unprecedented and \nhighly publicized “Journey to Justice Tour” of the American South.  Administrator Regan visited \nSt. John the Baptist Parish and communities in LaPlace, Louisiana in the vicinity of the Facility.  \nAdministrator Regan met with activists in the community who had brought toxic tort lawsuits \nagainst DPE seeking damages for alleged harms due to chloroprene emissions and/or the fear of \ncontracting cancer.  On information and belief, the local public’s fear of contracting cancer has \nbeen fomented by EPA’s continued public-facing statements about chloroprene emissions causing \ncancer and the Facility’s emissions causing the “highest NATA-estimated cancer risks nationally.”  \nDuring his visit to the local community, Administrator Regan declined to meet with industry \nrepresentatives. \n69.  On January 24, 2022, Administrator Regan sent a letter to the leadership of DPE’s \njoint venture partners, but not to DPE, referring to his 2021 Journey to Justice Tour and visit to St. \nJohn  the  Baptist  Parish.    Administrator  Regan  referred  to  “the  serious  risks  posed  by  the \nchloroprene  emissions  resulting  from  this  plant’s  neoprene  manufacturing  operations,”  and \nessentially adopted the demands of environmental activists and the plaintiffs in the various toxic \ntort lawsuits pending against DPE.  Administrator Regan insisted that DPE take actions to control \n51 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 52 of 66\nemissions of chloroprene that go far beyond what is required under EPA regulations and the air \npermits issued by LDEQ.     \n70.  Shortly after the Biden Administration took office, the EPA career staff with whom \nDPE and Ramboll had collaborated in developing the new PBPK model abruptly ceased engaging \nin communications with DPE and Ramboll representatives, despite years of cooperation on the \nnew Ramboll PBPK model.  On information and belief, EPA’s obvious change in posture was a \npolitically driven decision and EPA staff were encouraged to refrain from further communications \nwith DPE and Ramboll representatives.  On information and belief, EPA is not willing to consider \nthe new Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene and the other updated information presented by \nDPE  in  the  2021  Request  for Correction  because that  information  undercuts  EPA’s  public \npronouncements about the alleged risks of chloroprene in the community, EPA would be criticized \nby environmental activists and the plaintiffs’ attorneys in the toxic tort lawsuits pending against \nDPE, and that information refutes EPA’s allegation of imminent and substantial endangerment in \nthe ISE Action.  \n71.  Since mid-May 2022, EPA began threatening DPE with an action under Section \n303 of the Clean Air Act, which is triggered by EPA’s “receipt of evidence” of an “imminent and \nsubstantial  endangerment.”    42  U.S.C.  §  7603.   Since  that  time,  EPA  has  demanded  DPE \nimplement substantial emissions control projects with the goal of meeting the 0.2 μg/m3 value.     \n72.  In addition to the demands that EPA has made directly to DPE to meet 0.2 μg/m3, \nEPA has sought to achieve that goal by pressuring LDEQ to enforce 0.2 μg/m3 as a requirement \nagainst the Facility.  On January 20, 2022, the Sierra Club and a neighborhood group filed an \nadministrative complaint with EPA against LDEQ for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act, alleging that LDEQ had discriminated against Black residents of St. John the Baptist \n52 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 53 of 66\nParish  by  subjecting  them  to  disproportionate  air  pollution  from  the  Facility  (“Title  VI \nComplaint”).  The Title VI Complaint alleges that LDEQ has discriminated against these residents \nby, among other things, failing to review and strengthen the air permits issued to the Facility and \nfailing to control chloroprene emissions from the Facility.  \n73.  On April 6, 2022, the EPA External Civil Rights Compliance Office (“ECRCO”) \nnotified LDEQ and LDH that it was accepting for investigation the Title VI Complaint. ECRCO \nhas implemented procedures to attempt to informally resolve the matter with LDEQ.   \n74.  On June 3, 2022, LDEQ responded by letter to ECRCO’s decision to accept the \nTitle VI Complaint.  In the letter, LDEQ stated that “neither the 0.2 µg/m3 exposure concentration \nnor  a  cancer  risk  threshold  of  100-in-1-million  are  an  enforceable  standard  or  applicable \nrequirement under the Title V permitting program.  Rather, chloroprene is regulated. . . pursuant \nto Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.”  LDEQ’s letter also reminded EPA that “it is EPA that bears \nthe responsibility to update control standards for hazardous air pollutants under Section 112 of the \n[Clean Air Act]. . . .”  \n75.  On June 6, 2022, LDH responded by letter to ECRCO’s decision to accept the Title \nVI Complaint.  LDH’s letter described a Parish Council meeting in November 2017 to discuss \nchloroprene concentrations near the Facility.  In response to concerns voiced by members of the \ncommunity, the LDH letter states that the Secretary of LDEQ “explained that 0.2 µg/m3 was not \nan established number.”  The letter also states that Dr. LuAnn White of the Tulane School of Public \nHealth convened “an Expert Panel on chloroprene, which concluded that the situation was not a \npublic health emergency but chloroprene levels should not be as high as they were.”   \n76.  On October 12, 2022, EPA sent a “letter of concern” to LDEQ regarding the Title \nVI  Complaint  (“October  12  Letter”).    The  October  12  Letter  “recommends”  that  LDEQ \n53 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 54 of 66\nimmediately (i) conduct a cumulative impact analysis of the neighboring community; (ii) monitor \narea chloroprene concentrations based on the 0.2 μg/m3 value; (iii) issue renewed air permits to \nthe Facility only “after completion of the cumulative impact analysis”; and (iv) “work to establish \nlimits in Industrial Corridor air permits [including the Facility’s air permits] that, in the aggregate, \nlimit air emissions of carcinogens that have a mutagenic mode of action, including chloroprene.”  \nThe October 12 Letter further states that “[g]iven the long history of exposure in the area, the goal \nis to limit future air emissions of such pollutants to levels consistent with cancer risks below 100-\nin-1  million  (based  on  70  years  of  exposure)  at  sites  where  people  live,  and  to  reduce \nconcentrations of such carcinogens even further if reasonably achievable.”  In other words, EPA’s \ngoal is to require the Facility to meet 0.2 μg/m3 and EPA is effectively pressuring LDEQ to enforce \nthe 0.2 μg/m3 value against the Facility. \n77.  On February 28, 2023, EPA initiated the ISE Action, alleging that the Facility’s \nemissions of chloroprene constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment.  EPA seeks an \norder requiring the Facility to implement emission reduction projects that would result in the \nFacility satisfying the 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene.  \n78.  On March 20, 2023, EPA filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking a \nshutdown of the Facility unless DPE complied with EPA’s host of prescriptive requirements.  In \nthe motion, EPA makes no effort to hide that its unprecedented action is entirely dependent on \nenforcing the 0.2 μg/m3 value. See, e.g., Mem. in Support of Mot. For Preliminary Injunction at 6, \nECF No. 9-2 (“For the relevant health effects of breathing chloroprene, the EPA determined that \nthe average concentration of chloroprene a person may regularly breathe over a 70-year lifetime \nwithout being expected to exceed a 1-in-10,000 risk of contracting chloroprene-linked cancers is \n0.2 μg/m3”); id. at 9 (“monitoring data shows that the communities surrounding Denka’s Facility \n54 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 55 of 66\nare being exposed to long-term average airborne chloroprene levels that are between two and over \nfourteen times greater than 0.2 μg/m3”); id. at 11 (“Even the lowest measured average value for \nDenka’s five closest monitors (out of the six total) is about four times greater than 0.2 μg/m3.”).  \nIndeed, EPA purports to substantiate its claim that current levels of chloroprene at the Facility \n“present unacceptably high cancer risk” using an expert—Dr. John Vandenberg—who specifically \nbases his opinion on the accuracy of the 2010 Review.  Id. at 21 (citing Ex. D, Decl. of Dr. John \nVandenberg). Dr. Vandenberg’s first opinion is that “EPA’s IRIS Assessment is scientifically \naccurate and concludes chloroprene is likely and potent human carcinogen.” Id. at 7 (opinion I).  \nHe also provides a straight-forward calculation that uses the 2010 IUR as an established quantity.  \nId. at 24 (“Cancer risks for inhaled pollutants are calculated by multiplying the ADAF-adjusted \nIUR [provided in the 2010 Review] by the concentration of chloroprene in the air that people are \nexposed to for the duration of exposure and summed across age groups to estimate lifetime cancer \nrisk to a specified amount of a substance.”). \n79.  In  sum,  EPA’s  conduct  here—from  its  denial  of  the  2022  Request  for \nReconsideration through its efforts to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene in the ISE \nAction—constitutes final agency action that is having a direct and harmful impact on DPE.   \nFIRST COUNTERCLAIM CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Counterclaim-Defendants’ Issuance Of The 2010 Review Was Arbitrary, Capricious, An \nAbuse Of Discretion, And Contrary To Law In Violation Of The APA) \n80.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1-79 as if fully set forth herein. \n81.  Counterclaim-Defendants’ issuance and application of the 2010 Review setting a \n0.2 μg/m3 1-in-10,000 risk-based value for chloroprene was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA, because Counterclaim-\n55 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 56 of 66\nDefendants failed to consider the best available scientific data despite concerns raised by qualified \npeer reviewers. \n82.  In  setting  that  IUR  for  chloroprene,  EPA  erroneously  relied  upon  a  default \nassumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as a female B6C3F1 mouse.  This was a \nfundamental error by EPA, as the 2010 peer reviewers of the 2010 Review expressly informed \nEPA at the time.  Because of the substantial toxicokinetic differences between the female B6C3F1 \nmouse and humans—differences which EPA was aware of but did not account for in its calculation \nof the IUR—the IUR dramatically overstates the human cancer risks associated with exposure to \nchloroprene.  EPA knew this and disregarded the scientific information that demonstrated it.  \n83.  The 2010 peer reviewers emphasized to EPA that the IUR applicable to the female \nB6C3F1 mouse was not appropriate for assessing the risks of chloroprene exposure to humans, \nand that EPA should develop an accurate PBPK model to correctly assess how animal risk studies \ntranslate into potential human risk.  EPA was arbitrary and capricious in failing to develop and \nrely upon a PBPK model in issuing the 2010 Review setting the stringent 5 x 10-4 IUR value for \nchloroprene and resulting 0.2 μg/m3 value. \n84.  The  2010  peer  review  also  strongly  criticized  EPA’s  misuse  of  the  relevant \nepidemiological data in the 2010 Review, including the most robust epidemiological studies.  EPA \nwas arbitrary and capricious in refusing to revisit its analysis of the existing epidemiological \nstudies or reconsidering its own analysis of the available data.   \n85.  The above-referenced information constituted the best scientific data available to \nEPA at the time of its decision and relevant to assessing the potential risk of chloroprene to \nhumans.    As  such,  EPA  was  obligated  to  consider  this  information  in  the  2010  Review.  \nCounterclaim-Defendants’ failure to do so, resulting in the setting of a 5 x 10-4 IUR value for \n56 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 57 of 66\nchloroprene and resulting 0.2 μg/m3 value, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \nnot in accordance with law, because Counterclaim-Defendants failed to consider the best available \nscientific data in violation of the APA. \nSECOND COUNTERCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Counterclaim-Defendants’ Denials Of DPE’s Challenges To The 2010 Review Were \nArbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, And Contrary To Law In Violation Of The \nAPA) \n86.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1-85 as if fully set forth herein. \n87.  In DPE’s 2017 Request for Correction, 2018 Request for Reconsideration, 2021 \nRequest for Correction, and 2022 Request for Reconsideration, DPE challenged EPA’s issuance \nof the 2010 Review resulting in the setting of a 5 x 10-4 IUR value for chloroprene.  EPA’s denial \nof DPE’s challenges—affirming the 5 x 10-4  IUR for chloroprene and the resulting 0.2 μg/m3 \nvalue—was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because \nCounterclaim-Defendants failed to consider the best scientific data available to EPA at the time of \nits decision in violation of the APA. \n88.  In the 2017 Request for Correction and 2021 Request for Correction, DPE pointed \nout EPA’s errors in issuing the 2010 Review and setting a 5 x 10-4 IUR value for chloroprene, \nincluding EPA’s flawed reliance on the default assumption that humans are as sensitive to \nchloroprene as a female B6C3F1 mouse.  DPE further pointed out the substantial criticisms of the \n2010 Review by the 2010 peer reviewers, including EPA’s failure to utilize a PBPK model and \nEPA’s misuse of the relevant epidemiological data in the 2010 Review.   \n89.  In rejecting the 2021 Request for Correction and 2022 Request for Reconsideration, \nCounterclaim-Defendants erred and abused their discretion by failing to consider and rely upon \nthe new Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene presented  as part  of  the 2021 Request  for \nCorrection and 2022 Request for Reconsideration.  The Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene—\n57 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 58 of 66\nwhich was fully peer-reviewed, including by EPA’s own sponsored peer review—would allow \nEPA to correctly assess how animal risk studies translate into potential human risk.  The Ramboll \nPBPK study is the best available science to correctly assess how animal risk studies translate into \npotential human risk.  Counterclaim-Defendants erred and abused their discretion by failing to \nfully consider and rely upon the Ramboll PBPK model and by disregarding the Ramboll PBPK \nmodel in rejecting the 2021 Request for Correction and 2022 Request for Reconsideration. \n90.  Further,  in  rejecting  the  2021  Request  for  Correction  and  2022  Request  for \nReconsideration, Counterclaim-Defendants erred and abused their discretion by failing to consider \nand rely upon the most recent and robust epidemiological data, including Dr. Marsh’s 2021 \nepidemiological study showing no increase in cancers among U.S. chloroprene workers, and the \nempirical data from the Louisiana Tumor Registry showing that the incidence of cancers near the \nFacility are at or below state-wide averages of cancers of potential concern.   \n91.  The above-referenced information constitutes the best available scientific data \nrelevant to assessing the potential risk of chloroprene to humans.  As such, Counterclaim-\nDefendants were obligated to consider and rely upon this information in the 2010 Review and \nshould have revisited that information based on the facts and arguments set forth in the 2017 \nRequest for Correction, the 2018 Request for Reconsideration, the 2021 Request for Correction, \nand the 2022 Request for Reconsideration.  Counterclaim-Defendants’ repeated failure to do so, \nresulting in the setting of a 5 x 10-4 IUR value for chloroprene, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, and not in accordance with law, because Counterclaim-Defendants failed to consider \nthe best available scientific data in violation of the APA. \n92.  Counterclaim-Defendants’ current and ongoing application of the 2010 Review to \nDPE through the 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene without providing a rational basis for the \n58 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 59 of 66\nAgency’s failure to consider the best available scientific data—including the Ramboll PBPK \nmodel, Dr. Marsh’s 2021 epidemiology study, and the 2022 Louisiana Tumor Registry data—is \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law in violation of the \nAPA. \nTHIRD COUNTERCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Counterclaim-Defendants’ Abrupt Change Of Position—Refusing To Consider The \nRamboll PBPK Model After Encouraging And Working With DPE To Develop It—Was \nArbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, And Contrary To Law In Violation Of The \nAPA) \n93.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1–92 as if fully set forth herein. \n94.  In denying DPE’s 2017 Request for Correction, EPA stated repeatedly that DPE \nhad failed to provide new scientific evidence to dispute, among other things, EPA’s reliance on \nthe female B6C3F1 mouse in setting the human IUR for chloroprene.  Based on EPA’s articulated \nposition, DPE, through Ramboll, spent three years developing an updated and peer reviewed PBPK \nmodel for chloroprene.      \n95.  EPA actively collaborated with DPE and Ramboll in developing the new and \nimproved Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene.  EPA commented on Ramboll’s work plan for \nthe development of a PBPK model and, on information and belief, EPA committed substantial \nresources to provide Ramboll with quality assurance guidance on the development of the PBPK \nmodel.  In meetings and emails between EPA and DPE and Ramboll, EPA personnel repeatedly \nemphasized that DPE and Ramboll should develop the PBPK model.   \n96.  In June 2019, to ensure that the new PBPK model was correct, Ramboll subjected \nthe PBPK model to a peer review and ultimately published the model.  In October 2020, EPA itself \nsponsored another peer review of an updated version of the Ramboll PBPK model, resulting in \nfurther improvements to the model. \n59 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 60 of 66\n97.  By early 2021, having now developed, with EPA’s collaboration, the very new \nscientific information that EPA had said was necessary to revisit and reassess the IUR for \nchloroprene, DPE submitted the 2021 Request for Correction highlighting the new scientific \ninformation that was now available, including the Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene. \n98.  In rejecting the Ramboll PBPK model as part of the denial of the 2021 Request for \nCorrection and 2022 Request for Reconsideration, Counterclaim-Defendants’ position regarding \nthe model was a complete reversal from the position EPA had taken with respect to the 2017 \nRequest for Correction.  In rejecting the 2017 Request for Correction, EPA faulted DPE for not \nproviding new scientific information.  Now, in rejecting the 2021 Request for Correction and 2022 \nRequest for Reconsideration, Counterclaim-Defendants have taken the position that EPA would \nnot revisit the 2010 Review because DPE had provided new scientific evidence.   \n99.  Counterclaim-Defendants’  abrupt  reversal  of  position  was  not  based  on  the \nevidence, data, or best scientific information available at that time.  Upon information and belief, \nCounterclaim-Defendants’  reversal  was  done  for  political  reasons,  and  not  based  on  any \nconsideration of the best science available at the time. \n100.  Counterclaim-Defendants’  reversal  of  position,  effectively  creating  Catch-22 \nscenario, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, and \nresulted in Counterclaim-Defendants failing to consider the best available scientific data in \nviolation of the APA. \nFOURTH COUNTERCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Counterclaim-Defendants’ Actions To Enforce The IUR For Chloroprene Derived From \nThe 2010 Review, And Refusing To Consider The Best Available Science, Is Arbitrary, \nCapricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, And Contrary To Law In Violation Of The APA) \n101.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1–100 as if fully set forth herein. \n60 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 61 of 66\n102.  Counterclaim-Defendants’  actions  to  enforce  the  0.2  μg/m3  IUR  value  for \nchloroprene against the Facility, including in the pending ISE Action, is arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA, because Counterclaim-\nDefendants have failed to consider the best scientific data available at the time. \n103.  In seeking to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 value against the Facility in the ISE Action, \nCounterclaim-Defendants have erred and abused their discretion by failing to consider and rely \nupon the new Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene.  The Ramboll PBPK study was (and remains) \nthe best available science to correctly assess how animal risk studies translate into potential human \nrisk.  Counterclaim-Defendants erred and abused their discretion by failing to fully consider and \nrely upon the Ramboll PBPK model and by disregarding the Ramboll PBPK model in seeking to \nenforce the 0.2 μg/m3 value against the Facility in the ISE Action.  \n104.  Further, Counterclaim-Defendants have erred and abused their discretion by failing \nto consider and rely upon the most recent and robust epidemiological data, including Dr. Marsh’s \n2021 epidemiological study showing no increase in cancers among U.S. chloroprene workers, and \nthe empirical data from the Louisiana Tumor Registry showing that the incidence of cancers near \nthe Facility are at or below state-wide averages of cancers of potential concern.   \n105.  The above-referenced information constituted the best scientific data available at \nthe  time and  relevant  to  assessing  the potential  risk  of chloroprene to  humans.    As  such, \nCounterclaim-Defendants were obligated to consider and rely upon this information prior to \nengaging in efforts to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene against the Facility, including \nin the ISE Action.  Counterclaim-Defendants’ failure to do so was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, and not in accordance with law, because Counterclaim-Defendants failed to consider \nthe best available scientific data in violation of the APA. \n61 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 62 of 66\n106.  Further, Counterclaim-Defendants have erred and abused their discretion by failing \nto conduct a refined risk assessment—as required by EPA’s own guidelines—before seeking to \nenforce the 0.2 μg/m3 IUR value against the Facility in the ISE Action.  EPA’s theory of imminent \nand substantial endangerment relies on monitoring data that have been collected near the DPE \nFacility from 2016 through 2023.  However, contrary to its own guidelines, EPA has failed to \nrefine its assessment of the risk, despite almost seven years of monitoring.  Instead, EPA assumes \nthat individuals in the community will be exposed to chloroprene emissions 24 hours a day for the \nnext 70 years.  This assumption ignores decades of EPA’s own risk assessment principles, as well \nas common sense.  EPA also ignores that chloroprene concentration levels have decreased \nsignificantly compared to the historical averages it relies upon in alleging an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment.  EPA’s failure to refine its risk assessment—contrary to its own \nguidelines—dramatically overestimates community exposure by relying upon an unrealistically \nconservative estimate.  \n107.  Counterclaim-Defendants’ current and ongoing application of the 2010 Review to \nthe Facility through the 0.2 μg/m3 IUR value for chloroprene without providing a rational basis for \nEPA’s failure to consider the best available scientific data—including the Ramboll PBPK model, \nDr. Marsh’s 2021 epidemiology study, and the 2022 Louisiana Tumor Registry data—is arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA. \nFIFTH COUNTERCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Counterclaim-Defendants’ Reversal Of EPA’s Longstanding Risk Assessment Policy \nWithout Reasoned Explanation Was Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, And \nContrary To Law In Violation Of The APA) \n108.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1–107 as if fully set forth herein. \n62 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 63 of 66\n109.  Counterclaim-Defendants have arbitrarily and capriciously reversed 30 years of \nEPA risk assessment policy without reasoned explanation by treating an estimated 1-in-10,000 \nrisk based on the 2010 IUR in a strict, “bright line” fashion.    \n110.  EPA has a history of setting long-term risk standards greater than 1-in-10,000.  \nUnder Section 112 (f) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f), EPA sets emission standards for \nhazardous air pollutants, such as chloroprene, with a statutorily required “ample margin of safety” \nto protect public health.  EPA regulations have authorized long-term risks of greater than 1-in-\n10,000 in the following regulations: \n  In 1989, EPA established National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants \n(“NESHAPs”)  for  benzene,  54  Fed.  Reg.  38044  (Sept.  14,  1989),  based  on  a  risk \nassessment accepted by Congress and codified in the Clean Air Act in 42 U.S.C. § \n7412(f)(2)(B).  For Coke By-Product Recovery Plant, the benzene NESHAPs authorized a \nmaximum risk of 2-in-10,000. \n \n  In 2005, in the NESHAPs for Coke Oven Batteries, EPA authorized a risk of 2.7-in-10,000.  \nSee 70 Fed. Reg. 19992 (2005). \n \n  In 2006, in the National Perchloroethylene Air Emission Standards for Dry Cleaning \nFacilities, EPA authorized a risk of 2-in-10,000.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 42723 (2006). \n \n  In 2021, in the NESHAPs for Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Residual \nRisk and Technology Review, EPA authorized a risk of 2-in-10,000.  See 85 Fed. Reg. \n49084 (2020). \n \n111.  EPA’s departure from 30 years of Agency risk assessment policy without reasoned \nexplanation was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, in \nviolation of the APA. \nSIXTH COUNTERCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(EPA’s Use Of The 2010 Review As The “Gold Standard” And As An Excuse For Ignoring \nAvailable Scientific Information In Making Air Pollution Risk Assessments Is Arbitrary, \nCapricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, And Contrary To Law In Violation Of The APA) \n112.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1–111 as if fully set forth herein. \n63 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 64 of 66\n113.  In numerous regulatory actions relating to the Facility, including but not limited to \nthe  ISE  Action,  the  NEIC  inspections,  the  Title  VI  Letter  of  Concern,  and  in  numerous \ncommunications with LDEQ and others, EPA has relied on the 2010 IUR as the sole basis for \naction and has ignored all other available scientific information, including the Ramboll PBPK \nModel, the Marsh epidemiology studies, and the Louisiana Tumor Registry data.  \n114.  Under the Clean Air Act, the Information Quality Act, and the APA, EPA has an \naffirmative duty to evaluate available scientific evidence in making risk determinations affecting \nDPE. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nFor the reasons set forth above, DPE respectfully requests that the Court grant the following \nrelief: \n115.  A judicial declaration that Counterclaim-Defendants’ issuance of the 2010 Review \nsetting a 0.2 μg/m3 IUR value for chloroprene, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nand not in accordance with law, because Counterclaim-Defendants failed to consider the best \nscientific data available at that time in violation of the APA. \n116.  A  judicial  declaration  that  Counterclaim-Defendants’  denial  of  DPE’s  2017 \nRequest for Correction, 2021 Request for Correction, and 2022 Request for Reconsideration—\nchallenging the issuance of the 2010 Review setting a 0.2 μg/m3 IUR value for chloroprene—was \narbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  and  not  in  accordance  with  law,  because \nCounterclaim-Defendants failed to consider the best scientific data available at that time in \nviolation of the APA. \n117.  An  order  remanding  the  2010  Review  to  EPA  and  requiring  Counterclaim-\nDefendants to give full consideration to the best available scientific information regarding the \n64 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN   Document 22   Filed 03/28/23   Page 65 of 66\ninhalation unit risk of chloroprene to humans, including the Ramboll PBPK model and the latest \nepidemiological data. \n118.

Regan, Administrator of the EPA.  \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  DPE operates a manufacturing facility in La Place, Louisiana (the “Facility”) that \nuses a chemical called chloroprene to produce Neoprene, a popular synthetic rubber that is used in \na  wide  array  of  products,  including  cars,  adhesives,  medical  devices,  wetsuits,  and  other \napplications.  The Facility is the only Neoprene-producing facility in the United States.   \n2.  In  September  2010,  EPA  released  a  Toxicological  Review  of  Chloroprene \n(“2010 Review”) in which EPA calculated an “inhalation unit risk” (“IUR”) for human exposure \nto chloroprene of 5 x 10-4 per µg/m3 for 70-years continuous exposure (“chloroprene IUR”).  Based \non the chloroprene IUR, EPA later declared that the chloroprene concentration associated with an \nincremental lifetime (i.e., 70-year) cancer risk level of 1-in-10,000 was 0.2 μg/m3. \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  22  ooff  3300\n3.  As described further herein, EPA has historically recognized that IUR values \nshould be used only as a starting point for crafting emissions limits and that, when regulators \ndevelop such limits, they must consider the uncertainty inherent in IUR values along with a broad \nset of health risk measures and information.  In the past, EPA has not used IUR values, by \nthemselves, as a basis for setting regulatory standards.  Congress expressly endorsed EPA’s multi-\nfactor  approach  to  determining  the  acceptability  of  risk  under  Section  112  in  the \n1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(2)(B).  Therefore, EPA has \nalways relied on IUR values as only one component of a broader risk assessment analysis.  \nHowever,  in  2022,  contrary  to  this  long-standing  risk  assessment  protocol,  EPA,  without \nexplanation, abruptly began imposing the 0.2 μg/m3 value derived from the chloroprene IUR as a \nstrict limit for ambient chloroprene concentrations (“0.2 μg/m3 standard”).   \n4.  Even worse, EPA has relied upon the chloroprene IUR to derive the 0.2 μg/m3 \nstandard despite substantial scientific information showing that the chloroprene IUR is based on \nfaulty science.  Specifically, in setting and failing to correct the stringent chloroprene IUR, EPA \n(i) relied upon a default assumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as the female \nB6C3F1 mouse; (ii) established the IUR as the upper 95 percentile of the “central tendency” for \nthe IUR established with the most sensitive species and gender in the laboratory experiments \nconducted on the effects of exposure to chloroprene; (iii)  applied Age Dependent Adjustment \nFactors based on a flawed conclusion that chloroprene has a mutagenic mode of action; and \n(iv) elected not to use a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (“PBPK”) model demonstrating \nthat use of the female B6C3F1 mouse data significantly overstates the carcinogenic risk of \nchloroprene to humans.  EPA’s default assumptions are wrong.  \n-2- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  33  ooff  3300\n5.  EPA’s establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 value as a bright-line standard compounds \nEPA’s scientific errors in setting the chloroprene IUR and continues to impose real harm on DPE.  \nEPA’s unprecedented direct application of the chloroprene IUR to enforce compliance with the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard is arbitrary and capricious because EPA (i) contradicts its own risk assessment \nprotocol; (ii) contradicts its historical policy and practice without explanation; and (iii) fails to \nmeaningfully consider substantial scientific information that shows that the strict limit of 0.2 μg/m3 \nis not necessary to protect human health or the environment.  Further, EPA’s establishment of the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard is ultra vires because EPA may only issue limits on air pollutants pursuant to \nprocedures set forth in the Clean Air Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7607(d); see also 5 U.S.C. §§ 552–553.  EPA acted beyond its authority by directing DPE to \ncomply with an ambient air standard without following these requirements, including notice and \ncomment, and considering EPA’s longstanding risk protocols.  \n6.  To be very clear, DPE strongly supports effective environmental protection for the \nFacility’s neighbors.  Between 2017 and 2020, DPE reduced chloroprene emissions from the \nFacility by 85 percent (from 118 tons per year (“tpy”) to 18 tpy) at a cost to DPE of more than \n$35 million.  See  EPA  and  LDEQ,  Summary  Report:  Air  Monitoring  for  Chloroprene \nConcentrations  near  the  Denka  Performance  Elastomer  LLC  (DPE)  Facility  in  LaPlace, \nLouisiana, May 25, 2016, through July 16, 2020, at 1 (“EPA Summary Report”), available at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/la/denka-air-monitoring-data-summaries (“Since March 2018, following the \nimplementation of emission controls being installed by DPE, chloroprene stack emissions have \nbeen  reduced  by  85%  and  EPA  air  monitoring  data  have  shown  corresponding  significant \nreductions of chloroprene concentrations in the community.”).  Since 2020, DPE has further \nreduced chloroprene emissions from the Facility through a series of emission reduction projects.  \n-3- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  44  ooff  3300\n7.  Rather than address the scientific information in a rulemaking proceeding—in \nwhich EPA would be required to provide a meaningful response to comments by the public, \nincluding DPE—EPA began enforcing the 0.2 μg/m3 standard as an air quality standard.  On \nMay 18,  2022,  the  Director  of  EPA’s  Air  Enforcement  Division,  acting  on  EPA’s  behalf, \ndemanded  that  DPE  take  actions  to  reduce  the  Facility’s  emissions  to  ensure  that  off-site \nconcentrations of chloroprene are lower than 0.2 μg/m3, and threatened DPE that EPA would use \n“all available tools” to compel DPE to adhere to this standard.  As further described herein, during \nthe months that followed, EPA continued to demand compliance with the 0.2 μg/m3 standard, \nwhile using “all available tools” to pressure DPE, both directly and indirectly.  Consistent with \nEPA’s threats, these actions by EPA were designed to coerce DPE to comply with the 0.2 μg/m3 \nstandard.  These coercive actions by EPA, beginning with the May 18, 2022 directive, effectively \nestablished an ambient standard.   \n8.  As alleged below, EPA has followed through on its threats to use “all available \ntools” to compel DPE to comply with the 0.2 μg/m3 standard and continues to do so.  DPE files \nthis amended counterclaim under the Administrative Procedure Act to obtain judicial review of \nEPA’s ultra vires establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  \nTHE PARTIES \n9.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331  because  DPE’s  claims  arise  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  including  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., and the Declaratory Judgment \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02.  Section 702 of the APA waives the government’s defense of sovereign \nimmunity in this matter.  5 U.S.C. § 702; Stockman v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 138 F.3d 144, 152 \nn.13 (5th Cir. 1998).   \n13.  The relief sought herein is authorized by 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706(2) and 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201-02. \n14.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because the \nacts and omissions giving rise to the claims alleged herein harm only one facility in the United \nStates—the DPE Facility—which is located within the boundaries of the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Facility.  \n15.  The Facility is in St. John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana.  The Facility was \noriginally operated by DuPont beginning in 1964.  In 1968, DuPont announced that it would begin \nNeoprene production at the Facility. \n16.  On November 1, 2015, DPE acquired the Neoprene manufacturing operations at \nthe Facility from DuPont, and such operations have been owned and operated by DPE since that \ntime. \n-5- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  66  ooff  3300\n17.  Chloroprene is a key chemical used to produce Neoprene.  According to EPA data, \nDuPont’s operation of the Facility resulted in chloroprene emissions of approximately 500 tons \nper year in 1987.  Between 1987 and 2015, chloroprene emissions from the Facility under \nDuPont’s operation dropped to about 120 tons per year.  Since DPE acquired the Neoprene \nmanufacturing operations at the Facility in 2015, DPE has made substantial investments to further \nreduce chloroprene emissions.   \n18.  Chloroprene is listed as a “hazardous air pollutant” under the Clean Air Act, and \nEPA has regulated chloroprene emissions from the Facility since the mid-1990s.  It is undisputed \nthat the Facility meets the emission standards for chloroprene that EPA has established under the \nClean Air Act. \nB.  EPA’s 2010 Review And Resulting IUR.  \n19.  In September 2010, EPA released the 2010 Review in support of EPA’s Integrated \nRisk  Information  System  (“IRIS”)  assessment  of  chloroprene.1    In  the  2010  Review,  EPA \nconcluded that chloroprene was “likely to be carcinogenic to humans” and set one of the most \nstringent IURs for any hazardous pollutant.  Specifically, EPA calculated an IUR for human \nexposure to chloroprene of 5 x 10-4 per µg/m3 for 70-years exposure.  Based on the chloroprene \nIUR, EPA issued a memorandum in 2016 stating that the chloroprene concentration associated \nwith an incremental lifetime (i.e., 70-year) cancer risk level of 1-in-10,000 was 0.2 μg/m3, which \nthe 2016 EPA memorandum generally described as the “upper limit of acceptability for purposes \n \n1  EPA,  Toxicological  Review  of  Chloroprene:  In  Support  of  Summary  Information  on  the \nIntegrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)  (Sept.  2010),  available  at \nhttps://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/iris_documents/documents/toxreviews/1021tr.pdf. \n-6- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  77  ooff  3300\nof risk-based decisions.”2  Until 2022, EPA had never treated this “upper limit of acceptability” as \na “bright line” threshold.  The fact that EPA, without explanation, is now treating the 1-in-10,000 \nvalue as a strict and enforceable standard is at sharp variance with more than 30 years of EPA risk \nassessment policy.  Based on the available science, EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 standard for chloroprene is \nentirely unnecessary to protect human health and the environment.  \n20.  In December 2015, EPA published a National Air Toxics Assessment, or NATA, \nbased on reported emissions from industrial facilities in 2011 (“2011 NATA”).  In general, EPA \nuses NATAs to identify and prioritize air toxics that EPA believes contribute to health risks for \nfurther assessment and potential agency action.  In the 2011 NATA, EPA relied upon the \nchloroprene IUR as well as on data regarding chloroprene emissions from the Facility during 2011 \nand other data.   \nC.  Prior To 2022, EPA Relied Upon IUR Values As A Non-Determinative Component In \nEstablishing Regulatory Standards. \n21.  EPA reviews and publishes information about the health and environmental effects \nof industrial chemicals in its IRIS assessments, which provide toxicity values for health effects \nresulting from exposure to chemicals.  For many chemicals, one part of this assessment is an IUR \nvalue, which is intended to be an estimate of the increased cancer risk from continuous inhalation \nexposure to a concentration of a particular chemical of 1 µg/m3 for a lifetime.  In theory, an IUR \ncan be multiplied by an estimate of lifetime exposure (in units of µg/m3) to estimate a person’s \nlifetime risk of developing cancer as a result of chemical exposure. \n \n2 See Memo from Kelly Rimer, Leader, Air Toxics Assessment Group, Health & Env’t Impacts \nDiv., OAQPS, to Frances Verhalen, P.E., Chief, Air Monitoring/Grants Section, EPA Region 6, \nRe: Preliminary Risk-Based Concentration Value for Chloroprene in Ambient Air (May 5, 2016). \n-7- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  88  ooff  3300\n22.  Sections 112 and 307 of the Clean Air Act set out the procedures by which EPA \nregulates hazardous air pollutants.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 7412, 7607.  In establishing air emissions \nstandards, EPA is required to  establish a rulemaking docket, publish a notice of proposed \nrulemaking in the Federal Register, and allow any person to submit written comments or other \ndocumentary information in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking.  Id. § 7607(d); see \nalso 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 – 553 (APA).  The Clean Air Act also addresses EPA risk assessment in such \nrulemakings.  In carrying out rulemakings pursuant to Section 112, rather than treating risk values \nsuch as IUR values as “a rigid line for acceptability,” EPA considers risk level along with “a series \nof other health measures and factors.” 54 Fed. Reg. 38044, 38045 (Sept. 14, 1989) (“Benzene \nRule”).  Section 112(f)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act specifically endorsed EPA’s use of risk \nassessment factors as set out in the 1989 Benzene Rule.  42 U.S.C. § 112(f)(2)(B) (endorsing \n54 Fed. Reg. 38044).  \n23.  In  the  Benzene  Rule,  EPA  explained  that  there  is  a  two-step  approach  to \nestablishing emissions standards.  54 Fed. Reg. at 38045.  The first step is to determine an \n“acceptable risk.”  EPA considers risk values (like IURs) that are higher than 1-in-10,000 to be \npresumably—but not conclusively—unacceptable.  But critically, the risk value must be weighed \nagainst other factors to determine acceptability.  Id.  The second step is to set the standards that \nprovide an “ample margin of safety” when considering all health information and other relevant \nfactors such as costs and technological feasibility.  Id.  \n24.  EPA applied the risk assessment protocol as set out in the Benzene Rule in 2005, \nin the NESHAPs for Coke Oven Batteries, see 70 Fed. Reg. 19992 (2005), and in 2006, in the \nNational Perchloroethylene Air Emission Standards for Dry Cleaning Facilities, see 71 Fed. Reg. \n42723 (2006).  In both cases, EPA determined that estimated lifetime cancer risks greater than 1-\n-8- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  99  ooff  3300\nin-10,000 were not only acceptable, but that emission limits allowing a cancer risk of almost 3-in-\n10,000 (for Coke Ovens) and 2-in-10,000 (for Dry Cleaners) protected public health with an ample \nmargin of safety.   \n25.  Most recently, in a residual risk evaluation conducted in 2020 for Miscellaneous \nOrganic  NESHAPs  or  “MON,”  EPA  relied  on  the  Benzene  Rule’s  risk  assessment  policy, \nexplaining: “the [Clean Air Act] expressly preserves the EPA’s two-step process for developing \nstandards to address residual risk and interpret ‘acceptable risk’ and ‘ample margin of safety’ as \ndeveloped in the Benzene NESHAPs.’”  85 Fed. Reg. 49084 (2020).  The first step involves a \ndetermination of “acceptability” based on a “broad set of health risk measures and information.” \nId.  In the second step, EPA also considers “cost and economic impacts of controls, technological \nfeasibility, uncertainties, and many other relevant factors.”  Id.   \n26.  In  sum,  prior  to  2022,  EPA  treated  IUR  values  as  only  one  component  in \nestablishing regulatory standards, not as bright-line regulatory limits in and of themselves, and \nnever imposed a regulatory limit based solely on an IUR value.  \n27.  EPA’s website contains a page describing EPA’s IRIS program.  It states that the \nIUR is a value that “estimate[s] increased cancer risk from inhalation exposure to a concentration \nof 1 µg/m3 for a lifetime.”3  EPA’s website further states:  \nRisk assessment is a four-step process described by the National Research \nCouncil (NRC) in 1983 as ‘the characterization of the potential adverse health \neffects  of  human  exposures  to  environmental  hazards.’  Characterizing  risk \ninvolves integrating information on hazard, dose-response, and exposure.  An \nIRIS assessment includes the first two steps of the risk assessment process: \nHazard Identification [and] Dose-Response Assessment.   \n \n3  See  EPA,  Basic  Information  about  the  Integrated  Risk  Information  System,  available  at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/iris/basic-information-about-integrated-risk-information-system;  see  also \nEPA,  Guidelines  for  Carcinogen  Risk  Assessment,  at  5-1  to  5-7  (Mar.  2005),  available  at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2013-09/documents/cancer_guidelines_final_3-25-05.pdf. \n-9- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1100  ooff  3300\nEPA’s website also provides the following graphic showing EPA’s approach to risk management, \nwith a legend identifying which two of the five total components are included in the IRIS \nassessment (i.e., the IUR).   \n \nSource: https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-09/iris_rm.jpg \n \n28.  Similarly, EPA’s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment state that the risk \nassessment steps that include an IRIS assessment (i.e., hazard identification and dose-response \nassessment), along with the exposure assessment component, “serve as starting materials for the \noverall risk characterization process that completes the risk assessment.”  EPA, Guidelines for \nCarcinogen Risk Assessment, at 1-21 (emphasis added).  The Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk \nAssessment state that risk characterization “is an appraisal of the science that informs the risk \n-10- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1111  ooff  3300\nmanager in public health decisions, as do other decision-making analyses of economic, social, or \ntechnology issues.”  Id. at 5-1 to 5-2. \n29.  Consistent with the above, in rulemaking, EPA has recognized that:  \nIRIS is not a comprehensive toxicological database.  There may be more recent \nrelevant information available than is contained in IRIS. . . . IRIS values are not \nlegally binding and are not entitled to conclusive weight in any rulemaking.  In \naddition, EPA . . . should not rely exclusively on IRIS values but should consider \nall  credible  and  relevant  information  that  is  submitted  in  any  particular \nrulemaking.  If an outside party questions IRIS values during the course of an \nEPA rulemaking . . . EPA considers all credible and relevant information . . . . \n \nNational Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Minor Revisions to Public Notification \nRule and Consumer Confidence Report Rule, 66 Fed. Reg. 46928, 46929 (Sept. 7, 2001). \n30.  Consistent with that long-standing position, in the Benzene Rule, which now serves \nas the model for EPA’s analytical framework in Section 112 rulemakings, EPA set out a flexible \nprocess, requiring consideration of a range of factors, including scientific uncertainties and weight \nof evidence.  See Benzene Rule, 54 Fed. Reg. at 38,045.  EPA explained that the 1-in-10,000 risk \nlevel “does not necessarily reflect the true risk, but displays a conservative risk level which is an \nupper-bound that is unlikely to be exceeded.”  Id.  Here, the 0.2 μg/m3 value derived from the \nchloroprene IUR is similarly associated with an estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk level of \n1-in-10,000. \n31.  Until 2022, EPA’s approach to the 0.2 μg/m3 value derived from the chloroprene \nIUR was consistent with this approach: that is, EPA did not seek to impose the 0.2 μg/m3 value \nassociated with a 1-in-10,000 risk level as a bright-line and enforceable standard for chloroprene \nemissions.   \n32.  For example, in June 2016, six months after publishing the 2011 NATA, EPA \nissued an “Action Plan” to DPE and expressed its intent to “collect and evaluate site-specific \n-11- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1122  ooff  3300\ninformation” regarding chloroprene emissions.  See EPA, Action Plan: Denka Performance \nElastomer, LLC – Pontchartrain Facility (formerly the DuPont Neoprene Facility, Pontchartrain \nWorks)  LaPlace,  St.  John  the  Baptist  Parish,  Louisiana,  June  2016,  at  1,  available  at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-06/documents/epa-laplace-action-plan.pdf.  At that \ntime, EPA expressly recognized that the 2011 NATA, which relied in part on the chloroprene IUR, \nshould not be used “to identify actual exposures and associated risks to specific individuals.”  Id.  \nIn other words, EPA at that time took the position that there was no basis to apply 0.2 μg/m3 as a \nstandard for chloroprene emissions at the Facility.  \n33.  Similarly, in September 2019, the Director of EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning \nand Standards informed the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) by letter \nthat the 0.2 μg/m3 value for chloroprene exposure “is not based on an evaluation of current, real-\nworld exposures, is not an air quality standard, and it is not used directly for regulatory purposes.  \nFurthermore, the risks calculated using the [IUR], such as [1-in-10,000], is not a ‘bright line’ for \ndetermining whether a risk level is considered safe or acceptable.”  Letter from P. Tsirigotis (EPA) \nto  Dr.  C.  Brown  (LDEQ),  at  2  (Sept.  23,  2019),  available  at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/documents/image2019-09-23-132129.pdf.  In \nother words, as of September 2019, EPA confirmed that 0.2 μg/m3 was not a “bright line” standard \nfor determining risk, and certainly did not demand compliance with 0.2 μg/m3.  EPA further \nacknowledged that, “in setting emission standards under the Clean Air Act, risk is one factor that \nwe need to consider, along with information on costs, energy, safety, control technologies, and \nother relevant factors.  And there are many other factors.”  Id.   \n-12- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1133  ooff  3300\nD.  Starting  In  2022,  EPA  Abruptly—And  Without  Explanation—Reversed  Its  Position \nRegarding IURs. \n34.  On May 18, 2022, EPA suddenly reversed its policy of treating IURs as only one \nnon-determinative component in risk management.  Instead, EPA began treating the 0.2 μg/m3 \nvalue derived from the chloroprene IUR as a bright-line standard and ordered DPE to comply \nwith it, without providing any explanation or providing DPE an opportunity to comment or \nchallenge the new directive.  This reversal was manifested in multiple ways. \n35.  On May 18, 2022, in a meeting between representatives from EPA, the Department \nof Justice, and DPE, EPA announced that it considered the 0.2 μg/m3 standard derived from the \nchloroprene IUR to be confirmed and final and stated that EPA would not wait any longer for DPE \nto reduce chloroprene emissions below 0.2 μg/m3.  Mary Greene, the Director of EPA’s Air \nEnforcement Division, on behalf of EPA, directed DPE to take immediate action to implement \nspecific emission reduction projects to reduce chloroprene concentrations at the fence line of the \nFacility below 0.2 μg/m3.  EPA estimated that these projects would cost DPE $75 million.  Director \nGreene stated that if DPE did not implement these projects, then EPA would use “all available \ntools” to compel DPE to reduce chloroprene concentration levels below the 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  \nDirector Greene’s directive was made without regard to the multiple factors in addition to risk \nlevels addressed in EPA’s risk protocols, which demonstrated to DPE that, going forward, EPA \nwould treat the 0.2 μg/m3 standard as a bright line.  EPA provided DPE with no recourse to \nchallenge this abrupt change in DPE’s compliance obligations.   \n36.  Under  the  threat  of  EPA  employing  “all  available  tools”  against  DPE,  DPE \ncontinued to meet with EPA throughout the summer of 2022.  EPA continually demanded that \nDPE take actions, all designed to ensure DPE’s compliance with EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  DPE \nimplemented many of these actions, requiring it to incur costs it would not have otherwise incurred.  \n-13- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1144  ooff  3300\nIn August 2022, EPA continued its directives, and made express threats to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 \nstandard via emergency orders, including by specifying precise dates on which such orders would \nbe issued if DPE did not comply with EPA’s directives.  Importantly, Section 303 of the Clean Air \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 7603, and its parallel provision, Section 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. § 6973, permit \nEPA to issue administrative orders and immediate shutdown orders.  Thus, the “tools” that EPA \nthreatened to apply included its authority to file an emergency action that could force the Facility \nto shut down operations at any time.  With no administrative recourse, DPE continued to respond \nto EPA’s demands while diverting significant company resources to plan for the operational, \nreputational, and legal consequences of an administrative order that could shut down or effectively \nshut down DPE’s entire operations with no notice.   \n37.  Another  “tool”  available  to  EPA  is  its  authority  to  require  certain  minimum \nelements of operating permits that are issued by the states.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(d)(1).  EPA has \nsought, and upon information and belief is continuing to seek, to deploy this tool against DPE.  On \nOctober 12, 2022, EPA sent a “letter of concern” to LDEQ and the Louisiana Department of Health \n(“LDH”) regarding a complaint filed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (“October 2022 \nLetter”).  The October 2022 Letter emphasizes LDEQ’s responsibility under the Clean Air Act to \nissue  operating  permits  to  major  stationary  sources  like  the  Facility,  repeatedly  referenced \n0.2 μg/m3 as the benchmark that LDEQ should require DPE to achieve in order to protect the \ncommunity near the Facility, and urged LDEQ to take action on DPE’s pending operating permit \nrenewals.  Thus, the October 2022 Letter further illustrated EPA’s May 2022 pronouncement that \nEPA’s deliberations on the 0.2 μg/m3 standard derived from the chloroprene IUR were final and \nthat,  moving  forward,  EPA  would  apply  the  0.2  μg/m3 standard  as  a  bright  line,  with  no \nadjustments.  The October 2022 Letter also showed that EPA was (and, upon information and \n-14- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1155  ooff  3300\nbelief, still is) pressuring LDEQ to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 standard against the Facility via LDEQ’s \nissuance of operating permits.  Within days of a lawsuit by the State of Louisiana challenging \nEPA’s authority to pursue the investigation under the Civil Rights Act, EPA abruptly closed the \nunderlying investigation.  However, upon information and belief, EPA continues to seek to use \noperating permits as a “tool” to compel compliance with the 0.2 μg/m3 standard. \n38.  Also, beginning in August 2022, EPA escalated the use of its RCRA authority as a \n“tool” to compel reductions in chloroprene emissions below the 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  EPA’s RCRA \nteam demanded that DPE take measures to contain alleged hazardous waste at the Facility or face \nan emergency action under Section 7003 of RCRA.  This RCRA investigation resulted in a \nDecember 2022 partial Consent Agreement in which DPE agreed to comply with EPA’s demands \nwithout resolving DPE’s liability and expressly reserving EPA’s right to assess penalties for the \nalleged claims.   \n39.  Upon information and belief, EPA’s position with respect to DPE’s solid waste \nmanagement was predicated on the assumption that emissions associated with DPE’s solid waste \nwere contributing to chloroprene concentrations levels above 0.2 μg/m3 near the Facility and \nEPA’s view of 0.2 μg/m3 as a bright-line standard.  Internal EPA emails produced in response to a \nFOIA request indicate that, even before demanding that DPE comply with 0.2 μg/m3, EPA was \ndirecting its staff to institute a RCRA Section 7003 emergency action based on chloroprene \nreleases that were being detected by air monitors.  Notably, one internal EPA email states that, \nunder EPA’s interpretation of Section 7003 and based on EPA’s guidance for Section 7003 orders, \n“Denka is meeting all the check boxes for imminent and substantial endangerment, but so is just \nabout everybody else . . . .”  The same staff member suggested that actual concerns under RCRA \nwere not driving the potential emergency action, stating there “may be RCRA concerns about the \n-15- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1166  ooff  3300\noperation of the facility but for the time being my management wants [EPA to issue an order under \nSection] 7003.”  On December 28, 2022, EPA issued a press release announcing the Consent \nAgreement, which makes clear that EPA relied on its RCRA authority to reduce air emissions \nassociated with the Facility, stating that the waste at issue “contributes to emissions of chloroprene \nfrom the plant” and that the consent order would lead to “emissions reductions.”4   \n40.  EPA’s efforts to impose 0.2 μg/m3 as a bright-line standard continued in this lawsuit \nalleging an “imminent and substantial endangerment” (“ISE Action”), in which EPA seeks to use \nits emergency authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act as another “tool” to compel DPE \nto comply with the 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  The chloroprene concentration level at which EPA alleges \nthe emergency will be abated is the same level EPA demanded DPE meet during the May 18, 2022 \nmeeting: 0.2 μg/m3.  Relying entirely upon the 0.2 μg/m3 standard, EPA’s ISE Action seeks a \npermanent injunction requiring DPE to “immediately cease chloroprene and Neoprene production” \nuntil DPE “can demonstrate that it is able to maintain annual average chloroprene concentrations \n… at or below 0.2 μg/m3 in the areas surrounding the Facility.”  EPA’s “Statement of Final Relief” \n(Oct. 20, 2023).    \n41.  The ISE Action is action by EPA.

EPA agrees that it was the \nparty that “filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 7603 on February 28, 2023.”  Reply in Support of \nMot.  for  Prelim.  Injunction,  R.  Doc.  94,  at  10.    The  ISE  Action  authorized  by  the  EPA \nAdministrator alleges that the Facility’s emissions of chloroprene constitute an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment and seeks a permanent injunction requiring the Facility to shut down \nuntil it can demonstrate compliance with EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 standard for chloroprene.   \n42.  On March 20, 2023, the United States filed a motion for preliminary injunction \nseeking  a  shutdown  of  the  Facility  unless  DPE  complied  with  EPA’s  host  of  prescriptive \nrequirements.  In its briefing in support of the motion, the United States makes no effort to hide \nthat this unprecedented ISE Action is entirely dependent on enforcing EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 standard \nas a bright line.  See, e.g., Mem. in Support of Mot. for Preliminary Injunction, R. Doc. 9-2, at 6 \n(“For the relevant health effects of breathing chloroprene, the EPA determined that the average \nconcentration of chloroprene a person may regularly breathe over a 70-year lifetime without being \nexpected to exceed a 1-in-10,000 risk of contracting chloroprene-linked cancers is 0.2 μg/m3”); id. \nat 9 (“monitoring data shows that the communities surrounding Denka’s Facility are being exposed \nto long-term average airborne chloroprene levels that are between two and over fourteen times \ngreater than 0.2 μg/m3”); id. at 11 (“Even the lowest measured average value for Denka’s five \nclosest monitors (out of the six total) is about four times greater than 0.2 μg/m3.”); Reply in Support \nof Mot. For Preliminary Injunction, R. Doc. 94, at 25 (“Until Denka reduces long-term average \nchloroprene concentrations in the ambient air surrounding the Facility to approximately 0.2 μg/m3, \nthere remains a substantial likelihood of irreparable harm.”).  Indeed, the United States purports to \nsubstantiate its claim that current levels of chloroprene at the Facility “present unacceptably high \ncancer risk” using an expert—Dr. John Vandenberg—who specifically bases his opinion on the \n-17- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1188  ooff  3300\naccuracy  of  the  2010  Review.    Id.  at  21  (citing  Ex.  D,  Decl.  of  Dr.  John  Vandenberg).  \nDr. Vandenberg’s first opinion is that “EPA’s IRIS Assessment is scientifically accurate and \nconcludes  chloroprene  is  [a]  likely  and  potent  human  carcinogen.”  Id.  at  7  (opinion  I).  \nDr. Vandenberg also provides a straight-forward calculation that uses the chloroprene IUR as an \nestablished quantity.  Id. at 24 (“Cancer risks for inhaled pollutants are calculated by multiplying \nthe ADAF-adjusted IUR [provided in the 2010 Review] by the concentration of chloroprene in the \nair that people are exposed to for the duration of exposure and summed across age groups to \nestimate lifetime cancer risk to a specified amount of a substance.”).   \n43.  In response to discovery in the ISE Action, EPA confirmed that it considers the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard to be final and that the ISE Action is predicated entirely on enforcing 0.2 μg/m3 \nas a bright-line standard.  EPA’s response to DPE’s Interrogatory No. 4 states: “EPA believes that \nthe ambient air concentration of chloroprene that Denka needs to achieve in order to abate the \nimminent and substantial endangerment alleged in the PI Motion is 0.2 μg/m3.”  EPA’s Statement \nof Final Relief for the permanent injunction puts its position in the starkest of terms: DPE must \nshut down its Facility immediately and not return to production until 0.2 μg/m3 can be achieved.  \nEPA’s “Statement of Final Relief” (Oct. 20, 2023).  Thus, EPA reconfirmed the directive that EPA \nannounced to DPE on May 18, 2022—i.e., that EPA had determined that 0.2 μg/m3 is a post-\ndeliberative, final standard which EPA seeks to enforce using “all available tools.”  \nE.  EPA Has Improperly Established The 0.2 μg/m3 Standard As A Workaround To Proper \nAnd Lawful Rulemaking. \n44.  In April 2023, EPA released a proposed rule that would amend the regulations \ngoverning emissions of chloroprene.  Notably, the preamble to the proposed rule recites EPA’s \npolicy that IURs and similar IRIS values are only used in the first step required in promulgating \nemissions standards.  See Proposed Rule, New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic \n-18- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  1199  ooff  3300\nOrganic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers \nand Resins Industry, 88 Fed. Reg. 25080, 38044-45 (Apr. 25, 2023) (“Proposed Rule”) (citing \nBenzene Rule).  DPE has provided comments to EPA addressing the scientific flaws in the \nProposed Rule as well as EPA’s misapplication of its risk protocols.  See DPE July 7, 2023 \nComments to EPA Proposed Rule (Ex. 1 to DPE Opp. to Mot. for Preliminary Injunction), R. Doc. \n73-1.  If EPA does not correct these errors in the final rule, DPE intends to challenge the final rule \nin court.  However, because EPA has already begun implementing “all available tools” to enforce \nthe 0.2 μg/m3 standard, DPE seeks review of the establishment and imposition of that standard.  \n45.  EPA effectively admits in briefing in this case that the ISE Action is yet another \nworkaround to allow it to impose the 0.2 μg/m3 standard on DPE before EPA completes the \nrulemaking through the process required by Congress in the Clean Air Act and the APA, and in \ncase its use of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard in the rulemaking does not pass judicial scrutiny.  Reply in \nSupport of Mot. for Preliminary Injunction, R. Doc. 94, at 29 (“The Proposed Rule’s current \ncompliance deadline is not until March 2026 – two years after the yet-to-be finalized rule’s \neffective date . . . . And Denka is sharpening its knives to entirely dismantle the Proposed Rule . . \n. . There is an important ongoing need for the requested preliminary injunction.”).  EPA doubtless \nalso seeks to avoid the judicial review provisions of the Clean Air Act by establishing what is \neffectively the same standard in a clandestine and non-transparent manner, without the trouble of \ncomplying with the Clean Air Act’s and APA’s process requirements.  The APA does not allow \nthis ultra vires agency action.  DPE is entitled to judicial review of EPA’s establishment of the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard and EPA’s use of “all available tools” in imposing that standard. \n-19- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2200  ooff  3300\nFURTHER ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTING COUNTERCLAIM \nA.  EPA Has Disregarded Substantial Scientific Evidence That The 0.2 μg/m3 Standard Is Not \nNecessary To Protect Human Health Or The Environment. \n46.  EPA’s sudden reversal of its policy regarding the use of IURs and enforcement of \n0.2 μg/m3 as an ambient air standard is especially troubling in light of the substantial scientific \nevidence available when EPA first developed the chloroprene IUR and the even more robust \nevidence available in 2022, when EPA began enforcing 0.2 μg/m3 as an effective ambient air \nstandard.  That scientific evidence showed that 0.2 μg/m3 is not necessary to protect human health \nor the environment.  DPE was provided no meaningful opportunity to correct EPA’s flawed \nscience before or after EPA’s May 18, 2022 directive.  \n47.  In setting the stringent 0.2 μg/m3 standard for chloroprene, EPA relied upon a \ndefault assumption that humans are as sensitive to chloroprene as the female B6C3F1 mouse.  See \nEPA’s Response to DPE’s RFA No. 17 (“The United States further admits that the inhalation unit \nrisk for chloroprene determined in the 2010 IRIS assessment is based on the assumption that \nhumans are as sensitive to chloroprene exposure as the female B6C3F1 mouse.”).  While EPA \nrelied entirely on female B6C3F1 mice studies, it disregarded study results of all other animal \nspecies, including male B6C3F1 mice, all of which found a dramatically lower (even zero) cancer \nrisk.  Declaration of P. Robinan Gentry (“Gentry Decl.”), R. Doc. 73-5, ¶ 37, Table 1.  This was a \nfundamental error due to the substantial toxicokinetic differences between female B6C3F1 mice \nand humans, resulting in EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 value dramatically overstating human cancer risks \nassociated with exposure to chloroprene.  Id.  Peer reviewers in the 2010 Review recognized this \nfundamental shortcoming and raised concerns regarding the toxicokinetic differences between \nhumans and female B6C3F1 mice.  Id. ¶ 39-40.  \n-20- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2211  ooff  3300\n48.  EPA compounded this incorrect conservative assumption with a series of other \nconservative assumptions.  Three steps were used to translate the B6C3F1 mouse data into EPA’s \nchloroprene IUR: (i) developing an “upper bound” composite risk estimate for all tumor sites \nobserved in the study of 2.7 x 10-4 per μg/m3; (ii) rounding the estimate upward to one significant \ndigit, to 3 x 10-4 per μg/m3; and (iii) applying the age adjustment factors to increase the IUR by \n67% to 5 x 10-4 per μg/m3.  See 2010 Review at 137-38.  \n49.  The 2010 peer review comments supported EPA’s preference to develop a PBPK \nmodel, a specialized computer model specifically designed to adjust risk assessments due to the \ndifferent toxicological effects of a chemical from one species to another—for example, the \ndifferences  between  female  B6C3F1  mice  and  humans.    Declaration  of  Michael  Lumpkin \n(“Lumpkin Decl.”), R. Doc. 73-4, ¶¶ 41-50. \n50.  EPA expressly acknowledged that it would be appropriate for EPA to rely upon a \nnew and improved PBPK model for chloroprene and encouraged DPE to develop such a model.  \nBetween 2017 and 2021, DPE and EPA actively coordinated to develop a new and improved PBPK \nmodel for chloroprene.  Gentry Decl., R. Doc. 73-5, ¶¶ 17-33.  DPE employed a team of scientists \nat Ramboll US Consulting, Inc. (“Ramboll”) to develop and refine this PBPK model.  Id.  Ramboll \nprepared a work plan for the development of a PBPK model and, in April 2018, provided the draft \nwork plan to EPA for its review and comment.  Id.  On information and belief, EPA committed \nsubstantial resources to provide Ramboll with quality assurance guidance on the development of \nthe PBPK model.  In June 2019, to ensure that the new PBPK model was correct, Ramboll \nsubmitted the PBPK model for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Inhalation Toxicology, \n-21- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2222  ooff  3300\nand after peer review, the PBPK model was published in January 2020.5  In October 2020, EPA \nitself sponsored an external peer review of an updated version of the Ramboll PBPK model.  The \n2020 peer review panel provided comments.  By early 2021, Ramboll had substantively revised \nthe PBPK model to address all the meaningful comments from the EPA-sponsored peer review, \nmaking technical changes in the model to provide a better fit for cross-species tumor predictions \namong laboratory test animals.  Gentry Decl., R. Doc. 73-5, ¶ 60.  \n51.  However, unbeknownst to DPE, EPA sponsored another independent peer review \nof the new Ramboll PBPK model for chloroprene in 2021.  Unlike the 2020 EPA-sponsored \nexternal peer review, this follow-up peer review was conducted secretly and without giving \nRamboll the opportunity to address any questions from the peer review panel.  Nonetheless, the \nfollow-up  peer  review  demonstrated  that  Ramboll  had  successfully  addressed  most  of  the \ncomments on prior versions of the PBPK model.  On balance, the peer reviewers considered the \nRamboll PBPK model to be ready for use in estimating an IUR for an IRIS review.  Following the \n2021 peer review sponsored by EPA, Ramboll revised the PBPK model, and the model, again, \nunderwent journal peer review and was published a fourth time in August 2023.6  Ramboll \naddressed and resolved all critical comments and questions raised by EPA-sponsored peer reviews \nand there are no issues that reasonably counter using the PBPK model to calculate an IUR.

In 2021, EPA personnel abruptly ceased all substantive communications with DPE \nregarding the Ramboll PBPK model or any appropriate revisions to the IUR based on that model.  \n53.  The  2010  peer  review  also  strongly  criticized  EPA’s  misuse  of  the  relevant \nepidemiological data in the 2010 Review.  The most important and comprehensive epidemiological \nstudies of chloroprene that were available in 2010 were studies of U.S. chloroprene workers \nprepared in 2007 by Dr. Gary Marsh, Ph.D.7  Dr. Marsh’s 2007 studies involved, among other \nthings, an analysis of chloroprene exposure at the Facility and showed no relationship between \nworker exposure to chloroprene and lung or liver cancer mortalities.8   \n54.  DPE provided EPA with a major new follow-up epidemiological study conducted \nby Dr. Marsh in 2021.  Dr. Marsh’s new study provided an update through 2017 regarding the \ncohort of U.S. chloroprene workers that was the subject of Dr. Marsh’s 2007 study.  The updated \n2021 Marsh study showed no increase in cancer mortalities among U.S. chloroprene workers. \n55.  Further, DPE provided EPA with data from the Louisiana Tumor Registry, which \nindicated lower cancer incidence rates in St. John the Baptist Parish compared to the state average.  \nData from the Louisiana Tumor Registry continues to show no increase in cancer incidence rates \nin the community surrounding DPE’s Facility.  Like Dr. Marsh’s updated epidemiological data, \n \n7 See Gary M. Marsh, et al., Mortality Patterns Among Industrial Workers Exposed to Chloroprene \nand Other Substances. II. Mortality in Relation to Exposure, Chem. Biol. Interact. 166(1-3):301-\n16 (Mar. 20, 2007), https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17007827/.  \n8  As discussed further below, Dr. Marsh performed a major follow-up epidemiological study in \n2021, which provided an update through 2017 regarding the cohort of chloroprene workers that \nwas the subject of Dr. Marsh’s 2007 study.  The updated 2021 Marsh study showed no increase in \ncancer mortalities among U.S. chloroprene workers.  See Garry M. Marsh, et al., Mortality \nPatterns Among Industrial Workers Exposed to Chloroprene and Other Substances: Extended \nFollow-Up,  J.  Occup.  Environ.  Med.  63(2):126-138  (Feb.  1,  2021), \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33234876/. \n-23- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2244  ooff  3300\nthe Louisiana Tumor Registry data strongly support the conclusion that chloroprene does not pose \na meaningful risk to humans.   \n56.  DPE submitted this scientific data to EPA in formal petitions for correction and \nreconsideration of the 2020 Review, including (i) a June 26, 2017 Request for Correction; (ii) a \nJuly 23, 2018 Request for Reconsideration of the denial of the 2017 Request for Correction (which \nDPE withdrew after working with EPA to develop the PBPK model); (iii) a July 15, 2021 Request \nfor Correction; and (iv) a June 10, 2022, DPE Request for Reconsideration of the denial of the \n2021  Request  for  Correction.    EPA  denied  DPE’s  2022  Request  for  Reconsideration  on \nOctober 19, 2022, thereby affirming EPA’s denial of the 2021 Request for Correction.  Notably, \nwhen EPA denied the 2021 Request for Correction and the 2022 Request for Reconsideration, it \ndid not base its decisions on concerns about the quality or relevance of the scientific information \npresented by DPE.  Rather, the agency simply said that it was not required to update the 2010 IRIS \nAssessment and that it did not have enough resources to do so.  Thus, EPA denied these requests \nwithout even considering the new scientific studies submitted by DPE.  \nB.  EPA’s Establishment And Enforcement Of The 0.2 μg/m3 Standard Is Reviewable By This \nCourt. \n57.  EPA did not meaningfully consider the substantial scientific evidence that the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard derived from the chloroprene IUR does not accurately reflect the risk of cancer \nassociated with chloroprene emissions or undertake a comprehensive risk characterization and risk \nmanagement process based on EPA’s established policies and procedures.  Instead, in 2022, EPA \nundertook agency action that doubled down on these errors by establishing the 0.2 μg/m3 as a \nregulatory standard, equivalent to a rule, and directly applying that standard against DPE under \nthe threat of using “all available tools” to force full compliance.   \n-24- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2255  ooff  3300\n58.  On May 18, 2022, EPA communicated its position that the science behind the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard was settled and that the 0.2 μg/m3 standard was applicable and enforceable.  \nSince May 18, 2022, EPA has relentlessly reinforced this position, and threatened DPE with \nemergency actions if it did not reduce emissions enough to ensure that off-site concentrations of \nchloroprene are below 0.2 μg/m3.  Director Greene’s directive on May 18, 2022, was followed by \nEPA actions designed to coerce DPE’s adherence to the 0.2 μg/m3 standard more quickly—(i) the \nOctober 2022 Letter seeking to have LDEQ enforce 0.2 μg/m3 via emissions permits, (ii) the use \nof EPA’s RCRA authority to reduce ambient air concentrations, and, most recently, (iii) the ISE \nAction seeking to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  These overlapping coercive actions demonstrate \nthat EPA was not bluffing when it directed DPE to comply with 0.2 μg/m3 as a standard and that \nEPA will not stop enforcing the 0.2 μg/m3 standard until it is achieved.   \n59.  The establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard satisfies both conditions for finality.  \n“First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process—it must \nnot be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.  And second, the action must be one by which \nrights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (cleaned up). \n60.  The establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard is final and not subject to further \ndecision-making by EPA.  EPA has rejected DPE’s administrative challenges to the chloroprene \nIUR and rejected or ignored calls to revisit the 0.2 μg/m3 standard.  As a policy matter, after \ndenying DPE’s 2021 Request for Correction, EPA could have revisited the 0.2 μg/m3 standard in \nresponse to these requests.  Instead, EPA convened the May 18, 2022 meeting to announce to DPE \nthat the possibility of revisiting the 0.2 μg/m3 standard was foreclosed, that EPA had finalized its \nposition, and that EPA would seek to enforce the standard using “all available tools.”  EPA made \n-25- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2266  ooff  3300\nclear that the position it was communicating was not “merely tentative.”  Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997).  \n61.  As to the second Bennett prong, the establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard has led \nto legal consequences and determined rights and obligations because (i) it binds EPA and its staff, \nTexas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. 2019), and (ii) has led to substantial negative \nconsequences for DPE.  It is clear from Director Greene’s directive at the May 18, 2022 meeting, \nfrom the face of the October 2022 Letter, and from the complaint, motion for preliminary \ninjunction, and Statement of Final Relief in the ISE Action that EPA has applied—and will \ncontinue to apply—the 0.2 μg/m3 standard as a bright line, with no adjustments.  Indeed, the very \npurpose of the May 18, 2022 meeting was to disabuse DPE of any notion that EPA would revisit \nthe 0.2 μg/m3 standard and to direct DPE to meet that standard or face the full force of EPA’s \nenforcement tools. \n62.  After the May 18, 2022 meeting, DPE faced a choice—and still does—to either \ncomply with EPA’s order to comply with the 0.2 μg/m3 standard or face a battery of EPA actions, \nincluding emergency actions under the Clean Air Act and RCRA.  These provisions permit EPA \nto issue immediate shutdown orders, before the opportunity for judicial review.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7603 (no judicial review for 60 days); id. § 6973 (no judicial review requirement).  EPA retains \nits ability to bring a RCRA Section 7003 action predicated on 0.2 μg/m3 at any time.  “The APA’s \nfinal agency action requirement prevents this strong-arming of regulated parties into ‘voluntary \ncompliance’ without the opportunity for judicial review . . . .”  San Francisco Herring Ass’n v. \nDep’t of the Interior, 946 F.3d 564, 582 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, \n131 (2012)).  \n-26- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2277  ooff  3300\n63.  EPA’s  establishment  of  the  0.2  μg/m3  standard  has  had  severely  negative \nconsequences  for  DPE  beyond  defending  the  ISE  Action  (though  those  costs  have  been \nsubstantial).  DPE has poured extensive resources into investigating and implementing emissions \nreduction projects demanded by EPA.  Because of EPA’s establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard, \nDPE is effectively precluded from expanding chloroprene and neoprene production and from \nimplementing other business decisions that would lead to increased chloroprene emissions.  DPE \nemployees have spent thousands of hours innovating ways to further reduce chloroprene emissions \nand engaged multiple third-party consultants for the same purpose, all at great cost to DPE.   \n64.  Based on the October 2022 Letter, and upon information and belief, EPA will \nrequire LDEQ to issue operating permits that seek to limit chloroprene concentrations near DPE’s \nFacility to 0.2 μg/m3, even after having withdrawn the civil rights investigation underlying the \nOctober 2022 Letter. \n65.  Further, the emission reduction measures demanded by EPA during the May 18, \n2022 meeting and demanded by EPA in the ISE Action—with the express purpose of meeting the \n0.2 μg/m3 standard—would require DPE to invest substantial time and capital in further emissions \nreductions projects.  In addition, the Statement of Final Relief sought by EPA in the ISE Action \nwould require DPE to immediately shut down the Facility, depriving DPE of its only source of \nrevenue, forcing employees and contractors out of work, harming DPE’s reputation, and impairing \nits ability to meet contractual obligations.  \n66.  As alleged above, the establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard constitutes “final” \nagency action under Bennett.  However, regardless of whether these allegations establish “final” \nagency action under Bennett, this Court may review the Agency’s imposition of an ultra vires \n-27- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2288  ooff  3300\nstandard limiting DPE’s air emissions.  See Apter v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 80 F.4th \n579, 591 (5th Cir. 2023).  \nAMENDED COUNTERCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Counterclaim-Defendants’ Establishment of a Chloroprene Standard Using an \nUnadjusted IUR in Bright-Line Fashion Is Arbitrary, Capricious, an Abuse of Discretion, \nand Contrary to Law) \n67.  DPE incorporates paragraphs 1 – 66 as if fully set forth herein. \n68.  EPA’s establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard through its actions beginning in \n2022—i.e., the senior EPA official’s May 2022 threat, the October 2022 Letter seeking to have \nLDEQ enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 standard via emissions permits, the use of EPA’s RCRA authority \npredicated on the 0.2 μg/m3 standard, and the ISE Action seeking to enforce the 0.2 μg/m3 \nstandard—is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law.  The 0.2 μg/m3 \nstandard is a substantive rule that should have been subject to the notice and comment requirements \nof the APA and the Clean Air Act.  5 U.S.C. § 552–553; 42 U.S.C. §§ 7412, 7607.  EPA has not \ncompleted its rulemaking process and does not have the authority to promulgate ambient air \nstandards outside of this process.   \n69.  Further,  EPA’s  abrupt  and  unexplained  about-face  in  policy  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious, in violation of the APA.  EPA has arbitrarily and capriciously reversed 30 years of \nEPA risk assessment policy without reasoned explanation by treating a value based on the \nchloroprene IUR in a strict, “bright line” fashion.  “Where an agency changes its policy, the agency \nmust show awareness that it is changing a policy and give a reasoned explanation for the adoption \nof the new policy.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009).  Here, EPA for \nthe first time adopted a risk value based on a maximum plausible IUR value to impose that value \nas a standard, without considering the other factors required by Section 112(f)(2)(A) of the Clean \nAir Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(2)(A), including “costs, energy, and other relevant factors.”  EPA \n-28- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  2299  ooff  3300\nhas failed to undertake the two-step analysis described in the Benzene Rule and endorsed by \nCongress in Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.  Instead, EPA has simply determined, based on its \nview of the “maximum plausible risk,” that a 1-in-10,000 lifetime cancer risk from chloroprene is \nunacceptable without any consideration of the other factors.  This departure from policy is \nparticularly  egregious  in  light  of  EPA’s  refusal  to  consider  substantial,  relevant  scientific \ninformation, including the Ramboll PBPK Model, the Marsh epidemiology studies, and the \nLouisiana Tumor Registry data. \n70.  EPA was obligated to conduct a formal rulemaking that provides a “reasoned \nexplanation” for its change in policy with respect to IUR values.  EPA’s failure to do so, resulting \nin the 0.2 μg/m3 standard, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance \nwith law, in violation of the APA.   \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nFor the reasons set forth above, DPE respectfully requests that the Court grant the following \nrelief: \n71.  A judicial declaration that EPA’s establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard for \nchloroprene was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, \nbecause EPA contradicted decades of EPA practice and policy by relying on an unadjusted IUR \nvalue in creating an ambient air standard without consideration of other relevant factors, through \nnotice and comment, while failing to provide a reasoned explanation for this departure, in violation \nof the APA. \n72.  A judicial declaration that EPA’s establishment of the 0.2 μg/m3 standard for \nchloroprene, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, \nbecause EPA failed to consider substantial scientific evidence showing that this standard is \nunnecessary to protect human health or the environment. \n-29- \n\nCCaassee  22::2233--ccvv--0000773355--CCJJBB--MMBBNN      DDooccuummeenntt  110048      FFiilleedd  1101//2053//2233      PPaaggee  3300  ooff  3300\n73.  An order enjoining EPA from enforcing the 0.2 μg/m3 standard for chloroprene \nuntil EPA complies with the notice and comment provisions of the APA and the Clean Air Act \nand EPA provides a reasoned explanation for its departure from decades of EPA practice and \npolicy regarding risk assessment. \n74.  An order permanently enjoining EPA from applying the 0.2 μg/m3 standard for \nchloroprene unless and until EPA has fully considered the scientific evidence regarding the \npotential risk of chloroprene to humans.   \n75.  An order granting all such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.  \n \n \nDated:  October 25, 2023  Respectfully submitted, \n \n   \nJONES WALKER LLP    /s/ David A.

LEGAL STANDARD ..................................................................................................4 \nIII.  ARGUMENT ...............................................................................................................5 \nA.  In Issuing The Proposed Rule, EPA Conceded That The Facility’s \nEmissions Are Not Causing An “Imminent Endangerment.” ..........................5 \nB.  The Risk Levels Alleged By EPA In This Lawsuit Do Not Constitute \nAn Imminent And Substantial Endangerment As A Matter Of Law. ..............8 \n1.  In Section 112, Congress made clear that the risk levels alleged \nby EPA here do not constitute an imminent and substantial \nendangerment  by  mandating  that  such  risks  be  addressed \nthrough an 18-year regulatory process. ................................................9 \n2.  The Benzene Rule addressed risk levels up to 60-times higher \nthan the 1-in-10,000 risk level EPA relies on here, yet EPA did \nnot allege the facilities responsible for such risks were causing \nan imminent and substantial endangerment. .......................................13 \n3.  EPA’s long-standing acceptance of risk levels greater than 1-\nin-10,000 shows that such level of risk is not a permissible \nthreshold  for  alleging  an  imminent  and  substantial \nendangerment. .....................................................................................15 \n4.  EPA’s decision not to take “emergency” action against the \nFacility  for  seven  years  simply  underscores  EPA’s  long-\nstanding  position  that  a  1-in-10,000  risk  level  does  not \nconstitute an imminent and substantial endangerment. ......................19 \nC.  EPA’s Chloroprene IUR Cannot Be Used As A Threshold For Alleging \nImminent  And  Substantial  Endangerment  Because  EPA  Expressly \nAdmits That The IUR Is Based On A Default Assumption That EPA \nHas No Evidence To Substantiate. .................................................................22 \nIV.

INTRODUCTION \nAccording to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, the average American has a 1-in-3 risk \nof getting cancer in their lifetime.1  In this case, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) \nclaims that Denka Performance Elastomer LLC’s (“DPE”) manufacturing facility (“Facility”) is \ncausing an “imminent and substantial endangerment” because its chloroprene emissions pose a \ncancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a hypothetical person who breathes in those emissions near the \nFacility all day, every day for 70 years.  Even if this counterfactual assumption were true, that \nhypothetical person’s lifetime risk of cancer due to proximity to the Facility would be increased \nfrom 1-in-3 (or 3,333-in-10,000) to 3,338-in-10,000.   \nEPA argues that the Facility is causing an imminent and substantial endangerment because \nits emissions result in off-site, ambient air concentrations of chloroprene greater than 0.2 μg/m3—\na level that EPA alleges is needed to ensure that the lifetime cancer risk due to chloroprene \nexposure continuously all day, every day for 70 years is no higher than 1-in-10,000.  Thus, EPA’s \ncase is about  reducing  lifetime chloroprene cancer risk  from 5-in-10,000 to 1-in-10,000 (a \nreduction in risk of 4-in-10,000).  This means that a hypothetical (but completely implausible) \nperson’s lifetime cancer risk would be reduced from 3,338-in-10,000 to 3,334-in-10,000.  So dire \nis  this  endangerment,  according  to  EPA,  that  this  Court  must  shut  down  DPE’s  Facility \nimmediately.  Never before has EPA made a claim like this one—and for good reason.  Even under \nthe facts alleged by EPA, there is no imminent and substantial endangerment as a matter of law. \nEPA’s  “emergency”  action  here  runs  directly  counter  to  the  statutory  program  that \nCongress created under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) to address this exact situation—\n \n1  See  https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/cancer.htm  (last \nchecked on Dec. 19, 2023). \n-1- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 8 of 32\nalleged cancer risks caused by emissions from an industrial facility.  42 U.S.C. § 7412.  EPA has \nalready issued a proposed rule for chloroprene under Section 112 that addresses the very same \nemissions from the very same Facility but, critically, gives DPE two to three years to comply while \nthe Facility remains operational (instead of an immediate shutdown as EPA demands here).  \n88 Fed. Reg. 25,080 (April 25, 2023) (“Proposed Rule”) (Ex. 1).  Given that the final rule for \nchloroprene is due on March 29, 2024, the Court may question why it should bother holding a two-\nweek trial only days before the final rule is issued.  There is no good answer to that question.  \nUnder Section 112, Congress required EPA to adopt rules to address the exact risks at issue \nhere.  But under the timelines adopted by Congress, risk reviews were not required until 18 years \nafter the statute was adopted.  Surely, if Congress believed that a cancer risk above 1-in-10,000 \nwas an imminent and substantial endangerment, it would not have given EPA 18 years to address \nit.  Until this lawsuit, EPA had never suggested that a 1-in-10,000 risk level constitutes an \nimminent and substantial endangerment.  To the contrary, EPA has tolerated far greater risk levels \nthroughout its history of implementing Section 112, including a 60-in-10,000 risk in a 1989 \nrulemaking  that  EPA  views  as  the  “primary  model”  for  Section  112  rulemaking  and  was \nspecifically endorsed by Congress.  Most recently, in the Proposed Rule, EPA was statutorily \nrequired  to  consider  whether  current  chloroprene  emissions  from  the  Facility  constitute  an \n“imminent endangerment,” and EPA determined that they do not.2  Because those same emissions \ncannot  constitute  an  “imminent  and  substantial  endangerment”  under  Section 303,  this \nfundamental concession alone requires dismissal of this action.   \n \n2 As with all EPA rules, the Proposed Rule was signed by the head of EPA after sign-off from all \nrelevant parts of EPA.  In contrast, there is no such process for a Section 303 action such as this \none, which requires sign-off only from lower-level officials in the enforcement office.

EPA’s own figure (copied below) shows the steep decline in the Facility’s emissions, including \nduring the seven years in which EPA possessed data it now relies upon to allege an emergency.  \n \nSee 10/12/2022 Letter from EPA to LDEQ at 28 (Ex. 3).  It defies credulity that there is suddenly \nan emergency now given EPA’s years of inaction when emissions were far higher.     \nFinally, summary judgment should be granted because EPA admits it has no evidence to \nsubstantiate the 1-in-10,000 risk level, a figure that relies entirely upon a default, worst-case \nscenario assumption.  That unsubstantiated assumption is insufficient to prove that the Facility’s \nemissions pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health.  \n-3- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 10 of 32\nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nIn this action, EPA must prove that “a pollution source … is presenting an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment to public health or welfare, or the environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 7603. \nSummary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure \nmaterials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthat the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, \n322 (1986).  In assessing if any material fact issues exist, a court considers “all of the evidence in \nthe record but refrains from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.”  Delta \n& Pine Land Co. v. Nationwide Agribusiness Ins. Co., 530 F.3d 395, 398 (5th Cir. 2008).  A party \ncannot defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated assertions.  Little \nv. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994).  If the dispositive issue is one on which \nthe nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, the moving party may satisfy its burden \nby merely pointing out that the evidence in the record is insufficient with respect to an essential \nelement of the nonmoving party’s claim.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325.  The burden then shifts to \nthe nonmoving party, who must, by submitting or referring to evidence, set out specific facts \nshowing that a genuine issue exists.  See id. at 324.  The nonmovant may not rest upon the \npleadings but must identify specific facts that establish a genuine issue for trial.  See id. at 325.  \nHere, summary judgment may be granted if EPA has failed to present sufficient evidence \nfor the Court “to find that the alleged [pollution] presents a reasonable prospect of future harm and \nhence that it may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.”  \nSimsbury-Avon Preservation Club, Inc. v. Metacon Gun Club, Inc., 575 F.3d 199, 211-12 (2d Cir. \n2009) (applying RCRA).  \n-4- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 11 of 32\nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  In Issuing The Proposed Rule, EPA Conceded That The Facility’s Emissions Are Not \nCausing An “Imminent Endangerment.” \nEPA’s claim that the Facility’s chloroprene emissions are causing an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment is directly refuted by the Proposed Rule that EPA published after it \ninitiated this litigation.  88 Fed. Reg. 25,080 (Ex. 1).  As discussed below, in issuing the Proposed \nRule, EPA was required by statute to assess whether the Facility’s current chloroprene emissions \nconstitute an “imminent endangerment,” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(4), and EPA necessarily determined \nthey do not.  Having already determined that the Facility’s chloroprene emissions are not causing \nan “imminent endangerment,” EPA cannot legitimately assert that those same emissions constitute \nan even more dire “imminent and substantial endangerment” under Section 303.3   \nUnder Section 112(f) of the CAA, when EPA issues new pollution control requirements to \naddress unacceptable cancer risks, there is a statutory presumption that a source must comply with \nthose requirements within 90 days.  42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(4).  However, this default 90-day period \nmay be extended up to two years if EPA grants a compliance “waiver.”  Id.  A waiver of the 90-\nday compliance deadline may be extended only if EPA “finds that [additional time] is necessary \nfor the installation of controls and that steps will be taken during the period of the waiver to assure \nthat the health of persons will be protected from imminent endangerment.”  Id.  (emphasis added).   \n \n3 EPA’s concession that there is no imminent endangerment is an evidentiary admission.  See In \nre McLain, 516 F.3d 301, 309 (5th Cir. 2008) (evidentiary admissions include a “concession made \nfor some independent purpose” and “[s]uch admissions ‘are received as substantive evidence of \nthe facts admitted’”) (quoting Martinez v. Bally’s Louisiana, Inc., 244 F.3d 474, 476–77 (5th Cir. \n2001)); 2 McCormick On Evid. § 254 (8th ed.) (recognizing “admissions by conduct”). EPA’s \nadmission requires dismissal of this action because proving an imminent endangerment is a core \nelement of EPA’s case. \n-5- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 12 of 32\nIn  the  Proposed  Rule,  EPA  gave  DPE  the  full  2-year  period  to  comply  with  the \nSection 112(f) requirements.  88 Fed. Reg. at 25,178 (Ex. 1).  EPA said the 2-year period is \nappropriate because the “proposed provisions will require additional time to plan, purchase, and \ninstall equipment for … chloroprene control.”  Id.  Section 112(f)(4) precludes EPA from granting \nthe 2-year waiver unless it finds that (i) there is no “imminent endangerment” or (ii) steps will be \ntaken to protect against such an endangerment.  Thus, under the statute’s plain language, EPA \ncould not have granted the waiver in the Proposed Rule unless it found there is no imminent \nendangerment, because EPA did not include any steps to protect against any purported imminent \nendangerment.4   \nIndeed, EPA’s grant of the 2-year waiver in the Proposed Rule is consistent with EPA’s \nlong-standing view that lifetime cancer risks above 1-in-10,000 do not constitute “imminent \nendangerment”  and  the  fact  that,  for  30  years,  EPA  has  routinely  granted  Section  112(f) \ncompliance waivers even when cancer risks are well above this level.  In fact, EPA has admitted \nthat  it  has  never  found  a  pre-compliance  risk  level  in  a  rulemaking  to  be  an  “imminent \nendangerment,” including rulemakings where the pre-compliance risk level was greater than 1-in-\n10,000.  See EPA’s Response to Interrogatory No. 17 at 17 (Ex. 4).  For example, in the proposed \nrule for Sterilization Facilities, EPA proposed an 18-month waiver where the maximum risk was \n60-in-10,000 and 18,000 people faced higher than the 1-in-10,000 risk level.  See 88 Fed. Reg. \n22,790, 22,794 (4/13/23) (risk estimates) (Ex. 5); id. at 22,852-53 (waiver).  In addition, EPA’s \n \n4  EPA has tried to avoid this critical concession in the Proposed Rule by arguing that the preamble \nto the Proposed Rule is silent on whether there is no “imminent endangerment.”  R. Doc. 94 at 11.  \nBut that argument ignores the statutory language, which mandates that the 2-year waiver (which \nEPA granted) cannot be granted unless there is no imminent endangerment or EPA identifies steps \nto avoid such endangerment.  Thus, the waiver could not have been granted unless EPA found no \nimminent endangerment.  Under the statute’s plain language, EPA cannot avoid the implications \nof its granting the 2-year waiver by relying on the absence of “magic words” in the preamble. \n-6- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 13 of 32\nProposed Rule proposes the same 2-year waiver for ethylene oxide sources despite those sources \nhaving risk estimates higher than chloroprene.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,116 (15-in-10,000 risk \nestimate solely for ethylene oxide pressure relief devices) (Ex. 1); id. at 25,178 (waiver).   \nBefore  publication,  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (“OMB”)  reviewed  the \nProposed  Rule  and  questioned  if  the  Facility’s  emissions  would  constitute  an  “imminent \nendangerment.”  OMB Review at 347 (Ex. 6).  OMB asked that EPA address “what steps will be \ntaken  during  the  proposed  2-year  period  to  assure  that  the  health  of  people  exposed  to \n[chloroprene]  emissions  (including  children)  will  receive  protection  from  imminent \nendangerment[.]”  Id.  EPA declined to change the 2-year waiver and made no changes to describe \nsteps to protect from “imminent endangerment.”  Instead, EPA responded that “[s]ignificant \ncapital will need to be invested in controls here to further reduce emissions [of ethylene oxide] and \nchloroprene. . . . This takes significant time [to] engineer, install, and update operating procedures \nand staff.”  Id.  Under the plain language of Section 112(f), by declining to impose any protective \nsteps during the compliance period, EPA conceded there is no imminent endangerment.   \nEPA’s grant of a waiver in the Proposed Rule confirms that a 1-in-10,000 risk estimate was \nnever designed as a measure of whether emissions cause an “imminent endangerment.”  That is \nwhy EPA routinely—indeed, always (see EPA’s Response to Interrogatory No. 17 at 17 (Ex. 4))—\ngrants waivers under Section 112(f), like it has done here, because it recognizes that upper-bound \nlifetime cancer risks are not proof of “imminent endangerment.”  Indeed, EPA made this point \nemphatically in 2011 in response to a public comment arguing that a 2-year waiver violated \nSection 112(f)(4) because an “unacceptable” risk would persist during the compliance period:   \nThe  commenter  has  not  indicated  any  specific  concern  which  presents  an \n“imminent endangerment” that will occur during the two-year compliance period, \nmerely making general allegations about the risks which formed the basis of the \nEPA’s decision to promulgate regulations. Since Congress recognized that a 2-year \n-7- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 14 of 32\ncompliance  period  may  be  granted  despite  EPA’s  determining  to  promulgate \nregulations to address risk, it is clear that Congress did not contemplate that any \nrisk  addressed  by  rules  under  112(f)(2)  created  an  imminent  and  substantial \nendangerment that would preclude a 2-year compliance date.5 \nThat exact analysis applies here.  But EPA is contorting itself—in this case, and this case \nonly—to argue that the same “general allegations” of risks covered by Section 112(f) constitute an \nimminent and substantial endangerment.  If the Facility’s emissions do not present an “imminent \nendangerment,” as EPA conceded in the Proposed Rule, then there is plainly no “imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment” for purposes of this Section 303 action. \nB.  The Risk Levels Alleged By EPA In This Lawsuit Do Not Constitute An Imminent \nAnd Substantial Endangerment As A Matter Of Law. \nEPA’s fundamental allegation in this action is that chloroprene emissions from the Facility \nare causing a lifetime cancer risk of greater than 1-in-10,000, which constitutes an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 58 (R. Doc. 1).  While EPA’s threshold for imminent \nand substantial endangerment is 1-in-10,000, the highest level of risk alleged by EPA equates to a \n14-in-10,000 risk, based on concentrations measured at one monitoring location over a 45-month \nperiod before EPA filed the Complaint.  Id. ¶ 48.  As of December 8, 2023, however, the highest \nalleged concentration measured over the prior 12-months had decreased, equating to a 5.4-in-\n10,000 risk level as determined by EPA’s expert.  See 12/8/23 Vandenberg Decl. ¶ 10 (Ex. 7). \nDPE strongly disputes EPA’s claims about the cancer risk of chloroprene, but for purposes \nof this Motion, the Court can assume the above alleged risk levels are accurate and still grant \nsummary judgment.  The reason:  The lifetime risk level alleged by EPA here—be it 1-in-10,000 \nor the outdated 14-in-10,000—does not constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment as a \n \n5 EPA, Nat’l Emission Stands. for Haz. Air Pollutants: Primary Lead Smelting, Sum. of Pub. \nComment and Response at 21, Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0305 (Nov. 4, 2011) (Ex. 38). \n-8- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 15 of 32\nmatter of law.  Congressional intent expressed in Section 112, and EPA’s long-standing actions in \nimplementing Section 112, demonstrate that a risk level of 1-in-10,000 (or 14-in-10,000) cannot \nbe used as a threshold for an alleged imminent and substantial endangerment.   \n1.  In Section 112, Congress made clear that the risk levels alleged by EPA here \ndo not constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment by mandating \nthat such risks be addressed through an 18-year regulatory process.  \nIn Section 112 of the CAA, Congress created a comprehensive program to address cancer \nrisks  due  to  emissions  of  hazardous  air  pollutants  (“HAPs”)  from  industrial  facilities.  In \nSection 112, Congress imposed deadlines by which EPA was required to take several steps: \n•  Within one year after the statute was signed into law in 1990, EPA was to identify “source \ncategories”—different types of industrial facilities—that included “major sources” of such \npollutants.  42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(1). \n•  Within ten years (by 2000), EPA was to conduct rulemakings to set technology-based \nstandards to reduce HAP emissions from each source category.  Id. § 7412(d)(2). \n•  Within eight years of setting those standards, EPA was to conduct another rulemaking to \ncomplete a “residual risk review”—i.e., to evaluate the “risk to public health remaining” \nafter the implementation of the technology-based standards.  As part of this rulemaking, \nEPA was for the first time required to consider whether more stringent standards were \nneeded to address lifetime cancer risks higher than 1-in-10,000.  Id. § 7412(f)(2). \nThis means that Congress knew that people were then exposed to lifetime cancer risks \nhigher than 1-in-10,000 due to HAPs, yet Congress determined that it was acceptable to allow such \nexposure for up to 18 years.6  The premise of EPA’s action here—that this Court must immediately \norder the shutdown of the Facility to abate the risk of chloroprene—directly contradicts Congress’ \nmandate under Section 112 that the exact same risks be addressed over many years under \nSection 112.  That EPA is currently addressing those risks through the Proposed Rule simply \nunderscores the incongruity of EPA’s emergency action here. \n \n6  Congress also understood that rules promulgated under Section 112 would be subject to legal \nchallenge, potentially extending the time before implementation.  42 U.S.C. § 7412(e)(4). \n-9- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 16 of 32\nEven if Section 303 were an appropriate vehicle to address such long-term risks, EPA’s \nuse of the 1-in-10,000 risk level cannot be used to declare an emergency because it flatly \ncontradicts the purpose of Section 112’s 1-in-10,000 risk benchmark.  Congress endorsed using \nthe 1-in-10,000 risk level within the context of Section 112 rulemaking.  Section 112(f)(2)(B) \nexpressly endorsed EPA’s use of the 1-in-10,000 risk level in a 1989 rulemaking to guide what \nconstitutes an “acceptable risk” under Section 112.  54 Fed. Reg. 38,044 (Sept. 14, 1989) \n(“Benzene Rule”) (Ex. 8).7  In the Benzene Rule, EPA stated that it would “generally presume that \nif the risk to [the maximum exposed] individual is no higher than approximately one in 10 \nthousand, that risk level is considered acceptable.”  Id. at 38,045.  As made clear in the Benzene \nRule, this “presumptive” risk level of 1-in-10,000 is the beginning of EPA’s framework for \nrulemaking, which includes significant safeguards to prevent reflexive reliance on a bare number.  \nHere, however, EPA casts aside those safeguards and demands that this Court begin and end the \nanalysis based solely on the 1-in-10,000 risk level to order an immediate shutdown of the Facility.   \nIn the Benzene Rule, EPA set out a flexible process, requiring consideration of a range of \nfactors, including scientific uncertainties and weight of evidence.  Id.  EPA explained that the 1-\nin-10,000 risk level “does not necessarily reflect the true risk, but displays a conservative risk level \nwhich is an upper-bound that is unlikely to be exceeded.”  Id.  In establishing the 1-in-10,000 risk \nlevel in the Benzene Rule, EPA made clear that, “rather than a rigid line for acceptability, the \nAgency intends to weigh [the risk level] with a series of other health measures and factors.”  Id.  \nIndeed, in the Benzene Rule, EPA expressly rejected using the 1-in-10,000 risk level as a bright \n \n7 As EPA acknowledges, the Benzene Rule “remains the primary model for establishing emission \nstandards in the context of CAA Section 112(f) rulemaking.  The approach developed in this rule \nwas endorsed by Congress in the CAA’s 1990 Amendments.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(f)(2)(B).” \nEPA’s Response to Interrogatory No. 6 at 12 (Ex. 9). \n-10- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 17 of 32\nline.  Id. (declining to select “Approach C” which considered only the 1-in-10,000 risk level to \ndetermine “acceptability” without incorporating consideration of other factors).   \nSpecific to chloroprene, in 2019, EPA expressly confirmed that the 1-in-10,000 risk level \n“is not based on an evaluation of current, real world exposures,” and “is not a ‘bright line’ for \ndetermining whether a risk level is considered safe or acceptable.”  See 9/23/19 Letter from EPA \nto LDEQ at 2 (Ex. 10) (emphasis added).  But here, EPA is treating 1-in-10,000 as a “bright line” \nstandard  to  shut  down  the  Facility  immediately,  without  giving  any  consideration  to  the \nuncertainties of the science, safety, and other relevant factors.  Declaring an emergency and \nshutting down industrial facilities every time an upper-bound risk level exceeds 1-in-10,000, \nwithout bothering to consider the other relevant factors, would render meaningless the approach \nauthorized in the Benzene Rule and endorsed by Congress.  If Congress wanted to automatically \ndeem risks above 1-in-10,000 as emergencies, then Congress easily could have included such a \ndirective in Section 112(f)(2)(B), instead of mandating a rulemaking approach that requires full \nconsideration of the “many relevant factors” and takes years to complete and implement.8 \nMaking EPA’s “emergency” action here even more inexplicable is the fact that, through \nthe Proposed Rule, EPA is simultaneously pursuing a Section 112 rulemaking that specifically \naddresses chloroprene emissions from the Facility.  In both the Proposed Rule and this action, EPA \nseeks to apply the inhalation unit risk (“IUR”) for chloroprene to address the 1-in-10,000 risk level.  \nSee, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 58-59; 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,097-98 (Ex. 1).  But there is a critical difference:  \nThe Proposed Rule would allow the Facility two to three years to comply, while EPA demands in \n \n8 Congress amended Section 303 in the same bill it created the Section 112 framework endorsing \nthe Benzene Rule.  See Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2681 (Section 704 amending Section 303 \nof the CAA); see also id. 104 Stat. 2531 (Section 301 amending Section 112 of the CAA).  In so \ndoing, Congress was aware of the 1-in-10,000 risk level and plainly opted to address that risk \nthrough the rulemaking regime of Section 112 and not the emergency provisions of Section 303. \n-11- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 18 of 32\nthis action that the Facility immediately shut down and not return to operation until it can \n“demonstrate” an ability to meet the 0.2 μg/m3 ambient air standard.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,177-\n78; EPA’s Statement of Final Relief at 2 (Ex. 11).9 \nFurther, EPA’s reliance on the 1-in-10,000 risk level applicable in Section 112 rulemakings \nis particularly improper in this action because, while Section 112 may allow EPA to use “upper-\nbound” estimates of cancer risks (i.e., the “maximum plausible” estimate10), Section 303 only \nallows EPA action when a facility “is presenting” an imminent and substantial endangerment.  \nSection 303 requires EPA to show that there is an imminent risk to human health—not that there \nmight be a risk to someone residing near the Facility continuously for 70 years.  See Me. \nLobstermen’s Ass’n v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 70 F.4th 582, 599 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (vacating \nagency action relying on “worst-case scenario” assumptions because “when the Congress wants \nan agency to apply a precautionary principle, it says so”).  The higher standard of scientific \ncertainty for Section 303 comports with Section 303’s lack of procedural safeguards, like notice-\nand-comment rulemaking.   \nEPA has argued that the “notwithstanding” language in Section 303 provides EPA with the \nauthority for this action.  See, e.g., R. Doc. 94 at 5-6.  But the issue is not EPA’s authority under \nSection 303, but rather one of statutory interpretation—i.e., whether Congress intended to use \n \n9 As another example of EPA’s unexplainable inconsistency, EPA alleges in this action that 15,000 \nto 17,000 people are exposed to a cancer risk level greater than 1-in-10,000 due to the Facility’s \nchloroprene emissions.  See R. Doc. 9 at 3.  But in the Proposed Rule, EPA says that roughly 2,300 \npeople are exposed to the same risk.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,107 (Ex. 1). \n10 See, e.g., 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,103 (“Cancer UREs used in our risk assessments are those that have \nbeen developed to generally provide an upper bound estimate of risk.  That is, they represent a \n‘plausible upper limit to the true value of a quantity’ (although this is usually not a true statistical \nconfidence limit).  In some circumstances, the true risk could be as low as zero; however, in other \ncircumstances the risk could be greater.”) (Ex. 1). \n-12- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 19 of 32\nupper-bound estimates of risks higher than 1-in-10,000 as a benchmark for an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment.  The “notwithstanding” language in Section 303 plainly does not \npreclude this Court from looking to Section 112 to interpret statutory text, particularly when \nCongress simultaneously adopted the current versions of Sections 112 and 303.  See supra n.8.  \nIn sum, as the Proposed Rule demonstrates, Congress enacted Section 112 to deal with \nlong-term cancer risks and expressly endorsed using that authority to address risk levels greater \nthan 1-in-10,000.  Here, EPA is short-circuiting Section 112 by simultaneously pursuing this \nincompatible lawsuit.  If EPA were to begin addressing risks due to HAPs through emergency \nactions under Section 303, it would undermine the carefully calibrated process created by Congress \nin Section 112.  Thus, this Court should find, as a matter of law, that EPA may not use Section 303 \nto shortcut the rulemaking procedures of Section 112 and grant this Motion.  \n2.  The Benzene Rule addressed risk levels up to 60-times higher than the 1-in-\n10,000 risk level EPA relies on here, yet EPA did not allege the facilities \nresponsible  for  such  risks  were  causing  an  imminent  and  substantial \nendangerment. \nEPA admits that the Benzene Rule is “the primary model for  establishing emission \nstandards” under Section 112 and that “[t]he approach developed in [the Benzene] rule was \nendorsed by Congress in the CAA’s 1990 Amendments.”  EPA’s Response to Interrogatory No. 6 \nat 12 (Ex. 9).  This Court need look no further than the Benzene Rule—the Congressionally \nendorsed “primary model for establishing emission standards” (id.)—to find that the risk levels \nalleged by EPA in this action, which are dwarfed by the risk levels addressed in the Benzene Rule, \ndo not constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment as a matter of law.      \nThe proposed Benzene Rule was published in July 1988 to establish emission standards for \nfive categories of facilities, known as “source categories.”  53 Fed. Reg. 28,496 (July 28, 1988) \n(Ex. 12).  Of those five source categories, EPA determined that the “coke by-product recovery \n-13- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 20 of 32\nplant” category posed the highest risk, estimating a risk level of 60-in-10,000 (or 6 x 10-3), or \n60 times higher than the 1-in-10,000 risk level EPA relies upon to allege an emergency here.  Id. \nat 28,498.  That risk level is also 10 times higher than the risk EPA attributes to the Facility in the \nProposed Rule (6-in-10,000),11 more than 10 times higher than the highest risk level EPA attributes \nto the Facility in the past 12 months (5.4-in-10,000),12 and more than four times higher even than \nthe highest risk level EPA attributed to the Facility based on outdated data (14-in-10,000).13  \nDespite being far higher than any risk level alleged in this action, EPA did not assert that coke by-\nproduct  recovery  plants  were  causing  an  imminent  and  substantial  endangerment  prior  to \nimplementation of the final rule—even though, in the final Benzene Rule, EPA determined that \nthe estimated risk level was actually 70-in-10,000.14  \nIn addition to addressing substantially higher risk levels than EPA alleges in this action, in \nthe Benzene Rule proposal, EPA also estimated that far more people were exposed to risks greater \nthan 1-in-10,000.  Here, EPA estimated that, as of March 2023, 16,000 residents were exposed to \ngreater than a 1-in-10,000 risk from chloroprene.  Vandenberg Decl. ¶ 59 (R. Doc. 9-6).  Notably, \nthe Proposed Rule estimates that 2,300 people (13,700 fewer than EPA alleges here) were exposed \nto that level of risk.  88 Fed. Reg. at 25,107 (Ex. 1).  But even accepting EPA’s exaggerated \n \n11 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,107 (Ex. 1) (Table 2 showing a Facility-wide “maximum individual \ncancer risk” of 600-in-1 million, or 6-in-10,000, including from non-chloroprene sources). \n12 See 12/8/23 Vandenberg Decl. ¶ 10 (Ex. 7) (Table 1 showing maximum average concentration \nlevel between 10/28/22 and 10/2/23 of 1.08 μg/m3 or a 5.4-in-10,000 risk level). \n13 See Vandenberg Decl. ¶ 60 (R. Doc. 9-6) (“The estimated lifetime cancer risks from chloroprene \nconcentrations detected in the air at the Active monitoring sites range from 2 to 14 per 10,000 \npeople. . . .”).  EPA relied on Dr. Vandenberg to allege a maximum risk level of 14-in-10,000 in \nits Complaint.  See R. Doc. 1, ¶ 48.  \n14  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 38,051 (“There are now 36 coke by-product recovery plants . . . . The revised \nbaseline estimates of health risk indicate an MIR of 7x10-3 and an annual cancer incidence of 1 \ncase every 6 months (2 cases/year).”) (Ex. 8). \n-14- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 21 of 32\nlitigation number here, it is a mere fraction of the estimated 100,000 people exposed to risks greater \nthan 1-in-10,000 from coke by-product recovery plants.  53 Fed. Reg. at 28,498 (Table I-1 listing \nestimated population subject to “baseline” risk of 1 x 10-4 before compliance with rule) (Ex. 12). \nThese numbers simply cannot be squared with EPA’s allegations in this case.  If a 1-in-\n10,000 risk level constitutes an imminent and substantial endangerment, as EPA alleges here, then \nsurely EPA would not have tolerated such risk levels for 100,000 people in the rule that serves as \nEPA’s “primary model” for regulation of HAPs like chloroprene.  Further, by explicitly endorsing \nthe Benzene Rule (in the same legislation in which it adopted the current Section 303), Congress \nmade clear that it did not believe that industrial plants causing lifetime cancer risks higher than 1-\nin-10,000 were causing an imminent and substantial endangerment.  In the end, EPA lacks any \nlegitimate basis to argue that Congress considered a 1-in-10,000 risk level to be an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment while expressly endorsing a rule that allowed risk levels at least 60 times \nhigher to be go unaddressed between a proposed and final rule.  The risk levels alleged by EPA in \nthis action, including the highest alleged (outdated) risk of 14-in-10,000, are well within the levels \nof risk that both EPA and Congress determined are properly addressed through Section 112 \nrulemakings—not through alleged emergency actions under Section 303 seeking an immediate \nshutdown of a facility while an applicable rule under Section 112 is pending.     \n3.  EPA’s long-standing acceptance of risk levels greater than 1-in-10,000 shows \nthat such level of risk is not a permissible threshold for alleging an imminent \nand substantial endangerment. \nConsistent with the Benzene Rule, EPA has—except for this lawsuit—always accepted \nrisk levels over 1-in-10,000 without declaring an imminent and substantial endangerment.  In the \nmost recent example, in a Compliance Advisory published in March 2023 (i.e., one month after \nEPA filed this lawsuit), EPA stated:  “EPA estimates that 14 million people in just 60 urban areas \nof the United States have more than a 1-in-10,000 lifetime risk of developing cancer caused by air \n-15- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 22 of 32\npollution.”15   Yet, EPA has not seen fit to declare an imminent and substantial endangerment as \nto those 14 million people.  Likewise, EPA estimated that, as of 1996, 18% of children in the \nUnited States “lived in counties in which hazardous air pollutants combined to exceed the 1-in-\n10,000  cancer  risk  benchmark.”16    But  instead  of  declaring  an  imminent  and  substantial \nendangerment  as  to  those  millions  of  children,  EPA  lawfully  addressed  the  HAPs  through \nSection 112 rulemaking.   \nEPA provides no estimate of actual cancer risk in this lawsuit, but the Proposed Rule (using \nthe “maximum plausible” estimate of risk) estimates that without the further emissions controls \ncontemplated by the Proposed Rule there will be 0.06 cancer incidences per year due to emissions \nfrom the Facility, or approximately one cancer case every 17 years.  88 Fed. Reg. at 25,120-21 \n(Ex. 1).  Given that the Proposed Rule is anticipated to become effective beginning in just over \ntwo years (equating to less than 1/8th of a cancer by EPA’s estimate), EPA’s demand that the \nFacility shut down immediately serves no legitimate purpose in preventing cancer.  Further, after \nthe rule becomes effective, EPA estimates that cancer incidence will fall to near zero.  Id.   \nIf this Court were to accept EPA’s truly unprecedented allegation of an emergency under \nthe circumstances of this case, then comparable and far worse Section 303 emergencies would \nexist at dozens of other facilities across the country.  For example, EPA admits that 23 ethylene \noxide facilities pose risks greater than 1-in-10,000, but EPA has not alleged an emergency as to \nany of them.  See EPA’s Responses to RFA Nos. 3-4 at 6-7 (Ex. 15).17  The Proposed Rule \n \n15 EPA,  Federal Facility Compliance Under EPA’s National Enforcement and Compliance \nInitiative to Create Cleaner Air for Communities (Mar. 2023) (Ex. 13) (emphasis added). \n16 See EPA, America’s Children and the Environment Report, 2d. Ed. (Feb. 2003) at 31 (Ex. 14). \n17 See also EPA, Ethylene Oxide Risk from Commercial Sterilizers (last updated Nov. 15, 2022) \n(Ex. 16).  Notably, after EPA provided its responses to DPE’s RFA Nos. 3-4, EPA revised its \nwebpage to state that the information “is no longer current” and that “EPA has proposed two new \n-16- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 23 of 32\nestimates that 4,200 people in communities around “HON” facilities will remain at risk above 1-\nin-10,000 primarily due to ethylene oxide even after implementation of the rule. 88 Fed. Reg. at \n25,110-11 (Ex. 1).  EPA estimates that there are fifteen U.S. census tracts where ethylene oxide \nposes a higher cancer risk than chloroprene poses here.18  As with chloroprene, EPA has concluded \nthat ethylene oxide operates through a “mutagenic mode of action,” meaning that the alleged risks \nto children are higher in those fifteen tracts than in the tract in which the Facility is located.  In \nfour of those tracts the risk is more than twice as high.19  Thus, even assuming that EPA were \ncorrect (it is not) that infants near the Facility exceed the 1-in-10,000 threshold “by their second \nbirthday,” Compl. ¶ 42, then infants in at least fifteen other tracts—near other facilities—would \nexceed the same threshold even faster.  Yet EPA has seen fit to declare an emergency only here. \nWhen EPA has identified a risk level greater than 1-in-10,000 in past rulemakings, EPA \nhas never declared an imminent and substantial endangerment or otherwise limited emissions from \nthe regulated facilities during the pendency of the rulemaking process or while the rule is being \nimplemented.  In fact, EPA has issued final regulations that expressly allow for lifetime cancer \nrisks greater than 1-in-10,000.20  In many rulemakings, EPA has identified pre-compliance cancer \n \nactions to address emissions of ethylene oxide from commercial sterilizers and to reduce risks for \npeople who live, work, or go to school near these facilities.”  Id. at 2 (last visited Dec. 28, 2023).  \nTellingly, EPA has still not taken any action under Section 303 to address an alleged imminent \nand substantial endangerment relating to those facilities. \n18 See EPA, 2019 AirToxScreen: Assessment Results (last updated Dec. 27, 2023) (providing \naccess to pollutant-specific data in spreadsheet entitled 2019 AirToxScreen National Cancer Risk \nby Pollutant (xlsx) (Ex. 17) (excerpt of spreadsheet)). \n19 Id. (identifying Tracts 72123953100, 13217100300, 48141010337 and 48141010338 as having \nrisk from ethylene oxide emissions more than twice the chloroprene risk in the Facility’s tract). \n20 See 70 Fed. Reg. 19,992, 19,994 (April 15, 2005) (NESHAP for Coke Oven Batteries setting \nlifetime cancer risk from exposure to coke oven emissions at 2.7-in-10,000) (Ex. 18); 72 Fed. Reg. \n25,138, 25,143 (May 3, 2007) (NESHAP for Halogenated Solvent Cleaning settings risk level of \n2-in-10,000) (Ex. 19). \n-17- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 24 of 32\nrisks  much  higher  than  1-in-10,000  and  has  never  initiated  an  imminent  and  substantial \nendangerment action against facilities contributing to such risk.  For example, EPA has identified \nmaximum  risk  levels  of  (i)  20-in-10,000  (SOCMI  source  category),21  (ii)  60-in-10,000 \n(commercial sterilization facilities source category),22 and 20-in-10,000 (miscellaneous organic \nchemical manufacturing source category).23  For each of these source categories, EPA estimated \nthat more people were exposed to a risk level at or above 1-in-10,000 (87,000, 18,000, and 18,000 \npeople, respectively) than the 16,000 people EPA alleges in this case.  Id. \nUntil this case, EPA has never sought to shut down a facility based on a risk level exceeding \n1-in-10,000, let alone during an ongoing rulemaking process.  Facilities have always been allowed \nto operate during the rulemaking process and, once EPA issues a final rule, facilities typically have \nat least two years to make the required emission reductions.24  Again, EPA’s own rules routinely \nallow facilities to operate under circumstances that EPA here claims constitute an emergency.  The \nvery purpose of the 1-in-10,000 benchmark is to facilitate rulemaking under Section 112, not to \ncircumvent it as EPA seeks to do in this unprecedented Section 303 action.   \n \n21 88 Fed.

Reg. 49,084, 49,093 (Aug. 12, 2020) (Ex. 20) (Table 2: 18,000-in-1,000,000 risk level). \n24 For example, the Proposed Rule would give ethylene oxide sources, some of which have risk \nestimates higher than chloroprene, two years to comply.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at 25,178 (Ex. 1).  \n-18- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 25 of 32\n4.  EPA’s decision not to take “emergency” action against the Facility for seven \nyears simply underscores EPA’s long-standing position that a 1-in-10,000 risk \nlevel does not constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment. \nEPA has authority to act under Section 303 only “upon receipt of evidence” of an \n“imminent and substantial endangerment.”  42 U.S.C. § 7603.  It is undisputed that, since \nDecember 2015, EPA has possessed evidence that, according to EPA, shows the Facility’s \nchloroprene emissions cause a lifetime cancer risk greater than 1-in-10,000.  Yet EPA deliberately \nwaited over seven years—until February 2023, when the Facility’s chloroprene emissions had been \nreduced by 85% compared to 2015 levels—to bring this Section 303 action.  The following \nundisputed facts completely undermine EPA’s assertion in this action that a 1-in-10,000 risk level \nis a lawful threshold for an imminent and substantial endangerment: \n•  In December 2015, with the release of the 2011 NATA, EPA possessed evidence \nof what it now claims to be an imminent and substantial endangerment due to chloroprene \nemissions from the Facility.  See EPA’s Response to Interrogatory No. 3 at 7 (Ex. 21).   \n•  In January 2016, EPA believed its modeling using the Facility’s 2014 emissions \ndata showed risk levels much higher than 1-in-10,000.  Id.  According to James Leathers, who \nverified EPA’s response to Interrogatory No. 3, EPA could have declared an imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment based on that 2016 modeling.  Leathers Tr. at 127:11-128:13 (Ex. 22). \n•  As of May and August 2016, when EPA and DPE, respectively, began air sampling \nat the Facility, EPA had further evidence of what it now claims is an imminent and substantial \nendangerment and could have brought a Section 303 action.  EPA’s Response to Interrogatory \nNo. 3 at 8 (Ex. 21); Leathers Tr. at 131:9-132:10 (Ex. 22).  As of August 2016, “the monitoring \nresults [EPA was] seeing [were] pointing to a 10-3 risk in LaPlace, or a 1/1,000 risk of getting \ncancer in a lifetime.”  8/10/16 EPA Email (Ex. 23) (emphasis added).  In other words, seven years \n-19- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 26 of 32\nago, EPA observed ten times the risk level it now says constitutes an emergency.  Mr. Leathers \nagreed that the monitoring data from 2016 through 2021 “showed chloroprene concentrations that \nwere an order of magnitude higher than EPA’s 2010 high risk value for chloroprene.”  Leathers \nTr. at 140:13-141:14 (Ex. 22).   \n•  As early as July 2016—seven years before filing this action—EPA was actively \nreviewing with the Department of Justice a potential Section 303 action against DPE.  7/5/16 EPA \nEmail (Ex. 24).   \n•  On November 13, 2017, law professor Mark Squillace demanded that EPA declare \na Section 303 emergency at the Facility, arguing that residents were exposed “to chloroprene levels \nthat far exceed the levels that EPA deems … acceptable.”  See 11/13/17 Letter from Squillace to \nEPA (Ex. 25); Leathers Tr. at 149:3-11 (Ex. 22).  Indeed, Mr. Leathers testified that EPA had \nevidence of “an emergency” nine months before Prof. Squillace’s demand letter, Leathers Tr. at \n178:5-12, and that EPA could have declared an emergency at that time but chose not to.  Id. at \n151:13-152:6 (Ex. 22).   \n•  Instead of pursuing a Section 303 action, EPA touted the emission reductions that \nthe Facility agreed to make under the January 2017 Administrative Order on Consent (“AOC”) \nreached between LDEQ and DPE, with EPA’s support.  See 12/15/17 Letter from EPA to Squillace \n(Ex. 26).  In fact, internal EPA documents show that, when the AOC was finalized in January \n2017, “EPA determined that an [imminent and substantial endangerment] order was not the path \nforward.”   EPA chronology at EPA_0827743 (Ex. 27) (emphasis added); see also 10/23/17 EPA \nEmail (Ex. 28); Leathers Tr. at 180:3-25; 181:20-183:5 (Ex. 22).  Instead of pursuing a Section 303 \naction, “EPA and DOJ advised and consulted LDEQ on their [AOC],” which “requires Denka to \nreduce chloroprene by 85% from 2014 emissions levels, most of which will be achieved through \n-20- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 27 of 32\na regenerative thermal oxidizer [“RTO”] to be installed by the end of 2017.”  (Ex. 28).  It is \nundisputed this equipment was installed and achieved the anticipated emission reductions.  See \nEPA Summary Report at 1 (Ex. 39) (EPA touting 85% reduction in emissions due to RTO). \n•  When EPA decided in January 2017 that a Section 303 action was “not the path \nforward,” EPA knew that the emission reductions required under the AOC would not reduce \nchloroprene concentrations to the 0.2 μg/m3 level that EPA now claims as the standard for abating \nan emergency.  Leathers Tr. at 176:3-8; 187:9-19 (Ex. 22); see also 1/12/18 Letter from Squillace \nto EPA (Ex. 29) (noting EPA’s acknowledgment that reductions required by AOC would not \nachieve 0.2 μg/m3).  Mr. Leathers confirmed that as of August 2020, after the RTO was running, \nEPA knew the Facility’s chloroprene concentrations were still well above the 0.2 μg/m3 level and \nEPA had roughly four years of robust monitoring data.  Leathers Tr. at 191:3-192:22 (Ex. 22). \n•  In May 2021, almost four years after Prof. Squillace’s 2017 demand letter, local \nactivists petitioned EPA to take emergency action under Section 303, alleging “a grave health \nemergency” due to chloroprene concentration levels “as high as 16.0 μg/m3 in St. John.”  Petition \nto EPA at 1 (Ex. 30).  EPA still declined to bring a Section 303 action, despite having data showing \nchloroprene concentrations of an order of magnitude higher than the 0.2 μg/m3 level.   Leathers Tr. \nat 140:13-141:14 (Ex. 22).   \n•  EPA waited two more years, until February 2023, to bring this action—a time when \nthe Facility’s emission levels had dramatically decreased and seven years after EPA undisputedly \npossessed sufficient evidence of what it now claims to be an emergency.  Even based on EPA’s \nmonitoring expert, fenceline concentrations during the period from October 2022 and October \n2023 decreased at all active monitoring locations as compared to the period from April 2018 to \n-21- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 28 of 32\nOctober 2023, with decreases ranging between 29% and 63%.  12/8/23 Vandenberg Decl. ¶ 10, \nTable 1 (Ex. 7).     \nIn short, it is inconceivable that there is suddenly an emergency in 2023 warranting an \nimmediate shutdown of the Facility when emissions are more than 85% lower than when EPA first \nreceived evidence supporting what it now claims to be an imminent and substantial endangerment.  \nWhy did EPA fail to assert such a claim for seven years while possessing evidence of chloroprene \nemissions “an order of magnitude higher” than they are today?  The reason is simple: until it filed \nthis action, EPA had never taken the position, and did not actually believe, that a 1-in-10,000 risk \nlevel constitutes a defensible threshold for a claim of imminent and substantial endangerment.    \nC.  EPA’s Chloroprene IUR Cannot Be Used As A Threshold For Alleging Imminent \nAnd Substantial Endangerment Because EPA Expressly Admits That The IUR Is \nBased On A Default Assumption That EPA Has No Evidence To Substantiate. \nEPA claims that a lifetime of exposure to 0.2 μg/m3 of chloroprene increases a human’s \nrisk of developing cancer by 1-in-10,000.  This claim rests on a default assumption that humans \nare as susceptible to certain types of cancer as a particular species of female mice.  Regardless of \nwhether this default assumption was appropriate for the IRIS program to apply in the 2010 \nassessment of chloroprene (“2010 Review”) (which DPE disputes), EPA has not met its burden of \nproof in this lawsuit.  EPA has no evidence to substantiate this critical default assumption, which \nresults in the unfounded use of the highest possible risk value.  In this action, where EPA bears the \nburden of proof, it may not “rely[] upon worst-case scenarios or pessimistic assumptions” with no \nsupporting empirical evidence.  See Me. Lobstermen’s Ass’n, 70 F.4th at 586, 599.   \nIn the 2010 Review, EPA estimated the IUR based solely on a 1998 National Toxicology \nProgram study (“NTP Study”) of female B6C3F1 mice.  See EPA’s Response to RFA No. 17 at \n18 (Ex. 15).  Purely as a matter of policy, EPA estimates human IURs based on the IUR for the \n-22- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 29 of 32\nmost sensitive animal sex and species if (i) EPA does not identify a “clearly most relevant species” \nand (ii) no adequate human data are available.  EPA’s guidance document states:  \nAlthough it is preferable to use human studies as the basis for the dose-response \nderivation, adequate human data are not always available, often forcing reliance on \nlaboratory animal data. Presented with data from several animal studies, the risk \nassessor first seeks to identify the animal model that is most relevant to humans, \nbased on comparability of biological effects using the most defensible biological \nrationale; for instance, by using comparative metabolic, pharmacokinetic, and \npharmacodynamic data. In the absence of a clearly most relevant species, however, \nthe most sensitive species is used as a matter of science policy at the EPA.25   \n \nBy its terms, this policy only applies “in the absence of a clearly most relevant species” to humans.  \nWhile DPE can demonstrate that a different animal in the NTP Study was the “clearly most \nrelevant species” based on toxicokinetic data, that point need not be addressed to decide this \nMotion.  But this Motion should be granted because there is no dispute that EPA failed to determine \nthat  the  2010  IUR  is  based  on  data  most  relevant  to  human  risk.    As  the  2010  Review \nacknowledges, the IUR derived from female B6C3F1 mice studies was not based on data that \nallows for any adjustments to reflect the differences in risks applicable to mice versus humans:  \nThe calculated composite unit risk is based on the most sensitive endpoint (risk of \nany tumor type) in the most sensitive species and sex (female mouse). There is no \ninformation on chloroprene to indicate that the observed rodent tumors are not \nrelevant to humans. Further, no data exist to guide quantitative adjustment for \ndifferences in sensitivity among rodents and humans.   \n \n2010 Review at 141 (Ex. 33) (emphases added).    \nEPA’s  burden  in  this  lawsuit  is  to  prove  that  there  is  an  imminent  and  substantial \nendangerment to humans.  Dr. Kristina Thayer, who leads the IRIS program, admitted that “EPA \nhas . . . no idea of the true correspondence of the [B6C3F1] mouse to human response.”  Thayer \n \n25 EPA, Methods for Derivation of Inhalation Reference Concentrations and Application of \nInhalation Dosimetry (Oct. 1994) at 1-5 (Ex. 31) (emphases added).  EPA’s expert, Dr. Ila Cote, \nconfirmed that, “in the absence of data to the contrary, the agency will use the most sensitive end \npoint, which generally means the most sensitive [sex and] species.”  Cote Tr. 20:1-6 (Ex. 32). \n-23- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 30 of 32\nTr. 63:5-21; 154:11-14 (Ex. 34); see also 2010 Review at 139 (Ex. 33) (true correspondence of \nB6C3F1 mouse to human is “unknown”).  And EPA admits that, since the 2010 Review, it has \nperformed no new analysis to determine that the 2010 IUR provides a risk estimate representative \nof human risk, resting instead on its unsupported “default” assumption that bases the IUR on the \nhighest possible risk level.  EPA’s Response to Interrogatory No. 18 at 20 (Ex. 4) (“EPA’s analysis \nrelating to its use of the B6C3F1 mouse data in calculating the IUR in the 2010 IRIS Assessment, \nand  the  analysis  EPA  performed  to  determine  that  the  B6C3F1  mouse  data  was  the  most \nrepresentative information available to understand potential human responses to chloroprene is \ncontained in the 2010 IRIS Assessment....”) (emphasis added).  \nEPA’s response to Interrogatory No. 18 states that EPA’s decision to rely on the B6C3F1 \nfemale mouse to calculate the IUR was “described and reflected” in EPA’s decisions on three \nadministrative appeals that DPE filed to correct the 2010 Review.  Id.  But those administrative \ndecisions included no determination whatsoever of the sex/species most relevant to humans, but \ninstead simply relied on the same unsubstantiated default assumption as the 2010 Review.26   \nEPA’s response to Interrogatory No. 18 states that EPA’s decision to rely on the B6C3F1 \nfemale mouse to calculate the IUR is “discussed” in the expert declarations of Dr. Ila Cote.  Id.  at \n21.  But EPA does not suggest that it relies on Dr. Cote for its decision to calculate the IUR using \nthe B6C3F1 female mouse.  Moreover, Dr. Cote only opines that the female B6C3F1 data is \n“appropriate” based on statistical suitability criteria set forth in a draft EPA document.27  Dr. Cote \n \n26 See, e.g., EPA Response to DPE’s Request for Correction (Jan. 2018), Attachment 1 at 3 (Ex. \n35) (“In accordance with the EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (2005), in the \nabsence of data to the contrary, EPA utilizes the most sensitive species and sex in estimating cancer \nrisk to humans, which in the case of chloroprene, is the female mouse.”). \n27 See Cote Decl., ¶ 16 (R. Doc. 94-7) (comparing the NTP Study characteristics with criteria \nprovided in the fourth of four elements for selecting an animal data set but failing to address the \nfirst three elements and failing to reach a judgment “based on biological criteria as to which set or \n-24- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 31 of 32\noffers no determination as to “which set or sets [of data] best represents the body of data for the \npurpose of estimating human response.”  Id.  That is the question on which EPA offers no evidence. \nIn contrast, DPE has offered evidence in support of inhalation risk estimates that are more \nrepresentative of human risk than the 2010 Review IUR.28  Such evidence is not a matter for \nsummary judgment.  But the point is, EPA offers no evidence (e.g., biological or toxicokinetic \ndata) to support using the B6C3F1 mouse as representative of humans.  Because EPA has failed \nto meet its burden of proof on this essential aspect of its claim of an imminent and substantial \nendangerment, this Court can grant summary judgment.  Simsbury-Avon Preservation Club, 575 \nF.3d at 211-12 (affirming summary judgment where expert report failed to assess actual risk \npresented by contaminants at issue). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, DPE’s Motion should be granted and EPA’s claims dismissed. \n \n   \n \nsets best represents the body of data for the purpose of estimating human response”).  Dr. Cote \nrepresents that the incomplete criteria she evaluates is part of a National Academy of Sciences \ncriteria, but it is in fact a draft EPA document included as an Appendix to the cited report.  See \nNational Research Council, Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment (1994) at 428-29 (Section \n3.2.1 in Appendix D, “Working Paper for Considering Draft Revisions to the U.S. EPA Guidelines \nfor Cancer Risk Assessment.”) (Ex. 36). \n28 For example, DPE’s expert, Dr. Michael Lumpkin, relies on toxicokinetic data to explain why \nthe B6C3F1 female mouse is not representative of humans.  See, e.g., Lumpkin Decl. ¶ 38 (Ex. 37). \n-25- \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 131-2     Filed 12/29/23     Page 32 of 32\nDated:  December 29, 2023  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nJONES WALKER LLP    /s/ David A.

Estimates are impacts \nfor the 15 year analytic period from 2024-2038 (inclusive). PV and EAV estimates are \ndiscounted to 2024. \n2 Monetized health benefits include ozone related health benefits associated with reductions in \nVOC emissions in the ozone season. The health benefits are associated with several point \nestimates and are presented at real discount rates of 3 and 7 percent. The two benefits estimates \nare separated by the word \"and\" to signify that they are two separate estimates. The estimates do \nnot represent lower- and upper-bound estimates. Benefits from HAP reductions and VOC \nreductions outside of the ozone season remain unmonetized and are thus not reflected in the \ntable. The unmonetized effects also include disbenefits resulting from the secondary impact of an \nincrease in CO emissions. \n3 Monetized climate benefits and disbenefits are based on increases in CO2 and N2O emissions \nand decreases in CH4 emissions and are calculated using three different estimates of the social \ncost of each greenhouse gas (SC-GHG) (under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent near \nterm Ramsey discount rates). For the presentational purposes of this table, we show the net \ndisbenefits associated with the SC-GHG at a 2 percent near-term Ramsey discount rate. \nS2 4Net compliance costs are the engineering control costs minus the value of recovered product. \nE\nUL A negative net compliance costs occurs when the value of the recovered product exceeds the \nR\nwith  compliance costs. \nD \nO\nR\nP\nN23\nR\nmheller on DSK120 MY24.024</GPH>\nddruVerDate Sep<11>2014  18:26 May 15, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00130 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4725 E:\\FR\\FM\\16MYR2.SGM 16MYR2 ER16\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 89, No. 96/Thursday, May 16, 2024/Rules and Regulations  43061 \nB.

The health benefits are associated with several point \nestimates and are presented at real discount rates of 3 and 7 percent. The two benefits estimates \nare separated by the word \"and\" to signify that they are two separate estimates. The estimates do \nnot represent lower- and upper-bound estimates. Benefits from HAP reductions and VOC \nreductions outside of the ozone season remain unmonetized and are thus not reflected in the \ntable. The unmonetized effects also include disbenefits resulting from the secondary impact of an \nincrease in CO emissions. \n3 Monetized climate benefits and disbenefits are based on increases in CO2 and N2O emissions \nand decreases in CH4 emissions and are calculated using three different estimates of the social \ncost of each greenhouse gas (SC-GHG) (under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent near \nterm Ramsey discount rates).
