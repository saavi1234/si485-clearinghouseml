    "summary": "<p>This case challenged Houston County, Georgia's method of electing its Board of Commissioners.</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2025, the United States of America filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against Houston County and several members of the Houston County Board of Commissioners. Plaintiff alleged that defendants violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) by using a method to elect the Board of Commissioners that diluted the voting strength of Black citizens, giving them less opportunity than others to choose representatives. Specifically, the United States alleged that the Black population of Houston County was politically cohesive, and the White population voted as a bloc to usually defeat the preferred candidate of Black voters. Thus, only one Black citizen had been voted into office since the end of Reconstruction in 1876.</p>\r\n<p>The United States sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining defendants from administering, implementing, or conducting any future elections under the current method of election; and an order for defendants to devise and implement an election system that complied with Section 2 of the VRA. The case was assigned to Judge Marc Thomas Treadwell.</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2025, several Black voters in Houston County filed a motion to intervene, arguing that the United States inadequately represented their interest and that they shared an interest in the litigation as voters affected by the current election method. The court granted the motion to intervene on March 4, finding that the intervenors could offer new evidence that may shed additional light on the issue. 2025 WL 694458. The following day, the intervenor-plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking similar relief to the United States, as well as attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on March 17, 2025. Defendants argued that the United States sued the wrong party, as defendants did not administer the elections in Houston County and did not adopt the countywide method of election, nor would enjoining them change the current method of electing commissioners.</p>\r\n<p>However, on March 24, 2025, the United States flipped its position and filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. While the United States did not specify why it decided to dismiss the case, the dismissal dovetails with the Trump Administration's dismissal of most voting rights litigation brought by the Biden Administration. The case was closed the following day; it was reopened the same day, however, in light of the intervenor plaintiffs' complaint. Two days later, defendants filed a motion to dismiss intervenor-plaintiffs' complaint. On April 15, in light of the United States' withdrawal from the case, the case was renamed&nbsp;<em>Driver v. Houston County Board of Elections.</em></p>\r\n<p>The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss on September 2, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs allegations created a basis for subject matter jurisdiction and their stated claims for relief were all &ldquo;plausible on [their] face.&rdquo; 2025 WL 2523719.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery is ongoing as of October 8.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenges how Houston County, Georgia, elects its Board of Commissioners.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 2025, the United States filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against Houston County and several members of its Board of Commissioners. The government claimed that the county’s at-large election system violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by weakening the voting power of Black residents. The complaint said Black voters were politically unified, while White voters often voted together to defeat their preferred candidates. As a result, only one Black person had been elected to the board since 1876. The United States asked the court to block future elections under the current system and order a new, fairer one.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, several Black voters asked to join the case, arguing that the federal government did not fully represent their interests. The court allowed them to intervene on March 4, and they filed their own complaint the next day.\r\n\r\nOn March 17, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing that they were not the right parties to sue because they did not run county elections or create the election system. A week later, on March 24, the United States voluntarily dropped out of the lawsuit, part of a broader shift by the Trump Administration away from voting rights cases. The local voters continued the suit under the new name Driver v. Houston County Board of Elections.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 2025, the judge denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The case remains ongoing as of October 8, 2025.",

The United States files this action pursuant to Section 2 and Section 12(d) of the \nVoting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301 and 10308(d). \n2.

This Court has original jurisdiction of this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345, \nand 2201(a) and 52 U.S.C. § 10308(f). \n5.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §§ 90(b)(2) and 1391(b). \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 2 of 9\nPARTIES \n6.  The Voting Rights Act authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil action on \nbehalf of the United States of America seeking injunctive, preventive, and permanent relief for \nviolations of Section 2 of the Act.  52 U.S.C. § 10308(d). \n7.  Defendant Houston County is a political and geographical subdivision of the State \nof Georgia. \n8.  Defendants Dan Perdue, Shane Gottwals, Gail Robinson, Tal Talton, and Mark \nByrd are elected members of the Houston County Board of Commissioners, the governing \nauthority of Houston County for purposes of legislation and policy-making.  Houston Cnty. \nRelated Laws art. I, § 1.7.  They are sued in their official capacities. \nALLEGATIONS \n9.  The current method of electing the Houston County Board of Commissioners \ndilutes the voting strength of Black citizens, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \n10.  The Houston County Board of Commissioners has five members, elected in \nstaggered at-large contests for four-year terms.  Houston Cnty. Related Laws art. I, § 1.2.  Each \nmember is elected to a numbered Post, with the commissioner elected from Post 1 serving as \nchairman.  Id. §§ 1.2, 1.5(b).   \n11.

Voters \nmay cast one vote for a candidate running for election to each numbered Post. \n   \n2 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 3 of 9\nHouston County Demographics and Geography \n \n12.  According to the 2020 Census, Houston County has a population of 163,633, \nincluding 86,211 White persons (52.7%) and 54,148 Black persons (33.1%).1  Houston County \nalso has a voting-age population of 122,118, including 68,018 White persons (55.7%) and 38,329 \nBlack persons (31.4%).   \n13.  Houston County contains geographically and socially distinct Black and White \ncommunities, with the Black community concentrated in north and east Warner Robins.  \nChurches and other community organizations also reflect racial separation. \n14.  The 2018-2022 American Community Survey estimated that Houston County had \na citizen voting-age population of 118,735, including 69,195 White persons (58.3%) and 37,405 \nBlack persons (31.5%). \n15.  There are approximately 105,000 active registered voters in Houston County, \nincluding approximately 58,000 White registered voters (55%) and approximately 32,000 Black \nregistered voters (30%).   \n16.  White registered voters in Houston County turn out to vote at significantly higher \nrates than Black registered voters in Houston County. \n17.  The Black population of Houston County is sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact to constitute a majority of the voting-age population and the citizen \nvoting-age population in a single-member district for the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners under a five-district plan.   \n \n1 As used herein, the term “White” denotes White non-Hispanic persons and the term “Black” \ndenotes Black non-Hispanic persons. \n3 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 4 of 9\n18.  In a five-district plan drawn using traditional redistricting principles, a majority-\nBlack district may be crafted that includes neighborhoods in the northern and eastern portions of \nthe City of Warner Robins and apartment complexes along Carl Vinson Parkway.   \n19.  Analysis of votes cast within such majority-Black district in a five-district plan \nindicates that Black-preferred Black candidates would have won a majority of votes in the most \nrecent contest between a Black candidate and a White candidate for the Houston County Board \nof Commissioners, as well as in other interracial countywide contests.  Thus, Black voters would \nhave the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates in elections conducted solely within the \nboundaries of such a district.   \n20.  The Black population of Houston County is also sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact to constitute a majority of the voting-age population and citizen voting-\nage population in a single-member district for the Houston County Board of Commissioners \nunder a four-district plan. \n21.  In a four-district plan drawn using traditional redistricting principles, a majority-\nBlack district may be crafted that includes neighborhoods in the northern and eastern portions of \nthe City of Warner Robins, apartment complexes along Carl Vinson Parkway, and additional \nracially diverse neighborhoods in southern Warner Robins.   \n22.  Analysis of votes cast within such majority-Black district in a four-district plan \nalso indicates that Black-preferred Black candidates would have won a majority of votes in the \nmost recent general election contest between a Black candidate and a White candidate for the \nHouston County Board of Commissioners, as well as in other interracial countywide contests.   \nThus, Black voters would have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates in elections \nconducted solely within the boundaries of such a district.   \n4 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 5 of 9\nElections for the Houston County Board of Commissioners \n \n23.  Since Reconstruction, only one Black candidate, Houston Porter, has been elected \nto the Houston County Board of Commissioners. \n24.  After an unsuccessful campaign in 1978, Porter was elected to the Houston \nCounty Board of Commissioners in 1980.  Porter defeated an incumbent in a primary runoff \nelection by only 49 votes and was uncontested in the general election.  Porter was reelected in \n1984 and 1988 and declined to seek reelection in 1992. \n25.  Black candidates ran for the Houston County Board of Commissioners in 1992, \n1994, 2002, 2016, 2020, and 2022.  During this period, Black candidates have run as Democrats, \nas a Republican, and as an independent.  All were defeated in partisan primaries or general \nelections.  \n26.  In elections for the Houston County Board of Commissioners, the Black \npopulation of Houston County is politically cohesive, and the White population votes sufficiently \nas a bloc to usually defeat the preferred candidate of Black voters. \n27.  Black voters consistently vote for Black candidates for the Houston County Board \nof Commissioners.   \n28.  Since 2002, at least 85% of Black voters have supported Black candidates in \ngeneral elections for the Houston County Board of Commissioners.   \n29.  Although relatively few Black voters have participated in Republican primaries, \nmost of the Black voters who did participate in the 2022 Republican primary supported a Black \nRepublican candidate for the Houston County Board of Commissioners. \n5 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 6 of 9\n30.  In contests between Black candidates and White candidates for the Houston \nCounty Board of Commissioners, White voters cast their ballots sufficiently as a bloc to defeat \nBlack voters’ preferred candidate. \n31.  Since 2002, fewer than one-fourth of White voters supported Black-preferred \nBlack candidates in general elections for the Board of Commissioners.  Since 2016, fewer than \none in ten White voters have supported Black-preferred Black candidates in general elections for \nthe Board of Commissioners.  As a result, each Black-preferred Black candidate was defeated. \n32.  Even when a Black candidate has run as a Republican and received majority \nsupport from participating Black voters in the primary election, less than one-fourth of White \nvoters supported that candidate in that primary.  As a result, this Black-preferred Black candidate \nwas defeated.  \nAdditional Countywide Elections in Houston County \n \n33.  Since 2014, four Black candidates have sought Houston County offices and \nseveral Black candidates have run for countywide seats on the Houston County Board of \nEducation.   \n34.  Despite cohesive Black support for Black candidates for Houston County offices, \nBlack candidates for Houston County offices were uniformly defeated in general elections, due \nto White bloc voting. \n35.  Despite cohesive Black support for Black candidates for countywide seats on the \nHouston County Board of Education, most Black candidates for countywide seats on the \nHouston County Board of Education were defeated in nonpartisan runoff elections, due to White \nbloc voting.  No Black candidate for a countywide seat on the Houston County Board of \nEducation has received the support of most White voters in a nonpartisan runoff election. \n6 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 7 of 9\nAdditional Relevant Circumstances in Houston County  \n \n36.  Houston County has a history of official discrimination that affected the right of \nBlack residents to register, to vote, and to participate meaningfully in the democratic process.  \nThis includes all-White county elected officials governing a majority-Black population from the \nend of Reconstruction into the 1940s, discriminatory at-large municipal elections, segregated \neducation and resistance to effective desegregation, and racially discriminatory incidents across \nvarious levels of government. \n37.  Racially-charged incidents persist in Houston County.  In the last year alone, \nstudents at a local high school were filmed mimicking the Ku Klux Klan, and the Houston \nCounty School District agreed to implement anti-discrimination training after acknowledging \nracial harassment and retaliation concerns arising from an athletic coach’s conduct.   \n38.  The Black population of Houston County continues to suffer from the effects of \ndiscrimination in education, health, and employment, including public employment.  Resulting \nsocioeconomic disparities hinder the ability of Black residents to participate effectively in the \npolitical process.   \n39.  Although Black residents in Houston County are only marginally less likely than \nWhite residents to have attended a college or university, Houston County schools continue to \nproduce inferior outcomes for Black students, as measured through enrollment in AP courses, \nschool discipline, and academic non-promotion.   \n40.  Black residents in Houston County are more than twice as likely as White \nresidents to experience poverty, roughly twice as likely to be unemployed, and substantially less \nlikely to be employed by the County, particularly in higher-paying positions.  Black residents are \n7 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 8 of 9\nalso less likely than White residents to be in “Excellent,” “Very Good,” or “Good” health and are \nless likely to have financial reserves needed to address health emergencies. \n41.  Elections for the Houston County Board of Commissioners are characterized by \npractices and procedures that impair Black voters’ opportunity to elect commissioners of choice.  \nThese include, but are not limited to, the use of numbered posts, staggered terms, and runoff \nelections. \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n42.  Under the totality of circumstances, the current method of electing the Houston \nCounty Board of Commissioners results in Black citizens having less opportunity than other \nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of \ntheir choice, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301.   \n43.  Unless enjoined by order of this Court, Defendants will continue violating Section \n2 of the Voting Rights Act by administering, implementing, and conducting future elections for \nthe Houston County Board of Commissioners using this method of election. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the United States prays that the Court enter an order: \n(1)  Declaring that the current method of electing the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301; \n(2)  Enjoining Defendants, their agents and successors in office, and all persons acting \nin concert with them from administering, implementing, or conducting any future \nelections for the Houston County Board of Commissioners under the current \nmethod of election; \n(3)  Ordering Defendants to devise and implement an election system for the Houston \n8 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 1     Filed 01/16/25     Page 9 of 9\nCounty Board of Commissioners that complies with Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act; and  \n(4)  Granting such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \nDate: January 16, 2025 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n \n              KRISTEN CLARKE \n              Assistant Attorney General \n              Civil Rights Division \n \n              /s/ Daniel J.

Doc. 1.  Courtney Driver and Michael Jones allege \nthat they are Black registered voters in Houston County, Georgia, and seek to intervene \nin the underlying action.  Docs. 7; 7-1 ¶¶ 5–6.  The United States opposes intervention \nas of right but does not oppose permissive intervention.  Doc. 10.  The defendants \n(collectively, “Houston County”) oppose both theories of intervention.  Doc. 11.  For the \nreasons that follow, the motion to intervene is GRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \n  Driver and Jones argue that they are entitled to intervene as of right because \ntheir motion is timely given that it was filed shortly after the United States’ complaint; \nthey have a clear interest in the litigation because they could bring this action by \nthemselves; excluding Driver and Jones would deprive them of a say in the method of \nelecting their county government; and the United States inadequately represents their \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 13     Filed 03/04/25     Page 2 of 4\ninterests.  Doc. 7 at 5–6.  In the alternative, Driver and Jones argue that the Court \nshould allow permissive intervention because the motion to intervene is timely; their \nclaim has questions of law and fact in common with the underlying action; and \nintervention would not unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of any party’s rights.  \nId. at 7.  \n  Houston County argues that Driver and Jones are not entitled to intervention as \nof right because (1) they have not stated a legal interest in the pending litigation; (2) \nthey would not be disadvantaged by exclusion; and (3) the United States adequately \nrepresents their interests.1  Doc. 11 at 2.  As to permissive intervention, Houston County \nasks the Court to exercise its discretion against Driver and Jones because their “claims \ndo not add any additional material information” and because they “can easily be called \nas witnesses … and present evidence” if this case moves forward.  Id. at 10.   \nII. DISCUSSION \nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for intervention as of \nright, and Rule 24(b) provides for permissive intervention in the Court's discretion.  To \nintervene as of right, a movant must satisfy four requirements: “(1) his application to \nintervene is timely; (2) he has an interest relating to the property or transaction which is \nthe subject of the action; (3) he is so situated that disposition of the action, as a practical \nmatter, may impede or impair his ability to protect that interest; and (4) his interest is \nrepresented inadequately by the existing parties to the suit.”  Purcell v. Bank Atlantic \nFin. Corp., 85 F.3d 1508, 1512 (11th Cir. 1996).  “When the party seeking intervention \nhas the same ultimate objective as a party to the suit, a presumption arises that its \n \n1 Houston County does not contest the timeliness of the motion.  Doc. 11 at 2.  \n-2- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 13     Filed 03/04/25     Page 3 of 4\ninterests are adequately represented, against which the petitioner must demonstrate \nadversity of interest, collusion, or nonfeasance.”  Int'l Tank Terminals, Ltd. v. M/V \nAcadia Forest, 579 F.2d 964, 967 (5th Cir. 1978).2  \nRule 24(b) provides for permissive intervention if the motion is timely and the \nintervening party “has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common \nquestion of law or fact.”  “If there is no right to intervene under Rule 24(a), it is wholly \ndiscretionary with the court whether to allow intervention under Rule 24(b).”  Purcell, 85 \nF.3d at 1513 (citation omitted).  Courts ask two questions when considering whether to \nallow permissive intervention.  First, whether “the applicant’s claim or defense and the \nmain action have a common question of law or fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B); \nStallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 269 (5th Cir. 1977).  Second, whether \nintervention should be allowed in light of potential undue delay or prejudice to the \nexisting parties.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3); Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 269.    \nHere, Driver and Jones argue that the Court should grant permissive intervention \nunder Rule 24(b).  The Court agrees.  Houston County does not dispute that Driver and \nJones satisfy the requirements for permissive intervention.  Doc. 11 at 10.  Instead, \nHouston County argues that the Court should nonetheless deny permissive intervention \nbecause it is “‘unlikely that any new light will be shed on the issues to be adjudicated.’”  \nId. (quoting Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir.1989)).   \nThe Court finds that Driver and Jones seek to offer evidence that could shed a \ndifferent light on issues before this Court.  See Doc. 7-1 at 5, 7.  Thus, the Court sees \n \n2 The Eleventh Circuit has adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered \nprior to October 1, 1981.  Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). \n \n-3- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 13     Filed 03/04/25     Page 4 of 4\nno basis to deny intervention in its discretion and concludes that Driver and Jones are \nentitled to permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).3  Accordingly, the motion to \nintervene (Doc. 7) is GRANTED.     \nSO ORDERED, this 4th day of March, 2025.  \n \nS/ Marc T.

      "text": "Case 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA \nMACON DIVISION \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \nPlaintiff, \nv.  Civil Action No. 5:25-cv-0025-MTT \nHOUSTON COUNTY, et al., \nDefendants. \nCOUNTY DEFENDANTS’ BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO \nDISMISS COMPLAINT \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is an enforcement action originally brought by the Attorney \nGeneral  under  the  Voting  Rights  Act  (VRA)  challenging  the  countywide \nmethod of election of the five-member Board of Commissioners of Houston \nCounty. [Doc. 1]. DOJ claims that the current method of at-large elections for \ncommissioners “dilutes the voting strength of Black voters in violation of the \nVRA.” [Doc. 1 at ¶ 3]. It seeks an injunction to prevent the continued use of \n“the  current  method  of  election”  against  only  Houston  County  and  the \nindividual members of the Board of Commissioners in their official capacities. \n[Doc. 1 at 8]. And while the Attorney General has a right to file such an action \nunder 52 U.S.C. § 10308(d), he cannot proceed in this case because he has not \nsued the correct party. Houston County and the individual members of the \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 2 of 7\nBoard do not administer the elections in Houston County and did not adopt the \ncountywide method of election. And enjoining them cannot change the current \nmethod of election of commissioners as DOJ seeks. This Court therefore lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction to hear DOJ’s claim and the Complaint should be \ndismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  \nARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY \nI. Legal standard. \nWhen  considering  motions  to  dismiss  for  lack  of  subject-matter \njurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), the court need not look beyond the \ncomplaint and all the allegations contained in it “are taken as true for the \npurposes of the motion.” Lawrence v. Dunbar, 919 F.2d 1525, 1528–29 (11th \nCir. 1990) (internal citations omitted). And “[o]nce a federal court determines \nthat  it  is  without  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  the  court  is  powerless  to \ncontinue.” Univ. of S. Alabama v. Am. Tobacco Co., 168 F.3d 405, 410 (11th \nCir. 1999). \nII. This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Complaint. \nA. DOJ’s  claims are not  traceable to or  redressable by the \nnamed defendants.   \n“Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that subject-\nmatter jurisdiction exists before reaching the merits of a dispute.” Jacobson v. \nFla. Sec’y of State, 974 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir. 2020). “Absent a justiciable \n2 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 3 of 7\ncase or controversy between interested parties, [federal courts] lack the ‘power \nto declare the law.’” Wood v. Raffensperger, 981 F. 3d 1307, 1313 (11th Cir. \n2020) (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for A Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998)). \nThis is because “[t]he Constitution makes clear that federal courts are courts \nof limited jurisdiction.” Id. at 1310 (citing U.S. CONST. Art. III). Given this \nCourt’s limited jurisdiction, plaintiffs must demonstrate “(1) an injury in fact \nthat (2) is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and (3) is \nlikely to be redressed by a favorable decision.” Jacobson, 974 F.3d at 1245. And \n“[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these \nelements.” Lujan v. Defs. Of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nThe key questions for traceability and redressability “are who caused the \ninjury and how it can be remedied.” City of S. Miami v. Gov. of Fla., 65 F.4th \n631, 640 (11th Cir. 2023). Courts ask the latter question because “[f]ederal \ncourts have no authority to erase a duly enacted law from the statute books.” \nJacobson, 974 F.3d at 1255 (quoting Jonathan F. Mitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure \nFallacy, 104 VA. L. REV. 933, 936 (2018)). Instead, they possess only the more \nlimited authority to “enjoin executive officials from taking steps to enforce a \nstatute.” Id. And even then, they “exercise that power only when the officials \nwho enforce the challenged statute are made parties to the suit.” Id. (emphasis \nadded).  \n3 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 4 of 7\nAs a result, if another party—such as a district attorney or county election \nofficial—can continue to implement the challenged provisions even if this Court \nwere to enjoin the parties here, an order from this Court would hardly solve the \nproblem DOJ claims it has identified. To establish redressability, “it must be \n‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a \nfavorable decision.’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 61 (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare \nRights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976)). Here, DOJ relies entirely on speculation \nbecause it sued the wrong party. Even if an order from this Court might persuade \nthe correct non-parties to follow its injunction, that is not enough. “Redressability \nrequires that the court be able to afford relief through the exercise of its power,\nnot through the persuasive or even awe-inspiring effect of the opinion explaining\nthe exercise of its power.” Lewis v. Governor of Alabama, 944 F. 3d 1287, 1305 \n(11th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (quoting Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 825 \n(1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (emphasis \noriginal)).  \nFurther, any “injury cannot ‘result [from] the independent action of some \nthird party not before the court.’” Anderson v. Raffensperger, 497 F. Supp. 3d \n1300, 1328 (N.D. Ga. 2020) (quoting Hollywood Mobile Estates Ltd. v. Seminole \nTribe of Fla., 641 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir. 2011)). And “traceability does not \nexist where ‘an independent source would have caused [plaintiff] to suffer the \n4 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 5 of 7\nsame injury.’” Id. (quoting Swann v. Sec’y, Georgia, 668 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th \nCir. 2012)). \nB. Neither  Houston  County  itself  nor  its  Board  of \nCommissioners conduct elections in Houston County.   \nIn Georgia, county boards of election administer elections. O.C.G.A. § 21-\n2-70. Multiple courts have confirmed that boards “are charged under Georgia \nlaw with the responsibility of administering [] elections.” Georgia Shift v. \nGwinnett Cnty., No. 1:19-CV-01135-AT, 2020 WL 864938, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. \n12, 2020); see also Ga. Ass’n of Latino Elected Offs., Inc. v. Gwinnett Cnty. Bd. of \nRegistration & Elections, 36 F.4th 1100, 1108 (11th Cir. 2022); Fair Fight Action, \nInc. v. Raffensperger, No. 1:18-CV-5391-SCJ, 2021 WL 9553855, at *11 (N.D. Ga. \nFeb.  16,  2021).  This  is  true  in  Houston  County  as  well,  where  the \nadministration of elections is carried out by the Board of Elections. O.C.G.A. §§ \n21-2-2(35)(A) and 21-2-70; Houston County, Ga., Code, Ch. 2, Article III, Div. \n10, § 2-258 (creation of county board of elections). \nCounty governing authorities, on the other hand, such as the county or \nthe board of commissioners, do not administer or supervise elections.1 But DOJ \nrequests this Court enter an injunction against only the County and the Board \n1 Houston County’s method of election was set by the Georgia General \nAssembly, not by Houston County. See 1970 GA.LAWS, page 2962–63 § 2 (most \nrecent amendment regarding method of election). \n5 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 6 of 7\nof Commissioners to prevent “any future elections for the Houston County \nBoard of Commissioners under the current method of election.” [Doc. 1 at 8]. \nThat kind of an injunction would prove futile because the “officials who enforce \nthe challenged” practice are not defendants in DOJ’s Complaint.2 Jacobson, 974 \nF.3d  at  1255.  Thus,  DOJ’s  complaint  does  not  satisfy  the  redressability \nrequirement that “a court decision… either eliminate the [alleged] harm or \ncompensate for it.” Muransky v. Godiva Chocolatier, Inc., 979 F.3d 917, 924 (11th \nCir. 2020) (en banc). \nThe Attorney General’s claims in this case are not redressable by or \ntraceable to either Houston County or its Board of Commissioners. Without \nthese key elements of standing, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and \nthe Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  For these \nreasons, the Complaint should be dismissed. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to consider DOJ’s Complaint \nbecause it does not sue the correct parties. This Court should dismiss the \nComplaint.  \n2 The Attorney General’s authority to bring actions to enforce Section 2 \nalso specifically mentions local election officials. See 52 U.S.C. § 10308(d). \n6 \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 19-1     Filed 03/17/25     Page 7 of 7\nRespectfully submitted this 17th day of March, 2025. \n/s/ Bryan P. Tyson \nBryan P.

Doc. 1.  The DOJ \nalleged that the at-large method of electing members of the Houston County, Georgia, \nBoard of Commissioners dilutes Black voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the \nVRA.  Id. ¶¶ 1-3, 11-34.  Houston County residents Courtney Driver and Michael Jones \nsuccessfully moved to intervene to supplement the DOJ’s allegations.  Docs. 7; 13.  \nTheir complaint in intervention added the Houston County Board of Elections (“BOE”) \nand its chair, Pamela Morgan, in her official capacity, as defendants.  Doc. 14.  In March \n2025, the DOJ changed its mind and dismissed its claims against Houston County and \nthe commissioners.  Doc. 20.  The Court realigned Driver and Jones as plaintiffs and \ndismissed Houston County and the commissioners on the plaintiffs’ unopposed motion.  \nDocs. 22; 23; 25.  The BOE and Morgan (“defendants”) now move to dismiss the \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 2 of 12\ncomplaint (Doc. 14) in its entirety under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and \n(6).  Doc. 29.  For the reasons that follow, the defendants’ motion (Doc. 29) is DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND \n  Plaintiffs Driver and Jones are Black residents and registered voters in Houston \nCounty, Georgia.  Doc. 14 ¶¶ 5, 6.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief \nrequiring the defendants to administer future elections for members of the Houston \nCounty Board of Commissioners using a method of election that complies with Section \n2.  Id. at 9. \nII. STANDARD \nA. Standard Under 12(b)(1) \n“A defendant can move to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction by either facial or factual attack.”  Stalley v. Orlando Reg’l \nHeathcare Sys., Inc., 524 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir. 2008).  “A facial attack on the \ncomplaint requires the court merely to look and see if the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged \na basis of subject matter jurisdiction, and the allegations in his complaint are taken as \ntrue for the purposes of the motion.”  Id. at 1232-33 (quoting McElmurray v. Consol. \nGov’t of Augusta-Richmond Cnty., 501 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir. 2007)).  A factual \nattack, however, “challenges the existence of subject matter jurisdiction using material \nextrinsic from the pleadings, such as affidavits or testimony.”  Id. at 1233.  The attack \nhere is facial.  Doc. 29-1 at 14.  \nB. Standard Under 12(b)(6) \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a pleading contain “a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. \n-2- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 3 of 12\nP. 8(a)(2).  To avoid dismissal pursuant to Rule12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter … to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. 2mbly, 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is facially plausible when “the court [can] draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  \n“Factual allegations that are ‘merely consistent with a defendant’s liability’ fall short of \nbeing facially plausible.”  Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. \n2012) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). \nAt the motion to dismiss stage, “all well-pleaded facts are accepted as true, and \nthe reasonable inferences therefrom are construed in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.”  FindWhat Inv. Grp. v. FindWhat.com., 658 F.3d 1282, 1296 (11th Cir. 2011) \n(quoting Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., 466 F.3d 1255, 1261 (11th Cir. 2006)).  But \n“conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions \nmasquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.”  Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, \n297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).  The complaint must “give the defendant fair \nnotice of what the … claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  2mbly, 550 U.S. at \n555.  Where there are dispositive issues of law, a court may dismiss a claim regardless \nof the alleged facts.  Patel v. Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, 904 F.3d 1314, 1321 \n(11th Cir. 2018). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Plaintiffs Have an Implied Right of Action Under Section 2 \n  The defendants argue that Section 2 of the VRA does not create a private right of \naction or a private remedy.  Docs. 29-1 at 4; 36 at 6–9.  Specifically, the defendants \n-3- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 4 of 12\nmaintain that “the statute is devoid of any textual hook creating a private right of action \nto enforce § 2.”  See Doc. 29-1 at 5–6 (arguing that Section 2 is only enforceable by the \nAttorney General) (citing 52 U.S.C. § 10308), 7 (asserting that Section 3 “is not rights \ncreating language … [r]ather, it simply acknowledges a cause of action where a private \nright already exists”).  The defendants argue that in the absence of a textual basis for a \nprivate right of action, federal courts cannot imply one.  Id. at 8–12 (“[F]ederal courts \nlack the authority to imply [a private right of action] when the remedial scheme has \nalready been clearly set forth by Congress.”).    \n1.  Section 2 confers a private right \nIn Singleton v. Allen, 2025 WL 1342947, at *171–181 (N.D. Ala. May 8, 2025) \nand Singleton v. Allen, 740 F. Supp. 3d 1138, 1156–70 (N.D. Ala. 2024), a three-judge \ndistrict court held that Section 2 confers a private right.  Because Singleton conducted a \ncomprehensive examination of Section 2 using the Supreme Court’s analysis in Health \n& Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 183-86 (2023) as a guide, and \nthis Court cannot say it better, the Court adopts Singleton’s thoroughly reasoned \nanalysis and conclusions.  \nThe Court adds that Supreme Court’s recent decision in Medina v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 606 U.S. __, 145 S. Ct. 2219, 222 L. Ed. 2d 567 (June 26, 2025) \nreinforces Singleton’s approach.  Considering a Medicaid provision enacted pursuant to \nCongress’s spending power, Medina reaffirmed the private right analysis set forth in \nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283, 285–86 (2002) and Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183-86.  Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2233–34.  Thus, to establish that a statute secures an \nenforceable right, a plaintiff must show that the law in question “display[s] an \n-4- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 5 of 12\n‘unmistakable focus’ on individuals like the plaintiff” and “‘clear[ly] and unambiguous[ly]’ \nuses ‘rights creating terms.’”  Id. at 2229 (citing Gonzaga, 536 U. S. at 283; Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183).  Singleton meticulously followed Gonzaga and Talevski to determine \nthat Section 2 confers a privately enforceable right.  2025 WL 1342947, at *171–77; 740 \nF. Supp. 3d at 1157–63.  Thus, Singleton’s analysis and conclusions apply with even \ngreater force after Medina.  \nMedina also reaffirmed that “a title may underscore that the statutory text creates \na right” but it “‘cannot enlarge or confer powers’ by itself.”  145 S. Ct. at 2237 (quoting \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 19 n.14 (1981)).  Singleton \nobserved “[t]he title of Section 2 is ‘[d]enial or abridgement of right to vote on account of \nrace or color through voting qualifications or prerequisites; establishment of violation,’” \nand “assign[ed] weight to this observation” in accordance with “(1) the rule that statutory \nprovisions must be read in their context, and (2) the recognition in Gonzaga that [t]his \nframing is indicative of an individual rights-creating focus.”  2025 WL 1342947, at *172–\n73; 740 F. Supp. 3d at 1157–58 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 171) (internal citations \nand quotations omitted) (alterations in original).  Thus, Singleton’s consideration of \nSection 2’s title for context and framing was entirely consistent with Medina.  \nIn short, Section 2 of the VRA creates a privately enforceable right.  \n2.  The VRA creates a private remedy \n  To find an implied private right of action, the Court must determine whether \nSection 2 “displays an intent to create not just a private right, but also a private remedy.” \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286–87 (2001).  The plaintiffs maintain that \nSections 3 and 14 of the VRA demonstrate Congress’s intent to create a private remedy \n-5- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 6 of 12\nthat can be applied to Section 2.   Doc. 35 at 17-18; see 52 U.S.C. §§ 10302, 10310.  \nThe Court agrees.  \nThe plaintiffs’ argument, framed within applicable precedent, may be summarized \nas follows: Section 3 authorizes remedial oversight measures when proceedings are \nbrought by “the Attorney General or an aggrieved person” to “enforce the voting \nguarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment.”  52 U.S.C. §§ 10302(a)–(c) \n(emphasis added).  Section 14 allows for attorney fees to a “prevailing party, other than \nthe United States” in “any action or proceeding to enforce the voting guarantees of the \nfourteenth or fifteenth amendment.”  52 U.S.C. § 10310(e).  Courts in the Eleventh \nCircuit have concluded that the VRA, including Section 2, “is a constitutional exercise of \ncongressional enforcement power under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.”  \nUnited States v. Marengo Cnty. Comm'n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1550 (11th Cir. 1984); Georgia \nState Conf. of the NAACP v. Georgia, 2022 WL 18780945 at *6 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 26, \n2022) (“Section 2 is inevitably—at least in part—an action that ‘enforce[s] the voting \nguarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment’ as contemplated in Sections 3 and \n14 of the VRA”); Singleton, 740 F. Supp. 3d at 1159–60 (“Section 2 is unambiguously \nan action or proceeding to ‘enforce the voting guarantees of the … fifteenth \namendment.’”) (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 10310(e)).  Putting everything together, “[b]ecause \na Section 2 action enforces the voting guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \nAmendments, a Section 2 action is among the proceedings that Congress has implied, \nin Sections 3 and 14 of the VRA, that private parties may assert.”  Georgia State Conf. \nof the NAACP, 2022 WL 18780945, at *5–6; see Morse v. Republican Party, 517 U.S. \n186, 233–34 (1996) (explaining that when “Congress amended [Section 3] to cover \n-6- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 7 of 12\nactions brought by ‘the Attorney General or an aggrieved person,’ … [it] must have \nintended to provide private remedies [in § 10]” and “[t]he same logic applies to § 14(e)”).   \n  The defendants challenge this analysis on two grounds.  First, the defendants, \nciting Ark. State Conf. NAACP v. Ark. Bd. of Apportionment, 86 F.4th 1204, 1211 (8th \nCir. 2023), contend that Section 3 does not create a private remedy because its \n“aggrieved person” language “was added to assist in the private prosecution of ‘a \nproceeding under any statute’ instituted to enforce the voting guarantees of the \nfourteenth amendment that already contained a private right of action.”  Docs. 36 at 8 \n(quoting 52 U.S.C. §§ 10302(a), (b)); 29-1 at 7–8; see Ark. State Conf. NAACP, 86 \nF.4th at 1211 (“The next phrase after ‘aggrieved person’ mentions ‘a proceeding under \nany statute,’ which most reasonably refers to statutes that already allow for private \nlawsuits.”).  But the defendants make no effort to reconcile this contention with Section \n3’s plain language, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments’ voting-related \nprotections, and Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent which, as discussed \nabove, embrace Section 2 as a “statute to enforce the voting guarantees of the \nfourteenth or fifteenth amendment.”  52 U.S.C. §§ 10302(a)–(c).  And despite \ndefendants’ urging, the Court is neither bound by the outlying (for now), divided panel \nEighth Circuit decision in Ark. State Conf. NAACP nor persuaded by its reasoning.  See \nArk. State Conf. NAACP, 86 F.4th at 1224 (Smith, J. dissenting) (“It would be ambitious \nindeed for a [lower] court ... to deny a private right of action in the light of precedent and \nhistory.”) (alterations in original) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  \n  Second, the defendants argue that Section 14 does not “necessarily refer[]” to \nprivate litigants, as the plaintiffs argue.  Doc. 36 at 9.  Rather, defendants maintain that \n-7- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 8 of 12\nby allowing a “prevailing party” to recover attorney fees, Section 14 “ensure[s] state and \nlocal jurisdictions are adequately compensated for the expenses of litigation wrongly \ninstituted by the United States.”  Id.  But plaintiffs merely note, based on substantial \nprecedent, that Section 14’s authorization of attorney fees to “prevailing part[ies]” who \nare not the Government “‘reinforces the idea that Congress contemplated suits by \nprivate parties when it enacted Section Two.’”  Doc. 35 at 18 (citing Singleton, 2025 WL \n1342947, at *174; Morse, 517 U.S. at 234).  In short, defendants’ argument that Section \n14 contemplates parties besides private litigants fails to move the needle.   \nFor the reasons stated, the Court is satisfied that the text and structure of the \nVRA evidence Congress’s intent to create a private remedy for Section 2.   \nB. Plaintiffs are Entitled to Sue Under Section 1983 \n  Next, the defendants argue that Section 2 cannot be individually enforced under \nSection 1983.  Doc. 29-1 at 12.  “Plaintiffs suing under § 1983 do not have the burden of \nshowing an intent to create a private remedy because § 1983 generally supplies a \nremedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284–85.  Because this Court finds that Section 2 confers an individual right, “the right is \npresumptively enforceable by § 1983.”  Id. \nTo overcome this presumption, the defendants must demonstrate that Congress \ndid not intend that Section 1983 be available to enforce Section 2, either because the \nstatute “expressly forbid § 1983’s use” or because Congress precluded its use \n“implicitly, by creating ‘a “comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with \nindividual enforcement under § 1983.’”  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186 (quoting City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005)).  The defendants argue \n-8- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 9 of 12\nthat Congress impliedly foreclosed individual enforcement of Section 2 under Section \n1983 because “[Section 12 of] [t]he VRA contains … a comprehensive enforcement \nprocess through the Attorney General” which is “incompatible” with individual \nenforcement under Section 1983.  Docs. 29-1 at 13; 38 at 2 (citing 52 U.S.C. §§ 10302, \n10308, 10310; Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2229).    \nIn Talevski, the Supreme Court examined its precedent finding implicit preclusion \nand determined that each case “concerned statutes with self-contained enforcement \nschemes that included statute-specific rights of action.”  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189 (citing \nRancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 120–23; Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 100–13 \n(1984); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 \nU.S. 1, 6–7, 19–21 (1981)).  Further, “[e]ach such statute required plaintiffs to ‘comply \nwith particular procedures and/or to exhaust particular administrative remedies’ under \nthe statute’s enforcement scheme before suing under its dedicated right of action.”  Id. \n(quoting Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 (2009)).  Talevski \nconcluded that such comprehensive enforcement schemes were incompatible with \nindividual enforcement under Section 1983 because “in all three cases, § 1983’s \noperation would have thwarted Congress’s scheme coming and going: It would have \n‘circumvented’ the statutes’ presuit procedures, and would have also ‘given plaintiffs \naccess to tangible benefits’ as remedies that were ‘unavailable under the statutes.’”  Id. \n(quoting Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 124).  \nThe defendants here “ha[ve] identified no equivalent sign [of incompatibility] in \nthe” VRA.  Id. at 190.  Unlike the statutes identified in Talevski, the VRA does not \n“provide[] an express private right of action with procedural and substantive \n-9- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 10 of 12\nrequirements” or a private administrative remedy.  Doc. 35 at 26-27.  And Section 12, \nwhile it confers enforcement authority to the Attorney General, lacks any indicia of \ncongressional intent to preclude individual enforcement under Section 1983.  The \ndefendants argue that Congress must have intended the Attorney General to exercise \nsole enforcement authority because the “VRA alters the careful balancing of state and \nfederal power in the context of elections” (Doc. 36 at 11), but the defendants fail to offer \nany suggestion of incompatibility in Section 12 or elsewhere in the statute.  “The \nattendant presumption is that § 1983 can play its textually prescribed role as a vehicle \nfor enforcing [statutorily conferred] rights, even alongside a detailed enforcement regime \nthat also protects those interests, so long as §1983 enforcement is not ‘incompatible’ \nwith Congress’s handiwork.”  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 188–89 (emphasis added) (citing \nRancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 120; Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 347–48 \n(1997)).  Enforcement by the Attorney General is thus, presumptively, a non-exclusive \nmeans to vindicate voting rights.   \nFurther, as the plaintiffs point out, the Eleventh Circuit held in Schwier v. Cox, \n340 F.3d 1284 (11th Cir. 2003) that an Attorney General enforcement provision1 \nvirtually identical to Section 12 of the VRA2 did not preclude a Section 1983 remedy.  Id. \nat 1296 (“Neither [the statute’s] provision for enforcement by the Attorney General nor \n \n1 “Whenever any person has engaged or there are reasonable grounds to believe that any person is \nabout to engage in any act or practice which would deprive any other person of any right or privilege \nsecured by subsection (a) or (b), the Attorney General may institute for the United States, or in the name \nof the United States, a civil action or other proper proceeding for preventive relief, including an application \nfor a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order.”  52 U.S.C. § 10101(c).   \n \n2 “Whenever any person has engaged or there are reasonable grounds to believe that any person is \nabout to engage in any act or practice prohibited by [specified VRA sections], the Attorney General may \ninstitute for the United States, or in the name of the United States, an action for preventive relief, including \nan application for a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order, or other order ….”  52 U.S.C. § \n10308(d).   \n-10- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 11 of 12\nCongress’s failure to provide for a private right of action expressly in [the \nstatute] require the conclusion that Congress did not intend such a right to exist.”).  \nRather than substantively address this argument, the defendants respond that Schwier \nis “irrelevant because it relied on provisions of the Civil Rights Act separate from the \nVRA.”  Doc. 36 at 8 n. 3.  The Court is unconvinced.  Schwier’s reasoning confirms the \nAttorney General enforcement provision does not evince a “careful congressional \ntailoring that § 1983 actions would distort.”  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 190; Schwier, 340 \nF.3d 1284 at 1294–96 (citing Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 556–57 \n(1969); Morse, 517 U.S. at 193).  \nAccordingly, private plaintiffs may enforce Section 2 either through an implied \nprivate right of action, Section 1983, or both.   \nC. Plaintiffs Have Sufficiently Pleaded Their Vote Dilution Claims \n  The defendants argue that to show standing, the plaintiffs must “allege they live \nin an area of the County where a majority-Black district could be drawn or that such a \ndistrict could be drawn in their portion of the County.”  Doc. 29-1 at 13.  Defendants cite \nno authority supporting this assertion and the Court is aware of none.  See Rose v. \nRaffensperger, 511 F. Supp. 3d 1340, 1352 (N.D. Ga. 2021) (“To demonstrate an injury-\nin-fact for purposes of a vote dilution claim, Plaintiffs must show that they (1) reside and \nare registered voters in districts where alleged dilution occurred, and (2) are members \nof a protected class whose voting strength was diluted.”).  The plaintiffs have sufficiently \nestablished standing.  \n \n \n-11- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-00025-MTT     Document 41     Filed 09/02/25     Page 12 of 12\nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn sum, the defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) \n(Doc. 29) is DENIED.  \nSO ORDERED, this 2nd day of September, 2025.  \nS/ Marc T.

      "text": " \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA \nMACON DIVISION \n \n \n   \nUnited States of America,  Case No. 5:25-cv-00025-MTT \n \n \n  Plaintiff, \n \n \nComplaint-in-Intervention \n vs. \n   \nHouston County, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \nNature of the Case \n1.  This is an action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, 52 U.S.C. § 10301, challenging the method of electing members of \nthe Houston County Board of Commissioners.  \n2.  The plaintiff-intervenors are Black voters, and they seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting further use of the existing \nmethod of election on the ground that it dilutes Black voting strength in \nviolation of Section 2. \n\nJurisdiction and Venue \n3.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter \nof this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3)-(4), and 2201(a), 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, and 52 U.S.C. § 10308(f). \n4.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §§ 90(b)(2) \nand 1391(b). \nParties \n5.  Plaintiff-Intervenor Courtney Driver is a Black resident and \nregistered voter in Houston County, Georgia. \n6.  Plaintiff-Intervenor Michael C. Jones is a Black resident and \nregistered voter in Houston County, Georgia. \n7.  Defendant Houston County is a political subdivision of the \nState of Georgia. \n8.  Defendants Dan Perdue, Shane Gottwals, Gail Robinson, Tal \nTalton, and Mark Byrd are elected members of the Houston County \nBoard of Commissioners. They are sued in their official capacities. \n9.  Defendant Houston County Board of Elections is responsible \nfor conducting elections for members of the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners. \n2 \n \n\n10.  Defendant Pamela Morgan is the chair of the Houston \nCounty Board of Elections. She is sued in her official capacity. \nBackground \n11.  The Houston County Board of Commissioners has five \nmembers, elected in staggered at-large contests for four-year terms. \nEach member is elected to a numbered Post, with the commissioner \nelected from Post 1 serving as chairman. \n12.  Elections for the Houston County Board of Commissioners \nare held in November of even-numbered years and are preceded by \npartisan primaries in May. If no candidate obtains a majority in a \nprimary or the general election, the top two finishers advance to a runoff \nelection four weeks later. Voters may cast one vote for a candidate \nrunning for election to each numbered Post. \n13.  According to the 2020 Census, Houston County has a \npopulation of 163,633, including 86,211 non-Hispanic White persons \n(52.7%) and 54,148 non-Hispanic Black persons (33.1%). Houston \nCounty also has a voting-age population of 122,118, including 68,018 \nnon-Hispanic White persons (55.7%) and 38,329 non-Hispanic Black \npersons (31.4%).  \n3 \n \n\n14.  The 2018-2022 American Community Survey estimated that \nHouston County had a citizen voting-age population of 118,735, \nincluding 69,195 non-Hispanic White persons (58.3%) and 37,405 non-\nHispanic Black persons (31.5%). \n15.  There are approximately 105,000 active registered voters in \nHouston County, including approximately 58,000 White registered \nvoters (55%) and approximately 32,000 Black registered voters (30%). \n16.  White registered voters in Houston County turn out to vote \nat higher rates than Black registered voters in Houston County.  \n17.  The Black population of Houston County is sufficiently \nnumerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority of the \nvoting-age population and the citizen voting-age population in a single-\nmember district for the Houston County Board of Commissioners under \na five-district plan. \n18.  The Black population of Houston County is also sufficiently \nnumerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority of the \nvoting-age population and citizen voting-age population in a single-\nmember district for the Houston County Board of Commissioners under \na four-district plan. \n4 \n \n\n19.  There are also numerous remedies that could be adopted \nwithin the confines of a countywide system of elections for four or five \nmembers of the Houston County Board of Commissioners. These \nremedies include, but are not limited to, cumulative voting, limited \nvoting, and ranked-choice or single transferable voting. Black voters in \nHouston County would have a meaningful opportunity to elect at least \none member of the Board of Commissioners under each of these \ncountywide remedies. \n20.  Since Reconstruction, only one Black candidate, Houston \nPorter, has been elected to the Houston County Board of Commissioners.  \n21.  After an unsuccessful campaign in 1978, Porter was elected \nto the Houston County Board of Commissioners in 1980. Porter defeated \nan incumbent in a primary runoff election by only 49 votes and was \nuncontested in the general election. Porter was reelected in 1984 and \n1988 and declined to seek reelection in 1992.  \n22.  Black candidates ran for the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners in 1992, 1994, 2002, 2016, 2020, and 2022. During this \nperiod, Black candidates have run as Democrats, as a Republican, and \n5 \n \n\nas an independent. All were defeated in partisan primaries or general \nelections.  \n23.  In elections for the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners, the Black population of Houston County is politically \ncohesive, and the White population votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually \ndefeat the preferred candidate of Black voters.  \n24.  Black voters consistently vote for Black candidates for the \nHouston County Board of Commissioners.   \n25.  Since 2002, at least 85% of Black voters have supported \nBlack candidates in general elections for the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners.   \n26.  Although relatively few Black voters have participated in \nRepublican primaries, most of the Black voters who did participate in \nthe 2022 Republican primary supported a Black Republican candidate \nfor the Houston County Board of Commissioners. \n27.  In contests between Black candidates and White candidates \nfor the Houston County Board of Commissioners, White voters cast their \nballots sufficiently as a bloc to defeat Black voters’ preferred candidate.  \n6 \n \n\n28.  Since 2002, fewer than one-fourth of White voters supported \nBlack-preferred Black candidates in general elections for the Board of \nCommissioners. Since 2016, fewer than one in ten White voters have \nsupported Black-preferred Black candidates in general elections for the \nBoard of Commissioners. As a result, each Black-preferred Black \ncandidate was defeated.  \n29.  Even when a Black candidate has run as a Republican and \nreceived majority support from participating Black voters in the primary \nelection, less than one-fourth of White voters supported that candidate \nin that primary. As a result, this Black-preferred Black candidate was \ndefeated.  \n30.  Houston County and the State of Georgia have a long and \nextensive history of voting discrimination against Black voters. \n31.  Voting in elections for members of the Houston County \nBoard of Commissioners is polarized along racial lines. \n32.  Elections for members of the Houston County Board of \nCommissioners feature voting practices that enhance the opportunity for \ndiscrimination against Black voters, including staggered terms, \nnumbered posts, and a majority-vote requirement. \n7 \n \n\n33.  Black residents of Houston County bear the effects of \ndiscrimination in such areas as housing, employment, and health, which \nhinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process. \n34.  The existing at-large method of electing members of the \nHouston County Board of Commissioners lacks proportionality in that \nthe percentage of districts in which Black voters constitute an effective \nmajority is less than the Black percentage of Houston County’s voting-\nage population. \nRelief \n \n35.  A real and actual controversy exists between the parties. \n36.  The plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than \nthis action for declaratory and equitable relief. \n37.  The plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm as a result of \nthe violation complained of herein, and that harm will continue unless \ndeclared unlawful and enjoined by this Court. \n \n   \n8 \n \n\nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff-intervenors respectfully pray that this \nCourt: \n(1) enter a declaratory judgment that the current method of \nelecting members of the Houston County Board of Commissioners \ndilutes black voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301; \n(2) enjoin the defendants from administering any future elections \nfor members of the Houston County Board of Commissioners \nusing the current method of election; \n(3) order the defendants to administer future elections for \nmembers of the Houston County Board of Commissioners using a \nmethod of election that complies with Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act; \n(4) award the plaintiff-intervenors the costs of this action together \nwith their reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses under 52 \nU.S.C. § 10310(e) and 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and  \n(5) retain jurisdiction of this action and grant the plaintiff-\nintervenors any further relief which may in the discretion of the \nCourt be necessary and proper. \n9 \n \n\n \nRespectfully submitted this 5th day of March, 2025. \n \n/s/  Bryan L.
