    "summary": "<p>This case challenged President Trump's executive order targeting a powerhouse law firm for its historic association with progressive causes and clients.</p>\r\n<p>On March 11, 2025, Perkins Coie LLP, an international law firm based out of Seattle, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiff named the United States of America, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission, the Office of Management and Budget, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and their corresponding agency heads as defendants.</p>\r\n<p>Attorneys at Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, defended Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election against several legal challenges, and litigated numerous voting rights cases. In this lawsuit, Perkins Coie challenged EO 14230, \"Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,\" issued on March 6, 2025. The EO accused the law firm of being \"dishonest and dangerous\" in its legal representation and of engaging in unlawful discrimination through its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, and it sought to immediately suspend all security clearances, government benefits and services, and contracts previously granted by the federal government to Perkins Coie LLP or its employees. Plaintiff Perkins Cole alleged that the EO constituted the unauthorized exercise of judicial power by the executive branch and violated the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On Count I, plaintiff alleged that sanctioning a private law firm through the EO constituted an ultra vires Presidential action, as there was no authority in the Constitution for the President to take such action. On Counts II and III, plaintiff alleged that the EO constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of procedural due process. Plaintiff alleged that the EO was given without any notice and was unconstitutionally vague, as it provided no basis to understand what conduct was prohibited, nor any guidance on which interactions and buildings were banned from plaintiff's employees, nor what constituted a \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" policy. On Count IV, plaintiff alleged that the EO was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection because its purpose was to discriminate against plaintiff specifically. On Count V, plaintiff alleged that the EO amounted to political viewpoint discrimination in violation of First Amendment free speech and associational rights. On Count VI, plaintiff alleged that the EO's requirement that government contractors to disclose any business they do with plaintiff amounted to compelled disclosure under in violation of First Amendment free speech and associational rights. On Count VII, plaintiff alleged that the EO was retaliation for plaintiff's statements in favor of diversity and inclusion in violation of First Amendment free speech and associational rights. On Count VIII, plaintiff alleged that the EO violated plaintiff's clients&rsquo; Sixth Amendment rights to counsel because it directed agency heads to limit government employees from engaging with the Plaintiff's employees and thus impaired plaintiff&rsquo;s ability to advance clients&rsquo; interests before the government. Finally, on Count IX, plaintiff alleged that defendants violated the Fifth Amendment right to counsel because the EO interfered with and chilled client-lawyer relationships.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the private law firm Williams &amp; Connolly, plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the implementation of the Order. Plaintiff filed a motion for temporary restraining order the same day.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Beryl Howell; after a hearing on March 12, the court granted plaintiff's requested temporary restraining order, enjoining the government from implementing the parts of the EO relating to federal contracting, hiring, and access to government buildings. The TRO was extended into a preliminary injunction on March 14.</p>\r\n<p>On March 21, 2025, Defendants filed a motion to disqualify Judge Howell. Defendants argued that Judge Howell was \"insufficiently impartial\" due to her involvement in the Mueller Report and the investigation of Special Counsel John Durham, two cases where she issued orders against President Trump. Defendants argued that Judge Howell's previous record constituted a \"pattern of hostility\" against defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finding that defendants' motion relied only on &ldquo;speculation[ and] innuendo&rdquo; in seeking to get another Judge assigned to the case, Judge Howell denied the motion to disqualify on March 26.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 2, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment and permanent injunction. Plaintiff requested that the court declare that Executive Order 14230 was unlawful and that the court permanently enjoin defendants from implementing or enforcing the EO in any way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The same day, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Defendants asserted that the President possessed broad authority to regulate executive functions and that the courts should not interfere with these. Defendants further argued that Plaintiff lacked standing to sue, asserting that the firm had not demonstrated a concrete injury directly attributable to the executive order. Finally, defendants contended that the claims presented by plaintiff were not justiciable, as they involved political questions beyond the purview of judicial review. Defendants also filed a motion for reconsideration regarding the March 12 temporary restraining order.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many amicus briefs were filed in support of plaintiff by public interest groups, former members of government, private citizens, law firms, and nonprofits. Amici also included the former Presidents of the District of Columbia Bar; 363 legal professors at various U.S. law schools; and a collection of nonprofits including the ACLU, Cato Institute, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Institute for Justice.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/23/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6808ef108f0835690d817c24#block-6808ef108f0835690d817c24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President Trump posted on Truth Social</a> about the case, saying he was \"suing the law firm of Perkins Coie for their egregious and unlawful acts.\" Trump also took aim at Judge Howell, calling her a \"highly biased and unfair disaster\" and an \"unmitigated train wreck\" and expressed confidence that he had a \"100% perfect case.\"</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and granted summary judgment for Perkins Coie, holding that EO 14230 violated the firm's clients' Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, unfairly infringed on the firm's First Amendment right to petition the government, and was impermissibly vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process clause because it &ldquo;fail[ed] to provide adequate notice as to what are prohibited &lsquo;diversity, equity, and inclusion&rsquo; policies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting the government from implementing or enforcing Executive Order 14230, and requiring them to undo all implementation that had already occurred. It retained jurisidiction over the matter to enforce that injunction.</p>\r\n<p>Following defendants' motion to clarify the court's order, on May 20, 2025, the court confirmed that its permanent injunction only applied to plaintiff Perkins Coie and did not enjoin defendants with respect to other law firms or the legal profession generally.</p>\r\n<p>On June 30, 2025, defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. This case remains ongoing.</p>",

Bondi, Brendan Carr, Russell T. \nVought, Andrea R. Lucas, Charles Ezell, Stephen Ehekian, and Tulsi Gabbard, and states as \nfollows: \n   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 2 of 43\n \nWHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT \n1.  This  case  concerns  an  Executive  Order  issued  on  March  6,  2025,  entitled, \n“Addressing Risks From Perkins Coie LLP” (“the Order”).  The Order is an affront to the \nConstitution and our adversarial system of justice.  Its plain purpose is to bully those who advocate \npoints of view that the President perceives as adverse to the views of his Administration, whether \nthose views are presented on behalf of paying or pro bono clients.  Perkins Coie brings this case \nreluctantly.    The  firm  is  comprised  of lawyers  who  advocate  for  clients;  its  attorneys  and \nemployees are not activists or partisans.  But Perkins Coie’s ability to represent the interests of its \nclients—and its ability to operate as a legal-services business at all—are under direct and imminent \nthreat.  Perkins Coie cannot allow its clients to be bullied.  The firm is committed to a resolute \ndefense of the rule of law, without regard to party or ideology, and therefore brings this lawsuit to \ndeclare the Order unlawful and to enjoin its implementation. \n2.  The Order’s peculiar title betrays its oddity as an Executive Order, for its purpose \nis not executive in nature.  Rather, the Order reflects a purpose that is judicial—to adjudicate \nwhether a handful of lawyers at Perkins Coie LLP (“Perkins Coie,” “the law firm,” or “the firm”) \nengaged in misconduct in the course of litigation and then to punish them by:  (1) terminating \ngovernment contracts with firm clients, thereby driving away current and prospective clients; (2) \ndenying all members and employees of the firm access to federal buildings and meetings or other \nengagement with federal employees; and (3) immediately suspending, and possibly revoking, \nsecurity clearances for all firm employees. \n3.  The Order imposes these punishments on the entire law firm even though the \nattorneys involved in the purported misconduct numbered a mere handful of the more than 1,200 \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 3 of 43\n \nattorneys in the firm, and even though the two attorneys the Order appears to target have not been \nwith the firm for years.  \n4.  The Order imposes these punishments ex post facto—the President having already \nsupposedly adjudicated the matters—determining that Perkins Coie engaged in “dishonest and \ndangerous activity,” “manufactured” evidence in connection with the Clinton 2016 presidential \ncampaign, engaged in “a pattern” of “egregious activity” by challenging (and defending) election \nlaws, and “racially discriminated against” its employees and applicants, all without giving notice \nto Perkins Coie and without giving Perkins Coie an opportunity to be heard and contest these and \nother false and disparaging claims made in the Order. \n5.  The Order imposes these punishments as retaliation for the firm’s association with, \nand representation of, clients that the President perceives as his political opponents.  Many law \nfirms represented candidates, parties, and related political committees and organizations in the \n2016 and 2020 campaigns.  But the Order targets only one firm—Perkins Coie—because the \nPresident views it, more than any other firm, as aligned with the Democratic Party by reason of its \nrepresentation of the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign and its successful handling of challenges \nbrought by the Trump campaign seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as \nvictories the firm won for its clients in a significant number of voting rights cases, including cases \nwhere Perkins Coie succeeded in upholding existing laws, in connection with the 2020 election. \n6.  During the campaign, the President promised to retaliate against his political \nopponents, including the attorneys who represented them (“WHEN I WIN, those people that \nCHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law…. Please beware that this legal \nexposure extends to Lawyers….”).  And, in signing the Order, he insisted that Perkins Coie \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 4 of 43\n \nengaged in weaponization “against a political opponent” (i.e., himself) and justified the Order for \nthe chilling effect it would have (“it should never be allowed to happen again”). \n7.  The retaliatory aim of the Order is intentionally obvious to the general public and \nthe press because the very goal is to chill future lawyers from representing particular clients.  The \nAssociated Press wrote that “the actions appear designed not only to settle scores from years past \nbut also to deter both government officials and private sector workers from participating in new \ninquiries into his conduct.”  And that aim is also obvious to the profession, many of whom will \nonly comment anonymously, as Law.com reported (“most law firm leaders are choosing to stay \nanonymous when speaking about the administration’s orders”). \n8.  The principal claims made by the Order have already been raised in the proper \nforum and resolved by the branch of government with constitutional authority to do so.  Regarding \nthe claim that the firm engaged in misconduct in connection with its representation of the Clinton \ncampaign, the President filed a federal court lawsuit in March 2022 against Perkins Coie, Hillary \nClinton, and others.  That lawsuit asserted RICO claims concerning the campaign and allegedly \nfalsified documents.  The district court dismissed that lawsuit in September 2022.  Regarding the \nassertion that the firm “pushed” false claims about ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump \ncampaign, a Special Counsel appointed during the first Trump Administration indicted Michael \nSussmann, a former partner of the firm, in connection with evidence he brought to the attention of \nthe FBI, allegedly without disclosing his ties to the Clinton campaign.  That case went to trial in \nthis Court in May 2022, and the jury quickly and unanimously acquitted him.  Regardless, Mr. \nSussmann is now at a different firm.  And regarding the claim that former members of the firm \nwere not candid with the court, the court concerned—the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit—\nsanctioned three lawyers in 2021 by requiring them to pay $8,700 in legal fees in connection with \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 5 of 43\n \none duplicative motion to supplement the record on appeal.  None of those lawyers work for \nPerkins Coie today. \n9.  The  Order  also  seeks  to  impermissibly  punish  Perkins  Coie  because  of  its \ndisfavored  support  of  “diversity,  equity  and  inclusion.”    Perkins  Coie  has  a  longstanding \ncommitment to diversity and inclusion.  Perkins Coie, however, does not discriminate against its \nattorneys or employees on the basis of race or otherwise.  Rather, fostering an environment where \nattorneys from diverse backgrounds and experiences can thrive and make meaningful contributions \nenables Perkins Coie to attract top talent and deliver exceptional legal counsel to its clients.  \nPerkins Coie does not have, and has never had, percentage quotas for hiring or promoting \nminorities.  The lawsuit referenced in the Order challenging the firm’s diversity fellowship was \nquickly dismissed by the plaintiff after clarification that the program is open to all, regardless of \nrace.  Perkins Coie’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is not unlawful and the Order’s \nallegations are a thinly veiled pretext for further punishing the firm for a disfavored viewpoint.   \n10.  Because the Order in effect adjudicates and punishes alleged misconduct by Perkins \nCoie, it is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.  Because it does so without \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard, and because it punishes the entire firm for the purported \nmisconduct of a handful of lawyers who are not employees of the firm, it is an unconstitutional \nviolation of procedural due process and of the substantive due process right to practice one’s \nprofessional livelihood.  Because the Order singles out Perkins Coie, it denies the firm the equal \nprotection of the laws guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Because the \nOrder punishes the firm for the clients with which it has been associated and the legal positions it \nhas taken on matters of election law, the Order constitutes retaliatory viewpoint discrimination \nand, therefore, violates the First Amendment rights of free expression and association, and the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 6 of 43\n \nright to petition the government for redress.  Because the Order compels disclosure of confidential \ninformation revealing the firm’s relationships with its clients, it violates the First Amendment.  \nBecause the Order retaliates against Perkins Coie for its diversity-related speech, it violates the \nFirst Amendment.  Because the Order is vague in proscribing what is prohibited “diversity, equity \nand inclusion,” it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Because the Order \nworks to brand Perkins Coie as persona non grata and bar it from federal buildings, deny it the \nability to communicate with federal employees, and terminate the government contracts of its \nclients, the Order violates the right to counsel afforded by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.    \nJURISICTION AND VENUE \n11.  The  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction because the claims arise under the \nConstitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and because the individual \nDefendants are United States officials.  28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). \n12.  The Court has authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide temporary, \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, the All Writs Act, and the Court’s inherent equitable \npowers. \n13.  Venue lies in this District because Plaintiff has offices here and each Defendant is \nan agency or officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity.  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(e)(1). \nTHE PARTIES \nPlaintiff \n14.  Perkins Coie was founded in Seattle by a retiring U.S. District Judge and U.S. \nAttorney.  Since 1912, Perkins Coie has grown to become the largest law firm in the Pacific \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 7 of 43\n \nNorthwest and has opened offices in Asia and in Europe.  Perkins Coie has approximately 2,500 \nemployees.  Of those, nearly half are attorneys and half are business professionals.  Its employees \nare deeply woven into the fabric of their communities.  They are Sunday school teachers, Scout \nleaders, youth sports coaches, and volunteers serving on hundreds of boards of organizations \nranging from art museums and food kitchens to major universities, local schools, and foundations.  \nAnd they include former members of the armed forces, and current reservists in the U.S. military. \n15.  The firm represents a wide range of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses, individuals, and charitable and public service-oriented \norganizations.  Over its 113-year history, the lawyers of Perkins Coie have represented clients in \nevery state, in federal and state courts across the nation, and in tribunals throughout the world \n(including the Supreme Court of the United States).  Perkins Coie alumni have been and are \npresently serving as state and federal court judges, law clerks, and high-ranking government \nofficials, as well as founders, CEOs, and General Counsels of some of the nation’s largest and \nmost important companies.   \n16.  Perkins Coie has been named as an “Am Law 50” firm on The American Lawyer \n100 list for over a decade.  It has been named to Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list \nfor over 20 consecutive years, and its individual offices are often named to similar local lists.  The \nfirm and its lawyers are also regularly recognized for excellence in the legal community by Best \nLawyers®, Chambers USA, and other respected organizations, including national and local bar \nassociations.  And Perkins Coie is often recognized for fostering a work environment in which all \nlawyers and business professionals are judged on their merit and can reach their potential.   \n17.  Perkins Coie attorneys are drawn from all sides of the political spectrum, with most \nnot politically active.  There are attorneys who are liberal and attorneys who are conservative.  At \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 8 of 43\n \nthe time Bob Bauer started the firm’s small Political Law practice it was known in Seattle as, if \nanything, a “Republican firm.”  Things have become more balanced, and many of the firm’s \nattorneys  joined  the  firm  after  government  service  under  both  Democratic  and  Republican \nadministrations, or after serving as judges or law clerks to judges appointed by both Democratic \nand Republican presidents.  Reflecting this bipartisan ethos, in recent years, four Perkins Coie \npartners have been nominated and confirmed to serve as federal judges—two by President Trump \nin 2019, and two by President Biden in 2021 and 2023.   \n18.  Perkins Coie is dedicated to serving its clients, its communities, and each other.  It \nhas a longstanding, firmwide commitment to pro bono service.  In 2024, for example, Perkins Coie \nlawyers and business professionals spent over 89,000 hours valued at nearly $70 million in pro \nbono service.  Over the past 35 years, the firm has provided approximately 1.45 million hours of \npro bono service to innumerable clients, including veterans, indigent families, disabled persons, \nand community-based organizations of all sizes, including the League of Women Voters and other \nnon-partisan organizations, in matters championing human, civil, and electoral rights, housing, \neducation, food, benefits, and economic justice.  Its pro bono service also extends to representing \nindigent criminal defendants before federal courts by court appointment.  Much of its pro bono \nwork involves advocating for military and veterans’ rights.  The firm has dozens of active veterans-\nbenefits matters on behalf of those who have served this country.   \n19.  As a full-service law firm that represents clients in all sectors of the economy in \ntransactional, litigation, and regulatory matters, Perkins Coie lawyers necessarily interact with the \nfederal government and its employees on behalf of their clients in innumerable ways.  Those \ninteractions are critical to their ability to practice their profession.  The firm’s lawyers routinely \nappear in federal court on behalf of their clients in civil and criminal cases, as well as in \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 9 of 43\n \nadministrative proceedings before federal agencies.  They also communicate on behalf of their \nclients with federal government officials in court proceedings alongside, adverse, or incidental to \nthe federal government in government-owned and -controlled buildings, and as part of daily \ninformal communications through in-person meetings, telephone calls, videoconferences, letters, \nand the like. \n20.  Every single one of the firm’s nine main client-facing practice groups intersects \nwith the federal government and each includes clients with business before the federal government.  \nThe largest practice groups by headcount are Commercial Litigation, Business, and Intellectual \nProperty, which together account for approximately 75% of the firm’s attorneys.  The vast majority \nof the work in those groups is performed on behalf of clients who have had, or are competing for, \nbusiness with the government.  The smallest practice group by headcount is Political Law, which \nincludes 8 attorneys (and 19 others affiliated with that practice).  The firm’s Political Law practice \nhas historically been much smaller than the firm’s other practice groups, and it also substantially \nshrank in 2021 when Marc Elias and about 50 other attorneys left Perkins Coie to form the Elias \nLaw Group.  It currently accounts for about 0.5% of the firm’s revenue.  This practice group \nhistorically has handled a mix of paying and pro bono cases. \n21.  The firm’s nearly 1,000 active matters for its clients require Perkins Coie lawyers \nto interact with more than 90 different federal agencies.  For example, the firm’s Intellectual \nProperty group—among the largest practices at the firm—depends heavily on access to and \ninteraction with the federal government.  The hundreds of attorneys in this group frequently \nrepresent patent applicants, patent owners, and patent challengers before the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark  Office  (USPTO)  in  patent  prosecution  and  post-grant  proceedings,  including  in \nadministrative trials before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).  Perkins Coie lawyers are \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 10 of 43\n \ncurrently representing over five hundred clients in over 5,000 pending patent applications before \nthe  USPTO  and  dozens  more  in  active  post-grant  proceedings  (i.e.,  administrative  trial \nproceedings) before the PTAB before the International Trade Commission (ITC).  Perkins Coie \nlawyers are also representing clients in trademark and copyright matters before agencies, including \nover 60 matters before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), almost 2,000 pending \ntrademark matters before the USPTO, and approximately 145 pending copyright matters before \nthe Copyright Office.  Many of those patent and trademark clients also are known to have contracts \nwith the federal government.  And many of the firm’s practice areas, such as its White Collar & \nInvestigations group, rely almost exclusively on interacting with the federal government.    \nDefendants \n22.

In light of the fact that Perkins Coie’s attorneys interact with and appear before \nmore than 90 different federal agencies, and the Order at issue is directed generally to “all \nagencies,” the United States of America is included as a defendant to ensure that the relief ordered \nby the Court will apply on a government-wide basis, including to federal agencies that are not \nspecifically listed as defendants. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 12 of 43\n \nTHE FACTS \nRecent Relevant Litigation \n37.  In the wake of the 2020 election, Perkins Coie successfully handled numerous \nchallenges brought by the Trump campaign seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.  \nThese cases came on the heels of many pre-election cases involving voting rights, including cases \nwhere Perkins Coie succeeded in upholding existing laws.   \n38.  On March 24, 2022, Donald Trump sued a number of defendants, including Perkins \nCoie, Hilary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, Michael Sussmann, Marc Elias, and \nFusion GPS, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the \ndefendants “maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative” that Mr. Trump was colluding with \nRussia and engaged in actionable conduct regarding Fusion GPS and Alfa Bank.  See Dkt. 1, 2:22-\ncv-14102 (S.D. Fla.).  Mr. Trump asserted civil RICO claims against Perkins Coie for conspiring \nwith the Clinton campaign and sought to recover damages in excess of $24 million, before trebling, \nas well as attorney’s fees and lost profits.  On September 9, 2022, the District Court dismissed the \nlawsuit with prejudice, writing:  “As [defendants] view it, ‘whatever the utilities of the Amended \nComplaint as a fundraising tool, a press release, or a list of political grievances, it has no merit as \na lawsuit.’  I agree.”  Trump v. Clinton, 626 F. Supp. 3d 1264, 1284 (S.D. Fla. 2022).   \n39.  On February 6, 2025, Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit, Shilling v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-\n241  (W.D.  Wash.),  on  behalf  of  Commander Emily Shilling, Commander Blake Dremann, \nLieutenant Commander Geirid Morgan, Sergeant First Class Cathrine Schmid, Sergeant First \nClass Jane Doe, Staff Sergeant Videl Leins, Matthew Medina, and the Gender Justice League \nchallenging an Executive Order targeting transgender servicemembers.  Perkins Coie represents \nthe plaintiffs on a pro bono basis as co-counsel, along with Lambda Legal and the Human Rights \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 13 of 43\n \nCampaign.  Perkins Coie filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 19, 2025, asking \nthe court to bar implementation of that Executive Order until it could adjudicate the case, and the \ncourt ordered the government, while preliminary injunction briefing is underway, to notify the \ncourt immediately before making any changes to the status quo. \nThe Executive Order and Accompanying “Fact Sheet” \n40.  The President of the United States on March 6, 2025, issued the Executive Order \ntitled “Addressing Risks From Perkins Coie LLP.”  Ex. 1.1    \n41.  Section 1 of the Order falsely declares that Perkins Coie had engaged in “dishonest \nand dangerous activity” that has affected the country “for decades.”  As evidence of such so-called \n“dishonest  and  dangerous  activity,”  the  Order  cites  the  firm’s  representation  of  the  2016 \npresidential campaign of the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton, and the firm’s hiring of \nFusion GPS in the course of that representation, stating that Fusion “manufactured a false ‘dossier’ \ndesigned to steal an election.” \n42.  As further evidence of such supposed “dishonest and dangerous activity”—activity \nthat the Order brands as “egregious” and “part of a pattern”—the Order asserts that Perkins Coie \nhas worked “to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws” \nand that it has done so in association with so-called “activist donors.” \n43.  The Order does not mention the fact that Marc Elias, the lawyer who led the \nrepresentation of the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign is no longer employed by Perkins Coie.  \nNor does the Order mention the fact that the firm’s clients prevailed in all but one of the challenges \nbrought by the Trump campaign seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and the firm’s \n                                                 \n1 The exhibits referenced herein are attached to the declaration of Christopher N. Manning in \nsupport of Perkins Coie’s motion for a temporary restraining order, filed contemporaneously \nherewith. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 14 of 43\n \nclients also prevailed in a significant number of voting rights cases, including cases where it was \nsuccessful in upholding existing laws, relating to the 2020 election.  Also absent from the Order is \nany acknowledgment that, before his reelection, a federal court in Florida dismissed with prejudice \nthe President’s personal lawsuit against Perkins Coie alleging that the firm had conspired with the \nClinton campaign and others to weave a false narrative about Mr. Trump colluding with Russia to \ninterfere with the 2016 election.  The Order also omits that no one involved with the engagement \nof Fusion GPS remains at Perkins Coie. \n44.  Section 1 of the Order further declares that one court sanctioned Perkins Coie \nattorneys “for an unethical lack of candor before the court.”  The Order does not mention that the \nincident occurred in 2021; that the sanction, collectively, was $8,700; that the three sanctioned \nattorneys are no longer members of, or employed by, the firm; that what the court determined to \nbe a lack of candor was a failure to notify the court of appeals that a motion to supplement the \nrecord on appeal was “nearly identical” to an earlier motion to supplement the record when the \nattorneys had sought an emergency stay; and that, upon reconsideration, the court explained that a \nviolation of the local rules, without any need to find bad faith, supported the sanctions.   \n45.  Section 1 of the Order also declares that Perkins Coie “racially discriminates \nagainst its own attorneys and staff.”  It does not, and did not.  The allegedly discriminatory \npractices cited in the Order date back to 2019 and 2023; they did not exist then and they do not \nexist now.  And the Order does not purport to identify any current practices that discriminate on \nthe basis of the race.  It is true that Perkins Coie has a longstanding commitment to diversity and \ninclusion and has made, and continues to make, public statements advancing the ideals of diversity, \nequity, and inclusion.  But Perkins Coie does not, and did not, have percentage quotas for hiring \nor promoting minorities.  Reflecting the firm’s core values, Perkins Coie introduced a summer \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 15 of 43\n \nassociate program decades ago (in 1991) geared towards providing diverse first-year law students \nwith valuable professional experience.  Perkins Coie was one of the first law firms in the country \nto offer such an innovative program and expanded it in 2021 to include second-year law students.  \nAlthough the program was successful, following the Supreme Court’s decision on race-conscious \nadmissions in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. (SFFA) v. President & Fellows of Harvard \nCollege, 143 S. Ct. 2141 (2023), Perkins Coie reexamined its diversity initiatives to adapt to \nchanging jurisprudence. While this review was already in progress, the American Alliance for \nEqual Rights filed a lawsuit challenging Perkins Coie’s fellowship programs.  As a result of the \nlitigation, the firm’s leadership clarified that 1L and 2L diversity fellowships were open to all \napplicants.  In fact, Perkins Coie had previously awarded the fellowship to non-diverse applicants.  \nAmerican Alliance for Equal Rights consequently dismissed its lawsuit. \n46.  Section 1 relies on the false premise that, by promoting diversity in the legal \nprofession, Perkins Coie has engaged in “blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination” and \ntherefore, violated the public trust.  Section 1 wrongly concludes that diversity, equity, and \ninclusion policies “disrespect. . . the bed rock principle of equality” and therefore, represent good \ncause to terminate access to national security clearances and federal funds.  \n47.  Section 4 instructs the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(EEOC) to target “representative large, influential, or industry leading law firms”—like Perkins \nCoie—to determine if large law firms hire and promote individuals; permit client access; or \nprovide access to events, trainings, or travel “on a discriminatory basis.”  Section 4 further instructs \nthe Attorney General, in coordination with the Chair of the EEOC, to investigate large law firms \nwho do business with federal entities “for compliance with race-based and sex-based non-\n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 16 of 43\n \ndiscrimination laws and take any additional actions the Attorney General deems appropriate in \nlight of the evidence uncovered.”   \n48.  On the same day that the White House issued the Order, it also issued a so-called \n“Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from Perkins Coie LLP.”  That Fact \nSheet, Ex. 2, embellishes the Order’s allegations concerning Perkins Coie.  It characterizes the \nOrder as “Stopping Abuses That Undermine the Nation” and states that “President Trump’s \nAdministration will not tolerate Perkins Coie LLP’s unethical and discriminatory actions that \nthreaten our elections, military strength, and national security.” \n49.  Unlike the Order, which states that Perkins Coie, in the course of its representation \nof the Clinton campaign, hired a consultant that “manufactured a false ‘dossier’ designed to steal \nan election,” the Fact Sheet declares that the law firm hired the consultant for the very purpose of \npreparing a false document (“In 2016, Perkins Coie LLP hired Fusion GPS to manufacture a false \n‘dossier’ designed to steal an election ….”).  The Fact Sheet does not mention that a federal court \ndismissed President Trump’s suit because it was no more than “a fundraising tool, press release, \nor a list of political grievances,” and had no merit as a lawsuit.  Trump, 626 F. Supp. 3d at 1284.   \n50.  The Fact Sheet further explains the Order by stating that the law firm “pushed \ndebunked claims of secret Trump-Russia communications via Alfa Bank, with attorney Michael \nSussmann indicted for lying to the FBI about this scheme.”  The Fact Sheet does not mention that \na jury in this Court quickly and unanimously acquitted Mr. Sussmann, nor the fact that he resigned \nfrom the firm in 2021 and is now employed at a different law firm. \n51.  The  Fact  Sheet  repeats  the  same  false  and  disparaging  statements  about \ndiscrimination and lack of candor that the Order does.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 17 of 43\n \n52.  The Fact Sheet also repeats a myth that Perkins Coie “hosted an FBI workspace, \nraising concerns about partisan misuse of sensitive data during investigations targeting President \nTrump.”  That rumor was long ago debunked.  Like many law firms who represent clients involved \nin national security issues, the firm was permitted to install, at its own expense, a single-room \nSecure Work Environment (SWE) when it moved to its current building years ago.  The FBI’s \nonly involvement was examining and approving the security of the space.  Mr. Sussmann—who \nwas not in the firm’s Political Law practice and has not been at the firm for years—used that space \nas his office.  Perkins Coie no longer has a SWE. \n53.  Although the Order says nothing about “abuses” supposedly affecting military \nstrength and national security, the Fact Sheet purportedly explaining the Order states that “Perkins \nCoie LLP has filed lawsuits against the Trump Administration, including one designed to reduce \nmilitary readiness.”  On information and belief, that statement refers to the pending lawsuit brought \nby servicemembers, represented by Perkins Coie and others, challenging the Executive Order that \nbans transgender personnel from serving in the United States Armed Forces.  The firm represents \nthe plaintiffs on a pro bono basis. \nThe Retaliatory Character of the Executive Order and “Fact Sheet” \n54.  These many disparaging statements in the Order and Fact Sheet about Perkins Coie \nwere intended to constitute, and in fact do constitute, retaliation for the law firm’s representation \nof the President’s Democratic opponent in the 2016 election and of clients who, in 2016 and \nafterward, challenged and defended cases adverse to the President and his allies. \n55.  Only ten days before issuing the Order and Fact Sheet, the White House had issued \na memorandum to the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Attorney General, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and other agency heads directing them to suspend any active security \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 18 of 43\n \nclearances held by “all members, partners, and employees of Covington & Burling LLP who \nassisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith during his time as Special Counsel,” falsely referring \nto Mr. Smith’s service as “the weaponization of judicial process.”  That memorandum also directed \nthe same persons “to terminate any engagement of Covington & Burling LLP by any agency to \nthe maximum extent permitted by law ….” \n56.  Observers immediately understood and characterized the Order targeting Perkins \nCoie, like the earlier memorandum concerning Covington & Burling LLP, as retaliation against \nthe law firm for its association with, and representation of, the President’s political opponents.   \n57.  The Washington Post wrote that, through the Order directed at Perkins Coie, the \nAdministration “targeted another elite law firm that has represented clients the president considers \nhis political enemies.”  The Associated Press wrote that “the actions appear designed not only to \nsettle scores from years past but also to deter both government officials and private sector workers \nfrom participating in new inquiries into his conduct.”  Politico described the Order as “the latest \nchapter in the president’s campaign to punish his perceived political enemies,” noting the earlier \ntermination of security clearances for the lawyers representing Mr. Smith.  The Wall Street Journal \nnoted that the president “hasn’t shied away from punishing his enemies” and that his moves “have \nsent a chill through” the legal profession.  The New York Times recognized the Order as an \n“escalation of efforts to punish groups the president sees as aiding his enemies” and called it “a \nform of payback for [Perkin Coie’s] legal work for Democrats during the 2016 presidential \ncampaign.”  The Financial Times called the Order a “further move against lawyers that worked in \nopposition to him.”  And associates of the President have made clear that the Administration is \nmonitoring which lawyers and firms are representing his political opponents.  Elon Musk, for \nexample, reposted a story on X about lawsuits challenging the Administration’s cuts to funding at \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 19 of 43\n \nthe National Institutes of Health, asking, “Which law firms are pushing these anti-democratic cases \nto impede the will of the people?”   \n58.  In seeking comment on the Order, the press also determined that the Order was \nhaving an immediate chilling effect.  Law.com reported that “most law firm leaders are choosing \nto stay anonymous when speaking about the administration’s orders[.]”  It quoted one anonymous \nfirm leader as stating that “[n]ow firms need to consider the Trump administration backlash in \nclient intake,” and, another, that “‘you will see most firms take a more conservative approach to \ntaking on matters that piss off the administration.’”  Similarly, the Wall Street Journal cited \n“private conversations” with partners at the nation’s leading law firms who have declined to object \nto the Order “in part because of retaliation fears.”  The article also stated that “[a]dvocacy groups \nand smaller law firms say it has been more difficult to recruit larger firms to help with cases against \nTrump” and quoted a NAACP Legal Defense Fund employee as saying that “Law firms are not as \nvocal and as zealous” in their representations.  \n59.  Observers rightly recognized the Order as retaliation for Perkins Coie’s association \nwith, and advocacy on behalf of, the President’s political opponents because he repeatedly \npromised during his 2024 presidential campaign to retaliate against his perceived political enemies, \nincluding the lawyers who represented them. \n60.  In June 2024, in an interview with Sean Hannity, the President said, “Look, when \nthis election is over, based on what they’ve done, I would have every right to go after them ….” \nIn September 2024, Trump warned on Truth Social that “WHEN I WIN, those people that \nCHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law…. Please beware that this legal \nexposure extends to Lawyers….”  By October, NPR counted “100 threats to investigate, prosecute, \nimprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents.” \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 20 of 43\n \n61.  In signing the Order, the President confirmed this intention.  His staff secretary \nhanded him the Order, stating it was part of the effort “to hold those who engaged in lawfare \naccountable,” to which the President responded that Perkins Coie engaged in weaponization \n“against a political opponent” and “it should never be allowed to happen again.” \n62.  Since issuing the Order, the President has stated that his Administration will \ncontinue to retaliate against law firms that have represented persons that he perceives as political \nenemies.  Interviewed on March 9, 2025, the President said (and repeated), “We have a lot of law \nfirms that we are going to be going after.” \nThe Irreparable Harm to Perkins Coie \n63.  The Order does more than disparage Perkins Coie by declaring that the firm \nengages in “racial discrimination, falsified documents designed to weaponize the Government \nagainst candidates for office, and anti-democratic election changes that invite fraud and distrust[.]”  \nIt has caused clients to sever their relationship with the firm, and it incentivizes that in three ways. \n64.  First, the Order requires clients that are government contractors to disclose “any \nbusiness they do with Perkins Coie,” regardless of whether that business relates to the client’s \nfederal contracting work, where the consequence of such disclosure will be that “the heads of \nagencies shall … take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted \nby applicable law … for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service.”  The Fact \nSheet is even more explicit that contracts will, in fact, be terminated and that the purpose is \npunishment.  The Fact Sheet states, “[T]he Federal Government will prohibit funding contractors \nthat use Perkins Coie LLP.”  And it states that the Government will do so “[t]o ensure taxpayer \ndollars no longer go to contractors whose earnings subsidize partisan lawsuits against the United \nStates[.]” \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 21 of 43\n \n65.  Many of Perkins Coie’s largest clients (for example, the firm’s 15 largest clients, \ncollectively representing over $343 million in revenue in 2024, which represents almost a quarter \nof the firm’s revenue), or their affiliates, are known either to have, or to compete for, contracts or \nsubcontracts with the federal government, and many of those companies are represented by the \nfirm for legal matters completely unrelated to government-contracting matters.  For many of \nPerkins Coie’s clients, the fact that the firm gives them legal advice is not public information.  \nAccordingly, if implemented, the Order will seek to require clients to divulge confidential \ninformation  regarding  consultation  of  counsel  to  the  federal  government,  at  risk  that  the \nAdministration will then terminate the clients’ government contracts. \n66.  Second, the Order directs the heads of “all agencies” to limit the access of Perkins \nCoie attorneys and employees to federal buildings when access would be “inconsistent with the \ninterests of the United States,” to limit Government employees “from engaging with Perkins Coie \nemployees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United \nStates,” and to “refrain from hiring employees of Perkins Coie, absent a waiver from the head of \nthe agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.”   \n67.  Citing the Order, Government employees have already twice indicated that Perkins \nCoie attorneys should not, or could not, attend scheduled meetings.  The day after the President \nsigned the Order, an official of a federal agency, informed a client of Perkins Coie that, because \nof the Order, the client’s Perkins Coie lawyers should not attend a scheduled meeting with an \noffice in that agency to discuss a pending matter.   \n68.  On March 6, an attorney in the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, informed Perkins Coie that the Criminal Division could not proceed with a \nscheduled meeting relating to a firm client.  The attorney stated that he was awaiting further \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 22 of 43\n \nguidance as to whether the Criminal Division could meet at all with the firm’s lawyers in light of \nthe Order.  This postponement has threatens the ability of that client to achieve a swift resolution \nof the matter. \n69.  Third, the Order directs the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, \nand the “relevant heads of executive departments” immediately to suspend any security clearances \nof Perkins Coie attorneys pending a review of whether such clearances “are consistent with the \nnational interest.”  The Order thus gives clients, like defense contractors, reason to sever ties with \nlawyers that lack clearances and to retain lawyers who have or can secure the requisite clearances, \nparticularly when those clients can have no assurance that the review of Perkins Coie’s clearances \nwill be timely, much less that it will be favorable given the retaliatory character of the Order. \n70.  Because of the Order—including the restrictions imposed on Perkins Coie, the \nobligations imposed on, and risk of contract termination faced by clients with government \ncontracts, the uncertainty, and the Government animus to the firm reflected by the Order—several \nclients have already terminated, or have communicated that they are considering terminating, their \nlegal engagements with Perkins Coie.  This is a rapidly evolving situation, which changes by the \nhour.  Some clients have reported very concerning messages from government officials directing \nthem to report business with Perkins Coie, and others are concerned about that possibility \n71.  One client informed Perkins Coie within hours of the Order’s release that, due to \nthe Order, Perkins Coie cannot represent that client in any litigation or before the relevant federal \nagency. \n72.  A major government-contractor client for over 35 years withdrew its work from \nPerkins Coie in light of the Order as of March 7.  Shortly before the Order, that client had added \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 23 of 43\n \nPerkins Coie to its preferred-provider program, and annual billings to the client have often been in \nthe millions of dollars. \n73.  Another government-contractor that has been a firm client since 2018 has also \nwithdrawn all work from the firm as a result of the Order as of March 7. \n74.  A group of four clients have withdrawn all work from the firm as of March 7, due \nto  their  need  to  engage  with  various  federal  agencies,  including  the  Drug  Enforcement \nAdministration, Health and Human Services, and the Department of Justice (DOJ). \n75.  Another major government-contractor client for over 10 years informed the firm on \nMarch 7 that it is reconsidering its engagements with Perkins Coie unless something changes in \nterms of the Order’s requirements. \n76.  Another client indicated on March 7 that it is now considering retention of an \nalternative firm to represent it in connection with a DOJ investigation. \n77.  Because  of  the  uncertainty  created  by  the  Order,  many  clients  have  begun \nrequesting frequent updates relating to the Order in order to assess whether Perkins Coie can \ncontinue to represent them.   The time that Perkins Coie’s attorneys spend attending to these \ninquiries is a present and irreparable cost to Perkins Coie, because its lawyers (like most lawyers) \nare compensated by clients for their time.  Every hour spent responding to the Order is an hour \nthat an attorney cannot spend serving his or her clients on their cases and other matters.  Both \nPerkins Coie’s clients and its bottom line are harmed every day the Order is left undisturbed.  \nPerkins Coie’s largest clients want to keep using the firm, but are reviewing the relationship, their \ngovernment contracts, and other government interactions, and have indicated that they will need \nto make decisions shortly.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 24 of 43\n \n78.  Perkins Coie has already lost significant revenue due to the loss of clients who \nterminated their engagements in the few days since the Order was issued.  Like any law firm or \nbusiness, Perkins Coie has debts, obligations and expenses.  Upon information and belief, Perkins \nCoie will continue to lose existing and prospective clients if the Order is allowed to stand, and the \nlosses would be such as to jeopardize the firm’s long-term health.   \n79.  The Order also threatens the right of Perkins Coie attorneys to practice their chosen \nprofession.  That threat is not only to revenue-generating practice, but also to the firm’s pro bono \npractice, as Perkins Coie attorneys frequently appear in federal court and before federal agencies \nin criminal, civil, or administrative matters.  The firm is built around representation of clients who \ninteract with the federal government. \n80.  The Order has also adversely affected and will continue to affect the firm’s \nrecruiting and, potentially, retention of employees.  Since the issuance of the Order, business-\nprofessional candidates to whom offers have been extended have questioned the economic health \nof the firm and whether there will be layoffs.  At least one interviewee asked questions obviously \nprompted by the Order.  The firm also has a recruiting event within the next two weeks that is \nfocused on practice before a federal court of appeals, from which the firm historically has hired \nclerks to practice in areas related to government contracts, international trade, and intellectual \nproperty.  The Order will dissuade talented candidates from joining Perkins Coie under fear that \nthey will be foreclosed from later entering service with the federal government \n81.  The Order also interferes with Perkins Coie’s employer–employee relationships \nbecause the restrictions are broadly written to include Perkins Coie employees. \n82.  The Order has also harmed and will harm Perkins Coie’s reputation in the market \nthrough its false and disparaging characterizations of the firm and its attorneys.      \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 25 of 43\n \n83.  In short: the Order has had its intended effect already—irreparable impact that will \nonly continue to grow.  The disparagement of the firm, which signals to present and prospective \nclients alike that it is persona non grata with the Administration, combined with the threat of \ntermination of clients’ government contracts and suspension of security clearances, has caused \nfinancial and reputational harm to the firm.  By reason of the Order, the firm has lost clients, lost \nbusiness (as clients have withdrawn business or given new business to other firms), and received \nworried  inquiries  from  clients,  including  its  largest  clients,  which  question  whether  it  can \nadequately represent them in light of the Administration’s demonstrated animus.   \n84.  The Order has had, and will continue to have, a chilling effect on whether and how \nPerkins Coie will litigate on behalf of certain clients, and is having a chilling effect on attorneys \nand other persons considering employment with the firm.  These consequences will continue to \nmount if the Order is allowed to stand. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Against All Defendants) \nUltra Vires Presidential Action – Unconstitutional Exercise of Judicial Authority \n85.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n86.  Fundamental to the Constitution is that the separation of powers prevents the \n“concentrat[ion] [of] the roles of prosecutor, judge, and jury in the hands of the Executive Branch.”  \nSEC v. Jarkesy, 603 U.S. 109, 140 (2024).  The separation of powers “protects the liberty of the \nindividual from arbitrary power.”  Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011). \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 26 of 43\n \n87.  The President’s authority to act must “stem either from an act of Congress or from \nthe Constitution itself.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952). \n88.  There is no enumerated or inherent executive authority from the Constitution to \nregulate and to sanction lawyers for professional misconduct.  That is not part of the President’s \n“core constitutional power[].”  Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 606 (2024).  Nor is it one of \nhis “incidental powers, belonging to the executive department, which are necessarily implied from \nthe nature of the functions.”  Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 749 (1982) (quoting 3 Joseph \nStory, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1563 (1st ed. 1833)). \n89.  The Order also identifies no constitutional or statutory source of authority.  The \nOrder  is  ultra  vires  because  there  is  “no  express  constitutional  or  statutory  authorization” \nempowering the President to retaliate against and punish Plaintiff for representing clients outside \nof agency proceedings.  Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 316 U.S. 317, 331 (1942). \n90.  The Judicial Branch, not the President, has the inherent authority to regulate the \nlegal practice.  See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991).  Such authority “includes \nthe ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.” \nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger, 581 U.S. 101, 107 (2017) (cleaned up).  Courts find facts \nto  support  punishments  limiting  private  rights  of  liberty,  property,  and  contract.    See \nGranfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 54–56 (1989).  And they impose punishments only \nafter ensuring due process.  See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 161 \n(1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n91.  Article III of the Constitution vests the “judicial Power of the United States” in the \nfederal courts.  That power enables courts “to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into \neffect between persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision.”  Muskrat v. United \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 27 of 43\n \nStates, 219 U.S. 346, 356 (1911) (quoting Samuel Freeman Miller, Lectures on the Constitution \nof the United States 314 (1891)). \n92.  Section 1 of the Order purports to find that Perkins Coie has engaged in “dishonest \nand dangerous activity” and “worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially \noverturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws.”  It then falsely asserts that \nPerkins Coie “undermin[es] democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law \nenforcement”  and  “racially  discriminates  against  its  own  attorneys  and  staff,  and  against \napplicants.”   \n93.  Section 3 of the Order relies on Section 1 to penalize Perkins Coie for its legal \nadvocacy  by  instructing  “Government  contracting  agencies  …  [to]  require  Government \ncontractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie,” “to terminate any contract … for \nwhich Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service,” and to report on actions taken with \nrespect to “contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that do business with Perkins Coie.”  It thus \nstrips Perkins Coie’s clients and business partners of their government contracts.   \n94.  Likewise, wielding the purported findings of Section 1, Section 5 of the Order \nrestricts Perkins Coie employees’ “access [to] Federal Government buildings” and limits Perkins \nCoie employees’ ability to “engag[e]” with government personnel. \n95.  No statute authorizes these actions.  Nor could one exist, because the power to \nimpose penalties for legal advocacy—after an adjudication of the facts accordant with due \nprocess—rests with federal and state courts.   \n96.  The President punishes Perkins Coie with an order that shares all the essential \nfeatures of a bill of attainder.  The Order thus invades judicial power by adjudicating facts to \nsupport a restriction of Plaintiff’s private rights in a way the Constitution prohibits the legislature \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 28 of 43\n \nfrom doing.  The Constitution prohibits presidents from arrogating judicial power unto themselves \nto “pronounce[] upon the guilt of [Plaintiff] … in accordance [solely] with [their] own notions.”  \nCummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 323 (1866).   \n97.  The Order is therefore ultra vires because it violates the separation of powers by \nexercising judicial power and because no statute grants such authority. \n98.  The ultra vires nature of the Order has already harmed, and continues to harm, \nPlaintiff. \nCOUNT II \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Deprivation of Procedural Due Process \n \n99.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n100.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution \nguarantees that “no person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law.”         \n101.  The Order interferes with and impairs multiple liberty and property interests \nprotected by the Due Process Clause.  Perkins Coie represents clients in federal-court litigation \nand in matters before federal agencies.  In order to provide legal services, Perkins Coie is required \nto access federal government buildings and engage with federal government employees.  The \nOrder impairs Perkins Coie’s ability to follow its chosen profession by limiting its ability to \npractice law, including its ability to represent clients in court and before agencies, and to contract \nwith the federal government.  The Order also impairs Perkins Coie’s private contracts with its \nclients.    The  Order  harms  Perkins  Coie’s  constitutionally  protected  property  interests  by \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 29 of 43\n \nprohibiting Perkins Coie from participating in federal contracting and seeking to terminate private \ncontractual relationships between Perkins Coie and its clients.  The Order harms Perkins Coie’s \ncognizable reputation interest by stigmatizing Perkins Coie as dishonest, untrustworthy and \nracially discriminatory.  The Order also deprives Perkins Coie of its liberty interest in its First \nAmendment right to petition the government because it restricts access to governmental facilities \nand governmental personnel.   \n102.  Perkins Coie did not receive notice prior to being subjected to the Order.  Perkins \nCoie was not aware, prior to the issuance of the Order, of the conduct that would subject it to \npunishment or the severity of the potential punishment.  \n103.  Defendants did not provide Perkins Coie with any opportunity to challenge the \npurported factual findings or the sanctions in the Order prior to their announcement.  Following \nthe issuance of the Order, Perkins Coie has not been given an opportunity by Defendants to \nchallenge the Executive Order. \n104.  No  compelling  government  interest  justifies  Defendants’  violation  of  Perkins \nCoie’s  due  process  rights.   The  decision  to  adopt  the  Order  was  based  on  improper \npurposes.  Among other improper purposes, the Order was adopted for retaliatory reasons, and in \norder to punish Perkins Coie for exercising rights protected by the First Amendment.  The Order \nis based on false premises, but even assuming that it were not, the sanctions it imposes would be \nwildly disproportionate.  Indeed, the President’s choice to punish an entire law firm—rather than \nthe handful of attorneys allegedly responsible for the misconduct the Order purports to identify—\nclarifies the retaliatory nature and gross disproportionality of the Order.  So too its focus singling \nout Perkins Coie from among similarly situated firms.  This improper purpose and absence of any \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 30 of 43\n \nlegitimate justification demonstrates that the Order is an abusive, irrational abuse of power that \nshocks the conscience, such that it could not be justified by any level of process. \n105.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Perkins Coie’s Fifth Amendment right to due \nprocess has been violated.  Defendants’ violation of due process has caused Perkins Coie to suffer \nongoing and irreparable harm. \nCOUNT III \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Deprivation of Due Process (Void for Vagueness) \n106.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n107.   A federal law is unconstitutionally vague and thus violates due process if it “fails \nto provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless \nthat it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.”  United States v. Williams, \n553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008) (citing Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000)); see also Johnson v. \nUnited States, 576 U.S. 591, 595 (2015).   \n108.  The Order is unconstitutionally vague and violates the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  It does not provide Perkins Coie with a basis to \nunderstand what conduct is prohibited or how to avoid further sanctions in the future.  The Order \nalso  does  not  provide  any  guidance  on  which  interactions  and  buildings,  and  in  what \ncircumstances, its employees are restricted from.  The Order’s vagueness also permits Defendants \nto engage in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement against Perkins Coie. \n109.  The Order also fails to provide adequate notice as to what are prohibited “diversity, \nequity, and inclusion” policies.  The Order is unconstitutionally vague because Perkins Coie \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 31 of 43\n \ncannot know whether it can hire, promote, staff or train employees who are racial minorities or \nunspecified “other categories prohibited by civil rights laws.”  Nor can Perkins Coie know how it \nis  deemed  untrustworthy  to  have  access  to  national  security  information  simply  because  it \nembraces programs and policies that are deemed by the Order to be discriminatory “diversity, \nequity, and inclusion” policies.   The Order threatens and compels various punishments and \ninvestigations against Perkins Coie because of its “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies.  \nBecause the order is vague with respect to prohibited “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies it \nis a violation of the firm’s constitutional due process rights. \n110.  The Order’s threatened investigation and enforcement action by the EEOC and the \nDepartment of Justice against Perkins Coie because of the firm’s vaguely defined “diversity, \nequity, and inclusion” policies makes it a violation of the firm’s constitutional due process rights. \n111.  The Order’s threatened suspension of active security clearances held by Perkins \nCoie employees because of the firm’s vaguely defined “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies \nmakes it a violation of the firm’s constitutional due process rights. \n112.  The Order’s threatened termination of contracts or funding with Perkins Coie or \nentities doing business with Perkins Coie because of the firm’s vaguely defined “diversity, equity, \nand inclusion” policies makes it a violation of the firm’s constitutional due process rights. \n113.  The Order’s threatened limitation of access to Federal property and engaging with \ngovernment employees because of the firm’s vaguely defined “diversity, equity, and inclusion” \npolicies make it a violation of the firm’s constitutional due process rights. \n114.  The Order’s threatened prevention of the hiring of Perkins Coie employees for \nFederal positions because of the firm’s vaguely defined “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies \nmakes it a violation of the firm’s constitutional due process rights. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 32 of 43\n \n115.  No  compelling  government  interest  justifies  Defendants’  violation  of  Perkins \nCoie’s due process rights.  The decision to adopt the Order was based on improper purposes.  \nAmong other improper purposes, the Order was adopted for retaliatory reasons, and in order to \npunish Perkins Coie for exercising rights protected by the First Amendment.  The Order is based \non false premises, but even assuming that it were not, the sanctions it imposes would be wildly \ndisproportionate.  Indeed, the President’s choice to punish an entire law firm—rather than the \nhandful of attorneys allegedly responsible for the misconduct the Order purports to identify—\nclarifies the retaliatory nature and gross disproportionality of the Order.  So too does its singling \nout of Perkins Coie from among similarly situated firms.  This improper purpose and absence of \nany legitimate justification demonstrates that the Order is an abusive, irrational abuse of power \nthat shocks the conscience, such that it could not be justified by any level of process. \n116.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Perkins Coie’s Fifth Amendment right to due \nprocess has been violated.  Defendants’ violation of due process has caused Perkins Coie to suffer \nongoing and irreparable harm. \nCOUNT IV \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Denial of Equal Protection \n117.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n118.  The Equal Protection Clause as incorporated by the Fifth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution prohibits the federal government, its agencies, its officials, and its employees \nfrom denying persons the equal protection of the laws.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 33 of 43\n \n119.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  bars  the  government  from  disfavoring similarly \nsituated individuals without a constitutionally legitimate basis.  Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000).   \n120.  To justify discriminatory conduct, the government must put forward a “plausible \nreason” for its differential treatment, FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313-14 \n(1993), which cannot be “so attenuated” from its conduct “as to render [it] arbitrary or irrational.”  \nCity of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985) (citing, inter alia, \nUnited States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 535 (1973)).  “[A] bare desire \nto harm a politically unpopular group” is “not [a] legitimate state interest[].”  City of Cleburne, \n473 U.S. at 447.   \n121.  The purpose of the Order is to discriminate against Perkins Coie.  The Order \nintentionally targets Perkins Coie with extraordinary sanctions not levied on other, materially \nsimilarly situated firms or lawyers.   \n122.  The improper motive behind the Order is also apparent on its face and through the \nPresident’s related public statements, as well as the statements of members of his Administration.   \n123.  The government lacks even a rational justification for the Order.  Among other \nthings, the Order targets a 1,200-lawyer, 21-office international law firm based on almost ten-year-\nold allegations that courts have rejected and that involve partners whom Perkins Coie has not \nemployed for several years.  The Order expressly seeks to punish Perkins Coie for representing \nclients in lawsuits that successfully struck down unconstitutional election laws and defeated \nchallenges brought by President Trump or his allies to the results of the 2020 election.  There is \nnot a shred of evidence of any national security threat from Perkins Coie, let alone one sufficient \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 34 of 43\n \nto justify barring Perkins Coie from engaging in government contracts, interacting with federal \nemployees, and accessing federal buildings.   \n124.  The Order is therefore in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  \n125.  The Order’s violations cause ongoing and irreparable harm to Perkins Coie. \nCOUNT V \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Denial of First Amendment \nFree Speech and Associational Rights (Political Viewpoint Discrimination) \n126.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n127.  The First Amendment prohibits the regulation or censure of speech based on “‘the \nspecific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker.’”  Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 168-69 (2015) (quoting Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., \n515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995)).  Such government action is a “‘blatant’ and ‘egregious form of content \ndiscrimination’” and is subject to strict scrutiny.  Reed, 576 U.S. at 168, 171. \n128.  The  Order  (and  Fact  Sheet  explaining  it)  constitute  viewpoint  discrimination \nbecause they single out and punish Perkins Coie for its association with, and advocacy on behalf \nof, the President’s political opponents in the 2016 and 2020 elections. \n129.  The Order and Fact Sheet do not distinguish between the client’s viewpoint and the \nfirm’s zealous advocacy of that viewpoint, but attribute the viewpoint to the firm and retaliate \nagainst the firm on that basis. \n130.  The Order’s viewpoint discrimination is all the more egregious because it concerns \nspeech that is at the core of First Amendment protection—i.e., speech concerning the election of \ncandidates to national office and what the law should be governing those elections. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 35 of 43\n \n131.  Viewpoint discrimination that is retaliatory cannot be justified by any government \ninterest.  Even if the Order were not retaliatory in purpose and in the public’s perception, as it \nclearly is, no compelling interest can support the Order.  It is the job of the courts to police \nmisconduct by the lawyers who appear before them, and it is the job of state bars to discipline \nethical misconduct by members of the bar.  The President has no authority in these areas.  Here, \nmoreover, the President has presented his claims concerning the 2016 election to a federal court, \nand that court has dismissed his case.  He presented his claims regarding the 2020 election to \nnumerous courts without material success, frequently losing to parties represented by Perkins Coie.  \nNor can there be any compelling government interest in punishing the entire Perkins Coie firm of \nover 1,200 lawyers and over 1,200 non-lawyer professionals now, in 2025, when the purportedly \noffending speech (i) occurred years ago and (ii) involved a mere handful of lawyers (iii) none of \nwhom are members or employees of the firm today. \n132.  The First Amendment forbids the government’s use of a patronage system whereby \nit  conditions  government  benefits,  such  as  contracts,  access  to  government  facilities  or \nemployment, or security clearances on political support or affiliation.  Even where there is no right \nto a government benefit, the government cannot revoke or condition benefits on grounds that \nviolate the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech and association.  The Order punishes \nPerkins Coie for the lack of political fealty and conditions the further receipt of government \nbenefits on adherence to the President’s political points of view.   \n133.  The First Amendment protects the right to petition the government for redress of \ngrievances.  Such petition includes seeking relief in courts of law and agencies of government.  \nThe Order violates that right by denying the ability of Perkins Coie lawyers to enter public \nbuildings and, even short of entry, communicate and meet with government employees (two of \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 36 of 43\n \nwhom have already refused to meet with Perkins Coie lawyers, as scheduled before issuance of \nthe Order). \n134.  Facially  overbroad  regulation  violates  the  First  Amendment  because  it  chills \nprotected speech.  The Order and Fact Sheet are facially overbroad, inter alia, because they do not \ndefine  what  constitutes  “dishonest  and  dangerous  activity.”    The  Order,  on  its  face,  also \nencompasses  legally  protected  activity,  such  as  petitioning  the  government  for  redress  of \ngrievances in the courts. \n135.  The Order’s violations cause ongoing and irreparable harm to Perkins Coie. \nCOUNT VI \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Denial of First Amendment \nFree Speech and Associational Rights (Compelled Disclosures) \n136.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n137.  The First Amendment limits the government’s ability to compel individuals to \ndisclose their “affiliation[s] with groups engaged in advocacy.”  NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. \nPatterson, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958).  Such compelled disclosures must satisfy “exacting scrutiny,” \na standard that requires the government to show that there is “a substantial relation between the \ndisclosure  requirement  and  a  sufficiently  important  governmental  interest.”    Americans  for \nProsperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 607 (2021). \n138.  Section 3 of the Order “require[s] [g]overnment contractors to disclose any business \nthey do with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government \ncontract.” \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 37 of 43\n \n139.  Perkins Coie has third-party standing to assert the First Amendment rights of its \nclients who are subject to Section 3 because (i) Perkins Coie’s right to freedom of association is \nburdened by the disclosure requirements and the disclosure requirements will cause Perkins Coie \nto lose clients; (ii) Perkins Coie has a close relationship with its clients; and (iii) Perkins Coie’s \nclients are hindered from challenging the disclosure requirements and protecting their First \nAmendment rights because the act of challenging the disclosure requirements would require the \nclients to disclose their relationship with Perkins Coie.  See Ctr. for Democracy & Tech. v. Trump, \n507 F. Supp. 3d 213, 223–24 (D.D.C. 2020). \n140.  The government’s interest—retaliating against Perkins Coie for First-Amendment-\nprotected activity of which the President disapproves—is not “sufficiently important” to withstand \nexacting scrutiny.   \n141.  Requiring all “[g]overnment contractors to disclose any business they do with \nPerkins Coie” irrespective of “whether that business is related to the subject of the Government \ncontract,” EO § 3, is not the kind of “narrow specificity” required by the First Amendment, Nat’l \nAss’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963).   \n142.  Section 3 of the Order is facially unconstitutional. \n143.  This constitutional violation causes ongoing and irreparable harm to Perkins Coie. \nCOUNT VII \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Denial of First Amendment Free Speech and Associational Rights \n(Retaliation for Statements in Favor of Diversity and Inclusion) \n \n144.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 38 of 43\n \n145.  Perkins Coie has a longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion and has \nmade, and continues to make, public statements advancing the ideals of diversity, equity, and \ninclusion.  Such statements of political opinion are core protected speech. \n146.  The Order’s viewpoint discrimination stems from the threatened investigation and \nenforcement action against Perkins Coie because it embraces programs and policies that are \ndeemed by the Order to be discriminatory “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies.   \n147.  Section 1 of the Order falsely asserts that Perkins Coie, by espousing views \nsupportive of diversity and inclusion, has “disrespect[ed] . . .the bedrock principle of equality” and \nconcludes that good cause therefore exists to terminate Perkins Coie’s national security clearances \nand access to any federal funds.  Such allegations are bad faith, pretextual, and lack any basis in \nfact. \n148.  The Order’s threatened investigation and enforcement action by the EEOC and \nthe Department of Justice against Perkins Coie because it embraces programs and policies that \nespouse a belief in “diversity, equity, and inclusion” makes it a violation of the firm’s First \nAmendment right of free expression. \n149.  The Order’s threatened suspension of active security clearances held by Perkins \nCoie employees because the firm embraces programs and policies that espouse a belief in \n“diversity, equity, and inclusion” makes it a violation of the firm’s First Amendment right of free \nexpression. \n150.  The Order’s threatened termination of contracts or funding with Perkins Coie or \nentities doing business with Perkins Coie because the firm embraces programs and policies that \nespouse a belief in “diversity, equity, and inclusion” makes it a violation of the firm’s First \nAmendment right of free expression. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 39 of 43\n \n151.  Section 4(a) of the Order unconstitutionally retaliates against Perkins Coie for First \nAmendment protected speech supporting and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the \nlegal profession and orders the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to \ninvestigate “representative large, influential or industry leading law firms”—like Perkins Coie—\nto determine if discriminatory hiring and promotion practices exist.  \n152.  Section 4(b) instructs the Attorney General, in coordination with the Chair of the \nEqual  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  and  the  State  Attorneys  General,  to  conduct \ncompliance investigations of any “large law firms”—like Perkins Coie—who do business with \nfederal entities and to take “additional actions” deemed appropriate by the Attorney General “in \nlight of the evidence uncovered.”   \n153.  The threatened investigations into Perkin Coie’s hiring, retention, promotion, and \ntraining practices constitute a “retaliatory action sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness \nin [Perkins Coie’s] position from speaking again” and would thus be cognizable.  Aref v. Lynch, \n833 F.3d 242, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  See Smith v. Plati, 258 F.3d 1167, 1176 (10th Cir. 2001) \n(Retaliatory  actions  “that  would  chill  a  person  of  ordinary  firmness”  include  “prosecution, \nthreatened prosecution, bad faith investigation, and legal harassment.”). \n154.  The threat of an investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \nand/or the Department of Justice imposes costs on Perkins Coie, including the potential costs of \nlitigation and the need to redirect dedicated resources from other purposes to engage with the \ninvestigation.  Those harms are in addition to the reputational harms imposed on Perkins Coie by \nthe false allegations in the Order which have resulted or will result in the loss of clients, employees, \nand prestige. \n155.  The Order, thus, violates the First Amendment. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 40 of 43\n \n156.  That violation causes ongoing and irreparable harm to Perkins Coie. \nCOUNT VIII \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Denial of Right to Counsel (Sixth Amendment) \n157.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n158.  The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that “[i]n all \ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the Assistance of Counsel for \nhis defence.”  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  The Sixth Amendment affords criminal defendants the right \nto effective assistance provided by the counsel of one’s choosing.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 \nU.S. 668, 686 (1984); Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159 (1988).  Actions that substantially \ninterfere with, or deprive, the right to counsel constitute a violation of the Sixth Amendment. \n159.  Lawyers have prudential, third-party standing to challenge violations of their \nclients’ Sixth Amendment or Due Process rights to counsel that interfere with the lawyers’ \npractice.  Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624 n.3 (1989); U.S. Dep’t \nof Lab. v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720 (1990).  In particular, because an attorney’s duty to provide \neffective counsel “may not be fettered by harassment of government officials,” a lawyer has \n“standing to challenge any act which interferes with his professional obligation to his client and \nthereby, through the lawyer, invades the client’s constitutional right to counsel.”  Wounded Knee \nLegal Def. v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 507 F.2d 1281, 1284 (8th Cir. 1974).  Because the firm \nrepresents criminal defendants and others in dealings with the government, it has standing to \nchallenge the Order’s attempted interference with its clients’ rights to counsel. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 41 of 43\n \n160.  The Order violates the firm’s clients’ Sixth Amendment rights to counsel because \nit directs “the heads of all agencies” without exception to “limit[] Government employees acting \nin their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees” and thus significantly \nimpairs Perkins Coie’s ability to advance clients’ interests before the government. \n161.  The Order violates the firm’s clients’ Sixth Amendment rights to counsel because \nit directs “the heads of all agencies” without exception to “limit[] official access from Federal \nGovernment buildings to employees of Perkins Coie” and thus significantly impairs Perkins Coie’s \nability to advance clients’ interests before the government. \n162.  The  Order  also  violates  the  firm’s  clients’  Sixth  Amendment  rights  to  their \npreferred counsel because it “require[s] Government contractors to disclose any business they do \nwith Perkins Coie” and thus compels clients to choose between their livelihood and their preferred \ncounsel. \n163.  The Order is therefore in violation of the Sixth Amendment. \n164.  This violation causes ongoing and irreparable harm to Perkins Coie. \nCOUNT IX \n(Against All Defendants) \nUnconstitutional Denial of Right to Counsel (Fifth Amendment) \n165.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n166.  Lawyers and clients have due process interests in their contractual and professional \nrelationships.   \n167.  The Order’s sanctions interfere with and chill all of those representations and \nrelationships.  Like the firm’s other due process interests, the Order failed to provide adequate \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 42 of 43\n \nprocess before interfering with the firm’s and clients’ due process rights to counsel.  And because \nthese sanctions—which punish a firm for successful lawsuits and threaten the firm’s clients—are \nnot rationally related to a legitimate government interest they cannot stand.   \n168.  The Order’s violations cause ongoing and irreparable harm to Perkins Coie and its \nclients. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Perkins Coie respectfully requests that the Court: \n169.   Declare the Executive Order unconstitutional as violative of the Separation of \nPowers and Article II of and the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. \n170.  Immediately enjoin implementation of the Order pending consideration of a motion \nfor preliminary injunction. \n171.  Preliminarily, then permanently, enjoin implementation of the Order. \n172.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \n   \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 43 of 43\n \nDated: March 11, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n            WILLIAMS & CONNOLLY LLP \n              By:  /s/ Dane H.

Perkins Coie lawyers are among the nation’s best.  They \npractice at the highest levels of the profession in federal and state courts across the country, before \nmore than 90 federal agencies, and in varied transactional settings.  They serve their communities \nas Sunday school teachers, Scout leaders, youth sports coaches, military reservists, and board \nmembers of civic organizations.  Presidents from both political parties, including President Trump, \nhave appointed Perkins Coie lawyers to serve as federal judges.  Perkins Coie’s staff have called \nthe Firm one of the “Best Companies to Work For” for over 20 years.  Perkins Coie lawyers devote \ncountless hours to providing free legal services to those who cannot afford to pay.  In 2024 alone, \nPerkins Coie lawyers worked over 89,000 hours on pro bono matters valued at nearly $70 million. \nLawyers protect and promote our cherished freedoms, including the rights to free speech \nand to petition the government, and safeguard the rule of law that underpins our democratic system.  \nCritical to this role is lawyers’ time-honored duty to advocate zealously for their clients, no matter \nhow controversial.  Zealous advocacy serves as a bulwark against government abuses that erode \nthe rule of law.  In keeping with the highest tradition of the legal profession, Perkins Coie has \nzealously advocated for its clients in matters large and small since the Firm’s founding more than \na century ago.  The President’s Executive Order attacks Perkins Coie and its clients for that advo-\ncacy.  The Firm already has suffered significant harm, and that harm is increasing every day. \nThe Order defames Perkins Coie’s 1,200 lawyers as “dishonest” and “dangerous” without \nbasis.  And it seeks to punish Perkins Coie based on a tiny sliver of the Firm’s work:  The Order \ncriticizes the representations by former Perkins Coie lawyers almost a decade ago of clients that \nthe President perceives as his political enemies, as well as the Firm’s present representation of \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 13 of 57\n \nclients in litigation that challenges his Administration’s policies.  The retaliatory punishment the \nOrder imposes is unprecedented.  It purports to restrict access to federal buildings for every one of \nthe 2,500 lawyers and employees of the Firm.  It instructs federal agencies to refuse to meet with \nPerkins Coie lawyers and staff or even engage with them.  It instructs federal agencies to terminate \ncontracts held by firm clients, for the express goal of causing clients to sever their relationships \nwith their trusted Perkins Coie lawyers.  The Order is not just an attempt to constrain or weaken \nPerkins Coie; its objective is to destroy the Firm.  Unless restrained, the Order realistically might \nsucceed in that objective within days based on the weight of the federal pressure being deployed \nagainst the Firm’s clients.   \nThe Order is unconstitutional from top to bottom.  While styled an Executive Order, the \nOrder is not really executive at all.  It purports instead to adjudicate whether a handful of former \nPerkins Coie lawyers committed misconduct (as defined by the President) years ago, and then to \npunish the entire Firm with terminal sanctions for those lawyers’ supposed transgressions.  It \nmakes these adjudicative “findings” without notice to Perkins Coie and without an opportunity to \nbe heard and to contest the Order’s false claims.  If Congress had enacted legislation mirroring the \nExecutive Order, it would be an unconstitutional bill of attainder.  The Constitution likewise bars \nthe President from punishing his political opponents’ law firms with a sweep of the pen.     \nThe Order does not even try to disguise its retaliatory purpose.  The President promised \nduring the campaign to retaliate against his political opponents, including the attorneys who rep-\nresented them (“WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the Law…. Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers….”).  The Order \nmakes good on that threat.  The President confirmed as much at the signing ceremony, when he \nstated that Perkins Coie had engaged in weaponization “against a political opponent” (i.e., himself) \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 14 of 57\n \nand tried to justify the Order by touting the chilling effect it will have on lawyers’ representations \nof their clients (“it should never be allowed to happen again”).   \nAlthough the Executive Order is expressly political, its consequences are not.  The Order \nalready has produced several harmful effects for Perkins Coie and its clients.  Government officials \nalready have invoked the Order to refuse to meet with Perkins Coie attorneys—including on mat-\nters having nothing to do with presidential politics or government contracting.  Agencies already \nhave asked Perkins Coie clients to disclose whether they have a relationship with the Firm.  Some \nclients already have chosen to move work elsewhere.  And other clients have expressed grave \nconcern about the consequences of continuing to retain Perkins Coie if this illegal Order is not \nenjoined.  Without an immediate restraining order, significant additional client relationships likely \nwill be lost within days.  The Order thus poses an imminent, ongoing threat to the Firm’s survival. \nAlthough the entire Executive Order is invalid, this Court should temporarily restrain at \nleast Sections 1, 3, and 5.  The constitutional violations are plain.   \nFirst, the Order exceeds the President’s constitutional and statutory authority and thus vi-\nolates the separation of powers.  The President has no valid authority to adjudicate and punish \nalleged misconduct by a law firm in its general representation of clients.   \nSecond, the Order blatantly violates the First Amendment by retaliating against the Firm \nand its attorneys for associating with clients and advocating positions the President disfavors and \nby discriminating against the Firm and its attorneys on the basis of viewpoint.   \nThird, the Order deprives Perkins Coie and its attorneys of their liberty and property inter-\nests without any semblance of due process of law.   \nFourth, the Order unlawfully interferes with the ability of Perkins Coie and its attorneys to \nrepresent their clients in violation of the Sixth Amendment and Due Process Clause.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 15 of 57\n \nFifth, the Order deprives Perkins Coie and its attorneys of equal protection of the law by \nsingling out and targeting the law firm based on raw animus.     \nIn short, the Executive Order seeks to punish a law firm for its zealous and successful \nrepresentations of the President’s political opponents by bullying clients into taking their business \nelsewhere and ultimately forcing the entire Firm into collapse.  It presages the next step, which is \nto intimidate other law firms from representing clients who would challenge Administration poli-\ncies.  No President, regardless of party, is authorized to exercise such power. The Court should \ngrant a temporary order restraining implementation of at least Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Order. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Perkins Coie’s History of Advocating for Its Clients  \nPerkins Coie is one of the largest full-service law firms in the United States.  It employs \nmore than 1,200 lawyers in offices around the world, and another approximately 1,200 business \nprofessionals.  Burman Decl. ¶ 7.  Perkins Coie’s attorneys include military veterans, former pros-\necutors, and public servants.  Id. ¶¶ 4, 7.  They serve on hundreds of boards of civic organizations, \nranging from art museums and food kitchens to major universities and local schools.  Id. ¶ 7.  Its \nlawyers hold political views across the spectrum.  Many attorneys joined the Firm after govern-\nment service in both Democratic and Republican administrations, or after serving as judges or law \nclerks to judges appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents.  Id. ¶ 8.  Reflecting this \nbipartisan ethos, four Perkins Coie partners have recently been appointed as federal judges: two \nby President Trump and two by President Biden.  Id. \nPerkins Coie is dedicated to serving its clients, communities, and employees.  Over its 113-\nyear history, its lawyers have represented clients in every state, in federal and state courts across \nthe nation (including the Supreme Court), and in tribunals worldwide.  Id. ¶ 5.  The Firm and its \nlawyers are regularly recognized for excellence.  Id. ¶ 6.  Perkins Coie has a longstanding, firmwide \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 16 of 57\n \ncommitment to pro bono service.  Id. ¶ 9.  Its lawyers have provided nearly one and a half million \nhours of pro bono service to countless clients, including the League of Women Voters and other \nnon-partisan organizations, and including indigent criminal defendants in the federal courts.  Id.   \nAs a full-service law firm that represents clients in all sectors of the economy, Perkins Coie \nroutinely interacts with the federal government and its employees on behalf of the Firm’s clients \nin innumerable ways.  Id. ¶ 11.  The Firm has nearly 1,000 active matters that require its lawyers \nto interact with more than 90 federal agencies.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 19.  Many of its clients are government \ncontractors who have hired Perkins Coie for legal services having nothing to do with those gov-\nernment contracts.  Id. ¶ 14; see also infra pp.7-9, 33-34, 38, 41-42.    \nB.  The Executive Order and Accompanying “Fact Sheet” \nOn March 6, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14230 titled “Addressing \nRisks From Perkins Coie LLP.”  Ex. 1 (hereinafter “Executive Order” or “EO”).1  Section 1 de-\nclares that Perkins Coie has engaged in “dishonest and dangerous activity” “for decades.”  Id. § 1.  \nAs purported examples of such “dishonest and dangerous activity,” the Order cites the Firm’s \nrepresentation of the President’s opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, and its retention \nof an investigative firm, Fusion GPS, as part of that representation.  Id.  As a further example of \nalleged “dishonest and dangerous activity,” the Order asserts that the Firm has worked with “ac-\ntivist donors” to “judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election \nlaws.”  Id. \nThe Executive Order’s assertions that Perkins Coie’s employees present active “risk[s]” \nare preposterous.  The Order fails to mention that the lawyer who led the representation of the \n2016 Clinton presidential campaign is no longer employed by Perkins Coie and has not been for \n                                                 \n1 Exhibits are attached to the Declaration of Christopher N. Manning, filed herewith.   \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 17 of 57\n \nyears.  Burman Decl. ¶ 12.  Nor does the Order mention that, in the litigation matters it decries, \nthe Firm’s clients prevailed against all but one of dozens of challenges brought by the Trump \ncampaign seeking to overturn the 2020 election results, or that the Firm’s clients also prevailed in \na significant number of voting rights cases, including cases where its clients were successful in \ndefending existing laws.  Id. ¶ 21.  The Order also omits that, before President Trump’s reelection, \na federal court in Florida dismissed with prejudice his personal lawsuit against Perkins Coie alleg-\ning that the Firm had conspired with the Clinton campaign and others to weave a false narrative \nabout Mr. Trump’s colluding with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election.  Id. ¶ 22.   \nSection 1 asserts that one court sanctioned Perkins Coie attorneys for a “lack of candor.”  \nEO § 1.  The Order does not mention that the incident occurred in 2021; that the total sanction was \n$8,700; that the three sanctioned attorneys are no longer partners or employees of the Firm; that \nwhat the court determined to be a lack of candor was a failure to notify the court that a motion to \nsupplement the record was “nearly identical” to an earlier motion filed when the attorneys had \nsought an emergency stay; and that, upon reconsideration, the court explained that a violation of \nthe local rules, without any need to find bad faith, supported the sanctions.  Burman Decl. ¶ 37(c). \nWith the Executive Order, the White House issued a so-called “Fact Sheet.”  Ex. 2.  The \nFact Sheet attempts to justify the Order by falsely stating that the Firm “pushed debunked claims \nof secret Trump-Russia communications via Alfa Bank” which resulted in former Perkins Coie \nattorney Michael Sussmann’s being “indicted for lying to the FBI.”  Id. at 2.  The Fact Sheet does \nnot mention that a jury in this Court acquitted Mr. Sussmann after just two hours of deliberation \nor that Mr. Sussmann left Perkins Coie in 2021.  Burman Decl. ¶ 37(a).   \nThe Fact Sheet states that Perkins Coie “has filed lawsuits against the Trump Administra-\ntion, including one designed to reduce military readiness.”  Fact Sheet at 2.  That appears to refer \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 18 of 57\n \nto a pending lawsuit by servicemembers, represented by Perkins Coie, challenging the Executive \nOrder banning transgender personnel from military service.  Burman Decl. ¶ 37(g); see Shilling v. \nTrump, Case No. 2:25-cv-00241 (W.D. Wash., filed Feb. 6, 2025).   \nC.  The Order Is Already Inflicting Irreparable Harm \nThe Executive Order does more than disparage Perkins Coie.  It also punishes the Firm \nwith nothing less than existential sanctions.  As relevant to this Motion, Section 3 directs govern-\nment agencies to “require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins \nCoie and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract.”  EO § 3.  The \nsection further directs agencies to “take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maxi-\nmum extent permitted by applicable law, … for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any \nservice”; to “otherwise align their agency funding decisions” with the Administration’s goals, es-\npecially those in the Executive Order itself; and to submit an “assessment of contracts with Perkins \nCoie or with entities that do business with Perkins Coie” and “any actions taken with respect to \nthose contracts.”  Id.  The accompanying Fact Sheet makes clear that contracts with Perkins Coie’s \nclients will, in fact, be terminated: “[T]he Federal Government will prohibit funding contractors \nthat use Perkins Coie LLP,” and will do so “[t]o ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors \nwhose earnings subsidize partisan lawsuits against the United States.”  Fact Sheet at 1. \nMany of the Firm’s largest clients (for instance, all of the top 15 largest clients, represent-\ning more than $343 million in 2024 revenue), or their affiliates, have or compete for government \ncontracts, and the Firm represents many of those clients in legal matters completely unrelated to \ngovernment contracting.  Burman Decl. ¶¶ 14, 28.  Each of Perkins Coie’s nine major practice \ngroups includes a substantial percentage of clients that do business with the government.  Id. ¶ 12.  \nFor some, the fact that the Firm gives them legal advice is not public.  Id. ¶ 28.  Accordingly, if \nimplemented, the Order will require these clients to divulge to the government confidential \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 19 of 57\n \ninformation regarding their consultation with counsel, after which the Administration has been \ninstructed to terminate their government contracts.  Id. \nSection 5 directs the heads of “all agencies” to limit the access of Firm attorneys and em-\nployees to federal buildings when access would be “inconsistent with the interests of the United \nStates” and to limit government employees “from engaging with Perkins Coie employees.”  EO \n§ 5.  It directs agency officials to “refrain from hiring employees of Perkins Coie” absent a waiver \ncertifying that “such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States.”  Id.  \nGovernment officers already have begun implementing Section 5.  The day the Order was \nreleased, the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice cited the Order as necessitating post-\nponement of a meeting that was to include a Perkins Coie attorney representing a criminal \ndefendant.  Burman Decl. ¶ 26.  The Criminal Division was unable to advise whether that meeting \nwould ever be rescheduled, threatening that client’s ability to achieve a swift resolution of the \nmatter.  Id.  The next day, an official at a federal agency informed a Firm client that Perkins Coie \nlawyers should not attend a meeting at that agency to discuss their legal matter.  Id. ¶ 25.   \nThe Order’s branding of Perkins Coie as persona non grata has caused reputational and \nfinancial harm that, if allowed to stand, jeopardizes the very existence of the Firm.  In the days \nimmediately after the Order was issued, multiple clients terminated engagements with Perkins \nCoie as a result of the Order, citing their need to be represented by lawyers with whom federal \nagencies will engage.  Burman Decl. ¶ 29(a)-(h).  These immediate and irreparable injuries will \ncontinue to grow by the day given the nature of Perkins Coie’s ongoing legal work and client \nroster.  A critical mass of key clients sit on a precipice:  continued refusals by federal officials to \nmeet with Perkins Coie lawyers, or refusals to permit Firm lawyers to access federal agencies and \nbuildings, would devastate both the Firm as a whole and its zealous pursuit of its clients’ interests.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 20 of 57\n \nBurman Decl. ¶ 30.  The consequences could be catastrophic: if enough of the firm’s largest clients \nleave to protect their government contracts, then the firm could suffer an existential financial crisis. \nBy punishing a law firm for its advocacy on behalf of clients whom the President disfavors, \nthe Executive Order is designed to have a chilling effect extending far beyond Perkins Coie.  Dis-\ntinguished experts on the legal profession and on lawyers’ professional responsibilities—three of \nwhose declarations are included with this filing—agree that the Order presents a clear and present \ndanger to the administration of justice in the United States.  As those experts explain, “[t]he quality \nof justice in the United States depends in large measure on lawyers’ diligent advocacy of their \nclients’ respective positions,” especially for people “whose cause is controversial or the subject of \npopular disapproval.”  Hirshon Decl. ¶¶ 6-7 (quoting D.C. R. Prof’l C. r. 1.3, Comment [2]).  That \nis why the Rules of Professional Conduct underscore “the importance of affording legal assistance \nto unpopular clients.”  Green Decl. at 4.  Yet “[r]easonable lawyers will understand the Executive \nOrder to mean not only that lawyers may suffer government retribution for representing clients in \nmatters of which the President disapproves for personal or political reasons, but also that they may \nbe punished for representing clients who challenge the legality of government policies.”  Hirshon \nDecl. ¶ 10; see also Green Decl. at 5 (opining that the Order “will discourage not only Perkins \nCoie but also other law firms from representing future clients and pursuing future actions, and \nparticularly actions against the Government and other advocacy that the President might disfa-\nvor”).  Moreover, the Order deters clients from exercising their Constitutional right to select the \ncounsel of their choosing, and would even deter law school graduates from choosing employment \nat law firms that represent clients the President dislikes.  Hirshon Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.  \nD.  The Executive Order Is Politically Motivated Retribution  \nObservers immediately understood that the Executive Order and Fact Sheet are retaliation \nfor Perkins Coie’s representation of the President’s opponents in the 2016 and 2020 elections and \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 21 of 57\n \nof clients who have successfully challenged the President and his allies in court.  The Associated \nPress wrote that “the actions appear designed not only to settle scores from years past but also to \ndeter both government officials and private sector workers from participating in new inquiries into \nhis conduct.”  Ex. 3.  The New York Times recognized the Order as an “escalation of efforts to \npunish groups the President sees as aiding his enemies.”  Ex. 4. \nThe Order immediately had its intended chilling effect.  The Wall Street Journal reported \nthat law firms are “fearful of taking on a president who hasn’t shied away from punishing his \nenemies,” citing “private conversations” with “partners at … leading law firms” who have declined \nto act “in part because of retaliation fears.”  Ex. 5.; see also id. (“Advocacy groups … say it has \nbeen more difficult to recruit larger firms to help with cases against Trump ….”); id. (quoting \nNAACP Legal Defense Fund employee: “Law firms are not as vocal and as zealous”).   \nThe press and the public rightly recognized the Order as retaliatory because the President \nrepeatedly promised during his 2024 campaign to retaliate against his perceived political oppo-\nnents and the lawyers who represented them.  In a June 2024 interview, for example, the President \nsaid, “Look, when this election is over, based on what they’ve done, I would have every right to \ngo after them ….”  Ex. 6.  In September 2024, Mr. Trump warned on Truth Social that “WHEN I \nWIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.  … Please \nbeware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers ….”  Ex. 7.  Since issuing the Order, the Pres-\nident has reiterated his intention to punish firms that represent his perceived political enemies, \nstating: “We have a lot of law firms that we are going to be going after.”  Ex. 5.    \nLEGAL STANDARD AND REVIEWABLITY \nFor the reasons discussed below, Perkins Coie is entitled to a temporary restraining order \nenjoining implementation of at least Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Executive Order.  “An application \nfor a TRO is analyzed using the same factors applicable to a request for preliminary injunctive \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 22 of 57\n \nrelief.”  Harris v. Bessent, 2025 WL 521027, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025).  To obtain such relief, \na plaintiff must show “(1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (cleaned up).  Where “the movant seeks to enjoin the government, the final two \nTRO factors … merge.”  D.A.M. v. Barr, 474 F. Supp. 3d 45, 67 (D.D.C. 2020).  \nThere is “no question” that a district court “may review the constitutionality of [an] Exec-\nutive Order and grant injunctive relief.”  CASA, Inc. v. Trump, 2025 WL 408636, at *1, *4 (D. Md. \nFeb. 5, 2025).  Indeed, this Court recently has enjoined implementation of Executive Orders that \nexceed the President’s statutory or constitutional authority.  See, e.g., Doctors for Am. v. Off. of \nPers. Mgmt., 2025 WL 452707, at *10 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025) (granting TRO to prevent agencies \nfrom removing or modifying health-related websites pursuant to executive order); Jones v. Trump, \n1:25-cv-00401, Dkt. 28 (D.D.C. Feb. 24, 2025) (granting TRO to prevent implementation of ex-\necutive order regarding transgender inmates “as to the plaintiff”); see also Doe v. McHenry, 1:25-\ncv-00286, Dkt. 44 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025) (granting preliminary injunction of same order).   \nThe Executive Order is immediately reviewable.  As discussed above, the Order already is \nbeing implemented, and the Firm already is feeling its “effects” in a “concrete way.”  Nat’l Park \nHosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-08 (2003).  The issues raised in this motion \nare thus “fit[] … for judicial decision” now.  Saline Parents v. Garland, 88 F.4th 298, 306 (D.C. \nCir. 2023); see Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 162 (2014) (permitting review \nwhere plaintiff’s conduct was “arguably proscribed” by law); Cooksey v. Futrell, 721 F.3d 226, \n240 (4th Cir. 2013) (First Amendment rights “are particularly apt to be found ripe for immediate \nprotection”).  Moreover, “the hardship” to Perkins Coie of “withholding court consideration” until \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 23 of 57\n \nsome later date would be immense.  Saline Parents, 88 F.4th at 306.  This case is not “dependent \non contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,” \nTrump v. New York, 592 U.S. 125, 131 (2020) (cleaned up)—the harm is unfolding in real time.   \nThe Order’s boilerplate language that it should be implemented “consistent with applicable \nlaw” is no barrier to review.  As other courts have explained, such savings clauses in an executive \norder “cannot be given effect when the Court, by rescuing the constitutionality of a measure, would \noverride clear and specific language” that violates the Constitution.  City of San Francisco v. \nTrump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1239 (9th Cir. 2018) (challenge to executive order justiciable).  Here, the \nOrder “unambiguously commands action” that is plainly unconstitutional and already being im-\nplemented to Perkins Coie’s detriment.  Id. at 1240.  Permitting an order that distorts the law and \nexceeds the President’s authority based on a “consistent with applicable law” carveout would cre-\nate an “intellectual cul-de-sac” and render “judicial review… a meaningless exercise.”  Id.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  PERKINS COIE IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS  \nA.  The Executive Order Exceeds the President’s Constitutional Authority and \nViolates the Separation of Powers \nPerkins Coie will succeed on its claim that Sections 1, 3 and 5 of the Executive Order \nexceed the President’s constitutional authority and violate the separation of powers.  The President \nhas no freestanding authority to regulate private parties, find facts, or impose punishments.  Be-\ncause the Founders feared “unlimited executive power” and the “abuses and usurpations” of the \nKing of England, they divided and limited governmental authority.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. \nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 641 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); Decl. of Indep. para. 2 (U.S. 1776).  \nThe President’s “executive Power” is paired with his obligation to “take Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, §§ 1, 3.  In other words, his actions must be authorized \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 24 of 57\n \nby the Constitution or by statute.  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585.  The President, moreover, cannot \nexercise his authority in a way that infringes on the authority of the other two branches.  Id. at 587.  \nDoing so would upend the separation of powers, which “protects the liberty of the individual from \narbitrary power.”  Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011).   \nThe Order—which sanctions a law firm in retaliation for representing clients whom the \nPresident views as political opponents—(1) is divorced from any statutory or constitutional source \nof executive power, and (2) invades the judiciary’s constitutional authority.   \n1.  No Statutory or Constitutional Authority Supports the Order \nFirst, it is “black letter law” that the President’s power to issue an executive order “‘must \nstem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.’”  Minnesota v. Mille Lacs \nBand of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 188-89 (1999) (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585).  \nCourts have not hesitated to hold that an executive order with “no express constitutional or statu-\ntory authorization” lacks legal effect.  Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 316 U.S. 317, 331 \n(1942).  For example, in Mille Lacs Band, the Supreme Court held that an executive order was \n“ineffective to terminate” tribal rights because the President had “no statutory or constitutional \nauthority” to issue a key provision of the order.  526 U.S. at 193-95.  Likewise, district courts have \nenjoined executive orders for their lack of any statutory or constitutional authority.2  Indeed, even \nwhen Presidents have cited statutes, courts have struck down orders that went beyond those stat-\nutes’ explicit authority.3  In contrast, when courts have upheld executive orders, they have found \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Doe v. Trump, 2025 WL 485070, at *1, *16-17 (D. Mass. Feb. 13, 2025) (executive \norder on birthright citizenship); CASA, Inc., 2025 WL 408636, at *4 (same); PFLAG, Inc. v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 685124, at *24 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025) (executive order conditioning federal \nfunding for medical institutions on denying gender-affirming care). \n3 See, e.g., Nebraska v. Su, 121 F.4th 1, 7-9 (9th Cir. 2024) (statute did not authorize executive \norder and implementing rule to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors); Kentucky v. \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 25 of 57\n \nan explicit constitutional or statutory basis for the President’s authority.  For example, the Supreme \nCourt upheld President Trump’s “travel ban” because the Immigration and Nationality Act estab-\nlished “grounds on which an alien abroad may be inadmissible to the United States” and “delegated \nto the President authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens in certain circumstances.”  Trump \nv. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 683 (2018). \nHere, the President does not identify any statutory basis for making the findings in Section \n1 or imposing the punishments in Sections 3 and 5.  Nor could he: no statute authorizes the Presi-\ndent or his executive officers to sanction a law firm for its general representation of clients.  The \nPresident thus is exacting retribution against a law firm for representing his political opponents \nwithout even an indication of statutory authority.  Put differently, “[t]he President’s order does not \ndirect that a congressional policy be executed in a manner prescribed by Congress—it [improperly] \ndirects that a presidential policy be executed in a manner prescribed by the President.”  Youngs-\ntown, 343 U.S. at 588 (emphasis added).  In short, there is no “nexus between the” President’s \naction “and some delegation of the requisite legislative authority by Congress.”  Chrysler Corp. v. \nBrown, 441 U.S. 281, 304 (1979). \nLacking any statutory basis, the Order could survive only if supported by some inherent \nexecutive power.  None applies here.  Again, the design and effect of the Order is to sanction an \nentire law firm because of the alleged conduct of some of its lawyers in representing the President’s \npolitical adversaries years ago.  That is not an enumerated Article II power, nor is it a foreign-\naffairs power of the type that inheres in the nature of “executive Power.”  See, e.g., Seila Law LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 213 (2020); Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 32 (2015).  \n                                                 \nBiden, 23 F.4th 585, 589, 606 (6th Cir. 2022) (statute did not support vaccine mandate for federal \ncontractors); Georgia v. President of the U.S., 46 F.4th 1283, 1298 (11th Cir. 2022) (same).   \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 26 of 57\n \nNeither is it consistent with “executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress \nand never before questioned,” that helps define the limits of presidential power.  See Youngstown, \n343 U.S. at 610 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); accord United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. \n459, 473-74 (1915).   \nInstead, as discussed below, the power to sanction lawyers for professional misconduct \nrests with the judicial branch.  As Prof. Green of Fordham Law School explains, the “Order is \ninconsistent with, and interferes with, settled understandings of the separation of powers and, in \nparticular, judicial regulation of the legal profession.”  Green Decl. at 1.  The Order’s “form of \nregulation by presidential whim … threatens to undermine the judicial regulation that requires \nlawyers to represent clients zealously and not to subordinate clients’ interests to lawyers’ own self-\ninterest.”  Id. at 6 (emphasis added).  Indeed, the Executive Branch could not fairly discipline \nlawyers who represent clients in opposition to prosecutors, executive officials, and agencies.  Id. \nat 3.  Although the Executive plays a role in effectuating the judiciary’s judgments, the President \ncannot render and execute his own judgments, just as he cannot unilaterally make and enforce his \nown laws.  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 587.  In no sense is punishing lawyers for their representation \nof clients among the President’s “core constitutional powers” or even within the “outer perimeter” \nof those powers.  Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 614, 642 (2024). \n2.  The Executive Order Improperly Usurps Judicial Power \nIn addition to lacking any statutory or constitutional basis, the Executive Order tramples \nthe separation of powers by asserting fundamentally judicial authority.  “If there is a principle in \nour Constitution … more sacred than another, it is that which separates the legislative, executive \nand judicial powers.”  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 116 (1926) (cleaned up).  The power \nto sanction attorneys for their conduct in representing clients always has belonged to the judiciary.  \nThe President’s order transparently usurps that authority, without any of the procedural protections \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 27 of 57\n \naccompanying the judicial process. \nThe power to sanction lawyers for their professional conduct has always been held by \njudges.  Federal and state courts have residual, inherent powers to regulate the practice of law.  See \nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991).  In federal court, “[t]hat authority includes the \nability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.”  Good-\nyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger, 581 U.S. 101, 107 (2017) (cleaned up).  State courts (and state \nbars under delegated authority) also determine whether lawyers have complied with their profes-\nsional obligations.  See, e.g., Kohn v. State Bar, 87 F.4th 1021, 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2024) (en banc).  \nLegislatures too can regulate the practice of law by enacting rules of conduct, but the authority to \nimpose sanctions for violating those rules rests with the judiciary.  Just as a legislature cannot \nintrude upon the judicial power, see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803), the \nPresident cannot arrogate to himself powers traditionally exercised by other branches.  Nor may \nthe President assume powers traditionally held by states.  Cf. Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, \n857 (2014) (federal statutes presumed not to intrude upon traditional areas of state authority).   \n  More broadly, the Order unlawfully exercises judicial power by making factual findings \nthat the Firm engaged in purported misconduct and then punishing the Firm based on those find-\nings.  In cases involving private rights of liberty, property, and contract, the Judiciary—not the \nExecutive—makes those determinations.  See Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 54-\n56 (1989); see also United States v. Bear, 769 F.3d 1221, 1230 (10th Cir. 2014); cf. SEC v. Jarkesy, \n603 U.S. 109, 140 (2024) (the Constitution prohibits the “concentrat[ion of] the roles of prosecutor, \njudge, and jury in the hands of the Executive Branch”).  In Section 1 of the Order, however, the \nPresident makes various (false or misleading) findings about the Firm’s representation of the Pres-\nident’s 2016 opponent and other clients, as well as its advocacy and hiring practices.  And in \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 28 of 57\n \nSections 3 and 5, the President purports to penalize that conduct by, among other things, forcing \nthe Firm’s clients to disclose their attorney-client relationships with the Firm, stripping those cli-\nents of their government contracts, limiting the Firm’s access to government buildings and ability \nto interact with government personnel to practice law, and presumptively barring Firm employees \nfrom government employment. \nThe Executive Order does all this in a way that the judiciary could not—by pronouncing \njudgment without any notice, opportunity to be heard, or neutral evaluation of the evidence.  In \nJoint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 126 (1951), the Supreme Court \ncondemned the notion that the Attorney General could lawfully designate groups as “subversive” \n“without notice, … without opportunity to meet the undisclosed evidence[,] … and without op-\nportunity” to object.  Id. at 161 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  Yet that is precisely what the \nExecutive Order does.  The President’s order is thus a stunning combination of (1) an adjudication \nof facts to support a restriction of private rights and (2) no process whatsoever.4  The Executive \nfinds the facts he deems impermissible and pronounces them, full stop. \nThe Executive Order’s invasion of the judicial function is clear from the fact that the federal \ncourts already have adjudicated the President’s grievances referenced in the Order.  For example, \nthe Fifth Circuit (after a hearing) already ruled upon the alleged “lack of candor” referenced in the \nExecutive Order.  See Tex. All. for Retired Ams. v. Hughs, No. 20-40643 (5th Cir.).  A federal court \nalready heard (and a jury acquitted) former Perkins Coie partner Michael Sussmann for allegedly \nlying to the FBI.  See United States v. Sussmann, No. 1:21-cr-582 (D.D.C.).  And a federal court \nalready dismissed a civil suit brought by Mr. Trump in his personal capacity against the Firm and \n                                                 \n4 Worse still, the Order seeks to punish the Firm for its (successful) courtroom advocacy in elec-\ntion-related matters, advocacy which was protected at common law by “absolute privilege.”  \nOparaugo v. Watts, 884 A.2d 63, 79 (D.C. 2005). \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 29 of 57\n \nothers.  See, e.g., Trump v. Clinton, 626 F. Supp. 3d 1264 (S.D. Fla. 2022) (appeal pending).  Ap-\nparently  dissatisfied  with  these  court  rulings  and  with  the  due  process  enshrined  in  the \nConstitution, the President takes matters into his own hands.  The Constitution forbids this. \nIndeed, the President’s purported “Executive Order” amounts to the equivalent of a bill of \nattainder.  Under Article I, Congress may not enact “bills of attainder,” acts by which Parliament \n“named” a particular individual “considered disloyal to the … State” and unilaterally imposed a \n“wide array of punishments,” including “the punitive confiscation of property.”  Nixon v. Adm’r \nof Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 473-74 (1977); see also U.S. Const. art. I, § 9.  The prohibition on \nsuch acts was “an important ingredient of the doctrine of ‘separation of powers,’ one of the organ-\nizing principles of our system of government[,] … [and] an important ‘bulwark against tyranny.’”  \nNixon, 433 U.S. at 469-71 (quoting United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 442-43 (1965)).  In \nessence, that prohibition prevents Congress from usurping the judiciary’s power to impose pun-\nishments that deprive individuals of private rights.   \nThe Executive Order shares the essential features of a bill of attainder: it is a “special” act \n“prescribing punishment, without a trial, for a specific person or group.”  Bill of Attainder, Black’s \nLaw Dictionary (12th ed. 2024).  To be sure, the Bill of Attainder Clause, by its terms, does not \napply to the Executive Branch.  See Korte v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 797 F.2d 967, 972 (Fed. Cir. \n1986).  But the fact that the Executive Order is indistinguishable from a bill of attainder under-\nscores its unconstitutionality.  Just as Congress may not usurp the judicial role by passing \nlegislation depriving individuals of private rights, neither may the President do so through execu-\ntive fiat.  See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm., 341 U.S. at 144 (Black, J., concurring).  Indeed, \nthe President has significantly less authority to announce new measures as compared to Congress’s \npower to enact legislation.  See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 482, 503 (2023).  Yet the President \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 30 of 57\n \nhas taken it upon himself to “pronounce[] upon the guilt of [Perkins Coie] … in accordance [solely] \nwith [the President’s] own notions.”  Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 323 (1866).  \nPresidents have no such power in a system where “separating and dividing the powers of govern-\nment … was to diffuse power the better to secure liberty.”  See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, \n721 (1986) (cleaned up). \n  To be clear, these flaws in the Executive Order are not about which person or party controls \nthe White House.  Regardless of who fills the office of President, this Court has an obligation to \npreserve the separation of powers and the individual liberty it was designed to protect.  Because \nSections 1, 3, and 5 of the Executive Order have no basis in any statute or the Constitution itself, \nthis Court should enter a TRO enjoining their implementation.   \nB.  The Executive Order Violates the First Amendment \nPerkins Coie also will succeed in demonstrating that the Executive Order violates the First \nAmendment by (1) retaliating against the Firm and its clients for their actual and perceived exercise \nof speech and associational rights and (2) discriminating against the Firm on the basis of viewpoint. \nAs is well known, the President filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the \n2020 election.  Perkins Coie successfully defended many of those lawsuits—prevailing in all but \none.  In response, the President publicly and repeatedly stated his intention, if re-elected, to retal-\niate against those who opposed his election claims, including the lawyers who represented those \npersons.  He made that threat early and often during the 2024 campaign, for example telling his \nnearly four million Truth Social followers, “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. … [T]his legal exposure extends to Lawyers.”  Ex. 7.  \nThe Order fulfills that repeated threat. \nThe Order openly targets the Firm, branding it as a “partisan actor” and charging it with “a \npattern” of “egregious activity,” such as bringing “partisan lawsuits,” associating with “activist \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 31 of 57\n \ndonors,” and seeking “to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted elec-\ntion laws.”  And it punishes Perkins Coie and its clients for these perceived transgressions by \nordering agencies to, among other things, (i) deny all Firm employees access to federal buildings \nand engagement with federal employees and (ii) terminate government contracts with any firm \nclients.  Such clear retaliation against the Firm and its clients violates the First Amendment. \n1.  The Executive Order Retaliates in Violation of the First Amendment \nThe First Amendment “prohibits government officials from subjecting individuals to ‘re-\ntaliatory actions’ after the fact for having engaged in protected speech.”  Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys. v. \nWilson, 595 U.S. 468, 474 (2022) (quoting Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S. 391, 398 (2019)) (cleaned \nup).  That principle applies just as strongly when the government’s “retaliatory response” is based \nnot upon a person’s own speech, but the speech of “a person in a close relationship with the plain-\ntiff, and the government retaliated against the plaintiff for [its] perceived association with the other \nperson and that person’s speech.”  Lewis v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 922 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1302 \n(M.D. Ala. 2012) (collecting cases); see also Hughes v. City of New York, 680 F. App’x 8, 10 (2d \nCir. 2017) (summary order) (retaliating based on “‘perceived’ association” violates First Amend-\nment); Turner v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, 502 F. Supp. 3d 333, 381 (D.D.C. 2020) (retaliating \n“on the basis of perceived viewpoint” violates First Amendment); see generally Heffernan v. City \nof Paterson, N.J., 578 U.S. 266, 272-73 (2016).   \nThe Executive Order retaliates against the Firm and its clients for the Firm’s own speech, \nfor association with clients and their speech, and for the clients’ speech.  The Order does not stop \nat simply criticizing Perkins Coie for its allegedly “partisan” speech and associational activity in \nthe public square; it imposes draconian punishments.  Such reprisal clearly violates the First \nAmendment.  Like the compilation and publication of enemies lists in the McCarthy era, the Order \n“smacks of a most evil type of censorship” and “cannot be reconciled with the First Amendment.”  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 32 of 57\n \nJoint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm., 341 U.S. at 143-44 (Black, J., concurring).  Where, as here, \nretaliation against a disfavored viewpoint is the motive, that ends the inquiry.  See Perry v. Sin-\ndermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597-98 (1972); Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, \n2025 WL 573764, at *15 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025). \n  The Order’s retaliatory motive is reflected in its stunning breadth.  First, the sanctions \napply to every one of the more than 2,400 lawyers and employees of Perkins Coie—both now and \ngoing forward—even though the lawyers who led the alleged “partisan” speech and activity have \nnot worked at the Firm for years.  The President therefore does not justify the Order based on a \ndesire to address “[r]isks” associated with particular persons responsible for particular conduct; \ninstead, the Order collectively punishes Perkins Coie employees for the Firm’s past association \nwith lawyers who have left the Firm.  Second, the sanctions apply even though the speech and \nactivity occurred years ago, almost a decade ago in the case of the 2016 campaign, and more than \nfour years ago in the case of challenges to the 2020 election results.  Third, the sanctions apply to \npersons who are not lawyers.  Section 5 directs agency officials to “refrain from hiring employees \nof Perkins Coie” to the extent permitted by law—a provision that applies to secretaries, IT spe-\ncialists, docketing clerks, and every one of the Firm’s other approximately 1,200 non-lawyer \npersonnel.  And Section 3 threatens severe sanctions for another category of non-lawyers—clients \nof the Firm.  See Sec’y of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 955-58 (1984) \n(“when there is a danger of chilling free speech,” aligned third parties with injuries have standing \nto raise challenges); see also U.S. Dep’t of Lab. v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720 (1990) (applying to \nlawyers).  As the Fact Sheet states bluntly, “To ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors \nwhose earnings subsidize partisan lawsuits against the United States, the Federal Government will \nprohibit funding contractors that use Perkins Coie LLP.”  Fact Sheet ¶ 1. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 33 of 57\n \n2.  The Executive Order Constitutes Viewpoint Discrimination \nEven if the Executive Order did not reek of retaliatory motive, it still would violate the \nFirst Amendment because it discriminates against Perkins Coie for its expressive and associative \nactivities and those of its clients.  The Order complains of the clients the Firm has taken (including \nHillary Clinton); the consultants it has retained (including Fusion GPS); the persons who have \nfunded allegedly “partisan” lawsuits (including “activist donors [such as] George Soros”); and the \nlegal positions the Firm has advocated (including the alleged “judicial[] overturn[ing] of popular, \nnecessary, and democratically enacted election laws”).  The Fact Sheet decries that “Perkins Coie \nLLP has filed lawsuits against the Trump Administration,” and, more specifically, that it filed a \nlawsuit “designed to reduce military readiness,” Fact Sheet ¶ 2—a misdescription of a case brought \nby Firm clients challenging an Executive Order that would discharge transgender military person-\nnel.  In doing so, the Order and Fact Sheet attribute to the Firm the speech and views of its clients, \nconsultants, and associates, and then punish the Firm and other clients for those viewpoints. \nSuch speaker- and viewpoint-based sanctions constitute a “blatant and egregious form of \ncontent discrimination” subject to strict scrutiny.  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 168-71 \n(2015) (quoting Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995)).  \nWhere government regulation is viewpoint discriminatory, that “is ‘all but dispositive’ in a First \nAmendment challenge.”  Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers, 2025 WL 573764, at *15 (quoting Sor-\nrell  v.  IMS  Health  Inc.,  564  U.S.  552,  571  (2011)).    It  is  dispositive  because  “viewpoint \ndiscrimination is uniquely harmful to a free and democratic society.”  Nat’l Rifle Ass’n v. Vullo, \n602 U.S. 175, 187 (2024).  That principle dooms the Order because, as the Supreme Court under-\nscored in Vullo, “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from relying on ‘the threat \nof invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion … to achieve the suppression’ of disfa-\nvored speech.”  Id. at 176 (emphasis added). \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 34 of 57\n \nViewpoint discrimination is particularly egregious when it involves political speech, par-\nticularly speech about the rules that govern democratic elections, or when speech involves the \npresentation to the courts of reasonable legal arguments.  As the Supreme Court explained in Legal \nServices Corp. v. Velazquez, which concerned regulations purporting to prevent Legal Services \nlawyers from challenging welfare laws, attempts to “draw lines around” those arguments that the \ngovernment “finds unacceptable but which by their nature are within the province of the courts to \nconsider” violate the First Amendment.  531 U.S. 533, 546, 548-49 (2001).  That the Order targets \na law firm for its clients’ legitimate use of the courts makes it all the more obviously unconstitu-\ntional: The President simply does not like the results of judicial decisions won by the Firm’s clients \nwith the Firm’s assistance. \nStrict scrutiny requires the government to prove that the Order “furthers a compelling in-\nterest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.”  Reed, 576 U.S. at 171 (cleaned up).  The \ngovernment cannot come close to meeting that demanding test for the simple reason that purport-\nedly “partisan” speech and litigation by a handful of attorneys who no longer work for Perkins \nCoie cannot justify punishing the entire firm, including all its non-lawyer employees, and its many \nclients that have government contracts.  Nor can the government show a compelling interest when \nthe legal authority for sanctioning alleged professional misconduct resides with the judicial branch, \nnot the executive.  Supra pp.15-16.5  To the extent the President disagrees with the legal positions \nadvanced by Perkins Coie, he has already sought redress in the proper forum—the courts—and \nlost.  Trump, 626 F. Supp. 3d 1264 (appeal pending). \nFor the same reasons, the Order is not narrowly tailored: it lacks any “precision of \n                                                 \n5 The former Perkins Coie lawyers whom the Order refers to as displaying a “lack of candor before \nthe court,” EO § 1, already have been sanctioned in the courts, Tex. All. for Retired Ams. v. Hughs, \nNo. 20-40643 (5th Cir. Jun. 30, 2021), Dkt. No. 127-1. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 35 of 57\n \nregulation,” a fatal defect when “political expression or association is at issue.”  In re Primus, 436 \nU.S. 412, 434 (1978).  The Order, for example, threatens the termination of all government con-\ntracts held by any clients of Perkins Coie, where the only rationale for this far-reaching and drastic \npunishment is that government payments to contractors may “subsidize partisan lawsuits.”  Fact \nSheet ¶ 1.  And there is no narrow tailoring in Section 5, which calls for “limiting Government \nemployees … from engaging with Perkins Coie employees.”  Even if there were a legitimate basis \nfor limiting engagement with those lawyers who “filed lawsuits against the Trump Administra-\ntion,” Fact Sheet ¶ 2, (there is not), there would be no lawful basis, for example, for limiting the \naccess of the Firm’s patent lawyers to the Patent & Trademark Office in the more than 1,000 active \nmatters, Berman Decl. ¶ 15, or limiting the access of any firm lawyer to a federal courthouse or \nadjudicative agency.6  When the government provides a forum, it “ordinarily may not exclude \nspeech or speakers from the forum on the basis of viewpoint,” regardless of the type of forum.  \nE.g., Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829; Lamb’s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 \nU.S. 384, 393-94 (1993).  For all these reasons, the Order violates the First Amendment. \nC.  The Executive Order Violates Perkins Coie’s Right to Due Process \nPerkins Coie also will prevail on its due process claim.  The Due Process Clause guarantees \nthat “no person shall … be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. \nConst. amend. V.  The clause “is implicated” whenever the government imposes “civil penalties.”  \nBMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 574 n.22 (1996) (emphasis omitted).  Executive \nBranch “findings of wrongdoing” that carry legal consequences and “could have an adverse impact \non [an entity’s] reputation” qualify as “sanctions” that trigger the “essential … protection[ ]” of \n                                                 \n6 Barring access to a federal courthouse would be particularly egregious, both because doing so \nwould violate the separation and powers and because the First Amendment right to petition the \ngovernment for redress of grievances guarantees access to the courts.  See, e.g., Borough of Duryea \nv. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 387 (2011). \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 36 of 57\n \n“fair notice.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253, 254, 256 (2012).   \nAt its core, due process mandates that a person facing a government sanction receive both \n“notice of the case against him” and an “opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a \nmeaningful manner.”  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333, 348 (1976) (cleaned up).  Courts \napply a “familiar two-part inquiry:” (1) whether the plaintiff faces a deprivation of a protected \nproperty or liberty interest, and, if so, (2) whether that plaintiff has received the process that is due.  \nLogan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428 (1982).  Under that test, the Firm will succeed \non its due process claim.   \n1.  The Order Deprives Perkins Coie of Liberty and Property Interests  \nProtected “liberty” interests include “not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the \nright of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, … and \ngenerally to enjoy those privileges long recognized as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness.”  \nBd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572 (1972) (cleaned up).  Here, the Order (a) \ndeprives the Firm and its attorneys of the right to follow their chosen profession, (b) harms the \nFirm’s reputation, (c) vitiates the Firm’s right to petition the government; and (d) interferes with \nits constitutionally protected property interests. \na.  The Constitution safeguards the right to “follow a chosen profession free from un-\nreasonable governmental interference.”  Campbell v. District of Columbia, 894 F.3d 281, 288 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (cleaned up); see Schware v. Bd. of Bar Exam., 353 U.S. 232, 238-39 (1957) \n(government “cannot exclude a person from the practice of law or from any other occupation in a \nmanner or for reasons that contravene the [due process clause]”).  That interest is implicated when \ngovernment “direct[ly] and unambiguous[ly]” interferes with a private party’s professional rela-\ntionships.  Mead v. Indep. Ass’n, 684 F.3d 226, 232 (1st Cir. 2012).  The Order does just that.  It \nrequires all federal contractors to disclose “any business they do with Perkins Coie” and then \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 37 of 57\n \norders agency officials to review those contracts and “take appropriate steps to terminate any con-\ntract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.”  EO § 3.  Or, as the Fact Sheet states, \n“the Federal Government will prohibit funding contractors that use [the Firm].”  Fact Sheet at 1.  \nThe stated aim and obvious effect of Section 3 is to force the Firm’s many government-contractor \nclients to end their relationships with the Firm.  Hirshon Decl. ¶ 12.  This pressure on current \nclients to disassociate from the Firm, and on potential clients to avoid associating with the Firm \naltogether, plainly interferes with the Firm’s liberty interest.  Burman Decl. ¶¶ 28-32. \nThe Executive Order also limits the Firm’s and its employees’ liberty to pursue their chosen \nprofession by impairing its ability to provide legal services.  That liberty interest is implicated \nwhenever (1) the government “formally or automatically exclude[s an entity] from some category \nof work,” or (2) where the government’s action has “the broad effect of largely precluding [the \nentity] from pursuing [its] chosen career.”  Campbell, 894 F.3d at 289 (cleaned up); see Kartseva \nv. Dep’t of State, 37 F.3d 1524, 1528 (D.C. Cir. 1994). \nThe Firm satisfies both standards.  As the D.C. Circuit routinely holds, the government \nformally excludes private parties from future work by depriving them of the “right to be considered \nfor government contracts in common with all other persons.”  Gen. Elec. v. Jackson, 610 F.3d 110, \n121 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Doe v. DOJ, 753 F.2d 1092, 1108-09 (D.C. Cir. 1985)); see \nKartseva, 37 F.3d at 1528.  Here, the Order explicitly directs agencies to “terminate” any contract \n“for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service.”  EO § 3(b)(i).   \nIn addition, the obvious purpose and effect is to prevent the Firm’s lawyers from doing the \nwork necessary to provide effective legal representation to clients.  Section 5(a) purports to deny \nthe Firm “access [to] Federal Government buildings,” such as offices of administrative agencies, \nand prevents it from “engaging with” “Governmental employees” such as prosecutors, civil \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 38 of 57\n \nenforcement staff, investigators, and court staff.  EO § 5(a).  Read literally, the Executive Order \nwould even prevent the Firm’s lawyers from attending hearings, arguing motions and appeals, \ntrying cases, appearing before administrative agencies, engaging with regulators, negotiating with \nprosecutors, and resolving cases—in other words, from effectively representing clients in matters \ninvolving the federal government or federal issues.  While the Order cannot constitutionally bar \nthe courthouse door to Perkins Coie lawyers, its sweeping prohibitions at minimum “seriously \naffect” Perkins Coie’s ability to pursue its chosen profession.  See Campbell, 894 F.3d at 289; \nBurman Decl. ¶¶ 11-20, 25-33.  \nb.  The Order and Fact Sheet also deprive the Firm of its liberty interest in its reputa-\ntion.  “Where a person’s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the \ngovernment is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.”  Wisconsin v. \nConstantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437 (1971).  To establish a cognizable reputational interest, Perkins \nCoie need only demonstrate that the government “issues a stigmatizing posting (or designation)” \nthat “deprive[s Perkins Coie] of a right previously held under state law.”  Nat’l Counsel of Re-\nsistance of Iran v. Dep’t of State, 251 F.3d 192, 204 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Paul v. Davis, 424 \nU.S. 693, 708 (1976)).  Thus, the D.C. Circuit has held that plaintiffs’ liberty interests were impli-\ncated when they were designated as “foreign terrorist organizations” and when that designation \ndeprived them of their rights to, inter alia, hold bank accounts.  Id. at 205; Constantineau, 400 \nU.S. at 434, 437 (stigmatizing statements combined with deprivation of right to buy alcohol); Goss \nv. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574-75 (school suspension).  \nThe Order and Fact Sheet besmirch the Firm’s reputation directly and repeatedly.  The \nOrder describes Perkins Coie as “dishonest and dangerous” and levels numerous unfounded alle-\ngations, including that it “manufactured a false ‘dossier’ designed to steal an election,” engaged in \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 39 of 57\n \na “pattern” of “egregious activity,” “undermin[ed] democratic elections” and “integrity of [the] \ncourts, and honest law enforcement,” “racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff,” \n“maintain[s] … discriminatory practices,” and “engage[s] in blatant race-based and sex-based dis-\ncrimination.”  EO § 1.  The Fact Sheet adds that the Administration “will not tolerate [the Firm’s] \nunethical and discriminatory actions.”  Fact Sheet at 1.  The Order also indirectly tarnishes the \nFirm’s reputation by suggesting that it cannot be trusted to enter federal buildings or talk to gov-\nernment employees.  Those same restrictions deny the Firm rights to which it otherwise would be \nentitled, and which every citizen enjoys.  EO §§ 3, 5.  This change in status infringes a cognizable \nliberty interest.  See, e.g., Constantineau, 400 U.S. at 437; Burman Decl. ¶¶ 24-37. \nc.  The Order independently deprives the Firm of its “liberty interest in [its] First \nAmendment right to petition the government.”  Trentadue v. Integrity Comm., 501 F.3d 1215, \n1236-37 (10th Cir. 2007); Arnaud v. Odom, 870 F.2d 304, 311 (5th Cir. 1989); see NAACP v. \nButton, 371 U.S. 415, 429 (1963).  This protected right to petition “extends to all departments of \nthe Government,” including courts.  Cal. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, \n510 (1972); Broudy v. Mather, 460 F.3d 106, 117 & n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  The Order facially \ndeprives that right by purporting to restrict access to courthouses, a clear constitutional violation. \nd.  Finally, the Order injures the Firm’s valuable interests in its contractual relation-\nships with its clients.  “The Supreme Court has recognized that property interests protected by the \nFifth Amendment may be created by virtue of purely private contractual agreements.”  Int’l Union, \nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Auto Glass Emps. Credit Union, \n72 F.3d 1243, 1250 (6th Cir. 1996) (citing, e.g., Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 492 (1959)); \nsee also Stein v. Bd. of N.Y.C. Bureau of Pupil Transp., 792 F.2d 13, 17 (2d Cir. 1986).  As ex-\nplained above, the Order represents an unprecedented effort to undermine the Firm’s client \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 40 of 57\n \nrelationships.  This is an equally significant deprivation of liberty.  \n2.  The Executive Order Was Issued Without Notice or A Hearing \n“[L]aws which regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden \nor required,” Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253, as well as notice of “the severity of the penalty that \n[the government] may impose,” Gore, 517 U.S. at 574.  “This requirement of clarity in regulation \nis essential to the protections provided by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.”  Fox \nTelevision, 567 U.S. at 253.  And to be “constitutionally sufficient,” notice should be provided \n“prior to [a person’s] being sanctioned.”  Id. at 257 (emphasis added).   \nThe Firm was not given prior notice that its conduct would trigger executive sanctions, and \nthe Order does not identify any law that the Firm allegedly violated.  The Firm only learned of the \nOrder’s existence when the President issued it on March 6.  Perkins Coie never received a chance \nto challenge the imposition of sanctions before the Order took effect.  As a result, the Firm was \ndeprived of “an opportunity to speak up in [its] own defense.”  Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81 \n(1972).  It could not rebut the government’s defamatory assertions (such as the claims that the \nFirm “manufactured” false evidence or “engages in blatant discrimination”) or explain why, even \nif any of those false allegations were true, the punishment was inappropriate and disproportionate.   \nThe Order’s perfunctory references to “risk” and “national security” do not absolve the \ngovernment of its due process obligations.  Courts have routinely found that, even when national \nsecurity interests are genuinely implicated (not the case here) at least some notice and process is \nrequired before the government may impair a protected liberty interest or brand an individual or \nentity with a stigmatizing label.7  Perkins Coie received no process at all.  See Burman Decl. ¶ 24.   \n                                                 \n7 See Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 533 (2004) (plurality opinion) (“[A] citizen-detainee seek-\ning to challenge his classification as an enemy combatant must receive notice of the factual basis \nfor his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government’s factual assertions before a \n \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 41 of 57\n \nAny claim to deference based on national security considerations, moreover, cannot ignore \nthe significant interests that weigh against the punishments meted out by the Order.  Where the \ngovernment’s penalties “threaten[] to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights[,] ... \na more stringent vagueness [and fair-notice] test should apply.”  112 Vill. of Hoffman Est. v. Flip-\nside,  Hoffman  Est.,  Inc.,  455  U.S.  489,  498-99  (1982).    Because  core  “first  amendment \nguarantee[s]” are implicated, the decision to punish Perkins Coie cannot be made “arbitrarily or \nfor less than compelling reasons.”  Sherrill v. Knight, 569 F.2d 124, 129 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  As \nexplained above, the Order was issued based on a patently impermissible desire to punish Perkins \nCoie for its association with clients the President perceives as political opponents or personal en-\nemies, and whose positions he attributes to the Firm.  That improper and arbitrary motive further \nunderscores the likelihood of success on the merits. \n3.  The Executive Order Is Impermissibly Vague   \nThe Order’s intentional vagueness creates an independent due process problem.  A federal \nlaw is unconstitutionally vague and thus violates due process if it “fails to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.”  United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 \n(2008) (citation omitted).  The Order suffers from both defects.  It leaves key provisions undefined.  \nFor example, the “Personnel” provision is so broad that Perkins Coie and its clients do not know \nthe full set of circumstances under which the Firm will be barred from “engaging with” govern-\nment employees.  Similarly, the Order’s repeated references to the “interests of the United States” \nand the “goals and priorities” of the Administration leave Defendants free to pick and choose how \n                                                 \nneutral decision-maker.”); Joint Anti-Fascist, 341 U.S. at 165-74 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (due \nprocess requires notice and hearing for an organization slated to be designated as “Communist”); \nNational Council of Resistance of Iran, 251 F.3d at 201, 208-09 (designating an entity a “foreign \nterrorist organization” without adequate notice or hearing violated due process). \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 42 of 57\n \nthey will enforce the Order.  The Order thus “impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to \n[Defendants] for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbi-\ntrary and discriminatory application.”  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972); \nsee also Humanitarian Law Project v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 463 F. Supp. 2d 1049, 1070 (C.D. \nCal. 2006) (executive order that “lends itself to subjective interpretation” was unconstitutional).   \nD.  The Executive Order Violates Sixth Amendment and Due Process Rights to \nCounsel \nPerkins Coie also will succeed in its Sixth Amendment and due process right-to-counsel \nclaims.  “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the Assistance \nof Counsel.”  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  That includes both “the right to the effective assistance of \ncounsel,” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984) (quotation omitted), and the “right \nto choose one’s own counsel,” Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159 (1988).  The same prin-\nciple extends to civil cases, where clients have due process liberty and property interests in their \ncontractual relationships, including with counsel.  Supra p.28.  As discussed below, lawyers have \nstanding to challenge the government’s invasion of their attorney-client relationships and thus to \nprotect their clients’ right to counsel.  Perkins Coie represents individuals and entities being inves-\ntigated and prosecuted by the government, and hundreds of clients in other matters involving the \ngovernment.  The Order’s interference with those clients’ right to counsel cannot stand. \nBut the Order is not only an assault on the Firm and its clients.  It is a reckless assault on \nthe criminal justice system and the rule of law.  The constitutional right to counsel is “fundamental” \nbecause criminal defense lawyers are essential “to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in \nwhich every defendant stands equal before the law.”  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 \n(1963).  Without criminal defense counsel, “justice will not still be done.”  Id. at 343 (cleaned up).  \nThe Firm’s right-to-counsel claims are substantial. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 43 of 57\n \n1.  Perkins Coie Has Standing To Challenge These Violations \nThere is no question that the Firm has constitutional standing to challenge the Executive \nOrder’s infringement of its clients’ right to counsel.  Defendants’ violations have caused, and will \ncontinue to cause, “concrete injury in fact” to the Firm’s livelihood and its constitutional obligation \nto provide effective counsel to those who choose it; restraining and striking the Order would re-\ndress those harms.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 (2021). \nIn addition, lawyers have prudential, third-party standing to challenge violations of their \nclients’ Sixth Amendment or due process rights to counsel that interfere with the lawyers’ practice.  \nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624 n.3 (1989); Triplett, 494 U.S. \nat 720.  In particular, because an attorney’s duty to provide effective counsel “may not be fettered \nby harassment of government officials,” a lawyer has “standing to challenge any act which inter-\nferes with his professional obligation to his client and thereby, through the lawyer, invades the \nclient’s constitutional right to counsel.”  Wounded Knee Legal Def./Offense Comm. v. Fed. Bureau \nof Investigation, 507 F.2d 1281, 1284 (8th Cir. 1974); accord Fed. Defs. of N.Y., Inc. v. Fed. Bu-\nreau of Prisons, 954 F.3d 118, 126 (2d Cir. 2020).  Because the Firm represents criminal \ndefendants and others in dealings with the government, it has standing to challenge the Order’s \nattempted interference with its clients’ rights to counsel. \n2.  The Executive Order Violates Bedrock Sixth Amendment Rights \nThe Executive Order will violate criminal defendants’ Sixth Amendment rights to effective \ncounsel and to counsel of their choice.  That already has begun.  \nFirst, by attempting to “interfere[] with [Perkins Coie’s] professional obligation[s]” to its \ncriminal defense clients, the Order infringes upon those defendants’ rights to effective counsel.  \nWounded Knee, 507 F.2d at 1284.  The Order directs “[t]he heads of all agencies”—including the \nDepartment of Justice—to “limit[] Government employees acting in their official capacity from \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 44 of 57\n \nengaging with Perkins Coie employees” and “limit[] official access from Federal Government \nbuildings to employees of Perkins Coie.”  EO § 5(a).  The Order threatens to prevent Perkins Coie \nattorneys from performing the vast array of legal tasks that require interacting with government \nemployees or visiting government buildings, ranging from conferring on discovery and procedural \nmatters to negotiating plea agreements to attending meetings and hearings.  “[T]he right to ade-\nquate assistance of counsel cannot be defined or enforced without taking account of the central \nrole plea bargaining plays in securing convictions and determining sentences.”  Lafler v. Cooper, \n566 U.S. 156, 170 (2012); see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 373 (2010) (plea negotia-\ntions are “a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective \nassistance of counsel”).  Plea agreements, in particular, routinely require substantive, intensive, \nand extended negotiations.  Yet the Order threatens to block the Firm’s attorneys from engaging \nin such discussions, infringing their clients’ Sixth Amendment rights and the Firm’s ability to \neffectively and zealously represent those clients.  Green Decl. at 6.  This is not hypothetical; gov-\nernment employees have already canceled meetings, citing the Order.  Burman Decl. ¶¶ 25-26. \nSecond, the Order infringes “[t]he right to select counsel of one’s choice,” which “has been \nregarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee” of the right to counsel.  United States \nv. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 147-48 (2006).  “[T]he most important decision a defendant \nmakes in shaping his defense is his selection of an attorney.”  United States v. Laura, 607 F.2d 52, \n56 (3rd Cir. 1979).  The upshot of the Order, however, is to obstruct that selection:  the government \ndefamed Perkins Coie as “dishonest and dangerous,” EO § 1, singled out the Firm with unique \nrestrictions on its practice, EO §§ 3, 5, and is forcing the Firm’s many government contractor \nclients to disclose their relationship with the Firm and face termination of contracts, EO § 3(a)-(b).  \nIt is irrelevant that the government is not expressly barring clients from hiring the Firm; the Order \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 45 of 57\n \nintends to achieve that goal indirectly, and “a government official cannot do indirectly what [h]e \nis barred from doing directly.”  Vullo, 602 U.S. at 190.  “[I]f a defendant chooses a particular \ncounsel, the sixth amendment prevents [the government] from taking any ‘arbitrary action prohib-\niting the effective use of (a particular) counsel.’”  Laura, 607 F.2d at 57 (quoting United States ex \nrel. Carey v. Rundle, 409 F.2d 1210, 1215 (3d Cir. 1969)).  In addition, interfering with counsel’s \neffectiveness can itself violate choice of counsel: a lawyer who could not effectively represent a \nclient because of limitations on his practice would be forced by the Rules of Professional Conduct \nto withdraw.  Simon Decl. ¶ 36.  By seeking to interfere with the Firm’s effectiveness, the Order \ncompromises criminal defendants’ choice of Perkins Coie to defend them. \n3.  The Executive Order Also Violates the Due Process Right to Counsel \nThe Order’s effects reach beyond the Sixth Amendment.  Clients also have due process \ninterests in their attorney-client relationships.  Clients enjoy “the right to the aid of counsel when \ndesired and provided by the party asserting the right.”  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68 (1932); \naccord Doe v. District of Columbia, 697 F.2d 1115, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“[E]very litigant has \na powerful interest in being able to retain and consult freely with an attorney.”); see also Simon \nDecl. ¶ 22.  “[A]rbitrarily” interfering with and chilling those attorney-client relationships “would \nbe a denial … of due process in the constitutional sense.”  Powell, 287 U.S. at 69.  The Order does \njust that.  And, as with the Firm’s due-process interests discussed above, the Executive Order failed \nto provide adequate process before interfering with those rights to counsel.  Supra pp.29-30.   \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 46 of 57\n \nE.  The Executive Order Violates Equal Protection  \nPerkins Coie also will succeed on its equal protection claim.8  Equal protection bars the \ngovernment not only from discriminating against entire classes, but also from disfavoring individ-\nuals without a constitutionally legitimate basis.  Such “class-of-one”9 claims require showing that \nthe plaintiff has (1) “been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated” and \n(2) “there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.”  Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000); see also McCrea v. District of Columbia, 2021 WL 1216522, at *8 (D.D.C. \nMar. 31, 2021).  When the differential treatment burdens a plaintiff’s First Amendment activity, a \ntest “appreciably more stringent than ‘minimum rationality’” applies.  See News Am. Pub., Inc. v. \nFCC, 844 F.2d 800, 814 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  “The classic class-of-one claim is illustrated when a \npublic official, with no conceivable basis for his action other than spite or some other improper \nmotive … comes down hard” on a citizen.  Swanson v. City of Chetek, 719 F.3d 780, 784 (7th Cir. \n2013) (cleaned up); see Brunson v. Murray, 843 F.3d 698, 705 (7th Cir. 2016) (“[C]lass-of-one \nclaims are designed to prevent government actors from singling out a person for arbitrary abuse.”).  \nBoth prongs of the class-of-one test are readily met.  First, the Order intentionally targets \nPerkins Coie with extraordinary sanctions not levied on similarly situated firms or lawyers.  The \nintentional and targeted nature of the sanctions is clear.  Supra pp.16-22.  So is the differential \ntreatment.  Because “improper motive is usually covert,” class-of-one claims ordinarily require \n                                                 \n8 The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains an equal protection component applicable \nto the federal government.  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498 (1954).  The “[e]qual protection \nanalysis … is the same.”  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976).   \n9 Despite the “class-of-one” moniker, “there is no requirement that the challenged government \naction single out one solitary person.”  Franks v. Rubitschun, 312 F. App’x 764, 765 n.2 (6th Cir. \n2009).  “[T]he number of individuals” being targeted “is immaterial.”  Olech, 528 U.S. at 564 n.*.  \nThe key to the claim is that the differential treatment is not based on “[m]embership in a protected \nclass” but rather arbitrary mistreatment or animus.  Franks, 312 F. App’x at 765-66. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 47 of 57\n \nshowing that “similarly situated individuals … received more favorable treatment.”  Swanson, 719 \nF.3d at 784.  That is easy enough:  No other firm has been subjected to the same sanctions as \nPerkins Coie.  Moreover, unlike in run-of-the-mill class-of-one claims, the “improper motive” is \nplain on the face of the Executive Order and the Administration’s related public statements.  Supra \npp.9-10, 16-24.  Where, as here, “animus is readily obvious,” strictly applying the comparator \nrequirement is unnecessary to establish an equal protection violation.  Swanson, 719 F.3d at 784; \nsee SBT Holdings v. Town of Westminster, 547 F.3d 28, 35 & n.4 (1st Cir. 2008) (same); Stevens \nv. Holder, 950 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1289-91 (N.D. Ga. 2013) (plaintiff pleaded class-of-one claim \nbased on her “exclusion” from government meetings for reasons “she suspects … were false”).   \nSecond, the government cannot justify its conduct under even rational basis review, much \nless heightened scrutiny.  The government must put forward a “plausible reason” for its differential \ntreatment, FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313-14 (1993), which cannot be “so at-\ntenuated” from its conduct “as to render [it] arbitrary or irrational,” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985) (citing, inter alia, U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 \nU.S. 528, 535 (1973)).  A “bare … desire to harm a politically unpopular group” is “not [a] legit-\nimate state interest[].”  Id. at 447 (quoting Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534); see also Romer v. Evans, 517 \nU.S. 620, 632 (1996) (where a governmental act is “so discontinuous with the reasons offered” \nthat it “seems inexplicable by anything but animus,” it “lacks a rational relationship to legitimate \nstate interests”).  Here, the evidence already shows that the Order is not rationally related to any \nlegitimate interest but instead is intended and functions as retribution.  Supra pp.9-10, 16-24.   \nII.  A TRO IS NEEDED TO STOP IRREPARABLE HARM \nFor a TRO, irreparable harm must be “‘both certain and great,’ ‘actual ... not theoretical,’ \nand ‘of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.’”  Drs. for Am. \nv. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 2025 WL 452707, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025) (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 48 of 57\n \nFed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  This is a “high standard,” id., \nbut amply met in the context of this Order, which is imposing extraordinary and escalating—po-\ntentially fatal, if unaddressed—injury on Perkins Coie.  Constitutional rights already have been \nviolated, agencies already have refused to engage with the Firm, clients already have terminated \nrepresentations, employees already have considered whether to leave the Firm, potential employ-\nees already have questioned whether to work there, and much more.  Burman Decl. ¶¶ 24-34. \nThe threat to Perkins Coie is truly existential—which is the Order’s objective.  If no TRO \nis granted, the Firm may not be solvent long enough for the Court to hear this case on the merits.  \nIf that happens, the fact that the Order is patently unconstitutional will make no difference.    \nA.  Perkins Coie Is Suffering Irreparable Economic Harm \nIn days, the Executive Order has already subjected the Firm to multiple millions of dollars \nin unrecoverable losses.  Burman Decl. ¶ 29.  While economic loss is not always irreparable, Har-\nris v. Bessent, 2025 WL 521027, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025) (granting TRO), economic injuries \njustify emergency equitable relief where “legal remedies after the fact [are] inadequate to restore \nthe party seeking a stay to the status quo ante.”  Mann v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 185 F. \nSupp. 3d 189, 195 (D.D.C. 2016).  Courts have articulated two scenarios in which economic losses \nare irreparable.  First, even “[r]ecoverable monetary loss may constitute irreparable harm … where \nthe loss threatens the very existence of the movant’s business.”  Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.  \nSecond, where damages are unrecoverable (for example, due to sovereign immunity), “significant” \neconomic loss may constitute irreparable harm.  Luokung Tech. Corp. v. Dep’t of Def., 538 F. \nSupp. 3d 174, 192 (D.D.C. 2021) (issuing injunction). \nFirst, absent relief, Perkins Coie can “reasonably fear a tsunami of adverse consequences \nthat would threaten its ability to continue to effectively operate,” including the departure of clients, \npartners, and practice groups.  Hirshon Decl. ¶ 14.  Of the Firm’s nine practice groups, all “intersect \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 49 of 57\n \nwith the federal government in some way and include clients with business before the federal \ngovernment.”  Burman Decl. ¶ 12.  The “vast bulk of [Perkins Coie’s] clients have matters” that \ndemand the Firm interact with federal agencies.  Id. ¶ 13.  Lost business will not be replaced, as \nmany current and prospective clients have matters related to the federal government.  See Nalco \nCo. v. EPA, 786 F. Supp. 2d 177, 188 (D.D.C. 2011) (irreparable harm from “loss of long-standing \nclients that may be unwilling, or unable, to do business with [plaintiff] hereafter if no injunction \nis issued” (cleaned up)).  If the Order is not restrained, the Firm may not recover. \nThe Order also imposes irreparable harm by hindering the Firm’s ability “to recruit and \nretain employees to build—or even maintain—its business.”  TikTok, Inc. v. Trump, 490 F. Supp. \n3d 73, 84 (D.D.C. 2020) (issuing injunction); see also Luokung, 538 F. Supp. 3d at 193 (same).  \nThe Order’s hiring restrictions (EO § 5) will “impair Perkins Coie’s hiring of lawyer and non-\nlawyer professionals because of the risk that joining a law firm disfavored by the President would \ndestroy any possible future in federal government service (e.g., as a federal prosecutor).”  Hirshon \nDecl. ¶ 13.  Perkins Coie is already experiencing those harms.  Burman Decl. ¶¶ 24-34.  This harm, \ntoo, threatens the Firm’s ability to survive this unprecedented attack if not addressed. \nSecond, Perkins Coie’s mounting losses are “irreparable per se” because sovereign immun-\nity limits the Firm to nonmonetary equitable relief.  See Nalco, 786 F. Supp. 2d at 188 (citation \nomitted); Luokung, 538 F. Supp. 3d at 192.  Perkins Coie is grateful for the expressions of support \nfrom and its continued relationships with many clients.  Nonetheless, in response to the Order, \ncertain clients who are government contractors or are involved in government-related litigation \nalready have terminated their attorney-client relationships.  Burman Decl. ¶ 29.  This has caused \nlosses of anticipated revenue in the millions of dollars within days.  Id.  Other large clients who \nhave tens of millions of dollars of extensive business with the Firm, making a termination of the \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 50 of 57\n \nrelationship more challenging, have expressed uncertainty about the future prospects of their rela-\ntionship  with  Perkins  Coie,  and  have  requested  daily  updates  regarding  the  Order’s \nimplementation.  Id.  The Department of Justice has already postponed one meeting with Perkins \nCoie lawyers, citing the Executive Order, and another agency has done the same.  Id. ¶¶ 25-26.  \nMore than a thousand active matters in the federal courts, and thousands more before federal agen-\ncies, are at risk.  Id. ¶ 27.  Absent relief, the Firm will incur mushrooming losses, all unrecoverable.  \nB.  The Executive Order Has Impaired Perkins Coie’s Constitutional Rights \n“[T]here is a presumed availability of federal equitable relief against threatened invasions \nof constitutional interests.”  Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(cleaned up).  “[A] prospective violation of a constitutional right constitutes irreparable injury for \n… purposes” of such relief.  Karem v. Trump, 960 F.3d 656, 667 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (omission in \noriginal) (quoting Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). Multiple such invasions \nand violations have already occurred, and many more are imminent. \nFirst Amendment. “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of \ntime, constitutes irreparable injury.”  Cigar Ass’n of Am. v. U.S. FDA, 317 F. Supp. 3d 555, 562 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (cleaned up) (granting injunction) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976)).  Such a showing can be based on “First Amendment freedoms [that] are actually lost,” or \nthat “imminently will be.”  Bailey v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 2024 WL 3219207, at *9 (D.D.C. \nJune 28, 2024) (granting injunction).  The Order attacks Perkins Coie for allegedly “partisan” \nspeech and activity, and sets out specific retaliatory consequences.  In retaliating against Perkins \nCoie for its First Amendment activity, the Order threatens to halt the Firm’s, its clients’, and others’ \nprotected petitioning activity and other speech; to restrict unconstitutionally its protected conduct; \nand to infringe on its right to associate with the clients it chooses.  Supra pp.19-24.  \nThese First Amendment violations are “certain, because [they] ha[ve] already occurred, \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 51 of 57\n \nand [are] ongoing.”  Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 105 (D.D.C. 2012); see \nalso Cigar Ass’n of Am., 317 F. Supp. 3d at 562 (a showing of irreparable harm is sufficient where \nan order “‘threaten[s] or in fact ... impair[s]’ … First Amendment interests ‘at the time relief is \nsought.’” (second omission added) (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373)).  At the time of this filing, \nPerkins Coie’s protected activity is actively being hampered by the Order; a growing number of \ngovernment agencies have flatly refused to interact with Perkins Coie lawyers.  Burman Decl. \n¶¶ 25-27.  Clients have distanced themselves from their association with the Firm.  Id. ¶¶ 28-30.  \nThe Order thus “chill[s] the rights of clients to petition government for redress of grievances and \nto peaceably assemble, as guaranteed by the First Amendment.”  Simon Decl. ¶ 41.  \nFifth Amendment.  “[A] violation of Fifth Amendment due process rights” also suffices for \na finding of irreparable harm.   Karem, 960 F.3d at 668; see also Vote Forward v. DeJoy, 490 F. \nSupp. 3d 110, 121, 129-30 (D.D.C. 2020) (enjoining threatened impairment of voting rights).   The \nOrder violates Perkins Coie’s due process rights because it “finds wrongdoing and imposes pun-\nishment without prior notice, an opportunity to be heard, a fair and impartial factfinder, or any \nother semblance of fair process.”  Green Decl. at 4.  It interferes with Perkins Coie’s professional \nliberty interests, its liberty interests in its reputation, and its protected property interests in its con-\ntractual relationships.  Supra pp.24-31.  The harm inflicted by the Order is ongoing, and “do[es] \nnot … require proof of any injury other than the threatened constitutional deprivation itself.”  Gor-\ndon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting Davis, 158 F.3d at 1346).  As long as \nthe Order remains in place, these irreparable harms will continue.  \nThe Order’s differential treatment of Perkins Coie also constitutes an equal protection vi-\nolation.  Supra pp.35-36.  The Order imposes unique punitive sanctions on the Firm to which no \nother similarly situated law firm or lawyer has been subjected—a “class of one.”  Id.  For the \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 52 of 57\n \nreasons above, the Firm has already been harmed by these “violations of [its] rights to equal pro-\ntection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment,” which “are irreparable.”  Doe 1 v. Trump, 275 F. \nSupp. 3d 167, 216 (D.D.C. 2017), vacated sub nom. Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 755 F. App’x 19 (D.C. \nCir. 2019) (vacated on other grounds).  Relief is necessary to curb further harm. \nSixth Amendment.  “The right to select counsel of one’s choice” is “the root meaning of the \n[Sixth Amendment’s] constitutional guarantee.”  Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 147-48.  The Order \ndrastically limits the ability of Perkins Coie lawyers to represent their many clients, including \n“barring [them] from federal buildings,” Hirshon Decl. ¶ 12, “bar[ing] federal employees from \n‘engaging’ with” them, id., and requiring all federal contractor clients to “disclose any business \nthey do with” the Firm, which will subject them to a “review” solely because of that attorney-client \nrelationship, EO § 3.  In so doing, the Order “distort[s] the legal system” and infringes on “the \nfreedom of [the Firm’s] clients to choose a lawyer,” which is protected by the Constitution.  Green \nDecl. at 5 (quoting Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544; D.C. Rules of Prof. Conduct, Rule 5.6, cmt. [1]).  \n“[A]s a practical matter,” the Order “deprive[s] clients of their right to be represented by their \nchosen lawyers.”  Hirshon Decl. ¶ 12; see also Simon Decl. ¶¶ 32-35, 40.  Perkins Coie has stand-\ning to assert this harm as well.  Supra p.32. \nMany Perkins Coie clients, including the largest, have government contracts.  Burnam \nDecl. ¶ 28.  In fact, a significant part of each practice group’s clients do business with the federal \ngovernment.  Id. ¶ 18.  And many Perkins Coie representations are not public, whether or not \nrelated to government contracting.  Id. ¶ 28; see also D.C. Ethics Op. 124 (“the fact of the firm’s \nrepresentation … is a client ‘confidence’ or ‘secret’ subject to … protection[]” if client requests \nnondisclosure or if disclosure would embarrass or harm client).  The Order requires clients to dis-\nclose confidential information about their consultations with counsel, putting them at risk of \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 53 of 57\n \ntermination of their contracts.  EO § 3(a).  “The disclosure of confidential information is, by its \nvery nature, irreparable because such information, once disclosed, loses its confidential nature.”  \nRobert Half Int’l Inc. v. Billingham, 315 F. Supp. 3d 419, 433 (D.D.C. 2018) (cleaned up). \nC.  Perkins Coie Is Suffering Ongoing and Irreparable Reputational Harm. \n“Because injury to reputation or goodwill is not easily measurable in monetary terms it is \ntypically viewed as irreparable.”  Xiaomi Corp. v. Dep’t of Def., 2021 WL 950144, at *9 (D.D.C. \nMar. 12, 2021) (cleaned up).  The reputational injury here is no exception.  The Order has damaged \nPerkins Coie’s “corporate goodwill and reputation and its competitive position,” and that harm is \ngrowing.  Honeywell, Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 582 F. Supp. 1072, 1078 (D.D.C. \n1984) (issuing injunction).  Not only does the Order disparage the Firm as “dishonest” and “dan-\ngerous,” EO § 1, it threatens severe restrictions on the Firm’s ability to do work central to its \nmission.  See League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (reversing \ndenial of injunction; “obstacles” that “unquestionably make it more difficult for [movant] to ac-\ncomplish [its] primary mission” establish irreparable harm); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, \n2025 WL 368852, at *12 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (same) (issuing TRO).  There is a growing public \nperception that Perkins Coie may be restricted from representing clients in government-facing \nmatters, or even entering federal courthouses.10  As discussed above, multiple large and longstand-\ning clients, including clients who are government contractors, clients with ongoing litigation, and \nclients with matters that require engagement with federal agencies, have already taken their busi-\nness elsewhere, citing doubts about the Firm’s ability to continue to represent them in light of the \nOrder.  Burnam Decl. ¶ 29.  Others have informed Perkins Coie that they are considering other \ncounsel, have withdrawn consent for the Firm to disclose their relationship, or otherwise have \n                                                 \n10 See, e.g., Exs. 5, 8, and 9 (articles discussing the impact of the Executive Order). \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 54 of 57\n \nexpressed uncertainty about their continued relationship with the Firm.  Id. \nThe (false) suggestion that a law firm is so untrustworthy that it cannot be permitted to \nrepresent clients in interactions with the federal government, in federal agencies, and in federal \ncourtrooms poses concrete, here-and-now harm to the Firm’s reputation.  This Court has found far \nless reputational damage to be irreparable.11  Emergency relief that preserves Perkins Coie’s ability \nto advocate on behalf of its clients is necessary to limit the reputational damage.  \nIII.  THE EQUITIES AND PUBLIC INTEREST STRONGLY FAVOR A TRO \nWhere a movant “seeks to enjoin the government, the final two TRO factors—balancing \nthe equities and the public interest—merge.”  Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. Trump, 2025 WL 435415, \nat *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2025) (citation omitted).  Courts weigh “the competing claims of injury and \n… consider the effect on each party [and the public] of the granting or withholding of the requested \nrelief.”  Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008) (citation omitted). \nHere, the balance of the equities and the public interest overwhelmingly favor a TRO.  The \ninjury to Perkins Coie has been immediate and severe.  The Firm not only has suffered immense \nreputational harm by being falsely branded as “dishonest and dangerous,” such that its personnel \nshould not be permitted on federal property or to engage with federal employees, but has already \nlost clients and risks losing more.  Supra pp.7-9, 37-39.  In contrast, any purported injury to the \nUnited States is non-existent.  For example, the Order complains that former Perkins Coie lawyers \nrepresented the President’s political opponent in 2016 and hired an investigative firm that produced \na “dossier” about him.  But those are personal grievances from nine years ago.  The President \n                                                 \n11 See, e.g., Xiaomi, 2021 WL 950144, at *1, 9 (“almost unquestionable” that plaintiff’s designa-\ntion as “Communist Chinese military company” “damaged its reputation[]”); Beacon Assocs., Inc. \nv. Apprio, Inc., 308 F. Supp. 3d 277, 288 (D.D.C. 2018) (“termination for default … left a black \nmark on [plaintiff’s] reputation, irreparable absent an injunction”); Patriot, Inc. v. HUD, 963 F. \nSupp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (agency letter that characterized plaintiff as “‘enticing’ senior citizens \ninto meetings, and ‘pressuring’ them” into financial decisions was irreparable reputational harm). \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 55 of 57\n \nalready asserted the same allegations in a lawsuit filed in his personal capacity, which was dis-\nmissed.  See Trump, 626 F. Supp. 3d 1264 (appeal pending).   \nThe Order also complains that the Firm represented clients in suits to challenge election \nlaws.  But representing clients who petition the courts in election-related lawsuits does not inflict \ncognizable injury on the United States where, as here, the lawsuits were meritorious or non-frivo-\nlous.  To the extent the Order notes former Perkins Coie lawyers’ alleged “lack of candor” in a \nsingle court case, that is a matter the judicial branch already addressed.  The injury to Perkins Coie \nfrom the Order greatly outweighs any purported injury to the United States from its being enjoined.   \nMore broadly, there is no public interest in executive agencies implementing an illegal \nexecutive order, like the present one.  See League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 12 (“There is \ngenerally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”).  But there is a “sub-\nstantial public interest” in having governmental agencies “abide” by the law.  Id. (citation omitted).  \nUnless enjoined, the Order will undermine the strong public interest in lawyers’ zealously \nrepresenting clients without fear of government retribution.  Under the Rules of Professional Con-\nduct, “[t]he duty of a lawyer, both to the client and to the legal system, is to represent the client \nzealously within the bounds of the law.”  E.g., D.C. Rules Pro. Conduct r. 1.3 cmt. [1].  A lawyer \nis required to “take whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause \nor endeavor.”  Id.  “[V]igorous representation” is of “paramount importance” to “our adversarial \nsystem of justice.”  Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 84 (1988).  “This system is premised on the well-\ntested principle that truth—as well as fairness—is best discovered by powerful statements on both \nsides of the question.”  Id. (cleaned up).   \nAs explained in the attached expert declarations, the threat of presidential sanctions will \nchill lawyers from representing clients whom the President views as political opponents, or from \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 56 of 57\n \nadvocating legal positions that the President dislikes.  Hirshon Decl. ¶ 3; Green Decl. at 4-5; Simon \nDecl. ¶ 6.  “[T]he Executive Orders will have the effect of forcing lawyers to choose between \nperforming their assigned role in our democracy or pleasing the President, all to the detriment of \nclients and the fair administration of justice.”  Hirshon Decl. ¶ 17.  Indeed, the Order already is \nhaving this chilling effect, as reported by the press.  Supra pp.8-10, 37-28.    \nThis chill will make it immensely harder for clients who are unpopular with the current \nadministration to find legal representation, undermining the basic public policy favoring “the free-\ndom of clients to choose a lawyer,” D.C. Rules Pro. Conduct r. 5.6, cmt. [1], and the Sixth \nAmendment right to counsel of choice in criminal cases, Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 144.  The \nRules of Professional Conduct provide that lawyers have a responsibility to “accept[] a fair share \nof unpopular matters or … unpopular clients.”  D.C. Rules Pro. Conduct r. 6.2, cmt. [1].  As the \nRules of Professional Conduct provide, “[l]egal representation should not be denied to people … \nwhose cause is controversial or the subject of popular disapproval.”  Id. at r. 1.2, cmt. [3].  Yet the \nOrder threatens to punish lawyers for fulfilling this critical responsibility.   \nFinally, by chilling zealous representation, the Order will impair the functioning of the \njudiciary itself.  “An informed, independent judiciary presumes an informed, independent bar,” \nVelazquez, 531 U.S. at 545—not a bar under threat of political retribution from the President.  If \nthis Order stands, nothing will prevent the next President from meting out punishment to lawyers \nwho represent his or her opponents.  The public interest—and indeed the very functioning of our \nlegal system—demand entry of a TRO.   \nCONCLUSION \n  Perkins Coie respectfully requests that the Court hold a hearing as soon as possible, grant \nthe motion for a temporary restraining order, and enter the attached proposed order. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716     Document 2-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 57 of 57\n \nDated: March 11, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n            WILLIAMS & CONNOLLY LLP \n              By:  /s/ Dane H.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n \n   \nPERKINS COIE LLP,   \n \n \n \n  Plaintiff, \n \n \nCivil Action No. 1:25-cv-00716-BAH \nv.  \n \n \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISQUALIFY  \nJUDGE BERYL HOWELL \n \nFair proceedings free from any suggestion of impartiality are essential to the integrity of \nour country’s judiciary and the need to curtail ongoing improper encroachments of President \nTrump’s Executive Power playing out across the country.  In this case, reasonable observers may \nwell view this Court as insufficiently impartial to adjudicate the meritless challenges to President \nTrump’s efforts to implement the agenda that the American people elected him to carry out.  In \nfact, this Court has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President.  \nExamples include this Court enabling the improper efforts of disgraced former prosecutor Jack \nSmith despite a readily apparent lack of venue in this District; wrongly suggesting in public that \nPresident Trump is an authoritarian; and incorrectly finding that President Trump—the most well-\nknown man on Earth—presents a flight risk where even the prior Administration’s Department of \nJustice had to retract such a suggestion.  This Court’s comments at the hearing on the meritless \nmotion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) in this case, including gratuitous and biased \nreferences by this Court regarding the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller (“Mueller \nReport”), confirm that reasonable observers may view this Court as incapable of fairly adjudicating \nthese claims against the Commander-In-Chief. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 2 of 8\nAccordingly, to ensure that these proceedings are free from any suggestion of impartiality, \nthe Defendants move to disqualify this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a).  This case involves serious \nconcerns about election integrity, national security, and the past actions of the law firm Perkins \nCoie LLP.  Given the statements made by the Court at the initial hearing in this matter and its out-\nof-court statements, the Court’s impartiality in this case might reasonably be questioned.  See 28 \nU.S.C.  §  455(a).   Accordingly,  Defendants  respectfully  submit  that  this  matter  should  be \ntransferred to another district court judge who was neither involved with Mueller Report nor the \ninvestigation  of  Special  Counsel  John  Durham  (“Durham  Investigation”)  and  who  has  not \ndemonstrated a pattern of hostility towards Defendants. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nRecusal is mandatory where a judge’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  28 \nU.S.C. § 455(a) (explaining that a federal judge “shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in \nwhich his impartiality might reasonably be questioned”).  A judge also “shall” recuse where she \n“has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.”  28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1).  “[T]he question is \nwhether a reasonable and informed observer would question the judge’s impartiality.”  Stone v. \nU.S. Embassy Tokyo, 2020 WL 5653699, at *1 (D.D.C. 2020) (quotation omitted); see also SEC v. \nLoving Spirit Found., 392 F.3d 486, 493 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  \nThe touchstone for recusal under Section 455(a) is “not the reality of bias or prejudice but \nits appearance.”  Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 548 (1994). “The very purpose of § 455(a) \nis to promote confidence in the judiciary by avoiding even the appearance of impropriety whenever \npossible.” United States v. Patti, 337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 865 (1988)).  Thus, “any doubts must be resolved in favor \nof recusal.” Id.; see also Parker v. Connors Steel Co., 855 F.2d 1510, 1524 (11th Cir. 1988) (“It \nhas been stated on numerous occasions that when a judge harbors any doubts concerning whether \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 3 of 8\nhis disqualification is required he should resolve the doubt in favor of disqualification.”).  The \nSupreme Court has explained that remarks by a court may constitute a basis for recusal if “they \ndisplay a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.” Liteky \n510 U.S. at 555. \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiff’s lawsuit challenges the President’s Executive Order issued on March 6, 2025, \nentitled Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP (the “EO”).  The EO explains that Perkins Coie \nLLP has engaged in a “pattern” of “dishonest and dangerous activity.”  Notably, members of \nPlaintiff’s firm were involved in matters subject to the Durham Investigation, culminating with the \nindictment of one member of Plaintiff’s firm.  This Court is no stranger to this issue given its role \nin the Mueller investigation.  \na.  This Court’s Systematic Hostility Toward President Trump \nThis Court has not kept its disdain for President Trump secret.  It has voiced its thoughts \nloudly—both inside and outside the courtroom.  In a November 2023 speech that this Court \ndelivered at a Women’s White Collar Defense Association event, it lamented that America is at a \n“crossroads” and, in an apparent reference to President Trump, indicated that one path would lead \nto  authoritarianism.    See  2023  WWCDA  Awards  Gala  Full  Video, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDnJWh1gzE  (last  accessed  March  21,  2025).    Judge \nHowell’s remarks did not live in a vacuum.  They prompted a judicial misconduct complaint from \na member of Congress and serious media scrutiny.  See Complaint of Judicial Misconduct Against \nJudge  Beryl  Howell  filed  by  Elise  Stefanik, \nhttps://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24224161/stefanik20judicial20complaint20howell20de\nc2015.pdf  (Dec. 15, 2023); see, e.g., Gerstein, Judge key to Jan. 6 cases warns US faces \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 4 of 8\n‘authoritarian’  threat,  https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/28/jan-6-authoritarian-threat-\ndemocracy-00129013 (Nov. 28, 2023).  \nThis Court’s hostility toward President Trump is also on full display through her disdain \nfor his supporters.  For example, in response to a basic dismissal motion under Federal Criminal \nRule of Procedure 48, this Court took the opportunity to grandstand about the 2020 election and \nPresident Trump’s supporters.  Directly rejecting the president’s determination that dismissal of \npending indictments “against individuals for their conduct related to the events at or near the \nUnited States Capitol on January 6, 2021” would “end[] a grave national injustice that has been \nperpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begin[] a process of national \nreconciliation,”  Proclamation  10887,  Granting  Pardons  and  Commutation  of  Sentences  for \nCertain Offenses Relating to the Events at or Near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, \n90 Fed. Reg. 8331 (Jan. 20, 2025), the Court curtly stated that no “national injustice” occurred \nhere, United States v. Jovanovic, Case No. 25-cr-15, 2025 WL 266551, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 2025).  \nThe  Court  then  engaged  in  wholly  inappropriate  name-calling,  repeatedly  calling  President \nTrump’s  supporters  “sore  losers”  and  stating  that  the  President’s  pronouncement  relayed  a \n“revisionist myth.”  Id.  \nThis Court’s pattern of hostility toward President Trump is not limited to his supporters.  It \nalso utilized the judicial power against President Trump himself.  During the height of Jack Smith’s \nweaponized lawfare against President Trump, this Court found “reason to believe that the former \nPresident  would  ‘flee  from  prosecution’”—despite  President Trump  being  one  of  the  most \nrecognizable figures in the world.  See In re Sealed Case, 77 F.4th 815, 822 n.2 (D.C. Cir 2023) \n(noting that even the government later acknowledged that “it had ‘errantly included flight from \nprosecution as a predicate’ in its application”).   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 5 of 8\nLater, in the waning moments of its seven-year term as Chief Judge, this Court ruled that \nprivate documents belonging to President Trump’s personal attorney must be given to Smith.  \nInvoking the rarely used “crime-fraud” exception, this Court pierced attorney-client privilege, \nordering President Trump’s attorney to testify before a D.C. grand jury investigating the alleged \nretention of government documents in South Florida.  See In re: Sealed Case, Case No. 1:23-gj-\n00010 (D.D.C); Feuer, Trump Lawyer in Mar-a-Lago Case Must Hand Over Records, Appeals \nCourt Says, NEW YORK TIMES (Mar. 22, 2023).  Notably, this Court issued its ruling when venue \nfor the grand jury proceedings in the case was squarely in the Southern District of Florida—not \nthe District of Columbia.  Indeed, the district court judge in the Southern District of Florida \nappeared troubled by this Court’s procedure and seemed inclined to engage in an extended \nevidentiary hearing to address it before ultimately dismissing the unconstitutional case against \nPresident Trump on other grounds.  See, e.g., ECF Nos. 566, 605, United States v. Trump, No. 23-\ncr-80101 (S.D. Fla. 2023). \nAdditionally, in 2023, this Court held Twitter in contempt of court for failing to comply \nwith Jack Smith’s demand for President Trump’s Twitter direct messages.  This Court could not \nresist from editorializing, asking whether Musk “wants to cozy up with the former president” and \nwhether Twitter’s efforts were “to make Donald Trump feel like he is a particularly welcomed new \nrenewed user of Twitter.”  In the Matter of the Search of: Information That is Stored at Premises \nControlled by Twitter Inc., Case. No. 1:23-sc-00031 (D.D.C.), Transcript of Hearing Before the \nHonorable Beryl Howell on February 7, 2023, at 1:32 p.m. at 36:5–6, 60:18–20.  \n   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 6 of 8\nb.  This Court’s Conduct in this Case  \nSimultaneously with filing its complaint in this case, Plaintiff filed a motion for a TRO.  \nSee ECF No. 2.  Within 24 hours of the complaint being filed, this Court conducted a a hearing on \nthe TRO and ruled from the bench, granting the requested relief.  See ECF No. 21.  \nDuring the course of the hearing, a number of exchanges took place between the Court and \nDefendants’ counsel regarding the activities of Perkins Coie attorneys and the 2016 election—\nspecifically their involvement in the procurement and distribution of the report by Fusion GPS. \nECF No. 22, Hearing Tr. at 31–35, 49–50. This report has now been fully discredited, and the role \nof Perkins Coie attorneys in the distribution of this report was a centerpiece of the Durham \nInvestigation.  Yet this Court stated: “I know the President has just—you know, based on reading \nthese papers, he was upset about that in 2016; he was so upset about this still he filed a lawsuit \nagainst Perkins Coie and others in the Southern District of Florida that was dismissed in rapid \norder.  He keeps bringing it up.  It’s like he doesn’t want any of us to forget Fusion GPS.  He doesn’t \nwant any of us to forget that—any of this.  He really has a bee in his bonnet about it.”  ECF No. \n22, Hearing Tr. at 49:22–50:5 (emphasis added).  \n  As seen in the above exchange, issues of the Durham Investigation, the Fusion GPS report, \nand the Mueller Report are central to the EO.  The Court’s condescending remark that President \nTrump had “a bee in his bonnet” about Fusion GPS demonstrate a concerning and dismissive \napproach to the entire Durham Investigation—an Investigation that touched on the Court’s role in \nthe Mueller Report and one in which members of the Plaintiff’s firm played a primary and essential \nrole.  The entire Fusion GPS fiasco is a lamentable part of this nation’s history.  As demonstrated \nthrough comments in this proceeding, other judicial proceedings, and in the public, observers \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 7 of 8\nmight reasonably have concerns about the Court’s impartiality in this matter.  Recusal is warranted \nto ensure these proceedings fair and free from concerns about impartiality. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants deserve a court proceeding free from concerns about impartiality.  In order to \nremove the possibility of any impartiality to these proceedings, Defendants respectfully request \nthat this Court recuse itself and return this matter to assignment before a judge free from any \nappearance of hostility toward this Administration and is otherwise unconnected with any matter \nrelated to the Mueller Report or Durham Investigation. \nDated: March 21, 2025         Respectfully Submitted,  \nWashington, DC \n \nCHAD MIZELLE \nActing Associate Attorney General \n \n \n/s/ Richard Lawson       \nRICHARD LAWSON \nDeputy Associate Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20530 \nTelephone: (202) 445-8042 \n \nCounsel for Defendants \n   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 34     Filed 03/21/25     Page 8 of 8\nCERTIFICATE OF CONFERRAL  \n \n  Consistent with Local Rule 7(m), Defendants apprised opposing counsel of the \nanticipated motion; Plaintiffs oppose the relief sought.  \n \n/s/ Richard Lawson       \nRICHARD LAWSON \nDeputy Associate Attorney General \n \n8 \n ",

Howell \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nNo American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this \nlawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch \nagencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who \npenned the phrase: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.”  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, \nHENRY VI, PART 2, act 4, sc. 2, l. 75.  When Shakespeare’s character, a rebel leader intent on \nbecoming king, see id. l. 74, hears this suggestion, he promptly incorporates this tactic as part of \nhis plan to assume power, leading in the same scene to the rebel leader demanding “[a]way with \nhim,” referring to an educated clerk, who “can make obligations and write court hand,” id. l. 90, \n106.  Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the \npath to more power.  See Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 371 n.24 \n(1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining the import of the same Shakespearean statement to be \n“that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government”).  \nThe importance of independent lawyers to ensuring the American judicial system’s fair \nand impartial administration of justice has been recognized in this country since its founding era.  \nIn 1770, John Adams made the singularly unpopular decision to represent eight British soldiers \ncharged with murder for their roles in the Boston Massacre and “claimed later to have suffered the \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 2 of 102\nloss of more than half his practice.”  DAVID MCCULLOUGH, JOHN ADAMS 68 (2001).  “I had no \nhesitation,” he explained, since “Council ought to be the very last thing that an accused Person \nshould want in a free Country,” and “the Bar ought . . . to be independent and impartial at all Times \nAnd  in  every  Circumstance.”    3  DIARY  AND  AUTOBIOGRAPHY  OF  JOHN  ADAMS  293  (L.H. \nButterfield et al. eds., 1961).  When the Bill of Rights was ratified, these principles were codified \ninto the Constitution: The Sixth Amendment secured the right, in “all criminal prosecutions,” to \n“have the  Assistance of Counsel for . . . defence,” U.S. CONST. amend. VI, and the Fifth \nAmendment protected “the right to the aid of counsel when desired and provided by the party \nasserting the right,” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68 (1932).1  This value placed on the role of \nlawyers caught the attention of Alexis de Tocqueville, who in reflecting on his travels throughout \nthe early United States in 1831 and 1832, insightfully remarked that “the authority . . . intrusted to \nmembers of the legal profession . . . is the most powerful existing security against the excesses of \ndemocracy.”  ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE, DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA 301 (Henry Reeve trans., 2002) \n(1835).   \nThe Supreme Court, too, has recognized the importance of lawyers to the functioning of \nthe American judicial system, since “[a]n informed, independent judiciary presumes an informed, \nindependent bar.”  Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 545 (2001).  This is so because \nCongress may legislate, the President may implement, and courts may adjudicate, “but only the \nlawyers can prepare and submit the great issues of human justice under law in such manner and \n \n1   Amici law professors highlight that the right to counsel was included in the Bill of Rights in large part to \navoid “executive control of access to counsel,” which “could distort the administration of justice.”  Br. of Amici \nCuriae 363 Law Professors in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. & for Declaratory & Permanent Injunctive Relief \n(“Law Professors’ Br.”) at 11, ECF No. 49; see also id. at 11-15 (reviewing the history of the inclusion of this right \nin the Bill of Rights and collecting authorities).  The historical backdrop for these provisions, as Justice Black \nexplained, was in direct response to the “willingness . . . of the courts of England to make ‘short shrift’ of unpopular \nand uncooperative groups,” including “lawyers whose greatest crime was to dare to defend unpopular causes.”  \nCohen v. Hurley, 366 U.S. 117, 139-40 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting); see also id. at 138-41 (reviewing the history \nand protections adopted in response).    \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 3 of 102\nform that courts, in the ultimate, may be effective.”  Williams v. Beto, 354 F.2d 698, 706 (5th Cir. \n1965).  Absent their crucial independence, lawyers would “become nothing more than parrots of \nthe views of whatever group wields governmental power at the moment.”  Cohen v. Hurley, 366 \nU.S. 117, 138 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting). \nThe instant case presents an unprecedented attack on these foundational principles.  On \nMarch 6, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14230 (“EO 14230”), 90 Fed. Reg. 11781 \n(Mar. 11, 2025), entitled “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP.”2  By its terms, this Order \nstigmatizes and penalizes a particular law firm and its employees—from its partners to its associate \nattorneys, secretaries, and mailroom attendants—due to the Firm’s representation, both in the past \nand currently, of clients pursuing claims and taking positions with which the current President \ndisagrees, as well as the Firm’s own speech.  In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase \n“Let’s kill all the lawyers,” EO 14230 takes the approach of “Let’s kill the lawyers I don’t like,” \nsending the clear message: lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.3   \n \n2   See Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. & Declaratory & Permanent Injunctive Relief (“Pl.’s MSJ”), Ex. 4, Declaration \nof Christopher N. Manning, Partner, Williams & Connolly (“Manning Decl.”), Ex. 27 (“EO 14230”), ECF No. 39-4 \nat 127.   \n \n3   This message has been heard and heeded by some targeted law firms, as reflected in their choice, after \nreportedly direct dealings with the current White House, to agree to demand terms, perhaps viewing this choice as \nthe best alternative for their clients and employees.  Yet, some clients may harbor reservations about the \nimplications of such deals for the vigorous and zealous representation to which they are entitled from ethically \nresponsible counsel, since at least the publicized deal terms appear only to forestall, rather than eliminate, the threat \nof being targeted in an Executive Order.  As amici former and current general counsel caution, a “fundamental \npremise of the rule of law” is that “when parties challenge the government, their lawyers ‘oppose[] the designated \nrepresentatives of the State,’ and ‘[t]he system assumes that adversarial testing will ultimately advance the public \ninterest in truth and fairness.’  This safeguard against government overreach fails when attorneys cannot ‘advanc[e] \nthe undivided interests of [their] client[s]’ for fear of reprisal from the government.”  Br. of Amici Curiae Former & \nCurrent General Counsel Supporting Pl. Perkins Coie, LLP at 9-10, ECF No. 99 (alterations in original; internal \ncitation omitted) (quoting Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 318-19 (1981)). \nOnly when lawyers make the choice to challenge rather than back down when confronted with government \naction raising non-trivial constitutional issues can a case be brought to court for judicial review of the legal merits, \nas was done in this case by plaintiff Perkins Coie LLP, plaintiff’s counsel Williams & Connolly, and the lawyers, \nfirms, organizations, and individuals who submitted amicus briefs in this case.  As one amicus aptly put it, “[o]ur \njudicial system is under serious threat when determining whether to file an Amicus Curiae brief could be a career \nending decision.  But, when lawyers are apprehensive about retribution simply for filing a brief adverse to the \ngovernment, there is no other choice but to do so.”  Amicus Curiae Br. of Pickering Legal LLC in Supp. of Pl.’s \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 4 of 102\nUsing the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of \nclients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish \ncertain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government \nrespond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with “tolerance, not coercion.”  303 Creative \nLLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 603 (2023).  The Supreme Court has long made clear that “no official, \nhigh or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics . . . or other matters of opinion.”  W. \nVa. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943).  Simply put, government officials \n“cannot . . . use the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression.”  NRA v. Vullo, \n602 U.S. 175, 188 (2024).   \nThat, however, is exactly what is happening here.  For this reason, and those explained \nmore fully below, Executive Order 14230 is unconstitutional, and the findings and instructions to \nExecutive Branch agencies issued in its Sections 1 through 5 cannot be allowed to stand.   \nAccordingly, the government’s Renewed Motion to Dismiss and for Expedited Judgment \n(“Gov’t’s MTD”), ECF No. 183, which seeks dismissal of the Amended Complaint, ECF No. 176, \npursuant to “Fed. R. Civ. P. 8” and “Rule 12(b) & 56,” Gov’t’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss \n& for Expedited J. (“Gov’t’s Mem.”) at 3, 4, ECF No. 43, is denied.4  Plaintiff’s Motion for \n \nRequest for a Permanent Injunction at 6, ECF No. 93.  If the founding history of this country is any guide, those who \nstood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the \nmodels lauded when this period of American history is written.  \n \n4  The moniker “defendants” is commonly used to refer to federal government components sued in civil \ncases, just as the named government components generally refer to themselves in briefing here.  See, e.g., Gov’t’s \nMem. at 4; Gov’t’s Opp’n to Pl.’s MSJ (“Gov’t’s Opp’n”) at 5, ECF No. 143.  In contrast, plaintiff refers to the \nnamed defendants in this lawsuit as “the government.”  E.g., Pl.’s Mem. of L. in Supp. of Pl.’s MSJ (“Pl.’s Mem.”) \nat 12, ECF No. 39-1; Pl.’s Mem. of L. in Opp’n to Gov’t’s MTD (“Pl.’s Opp’n”) at 1, ECF No. 142.  Here, the \nchallenged action is an Executive Order, issued by the President of the United States, that directs compliance by the \nentirety of the Executive Branch of the federal government.  See, e.g., EO 14230 § 3(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782 \n(directing action by “[t]he heads of all agencies”).  Using “the government” to refer to defendants thus more \naccurately encapsulates the circumstances of this case, where the challenge is not merely to the actions of a finite \nnumber of Executive branch components but is to the actions of the Executive branch writ large. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 5 of 102\nSummary Judgment and Declaratory and Permanent Injunctive Relief (“Pl.’s MSJ”), ECF No. 182, \nis granted.  \nTo aid in review of this Memorandum Opinion, given its length required to address the \nmultiple issues raised in the parties’ pending dispositive motions, an overview is provided.  Part \nI reviews the relevant factual and procedural background of this case.  Part II provides the legal \nstandards governing consideration of plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 56, and the government’s motion to dismiss and cross-motion for summary \njudgment, under Rules 8, 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), and 56.   \nPart III then turns to the substantive issues in dispute, which are discussed in three \nsections.  Section A considers, and rejects, the following six arguments asserted by the government \nin support of dismissal of plaintiff’s claims challenging different parts of EO 14230, namely: (1) \nthat the statements set out in the Order’s “Purpose” Section 1 are not contested; (2) that these same \nstatements merely reflect government speech and not actionable findings; (3) that plaintiff’s \nchallenges to the Order’s “Security Clearance Review” Section 2 are neither justiciable nor ripe; \n(4) that plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the Order’s “Contracting” Section 3 due to the failure \nto allege holding or performing specific work on any government contract; (5) that plaintiff lacks \nstanding to challenge the Order’s “Racial Discrimination” Section 4 because the investigation by \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) is not traceable to EO 14230; and (6) \nthat plaintiff’s challenges to the Order’s “Personnel” Section 5 are not ripe because implementing \nguidance has not yet issued.   \nSection B addresses, in six parts, eight of plaintiff’s nine claims set out in the Amended \nComplaint, finding that plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the following: (1) the claims \nof unconstitutional retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, in violation of the First Amendment, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 6 of 102\nin Counts V and VII; (2) the claim of unconstitutional compelled disclosure, in violation of the \nFirst Amendment, in Count VI; (3) the claim of unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the \nlaw, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, in Count  IV; (4) the claims that EO 14230 violates the \nFifth and Sixth Amendment right to counsel of plaintiff’s clients, in Counts VIII and IX; (5) the \nclaim of unconstitutional denial of due process of the law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, in \nCount II; and (6) the claim that EO 14230 is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Fifth \nAmendment, in Count III.5   \nFinally, Section C addresses plaintiff’s satisfaction of the requisite showings for the \nremedy sought of a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief. \nPart IV provides a brief conclusion summarizing the disposition of the pending motions. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe relevant factual and procedural background for resolving the two pending motions is \nsummarized below. \nA.  Perkins Coie LLP \nPlaintiff Perkins Coie LLP (“plaintiff” or “Firm”) is a large international law firm, founded \nin 1912, that operates in the United States as a limited liability partnership.  Pl.’s MSJ, Ex. 2, Pl.’s \nStatement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Dispute (“Pl.’s SMF”) ¶¶ 1-2, ECF \nNo. 39-2 (citing Pl.’s MSJ, Ex. 3, Decl. of David J. Burman, Partner, Perkins Coie LLP, in Supp. \nof MSJ (“2nd Burman Decl.”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 39-3).6  The Firm employs approximately 2,500 \n \n5   Plaintiff additionally claims, in Count I of the Amended Complaint, that Sections 1, 2(b), 3, and 5 of EO \n14230 violate the Constitution’s inherent separation of powers through the “Unconstitutional Exercise of Judicial \nAuthority,” Am. Compl. at 81 (Count I header); see also Pl.’s Mem. at 34 (arguing these provisions of the Order \n“invade[] the Judiciary’s authority”).  Since resolution of plaintiff’s claims alleging violations of the First, Fifth, and \nSixth Amendments entitles plaintiff to summary judgment and the full relief sought in this case, see generally infra \nParts III.B., C., the separation of powers claim asserted in Count I need not be considered. \n \n6   Unless otherwise noted, cited facts submitted by the parties are undisputed.  See Pl.’s SMF; Gov’t’s Opp’n, \nEx. 1, Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF (“Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF”), ECF No. 143-1. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 7 of 102\nlawyers and business professionals, including roughly 1,200 lawyers, id. ¶¶ 3, 10 (citing 2nd \nBurman Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8), and represents clients of all types, including large, medium, and small \nbusinesses, individuals, and other organizations, in federal and state courts around the country and \nin different tribunals around the world, id. ¶¶ 5, 7 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶¶ 5-6).  The Firm has \nconsistently been named as one of the 50 largest law firms in the United States, and the Firm and \nits attorneys have received regular recognition for excellence from various legal organizations.  Id. \n¶ 8 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 7).  Current attorneys and alumni of the Firm come from all sides \nof the political spectrum and have worked in the government under administrations of both parties \nand reflect both major political party affiliations.  Id. ¶¶ 12-14 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 9).  Most \nPerkins Coie attorneys are not politically active.  Id. ¶ 12 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 9).   \nAt the time EO 14230 was issued, “approximately” 24 Perkins Coie employees held active \nsecurity clearances, including “a dozen persons with former military or other public service \nbackgrounds,” id. ¶ 89 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 36) and two who held clearances “in connection \nwith their duties as military reservists,” id. ¶ 97 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 38).  Some also received \nclearances in connection with legal representations of clients.  Id. ¶ 89 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ \n36).  Four of these individuals were not attorneys.  Id. ¶ 98 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 38).     \nAs part of their legal practice, Perkins Coie lawyers “necessarily interact with the federal \ngovernment on behalf of their clients.”  Id. ¶ 24 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 19).  All nine of the \nFirm’s practice groups “intersect with the federal government in some way and include clients \nwith business before the federal government,” id. ¶ 29 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 21); see also id. \n¶¶ 36-56 (describing business before the federal government in each practice area); id. ¶¶ 57-59, \n62-66 (describing pro bono work involving the government), and a “significant majority of the \nfirm’s clients have matters that require Perkins Coie lawyers to interact with federal agencies,” id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 8 of 102\n¶ 33 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 22).  All of Perkins Coie’s top fifteen clients by revenue \n(representing collectively “almost a quarter of the firm’s revenue”), and many of the Firm’s other \nlarge clients currently hold contracts or subcontracts with the federal government and compete for \nsuch contracts.  Id. ¶ 147 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 47).  Perkins Coie also represents many of \nthese companies “for legal matters completely unrelated to” government contracts.  Id. \nIn  addition  to  its  legal  work,  Perkins  Coie  “has  a  longstanding  and  demonstrable \ncommitment to fostering diversity and inclusion . . . within the firm, the legal profession and its \ncommunity.”  Id. ¶ 18 (citing 2nd Burman Decl., Ex. 1 at 1, ECF No. 39-3 at 29).  The Firm runs a \n“Diversity & Inclusion Fellowship program” to which all first-year law students may apply.  Id. \n¶ 22 (citing 2nd Burman Decl., Ex. 2 at 3, ECF No. 39-3 at 38).  In 2019, the Firm also adopted the \n“Mansfield Rule,” “which aims to diversify the leadership of large law firms by broadening the \ncandidate pool for senior management positions.”  Gov’t’s Opp’n to Pl.’s MSJ (“Gov’t’s Opp’n”), \nEx. 1, Decl. of Richard Lawson, Deputy Associate Attorney General (“Lawson Decl.”), Ex. 3, \nPress Release, Perkins Coie, Perkins Coie Adopts Mansfield Rule to Boost Leadership Diversity \n(“Pl.’s 2019 Mansfield Press Release”) (Sept. 6, 2019), ECF No. 143-2 at 100 (page number refers \nto ECF header).  To do so, the Mansfield Rule requires that participating firms “certify that women, \nlawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers and lawyers with disabilities comprise at least 30 percent of \nthe candidate pool for significant leadership roles, senior lateral openings and promotions.”  Id.  \nB.  Perkins Coie’s Representation of Various Clients Cited in EO 14230 \nIn 2016, Marc Elias and other former members of a practice group within Perkins Coie, \ncalled the Political Law group, represented Hillary Clinton “in connection with her presidential \ncampaign,” against Donald J. Trump.  Pl.’s SMF ¶ 75 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 60); see also id. \n¶ 71 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 21).   As part of this representation, these former Perkins Coie \nattorneys engaged the services of opposition research firm Fusion GPS.  Pl.’s SMF ¶ 75 (citing 2nd \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 9 of 102\nBurman Decl. ¶ 60).  Elias left Perkins Coie in 2021, Pl.’s SMF ¶¶ 71, 75 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. \n¶¶ 21, 60), and none of the Firm’s attorneys involved in the engagement of Fusion GPS have been \nemployed by the law firm for at least the past three years, id. ¶ 75; see also id. ¶ 95 (stating that no \nPerkins Coie employee who held a security clearance at the time EO 14230 was issued “had any \ninvolvement in the Fusion GPS matter” (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 41)).  Another former Perkins \nCoie attorney, Michael Sussmann, who was not part of the Political Law group, had been retained, \ndue to his cybersecurity experience, by the Clinton campaign after the campaign’s emails were \nhacked.  Id. ¶ 76.  After being indicted in 2021 by a Special Counsel, appointed during the first \nTrump Administration, Sussmann was acquitted, on May 31, 2022, of the charge “of lying to the \nFBI about links between the Trump Organization and Russia.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Sussmann \nalso left Perkins Coie in 2021.  Id. \nIn the 2020 presidential election, Perkins Coie “represented a number of clients opposing \nthen-candidate Trump’s challenges” to the results of the election.  Id. ¶ 77 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. \n¶ 33).  The firm’s clients “prevailed in all but one of the challenges” brought by President Trump’s \ncampaign.  Id.  During that same election cycle, Perkins Coie also represented a number of clients \nin voting rights cases, including cases in which the firm’s clients “were successful in defending \nexisting laws against various legal challenges.”  Id. ¶ 78 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 33).  In general, \nPerkins Coie “has represented both party-affiliated and non-partisan clients in litigation over \nelection laws,” much of which was defending state election procedures and actions taken by state \nofficials.  Id. ¶ 79; see also Gov’t’s Opp’n, Ex. 1, Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF (“Gov’t’s Resp. to \nPl.’s SMF”) at 3, ECF No. 143-1 (noting that Pl.’s SMF ¶ 79 is undisputed).  In 2021, three former \nPerkins Coie attorneys were sanctioned a total of $8,700 “in connection with a single duplicative \nmotion to supplement the record in a Fifth Circuit appeal in a voting-rights case.”  Pl.’s SMF ¶ 83 \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 10 of 102\n(citing Court Order, Tex. All. for Retired Ams. v. Hughs, No. 20-40643, ECF No. 127-1 (5th Cir. \nJune 30, 2021)).        \nPerkins  Coie’s  representation  of  President  Trump’s  political  opponent  in  the  2016 \npresidential campaign and representation of other clients in connection with election litigation has \ndrawn President Trump’s attention and ire, as reflected in his public statements and his filing of a \nlawsuit against the Firm.  Specifically, on March 24, 2022, then-former President Trump filed a \nlawsuit  against  31  individuals  and  entities,  including  Perkins  Coie,  “alleging  that  [they] \n‘maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative’” that the Trump campaign was colluding with \nRussia, including by “falsifying evidence, deceiving law enforcement, and exploiting access to \nhighly-sensitive data sources,” among other allegations, and seeking over $24 million in damages.  \nPl.’s SMF ¶ 80 (quoting Compl., Trump v. Clinton et al., 2:22-cv-14102, ECF No. 1 (S.D. Fla.) \n(filed Mar. 24, 2022)).  The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, less than six months later, on \nSeptember 8, 2022, with the court finding that the lawsuit had “no merit.”  Id. ¶ 81 (quoting Trump \nv. Clinton, 626 F. Supp. 3d 1264, 1284 (S.D. Fla. 2022)).  As a result of this lawsuit, President \nTrump and one of his attorneys were sanctioned over $900,000 “for, among other things, bringing \na frivolous case ‘in order to dishonestly advance a political narrative.’”  Id. ¶ 82 (quoting Order, \nTrump v. Clinton et al., 2:22-cv-14102, ECF No. 302 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 19, 2023)).7 \nPlaintiff has provided copies of approximately twenty statements made by President Trump \nsince the 2016 election—the authenticity of which are undisputed by the government—critically \nreferencing the work of Perkins Coie and its former employees involved in the representation of \nhis political opponent in the 2016 presidential campaign.  See id. ¶¶ 100-18, 124-25, 138; see also \n \n7   As of the date of this Memorandum Opinion, an appeal of this sanctions order against President Trump and \nhis counsel remains pending in the Eleventh Circuit.

For instance, on October 19, 2017, Trump tweeted, \n“Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th.  Who paid for it, \nRussia, the FBI, or the Dems (or all)?”  Manning Decl., Ex. 2, ECF No. 39-4 at 14.  In two tweets \nposted on August 6, 2018, Trump stated:  \n“Collusion with Russia was very real.  Hillary Clinton and her team 100% \ncolluded with the Russians, and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying \nto collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising \nmaterial on DJT.  We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through . . . a law \nfirm, eventually Kremlin connected sources, to gather info on Donald \nTrump.  Collusion is very real with Russia, but only with Hillary Clinton \nand the Democrats, and we should demand a full investigation.”  Dan \nBongino on @foxandfriends Looking forward to the new IG Report!   \n \nId., Ex. 3 (“August 6, 2018, Trump Tweets”), ECF No. 39-4 at 16 (ellipsis in original, denoting \nbreak between two tweets).  The demand for a “full investigation” could be read to cover plaintiff, \namong others.   \nPresident Trump’s statements and social media posts critical of Perkins Coie and its former \nlawyers, including Elias and Sussmann, continued in 2018.  For instance, on November 9, 2018, \nTrump, speaking about an ongoing recount in a U.S. Senate election in Florida, told reporters: \n[A]ll of a sudden, they’re finding votes out of nowhere.  And Rick Scott, \nwho won by – you know, it was close, but he won by a comfortable margin \n– every couple of hours it goes down a little bit.  And then you see the \npeople, and they were involved with that fraud of the fake dossier, the phony \ndossier.

How’s everything else \ndoing?  Enjoy your day!!! \n \nId., Ex. 10, ECF No. 39-4 at 56.  On December 11, 2022, Trump posted on Truth Social an article \ntitled “Elon Musk Calls Out Sussmann, Perkins Coie for ‘Attempt to Corrupt a Presidential \nElection.’”  Id., Ex. 12 (“December 11, 2022, Trump Post”), ECF No. 39-4 at 60.  On March 31, \n2024, Trump posted another article on Truth Social, this one titled “Marc Elias Is Scared…And \nHe Should Be.”  Id., Ex. 16 (“March 31, 2024, Trump Post”), ECF No. 39-4 at 69. \nOther posts have focused more generally on Perkins Coie.  On September 6, 2023, then-\ncandidate Trump posted on Truth Social: “They spied on my Campaign, Impeached me twice, had \nthe Russia, Russia Hoax, the Fake Dossier Hoax, FISA Fraud, Election Fraud, the ‘No Collusion’ \nMueller Hoax, and so much more.

Executive Order 14230  \nOn March 6, 2025, President Trump issued EO 14230, entitled “Addressing Risks from \nPerkins Coie LLP.”  90 Fed. Reg. at 11781.  In a televised signing ceremony, President Trump \nmade clear his reasons for the Executive Order, stating about Perkins Coie: “This is an absolute \nhonor to sign.  What they’ve done is, it’s just terrible.  It’s weaponization, you could say, \nweaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again.”  \nManning Decl., Ex. 29, CSPAN Video of President Trump Signing Executive Orders at 5:27-40, \nECF No. 39-4 at 133.

Section 1, titled \n“Purpose,” makes a number of purported derogatory factual findings about plaintiff’s conduct, \nusing such words as, in the first sentence, “dishonest and dangerous activity”; in the third sentence, \n“egregious activity”; in the fourth sentence, “unethical lack of candor”; in the fifth sentence, \naccusing the Firm of “racially discriminat[ing] against its own attorneys and staff, and against \napplicants,” which, in the tenth and last sentence, shows “disrespect for the bedrock principle of \nequality.”  Based on these findings, the last sentence of Section 1 states they “represent[] good \ncause to conclude that they neither have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible \nstewards of any Federal funds,” as directed in the instructions to all Executive branch agencies that \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 16 of 102\nfollow in the next sections of the Order.  EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781.  The government \nconfirms that these are a presidential “finding” and that “everything else in the executive order \nthat is being challenged, Sections 3 and . . . 5, fundamentally flow from that determination.”  Tr. \nof Mar. 12, 2025, Hr’g (“TRO Hr’g Tr.”) at 35:9-12, ECF No. 22; see also Tr. of Apr. 23, 2025, \nMots.

The first subsection \norders the immediate suspension of any active security clearances held by any Perkins Coie \nemployee “pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.”  \nEO 14230 § 2(a), 90 Fed.

Mots. \nHr’g Tr. at 24:13-14 (government counsel confirming “we would interpret it[] as being that \nbroad”).   \nThe second subsection of Section 2 orders the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) \nto “identify all Government goods, property, material, and services” currently provided “for the \nbenefit of Perkins Coie,” and then directs the heads of agencies to “expeditiously cease” such \nprovision.  EO 14230 § 2(b), 90 Fed.

Hr’g Tr. at 52:9-12; see also id. at 48:9-53:1, and, given the textual reference \nto plaintiff’s benefit, further limited to exclude the “types of goods and services . . . provided to \nthe public more generally,” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 11.  Whatever the merits of the government’s post \nhoc interpretive limitations on the scope of subsection (b), however, these limitations did not \nappear  in  OMB’s  implementation  directions  for  this  subsection.    OMB’s  March  7,  2025, \nMemorandum, sent to the heads of all executive departments and agencies, contained no text \nlimiting the scope of this subsection to “Government goods, property, material, and services” that \nwere national security-related or not otherwise provided to the public generally.

Reg. at 11782. \nThe first subsection instructs all agency “heads” to “provide guidance” on two action items: (1)  \n“limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Perkins Coie” when \n“such access would threaten the national security” or “be inconsistent with the interests of the \nUnited States,” and (2) “limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from \nengaging with Perkins Coie employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other \ninterests of the United States,” id. § 5(a).18  Government counsel resisted reading these limitations \n“as going, necessarily, as far as” disallowing the Firm’s employees from “even talk[ing] to or \nspeak[ing] with individuals,” and implied this was not such a big deal because, during COVID, \n“nobody was entering federal buildings; nobody was meeting; all access and all communications \nwere handled via letter, email, phone calls.”  TRO Hr’g Tr. at 55:15-22.  Given the breadth of the \nterm “engaging” used in Section 5 (a), however, he could not confirm that any one of these forms \nof communication with government officials would be permitted, since that is a decision left to the \ndiscretion of each agency head.

To the extent that references to \n“national security” and “national interest” guide the exercise of agency heads’ discretion, plaintiff \npointed out that “these agencies are already told what the outcome of their analysis is, because \nthey have been told in Section 1 that working with Perkins Coie is not consistent with the national \ninterest and not consistent with the administration and policies of this administration,” TRO Hr’g \n \n18   EO 14230 § 5(a) states in full: “The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide \nguidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Perkins Coie when such \naccess would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.

On March \n7,  2025,  the  day  after  issuance  of  EO  14230,  OMB  Director  Russell  Vought  sent  a \n“MEMORANDUM TO THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES” \nabout the Order’s implementation.  OMB Implementation Mem. (capitalization in original).  The \nmemorandum directed that, “[i]n accordance with the direction provided by the President” in EO \n14230, “[a]gencies must review all Government contracts and subcontracts with Perkins and Coie \nLLP, as well as provision to Perkins and Coie LLP of goods, property, material, and services, \nincluding  any  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facilities,”  which  review  should  be \ncompleted, and results reported back to OMB, by April 5, 2025.

In another pending case, an attorney in the Department of Justice’s Criminal \nFraud Section cancelled a previously scheduled meeting with Perkins Coie attorneys, citing the \nOrder.  Id. ¶ 162 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 45).  Then, on March 17, 2025, Perkins Coie received \nan 11-page letter from the Acting EEOC Chair expressing “concern,” based on “public statements \nand court filings,” that the Firm’s hiring practices “may entail unlawful disparate treatment . . . or \nunlawful  limiting,  segregating,  and  classifying  based  .  .  .  on  race,  sex,  or  other  protected \ncharacteristics, in violation of Title VII,” and requesting extensive information, dating back in \nsome instances for a decade, from the Firm about its hiring and promotion practices.

On the same day the Order was issued, one client, who had retained Perkins \nCoie for seven years and was represented by the Firm in seven open matters, “ended Perkins Coie’s \nrepresentation of that client in any litigation before the relevant federal agency.”  Id. ¶ 151 (citing \n2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 48).  Another client, for whom Perkins Coie had performed substantial work \ntotaling over $1 million in fees, hired another law firm when Perkins Coie lawyers were told they \ncould not attend a meeting to discuss the matter (discussed above).  Id. ¶ 152 (citing 2nd Burman \nDecl. ¶ 44).  On March 7, 2025, a major government contractor that Perkins Coie had represented \nfor 35 years hired other counsel for two pending matters.

The same day, plaintiff \n \n20   The government disputes this statement “as factual inference or conclusion,” Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF at \n5 (responding to ¶ 161), without explaining how the statements made by plaintiff’s declarant, a Firm partner  \nfamiliar with the “business and operations” of the firm, 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 1, including the impact on the Firm’s \nrevenue from client terminations occurring in the days immediately following the issuance of EO 14230, may be \ncriticized as based on “inference or conclusion,” rather than direct knowledge.  The government’s “dispute” rings \nhollow, particularly given (1) the temporal closeness in time between the issuance of EO 14230 and the client \nreactions, (2) the long-term relationships between plaintiff and the clients who terminated business with the law \nfirm, and (3) the Order’s terms, which were designed to hamper the effectiveness of plaintiff’s representation of \nclients before federal agencies, as discussed further infra in Part III.B.4.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 24 of 102\nmoved for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) as to only Sections 1, 3 and 5 of EO 14230, Pl.’s \nMot. for Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO Mot.”), ECF No. 2, and that motion was granted \nthe next day, on March 12, 2025, following a hearing, see Min.

Shortly after the hearing concluded, a written order granting the requested TRO as to EO \n14230’s Sections 1, 3 and 5, and explaining the injunction’s exact parameters was posted.  Order \n(“TRO Order”), ECF No. 21.  The parties were additionally directed to file a joint status report \nproposing a schedule to govern further proceedings in this case, and the government was directed \nto file a status report “describing the steps taken to ensure compliance with this Order and \ncertifying compliance with its requirements.”  Id. \nOn March 14, 2025, after the Court’s grant of the parties’ joint request for a one-day \nextension of time to file a proposed schedule, see Joint Mot. for Extension of Time, ECF No. 23; \nMin. Order (Mar. 13, 2025), the parties jointly proposed a schedule to move directly to an \nexpedited dispositive motions briefing, Joint Status Report ¶¶ 2-3, ECF No. 25.  The parties \nadditionally agreed to a stay of discovery, id. ¶ 4, and “to extend the Temporary Restraining Order \n. . . until final judgment,” id. ¶ 5.  In accord with the parties’ proposed schedule, the Court issued \nan order extending the temporary injunction “until final judgment is entered in this matter” and \nsetting a schedule to govern the briefing of expedited dispositive motions.  Order, ECF No. 26.  \nThat same day, the government submitted a status report describing initial steps taken to comply \nwith the TRO.  Gov’t’s Status Report, ECF No. 27.  A second status report outlining additional \nsteps taken by the government was filed on March 18, 2025.  Gov’t’s Status Report, ECF No. 29.   \nThe government’s second status report indicated that, while guidance was issued to all \nfederal agencies directing them to “suspend and rescind any implementation or enforcement of \nSections 1, 3, and 5 of Executive Order 14230, including any reliance on the statements in Section \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 25 of 102\n1 of the Executive Order,” id. ¶ 2, agencies had not been directed to take the additional required \nstep  of  immediately  communicating  “to  every  recipient  of  a  request  for  disclosure  of  any \nrelationship with Perkins Coie LLP or any person associated with the firm, made pursuant to \nSection 3(a) of Executive Order 14230, that such request is rescinded until further order of the \nCourt,” TRO Order at 2; see also Gov’t’s Status Report, ECF No. 29.  As a result, outstanding \ndisclosure requests to government contractors made by any federal agency other than the seven \nnamed government agencies in this lawsuit, remained in place notwithstanding the broader scope \nof the TRO requirement beyond merely those named defendants, based on the fact that the United \nStates was named as a defendant and defined, for purposes of the lawsuit, as constituting “all other \nagencies that are directed by [EO 14230] to take action respecting Perkins Coie.”  Compl. ¶ 36. \nThis shortcoming in implementing fully the TRO prompted plaintiff to seek clarification \nof the scope of the TRO, see Pl.’s Mot. to Clarify, ECF No. 30, and alert the Court to the \ngovernment’s more limited view of which federal agencies were subject to the TRO, with the \nconcomitant obligation to rescind disclosure requests to government contractors for information \nabout any business dealings with Perkins Coie.  This motion was granted the following day, and \nthe government was directed to provide an additional status report certifying compliance with the \nTRO, as clarified.  Min. Order (Mar. 19, 2025).  The government submitted two additional status \nreports regarding compliance with the TRO.  Gov’t’s Status Report, ECF No. 31; Gov’t’s Suppl. \nStatus Report, ECF No. 32.21  \n \n21   The government’s supplemental status report included as an attachment the guidance memorandum, dated \nMarch 20, 2025, sent by the Attorney General and OMB Director to all agencies, pursuant to the Court’s order \nclarifying the scope of the TRO. This second guidance memorandum, unlike the first guidance memorandum sent on \nMarch 18, 2025, included, for the first time, the following extra text: “The Executive Branch’s position is that \nExecutive Order 14230 is permissible, and that the Court’s order was erroneous. The government reserves the right \nto take all necessary and legal actions in response to the ‘dishonest and dangerous’ conduct of Perkins Coie LLP, as \nset forth in Executive Order 14230.”  Gov’t’s Suppl.

LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Motion to Dismiss \n1.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \n“‘Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,’ possessing ‘only that power authorized \nby the Constitution and statute.”  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 256 (2013) (quoting Kokkonen v. \nGuardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)).  Absent subject-matter jurisdiction over a case, \nthe court must dismiss it.  See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506-07 (2006) (citing \nKontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455 (2004)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the plaintiff \nbears the burden of demonstrating the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim at issue.  \n \n23   In addition to the parties’ voluminous submissions, twenty-two amicus briefs have been submitted in \nsupport of plaintiff from a wide range of interested lawyers and law firms; legal professional organizations; law \nprofessors; 346 former state and federal judges; former and current in-house general counsel; former senior \ngovernment officials; media and press freedom organizations; and organizations including the ACLU, Cato Institute, \nInstitute for Justice, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the \nPress, among others.  A single amicus brief was submitted in support of the government by three gun rights groups \nand three conservative advocacy organizations.  See Br. Amicus Curiae of America’s Future, Gun Owners of \nAmerica, Gun Owners Foundation, Gun Owners of California, Judicial Action Group, & Conservative Legal \nDefense & Education Fund in Supp. of Recons. of the TRO & Gov’t’s MTD (“Br. of America’s Future et al.”), ECF \nNo. 131 (beginning with four Bible verses at the top of the Table of Authorities, see id. at iii, and arguing for \nexpansive Executive Power, while noting the total number of votes and Electoral College margin in favor of \nPresident Trump, id. at 23, and listing the injunctions issued by federal courts against the current Trump \nAdministration’s actions, see id. App. 1). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 28 of 102\nArpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 561 (1992)).  When reviewing such a motion, the court must “assume that the complaint states \na valid legal claim,” Huron v. Cobert, 809 F.3d 1274, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 2016), and “accept the well-\npleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in the \nplaintiff’s favor,” Kareem v. Haspel, 986 F.3d 859, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (quoting Arpaio, 797 \nF.3d at 19).  The court may also “consider materials outside the pleadings to determine [its] \njurisdiction.”  Id. at 856 n.7; see also West v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 1228, 1231 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (“As \nnecessary, [a court may] cull additional facts from other parts of the record.” (citing Settles v. U.S. \nParole Comm’n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2005))). \n2.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 12(b)(6) \nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a complaint contain a short \nand plain statement of the grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depends, a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and a demand for judgment for \nthe relief the pleader seeks.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).  This rule “does not require detailed factual \nallegations,  but  it  demands  more  than  an  unadorned,  the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me \naccusation.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quotations omitted).  In addition, Rule \n8(d) states  that  “[e]ach  allegation  must  be  simple,  concise,  and  direct.”   Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n8(d)(1).  “Taken together, [those provisions] underscore the emphasis placed on clarity and brevity \nby the federal pleading rules,” Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 669 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (cleaned up), \nand to “give the defendants fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it \nrests,” Jones  v.  Kirchner,  835  F.3d  74,  79  (D.C.  Cir.  2016).    The  purposes  of  Rule \n8(a)(2) and Rule 12(b)(6) overlap, but dismissal is proper under Rule 8 when the complaint is “so \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 29 of 102\nconfused, ambiguous, vague, or otherwise unintelligible” that a defendant cannot discern the \nplaintiff's claims. Ciralsky, 355 F.3d at 670 n.9.  \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the “complaint must contain sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A facially plausible \nclaim pleads facts that are not “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability” but “that allow[] \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nId. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57).  In deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), a court \nmust accept all factual allegations as true, “even if doubtful in fact,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, \nand “construe the complaint ‘in favor of the plaintiff,’” Langeman v. Garland, 88 F.4th 289, 294 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Hettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d 471, 476 (D.C. Cir. 2012)).  Courts, \nhowever, “need not accept inferences . . . not supported by the facts set out in the complaint, nor \nmust the court accept legal conclusions.”  Id. (quoting Hettinga, 677 F.4th at 476).  In determining \nwhether a complaint fails to state a claim, a court may consider only the facts alleged in the \ncomplaint and “any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint,” as well as \n“matters of which the court may take judicial notice.”  N. Am. Butterfly Ass’n v. Wolf, 977 F.3d \n1244, 1249 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (alterations in original accepted, citation omitted).  \nB.  Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment shall be granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a).  Facts are only “‘material’ if a dispute over it might affect the outcome of a suit under the \ngoverning law,” meaning that “factual disputes that are ‘irrelevant or unnecessary’ do not affect \nthe summary judgment determination.”  Mayorga v. Merdon, 928 F.3d 84, 89 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 30 of 102\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986))).  A dispute is only “genuine” if “the evidence is such that \na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Thus, \n“[i]n considering a motion for summary judgment, judges must ask themselves not whether they \nthink ‘the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a fair-minded jury could \nreturn a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented,’ because that evidence is such that “the \njury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.”  Stoe v. Barr, 960 F.3d 627, 638-39 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nPlaintiff advances four overarching and successful constitutional challenges to Sections 1 \nthrough 5 of EO 14230, due to the collective import and impact of its purposes, findings and \ninstructions to all Executive branch agencies.  Specifically, the Complaint claims the Executive \nOrder (1) violates the First Amendment rights of Perkins Coie and the Firm’s clients due to \nunlawful retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, and compelled disclosures, Pl.’s Mem. at 10-21; \nsee also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 126-56 (Counts V, VI, VII); (2) violates Perkins Coie’s rights to due \nprocess of law under the Fifth Amendment, Pl.’s Mem. at 21-27; see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 99-116 \n(Counts II and III); (3) violates the Firm’s clients’ right to counsel under the Fifth and Sixth \nAmendments, Pl.’s Mem. at 27-31; see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 157-68 (Counts VIII and IX); and (4) \nunconstitutionally denies equal protection of the law to Perkins Coie by singling the firm out for \nunfair treatment, Pl.’s Mem. at 37-38; see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 117-25 (Count IV).24  Plaintiff \nadditionally argues that each of the factors for permanent injunctive relief has been satisfied and \n \n24   Plaintiff also claims that EO 14230 exceeds the President’s constitutional and statutory authority and \ntherefore violates the Constitution’s separation of powers, Pl.’s Mem. at 31-36; see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 85-98 \n(Count I), but this claim, as noted supra n.5, is not addressed. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 31 of 102\nSections 1 through 5 of EO 14230 should therefore be permanently enjoined.  Pl.’s Mem. at 38-\n45. \nThe government, meanwhile, seeks dismissal of all nine counts of plaintiff’s complaint, on \nvarious grounds, predicated on the view that “[t]he law does not support Plaintiff’s claims as to \nSections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; and as to Section 5 specifically, Plaintiff’s claim is at best too early and, \nas any guidance will be consistent with the law, will eventually fail on the merits.”  Gov’t’s Mem. \nat 3.  In so moving, the government confusingly reads the nine counts in plaintiff’s complaint as \neach challenging separate sections of EO 14230, see, e.g., id. at 8 (asserting that “[o]nly Counts II \nand III . . . actually challenge Section 1” of the Order); Gov’t’s Opp’n at 3-4, and, on this basis, \ncritiques the complaint as being “imprecise” and “severely handicap[ping] [its] and the Court’s \nability to ascertain the particulars of Plaintiff’s challenges to the various sections of the Executive \nOrder, including which allegations and claims in the Complaint pertain to which sections of the \nExecutive Order.”  Gov’t’s Mem. at 3.25  This reading of the Amended Complaint, however, is \nerroneous.  Seven of its nine counts plainly challenge, collectively, all sections of EO 14230 as \nunlawful.  See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 101 (claiming, in Count II, that “[t]he Order interferes with . . . \nmultiple . . . interests protected by the Due Process Clause”); id. ¶ 108 (claiming, in Count III, that \n“[t]he Order is unconstitutionally vague”); id. ¶ 124 (claiming, in Count IV, that “[t]he Order is . . \n. in violation of the Equal Protection Clause”); id. ¶ 128 (claiming, in Count V, that “[t]he Order . \n. . constitute[s] viewpoint discrimination”); id. ¶ 155 (claiming, in Count VII, that “[t]he Order . . \n. violates the First Amendment”); id. ¶ 160 (claiming, in Count VIII, “[t]he Order” violates “the \n \n25   This critique of plaintiff’s complaint is somewhat ironic given the government’s lack of clarity in \nidentifying the specific grounds relied upon in seeking dismissal of the claims, compounded by the government’s \nfailure to comply with applicable procedural rules in bringing a cross-motion for summary judgment.  See infra \nn.26. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 32 of 102\nfirm’s clients’ Sixth Amendment rights to counsel”); id. ¶ 168 (claiming, in Count IX, “[t]he \nOrder[] violat[e]s” the Fifth Amendment right to counsel).  In the remaining two counts, plaintiff \nalso clearly identifies the sections subjected to challenge.  See id. ¶ 142 (claiming, in Count VI, \nthat “Section 3 of the Order is facially unconstitutional”); Pl.’s Mem. at 31 (indicating that Count \nI challenges “Sections 1, 2(b), 3, and 5”). \nThe government’s motion to dismiss is addressed first before turning to plaintiff’s motion \nfor summary judgment. \nA.  The Government’s Motion to Dismiss \nThe government argues that all plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed for multiple alleged \ndeficiencies, which are discussed in the government’s supporting memorandum by reviewing EO \n14230 on a section-by-section basis.26  None of these arguments are persuasive.  While the \ngovernment organizes its briefing in a manner designed to mount a forceful defense of each section \nof the Order, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) guides the assertion of defenses to “claim[s] \nfor relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (emphasis supplied), as plaintiff correctly points out, see Pl.’s \nOpp’n at 5.  Thus, the normal form of analysis of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) requires \nreview of each claim asserted to assess its sufficiency, but this is not how the government presented \nits arguments.  To reduce redundancy, the sufficiency of each claim is considered as part of \nassessing whether plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the claims, in Part III.B.  The \n \n26   Neither the government’s motion to dismiss itself or its proposed order cites to any procedural rule as the \nbasis for the requested dismissal, see Gov’t’s MTD; id., Proposed Order, ECF No. 43-2), and the government’s \nmemorandum in support likewise contains no clear statement of the procedural rules relied upon as to each claim, \nleaving the legal bases for the motion to the Court to discern from vague headings used in the government’s \nmemorandum or to tease out of the text of the same document, despite the critical differences in applicable standards \ndepending on which rule is relied upon.  Regardless of whether this reflects a strategy to “disguise[] the nature of its \nmotion,” Pl.’s Opp’n at 5, plaintiff requests denial of any intended government cross-motion for summary judgment \n“for failure to comply with [D.D.C.] Local Rule 7(h)(1), which requires a statement of undisputed material facts \nsupported by record citations,” id.  This basis for denial urged by plaintiff need not be resolved since the pending \nmotions are resolved on alternative grounds.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 33 of 102\ngeneral arguments raised by the government’s motion to dismiss—which arguments are only \nloosely tied, if at all, to specific procedural rules to test the sufficiency of the claims as pleaded—\nare addressed in this Part.  \n1.  Plaintiff Contests Purported Findings in EO 14230’s Section 1. \nThe government blithely describes the statements set out in Section 1 of EO 14230 as “not \nseriously contested” and “matters of public record.”  Gov’t’s Mem. at 7.  This description is \ninaccurate.    Plaintiff  “vigorously  contests”  Section  1’s  allegations  of  racial  discrimination \nthroughout the complaint.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 2; see, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 45 (stating that Plaintiff “does \nnot, and did not” racially discriminate against its employees); id. ¶ 46 (contesting Section 1’s “false \npremise” that “promoting diversity in the legal profession” equates to illegal discrimination); id. \n¶ 51 (calling Section 1’s allegations “false and disparaging”).   \nMoreover, to the extent that certain factual matters alluded to in Section 1 are not contested, \nsee, e.g., Pl.’s SMF ¶ 83 (acknowledging three former Perkins Coie lawyers were sanctioned, in \n2021, a total of $8,700 resulting from a duplicative motion filed in a voting rights appeal), plaintiff \ndoes challenge the use of these statements as a basis for the government actions directed in EO \n14230, see, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (challenging the Order as “not executive in nature,” id. ¶ 2, \nand stating that “[t]he principal claims made by the Order have already been raised in the proper \nforum and resolved by the branch of government with constitutional authority to do so,” id. ¶ 8); \nPl.’s Mem. at 35 (arguing the Order impermissibly invades the judicial function, “given that federal \ncourts already have adjudicated many of the President’s grievances referenced in the Order”).   \nThe thrust of the government’s inaccurate characterization of Section 1’s statements as \n“undisputed” appears to be that these statements are immune from, or would survive, any factual \nor legal claims asserted by plaintiff, and therefore Section 1 must withstand any challenge lodged \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 34 of 102\nby plaintiff on any constitutional basis. This defense falls short on both procedural and legal \ngrounds. As a factual matter, in the procedural posture of a motion to dismiss, the amended \ncomplaint’s allegations firmly disputing the veracity of the Section 1 statements are assumed to be \ntrue and any factual disputes may not be resolved on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  \nSee supra Part II.A.2.  As a legal matter, Section 1’s statements setting out the “Purpose” of the \nOrder are highly probative of the sufficiency of the claims of constitutional violations, as discussed \nmore fully infra in Part III.B.1, and thus may certainly not be accepted as appropriate, let alone \n“straightforwardly legal,” as the government urges, Gov’t’s Mem. at 1. \n2.  EO 14230’s Section 1 Operates as Actionable Findings. \nDiscounting EO 14230’s Section 1 as merely a “preamble,” rather than an “operative \nsection[],” Gov’t’s Mem. at 1, the government contends that Section 1’s statements “lay[] out the \nPresident’s concerns about the law firm Perkins Coie,” id.  As such, the government argues that, \nthough plaintiff “does not like what the current Administration thinks about Plaintiff,” id. at 13, \nthe Firm may not “muzzl[e],” id. at 1, or “silence the Government’s own opinions,” id. at 13.  On \nthis basis, the government seeks dismissal of any of plaintiff’s claims challenging Section 1.  See \nGov’t’s Mem. at 13 (“Plaintiff has no right to silence the Government’s own opinions.  Plaintiff’s \nclaims asking this Court to do just that should be dismissed.”).  \nThe government’s argument suggests that to the extent the Section 1 statements amount \nmerely to President Trump’s protected speech, at least that section (and potentially the full Order) \nmay not be enjoined.  See id.; Gov’t’s Opp’n at 6-8; Gov’t’s Reply at 2-3.  Not so.  While \ngovernment officials may, under the First Amendment, “share [their] views freely and criticize \nparticular beliefs,” they may not “use the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored \nexpression.”  Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188; see infra Part III.B.1. (addressing plaintiff’s viewpoint \ndiscrimination and retaliation claim).  Courts may, therefore, properly “scrutinize” cases where \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 35 of 102\n“the application of state power” is called into question.  Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188 (quoting NAACP \nv. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 463 (1958)).    \nThe government’s attempt to reframe this case as about governmental speech is subterfuge.  \nPlaintiff has not sued at any point over the last almost decade when President Trump, either when \nserving in an official role as President or as a private citizen and political candidate, made \nderogatory statements about the Firm and its current or former employees.  Exactly the opposite: \nthen-former President Trump sued plaintiff, among others, for some of the same conduct described \nin the Section 1 statements, and plaintiff prevailed in that suit.  See supra n.7 and associated text.  \nThe claims that the government seeks to dismiss in this lawsuit challenge the use of governmental \npower, not governmental speech.  More specifically, plaintiff seeks to enjoin the use of the Section \n1 statements by executive branch actors to justify adverse actions toward plaintiff, on grounds that \nactions based on those statements would constitute unlawful retaliation and other violations of \nplaintiff’s and its clients’ constitutional rights.  See TRO Hr’g Tr. at 9:17-20 (plaintiff’s counsel \nexpressly  stating  that  plaintiff  sought  “instruction  to  departments,  agenc[ies],  and  the \nadministration that they are not to use Section 1’s findings as a direction for any interactions with \nPerkins Coie”); see also id. at 8:6-9:1.  \nIndeed, the government acknowledges that Section 1’s statements are more than mere \ngovernmental speech and form the basis for the Order’s “Purpose” and amount to findings by \nPresident Trump that guide implementation of the instructions that follow.  See TRO Hr’g Tr. at \n48:7-11 (government counsel confirming Section 1’s statements are “finding[s]”; id. at 48:12-\n49:21 (government counsel indicating that the President had the power to make such findings and \nto direct resulting actions); Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 38:14-24 (government counsel conceding that the \nfindings in Section 1 inform the determination of the “national interest”); Gov’t’s Mem. at 7 \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 36 of 102\n(describing Section 1 as “a brief factual explanation for the operational elements of the Executive \nOrder”); Manning Decl., Ex. 55, Tr. of Mar. 28, 2025, Mot. Hr’g at 20:6-9, Jenner & Block LLP \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 25-cv-916, ECF No. 10 (D.D.C.), ECF No. 39-4 at 610 (government \ncounsel acknowledging, in a case involving a similar EO targeting Jenner & Block LLP, that “any \nmember of the Executive . . . wrestling with how to implement [the EO] . . . would necessarily be \nresorting and looking at what was said in Section 1 to guide that decision”).  The text of EO 14230 \nmakes this explicit, stating that the Section 1 statements provide “good cause to conclude that” \nplaintiff should “neither have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards \nof any Federal funds,” EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, which conclusions are effectuated \nby the subsequent instructions in the Order, id. §§ 2-5, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781-82. \nThe TRO issued by this Court carefully skirted the President’s own free speech rights and \nneither treaded on those rights nor enjoined the President from making statements.  Instead, the \nTRO enjoined the government from “using the statements” against plaintiff, plaintiff’s employees, \nor plaintiff’s clients or their employees.  TRO Order at 1 (emphasis supplied).  Put another way, \nplaintiff does not challenge “what the current Administration thinks about Plaintiff,” Gov’t’s Mem. \nat 13, but rather what the current Administration seeks to do to plaintiff based on that thinking. \nPlaintiff does not seek, nor would this Court grant, an injunction to prevent President \nTrump from “shar[ing] [his] views” or “criticiz[ing] particular beliefs.”  Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188.  \nAt the same time, however, plaintiff may challenge “the application of state power” against \nplaintiff, id. (quoting Patterson, 357 U.S. at 463), based on statements qualifying as “findings” \nused to justify an order with which Executive branch agencies must comply.          \n3.  Plaintiff’s Challenges to EO 14230’s Section 2 Are Justiciable. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 37 of 102\nEO 14230’s Section 2(a) directs all “relevant heads of executive departments and agencies” \n“immediately  [to]  take  steps  consistent  with  applicable  law  to  suspend  any  active  security \nclearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are \nconsistent with the national interest.”  EO 14230 § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781.  The government \nacknowledges that this suspension, by its terms, applies to all of plaintiff’s employees, lawyers \nand non-lawyers, regardless of their role at the Firm, the reason for grant or use of the clearance, \nor any other individual characteristics, such as the employee’s former or current military service.  \nMots. Hr’g Tr. at 23:22-24:14; see also 2nd Burman Decl. ¶¶ 36, 38 (explaining that two current \nFirm employees currently serve in the military reserves and “hold clearances in connection with \ntheir duties as military reservists” and twelve hold clearances due to “former military or other \npublic service backgrounds”).  In the government’s view, this section of the Order is “not judicially \nreviewable,” in light of “governing D.C. Circuit precedent,” and thus requires dismissal of \nplaintiff’s claims challenging Section 2.  Gov’t’s Mem. at 14 (citing Lee v. Garland, 120 F.4th 880 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024)).  The government’s argument, however, overreads Lee and ignores other \nprecedents that lead to the opposite conclusion. \nIn  Lee,  the  D.C.  Circuit  considered  whether  courts  are  barred  “from  considering \nconstitutional challenges to adverse clearance decisions.”  120 F.4th at 887.  The analysis \nexamined the nature of decisions on individual security clearance applications, which require the \nweighing of “intangible qualities such as ‘loyalty to the United States, strength of character, \ntrustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment,’” id. at 893 (quoting Exec. \nOrder  No.  12968,  60  Fed.  Reg.  40245,  40250  (Aug.  2,  1995)),  and  exercising  “predictive \njudgment” about the individual’s ability to safeguard sensitive information, id. (quoting Dep’t of \nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988)).  These determinations, the Circuit explained, are “an \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 38 of 102\ninexact science at best,” requiring a “judgment call” made by experts, and thus are “committed to \nthe broad discretion of the agency responsible.”  Id. (quoting Egan, 484 U.S. at 528-29).  Invoking \nthe Supreme Court’s holdings in Egan that “it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert \nbody to review the substance of such a judgment and . . . decide whether the agency should have \nbeen  able  to  make  the  necessary  affirmative  prediction  with  confidence,”  nor  possible  for \nnonexperts to “determine what constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential \nrisk,” Egan, 484 U.S. at 529, the Circuit held that courts may not consider constitutional challenges \nto “Executive Branch decision[s] to deny or revoke a security clearance” of an individual, Lee, \n120 F.4th at 891.    \nImportantly, the Lee decision did not disturb prior D.C. Circuit holdings making expressly \nclear that “[i]t is simply not the case that all security-clearance decisions are immune from judicial \nreview.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Fed. Emps. v. Greenberg, 983 F.2d 286, 289 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  While \n“discretionary judgments regarding a particular employee’s security clearance” are unreviewable, \nexamples of reviewable decisions include “the constitutionality of the methods” used to collect \ninformation and make the required determinations.  Id. at 290.  Other Supreme Court and D.C. \nCircuit opinions confirm that judicial review is available for claims that a general discriminatory \npolicy governing security clearances exists.  See, e.g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 602 (1988) \n(differentiating between a claim that a respondent was terminated “based on his homosexuality” \nand a claim “that a more pervasive discrimination policy exists . . . regarding all homosexuals” \n(emphasis in original)); Doe v. Gates, 981 F.2d 1316, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (assuming, on remand \nin the same case, that a “blanket policy against homosexuals” would be unconstitutional); Gill v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 875 F.3d 677, 685 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Tatel, J., concurring) (“In my view, if \n[appellant] could show that the government has a policy or practice of treating Muslims or \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 39 of 102\nnaturalized citizens differently, his equal protection claims, like the claims at issue in Greenberg, \nwould not be barred by Egan.” (emphasis supplied)). \nConsidering the fuller context of binding precedents and where Lee fits comfortably within \nthis jurisprudence, judicial review of the Order’s Section 2(a) is available in the instant case for at \nleast four reasons.  First, plaintiff seeks judicial review not of any individual security clearance \ndecision, but of a publicly announced general policy governing security clearances for any member \nof a class of people—here, the class consists of employees of plaintiff—which policy plaintiff \nalleges is constitutionally suspect on multiple bases.  This is directly analogous to seeking review \nof an alleged “discrimination policy,” Webster, 486 U.S. at 602, not based on any individualized \nassessments of any of the employees to whom the suspension applies.  Lee addressed only a \nchallenge to an individual “denial or revocation of security clearances,” 120 F.4th at 887, and does \nnot foreclose review of challenges to general policies governing security clearances.  Both Webster \nand Doe confirm that review of the latter types of claims is proper.  \nSecond,  because  plaintiff  challenges  a  general  policy  rather  than  an  individual \ndetermination, judicial review would not require a court to wade into the issues animating the \ndecision in Lee.  For example, review of EO 14230 or similar general policies on the record here \ndoes not require an examination of any of the “intangible qualities” weighed in individual \nclearance decisions, Lee, 120 F.4th at 893; or second-guessing any of the “predictive judgment[s]” \nor “judgment call[s],” id. (quoting Egan, 484 U.S. at 529), of the security clearance experts; or \nmaking any risk assessments, see Egan, 484 U.S. at 529.  The D.C. Circuit made a similar \nobservation in Rattigan v. Holder, 689 F.3d 764, 767-68 (D.C. Cir. 2012), where the Circuit held \nthat judicial review is only barred when “security clearance-related decisions made by trained \nSecurity Division personnel” are at issue, since these decisions involve “sensitive, predictive \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 40 of 102\njudgments,” but is not absolutely barred as to decisions made by other employees who do not make \nthese types of expert judgments.   \nThird, related to the second reason, each case relied upon by the government in which the \nchallenged individual security clearance decision was found to be non-justiciable involved a \nchallenge to an individualized process conducted by expert agency examiners that included \nconsideration of articulable findings directly pertinent to the individual with the clearance.  In Lee, \nfor  instance,  the  plaintiff  challenged  the  results  of  three  specific  polygraph  examinations \nperformed by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the failure of which examinations led \nto the revocation of his clearance.  120 F.4th at 884-85.  After failing the first two exams and \nhaving his clearance revoked on that basis, he appealed this adverse decision to an expert body at \nDOJ, which ordered him to sit for a third exam.  Id.  After failing the third exam, he was fired.  Id. \nat 885.  Similarly, in Egan, a laborer at a naval facility in Washington state was denied a clearance \nand subsequently fired due to his undisclosed prior criminal convictions and his statements \nacknowledging past alcohol abuse.  484 U.S. at 520-21.  The respondent in that case was given a \nchance to respond, and favorable material he provided was weighed by the experts against the \nmaterial they had deemed unfavorable.  Id. at 521-22.  After an unsuccessful appeal of this \ndecision, the respondent was removed from the job.  Id. at 522.   \nThe decisions in Lee and Egan are easily reconciled with those in Webster, Greenberg, and \nRattigan.  Where individual decisions are made by experts based on information specific to the \nindividual, such as the results of polygraph examinations, see Lee, 120 F.4th at 884-85, or the \nweighing of both specific negative and favorable information about an individual, see Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 521, courts have no basis on which to redo the analysis or second-guess the decisions, see, \ne.g., Lee, 120 F.4th at 893 (explaining that review in such cases would “present . . . unmanageable \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 41 of 102\nquestions” to courts).  In circumstances like the instant case, however, no such process or apparent \nexpertise was involved, and where the allegation is that a pervasive, class-wide discriminatory \npolicy exists against some group of individuals, the questions involved do not create any need for \ncourts to second-guess experts or weigh unmanageable standards. \nFinally, and notably, Section 2(a) never invokes national security as the reason, or even \none of multiple reasons, for the specific action directed to suspend and review security clearances \nheld by plaintiff’s employees.  See generally EO 14230 § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781 (citing \nsuspension “pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest” \nonly (emphasis supplied)).  When the government does not even claim that a general policy about \nsecurity clearances was motivated by national security, judicial review of that policy could not \nthreaten unduly entangling the judicial branch in questions of national security.  Instead, the EO \ninvokes “the national interest,” id., a concept seemingly far broader and more nebulous than threats \nto national security.  When asked, government counsel was unable to define what exactly falls \nwithin the scope of “the national interest,” see, e.g., TRO Hr’g Tr. at 52:21-53:4, and the scope \nappears to be essentially unlimited, since disagreements about the benefits of diversity programs \nin hiring apparently qualify, see EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781 (stating that plaintiff’s \nalleged discrimination “represents good cause to conclude that they [should not] have access to \nour  Nation’s  secrets”);  Gov’t’s  Reply  at  1  (complaining  about  plaintiff’s  “aggressive  DEI \npractices”).  Finding any such government actions judicially unreviewable simply because the \nExecutive branch invoked “the national interest” would represent a breathtaking expansion of \nexecutive power at the expense of the constitutionally mandated role of the judicial branch and the \nconcomitant safeguards for the individual rights of Americans. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 42 of 102\nIn sum, here, the issues on which plaintiff seeks judicial review are appropriate for the \ncourts.    Evaluating  plaintiff’s  challenge  requires  only  the  application  of  longstanding  legal \nprinciples and constitutional interpretation—“the heartland of the judicial ken.”  J.G.G. v. Trump, \nNo. 25-5067, 2025 WL 914682, at *6 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (Henderson, J., concurring).  For \ninstance, to resolve the claim that the suspension of, and announcement of an investigation into, \nall clearances held by plaintiff’s employees is unconstitutional retaliation for First Amendment \nactivity, see infra Part III.B.1, the Court need only apply the test long articulated by the Supreme \nCourt, asking first whether the “adverse action . . . [was] based on [a] forbidden motive,” Nieves \nv. Bartlett, 587 U.S. 391, 398 (2019), and second, whether any claimed “non-retaliatory grounds \n[were] in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences,” id. (quoting Hartman v. Moore, \n547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006)).  The same is true for plaintiff’s claim of viewpoint discrimination.  See, \ne.g., Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188 (stating that a government official “cannot . . . use the power of the \nState to punish or suppress disfavored expression”).  As plaintiff persuasively argues, such \nquestions “‘sound[] in familiar principles of constitutional interpretation’ and can be answered \nthrough ordinary judicial tools.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 16 (quoting Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, \n201 (2012)).   \nCertainly, substantial discretion is given to the Executive branch in matters of national \nsecurity.  See, e.g., Lee, 120 F.4th at 891.  Yet, this authority, “like every other governmental \npower, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution.”  \nDames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 661 (1981) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright \nExport Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319-20 (1936)).  While the President may have the discretion to make \nsubstantive decisions on individual security clearances, see generally Lee, 120 F.4th 880, he may \nnot apply a discriminatory policy to a group of individuals during the process of making such \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 43 of 102\ndecisions, see Greenberg, 983 F.2d at 290, as plaintiff alleges occurred in the instant case.  Since \nthe questions raised in this case are proper for judicial review and determination, without requiring \nreview of the sensitive individual determinations left to the Executive branch, the government’s \nblanket demand for dismissal of plaintiff’s challenges to EO 14230’s Section 2 for lack of \njusticiability fails.  \nThe government also lodges a last gasp basis to dismiss plaintiff’s challenge to Section 2 \nas  “not  ripe”  and  “premature  for  judicial  consideration”  because  the  clearances  have  been \nsuspended pending “a further security clearance determination.”  Gov’t’s Mem. at 16.  This basis \nfor dismissal also fails.  Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint describes the actions already effectuated \nby EO 14230, including, for example, the “Order’s threatened suspension of active security \nclearances held by Perkins Coie employees because the firm embraces programs and policies that \nespouse a belief in ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ makes it a violation of the firm’s First \nAmendment right of free expression.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 149 (emphasis supplied).  Such explicit \nthreats tied to continuation of specified speech are not a speculative future harm.  As the Supreme \nCourt has held, “threat[s] of . . . coercion” intended “‘to achieve the suppression’ of disfavored \nspeech” are sufficient to “violate[] the First Amendment.”  Vullo, 602 U.S. at 180 (quoting Bantam \nBooks, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 67 (1963)).  The question presented here, whether the actions \nalready taken in this case amount to such threats, is a “purely legal” issue that “will not be clarified \nby further factual development,” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 167 (2014) \n(quoting Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 581 (1985)), since the ultimate \noutcome of any “review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest,” EO \n14230 Sec. 2(a)—whatever such “national interest” means—has no bearing on whether the threat \nof suspension and review made by the EO constitutes unlawful retaliation.   \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 44 of 102\n4.  Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge EO 14230’s Section 3. \nThe government contends that plaintiff lacks standing to assert any claim challenging EO \n14230’s Section 3, which directs all “Government contracting agencies” to “require Government \ncontractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related \nto the subject of the Government contract.”  EO 14230 § 3(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781; see Gov’t’s \nMem. at 19-21.  By its terms, the required disclosures include all business with Perkins Coie, \nwhether relating to a federal government contract or not.  This section further requires the “heads \nof all agencies” to “take appropriate steps to terminate any contract . . . for which Perkins Coie has \nbeen hired to perform any service,” id. § 3(b)(i), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782, and to “otherwise align \ntheir . . . funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States” and “the goals \nand priorities” of the Trump Administration “as expressed in executive actions,” id. § 3(b)(ii).  In \ncase the implications of that somewhat murky language are unclear, the accompanying fact sheet \nhelpfully clarifies the issue: “the Federal Government will prohibit funding contractors that use \nPerkins Coie LLP.”  EO 14230 Fact Sheet.   \n The government seeks dismissal of any claim challenging Section 3 on the ground that \nplaintiff failed to allege any injury traceable to this section by not specifically alleging being party \nto any government contract or currently performing work on any government contract.  See Gov’t’s \nMem. at 19-21.  This argument simultaneously misrepresents the scope of Section 3 and misreads \nplaintiff’s complaint, and thus may be easily dispatched.  Whether plaintiff itself is directly a \nsignatory to a federal government contract is immaterial if plaintiff sufficiently pleads injury-in-\nfact traceable to Section 3 and redressable by the injunctive relief requested by performing work \nfor clients holding or seeking to hold federal government contracts.  The Amended Complaint \namply alleges facts to satisfy these standing prerequisites. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 45 of 102\nIn response to the Order’s directives, for example, the Amended Complaint alleges that \n“several  clients  have  already  terminated,  or  have  communicated  that  they  are  considering \nterminating, their legal engagements with Perkins Coie” “[b]ecause of the Order . . . and risk of \ncontract termination faced by clients with government contracts.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 70 (emphasis \nsupplied).  The complaint further alleges that, in the short time between the issuance of the Order \nand the Court’s TRO, some of the firm’s clients “reported [receiving] very concerning messages \nfrom government officials directing them to report business with Perkins Coie, and others are \nconcerned about that possibility.”  Id.  These allegations plainly plead injuries directly traceable \nto Section 3 and thus establish plaintiff’s standing to challenge the constitutionality of this \nprovision. \n5.  Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge EO 14230’s Section 4. \nThe government also attacks plaintiff’s standing to challenge Section 4, contending that \nplaintiff cannot trace any alleged injury from the EEOC’s review of plaintiff to EO 14230’s Section \n4, since the directed “‘review’ and ‘investigat[ion]’ of ‘the practices of representative large, \ninfluential, or industry leading law firms’ for consistency with civil rights laws, Gov’t’s Mem. at \n26 (alteration in original) (quoting EO 14230 § 4(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782), is “already what the \nEEOC is supposed to be doing,” id. (emphasis in original).  To bolster this argument, the \ngovernment cites Executive Order 14173, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring \nMerit-Based Opportunity,” 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025) (“Anti-DEI EO”), issued on \nPresident Trump’s second day in office.  This Anti-DEI EO directs, among other actions, federal \nagencies to “enforce civil rights laws and combat illegal private-sector DEI policies and practices.”  \nGov’t’s Mem. at 27 (citing EO 14173 §§ 2, 4(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 8633, 8635).  According to the \ngovernment, these already-existing requirements mean plaintiff cannot show that the “alleged \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 46 of 102\nretaliatory action[] ‘would not have been taken absent the alleged retaliatory motive.”   Id. \n(alteration accepted) (quoting Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys. v. Wilson, 595 U.S. 468, 477 (2022)).  \nThe government’s reasoning that the Anti-DEI EO breaks the traceability of any harm from \nchallenged Section 4, thereby obviating plaintiff’s standing to bring a challenge to EO 14230’s \nSection 4, proves too much and only highlights the logical fallacy in the government’s argument.  \nAs plaintiff points out, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 17-18, the fact that the EEOC may already have the \nstatutory authorization and presidential mandate to conduct investigations, report to the President, \nand file charges, Gov’t’s Mem. at 26-27 (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-5(a), -4(e), -5(b), and Anti-\nDEI EO), makes Section 4 “at most redundant, except insofar as it singles out [plaintiff] for \nopprobrium and punishment by all federal agencies,” Pl.’s Opp’n at 18.  Section 4 focuses the \nEEOC on “representative large, influential, or industry leading law firms,” without expressly \nnaming plaintiff, but the inclusion of this direction in an Order explicitly targeting plaintiff speaks \nvolumes.  In addition, the match-up in Section 1’s statements critiquing plaintiff’s hiring and \npromotion practices and Section 4’s descriptions of the “large” law firm practices the EEOC is \ndirected to review, leaves little doubt that plaintiff is included on the EEOC’s targeted law firm \nlist.  The government concedes as much.  Gov’t’s Mem. at 2 (“Section 4 directs the Attorney \nGeneral and the Chair of the [EEOC] to review whether Perkins Coie and like employers are \nviolating the civil rights laws.”). \nThe government further defends Section 4 on grounds that “[t]he EEOC is already required \nto make ‘report[s] . . . to the President . . . on the cause of and means of eliminating discrimination,’ \nincluding in any industry the President directs the EEOC to review.”  Gov’t’s Mem. at 26 (citing \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-4(e), titled “Reports to Congress and the President,” that provides only for the \nEEOC  to:  (1)  report  annually  “concerning  the  action  it  has  taken  and  the  moneys  it  has \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 47 of 102\ndisbursed[,]” and (2) “make such further reports on the cause of and means of eliminating \ndiscrimination and such recommendations for further legislation as may appear desirable,” without \nanywhere authorizing the President  to direct EEOC investigations).  Even assuming the President \nhas the authority the government claims to direct the EEOC to “review” certain industries, no \nauthority is identified by the government—and the Court is aware of none—empowering the \nPresident to direct the EEOC to target specific businesses or individuals for an investigation.  See \ngenerally id. at 26-27.   \nMoreover, the government identifies no authority allowing the President to direct the \ninitiation of investigations without regard to extant statutory prerequisites requiring, for example,  \nbefore the opening of an investigation, that a charge be filed with the Commission that is “in \nwriting under oath or affirmation,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b); see also Commissioner Charges, U.S. \nEEOC,  https://www.eeoc.gov/commissioner-charges#_edn4  (last  visited  May  1,  2025) \n(“Commissioner  charges  must  be  in  writing,  signed,  and  verified.”  (citing  29  C.F.R.  § \n1601.11(a))).  As the Supreme Court has explained, “the EEOC’s investigative authority is tied to \ncharges filed with the Commission; unlike other federal agencies that possess plenary authority to \ndemand to see records relevant to matters within their jurisdiction, the EEOC is entitled to access \nonly to evidence ‘relevant to the charge under investigation.’”  EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.S. \n54,  64  (1984)  (footnote  omitted)  (quoting  42  U.S.C.  §  2000e-8(a)).    Government  counsel \nacknowledges that no such charge meeting statutory prerequisites has been filed against plaintiff.  \nMots. Hr’g Tr. at 74:5-8 (“I don’t think that’s happened here.”); see also id. at 103:7-12 (plaintiff’s \ncounsel noting that the request received from the EEOC “seemed very similar . . . to the type of \nrequest you would get after a charge, which would trigger all the rights that you get under \ncongressionally delegated authority”).  Yet, the inclusion of Section 4(a) in EO 14230 targeting \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 48 of 102\nonly one law firm (plaintiff) implicitly claims all these powers for the President here—both \npresuming the President’s power is so extensive that he may direct the EEOC’s investigative \nattention and also override statutory prerequisites to initiate an EEOC investigation.  These legally \nquestionable assumptions about the scope of presidential power underpin the government’s effort \nto dismiss plaintiff’s claims challenging EO 14230’s Section 4 and only serve to confirm plaintiff’s \nshowing of traceability of harm to this Order and support plaintiff’s standing to challenge Section \n4.   \nIn any event, the Amended Complaint describes actions already taken under the authority \nof EO 14230’s Section 4, see Am. Compl. ¶ 153 (discussing “[t]he threatened investigations into \nPerkin Coie’s hiring, retention, promotion, and training practices”), and alleges specific harm from \nthose actions, id. ¶ 154 (detailing potential costs to plaintiff, in both money and firm resources, as \nwell as reputational harm).  For the same reasons already discussed, see supra Part III.A.3., \nplaintiff’s challenge to threats of investigation as, inter alia, unconstitutional retaliation and \nviewpoint discrimination may properly be considered. \n6.  Plaintiff’s Challenges to EO 14230’s Section 5 are Ripe. \nThe government argues that any challenge to EO 14230’s Section 5 must be dismissed as \npremature, since the exact contours of the restrictions that will be imposed on plaintiff and its \nemployees to limit their “official access from Federal Government buildings” and their “engaging” \nwith “Government employees acting in their official capacity,” EO 14230 § 5(a), are as yet \nunknown, pending the issuance of guidance to implement those two directives, Gov’t’s Mem. at \n28-29 (“Plaintiff can only guess the degree to which agency heads will limit government access.”).  \nAs an initial matter, this ripeness argument does not apply to Section 5(b), which directs agencies \nto “refrain from hiring employees of Perkins Coie, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 49 of 102\nmade in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will \nnot threaten the national security of the United States.”  EO 14230 § 5(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782.  \nAs the fact sheet further explains, this section means “Federal Agencies will . . . refrain from hiring \nPerkins Coie LLP employees unless specifically authorized,” EO 14230 Fact Sheet—no additional \nguidance needed.  So, not even the government contends that any ripeness issue precludes review \nof Section 5(b). \nAs to Section 5(a), the government’s ripeness arguments are unavailing.  The Order makes \nclear that, whatever the exact guidance ultimately issued, the access of employees of Perkins Coie \nto federal buildings and government employees will be “limit[ed]” as a result.  EO 14230 § 5(a), \n90 Fed. Reg. at 11782; see also EO 14230 Fact Sheet (“The Federal Government will . . . restrict \n[plaintiff’s] employees’ access to government buildings.”).  As alleged in the Amended Complaint, \non at least two occasions in the days between issuance of EO 14230 and the TRO, federal \nemployees cancelled meetings with plaintiff’s employees, citing the Order.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 67-\n68.  Partially due to both the directive that access be limited and these cancellations, plaintiff lost \nmultiple clients and representations.  Id. ¶¶ 70-78.  The government’s protestations that plaintiff’s \nchallenges to Section 5 are too speculative are contradicted by these clear, tangible allegations of \nharm.  Consequently, the government’s ripeness argument to obtain dismissal of plaintiff’s claims \nchallenging Section 5 fail on this basis alone. \nIn addition, plaintiff persuasively argues that the mere threat of limited access, whatever \nthe exact details of the final guidance may be, constitutes unconstitutional retaliation to suppress \nviewpoints with which the current presidential administration disagrees.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 20 \n(“Only indiscriminate retaliatory animus can explain” Section 5.).  As previously explained, see \nsupra Part III.A.3., threats of retaliation may be sufficient to constitute unconstitutional retaliation \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 50 of 102\nunder the First Amendment, see infra Part III.B.1., regardless of the ultimate outcome of the \nthreatened actions.  Thus, the Court need not wait for the issuance of final guidance to review \nplaintiff’s claims.  The substance of guidance adopted by each federal agency under the authority \nof Section 5 has no bearing on whether issuance of the threat of limited access to government \nbuildings and officials was unlawful. \n*** \nFor the reasons outline above, each of the government’s general arguments for dismissal, \nwhether construed to fall under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8, 12(b)(1), or 12(b)(6), fail to \nwithstand scrutiny.  Moreover, as discussed next, each of Counts II through IX in plaintiff’s \nAmended Complaint states a claim for relief, not only fully satisfying procedural rules requiring \nthe denial of the government’s motion to dismiss but also entitling plaintiff to summary judgment \nin its favor. \nB.  Plaintiff is Entitled to Summary Judgment \nThe government denies that EO 14230 is designed to be “‘punitive’ or a ‘sanction’” and \ndefends the Order as falling “within the bounds of established executive authority,” Gov’t’s Opp’n \nat 3, claiming that, here, “the Executive Branch [is] acting as contractor and employer, managing \nwho it does business with and how, based on what it believes to be in the public interest,” id. at 5-\n6.  See also TRO Hr’g Tr. at 44:3-6 (government counsel stating, “I don’t think I would use the \nword ‘punitive.’  I would say have an impact and have caused an injury, certainly, to Perkins \nCoie”); Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 29:10-11 (government counsel stating, about Section 2, “we view this as \nnot designed to punish.  We view this as designed to fulfill the concerns that were laid out in \nSection 1”).  By defending the Order as merely an exercise of procurement power, as either a \ncontractor or employer, however, the government strains in two different directions, arguing, on \none hand, that plaintiff lacks standing by not alleging “that the government is currently contracting \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 51 of 102\nfor Plaintiff’s services, or that Plaintiff ever intends to bid for any government contract,” Gov’t’s \nMem. at 21; see supra Part III.A.4, and nevertheless, on the other hand, that EO 14230 is merely \n“direct[ing] a review of Perkins to ensure that the Federal Government’s dealings with it are \nconsistent with the national security of the United States and other public interests,” Gov’t’s Opp’n \nat 5.  The fact is that the government has no relationship with Perkins Coie as either an employer \nor contractor and the Firm’s “dealings” with the government are because of clients represented \neffectively by Perkins Coie on matters that President Trump, his prior campaign or his current \nAdministration, have taken a contrary position, stretching back nearly a decade. \nRegardless of the government’s strained legal position to avoid this obvious fact, the \ngovernment tries to dampen what it calls “all the furor generated in the press and elsewhere,” \nGov’t’s Opp’n at 5, and the “level of hysteria,” id. at 10, by denying that the Order “is the Executive \nBranch . . . acting in its capacity as a sovereign to punish citizens for exercising their First \nAmendment Rights,” id. at 5.  To believe this explanation requires ignoring the past and current \nfactual context for, and the actual text and impact of, EO 14230, which targets plaintiff for adverse \nagency action when plaintiff is neither employed by nor a contractor with the government, see, \ne.g., Gov’t’s Mem. at 21 (arguing that no evidence in the record shows plaintiff is either employed \nby or contracts with the government), and, instead, is a law firm representing some clients disliked \nby the President, engaging in some litigation seeking results disliked by the President, and \noperating its business, in part, in a manner disliked by the President.    \nIn any event, the government is no mere “contractor and employer” and may not act without \nregard to decades of binding precedent holding that the government’s exercise of power must \nconform to the limits imposed by the Constitution.  See, e.g., Dames & Moore, 453 U.S. at 661 \n(recognizing that, even when the President acts “in the field of international relations,” where he \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 52 of 102\nhas “plenary and exclusive power,” the President’s authority “must be exercised in subordination \nto the applicable provisions of the Constitution” (citation omitted)).  Constitutional limits apply, \neven when, as here, the government defends its action as appropriate because of the government’s \nrole as a contractor and employer.  See, e.g., O’Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 \nU.S. 712, 714-15 (1996) (holding that the government, while acting as a contractor, may not \n“retaliate[] against a contractor . . . for the exercise of rights of political association or the \nexpression of political allegiance”); Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 686 (1996) \n(subject to certain limitations, recognizing “the right of independent government contractors not \nto be terminated for exercising their First Amendment rights”); Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., \n497 U.S. 62, 78 (1990) (holding that the government, while acting as an employer, may not \n“condition[] hiring decisions on political belief and association,” except in narrow compelling \ncircumstances); Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972) (holding, in a case involving the \ngovernment acting as an employer, the government may not “deny a benefit to a person on a basis \nthat  infringes  his  constitutionally  protected  interests—especially,  his  interest  in  freedom  of \nspeech”).   \nHere, the Trump Administration’s blunt exercise of power in EO 14230 to target Perkins \nCoie for adverse actions by every Federal agency violates the Constitution in multiple ways, as \ndetailed below by examining each of plaintiff’s claims.   \n1.  EO 14230 Retaliates Against Plaintiff for First Amendment Protected \nActivities, Including Political Viewpoint and Statements Favoring Diversity \nand Inclusion. \n“The First Amendment prohibits government from ‘abridging the freedom of speech, or of \nthe press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a \nredress of grievances.’”  Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 605-06 (2021) \n(quoting U.S. CONST. amend. I).  As the Supreme Court has explained, the First Amendment \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 53 of 102\nprotects the right of “all persons . . . to think and speak as they wish, not as the government \ndemands.”  303 Creative, 600 U.S. at 603.   \n“One obvious implication” of these First Amendment protections is that government \nofficials may not “subject[] individuals to ‘retaliatory actions’ after the fact for having engaged in \nprotected speech.”  Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys., 595 U.S. at 474 (quoting Nieves, 587 U.S. at 398); see \nalso, e.g., Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 592 (1998) (“[T]he First Amendment bars \nretaliation for protected speech.”).  Such “‘[o]fficial reprisal for protected speech . . . ‘threatens to \ninhibit exercise of the protected right.’”  Hartman, 547 U.S. at 256 (quoting Crawford-El, 523 \nU.S. at 588 n.10).  This prohibition also extends to retaliation against individuals for the specific \nviewpoint expressed by their First Amendment protected activities, since the government may not \n“use the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression,” Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188 \n(quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 830), nor use threats of “‘legal sanctions and other means of \ncoercion . . . to achieve the suppression’ of disfavored speech,” id. at 189 (quoting Bantam Books, \n372 U.S. at 67).  Retaliation and threats of retaliation to effectuate viewpoint discrimination “is \nuniquely harmful to a free and democratic society.”  Id. at 187.  As the D.C. Circuit has observed, \n“[r]estrictions based on viewpoint are especially invidious,” since “[i]t is antithetical to a free \nsociety for the government to give ‘one side of a debatable public question an advantage in \nexpressing its views to the people.’”  Frederick Douglass Found., Inc. v. District of Columbia, 82 \nF.4th 1122, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting First Nat’l Bank of Bos. v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785 \n(1978)); see also Ateba v. Leavitt, 133 F.4th 114, 124 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (“Viewpoint discrimination \nis an ‘egregious form of content discrimination,’ which occurs when a government regulation \n‘targets  not  subject  matter,  but  particular  views  taken  by  speakers  on  a  subject.”  (quoting \nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829)).  Ultimately, punishing or denying a benefit to an individual on \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 54 of 102\nthe basis of “constitutionally protected speech or associations” violates the Constitution.  Perry, \n408 U.S. at 597; see also, e.g., Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys., 595 U.S. at 474; Nieves, 587 U.S. at 398; \nCrawford-El, 523 U.S. at 592. \nIn this case, plaintiff claims that EO 14230 targets the Firm for unconstitutional retaliation \nbased  on  two  different  types  of  viewpoints  expressed  by  plaintiff  in  the  exercise  of  First \nAmendment protected activities.  First, in Count V, plaintiff alleges that EO 14230 “single[s] out \nand punish[es] Perkins Coie for its association with, and advocacy on behalf of, the President’s \npolitical  opponents  in  the  2016  and  2020  elections,”  Am.  Compl.  ¶  128,  attributing  those \nviewpoints to plaintiff and “retaliat[ing] against the firm on that basis,” id. ¶ 129.  Second, in Count \nVII, plaintiff claims that EO 14230 unconstitutionally retaliates against plaintiff for “[s]tatements \nin [f]avor of [d]iversity and [i]nclusion.”  Id. at 37 (header of Count VII); see also id. ¶¶ 144-56.   \nTo prevail on these claims, plaintiff must show that (1) the Firm “engaged in conduct \nprotected under the First Amendment”; (2) EO 14230 “took some retaliatory action sufficient to \ndeter a person of ordinary firmness in plaintiff’s position from speaking again”; and (3) there is “a \ncausal link” between the protected First Amendment activity and “the adverse action taken \nagainst” the Firm.  Aref v. Lynch, 833 F.3d 242, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  Here, no \ngenuine dispute of material fact exists as to any of these three elements, and thus plaintiff is entitled \nto summary judgment on Counts V and VII. \n(a)  First Element: Plaintiff Engaged in First Amendment Protected \nActivity. \n \nEO 14230 openly acknowledges that plaintiff engaged in speech and other activities \nprotected by the First Amendment.  Section 1 of the Order, which sets out its “Purpose,” cites three \nreasons for the enumerated action items in Sections 2 through 5 that federal agencies are ordered \nto take against plaintiff: (1) the Firm’s representation of “Hillary Clinton” during the 2016 \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 55 of 102\npresidential election; (2) the Firm’s involvement in litigation against “election laws, including \nthose requiring voter identification”; and (3) the Firm’s alleged discrimination in “hiring and \npromotion” and efforts to “purposefully hide the nature of” this alleged discrimination “through \ndeceiving language.”  EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781.  The associated fact sheet adds a \nfourth: “Perkins Coie LLP has filed lawsuits against the Trump Administration,” which are also \ndescribed as “partisan lawsuits against the United States.”  EO 14230 Fact Sheet.  These four \nreasons are the sole rationales provided for the issuance of EO 14230, see generally EO 14230, 90 \nFed. Reg. at 11781-83; EO 14230 Fact Sheet, and each, on their face, implicate First Amendment \nprotected activities. \ni.  Plaintiff’s Representation of Clients \nThe first, second, and fourth reasons reference the Firm’s representation of clients, namely: \nPresident Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, parties in election litigation, and \nparties challenging Trump Administration actions.  Well-settled law establishes that “advocacy by \n. . . attorney[s] to the courts” falls within the category of “private . . . speech” protected by the First \nAmendment, Legal Servs. Corp., 531 U.S. at 542-43; see also NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, \n429 (1963) (“[T]he First Amendment . . . protects vigorous advocacy, certainly of lawful ends, \nagainst  governmental  intrusion,”  including  litigation,  which  “is  thus  a  form  of  political \nexpression.”),  meaning  that  plaintiff’s  representation  of  a  political  opponent  of  the  current \nPresident and involvement in election litigation and lawsuits against the Trump Administration \nexplicitly qualifies as core First Amendment speech.27   \n \n27   Plaintiff’s involvement in litigation is also protected under the First Amendment right to petition the \ngovernment and thus retaliation on this basis also runs afoul of First Amendment protections, as discussed infra Part \nIII.B.5. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 56 of 102\nMoreover, as part of plaintiff’s involvement in election litigation, EO 14230 further states \nthat plaintiff “worked with” what is described as “activist donors,” specifically naming “George \nSoros,” in bringing these cases.  EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781.  This relationship explicitly \ninvokes core First Amendment associational rights.  See, e.g., Button, 371 U.S. at 430 (affirming \n“the right ‘to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas’” (quoting Patterson, \n357 at 460)).  So, too, does plaintiff’s representation of and association with President Trump’s \nformer presidential opponent.  See generally, e.g., Rutan, 497 U.S. at 64-65, 68-71 (explaining a \nlong line of Supreme Court cases protecting political association); id. at 69 (“Political belief and \nassociation constitute the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment.” (alteration \naccepted) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 356 (1976) (plurality opinion))). \nBoth EO 14230 and the accompanying fact sheet additionally make clear that President \nTrump and his administration disfavor the specific messages conveyed by plaintiff through \ninvolvement in these activities.  For instance, the Order expresses disapproval of the election-\nrelated lawsuits litigated by plaintiff challenging actions supported by President Trump or his \ncampaign, EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781 (describing the challenged laws as “necessary”), \nand  with  other  lawsuits  filed  by  plaintiff  on  behalf  of  its  clients  “against  the  Trump \nAdministration” and “against the United States,” EO 14230 Fact Sheet (emphasis supplied).  The \nOrder also takes issue with plaintiff’s representation in the 2016 presidential election of President \nTrump’s  political  opponent  and,  as  part  of  that  representation,  some  of  plaintiff’s  former \nemployees associated with an opposition research firm, Fusion GPS.  See EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. \nReg. at 11781; see also Pl.’s SMF ¶ 125 (quoting President Trump, immediately before signing \nEO 14230, criticizing plaintiff’s work “against a political opponent” (him) and stating that “it \nshould never be allowed to happen again”).  Finally, the fact sheet disparages plaintiff as “partisan” \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 57 of 102\nthree separate times, EO 14230 Fact Sheet (referring to “partisan lawsuits,” unsubstantiated \nconcerns about “partisan misuse” of information, and associating with “partisan actors who exploit \ntheir influence”), making explicit that those in power disagree with the political and litigation \npositions taken by clients of plaintiff.   \nii.  Plaintiff’s Statements about Diversity \nAs to the third reason—that plaintiff supposedly engages in unlawful discrimination—the \nrecord also demonstrates that this claim refers to plaintiff’s First Amendment protected speech in \nfavor of diversity. \nThe government predicates the claim of discrimination on two items.  First, the government \ncites a 2023 lawsuit challenging plaintiff’s summer fellowship program for first-year law students.  \nGov’t’s Mem. at 8 (citing Am. All. for Equal Rights v. Perkins Coie LLP, No. 3:23-cv-1877 (N.D. \nTex.)).  Plaintiff has explained that, after explicitly affirming the inclusive nature of the fellowship \nand confirming with the plaintiff in that lawsuit that the law student fellowships were open to all, \nthe lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed, in October 2023.  Pl.’s SMF ¶¶ 22-23.  Indeed, the \ngovernment concedes that plaintiff’s description of its fellowship program does “not contain \ndiscriminatory requirements.”  Gov’t’s Mem. at 8 (citing Lawson Decl., Ex. 12, Stip. of Dismissal \n¶¶ 3-4, Am. All. for Equal Rights, ECF No. 31 (filed Oct. 11, 2023), ECF No. 142-2 at 230); see \nalso Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF at 2 (noting, in response to ¶¶ 22-23, that the government does \nnot dispute that plaintiff’s current fellowship program is open to all first-year law students).  \nRegardless of the merits of any claims asserted in the 2023 lawsuit or any alleged or even actual \nillegality in the former version of the fellowship program, this referenced lawsuit provides no \nsupport for the claim that plaintiff currently discriminates against any staff or applicants. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 58 of 102\nThe  government’s  second  proffered  reason  for  the  claim  that  plaintiff  “racially \ndiscriminates,” EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, is plaintiff’s 2019 announcement that the \nfirm had adopted the Mansfield Rule, Gov’t’s Mem. at 10.  This evidence is similarly unavailing \nto show the government had a non-speech basis for acting against plaintiff, for at least two reasons.  \nFirst, the government specifically cites only plaintiff’s “public[] announce[ment]” about adopting \nthe Mansfield Rule—not any evidence that plaintiff implemented the rule in any illegal, let alone \neven suspect, manner.  Id.; see also Gov’t’s Opp’n at 17-19.  To the extent the government relies \nonly on plaintiff’s press release, the government thus explicitly acknowledges reacting only to \nplaintiff’s speech.  See also EEOC Letter at 1 (stating the letter was prompted only by “public \nstatements and court filings” made by plaintiff).   \nMore generally, the Mansfield Rule expressly does not establish any hiring quotas or other \nillegally discriminatory practices, requiring only that participating law firms consider attorneys \nfrom diverse backgrounds for certain positions.  See Pl.’s 2019 Mansfield Press Release.  At the \nmotions hearing, government counsel acknowledged that “[t]he way Mansfield works as far as \ndoing the interviews maybe isn’t so problematic.”  Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 68:17-18.  While a scenario \nmight exist where a law firm impermissibly strays from those commitments, the government has \nprovided no evidence of any such deviation here, or any other evidence that plaintiff has engaged \nin any activity violative of any anti-discrimination law.28 \n \n28   Though conceding the use of the Mansfield Rule for interviews “isn’t so problematic,” Mots. Hr’g Tr. at \n68:17-18, government counsel suggested the problem lies in the way the program “measur[es] their success,” by \n“showing percentage increases” of qualified underrepresented talent in certain positions, which the government \nassumes means the imposition of “targets” and “evaluating people on race, sex, and ethnic-based issues unrelated to \nthem as individuals,” id. at 68:19-23.  This assumption about the metrics reported, however, presupposes that the \nqualified underrepresented talent considered are given a positive preference when other explanations are just as \nplausible for percentage increases of such talent.  The principle underlying such programs is that negative biases \nagainst qualified underrepresented lawyers, due to their race, sex, gender identity, disability or ethnicity, reduce their \nlikelihood of being selected as frequently to interview for positions for which they are qualified, but when firms \nconsider more underrepresented talent on their own individual merit and not disadvantaged for the traits “unrelated \nto them as individuals,” id. at 68:23, firms tend to hire more of these individuals on their own merit.  In other words, \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 59 of 102\nInstead, the government’s briefing reveals the true motivation lurking behind the façade of \ndiscrimination allegations: the administration’s disapproval of plaintiff’s speech in favor of \ndiversity.  This revelation makes clear the pretextual nature of EO 14230’s cited reason regarding \nplaintiff’s purported discrimination.  For instance, the government points to the Firm’s statements \nabout efforts to “contribut[e] to the advancement of our historically underrepresented attorneys” \nand success in hiring “new partners who are women or attorneys of color.”  Gov’t’s Mem. at 10 \n(quoting Lawson Decl., Ex. 2, Perkins Coie LLP: 2023 Vault Law Firm Diversity Survey at 7, ECF \nNo. 143-2 at 10).  Once again, however, the government provides no evidence to suggest that any \nof these statements show any suspect or illegal actions by plaintiff.   \nEven more probative of the fact that plaintiff’s speech is at issue is that the government \nargues that statements in the Amended Complaint “repeatedly assert[ing] [plaintiff’s] commitment \nto  diversity”  and  showing  “no  apparent  intention  of  backing  away”  somehow  support  the \ngovernment actions targeting the Firm in the Order.  Id. at 10-11 (citing Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45, 46, \n146).  This claim could only be true, however, if the actions taken in the Order were premised on \nplaintiff’s statements about diversity, since public statements supporting diversity, standing alone, \nas they do here, provide not even a scintilla of evidence of impropriety, let alone illegality.  A fair \nreading of the record, and taking the government at its word, requires finding that the justification \nfor EO 14230 stemming from plaintiff’s purported “racial discrimination” was motivated only by \nplaintiff’s First Amendment protected speech in support of diversity. \n \nthe metrics might mean exactly the opposite of what the government assumes to be true, and exactly what the \ngovernment says it wants.  \n  In any event, both parties agree that this Court need not rule on the constitutionality of the Mansfield Rule \nto decide this case.  Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 69:22-72:3 (government counsel acknowledging this point); id. at 103:25-\n104:15 (plaintiff’s counsel acknowledging the same).  The government’s mere assertions—just like the \ngovernment’s possibly erroneous assumptions about the Mansfield Rule—provide no evidence of any illegal or \ndiscriminatory practice by plaintiff. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 60 of 102\n(b)  Second Element: EO 14230 Takes Retaliatory Actions Sufficient \nto Chill Speech. \n \nThe second requirement for a retaliation claim, that plaintiff show the actions taken against \nthe Firm were “sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness in plaintiff’s position from \nspeaking again,” Aref, 833 F.3d at 258, is satisfied by plaintiff’s showing of irreparable harm, and \nfurther bolstered by the reactions of plaintiff’s peer law firms.  See infra Part III.C.1 (describing \nthe significant loss of clients and revenue suffered by the Firm in the short time between the \nissuance of EO 14230 and the TRO in this case, as well as the potential for additional severe losses \nwere the temporary injunction order lifted); see also TRO Hr’g Tr. at 44:3-6 (government counsel \nconceding that sections of EO 14230 “have an impact and have caused an injury, certainly, to \nPerkins Coie”).   \nProviding further support for this element are the reactions of other law firms to EO 14230 \nand similar Executive Orders.  Eight days after issuing EO 14230 against plaintiff, on March 14, \n2025, President Trump issued a similar Executive Order against the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, \nWharton & Garrison LLP.  Manning Decl., Ex. 49, Exec. Order 14237 (“Paul, Weiss EO”), 90 \nFed. Reg. 13039 (Mar. 20, 2025), ECF No. 39-4 at 588.  The Paul, Weiss EO contained six \nsections, directing that the same actions be taken against Paul, Weiss as EO 14230 directs against \nplaintiff, compare Paul, Weiss EO, 90 Fed. Reg 13039-40, with EO 14230, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781-\n82, with one exception that Section 4 of the Paul, Weiss EO stated only that “[n]othing in this \norder shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of [EO] 14230 of March 6, 2025 \n(Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP),” Paul, Weiss EO § 4, 90 Fed. Reg. at 13040.  Yet, the \nPaul, Weiss EO was revoked only seven days after its issuance when President Trump reached a \n“deal” with Paul, Weiss, under which agreement that law firm agreed to:  \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 61 of 102\n[A]dopt[] a policy of political neutrality with respect to client selection and \nattorney hiring; tak[e] on a wide range of pro bono matters representing the \nfull political spectrum; commit[] to merit-based hiring, promotion, and \nretention . . .; dedicat[e] the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal \nservices during [President Trump’s] term in office . . .; and other similar \ninitiatives. \n \nManning Decl., Ex. 50, Exec. Order 14244 (“Paul, Weiss Revocation Order”) § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. \n13685, 13685 (Mar. 26, 2025), ECF No. 39-4 at 593.  The fact that Paul, Weiss quickly negotiated \na deal, including an agreement to provide “the equivalent of $40 million” in free legal work, rather \nthan face the potential injuries of the similar Executive Order targeting that firm, see Paul, Weiss \nRevocation Order, 90 Fed. Reg. at 13685, demonstrates the coercive power of such targeting by \nthe Trump Administration.   \nThis conclusion is further confirmed by the reaction of additional peer law firms that chose \nto negotiate deals with the Trump White House to avoid being targeted by similar Executive \nOrders.  See Manning Decl., Ex. 64, ECF 39-4 at 733 (President Trump announcing a deal with \nthe law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP on March 28, 2025, after that law firm \n“engaged proactively with the President and his team” to negotiate a deal though no Executive \nOrder had been issued against that law firm); id., Ex. 59, ECF No. 39-4 at 721-22 (President Trump \nannouncing a similar deal with the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP on April 1, 2025, before \nan Executive Order had been issued against that firm).  \nPresident Trump referred to these deals being cut with law firms, in a speech on April 8, \n2025, stating: “Have you noticed that lots of law firms have been signing up with Trump?  $100 \nmillion, another $100 million, for damages that they’ve done.  But they give you $100 million and \nthen they announce, ‘We have done nothing wrong.’  And I agree, they’ve done nothing wrong.  \nBut what the hell, they’ve given me a lot of money considering they’ve done nothing wrong.  And \nwe’ll use some of those people, some of those great firms, and they are great firms too—they just \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 62 of 102\nhad a bad moment.”  Pl.’s Reply, Ex. 1, Reply Decl. of Christopher N.

Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. 1, Decl. of Ryan Scarborough, Partner, Williams \n& Connolly (“Scarborough Decl.”), Ex. 2, Exec. Order 14263 (“Susman EO”), 90 Fed. Reg. 15615 \n(Apr. 15, 2025), ECF No. 142-1 at 5.  President Trump used the occasion to recount that the \nadministration had “signed with many law firms, the ones that we thought were inappropriate,” \nand stated that “they went for some pretty big numbers.”  Scarborough Decl., Ex. 1 (“Susman EO \nRemarks”) at 16:02-16:25, ECF No. 142-1 at 3.  President Trump then asked Deputy White House \nChief of Staff Steven Miller, “what’s the total right now Steve?” and Miller responded, “getting to \nclose to, probably, six, 700 million now I would think.  Multiple at 100 million, some at 125 \nmillion.  So, the numbers are adding up.  We’re going to be close to a billion soon.”  Id. at 16:25-\n16:40. As to the Susman EO he had just signed, President Trump then said, “this one, we’re just \nstarting the process with this one.”  Id. at 16:55-17:00.29  Whether President Trump’s focus on \n“the process” refers to enforcement of the Susman EO or that this Order was the opening gambit—\nakin to the Paul, Weiss EO followed by the Paul, Weiss Revocation Order—for deal negotiations, \nis unclear. \n \n29   For context, the Deputy White House Chief of Staff’s reference to getting “close to a billion soon” may \ninclude the five law firm deals announced by the White House just two days later, where each firm promised either \n$100 million or $125 million in free legal work.  See, e.g., Eric Tucker, Trump Reaches Deals with 5 Law Firms, \nAllowing Them to Avoid Prospect of Punishing Executive Orders, Associated Press (Apr. 11, 2025), \nhttps://apnews.com/article/trump-law-firms-executive-order-fe8f38a61cf77c5bb6add1315f5f96f1. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 63 of 102\nWhat is clear is that the Trump White House has publicly touted the negotiated deals \nreached with various law firms, and equally clear is that those deal-making firms have been spared, \nor had revoked, an Executive Order targeting them.  That is the one clear benefit of the deal to the \nlaw firms, since other than the monetary value of the promised free legal work, the precise terms \nof each deal are somewhat fuzzy.  The government, when asked, was unable to fill in basic details, \nfor example, about whether the deal terms were written down or otherwise memorialized, the \nduration of the deals, or how recipients of the promised free legal work would be identified.  Mots. \nHr’g Tr. at 8:23-9:13 (government counsel saying “I can’t say anything more than . . . what I have \nread in the papers” about the law firm deals); id. at 9:19-10:3 (government counsel stating “I don’t \nhave the answers” about duration of these deals); id. at 10:24-11:7, 11:18-22 (government counsel \nsaying “I don’t have any insight on what, if any, mechanics are in play” to determine recipients of \nfree legal work under the deals and repeating “I just don’t have that insight”).   \nNevertheless, each additional deal provides further evidence to satisfy the second element \nof plaintiff’s retaliation claim, given that each of these firms, presumably possessing “ordinary \nfirmness,” sought successfully to avoid being targeted by similar Executive branch actions, with \neach law firm committing the equivalent of $100 million or more as part of the price to do so.  See \nalso Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 86:14-18 (plaintiff’s counsel noting that these firms have “some of the most \ntalented lawyers in the world with the most resources, and they chose silence”); Br. of Amici \nCuriae 504 Law Firms in Supp. of Pl.’s MSJ ¶¶ 1-2, ECF No. 78 (noting that EO 14230 and others \nlike it “seek to cow every other firm . . . into submission” and explaining the “looming threat” that \n“any . . . representation challenging actions of the current administration (or even causes it \ndisfavors) now brings with it the risk of devastating retaliation”); Br. of Amici Curiae Litigation \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 64 of 102\nFirms in Supp. of Pl.’s MSJ at 1, ECF No. 94 (“Lawyers cannot fearlessly represent causes or \nclients . . . if they fear government reprisal.”). \n(c)  Third Element: The Retaliation is Causally Linked to Plaintiff’s \nFirst Amendment Protected Activity. \n \nFinally, the record is clear that EO 14230 is motivated by retaliation for plaintiff’s First \nAmendment protected activity.  Resisting this conclusion, the government protests that EO 14230 \ndoes not retaliate against plaintiff for First Amendment activity but instead takes action “based on \nwhat it believes to be in the public interest.”  Gov’t’s Opp’n at 6.  Here, however, these arguments \nare merely two sides of the same coin.  The four reasons provided by the Order to justify targeting \nplaintiff all refer to President Trump’s objections to plaintiff’s protected speech and associations.  \nNeither the Order nor the accompanying fact sheet provide any basis to find that plaintiff threatens \nthe public interest or national interest other than the stated disagreements with plaintiff’s First \nAmendment protected activity.  See generally EO 14230, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781 (providing only \nthe reasons already discussed to justify the Order); EO 14230 Fact Sheet (same).  That plaintiff’s \nprotected activities are the only reasons provided by the Order itself to justify the actions directed \nis strong evidence that the Order retaliates against plaintiff for engaging in those protected \nactivities.  Analysis of each section of the Order, as well as the context surrounding its issuance, \nonly adds reasons to confirm this conclusion and further shows that the legal infirmity of retaliation \npermeates every section and sentence of EO 14230.  \ni.  EO 14230’s Section 2 \nThe record demonstrates that retaliation is the only plausible motive for the “Security \nClearance Review” ordered in Section 2 in two additional ways.  First, to the extent the government \nargues the security clearance directives were motivated by alleged national security concerns \nstemming from contacts with Fusion GPS in 2016, see Gov’t’s Opp’n at 9, plaintiff has no current \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 65 of 102\nemployee who was involved in that engagement, and none of the attorneys involved have been \nemployed by plaintiff for at least three years, Pl.’s SMF ¶ 75; Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF at 3 (not \ndisputing ¶ 75).  The government cannot credibly claim that targeting plaintiff’s current employees \nwould remedy any national security concerns related to Fusion GPS when none of those employees \nwere involved with Fusion GPS.  \nThis is particularly true in light of the undisputed record in this case, which establishes, in \nplaintiff’s expert report from J. William Leonard, who worked in personnel security at the \nDepartment of Defense from 1973 to 2002, including serving as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nDefense responsible for security and information operations, and Principal Director in that same \noffice, that “a hallmark of the [security clearance review] process . . . is that it is an individualized \none.”  Pl.’s MSJ, Ex. 8, Expert Report of J. William Leonard, former Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof Defense and Dep’t of Defense personnel security officer (“Leonard Rep.”) ¶¶ 2-3, 30, ECF No. \n39-8 (emphasis supplied).  Mr. Leonard attests that “the granting, suspending, and revoking of \nsecurity clearances is a highly individualized process that involves a close and detailed factual \nanalysis of the individual in question,” id. ¶ 35 (emphasis supplied), where “Person A is never held \naccountable for the conduct of Person B, let alone are Persons 1 through 2,500 held accountable \nfor the conduct of formerly-associated Person 2,501,” id. ¶ 44.  Yet, accepting the government’s \nproffered reason—plaintiff’s previous dealings with Fusion GPS—as true, holding all of plaintiff’s \ncurrent employees responsible for actions taken by individuals who have not been associated with \nthe Firm for at least three years does exactly that.  See Pl.’s SMF ¶¶ 71, 75 (Elias left the Firm in \n2021); id. ¶ 76 (same with Sussmann); see also id. ¶ 95 (stating that no Perkins Coie employee \nwho held a security clearance at the time EO 14230 was issued “had any involvement in the Fusion \nGPS matter” (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 41)). \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 66 of 102\nThe conclusion that Section 2 engages in this type of punishment-by-association is further \nstrengthened by President Trump’s admission, in a post on Truth Social on April 23, 2025, the day \nthe parties appeared for a motions hearing in this case, that EO 14230’s actions against plaintiff \nwere motivated by “the conduct of a specific member of this firm.”  @RealDonaldTrump, Truth \nSocial  (Apr.  23,  2025,  9:35  AM), \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114387538306195784  [hereinafter  Trump \nApril 23, 2025, Post].  Since this statement confirms that the Order targeted the entire Firm because \nthe President disliked the purported actions of one person, and thus strongly suggests that no firm-\nwide national security concern exists, it points strongly to retaliation as the motivation for EO \n14230, rather than any legitimate concerns about the Firm or its employees writ large.    \nSecond, and tellingly, the Paul, Weiss EO contained a virtually identical security clearance \nreview provision to the one at issue in this case.  Compare EO 14230 § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, \nwith Paul, Weiss EO § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 13039.  As discussed, see supra Part III.B.1(b), the Paul, \nWeiss EO was revoked only seven days after its issuance when President Trump reached a “deal” \nwith that firm.  See generally Paul, Weiss Revocation Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 13685.  While the Paul, \nWeiss Revocation Order summarized that firm’s agreement to, inter alia, “adopt[] a policy of \npolitical neutrality with respect to client selection and attorney hiring; tak[e] on a wide range of \npro  bono  matters  representing  the  full  political  spectrum;  commit[]  to  merit-based  hiring, \npromotion, and retention . . .; dedicat[e] the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services \nduring [President Trump’s] term in office . . .; and other similar initiatives,” none of these agreed-\nupon policy or practice changes appear to explain or address how any national security concerns \nsufficient to warrant the Paul, Weiss EO could have changed so rapidly.  Id. § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n13685.  The speed of the reversal and the rationale provided in the Paul, Weiss Revocation Order, \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 67 of 102\nwhich focused only on agreements to advance policy initiatives of the Trump Administration, see \nid.,  further  support  the  conclusion  that  national  security  considerations  are  not  a  plausible \nexplanation for Section 2. \nii.  EO 14230’s Section 3 \n     As to Section 3 of the Order, the fact sheet says it all: plaintiff and its clients with \ngovernment contracts are targeted because of plaintiff’s “partisan lawsuits.”  EO14230 Fact Sheet.  \nThe retaliation for core First Amendment speech, see Legal Servs. Corp., 531 U.S. at 542-43, and \nthe viewpoint expressed by that advocacy, could not be stated more explicitly. \nThe government tries to defend Section 3 by insisting that plaintiff is acting as a “contractor \n[in] pressing these claims” challenging this part of the Order, and invoking Board of County \nCommissioners v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 671 (1996).  Gov’t’s Mem. at 22-23. This defense of \nSection 3 is doomed for two obvious reasons.  First, plaintiff is not a government contractor, as the \ngovernment concedes.  See Gov’t’s Mem. at 21 (“Plaintiff never alleges that the government is \ncurrently contracting for Plaintiff’s services, or that Plaintiff ever intends to bid for any government \ncontract.”).  \nSecond, given that plaintiff is not a government contractor, and that plaintiff advances the \nFirst Amendment retaliation claims only as to itself and not on behalf of any of plaintiff’s clients, \nsee Am. Compl. ¶¶ 126-35 (claiming, in Count V, retaliation only against Perkins Coie); id. ¶¶ \n144-56 (same in Count VII), the Supreme Court case relied upon by the government is simply \ninapplicable here.  Umbehr involved a claim of unlawful retaliation brought by a contractor who \nalleged his contract to provide solid waste disposal services to a county had been cancelled due to \nhis criticisms of the county and its Board of County Commissioners.  518 U.S. at 671-72.  The \nSupreme Court held that “independent contractors are protected” against retaliation for First \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 68 of 102\nAmendment protected activities, id. at 673, but that the scope of this protection for government \ncontractors is determined by balancing “the [government]’s legitimate interests as contractor, \ndeferentially  viewed,”  against  “the  free  speech  interests  at  stake,”  id.  at  685;  see  also  id. \n(describing the steps required for a contractor to prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim \nunder the balancing test).  The government points to this balancing test and argues this test favors \nthe government and justifies the actions directed in Section 3.  Gov’t’s Mem. at 23.  Yet, because \nplaintiff is not a government contractor and is instead is “a non-government-contractor law firm,” \nPl.’s Opp’n at 16 (emphasis in original), the balancing step is never reached here.30  Instead of a \nbalancing test, the general rule governs, see supra Part III.B.1, namely, that “the First Amendment \nprohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions . . . for speaking \nout.”  Hartman, 547 U.S. at 256 (citing Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 592). \niii.  EO 14230’s Section 4 \n Section 4, by implication, directs the EEOC to investigate plaintiff, as the government has \nconceded.  See Gov’t’s Mem. at 2 (recognizing that Section 4 directs “review [of] whether Perkins \nCoie and like employers are violating the civil rights laws”).  Under Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, however, the EEOC’s “investigative authority is tied to charges filed with the \nCommission,” Shell Oil, 466 U.S. at 64, meaning that, with few exceptions not relevant here, “the \nEEOC is entitled to access only to evidence ‘relevant to the charge under investigation,’” id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-8(a)).  See also McLane Co., Inc. v. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 75 (2017) \n(“The  EEOC’s  responsibilities  ‘are  triggered  by  the  filing  of  a  specific  sworn  charge  of \n \n30   It is also worth noting that the government could not succeed even under the Umbehr balancing test, \nbecause it has failed to show any legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for taking the actions directed in EO 14230’s \nSection 3 (or the Order more broadly).  In asserting that plaintiff engages in “racial discrimination” and that this \nallegation justifies the actions in Section 3, Gov’t’s Mem. at 23, the government offers no evidence to support this \nclaim, while plaintiff has a legitimate interest in using its First Amendment rights to discuss the importance of \ndiversity in the legal field.

Instead, on March 17, 2025, eleven days after EO 14230 was issued and six days after \nthis lawsuit was filed, making clear that plaintiff did not intend to make a “deal” with President \nTrump, the Acting Chair of the EEOC sent an 11-page letter to plaintiff requesting information on \nplaintiff’s hiring and employment practices, see generally EEOC Letter, and posted publicly a \n \n31   The EEOC may conduct a “directed investigation”—an investigation without a charge—for “possible age-\nbased discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and sex-based pay discrimination \nunder the Equal Pay Act (EPA).”  Directed Investigations, U.S. EEOC, https://www.eeoc.gov/directed-\ninvestigations#_ednref3 (last visited Apr. 29, 2025) (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 211(a), 626).  Neither is relevant to this \ncase. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 70 of 102\npress release that same day about the letter and others sent to 19 additional law firms, Manning \nDecl., Ex 35, ECF No. 39-4 at 357. \nA legitimate investigation by the EEOC would follow the congressionally mandated \nprocess,  with  appropriate  initiation  procedures  and  compliance  with  statutorily  mandated \nprotections afforded to plaintiff.  See Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 99:19-100:4 (plaintiff’s counsel noting that, \nunder  a  formal  EEOC  investigation,  plaintiff  would  have  a  number  of  rights,  including \n“confidentiality” and “due process,” the latter of which would include “[n]otice, the right to be \nheard, evidentiary submissions, the right to have lawyers in the process, [and] the right to know \nwhat the charge is that you are going up against,” and further noting that “all of those things are \nabsent here”); see also Eberspaecher N. Am., 67 F.4th at 1131-32 (reviewing the EEOC’s \nenforcement procedures, including relevant protections for the charged party).  These hallmarks \nof a legitimate investigation are missing here, and the government makes no excuse for the EEOC \nsimply ignoring these statutory requirements.  By not following its own procedures, the EEOC has \nundermined the legitimacy of its own investigation, revealing this investigation of plaintiff to be a \nproduct of the retaliation ordered by EO 14230 rather than any legitimate investigative activity. \niv.  EO 14230’s Section 5 \nThe retaliatory nature of Section 5 is clear from its stunning overbreadth.  Under this \nsection, all agencies of the federal government are directed to limit the access of all of plaintiff’s \nemployees—from  attorneys  to  secretaries  to  mailroom  attendants,  no  matter  who  they  are \n(including some current reservists in the United States military, Pl.’s SMF ¶ 11)—to federal \nbuildings and officials.  EO 14230 § 5(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782 (directing “[t]he heads of all \nagencies” to “provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to \nemployees of Perkins Coie when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 71 of 102\nbe inconsistent with the interests of the United States,” as well as guidance “limiting Government \nemployees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees”); EO \n14230 Fact Sheet.  \nThe government’s protestations that “[w]e have no idea” what the eventual guidance will \nlook like, Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 83:13-14, strain credulity, given the text of EO 14230, which directs \nagencies to “limit[]” access to buildings and government officials, EO 14230 § 5(a), 90 Fed. Reg. \nat 11782, and the fact sheet, which says the government will “restrict” such access, EO 14230 Fact \nSheet.  These intentions were also laid bare in statements made by the White House Staff Secretary \nat a televised signing ceremony for a similar Executive Order targeting the law firm Susman \nGodfrey LLP.  See Susman EO.  The Susman EO contains a Section 5(a) virtually identical to \nSection 5(a) in EO 14230.  Compare Susman EO § 5, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15616, with EO 14230 § \n5(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782.  In explaining the Susman EO to President Trump, the staff secretary \nstated that the Susman EO would “make sure they can’t access government resources, government \nbuildings.”  Scarborough Decl., Ex. 1 (“Susman EO Remarks”) at 15:45-15:59, ECF No. 142-1 at \n3.   \nThe government also downplays the impact of Section 5(a) by pointing to the text that \nlimitations on plaintiff’s employees’ access to government buildings will apply “when such access \nwould threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United \nStates.”  EO 14230 § 5(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782; see TRO Hr’g at 56:14-21, 24-25; 57:15-18.  \nThese limitations do not save this section because the outcome of any assessment of national \nsecurity risks and United States’ “interests” are pre-determined by the findings in Section 1 and \ninstructions in other parts of the Order.  Indeed, the fact sheet confirms this point: “The Federal \nGovernment will . . . restrict [plaintiff’s] employees’ access to government buildings.”  EO 14230 \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 72 of 102\nFact Sheet.  Sections 1 and 3 also make clear the President’s determination that interactions with \nplaintiff do not comport with his view of the national interest.  See, e.g., EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. \nReg. at 11781 (making purported findings about the “dishonest and dangerous” and “egregious \nactivity” of plaintiff and thus finding “good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our \nNation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds”); id. § 3(b)(i), 90 Fed. \nReg. at 11782 (determining that “any contract . . . for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform \nany service” should be terminated); TRO Hr’g Tr. at 18:15-20 (plaintiff’s counsel explaining that \n“agencies are already told what the outcome of their analysis is, because they have been told in \nSection 1 that working with [plaintiff] is not consistent with the national interest and not consistent \nwith the administration and policies of the administration.”).   \nSection 5(b) requires agencies to “refrain from hiring Perkins Coie LLP employees unless \nspecifically authorized,” EO 14230 Fact Sheet, which requires receipt of “a waiver” from the head \nof two separate federal agencies, EO 14230 § 5(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782.  This provision is vague \nabout  whether  this  subsection  applies  only  to  employees  leaving  Perkins  Coie  directly  for \ngovernment service or more broadly to any former employee of the Firm for any duration. By \nimposing the burden of an explicit order to “refrain” from hiring any Perkins Coie employee for \nan Executive branch position, compounded by the extra burden of obtaining an affirmative waiver \nfrom two agency heads to effectuate such a hire, this subsection operates as a virtual government \nhiring ban on current and possibly any former Perkins Coie employees. The government offers \nabsolutely no justification, let alone any legitimate government interest for this government action \nimposing such a sweeping hiring ban.  See generally Gov’t’s Opp’n.  \nAgain, particularly given that President Trump has confirmed the Order was motivated by \n“the conduct of a specific member of this firm,” Trump April 23, 2025, Post, the targeting of all \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 73 of 102\nthe Firm’s employees for such access and hiring restrictions simply cannot be explained by any \nlegitimate governmental purpose, leaving only retaliation as the obvious reason for the First \nAmendment protected speech and other activities with which EO 14230 takes issue. \nv.   President Trump’s Prior Statements about Perkins Coie \nIn addition to the text of EO 14230, President Trump’s repeated prior statements about \nplaintiff and lawyers formerly associated with the Firm provide probative context that informs \nassessment of the retaliatory purpose of the Order as a whole.  Since 2017, President Trump has \nrepeatedly attacked plaintiff and its former employees for representing clients involved in the 2016 \nand 2020 presidential elections, as well as the 2018 midterm election, see supra n.8 and associated \ntext, accusing the Firm of involvement in “[c]ollusion” during the 2016 campaign, August 6, 2018, \nTrump Tweets; criticizing the Firm’s “dishonesty,” November 9, 2018, Trump Remarks at 5; \naccusing Marc Elias of “stealing” elections and engaging in election fraud, November 9, 2018, \nTrump Tweet; and sharing online articles claiming that plaintiff and Michael Sussmann tried to \n“[c]orrupt a Presidential Election,” December 11, 2022, Trump Post, as just some examples.  \nPresident  Trump’s  nearly  decade-long  preoccupation  with  plaintiff’s  election  litigation  and \nrepresentation of Democratic political candidates, as well as his grievances about the Firm’s work \nin those client matters, are reflected in the purpose of the Order, which justifies the actions taken \nagainst plaintiff, in part, on the Firm’s representation of his political opponent during the 2016 \npresidential election and election law litigation, EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, as well as \nthe fact sheet, which takes issue with plaintiff’s “partisan lawsuits,” EO 14230 Fact Sheet.   \nThat EO 14230 was issued as retribution for plaintiff’s work and President Trump’s \ngrievances is further confirmed by President Trump’s statements during the 2024 presidential \ncampaign, when he continued to attack plaintiff and its former lawyers, Marc Elias and Michael \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 74 of 102\nSussmann, and explicitly promised to take some form of action if he were elected. In September \n2023, for instance, President Trump inveighed against those who “spied on my Campaign, \nImpeached me twice, had the Russia, Russia Hoax, [sic], the Fake Dossier Hoax, FISA Fraud, \nElection Fraud, the ‘No Collusion’ Mueller Hoax, and so much more,” and proclaimed that, “[i]f \nI am elected, they will be brought to JUSTICE.”  September 6, 2023, Trump Post.  In March 2024, \nhe shared an article on Truth Social titled, “Marc Elias is Scared…And He Should Be.”  March \n31, 2024, Trump Post.  In the last two months of the campaign, Trump posted a message three \nseparate times on Truth Social warning about “the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has \ntaken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election,” warning that “WHEN I WIN, \nthose people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law,” including \n“Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, and Corrupt Election Officials.”  Trump \nCease & Desist Post.  These retaliation threats have now come to fruition against plaintiff, through \nthe  issuance  of  EO  14230,  which  outlines  in  the  “Purpose”  section  some  of  these  same \nlongstanding grievances.  See EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781; EO 14230 Fact Sheet.  \nPresident Trump’s multi-year history of lodging public attacks critical of plaintiff, his promises \nduring the 2024 campaign to act on his displeasure toward plaintiff if he won, and the subsequent \nissuance of EO 14230—which repeats many of the same attacks on plaintiff—further demonstrates \nthat EO 14230 was issued to seek retribution against plaintiff for the Firm’s representation of \nclients in political campaigns or litigation, about which President Trump expressed disapproval, \ndating back to 2017.  This purpose amounts to no more than unconstitutional retaliation for \nplaintiff’s First Amendment protected activity. \nvi.   President Trump’s Statements about Other Law Firms \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 75 of 102\nAs part of the evidence submitted in support of the retaliation claim, plaintiff has included \nevidence of actions taken by President Trump against other prominent law firms, positing that \nthey, along with EO 14230, are part of a “campaign of retribution.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 6.  For instance, \non February 25, 2025, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum targeting the law firm \nCovington & Burling LLP, ordering the immediate suspension of all active security clearances \nheld by one named partner of that firm and “all members, partners, and employees of Covington \n& Burling LLP who assisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith during his time as Special \nCounsel, pending a review and determination of their roles and responsibilities, if any, in the \nweaponization of the judicial process.”  Manning Decl., Ex. 45 (“Covington Memorandum”), ECF \nNo. 39-4 at 578.32  President Trump had previously attacked Special Counsel Smith, who was \nappointed to investigate allegations that President Trump interfered with the lawful transfer of \npower following the 2020 presidential election and retained classified information following his \npresidency, as “Deranged” and the “worst” of the “Crooked Election Interference ‘Thugs’ from \nthe DOJ,” in a post on Truth Social on July 30, 2023.  Manning Decl., Ex. 44, ECF No. 39-4 at \n576; id., Ex. 43, Final Report of the Special Counsel Under 28 C.F.R. § 600.8 at 1, ECF No. 39-4 \nat 401 (describing the scope of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation); see also id., Ex. 42, \nTom Dreisbach, Trump Has Made More Than 100 Threats to Prosecute or Punish Perceived \nEnemies at 9, NPR (Oct. 22, 2024, 7:00 AM), ECF No. 39-4 at 382 (describing additional \nstatements made by President Trump about Smith).   \nSimilarly, on March 25, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order targeting the \nlaw firm Jenner & Block LLP (“Jenner”) with provisions substantially similar to EO 14230.  \n \n32   Despite the more limited scope of the suspension and review of security clearances ordered in the \nCovington Memorandum, government counsel was unaware of the status of the investigation or whether any \nclearances had been restored.  Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 43:8-14. \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 76 of 102\nManning Decl., Ex. 52, Executive Order 14246 (“Jenner EO”), 90 Fed. Reg. 13997 (Mar. 28, \n2025), ECF No. 39-4 at 598 (containing a “Background” section making statements and purported \nfindings, Sections 2, 3, and 5 directing the same actions against Jenner as the corresponding \nsections in EO 14230, and Section 4 stating, “[n]othing in this order shall be construed to limit the \naction authorized by section 4 of [EO] 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins \nCoie LLP)”).  Section 1 of the Jenner EO invoked, as part of the justification for the Order, the \nwork of a former Jenner partner on the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, calling it \na “partisan prosecution” and an “entirely unjustified investigation.”  Id. § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 13997; \nsee also Manning Decl., Ex. 58, Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from \nJenner & Block, The White House (Mar. 25, 2025), ECF No. 39-4 at 715 (attacking the Jenner \npartner for, among other allegations, “dishonesty” and making an “overt demand that the federal \ngovernment pursue a political agenda against President Trump”).  At a televised signing ceremony \nfor the Jenner EO, President Trump noted that the same Jenner partner “is the main culprit . . . with \nrespect to this firm,” and criticized this partner as “a bad guy.”  Manning Decl., Ex. 63, ECF No. \n39-4 at 730. \nOn March 27, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order targeting the law firm \nWilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (“WilmerHale”), id., Ex. 54, Executive Order 14250 \n(“WilmerHale EO”), 90 Fed. Reg. 14549 (Apr. 3, 2025), ECF No. 39-4 at 604, which, other than \nthe background section, was virtually identical to the Jenner EO, compare id. with Jenner EO, 90 \nFed. Reg. 13997.  Section 1 of the WilmerHale EO criticized the firm for “reward[ing] Robert \nMueller and” two of his colleagues “by welcoming them to the firm after they wielded the power \nof the Federal government to lead one of the most partisan investigations in American history.”  \n90 Fed. Reg. at 14549; see also Manning Decl., Ex. 57, Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 77 of 102\nAddresses Risks from WilmerHale, The White House (Mar. 27, 2025), ECF No. 39-4 at 710 \n(containing similar statements about Mueller). \nViewed in conjunction with the facts and context of the instant case, the Covington \nMemorandum, Jenner EO, and WilmerHale EO support the plaintiff’s description of a “broader \ncampaign,” Pl.’s Reply at 13, of President Trump using the power of the presidency to target \nindividual lawyers and law firms associated with them based on personal dislike of their legal \nwork—in other words, for retribution. \n*** \nEO 14230, the accompanying fact sheet, and the context surrounding the Order’s issuance \neach  express  President  Trump’s  disapproval  of  plaintiff’s  First  Amendment  activity  and \ndemonstrate that EO 14230 targeted plaintiff because the Firm expressed support for employment \npolicies the President does not like, represented clients the President does not like, represented \nclients seeking litigation results the President does not like, and represented clients challenging \nsome of the President’s actions, which he also does not like.  That is unconstitutional retaliation \nand viewpoint discrimination, plain and simple.  Plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to summary \njudgment on Counts V and VII. \n2.     EO 14230’s Section 3 Violates the First Amendment Associational \nRights of Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Clients by Compelled Disclosure. \n \nPlaintiff contends that EO 14230’s Section 3, which directs all “Government contracting \nagencies” to “require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie,” \neither related or not to the contractor’s government work, EO 14230 § 3(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, \nviolates the First Amendment rights of plaintiff and its clients to engage in private associations.  \nPl.’s Mem. at 20; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 21-23.  The Supreme Court has long recognized that \n“compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute as effective \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 78 of 102\na restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action,” and that a “vital \nrelationship” exists “between freedom to associate and privacy in one’s associations.”  Bonta, 594 \nU.S. at 606-07 (quoting Patterson, 357 U.S. at 462).   \nOf course, plaintiff is a business of attorneys, at least some of whom litigate, see, e.g., Pl.’s \nSMF ¶¶ 24-26, and in the normal course of litigation those attorneys necessarily engage in \nadvocacy, satisfying the first requirement for constitutional protection.  This advocacy is on behalf \nof plaintiff’s clients, who also have a fundamental First Amendment right in speaking and \nassociating with counsel.  See, e.g., Jacobs v. Schiffer, 204 F.3d 259, 264-66 (D.C. Cir. 2000) \n(recognizing that a government employee has “an interest in communicating with his attorney” \nunder the First Amendment and reviewing the contours of that right); Mothershed v. Justs. of the \nSup. Ct., 410 F.3d 602, 611 (9th Cir. 2005) (“We recognize that—at least as a general matter—the \n‘right to hire and consult and attorney is protected by the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom \nof speech, association and petition.” (quoting Denius v. Dunlap, 209 F.3d 944, 953 (7th Cir. \n2000))); Denius, 209 F.3d at 953 (“The right to hire and consult an attorney is protected by the \nFirst Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech, association and petition.”); DeLoach v. \nBevers, 922 F.2d 618, 620 (10th Cir. 1990) (“The right to retain and consult with an attorney . . . \nimplicates . . . clearly established First Amendment rights of association and free speech.”).  This \nFirst Amendment right of counsel with their clients to consult and work together is akin to \nengaging in collective action that Supreme Court precedents firmly uphold.  See United Transp. \nUnion v. State Bar of Mich., 401 U.S. 576, 585-86 (1971) (“[C]ollective activity undertaken to \nobtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right within the protection of the First \nAmendment.”); United Mine Workers of Am. v. Ill.

Trainmen v. Virginia, 377 U.S. 1, 7 (1964) (“A \nState could not . . . infringe in any way the right of individuals and the public to be fairly \nrepresented in lawsuits.”); Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 376 n.32 (1977) (“Underlying \n[the previous three cases] was the Court’s concern that the aggrieved receive information regarding \ntheir legal rights and the means of effectuating them.  This concern applies with at least as much \nforce to aggrieved individuals as it does to groups.”). \nTo  prevail  in  a  challenge  to  the  government’s  compelled  disclosure  of  a  protected \nassociation, the government, not the plaintiff, bears the burden of meeting an exacting standard by \nshowing  “a  substantial  relationship  between  the  disclosure  requirement  and  a  sufficiently \nimportant governmental interest,” Bonta, 594 U.S. at 607 (quoting Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 196 \n(2010)), and, further, that the disclosure requirement is “narrowly tailored to the government’s \nasserted interest,” id. at 608; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 22 (pointing out that “the government must \ndemonstrate” the standard is satisfied).  Confusingly, the government identifies this standard but \nthen ignores the fact that the burden is on the government to explain how the challenged \ngovernment disclosure requirement satisfies the standard.  See Gov’t’s Mem. at 22; Gov’t’s Opp’n \nat 21.  Besides failing to acknowledge its burden, the government also makes zero effort to explain \nhow EO 14230’s Section 3(a)’s disclosure requirement is substantially related to and serves a \nsufficiently important government purpose, and is narrowly tailored to do so, see generally Gov’t’s \nMem., which is a heavy lift the government cannot support. \nAs already found, see supra Part III.B.1, the express purpose of EO 14230 and its action \nitems  for  all  Executive  branch  agencies  to  implement,  including  Section  3(a),  amount  to \nunconstitutional  retaliation  against  plaintiff  for  First  Amendment  protected  activity.    The \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 80 of 102\ngovernment, consequently, has no legitimate interests in the disclosures compelled by government \ncontractors under Section 3(a), much less a sufficiently important one to satisfy exacting scrutiny.   \nEven were some government interest found to exist for such compelled disclosure by a \nparticular government contractor due to the type or nature of the contract, Section 3(a) makes no \nsuch distinction and compels disclosure by all government contractors to any federal agency with \nwhich the contractor holds a contract—no matter whether the contract is for crucial classified \nmilitary equipment costing millions of dollars per item delivered or for paper clips costing pennies, \nand no matter whether the disclosure of association with plaintiff had anything to do with a \ngovernment contract.  Thus, Section 3 is not narrowly tailored to any identifiable government \ninterest in particular types of contracts, based on the nature of the goods or services provided to \nthe government or even the amount of government funds committed.  The government also cannot \nshow that Section 3 is narrowly tailored to any legitimate goal with respect to monitoring contracts, \nsince the Order requires disclosure of “any business” that contractors do with plaintiff—not merely \nbusiness related to government contracts.  EO 14230 § 3(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781 (emphasis \nsupplied).  Therefore, plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on Count VI.   \n3.  EO 14230 Violates Plaintiff’s Right to Equal Protection of the Law. \nThe  Constitution’s  guarantee  of  equal  protection  under  the  law  is  violated  when \ngovernment action treats someone “differently from others similarly situated and . . . there is no \nrational basis for the difference in treatment.”  Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 \n(2000).  This type of so-called “class of one” claim may be brought under the Fourteenth \nAmendment when the alleged violation is committed by a state government actor, see, e.g., id. at \n563, and under the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause, which prohibits denial of equal \nprotection of the laws, when the alleged violation is committed by federal government actors, see, \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 81 of 102\ne.g., Weinberger v. Weisenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638 n.2 (1975) (“This Court’s approach to Fifth \nAmendment equal protection claims has always been precisely the same as to equal protection \nclaims under the Fourteenth Amendment.” (citations omitted)); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. \nPena, 515 U.S. 200, 217 (1995) (“Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the \nsame as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.” (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93 \n(1976))).  Of course, bringing a “class of one” claim does not literally require plaintiff to be the \nonly one in the class, or only law firm, targeted.  See Vill. of Willowbrook, 528 U.S. at 564 n.* \n(“[T]he number of individuals in a class is immaterial for equal protection analysis.”).  Instead, as \nplaintiff correctly observes, “[t]he key is that differential treatment is not based on ‘membership \nin a protected class’ but on arbitrary mistreatment or animus.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 37 n.12 (quoting \nFranks v. Rubitschun, 312 Fed. App’x 764, 765-66 (6th Cir. 2009)). \nPlaintiff alleges that the government must put forward a “plausible reason” for treating the \nFirm differently than other law firms, by “intentionally target[ing] Perkins Coie with extraordinary \nsanctions not levied on other, materially similarly situated firms or lawyers,” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 120-\n21 (Count IV) (citing FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313-14 (1993)), and by \nexpressly justifying EO 14230 based on “ten-year-old allegations that courts have rejected and that \ninvolve partners whom Perkins Coie has not employed for several years,” id. ¶ 123, and “for \nrepresenting clients in lawsuits that successfully struck down unconstitutional election laws and \ndefeated challenges brought by President Trump or his allies to the results of the 2020 election,” \nid.  The different treatment of plaintiff from others similarly situated is plain on the record.  EO \n14230 targeted plaintiff out of a crowd of similar law firms for punitive measures.  Plaintiff posits \nthat there is no need to “infer animus” in this case, Pl.’s Mem. at 37 (quoting Swanson v. City of \nChetek, 719 F.3d 780, 784 (7th Cir. 2013), since the text of EO 14230 and associated fact sheet \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 82 of 102\nmakes obvious the Trump Administration’s animus toward plaintiff, which is only confirmed by \nother contextual evidence, including President Trump’s statements over nearly the past decade. \nThis Court agrees.  See supra Part III.B.1(c).   \nThe government’s assertion that “[p]laintiff is not ‘similarly situated’ to other potential \ngovernment contractors who do not engage in unlawful DEI practices,” Gov’t’s Mem. at 19, is not \npersuasive.  As an initial matter, putting plaintiff in a class of “potential government contractors” \nis, at best, a stretch since the government itself argues that plaintiff has not pled facts to establish \nit is a current or prospective government contractor, Gov’t’s Mem. at 18-19, and, at worst, \npurposefully  evasive,  since  plaintiff  is  counsel  to  government  contractors,  so  appropriate \ncomparators are other law firms, not contractors.  Furthermore, the government has presented no \nevidence that plaintiff is engaged in any practices that amount to “unlawful” discrimination.  See \nsupra Part III.B.1(a).  Even assuming the government believes, for instance, that adoption of the \nMansfield  Rule  is  somehow  unlawful,  despite  the  inconsistencies  in  that  position  with  the \ngovernment’s avowed goals, see supra n.28, plaintiff has been singled out among other signatory \nlaw firms to the Mansfield Rule for punishment.  In the 2023-2024 period, more than 360 law \nfirms achieved Mansfield Certification, including many of plaintiff’s peer law firms in the AmLaw \n100.  See Lawson Decl., Ex. 7, Press Release, More than 360 Law Firms Achieve Mansfield \nCertification for 2023-24, Marking a Double-Digit Increase in the Push for Leadership Diversity, \nDiversity Lab (Oct. 2, 2024), ECF No. 143-2 at 112.  Plaintiff, however, was one of only a small \nnumber of firms singled out for differential treatment.  The same is true of the Sponsors for \nEducational Opportunity (“SEO”) law fellowship program, which was raised in the letter from \nEEOC to the Firm shortly after the issuance of EO 14230 and the filing of this lawsuit, in accord \nwith the Order’s Section 4(a).  According to that letter, “[d]ozens of major law firms partner” with \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 83 of 102\nthe SEO program, EEOC Letter at 5, but again, plaintiff was one of the few law firms plucked out \nand targeted for investigation. \nThe government has given no plausible explanation for the specific targeting of plaintiff as \nopposed to other signatories to the Mansfield Rule or the SEO Fellowship.  See Mots. Hr’g Tr. at \n69:16-21, 72:17-73:6.  “Judges are not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens \nare  free.”    United  States  v.  Stanchich,  550  F.2d  1294,  1300  (2d Cir. 1977)  (Friendly,  J.).  \nParticularly in light of all of the other evidence of the specific targeting of plaintiff for retaliatory \npurposes, see supra Part III.B.1, the government’s explanation simply is not credible.  \nThe most obvious reasons for EO 14230 and the differential treatment meted out to plaintiff \ncompared to other law firms are articulated clearly in Section 1—to address and suppress conduct \nby the Firm that constitutes First Amendment protected activity disliked by President Trump.  \nThus, again, this record firmly supports the finding that EO 14230 serves no legitimate government \ninterest, but only the interest of retaliation.  Our Constitution leaves no room for the exercise of \n“purely personal and arbitrary power.”  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886).  “[S]ome \nobjectives—such as ‘a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group . . .—are not legitimate \nstate interests.”  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 446-47 (1985) (internal \ncitation omitted; first ellipsis in original) (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, \n534 (1973)).  Some of plaintiff’s current and former clients and employment practices are \nunpopular with President Trump and his administration—due to the speech and associations, real \nor perceived, reflected in those relationships and policies—and EO 14230 was issued to harm \nplaintiff.  See supra Part III.B.1.  Under the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection \nunder the law, however, settling personal vendettas by targeting a disliked business or individual \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 84 of 102\nfor punitive government action is not a legitimate use of the powers of the U.S. government or an \nAmerican President.  Plaintiff is therefore entitled to summary judgment on Count IV. \n4.  EO 14230 Violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights to Counsel \nof Plaintiff’s Clients. \n \nThe Sixth Amendment secures the right, “[i]n all criminal prosecutions,” for “the accused \n. . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.”  U.S. CONST. amend. VI.  Included in this \nSixth  Amendment  guarantee  is  “the  right  to  effective  assistance  of  counsel,”  Strickland  v. \nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14 \n(1970)), and a “right to choose one’s own counsel,” subject to some restrictions, Wheat v. United \nStates, 486 U.S. 153, 159 (1988); see also supra n.1 (discussing briefly the historical context and \npurpose of the amendment).  Relatedly, in the civil litigation context, the Fifth Amendment \nguarantees the right for parties to “the aid of counsel when desired and provided by the party \nasserting the right.”  Powell, 287 U.S. at 68.  Seeking to assert the rights of its criminal and civil \nclients, plaintiff contends, in Counts VIII and IX, that EO 14230 unconstitutionally interferes with \nboth Fifth and Sixth Amendment constitutional protections by interfering with the ability of \nplaintiff to represent its clients.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 29-31.  Plaintiff is correct as to each claim. \nStarting with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in criminal matters, the instruction in \nEO 14230’s Section 5(a) for all agencies to “limit[] Government employees acting in their official \ncapacity from engaging with [plaintiff’s] employees,” EO 14230 § 5(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782, \nthreatens to undermine plaintiff’s ability to provide effective assistance of counsel to clients in \ncriminal cases, see 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 20 (“Perkins Coie represents clients who have been \nindicted or are the targets of federal criminal investigations” and has “represented more than 80 \nindividuals and companies who have been criminally investigated, charged, and/or prosecuted by \nfederal authorities at the Department of Justice” in the “past five years”); TRO Hr’g Tr. at 26:23-\n84 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 85 of 102\n24 (plaintiff’s counsel confirming plaintiff has “clients who are indicted and federal targets”).  For \ninstance, “defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea bargain process . . . that must be met to \nrender the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth Amendment requires.”  Missouri v. Frye, \n566 U.S. 134, 143-44 (2012); accord Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156, 170 (2012).  Obviously, the \nplea  bargain  process  requires  defense  counsel  to  engage  with  federal  prosecutors,  through \ncommunicating with them in writing, speaking to them, or meeting in-person with them.  The plain \nlanguage of EO 14230 requiring any planned guidance to “limit[] Government employees acting \nin their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees” and further limiting \nplaintiff’s employees from entering federal buildings, EO 14230 § 5(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782, \nposes an existential threat to that critical function.  The immediacy of this threat is amply \ndemonstrated by the fact that government officials cancelled two separate meetings in separate \nmatters with plaintiff’s employees in the four business days between the issuance of EO 14230 \nand the Court’s TRO.  See Pl.’s SMF ¶¶ 152, 162.  Cancelled meetings and restricting plaintiff’s \naccess to government officials with authority in matters affecting plaintiff’s clients in criminal \nmatters, therefore, threatens to undermine plaintiff’s clients’ vital right to effective assistance of \ncounsel. \nSimilarly, the Order impinges on “the right of a defendant who does not require appointed \ncounsel to choose who will represent him.”  United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 144 \n(2006).  As the Supreme Court has explained, this right “to counsel of choice,” id. at 146, is “the \nroot meaning of the constitutional guarantee” to counsel protected by the Sixth Amendment, id. at \n147-48.  In addition to impinging on the right to effective counsel by limiting access to federal \ngovernment buildings and officials, as directed in Section 5(a), Section 3 undermines plaintiff’s \nability to perform its professional duties in these representations, by requiring any client with a \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 86 of 102\ngovernment contract, whether or not plaintiff’s representation of the client is related to that \ncontract, to terminate the relationship with plaintiff or face the loss of all government contracts.  \nEO 14230 § 3(a), (b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781-82.  Though the Order does not explicitly ban \ngovernment contractor clients from hiring plaintiff, the combination of limiting government \nbuilding and officials access to Firm employees, directing termination of any government contract \non which the Firm has provided services, and threatening termination of all government contracts \nheld by contractors doing any business with the Firm, would effectively have that result.  See Pl.’s \nSMF ¶¶ 151-61 (describing the clients who terminated and/or began to reconsider representations \nin the brief time between the issuance of the EO and the Court’s TRO and the resulting impacts \non plaintiff); Pl.’s MSJ, Ex. 6, Expert Report of Robert E. Hirshon, former President, American \nBar Association & former ethics and professional responsibility professor, Michigan Law School \n(“Hirshon Rep.”) ¶ 19, ECF No. 39-6 (“[T]he Executive Order, if upheld, would punish clients \n(through cancellation of their government contracts) for seeking advice or other legal services from \ntheir chosen lawyer, or from a law firm the President dislikes.”).   \nEven if clients choose to maintain their relationship with plaintiff in the face of EO 14230’s \nthreat of government contract termination, the Rules of Professional Conduct might force plaintiff \nto withdraw as counsel if government restrictions, particularly as agency guidance emerges, \nadversely impact plaintiff’s ability to conduct legal work effectively on behalf of the Firm’s clients.  \nSee, e.g., Pl.’s MSJ., Ex. 7, Expert Rep. of Prof. Roy D. Simon, Jr., Distinguished Professor of \nLegal Ethics Emeritus, Hofstra University’s Maurice A. Deane School of Law (“Simon Rep.”) ¶ \n48, ECF No. 39-7 (“Clients and potential clients will be deprived of their choice of counsel if the \nExecutive Order’s restrictions on Perkins Coie . . . interfere with Perkins Coie’s ability to represent \na client competently, because in those instances the Rules of Professional Conduct will permit or \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 87 of 102\nrequire Perkins Coie to request a tribunal’s permission to withdraw from a pending matter.”).  \nEither way, the fundamental rights of the clients would be adversely affected.  \nThe law is well-settled that the government is not constitutionally permitted to interfere \ndirectly with the right of plaintiff’s clients in criminal matters to choose plaintiff to represent them.  \nSee Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 148 (“Deprivation of the right [to counsel of choice] is ‘complete’ \nwhen the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants, \nregardless of the quality of the representation he received.”).  Nor may the government do \nindirectly what a government official “is barred from doing directly.”  Vullo, 602 U.S. at 190.  Yet, \nthe record demonstrates this is exactly what has happened in this case.  Since EO 14230 was issued, \n“[m]any clients” of plaintiff have “request[ed] frequent updates relating to the Order to assess \nwhether Perkins Coie can continue to represent them.”  Pl.’s SMF ¶ 158 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. \n¶ 48).  Whether due to fears that the government might retaliate against clients who hire plaintiff \nto represent them, such as by canceling any government contracts by firms that do business with \nplaintiff, see EO 14230 Fact Sheet (“[T]he Federal Government will prohibit funding contractors \nthat use Perkins Coie LLP.”), or concern that plaintiff’s lawyers may not have access to federal \nbuildings and officials, see Pl.’s SMF ¶ 152 (explaining that, after plaintiff’s lawyers were refused \nattendance at a scheduled meeting with a federal official on the day after EO 14230 was issued, \nthe client, on which case plaintiff had already done over $1 million worth of work, “hired another \nlaw firm to represent it before the federal government and in related litigation” (citing 2nd Burman \nDecl. ¶ 44)), EO 14230 has already forced plaintiff’s clients to choose between using their chosen \nlawyers and facing potential consequences from the government due to who they have hired as \ncounsel.  Forcing plaintiff’s clients to make such a choice violates their Sixth Amendment rights.  \nPlaintiff is therefore entitled to summary judgment on Count VIII. \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 88 of 102\nFor essentially the same reasons, EO 14230 also unconstitutionally invades the right to \ncounsel in the civil context.  In American Airways Charters, Inc. v. Regan, 746 F.2d 865, 866 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984), the D.C. Circuit considered the rights of a corporation designated as a “Cuban \nnational” to “choose and retain counsel without obtaining in advance a government . . . license to \ndo so”—in this case, from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).  \nIn its decision, the Circuit discussed the potential danger of allowing “an executive agency that is, \nin significant respects, the adverse party” effectively to have veto power over the choice of an \nattorney.  Id. at 872.  In construing the statute in question to prevent OFAC from exercising power \nover the company’s choice of counsel, see id. at 873-74, the Circuit recognized the “invalidity of \na governmental attempt to deny counsel to a civil litigant,” id. at 873 (citing Powell, 287 U.S. at \n68-69, and collecting cases “elaborat[ing] on the same basic theme”); see also Muniz v. Meese, \n115 F.R.D. 63, 66 n.11 (D.D.C. 1987) (noting “violation of civil liberties that is implied by a \ngovernment intrusion into [citizens’] right to select and to be represented by counsel of their \nchoice”).   \nWhile the First Amendment’s free speech and association protections safeguard a client’s \nrights to hire and consult with an attorney, see supra Part III.B.2, separate constitutional problems \nare posed under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments when the government interferes with a client’s \nright to choose counsel.  The government contracting compelled disclosure and termination \ninstruction and government building and government official access bars in EO 14230’s Sections \n3 and 5, respectively, would adversely impact both clients’ ability to choose plaintiff and plaintiff’s \nability to provide representation to clients in criminal cases, and would adversely impact plaintiff’s \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 89 of 102\nrepresentations of clients in civil matters involving the government.  Plaintiff, therefore, is entitled \nto summary judgment on Count IX.33 \n5.  EO 14230 Violates Plaintiff’s Procedural Right to Due Process of Law. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person “shall . . . be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend. V.  Plaintiff \nclaims, in Count II, that EO 14230 violates this protection by “vitiat[ing] the Firm’s right to petition \nthe government,” without affording plaintiff proper process.  Pl.’s Mem. at 21.34  Evaluating these \nprocedural due process claims requires determining, first, whether a protected interest held by \nplaintiff in life, liberty, or property was deprived and, second, whether any process provided was \nadequate.  See Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 236 (2023) (citing Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, \n125 (1990)).35 \nAnalysis of plaintiff’s claim that EO 14230 violates, without proper process, the Firm’s \nright to petition the government, which is an interest protected under the First Amendment, is \nstraightforward.    The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  “[t]he  very  idea  of  government, \nrepublican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to . . . petition for a redress of \n \n33   Both parties acknowledge that some security clearances held by plaintiff’s employees when EO 14230 was \nissued were “granted in the context of their fulfilling their obligations as lawyers to represent their clients.”  Pl.’s \nSMF ¶ 89 (citing 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 36); Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF at 3 (noting that ¶ 89 is undisputed).  The \nsuspension of security clearances necessary for representation in particular matters potentially implicates the rights \nto counsel discussed, but no evidence of such impact has been submitted in this case, and thus this issue is not \naddressed. \n \n34   In addition to its liberty interest in petitioning the government, plaintiff claims additional protected interests \nwere violated, in contravention of due process, including plaintiff and its employees’ right to follow their chosen \nprofession, Am. Compl. ¶ 101; the Firm’s liberty interest in its reputation, id.; and the Firm’s property interest in its \nprivate contractual relationships with clients, id.; see also Pl.’s Mem. at 23-24.  The merits of these additional \nclaimed violations need not be addressed given resolution of summary judgment based on plaintiff’s interest in \npetitioning the government. \n \n35   Though the government disputes that plaintiff has “demonstrated standing to challenge Section 3 insofar as \nit regulates its clients,” Gov’t’s Mem. at 19, plaintiff alleges a procedural due process violation based on plaintiff’s \nown liberty or property interests, see Pl.’s Mem. at 21 (raising only claims relating to the Firm and its attorneys), and \nthus the government’s position on this point is irrelevant. \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 90 of 102\ngrievances,” De Jonge v. State of Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 364 (1937) (quoting United States v. \nCruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552 (1875)), and that this right “is one that cannot be denied without \nviolating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and \npolitical institutions,” id. (citations omitted).  See also BE & K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, \n524 (2002) (“We have recognized [the] right to petition as one of ‘the most precious of the liberties \nsafeguarded by the Bill of Rights.” (quoting Mine Workers, 389 U.S. at 222).  This liberty interest \nin petitioning the government is so fundamental, therefore, that it is protected under the due process \nclauses of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 364 (citations \nomitted); Trentadue v. Integrity Comm., 501 F.3d 1215, 1236-37 (10th Cir. 2007) (recognizing \nthat the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause applies to the “liberty interest in [the] First \nAmendment right to petition the government”). \nThe right to petition the government “extends to all departments of the Government” and, \ncrucially, includes “[t]he right of access to the courts.”  BE & K Constr. Co., 536 U.S. at 525 \n(quoting Calif. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510 (1972)); see also \nBorough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 387 (2011) (“[T]he Petition Clause protects the \nright of individuals to appeal to courts and other forums established by the government for \nresolution of legal disputes.”).  Moreover, retaliation based on the exercise of the right to petition \nthe government via access to the courts violates that right, and the associated liberty interest, in \nthe same way that retaliation based on protected speech violates the First Amendment.  See \nGuarnieri, 564 U.S. at 387-93 (applying, in a case involving a public employee, the same test to \nretaliation for petition rights as is applied for retaliation based on speech).  Since EO 14230’s \nretaliatory nature has already been determined, and that retaliation relied at least in part on lawsuits \nfiled by plaintiff, see supra Part III.B.1, plaintiff’s liberty interest in petitioning the government \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 91 of 102\nwas clearly implicated.  In other words, the government’s retaliatory actions reflected in EO 14230, \nbased in part on plaintiff’s filing of lawsuits on behalf of the Firm’s clients, deprived plaintiff of \nits liberty interest in petitioning the government. \nHere, deciding what process was due to plaintiff is unnecessary, because no process was \nprovided.  See TRO Hr’g Tr. at 11:12-20 (plaintiff’s counsel confirming no notice or process was \ngiven to plaintiff); see also id. at 17:20-18:4 (plaintiff’s counsel explaining that EO 14230 “does \nnot provide any kind of notice with respect to the factual findings in Section 1” or “the restrictions \nthat are placed only on this law firm,” since plaintiff “only learned about them contemporaneous \nwith the release of the executive order”).  Certainly, here, the text of EO 14230 does not satisfy \nthe notice requirement because the retaliation, and thus the deprivation of the right, was completed \nat the time of issuance, regardless of whether guidance in some form remains pending.  See TRO \nHr’g Tr. at 17:5-19:11 (plaintiff’s counsel noting that plaintiff “only learned about” both the \n“factual findings in Section 1” and the “restrictions that are placed only on” plaintiff and not other \nlaw firms “contemporaneous with the release of” EO 14230, and further that, were guidance to be \nreleased in the future, “agencies are already told what the outcome of their analysis is, because \nthey have been told in Section 1 that working with Perkins Coie is not consistent with the national \ninterest and not consistent with the administration and policies of the administration”).  Notably, \neven in cases involving legitimate national security interests, some level of due process is required \nbefore subjecting a person to the adverse consequences of government action.  See, e.g., Ralls \nCorp. v. CFIUS, 758 F.3d 296, 318-19 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (finding a due process violation where a \nforeign-owned corporation was subject to an order preventing a merger without an opportunity to \nrebut the findings on which the order was based).36   \n \n36   One amicus makes a vigorous argument that the Order is an “executive branch act[] of attainder” prohibited \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as a “deprivation[] of liberty without due process of law,” \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 92 of 102\nIn sum, plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on its claim in Count II that EO 14230 \nviolates the Firm’s procedural due process rights by severely impinging on the Firm’s protected \nliberty interest to petition the government by both retaliating against the Firm for exercising its \nright to petition the government and by restricting the Firm’s access to government facilities and \nofficials, without any prior notice or opportunity to be heard.  \n \nAmicus Br. of Prof. Aaron H. Caplan Regarding Attainder (“Caplan Br.”) at 1, ECF No. 132, observing that “[a] \nlegislative branch bill of attainder is tyranny of the majority in its purest form: on majority vote, a person is declared \na wrongdoer and punished without trial.  An executive branch act of attainder is an even more concentrated form of \ntyranny,” id. at 10.  In many ways, EO 14230 is indistinguishable from a bill of attainder: it targets plaintiff \nspecifically, finds facts and declares plaintiff guilty of “racial discrimination,” “unethical” and “egregious” conduct, \nand imposes multiple forms of punitive adverse actions, without notice or other judicial process protections.  See \nNixon v. Adm’r of Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 468 (1977) (defining a bill of attainder as “a law that legislatively \ndetermines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a \njudicial trial”).   \nPlacement of the prohibitions on bills of attainder in two sections of Article I, U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9, cl. 3 \n(“No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.”); id. § 10, cl. 1 (“No State shall . . . pass any Bill of \nAttainder.”), has led to the general view that these prohibitions apply only to the legislative branch.  See, e.g., \nGlobal Relief Found., Inc. v. O’Neill, 315 F.3d 748, 755 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. \n303, 315 (1946)); TRO Hr’g Tr. at 45:15-18 (government counsel arguing that, “just as a pure constitutional matter, \nthat the bill of attainder restriction is only [i]n Article I and not Article II, and so it doesn’t apply to the President”).  \nYet, this assumption is called into question, particularly where executive orders appear to stand in for laws, by the \nconstitutional text, which, in art. I, § 9, cl. 3, does not expressly limit the prohibition to the Congress, and then, in \nthe following section 10 applies the prohibition to the States, as well as consideration of the history of bills of \nattainder, see, e.g., Caplan Br. at 13 (citing “the framing-era understanding of legislative supremacy” to explain “the \nFramers would have felt no need to specify in Art. II that the President could not independently impose attainders” \nsince “[t]he President may only faithfully execute laws that are allowed to exist, so he may not duplicate or \nunilaterally impose through executive action any type of law forbidden by Art.I, § 9, be it attainder, ex post facto \npunishment, suspending habeas corpus in peacetime, granting titles of nobility, or establishing preferences among \nports of different states.”); Br. of Former Senior Government Officials as Amici Curiae in Supp. of Pl.’s MSJ at 17, \nECF No. 104 (“By placing the Bill of Attainder Clauses in Article I, the Framers clearly did not intend to authorize \nthe President to do alone what Congress and the President, acting together, could not.”); Matthew Steilen, Bills of \nAttainder, 53 HOUS. L. REV. 767, 890, 892 (2016) (describing the revision of a previous version of the constitutional \ntext that limited the prohibition to “The Legislature” and explaining “although bills of attainder were largely passed \nby legislatures, this is not true of all”); Harold Hongju Koh, Fred Halbhuber, & Inbar Pe’er, No, the President \nCannot Issue Bills of Attainder, Just Security (Apr. 9, 2025), https://www.justsecurity.org/110109/president-cannot-\nissue-attainder-bills/; see also Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 144 (1951) (Black, J., \nconcurring) (“I cannot believe that the authors of the Constitution, who outlawed the bill of attainder, inadvertently \nendowed the executive with power to engage in the same tyrannical practices that had made the bill such an odious \ninstitution.”). \nThe scope of the bills of attainder prohibition and application of this prohibition to unilateral presidential \naction not otherwise authorized by Congress, is worth further study and consideration.  In this case, however, where \nplaintiff has not raised a stand-alone bill of attainder claim, see Compl. ¶ 96 (mentioning bill of attainder only as \npart of the Count I ultra vires claim), nor have the parties extensively briefed the question, see Pl.’s Mem. at 26 \n(suggesting as part of its ultra vires claim in Count I, that EO 14230 “shares the essential features of a bill of \nattainder”); see generally Gov’t’s Mem.; Gov’t’s Opp’n (not addressing the issue), and both parties took the position \nthat the prohibition on bills of attainder only applies to Congress, see TRO Hr’g Tr. at 45:15-18 (government \ncounsel making this argument); Pl.’s TRO Mot. at 18 (“To be sure, the Bill of Attainder Clause, by its terms, does \nnot apply to the Executive Branch.” (citation omitted)), consideration of this issue must be left to another day.  \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 93 of 102\n6.  EO 14230 is Impermissibly Vague. \nPlaintiff claims, in Count III, that EO 14230 is impermissibly vague, in violation of the \nFifth Amendment Due Process clause, because the Order “fails to provide adequate notice as to \nwhat are prohibited ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies,” Am. Compl. ¶ 109, but nevertheless \ndirects government agencies to take multiple adverse actions against plaintiff based on this \n“vaguely defined” term, including “threatened investigation and enforcement action by the EEOC \nand [DOJ],” “threatened suspension of active security clearances,” “threatened termination of \ncontracts or funding with Perkins Coie or entities doing business with Perkins Coie,” “threatened \nlimitation of access to Federal property and engaging with government employees,” and threatened \nprevention of hiring of Perkins Coie employees for Federal positions,” id. ¶¶ 110-14.  When asked \nabout what precisely was wrong with “diversity, equity and inclusion,” the government provided \nlittle help, stating “diversity, in and of itself, isn’t the problem.  The problem is stereotyping based \noff of these points.”  Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 64:3-5.  In defense of this due process challenge, the \ngovernment avoids trying to define the terms “diversity, equity and inclusion” altogether and \ncontends that the Order’s reference “to ‘categories prohibited by civil rights laws,’” Gov’t’s Mem. \nat 12 (quoting EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781), provides a sufficient “intelligible benchmark” \nto save the Order from plaintiff’s vagueness challenge, id. at 13.  The government’s defense is not \npersuasive. \n“A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws which regulate persons or entities \nmust give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012).  Courts apply this doctrine to review both civil and criminal laws.  \nSee, e.g., Boutilier v. INS, 387 U.S. 118, 123 (1967) (“It is true that this Court has held the ‘void \nfor vagueness’ doctrine applicable to civil as well as criminal actions.”); Gentile v. State Bar of \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 94 of 102\nNev., 501 U.S. 1030, 1048-51 (1991) (finding a state Supreme Court rule governing attorney \nconduct void for vagueness); Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603-04 (1967) (finding a \nrestriction on government employee speech “wholly lacking in terms susceptible of objective \nmeasurement” (internal quotation marks, citation omitted)).  In the civil context, an enactment is \nonly void if it is “so vague and indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all.”  Boutilier, 387 \nU.S. at 123; see also Senior C.L. Ass’n, Inc. v. Kemp, 965 F.2d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir. 1992) (“To \nfind a civil statute void for vagueness, the statute must be ‘so vague and indefinite as really to be \nno rule or standard at all.’” (quoting Boutilier, 387 U.S. at 123)).  EO 14230 fails this test, as \nanother Judge on this Court and other courts to review the Trump Administration’s use of these \nterms in various orders and agency rules have also concluded.  See, e.g., NAACP v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 1196212, at *1-2, 6 (D.D.C.

See, e.g., Order, Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Offs. in Higher Educ., No. 25-\n1189, ECF No. 29 (4th Cir. Mar. 14, 2025) at 4 and n.2 (Diaz, C.J., concurring) (observing that “neither Order ever \ndefines DEI or its component terms,” noting that “[a]s a result, it’s unclear what types of programs—formal or \ninformal—the administration seeks to eliminate,” but “where the Orders only purport to direct executive policy and \nactors, we don’t find vagueness principles outcome determinative,” and cautioning “that agency action that goes \nbeyond the narrow scope…could implicate Fifth amendment vagueness concerns”); id. at 9 (Rushing, J., concurring) \n(“[T]his case does not challenge any particular agency action implementing the Executive Orders.”); id. at 7 (Harris, \nJ., concurring) (noting the difference between “[w]hat the Orders say on their face and how they are \nenforced”).  This concern does not exist in the instant case, where EO 14230’s Section 1 has already found “good \ncause to conclude” that plaintiff “racially discriminates” with implementation of “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ \npolicies,” EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, and directed enforcement actions on that basis, id. §§ 2-5, 90 Fed. \nReg. at 11781-82.  Moreover, concerns about “enjoin[ing] nondefendants from taking actions”, Order at 9, Nat’l \nAss’n of Diversity Offs. in Higher Educ., No. 25-1189, ECF No. 29 (4th Cir. Mar. 14, 2025) (Rushing, J., \nconcurring) (emphasis in original), no longer exist here given the filing of plaintiff’s Amended Complaint. \n \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 96 of 102\nprohibited by civil rights laws.”  EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781; EO 14230 Fact Sheet \n(mentioning plaintiff’s “discriminatory actions”).  While the government suggests that the Order’s \nreference to “categories prohibited by civil rights laws” provides clarity about what is prohibited, \nGov’t’s Mem. at 12 (quoting EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781), neither the Order and fact \nsheet nor the record submitted in this case provides any actual evidence of illegal discrimination \nby  plaintiff  that  would  make  clear  what  Firm  employment  policies  or  practices,  in  the \ngovernment’s view, run afoul of the law.  See also supra Part III.B.1(a).38  \nThe Order goes on to mention the Administration’s goal of “ending discrimination under \n‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies,” EO 14230 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, leading to a \npossible inference that such policies, and not any concrete evidence of discrimination, are the \nproblematic conduct that plaintiff should avoid.  The terms diversity, equity, and inclusion, taken \ncollectively or individually, however, could refer to a wide range of actions and programs, formal \nor informal, as well as basic thoughts and beliefs.  The Order provides no definition or guidance \nas  to  what  form  of  program  possibly  described  by  these  terms  is  considered  unlawful \ndiscrimination by the Trump Administration, leaving plaintiff to guess at what is and is not \npermissible in the government’s view, while already facing the threat of adverse actions during the \nguessing.   \n \n38   Though the government broadly asserts that “[d]iversity initiatives have always been legally suspect and \n[are] especially so since the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College (“SFFA”), 600 U.S. 181 (2023),” Gov’t’s Mem. at 11—which seems to be an \nexpansive view of the actual holding in that case, which considered challenges to the college “admissions systems \nused by Harvard College and the University of North Carolina,” 600 U.S. at 190—the government confirmed that no \ndetermination must be made regarding the lawfulness of certain employment policies and practices adopted by \nplaintiff, such as the Mansfield Rule and the SEO Fellowship program, to resolve the pending summary judgment \nmotion, Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 71:6-23, 72:4-16, even though the Fact Sheet alludes (with distorted descriptions) to both \nprograms as a basis for the Order, see EO 14230 Fact Sheet (citing as basis for “accus[ing Firm] of racial[] \ndiscriminat[ion]” that “Perkins Coie has publicly announced racial percentage quotas for hiring and promotions . . . \nand excluded applicants from fellowships based on race”). \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 97 of 102\nThe government’s own briefing reflects this uncertainty.  While repeatedly accusing \nplaintiff of engaging in racial discrimination, see Gov’t’s Mem. at 2, 8-10, 17, 19, 21, 23; Gov’t’s \nOpp’n at 13, 14; Gov’t’s Reply at 3, 4, the government at various times also states that (1) plaintiff \nshould be investigated by the EEOC to determine “whether [they] are violating the civil rights \nlaws,” Gov’t’s Mem. at 2 (emphasis supplied); (2) the government is merely trying to advance \n“valid social policies regarding discrimination,” rather than enforcing any legal prohibitions, \nGov’t’s Mem. at 3; see also Gov’t’s Opp’n at 3, 4; (3) “[d]iversity initiatives” are “legally suspect,” \nand thus plaintiff’s practices “provide ample basis for review,” Gov’t’s Mem. at 11 (emphasis \nsupplied); see also Gov’t’s Opp’n at 16; (4) the government is merely “rais[ing] legitimate legal \nissues of just how far DEI policies and programs can go and whether such policies cross the line \ninto illegal discrimination,” Gov’t’s Mem. at 27 (emphasis supplied); (5) plaintiff engaged in \n“aggressive DEI practices,” Gov’t’s Reply at 1; and (6) plaintiff “appears to have” engaged in \nwhat the government characterizes as discrimination, Gov’t’s Opp’n at 17-19 (emphasis supplied).  \nWhen even the government cannot decide what exactly the grounds for its actions were, plaintiff \nis truly left unable to know what conduct to avoid. \nIn short, EO 14230 fails to set a coherent standard for plaintiff to follow.  For that reason, \nplaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on Count III. \nC.  Permanent Injunction Factors \nPlaintiff has amply demonstrated entitlement to summary judgment on its claims that EO \n14230 violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Given this determination, EO 14230 cannot \nbe “implemented consistent with applicable law,” EO 14230 § 6(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11782, as \nrequired by the embedded terms of the Order, which is thus is null and void.  Both parties agree \nthat, notwithstanding the effect of Section 6(b), plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief must still \nbe addressed.  Mots. Hr’g Tr. at 15:3-17:20 (government counsel discussing Section 6(b) and \n97 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 98 of 102\nurging that “the application of the factors to each section that was being enjoined would still need \nto  be  undertaken”);  id.  at  91:17-92:23  (plaintiff’s  counsel  urging  same  to  ensure  future \n“enforceability”).    \nTo obtain the permanent injunctive relief sought, plaintiff “must demonstrate: (1) that it \nhas suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, \nare inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between \nthe plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would \nnot be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. \n139, 156-57 (2010) (quoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)).  The \nfinal two factors “merge” into one when “the Government is the opposing party,” Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (applying merged factors in stay context), because “the government’s \ninterest is the public interest,” Pursuing America’s Greatness v.

U.S. Postal Serv., 64 F.4th 1354, 1364 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023) (applying the merged factors in permanent injunction context).  Plaintiff succeeds \non each showing. \n1.  Plaintiff Has Demonstrated Irreparable Injury Will Occur Absent an \nInjunction, With No Adequate Remedy at Law.  \n \n“It has long been established that the loss of constitutional freedoms, ‘for even minimal \nperiods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’”  Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 \nF.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373); see also Roman Cath. Diocese \nof Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 19 (2020) (“The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. \nat 373); Karem v. Trump, 960 F.3d 656, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (“[A] violation of Fifth Amendment \n98 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 99 of 102\ndue process rights . . . support[s] injunctive relief.”).  Here, plaintiff has demonstrated that EO \n14230 violates the Firm’s rights under the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, as well as its clients’ \nrights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  See supra Parts III.B.1-6.  These violations were \nongoing until Sections 1, 3 and 5 were temporarily enjoined and would continue were the \ninjunction  lifted,  meaning  they  are  sufficient,  by  themselves,  to  establish  irreparable  harm.  \nFurthermore, these injuries are irreparable “because [they] cannot be fully compensated by later \ndamages,” Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Invisible Empire, Inc. v. District of Columbia, \n751 F. Supp. 218, 224 (D.D.C. 1990) (collecting cases); see also, e.g., Book People, Inc. v. Wong, \n91 F.4th 318, 340 (5th Cir. 2024) (“An irreparable harm is one for which there is no adequate \nremedy at law.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted))—a reality reinforced in this \nscenario by the existence of sovereign immunity.  \nPlaintiff has also shown monetary harm sufficient to establish irreparable harm.  Where, as \nhere, sovereign immunity limits plaintiff to seeking nonmonetary equitable relief and thus renders \nunrecoverable  plaintiff’s  monetary  damages,  courts  have  recognized  these  losses  “can  .  .  . \nconstitute irreparable harm.”  Xiaomi Corp. v. Dep’t of Def., No. 21-cv-280 (RC), 2021 WL \n950144, at *10 (D.D.C. Mar. 12, 2021) (citations omitted); see also California v. Azar, 911 F.3d \n558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018) (stating that economic harm caused by federal agencies protected by \nsovereign immunity “is irreparable . . . because the states will not be able to recover monetary \ndamages”); Chamber of Com. v.

Even where unrecoverable economic harm exists, courts in this district have required the \neconomic harm faced to be “serious in terms of its effect on the plaintiff,” Gulf Oil Corp. v. Dep’t \nof Energy, 514 F. Supp. 1019, 1026 (D.D.C. 1981), “significant,” Air Trans. Ass’n v. Exp.-Imp. \nBank, 840 F. Supp. 2d 327, 335 (D.D.C. 2012); Cal. Ass’n of Priv. Postsecondary Schs. v. DeVos, \n344 F. Supp. 3d 158, 170 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Air Trans., 840 F. Supp. 2d at 335), or \n“sufficiently severe,” Save Jobs USA v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 105 F. Supp. 3d 108, 115 \n(D.D.C. 2015). \nUnder any formulation of this standard, plaintiff succeeds in showing irreparable monetary \nharm.  The undisputed facts in this case show that plaintiff suffered significant losses in the week \nbetween the issuance of EO 14230 and entry of the TRO as a direct result of the Order.  One client \nwho had used the Firm for seven years and was represented by the Firm in seven open matters \nsaid, “within hours of the Order’s release, that due to the Order, [plaintiff] cannot represent that \nclient in any litigation or before the relevant federal agency.”  2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 48.a (emphasis \nsupplied); see also Pl.’s SMF ¶ 151 (referencing this client); Gov’t’s Resp. to Pl.’s SMF at 5 \n(noting the facts of ¶ 151 are undisputed).  Another client, who had used the Firm for 35 years, \nreassigned two matters to other law firms the day after EO 14230 was released.  Pl.’s SMF ¶ 153.  \nYet another client, with the Firm since 2018, “withdrew all work from [plaintiff] as a result of the \nOrder,” as of the day after the Order’s issuance.  2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 48.c (emphasis supplied); see \nalso Pl.’s SMF ¶ 154.  A coalition of four clients similarly withdrew “all coalition work from \n[plaintiff] as of March 7, 2025 due to the need of the clients to engage with various federal \nagencies—including the DEA, DOJ, and HHS—by the nature of their business.”  2nd Burman Decl. \n¶ 48.d; see also Pl.’s SMF ¶ 155.  “The abrupt loss of so many longstanding and significant clients \nacross a variety of business types of practice disciplines in a one-week period is exceptional and \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 101 of 102\nabnormal” for plaintiff, 2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 49, and the revenue loss from terminated clients alone \nwas “significant,” id. ¶ 50, in the short time period EO 14230 was in effect—a statement readily \nsupported by the facts.    \nMoreover, without an injunction, these losses are almost certain to continue.  On March 7, \n2025, a major client with fifteen open matters with plaintiff “informed the firm . . . that it is \nreconsidering its engagements with [plaintiff] unless something changes in terms of the Order’s \nrequirements.”  2nd Burman Decl. ¶ 48.e.  Another long-time client “that had increased its work \nfive-fold over the past three years and had 30 open matters started to reconsider whether to \nterminate every engagement with [plaintiff].”  Id. ¶ 48.g.  Finally, “[b]ecause of the uncertainty \ncreated by the Order, and even after the entry of the TRO, many clients have begun requesting \nfrequent updates relating to the Order in order to assess whether [plaintiff] can continue to \nrepresent them,” id. ¶ 48.h., providing strong evidence that, were the current temporary injunction \nlifted and implementation and enforcement of EO 14230 allowed to proceed, plaintiff would \ncontinue to suffer serious, or significant, or severe revenue losses.  Therefore, plaintiff additionally \nsucceeds in showing irreparable injury based on monetary harms.  Again, because sovereign \nimmunity bars recovery of money damages, these losses could not be adequately compensated by \nlegal remedies.  \n2.  Balance of equities/public interest \nThe balance of the equities and the public interest also favor the issuance of an injunction \nfor a simple reason: “enforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public \ninterest.”  Karem, 960 F.3d at 668 (quoting Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013)).  \nPlaintiff has demonstrated that EO 14230 is unconstitutional in all its action items, from findings \nto instructions to federal agencies, and therefore the government should have no interest in the \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 185     Filed 05/02/25     Page 102 of 102\nOrder’s continued enforcement.  Plaintiff, meanwhile, has demonstrated the strong interests of the \nFirm, its employees, and clients, as well as the American legal system and the public more broadly, \nin issuance of an injunction to protect the independence of counsel to represent their clients \nvigorously and zealously, without fear of retribution from the government simply for doing the job \nof a lawyer.   \nPlaintiff, therefore, is entitled to a permanent injunction barring enforcement of any portion \nof EO 14230 by any Executive branch agency or entity subject to EO 14230. \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nThe U.S. Constitution affords critical protections against Executive action like that ordered \nin EO 14230.  Government officials, including the President, may not “subject[] individuals to \n‘retaliatory actions’ after the fact for having engaged in protected speech.”  Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys., \n595 U.S. at 474 (quoting Nieves, 587 U.S. at 398).  They may neither “use the power of the State \nto punish or suppress disfavored expression,” Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188, nor engage in the use of \n“purely personal and arbitrary power,” Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 370.  In this case, these and other \nfoundational protections were violated by EO 14230.  On that basis, this Court has found that EO \n14230 violates the Constitution and is thus null and void.  For the reasons explained, plaintiff is \nentitled to summary judgment and declaratory and permanent injunctive relief on Counts II \nthrough IX of the Amended Complaint.  The government’s motion to dismiss is denied. \nAn order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered contemporaneously. \nDate:  May 2, 2025 \n \n \n__________________________ \nBERYL A. HOWELL \nUnited States District Judge \n102 \n ",

Bondi, Brendan Carr, Russell T. Vought, Andrea R. Lucas, \nCharles Ezell, Stephen Ehekian, and Tulsi Gabbard (collectively, “Defendants”), respectfully \nmove this Court to dismiss the Complaint.   \nINTRODUCTION \nOn March 6, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,230 (the “Executive Order”).  The \nExecutive  Order  lays  out  the  President’s  concerns  about  the  law  firm  Perkins  Coie  LLP \n(“Plaintiff”)  in  matters  related  to  election  integrity,  national  security,  and  discriminatory \nemployment practices.  In light of those considerations, the Executive Order directs a review of \nPerkins Coie to ensure that the Federal Government’s dealings with the firm are consistent with \nthe national security of the United States and other public interests.  And it seeks to ensure that \ntaxpayer funds are not in any way diverted to support unlawful or unsavory practices that—if they \nshould be permitted at all—must be financed by the private dime.  \nPlaintiff’s 172-paragraph complaint raising nine separate legal claims only obscures what \nis a straightforward—and straightforwardly legal—Executive Order.  Try as it might to frame the \nExecutive Order as “punitive” or a “sanction,” the preamble in Section 1 and the operative sections \nof the Executive Order, Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5, act within the bounds of established executive \nauthority. \nAs to the Section 1 preamble, Plaintiff’s lawsuit carries with it a dangerous risk of muzzling \nthe Executive.  No less than Plaintiff, the government has a right to speak which encompasses the \nstatements in Section 1.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 4 of 34\nSection 2 of the Executive Order directs that agencies “review” whether “active security \nclearances” held by Plaintiff’s employees “are consistent with the national interest.”  EO 14230 \n§ 2.  Plaintiff does not and cannot argue that it should have security clearance privileges if contrary \nto the national interest.  As detailed herein, courts have long held that on such matters the President \nis entitled to great deference.   \nSection 3 of the Executive Order seeks to cancel any contracts for which Perkins Coie is \nhired to perform services.  The Executive Order specifies that, among other goals, Section 3 seeks \nto ensure that there is no transfer of taxpayer dollars to entities that engage in racial discrimination. \nExecutive use of the procurement power to advance social policy has long been held to be on the \nfirmest possible grounds of authority:  The express or implied authorization of Congress.  \nSection 4 directs the Attorney General and the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (“EEOC”) to review whether Perkins Coie and like employers are violating the civil \nrights laws—in other words, to do what it was already the EEOC’s job to do.  Again, this is firmly \nwithin the prerogative of the Executive. \nIn Section 5 the Executive Order directs agencies to issue guidance as to what access \nPlaintiff’s employees should have to government buildings and government officials, consistent \nwith national security and applicable law, as well as examine the propriety of hiring employees \nfrom Plaintiff’s firm.  While Plaintiff’s claims are unripe as no agency has issued the guidance the \norder calls for.  The parameters of access to executive branch staff, offices, and employment are \nwell within the rights of the Executive.  Try as Plaintiff might to describe potential impacts on the \nright to counsel, all of these assertions are pure conjecture and speculation.  The guidance—which \nmust be consistent with the law—has yet to be issued and therefore there is no actual controversy \nbefore this Court. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 5 of 34\nThe Executive Order directs agencies to do what they should already be doing, declines to \ncontract with entities who act inconsistently with valid social policies regarding discrimination, \nand calls for the lawful examination of security clearances and government access of employees \nof Plaintiff’s firm.  The law does not support Plaintiff’s claims as to Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; and \nas to Section 5 specifically, Plaintiff’s claim is at best too early and, as any guidance will be \nconsistent with the law, will eventually fail on the merits.  Accordingly, this Court should dismiss \nthe Complaint.    \nLEGAL STANDARDS AND RULE STATEMENTS \nShotgun Pleading \n  Each count of the Complaint begins with a paragraph stating, “Plaintiff repeats and \nrealleges the allegations set forth in each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.”  \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 85, 99, 106, 117, 126, 136, 144, 157, 165.  The Complaint does not limit “the \npreceding paragraphs” to those relevant to or illustrative of the legal and factual basis for each \nindividual count, but incorporates every paragraph, including any preceding counts, count after \ncount.  As an example, Count IX necessarily includes every preceding paragraph, including those \nin Counts I–VIII.  From a practical perspective, this severely handicaps the Defendants’ and the \nCourt’s ability to ascertain the particulars of Plaintiff’s challenges to the various sections of the \nExecutive Order, including which allegations and claims in the Complaint pertain to which \nsections of the Executive Order. \nThe D.C. Circuit has emphasized that FED. R. CIV. P. 8 “underscore[s] the emphasis placed \non clarity and brevity by the federal pleading rules.”  Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 668–69 (D.C. \nCir. 2004).  This case demonstrates why.  Plaintiff’s imprecise practice here only complicates \nDefendants’ task in moving for dismissal and the Court’s ability to assess these arguments.  Indeed, \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 6 of 34\nPlaintiff’s Complaint in this respect is a paradigm example of a “shotgun pleading.”  See Weiland \nv. Palm Beach Cnty. Sheriff’s Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1321–23 (11th Cir. 2015).  Defendants reserve \nthe right to include in any follow-on briefing additional argument or bases for dismissal or \njudgment to the extent Plaintiff clarifies their claims in a manner not clearly evident on the face of \nits Complaint and TRO Motion.  To provide some structure regarding this overbroad shotgun \nComplaint, Defendants have organized this motion to dismiss by addressing what appear to be \nPlaintiff’s challenges to each section of the Executive Order. \nRule 12(b) & 56 \nOn a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must “accept the well-pleaded factual \nallegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in the plaintiff’s \nfavor.”  Air Excursions LLC v. Yellen, 66 F.4th 272, 277 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  The factual allegations \n“must still be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” and “the Court need not \naccept inferences drawn by plaintiff if those inferences are not supported by the facts set out in the \ncomplaint.”  Langeman v. Garland, 88 F.4th 289, 294 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  The Court may also \nconsider “any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint,” “matters of which \n[the Court] may take judicial notice,” and matters of public record.  EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier \nParochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 625 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Sheppard v. United States, 640 F. Supp. 2d 29, \n32 (D.D.C. 2009).  For a motion brought under Rule 12(b)(1), the Court may consider the \ncomplaint  “supplemented  by  undisputed  facts  evidenced  in  the  record  or  the  complaint \nsupplemented by undisputed facts plus the court’s resolution of disputed facts.”  Sheppard, 640 \nF. Supp. 2d at 32.  Summary judgment under Rule 56(a) may be granted only if “there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact,” including based on information outside the pleadings, and “the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 7 of 34\n  Plaintiff raises an ultra vires claim (Count I), due process claims (Counts II and III), an \nequal protection claim (Count IV), First Amendment claims (Counts V, VI, VII), and right-to-\ncounsel claims (Counts VIII and IX).   \n  An ultra vires challenge such as that brought in Count I are “available only for the narrow \npurpose of obtaining injunctive relief against agency action taken in excess of its delegated powers \nand contrary to a specific prohibition in the law.”  Fed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, \n39 F.4th 756, 765 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  They are subject to a “demanding standard.”  Id. at 765.  Such \nclaims are “confined to extreme agency error where the agency has stepped so plainly beyond the \nbounds of its statutory authority, or acted so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant the immediate \nintervention  of  an  equity  court.”    Id.  at  764  (cleaned  up).    “Only  error  that  is  patently  a \nmisconstruction of [a statute], that disregards a specific and unambiguous statutory directive, or \nthat violates some specific command of a statute will support relief.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Further, to \nstate an ultra vires claim properly, a plaintiff must show “there is no alternative procedure for \nreview” of its claim.  Id. at 763.   \n  Plaintiff raises a procedural due process challenge and a void-for-vagueness due process \nchallenge in Counts II and III.  “A procedural due process claim consists of two elements: \n(i) deprivation by state action of a protected interest in life, liberty, or property, and (ii) inadequate \nstate process.”  Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 236 (2023); see also English v. District of Columbia, \n717 F.3d 968, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“The procedural due process protections under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments are the same.”).  Whether the process provided is adequate depends on \n“(1) the importance of the private interest at stake, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the \ninterest because of the procedures used and the probable value of additional procedural safeguards, \nand (3) the government’s interests, including the cost of additional procedures.”  English, 717 F.3d \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 8 of 34\nat 972.  And “[t]he Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from taking away someone’s \nlife, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair \nnotice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.”  Kincaid \nv. Gov’t of the District of Columbia, 854 F.3d 721, 728 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Kavanaugh, J.) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \n  Plaintiff also raises an equal protection claim in Count IV, based on a class-of-one theory.  \nTo bring such a claim, a plaintiff must “allege that she has been intentionally treated differently \nfrom others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.”  \nWillowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000).  “Class-of-one plaintiffs must show an extremely \nhigh degree of similarity between themselves and the persons to whom they compare themselves.”  \nQuezada v. Marshall, 915 F. Supp. 2d 129, 135 (D.D.C. 2013).  And “[e]ven at the motion to \ndismiss stage, a plaintiff alleging an equal protection violation must plead facts that establish that \nthere is not any reasonable conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the \nclassification.”  Lillemoe v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 344 F. Supp. 3d 215, 229 (D.D.C. 2018).   \n  Plaintiff raises three claims based upon the First Amendment in Counts V, VI, and VII.  \nFirst, Plaintiff claims that Defendants engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.  \nSecond, Plaintiff argues that the Executive Order’s requirement that government contractors \ndisclose their business with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related to a government \ncontract compels speech.  And third, Plaintiff alleges First Amendment retaliation.  To succeed on \na First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must allege “(1) he engaged in conduct protected \nunder the First Amendment; (2) the defendant took some retaliatory action sufficient to deter a \nperson of ordinary firmness in plaintiff’s position from speaking again; and (3) a causal link \nbetween the exercise of a constitutional right and the adverse action taken against him.”  Aref v. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 9 of 34\nLynch, 833 F.3d 242, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  In the specific context of contractor speech, “for a \ngovernment employee’s or contractor’s speech to have First Amendment protection, the employee \nor contractor must have (1) spoken as a citizen and (2) addressed matters of public concern.”  \nRamey v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 755 F. Supp. 2d 88, 93 (D.D.C. 2010).  At the same time, “[t]he \ngovernment needs to be free to terminate both employees and contractors for poor performance.”  \nBd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996).   \n  Finally, Plaintiff raises two claims based on the right to counsel in Counts VIII and IX.  \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees “that a person brought to trial in any state or federal court must \nbe afforded the right to the assistance of counsel.”  Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807 (1975).  \nThat right is “not absolute”; it “cannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct an orderly \nprocedure in courts of justice,” and the “public has a strong interest in the prompt, effective, and \nefficient administration of justice.”  United States v. Burton, 584 U.S. 485, 489 (D.C. Cir. 1978).   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiff’s claims fail as to Section 1 of the Executive Order. \nSection 1 of the Executive Order contains a brief factual explanation for the operational \nelements of the Executive Order that describes Perkins Coie’s activities both in its capacity as a \nlaw firm offering legal representation and in its capacity as an employer.  As to its legal services, \nSection 1 explains that Perkins Coie was the law firm that “hired Fusion GPS,” an opposition \nresearch firm that “manufactured a false ‘dossier’ designed to steal an election.”  EO 14230 § 1.  \nIt also describes how Perkins Coie has crossed ethical lines in election litigation such that it \nreceived a court sanction.  Id.  These statements are not seriously contested and are matters of \npublic record.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 10 of 34\nAs to Perkins Coie’s employment practices, the Executive Order noted that Perkins Coie \n“racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants.”  Id.  In \nparticular, Perkins Coie “publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion \non the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws.”  Id.  It also “proudly \nexcluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships,” and “maintained these discriminatory \npractices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change.”  Id.  These points, too, \nare not seriously contested.  The latter refers to a lawsuit instituted by the American Alliance for \nEqual Rights, which sued Perkins Coie because the law firm’s 1L diversity fellowship required \n“[m]embership in a group historically underrepresented in the legal profession, including students \nof color, students who identify as LGBTQ+, and students with disabilities.”  See Compl. ¶ 25, Am. \nAll. for Equal Rights v. Perkins Coie LLP, No. 3:23-cv-1877 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 22, 2023), ECF No. \n1.  The suit was dismissed by stipulation after Perkins Coie replaced the fellowship program with \na new program that did not contain discriminatory requirements.  Stipulation of Dismissal ¶¶ 3–4, \nAm. All. for Equal Rights v. Perkins Coie LLP, No. 3:23-cv-1877 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 11, 2023), ECF \nNo. 31.   \nOnly Counts II and III of the Complaint actually challenge Section 1.  In Count II, Plaintiff \nclaims that “[t]he Order harms Perkins Coie’s cognizable reputation interest by stigmatizing \nPerkins Coie as dishonest, untrustworthy and racially discriminatory.”  Compl. ¶ 101.  And in \nCount III, Plaintiff claims that Section 1’s references to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies \nand “other categories prohibited by civil rights laws” are unconstitutionally vague.  Id. ¶ 109.   \nNeither charge carries any water.  Count II raises a procedural due process challenge that \nrequires Plaintiff to identify a “constitutionally protected interest,” Bowman v. Iddon, 848 F.3d \n1034, 1039 (D.C. Cir. 2017), and the typical plaintiff “lack[s] . . . any constitutional protection for \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 11 of 34\nthe interest in reputation,” Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 234 (1991).  A narrow exception to that \ngeneral rule exists for “reputation-plus claim[s],” which “require[] a plaintiff to identify an act of \ndefamation made in conjunction with an adverse employment action.”  Langeman, 88 F.4th at 296.  \n“A defamatory statement must be false as well as defamatory,” and for that reason “a statement of \npure opinion cannot” be “the basis for a defamation claim.”  Campbell v. District of Columbia, \n126 F. Supp. 3d 141, 150 (D.D.C. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nCount II fails because Plaintiff has not identified any defamatory act on the part of \nDefendants.  See Lamb v. Millennium Challenge Corp., 498 F. Supp. 3d 104, 115 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(noting that “a reputation-plus claim requires showing that the government made defamatory \nstatements concerning the plaintiff”).  Indeed, although the Complaint asserts that Section 1 is \nfalse in conclusory fashion, such statements need not be credited under the pleading standard, and \nPlaintiff does precious little to contest any particular fact in Section 1.  For instance, the Complaint \ndoes not dispute that Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, that Fusion GPS was involved in creating \nthe fake dossier, and that the dossier was designed to interfere with the 2016 election.  Compl. \n¶ 43.  Nor does the Complaint dispute that Perkins Coie was sanctioned in the course of its election \nlitigation.  Id. ¶ 44.  The Complaint does reflect Plaintiff’s wish that Section 1 were longer, \nproviding a laundry list of items which the Executive Order “d[id] not mention.”  Id.  ¶¶ 43, 44.  \nBut the fact that the Executive Order was not almanac-length does not begin to suggest that \nanything in it was false.   \nThe only supposed falsity that the Complaint identifies is in Section 1’s assertion that \nPerkins Coie “racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff.”  Compl. ¶ 45 (quoting \nEO § 1).  But even then, that charge is conclusory and unsupported.  The Complaint cites to its \npractices in “2019 and 2023” as a defense against the charge that they have been engaged in racial \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 12 of 34\ndiscrimination.  Id.  But those examples only prove the point.  See Horton v. Espindola, 319 \nF. Supp. 3d 395, 400 (D.D.C. 2018) (“Under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine, a defendant \ncan submit—and the court can consider—a document that is not attached by the plaintiff, but is \nreferred to in the complaint and integral to the plaintiff’s claim.”).  Perkins Coie  publicly \nannounced in 2019 that it signed the “Mansfield Rule,” which requires law firms to “certify that \nwomen, lawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers and lawyers with disabilities comprise at least 30 \npercent  of  the  candidate  pool  for  significant  leadership  roles,  senior  lateral  openings  and \npromotions.”    Perkins  Coie,  Press  Release,  Perkins  Coie  Adopts  Mansfield  Rule  to  Boost \nLeadership  Diversity  (Sept.  6,  2019)  (available  in  .pdf  form  at \nhttps://www.bing.com/search?q=perkins+coie+2019+press+release+mansfield+rule&form=QBL\nH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-\n0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=B44AA6A85C4045D88B94CC00DC9A3124&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=).     \nIn 2023, Perkins Coie represented to Vault that it has “set formal, measurable targets for increasing \ndiversity in recruitment, retention, promotion, and/or leadership.”  Perkins Coie 2023 Vault Law \nFirm Diversity Survey (available at https://media2.vault.com/14349412/perkins-coie.pdf); see \nPerkins  Coie  2024  Vault  Law  Firm  Diversity  Survey  (available  at \nhttps://media2.vault.com/14351750/perkins-coie.pdf).  In particular, Perkins Coie also told Vault \nthat “[s]trategic focus and intentionality are contributing to the advancement of our historically \nunderrepresented attorneys,” and followed that up by touting the percentages of new partners who \nare women or attorneys of color.  Perkins Coie 2023 Vault Law Firm Diversity Survey at 7. \nMoreover, Plaintiff’s Complaint provides additional grounds for statements in Section 1 \nabout Plaintiff’s diversity practices as Plaintiff repeatedly asserts its commitment to diversity.  \nCompl. ¶¶ 45 (“It is true that Perkins Coie has a longstanding commitment to diversity and \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 13 of 34\ninclusion and has made, and continues to make, public statements advancing the ideals of diversity, \nequity, and inclusion.”), 46 (“Section 1 relies on the false premise that, by promoting diversity in \nthe  legal  profession,  Perkins  Coie  has  engaged  in  “blatant  race-based  and  sex-based \ndiscrimination”  and  therefore,  violated  the  public  trust.”),  and  145  (“Perkins  Coie  has  a \nlongstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion and has made, and continues to make, public \nstatements  advancing  the  ideals  of  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion”).    These  allegations \ndemonstrate Plaintiff’s longstanding commitment to considering irrelevant racial- and sex-based \ncriteria in hiring decisions, and its assertions in the Complaint show that it has no apparent \nintention of backing away from these practices. \nThe Government has every right to use its procurement power to discourage such practices.  \nDiversity initiatives have always been legally suspect, see Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 594 \n(2009) (Scalia, J., concurring) (“Would a private employer not be guilty of unlawful discrimination \nif he refrained from establishing a racial hiring quota but intentionally designed his hiring practices \nto achieve the same end?  Surely he would.”), and especially so since the Supreme Court’s decision \nin Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 \n(2023) (“SFFA”).  The practices engaged in by Plaintiff and other large law firms provide ample \nbasis for review by the EEOC Commissioner.  By the same token, those practices also justify the \nlesser action of simply reviewing contracting decisions involving Plaintiff.  This Court should \ndismiss Count II as it relates to Section 1 of the Executive Order. \nCount III fares no better.  There, Plaintiff argues that the Executive Order is void for \nvagueness, but identifies only Section 1 as containing the offending language.  In particular, \nPlaintiff  singles  out  Section  1’s  references  to  “diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion”  and  “other \ncategories prohibited by civil rights laws” as unconstitutionally vague.  Compl. ¶ 109.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 14 of 34\nThere is no merit to Plaintiff’s void-for-vagueness challenge.  As an initial matter, it is \ntelling that Plaintiff cites only criminal cases to support its claim.  Here, of course, the Executive \nOrder is not a criminal statute (indeed, not a statute at all) and is not proscriptive like a criminal \nstatute; accordingly, it is unclear that vagueness doctrine even applies.  The D.C. Circuit expressed \ndoubt that the doctrine should be applied to laws other than “those that define criminal offenses” \nand “those that fix the permissible sentences for criminal offenses.”  Kincaid, 854 F.3d at 729 \n(Kavanaugh, J.).  The Executive Order does neither.  \nRegardless, the “degree of vagueness that the Constitution allows depends in part on the \nnature of the enactment.”  Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498-\n99 (1982).  Thus, it is a low bar for civil statutes to satisfy due process.  Seniors Civil Liberties \nAss’n v. Kemp, 965 F.2d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir. 1992) (“To find a civil statute void for vagueness, \nthe statute must be so vague and indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all.”); see also \nGriffin v. Bryant, 30 F. Supp. 3d 1139, 1174 (D.N.M. 2014) (explaining that negligence law “would \n. . . fail the void-for-vagueness analysis that applies to criminal statutes”).  Even more so when all \nthat is at stake are government contracts.  Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, \n589  (1998)  (“[W]hen  the  Government  is  acting  as  patron  rather  than  as  sovereign,  the \nconsequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe.”).     \nAnd here, Plaintiff has no plausible argument that the Executive Order is unconstitutionally \nvague.  The Executive Order, after all, refers to “categories prohibited by civil rights laws.”  EO \n14230 § 1.  Plaintiff alleges that this reference is “unconstitutionally vague,” Compl. ¶ 109, but it \nis no vaguer than the civil rights laws themselves.  See also DOJ Press Release, EEOC and Justice \nDepartment Warn Against Unlawful DEI-Related Discrimination (Mar. 19, 2025) (available at \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/eeoc-and-justice-department-warn-against-unlawful-dei-related-\ndiscrimination) (noting that the “widespread adoption of DEI . . . does not change longstanding \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 15 of 34\nlegal prohibitions against the use of race, sex, and other protected characteristics in employment”).  \nIn other words, to find in Plaintiff’s favor that the Executive Order is unconstitutional on vagueness \ngrounds would also call into question the constitutionality of the civil rights laws.   \nThe Court should decline to reach such an extraordinary conclusion.  So long as it provides \nan “intelligible benchmark,” a civil statute is not void for vagueness.  See K-S Pharms., Inc. v. Am. \nHome Prods. Corp., 962 F.2d 728, 732 (7th Cir. 1992) (Easterbrook, J.).  The Executive Order \neasily meets that standard, to the extent the standard even applies.  The Court should dismiss Count \nIII.  \nAt the end of the day, Plaintiff simply does not like what the current Administration thinks \nabout Plaintiff.  That is not the stuff plausible claims are made of.  “A government entity has the \nright to speak for itself”; it is “entitled to say what it wishes,” and “to select the views that it wants \nto express.”  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 467–68 (2009).  That is all that Section \n1 of the Executive Order does, and Plaintiff has no right to silence the Government’s own opinions.  \nPlaintiff’s claims asking this Court to do just that should be dismissed. \nII.  Plaintiff’s claims fail as to Section 2 of the Executive Order. \nSection 2 of the Executive Order directs relevant agency heads to “take steps consistent \nwith applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, \npending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.”  EO 14230 \n§ 2(a).1  Plaintiff appears to challenge this aspect of the Executive Order on ultra vires grounds \nand as violating due process and the First Amendment.  See Compl. ¶¶ 106–16, 126–35. \n \n1 Also, Section 2(b) of the Executive Order requires, “to the extent permitted by law,” the cessation \nof  the provision of material and services,  “including Sensitive Compartmented Information \nFacilities, provided for the benefit of Perkins Coie.”  The Complaint does not appear to pursue any \nclaim related to this provision.  See Complaint ¶ 52. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 16 of 34\nPlaintiff’s challenges to Section 2 of the Executive Order fail.  To begin, the challenges run \nheadlong into governing D.C. Circuit precedent reflected in Lee v. Garland, 120 F.4th 880 (D.C. \nCir. 2024).  Under that precedent, consistent with Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), courts may not review a decision to deny or revoke a security clearance even when the \ndenial or revocation is challenged on statutory or even constitutional grounds.  Lee, 120 F.4th at \n883; id. at 891 (“The Constitution commits the question whether to deny or revoke a security \nclearance to the Executive Branch.”); id. (“[F]ederal courts generally may not second-guess the \npolitical branches’ discretionary judgments about matters of national security.”).  Importantly, the \nLee court considered the fact that assessment of “constitutional challenges often require courts to \nmake nuanced judgments about the challenged government action:  What was its motivation? . . .  \nDid the government have a compelling, substantial, or legitimate interest for its decision?  Was its \nreasoning adequately tailored to that interest?”  Id. at 893–94.  The Court concluded, however, that \n“[i]n the context of clearance decisions, a court could not answer such questions without doing \nwhat Egan said is not reasonably possible.”  Id. at 894. \nConsistent with this precedent and reasoning, to the extent Plaintiff in this case challenges \nthe  suspension  of  security  clearances  pending  further  review,  such  claims,  even  when \nconstitutionally based, are not judicially reviewable and must fail.   \nThe same should be true with respect to the Executive Order’s call for that further review.  \n“[E]ntities  charged  with  making  security  clearance  decisions  . . .  need  full  access  to  even \nunsubstantiated and doubtful information in order to make the sensitive, predictive judgments that \nEgan protects.”  Rattigan v. Holder, 689 F.3d 764, 769 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Accordingly, even \nproviding false information for purposes of making security clearance decisions is generally not \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 17 of 34\nactionable so long as that information was not knowingly false.  Id.  And here, the review called \nfor by the President easily surpasses that low standard.   \nThe entire Steele dossier debacle involved multiple falsehoods related to the matter as laid \nout in the report by the Special Counsel John Durham.  Special Counsel, Report On Matters \nRelated  To  Intelligence Activities And  Investigations Arising  Out  Of  The  2016  Presidential \nCampaigns  (May  12,  2023,  “Durham  Report”)  at  233  &  ff.  (available  at \nhttps://www.justice.gov/archives/media/1381211/dl).   The  Durham  Report  references  Perkins \nCoie over forty times and details its role—acting as counsel to the Clinton campaign and procuring \nand distributing the now-debunked “Steele Dossier.”  Durham Report p. 11–12.  As that report \nindicates, the review contemplated by Section 2 of the Executive Order is based on undisputed \nfact—not falsehood, and certainly not knowing falsehood.  Evaluation of the decision to call for \nreview lies outside of the judicial ken. \nFurthermore, Plaintiff’s procedural due process challenge to Section 2 must also fail.  The \nExecutive Order provides that the suspension of any security clearances is to be done through \n“steps consistent with applicable law . . . pending a review whether such clearances are consistent \nwith the national interest.”  Executive Order 14230 § 2(a).  Another executive order, Executive \nOrder 12968, 60 Fed. Reg. 40245 (1995), “establishes a uniform Federal personnel security \nprogram” for individuals “considered for initial or continued access to classified information.”  \nSection  5.2(a)  of  that  executive  order  provides  extensive  procedural  process  guarantees  to \nindividual clearance holders whose access to classified information is terminated, including notice, \nan opportunity to submit information, and appeal, subject to national security considerations.2  The \n \n2 For example, Section 5.2(e) provides:  “This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the \nresponsibility and power of an agency head pursuant to any law or other Executive order to deny \nor terminate access to classified information in the interests of national security.  The power and \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 18 of 34\nexecutive order also directs agencies to promulgate regulations consistent with these process \nrequirements.  EO 12968 § 5.2(c).  Many agencies have such regulations or directives.  See, e.g., \nDepartment of Defense Manual 5200.02 (Procedures For The DoD Personnel Security Program \n(PSP))  (available  at \nhttps://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/520002m.pdf);  see  id. \n§ 9.2.d (providing that “[n]o final unfavorable national security eligibility determination may be \ntaken” without process provided by the Manual).   \nAccordingly, any individual employee of Plaintiff with a security clearance will receive \nappropriate process, pre- or post-deprivation, with regard to maintaining or restoring their security \nclearance,  and  such  process  in  the  circumstances  of  security  clearance  related  matters  is \npermissible.  Cf. Smith v. District of Columbia, 387 F. Supp. 3d 8, 31 (D.D.C. 2019) (“[I]n \n‘extraordinary  situations  where  some  valid  governmental  interest  is  at  stake  that  justifies \npostponing the hearing until after the’ deprivation, a post-deprivation opportunity to be heard \nsuffices.”) (quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 378–79 (1971)).  Relatedly, any claim \nassociated with the security clearance process that, under governing precedent, may be reviewable, \nis, at this point, not ripe.  See In re Al-Nashiri, 47 F.4th 820, 826 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (“The ripeness \ndoctrine requires that the federal courts reserve judicial power for resolution of concrete and fully \ncrystalized disputes.”).  Until any clearance suspension is accomplished consistent with applicable \nlaw,  and  then  reviewed  consistent  with  applicable  law  and  a  further  security  clearance \ndetermination made, any dispute is premature for judicial consideration. \n \nresponsibility to deny or terminate access to classified information  pursuant to any law or other \nExecutive order may be exercised only where the agency head determines that the procedures \nprescribed in subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a manner that is consistent with \nnational security.  This determination shall be conclusive.” \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 19 of 34\n  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s challenge to Section 2 of the Executive Order must fail. \nIII.  Plaintiff’s claims fail as to Section 3 of the Executive Order. \nSection 3 of the Executive Order concerns the Federal Government’s contracting policies.  \nAs  relevant,  Section  3  issues  two  directives.    First,  “to  the  extent  permissible  by  law,” \n“Government contractors” shall be “require[d] . . . to disclose any business they do with Perkins \nCoie and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract.”  EO 14230 \n§ 3(a).  Second, “the heads of agencies shall . . . take appropriate steps to terminate any contract \n. . . for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service.”  Id. § 3(b)(i).   \nAs a preliminary point, it must be emphasized that when implementing Section 3 the \ngovernment is acting as a private party, not as a sovereign.  Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 675 \n(1994) (plurality opinion) (“The government's interest in achieving its goals as effectively and \nefficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign \nto a significant one when it acts as employer.”).  The effort to combat racial discrimination through \nthe procurement power has been a feature of executive orders since at least the 1940s.  Contractors \nAss’n of Eastern Pa. v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F.2d 159, 168–71 (3d Cir. 1971).  Such orders \nenjoy  the  firmest  possible  constitutional  support.    Id.  at  170  (“In  the  area  of  Government \nprocurement Executive authority to impose non-discrimination contract provisions falls in Justice \nJackson’s first category [from Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), \ndiscussing varying levels of deference to Executive authority]: action pursuant to the express or \nimplied authorization of Congress.”).  Furthermore, while Section 3 relies equally on Plaintiff’s \nracial discrimination and its malfeasance in election litigation for its authority, either ground is \nsufficient to sustain its provisions.  McGowan v. State of Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961) (a \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 20 of 34\nstatute with discriminatory provisions “will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be \nconceived to justify it”). \nIn protest of Section 3, Plaintiff levies Counts I (ultra vires), II (procedural due process), \nIV (equal protection), V (viewpoint discrimination), VI (compelled speech), VII (First Amendment \nretaliation), VIII (right to counsel), and IX (due process right to counsel).  The Court should \ndismiss each one.   \nFirst, Defendants are clearly authorized to manage their contracts.  “Ultra vires review is \nan extraordinary cause of action that has repeatedly been described as extremely limited in scope.”  \nLewis v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 743 F. Supp. 3d 181, 193 (D.D.C. 2024).  Plaintiff must show that \nDefendants “plainly act[ed] in excess of [their] delegated powers” in a way “so extreme that one \nmay view [the error] as jurisdictional or nearly so.”  Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 \nF.4th 716, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  But Defendants are plainly authorized to enter into, manage, and \nterminate  contracts.   And  Federal  regulations  provide  that  such  contracts  include  a  clause \npermitting the Government exceptionally wide latitude to “terminate performance of work” where \n“termination is in the Government’s interest.”  48 C.F.R. § 52.249-2(a).  Plaintiff might dislike \nhow Defendants would exercise that authority under the Executive Order, but that does not make \nDefendants’ actions ultra vires.   \n  Second, this Court should reject Plaintiff’s equal protection claim.  To begin, the class-of-\none theory of equal protection is inapplicable in the government employment context.  Enquist v. \nOr. Dep’t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 609 (2008); see also Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685 (treating \ngovernment contractors and government employees similarly).  And for good reason.  “[R]atifying \na class-of-one theory of equal protection in the context of public employment would impermissibly \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 21 of 34\nconstitutionalize the employee grievance,” Engquist, 553 U.S. at 609—or, in this case, the contract \nbidding and termination process.   \nIn all events, to “properly plead” a class-of-one claim “a plaintiff must demonstrate they \nhave been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no \nrational basis for the difference in treatment.”  Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of Am. v. CFPB, \n907 F. Supp. 2d 112, 126 (D.D.C. 2012).  Neither condition is met here.  Plaintiff is not “similarly \nsituated” to other potential government contractors who do not engage in unlawful DEI practices.  \nAnd the distinction the Executive Order makes—between potential contractors who “engage in \nblatant race-based and sex-based discrimination” and those who do not—is plainly rational.   \nThird, Plaintiff’s procedural due process claim is meritless.  For one, Plaintiff has not \ndemonstrated standing to challenge Section 3 insofar as it regulates its clients.  “[N]o principle is \nmore fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional \nlimitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013) (quoting DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 341 \n(2006)).  “[T]he law of Art[icle] III standing is built” on fundamental separation-of-powers \nprinciples, Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820 (1997) (citation omitted), and “serves to prevent the \njudicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches,” Clapper, 568 U.S. \nat 408.  Accordingly, application of Article III standing requirements must be “especially rigorous \nwhen,” as here, “reaching the merits of the dispute would force [a court] to decide whether an \naction taken by [another] branch[] of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.”  Raines, 521 \nU.S. at 819–20. \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact”—an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest which is “concrete and particularized,” “actual or imminent” and not \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 22 of 34\n“conjectural” or “hypothetical.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  There \nmust be a “causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of” such that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the defendant; and it must be “likely,” and not merely “speculative,” \nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision from the court.  Id.  As the party invoking \nFederal court jurisdiction, Plaintiff “bears the burden of establishing these elements.”  Id. at 555.  \nFurther,  “[P]laintiff  must  demonstrate  standing  for  each  claim  . . .  [it]  seeks  to  press,” \nDaimlerChrysler Corp., 547 U.S. at 335.  And because Plaintiff seeks prospective equitable relief, \nthe “threatened injury must be certainly impending” and not merely “possible.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. \nat 409 (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990)); see City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, \n461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983) (holding prospective relief unavailable based on mere speculation of \nfuture injury).  Such proof of an imminent and non-conjectural injury serves to ensure that legal \nquestions “will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete \nfactual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.”  Valley \nForge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 \n(1982). \nPlaintiff complains that its clients are withdrawing or considering withdrawing work in \nlight of the Executive Order, Compl. ¶¶ 70–76, but such injuries face a significant traceability \nissue.  See Doe v. Apple Inc., 96 F.4th 403, 409 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (traceability requires a “causal \nconnection between the assertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury”).  Section 3 only \n“terminate[s] any contract . . . for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any service.”  EO \n14230 § 3(b)(i).  Plaintiff, for its part, never alleges in the complaint that it was “hired to perform \nany service” under any government contract, nor does it allege a direct nexus between the \ntermination of a client relationship and the cancellation of any specific contract.  There is thus a \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 23 of 34\nsignificant factual predicate missing from the Complaint that connects the Executive Order to any \ninjury this Court can remedy.  See Apple, Inc., 96 F.4th at 409 (no standing when the “chain of \ncausation” “result[s] from the independent action of some third party not before the court”).   \nPlaintiff also argues that it was deprived of adequate process to protect its property interest \non the theory that it was deprived of the “right to be considered for government contracts in \ncommon with all other persons.”  Doe v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 753 F.2d 1092, 1108–09 (D.C. Cir. \n1985).    Here,  too,  Plaintiff  runs  into  a  standing  problem.    Plaintiff  never  alleges  that  the \ngovernment is currently contracting for Plaintiff’s services, or that Plaintiff ever intends to bid for \nany government contract.  With only speculative injury, Plaintiff cannot ask relief of this Court.  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) (“To establish Article III standing, an \ninjury must be concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent.”).  But, even on the merits, this \nclaim is just Plaintiff’s equal protection argument dressed in different garb, and this Court should \ndismiss it.  Plaintiff does have the “right to be considered for government contracts in common \nwith all other persons.”  Id.  And, as the Executive Order indicates, no person who “engage[s] in \nblatant race-based and sex-based discrimination” should be granted a government contract.  EO \n14230 § 1.  \nFourth, Plaintiff raises a variety of First Amendment challenges.  As before, Plaintiff lacks \nstanding to press these claims, because it cannot trace any injury to the Executive Order itself.  \nRegardless, Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim that the Executive Order’s requirement \nthat government contractors “disclose any business they do with Perkins Coie and whether that \nbusiness is related to the subject of the Government contract” is unconstitutional.  EO 14230 § 3(a).  \nFor one, when business conducted with Perkins Coie is “related to the subject of the Government \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 24 of 34\ncontract,” it is very likely that Perkins Coie is a government subcontractor, whose work Defendants \nare entitled to monitor.   \nFor another, a regulation that compels disclosure satisfies the First Amendment so long as \nthere is a “substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important \ngovernment interest.”  Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 607 (2021).  Here, the \ndisclosure requirement is not of the type that compelled-speech doctrine is designed to prevent.  \nPlaintiff’s clients are not required to adopt any viewpoint; all they are asked to do is to make a \nfactual disclosure, and even then only to the government and not to the public as a whole.  Am. \nMeat Inst. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 760 F.3d 18, 27 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (en banc) (disclosure \nrequirement  subject  to  relaxed  scrutiny  when  only  “purely  factual  and  uncontroversial” \ninformation had to be disclosed).   \nAs for Plaintiff’s claims of First Amendment retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, both \nfail.  A contractor pressing these claims must “show (1) that she spoke as a citizen on a matter of \npublic concern and (2) that the termination of her contract was motivated by her speech on a matter \nof public concern.”  Navab-Safavi v. Broad. Bd., 650 F. Supp. 3d 40, 54 (D.D.C. 2009).  Even then, \nthe Government acts within its rights when its “legitimate interests as a contractor, deferentially \nviewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake.”  Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685.   \nThe speech in this case consists of employment practices involving racial discrimination \nand practices that interfere with free and fair elections.  EO 14230 § 3(a).  The fact that these \nactions are punishable under civil rights laws and formed the basis of an investigation Special \nCounsel John Durham amply demonstrates that such speech is not “protected” in any meaningful \nsense.  See Doe v. District of Columbia, 796 F.3d 96, 106 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“To establish a claim \nfor retaliation under the First Amendment, an individual must prove . . . that he engaged in \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 25 of 34\nprotected conduct.” (emphasis added)).  Plaintiff does not dispute that its partners were involved \nwith the dissemination of the debunked Steele Dossier and that its lawyers were sanctioned for its \nconduct in litigation.  Compl. ¶¶ 8, 44.   \nRegardless, Defendants’ “legitimate interests as a contractor . . . outweigh the free speech \ninterests at stake” here.  Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685.  “Efficiency and fiscal responsibility are \npowerful governmental interests.”  Messman v. Helmke, 133 F.3d 1042, 1047 (7th Cir. 1998).  “The \ngovernment needs to be free to terminate both employees and contractors for poor performance, \nto improve the efficiency, efficacy, and responsiveness of service to the public, and to prevent the \nappearance of corruption.”  Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 674.3  Those are exactly the rationales the \nExecutive Order provides in Section 3.  It is reasonable to consider a contractor’s performance \nsubpar when they retain the services of a law firm that has proudly engaged (and appears to \ncontinue to engage) in racial discrimination.  It is inefficient for Federal funds to ultimately flow \ninto the coffers of such entities.  And it serves taxpayers to ensure that their dollars are not in any \nway traceable to the subsidization of “racial discrimination, falsified documents designed to \nweaponize the Government against candidates for office, and anti-democratic election changes \nthat invite fraud and distrust.”  EO 14230 § 3.   \nFurthermore,  the  fact  that  a  funding  program  supports  one  point  of  view  does  not \nnecessarily establish viewpoint discrimination against disfavored alternatives.  Rust v. Sullivan, \n500 U.S. 173 (1991).  There are no constitutional concerns with programs that encourage certain \nactivities without providing funds for alternative options on the same issue.  There are only so \n \n3  Moreover,  Umbehr’s  retaliation  analysis  is  limited  to  current  government  employees  or \ncontractors.  The Court specifically noted that its decision did “not address the possibility of suits \nby  bidders  or  applicants  for  new  government  contracts  who  cannot  rely  on  [pre-existing] \nrelationship[s].”  Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 26 of 34\nmany Government contracts to go around; “the Government has not discriminated on the basis of \nviewpoint” merely by “fund[ing] one activity to the exclusion of the other.”  Id. at 193.  By the \nsame token, a “refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the \nimposition of a ‘penalty’ on that activity.”  448 U.S. 297, 317, n.19 (1980).  Try as it might, Plaintiff \ncannot transmogrify the denial of a contract into a sanction that only the judicial branch can enter.  \nChoosing  who  to  contract  with  is  not  “viewpoint  discrimination”  or  “punishment”  in  any \nmeaningful sense of those words; it is merely a fact of life.  If Plaintiff dislikes the Government’s \nchoices in this regard, the solution is that “a government entity is ultimately accountable to the \nelectorate and the political process for its advocacy.”  Pleasant Grove City, 555 U.S. at 469.  It is \nnot to ask this Court for a remedy that it cannot give.   \nAnd fifth, this Court should reject Plaintiff’s claims based on the right to counsel, because \nPlaintiff simply lacks standing to press them.  Plaintiff suggests that the Sixth Amendment is \nimplicated because the Executive Order requires government contractors to disclose their business \nwith Perkins Coie.  But—again—the Executive Order only directs the termination of contracts \nunder  which  Perkins  Coie  provides  services.    Plaintiff  never  explains  how  the  disclosure \nrequirement would itself make it impossible to represent its clients in criminal or civil proceedings.    \nAnd, unsurprisingly, the Complaint provides no examples.  The closest Plaintiff gets is \nwhen it alleges that one of its clients “is now considering retention of an alternative firm to \nrepresent it in connection with a DOJ investigation.”  Compl. ¶ 76.  But that vignette proves the \npoint.  Unless that DOJ investigation somehow implicates a government contract (which the \nComplaint does not allege), Section 3 has nothing to say about the matter.  And in any event, \nadministrative investigations—even ones that “might one day ripen into criminal charges”—\n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 27 of 34\nfrequently do not “implicate the right to counsel.”  Collins v. CFTC, 737 F. Supp. 1467, 1482 (N.D. \nIll. 1990).  The right to counsel simply does not enter the picture as to Section 3.    \nIV.  Plaintiff’s claims fail as to Section 4 of the Executive Order. \nSection 4 of the Executive Order directs the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission to “review the practices of representative large, influential, or industry leading law \nfirms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.], \nincluding whether large law firms: reserve certain positions, such as summer associate spots, for \nindividuals of preferred races; promote individuals on a discriminatory basis; permit client access \non a discriminatory basis; or provide access to events, trainings, or travel on a discriminatory \nbasis.”  EO 14230 § 4(a).  It also directs the Attorney General, “in coordination with the Chair of \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in consultation with State Attorneys General \nas appropriate,” to investigate such matters with respect to such firms that do business with Federal \nentities.  Id. § 4(b).  \nPlaintiff appears to challenge Section 4 on two grounds.  First, in Count III of the \nComplaint, Plaintiff claims Section 4 is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process because \nthe section does not clearly define “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies that may be subject \nto investigation by the EEOC.  See Compl. ¶¶ 109–10.  As already explained, the language Plaintiff \ncomplains of as being overly vague is no less clear than the civil rights laws themselves.  For those \nand other reasons described above, this Court should reject Plaintiff’s attacks on Section 4 under \nCount III.  Second, in Count VII, Plaintiff complains that Section 4 violates the First Amendment \nbecause it constitutes “viewpoint discrimination” and retaliation against Plaintiff for its support of \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion policies.  See id. ¶¶ 145–46, 151–55. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 28 of 34\nTo repeat, Section 4 merely directs the “review” and “investigat[ion]” of “the practices of \nrepresentative large, influential, or industry leading law firms” for consistency with the civil rights \nlaws.  EO 14230 § 4.  That is already what the EEOC is supposed to be doing.  The EEOC is \nalready “empowered . . . to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful employment \npractice” under the civil rights laws.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(a).  The EEOC is already required to \nmake “report[s] . . . to the President . . . on the cause of and means of eliminating discrimination,” \nincluding in any industry the President directs the EEOC to review.  Id. § 2000e-4(e).  And \nmembers of the EEOC are already authorized to file charges against “employer[s] . . . engaged in \nan unlawful employment practice.”  Id. § 2000e-5(b).      \nThus, any supposed injury of Plaintiff is not traceable to the Executive Order and there is \nno plausible relief that the Court can give.  In short, Plaintiff’s supposed injury of being subject to \na review for civil rights violations is unredressable.  Even if the President never issued the \nExecutive Order, Plaintiff would still be subject to review by the EEOC and subject to potential \nlegal action from the EEOC—just like any other employer in the country.  The only relief that \nwould “redress” Plaintiff’s injury is not an injunction against the Executive Order, but rather an \ninjunction granting Plaintiff immunity from civil rights laws applicable to all “representative large, \ninfluential, or industry leading law firms.”   \nFor  similar  reasons,  this  Court  should  reject  Plaintiff’s  claim  of  First  Amendment \nretaliation even if it were to reach the merits.  To succeed on a First Amendment retaliation claim, \na plaintiff must allege “(1) he engaged in conduct protected under the First Amendment; (2) the \ndefendant took some retaliatory action sufficient to deter  a person of ordinary  firmness in \nplaintiff’s  position  from  speaking  again;  and  (3) a  causal  link  between  the  exercise  of  a \nconstitutional right and the adverse action taken against him.”  Aref v. Lynch, 833 F.3d 242, 258 \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 29 of 34\n(D.C. Cir. 2016).  “To satisfy the causation link, a plaintiff must allege that his or her constitutional \nspeech was the ‘but for’ cause of the defendants' retaliatory action,” Doe v. D.C., 796 F.3d 96, 107 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015); that is, the plaintiff must allege that the retaliatory action “would not have been \ntaken absent the retaliatory motive,” Houston Community College System v. Wilson, 595 U.S. 468, \n477 (2022). \nEven assuming Plaintiff engaged in protected conduct, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate the \nrequisite causal link.  Even before the Executive Order was issued, this Administration had begun \ntaking steps consistent with the view that certain DEI practices, misapplied, could constitute a \nviolation of Title VII.  See EO 14173 of Jan. 21, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (“Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity”).  EO 14173, issued more than a \nmonth before the challenged Executive Order, directed, among other things, Federal agencies to \ntake appropriate action to “advance in the private sector” merit-based opportunity, EO 14173 \n§ 4(a), and to enforce civil rights laws and combat illegal private-sector DEI policies and practices, \nid. § 2; see also id. § 4(b) (requiring plan for compliance investigations going after illegal \ndiscrimination  in  large,  private  entities);  supra  Part  I  (regarding  EEOC/DOJ  press  release \nconcerning DEI-related guidance).  It should not be surprising, then, that an executive order \nconcerning a large private law firm included a provision like Section 4, directing EEOC “review” \nof practices of “representative large, influential, or industry leading law firms,” as part of the \nAdministration’s broader efforts.  Thus, Plaintiff cannot show that the Section 4 review, the alleged \nretaliatory action, “would not have been taken absent the [alleged] retaliatory motive.”  Plaintiff’s \nretaliation claim cannot succeed. \nAt bottom, the Administration has raised legitimate legal issues of just how far DEI policies \nand programs can go and whether such policies cross the line into illegal discrimination under Title \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 30 of 34\nVII.  The Court should not use its equitable and other powers to excuse Plaintiff from the scope of \na review of multiple law firms on this issue.  Plaintiff may believe its practices are not illegal, but \nit is not entitled to a “free pass” from a legitimate review of multiple law firms’ employment \npractices.   \nV.  Plaintiff’s claims fail as to Section 5 of the Executive Order.     \nFinally, Section 5 of the Executive Order concerns Federal hiring, access to government \nbuildings, and interaction with government employees.  As relevant, Section 5 provides three \ndirectives.  First, agency heads “shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting \nofficial access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Perkins Coie when such access \nwould threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United \nStates.”  EO 14230 § 5(a).  Second, agency heads “shall provide guidance limiting Government \nemployees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Perkins Coie employees to ensure \nconsistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.”  Id.  Third, \n“[a]gency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Perkins \nCoie, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the \nOffice of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United \nStates.”  Id. § 5(b). \nPlaintiff raises a variety of challenges to Section 5.  This Court should reject them as unripe \nwithout even reaching the merits.  “[A] claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent \nfuture events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”  In re Al-Nashiri, \n47 F.4th at 826.  That describes Plaintiff’s claims against Section 5 to a tee.  Section 5 directs \nagency heads to “provide guidance” on “limiting” access to government buildings and interactions \nwith government employees.  It does not outright ban such access.  Plaintiff can only guess the \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 31 of 34\ndegree to which agency heads will limit government access, and indeed Section 5 directs such \nagency heads only to do so “to the extent permitted by law.”  Perhaps agency heads will limit their \nguidance  to  prohibiting  Plaintiff  from  entering  Government  locations  storing  sensitive \ninformation, which no member of the public has a right to access.  Perhaps the agency heads and \nthe OPM director will, as a matter of course, waive the hiring freeze in all cases but the ones posing \nthe most egregious threats to national security.  Either way, Plaintiff cannot bring this challenge on \nnothing more than rank speculation of what agency heads might do in response to Section 5 and \nwithout concrete examples of harm alleged to have been caused by Section 5.     \nThat lack of ripeness infects the entire challenge against Section 5.  Plaintiff alleges that \nthe Executive Order “impairs Perkin Coie’s ability to follow its chosen profession by limiting . . . \nits ability to represent clients in court and before agencies.”  Compl. ¶ 101.  It accuses the order of \n“barring  Perkins  Coie  from  . . .  interacting  with  federal  employees[]  and  accessing  federal \nbuildings.”  Id. ¶ 123.  It cries alarm that the order “conditions . . . access to government facilities” \non “political support or affiliation.”  Id. ¶ 132.  And it lambasts the order for “significantly \nimpair[ing] Perkins Coie’s ability to advance clients’ interests before the government.”  Id. ¶¶ 160–\n61.  But at the end of the day, Plaintiff is challenging a Section of the EO that tells agency heads \nonly to “issue guidance.”  It therefore cannot plausibly allege that Section 5 caused it injury on the \nbasis of guidance which has not been issued.  There is simply no case for this Court to hear on this \nsubject.   \nEven if this Court were to proceed to the merits, it should dismiss Plaintiff’s claims \nchallenge to Section 5.  Start with Plaintiff’s ultra vires claim, which remarkably suggests that \nFederal agencies lack any authority to control over who can enter their buildings or interact with \ntheir employees on official business.  There is no constitutional right to enter government buildings \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 32 of 34\nat will, U.S. Postal Serv. v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Ass’ns, 453 U.S. 114, 129 (1981), and \n“[t]he State, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its \ncontrol for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated,” Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 836 (1976).  \nAs  before,  Plaintiff  might  think  that  Defendants  plan  to  exercise  this  authority  in  an \nunconstitutional manner (though, again, no guidance has yet issued), but that is reason to raise a \nconstitutional claim, not an ultra vires claim.  Cf. Eagle Trust Fund v. USPS, 811 F. App’x 669, \n670 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  \nThose constitutional claims, however, fare no better.  Once again, Plaintiff lacks standing \nto press its due process claims, because it cannot point to any injury traceable to Section 5 of the \nExecutive Order.  Furthermore, whether Plaintiff received adequate process depends on the \n“importance of the private interest at stake,” English, 717 F.3d at 972, and the “interest at stake” \ndepends on what guidance the agency heads will issue.  Until then, Plaintiff’s conclusory assertion \nthat the Executive Order “deprives Perkins Coie of its liberty interest in its First Amendment right \nto petition the government” is due no weight at all.  Compl. ¶ 101.   \nPlaintiff’s equal protection claim fails as well.  According to Plaintiff, there is not “even a \nrational justification for the Order.”  Id. ¶ 123.  But that ignores the actual text of Section 5.  Every \npart of Section 5 is tied to “the national security” of the United States.  EO 14230 § 5.  Agency \nheads are directed to “limit official access” only when “access would threaten the national security \nof or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.”  They are directed to “limit \nGovernment  employees  acting  in  their  official  capacity  from  engaging  with  Perkins  Coie \nemployees” only “to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United \nStates.”  And the hiring freeze may be overridden so long as the agency head and the OPM Director \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 33 of 34\ndetermines “that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States.”  In other \nwords, Section 5 clearly states a rational justification.   \nAnd  Plaintiff’s  First Amendment  claims  falter  for  similar  reasons.   To  state  a  First \nAmendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must allege “a causal link between the exercise of a \nconstitutional right and the adverse action taken against him.”  Aref, 833 F.3d at 258.  Even \nassuming Plaintiff engaged in protected conduct Plaintiff cannot demonstrate the requisite causal \nlink.  Section 5 is not tied to speech; it is tied to the “national security” and the “interests” of the \nUnited States, “to the extent permitted by law.”  EO 14230 § 5.   \nFinally, Plaintiff appears to rest heavily on the notion that Section 5 violates its clients’ \nright to counsel.  Again, until agency heads issue guidance, Plaintiff can only speculate as to \nwhether anyone’s right to counsel will be affected at all by Section 5.  Regardless, “[t]he \nconstitutional right to choice of counsel . . . is not absolute.”  United States v. Friedman, 849 F.2d \n1488, 1490 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  It “must be balanced against the government’s interest in the fair, \norderly, and effective administration of the courts which, in a given case, may require an accused \nto resort to his second choice of counsel.”  United States v. Koblitz, 803 F.2d 1523, 1528 (11th Cir. \n1986).  And the right is “qualified by the need to avoid undermining public confidence in the \nintegrity of the legal system.”  United States v. Wheat, 813 F.2d 1399, 1401–02 (9th Cir. 1987).   \nRead as a whole, the Executive Order considered Plaintiff’s history in litigation—including \na court sanction and involvement with Fusion GPS.  EO 14230 § 1.  And as to Section 5 itself, the \nExecutive Order is preoccupied with the “national security” and “interests” of the United States.  \nId. § 5.  If completely unfettered access to government buildings and government employees in \nfact “threaten[ed] the national security” of the United States, id., turning a blind eye to that threat \nwould surely “undermine public confidence in the integrity of the legal system” (Wheat, 813 F.2d \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 43     Filed 04/02/25     Page 34 of 34\nat 1401–02) and would impair “the fair, orderly, and effective administration of the courts,” \nKoblitz, 803 F.2d at 1528.  And if completely unfettered access would not threaten the national \nsecurity or interests of the United States, then Section 5 will have no impact whatsoever on Plaintiff \nand it would lack any injury to complain of.  Either way, the Court should dismiss this claim as \nwell.   \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should dismiss the Complaint and grant judgment to Defendants.  \nDated: April 2, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \n \n  CHAD MIZELLE  \nActing Associate Attorney General \n \n \n/s/ Richard Lawson       \nRICHARD LAWSON \nDeputy Associate Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20530 \nTelephone: (202) 445-8042 \n \nCounsel for Defendants \n \n \n \n32 \n ",

Howell \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nThough this adage is commonplace, and the tactic overused, it is called to mind by \ndefendants’ pending motion to disqualify this Court: “When you can’t attack the message, attack \nthe messenger.”  Defendants filed this motion less than two weeks after this Court issued a \ntemporary restraining order barring defendants from enforcing against plaintiff Perkins Coie LLP \nthree of the five sections of Executive Order 14230 (“EO 14230”), issued by President Donald J. \nTrump on March 6, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 11781 (Mar. 11, 2025), targeting the law firm with punitive \nmeasures due to the law firm’s representation of clients whom the President dislikes or who sought \nrelief through litigation that the President opposes.  When the U.S. Department of Justice engages \nin this rhetorical strategy of ad hominem attack, the stakes become much larger than only the \nreputation of the targeted federal judge.  This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the \nfederal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the \nsubstantive legal arguments presented.  \nThe opportunity presented by the defendants’ motion, which invokes 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) \nto disqualify this Court, is welcomed to set the record straight, because facts matter.  To begin, this \nCourt agrees wholeheartedly with defendants that “[f]air proceedings free from any suggestion of \nimpartiality are essential to the integrity of our country’s judiciary.”   Defendants’ Mot. to \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 2 of 21\nDisqualify Judge Beryl Howell (“Defs.’ Mot.”) at 1, ECF No. 34.  No judicial ruling exists in a \nvacuum but rests on the facts presented in “Cases” or “Controversies” necessary for the exercise \nof a federal court’s jurisdiction, U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, and every litigating party deserves a fair \nand impartial hearing to determine both what the material facts are and how the law best applies \nto those facts.  That fundamental promise, however, does not entitle any party—not even those \nwith the power and prestige of the President of the United States or a federal agency—to demand \nadherence to their own version of the facts and preferred legal outcome.  “Factfinding,” after all, \n“is the basic responsibility of district courts,” Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 291 (1982) \n(citation omitted, alteration accepted), and “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the \njudicial department to say what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 \n(1803).   \nThis reminder about the role of the federal courts seems necessary given the opening line \nin defendants’ pending motion, expressing “the need to curtail ongoing improper encroachments \nof President Trump’s Executive Power playing out around the country.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 1.  This \nline, which sounds like a talking point from a member of Congress rather than a legal brief from \nthe United States Department of Justice, has no citation to any legal authority for the simple reason \nthat  the  notion  expressed  reflects  a  grave  misapprehension  of  our  constitutional  order.  \nAdjudicating whether an Executive Branch exercise of power is legal, or not, is actually the job of \nthe federal courts, and not of the President or the Department of Justice, though vigorous and \nrigorous defense of executive actions is both expected and helpful to the courts in resolving legal \nissues.  Defendants then proceed, in the second line of their pending motion, to describe as \n“meritless” every lawsuit challenging the President’s “agenda that the American people elected \nhim to carry out.”  Id.  This blanket denigration of the merits of all the lawsuits filed across the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 3 of 21\ncountry certainly reflects palpable frustration with court rulings issued to pause, temper, or reverse \nTrump  Administration  actions,  but  this  is  a  testament  to  the  fact  that  this  country  has  an \nindependent judiciary that adheres to an impartial adjudication process, without being swayed \nmerely because the federal government appears on one side of a case and the President wishes a \nparticular result.  \nWhile obviously not able to speak to the merits of all the cases “around the country” \nprovoking defendants’ frustration, a quick survey of the cases over which this Court is presiding \nchallenging the current Administration’s actions show that, contrary to the defendants’ posturing, \nthe outcomes have followed the facts and the law.  When the facts and applicable law appear likely \nto favor the actions taken by the current administration, for example, this Court has ruled in the \ngovernment’s favor.  See, e.g., Min. Order, U.S. Inst. of Peace v. Jackson, No. 25-cv-804-BAH \n(D.D.C. Mar. 19, 2025) (denying motion for a temporary restraining order filed by plaintiffs in a \ncase against President Trump and ten other Executive Branch defendants for terminating ten board \nmembers and the acting president of the U.S. Institute of Peace).  In another case, even the \ngovernment conceded that binding Supreme Court precedent required the legal result reached by \nthis Court if the facts were found to be sufficiently similar to that precedent, which the Court found \nthey were.  See Wilcox v. Trump, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 720914, at *10 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025); \nid.  at  *1  (“Humphrey’s  Executor  remains  binding  on  this  Court,  as  defendants  rightly \nacknowledge.” (citing Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 n.2)); Defs.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. & Opp’n to Pls.’ \nMot. for Summ. J. at 8 n.2, Wilcox v. Trump, No. 25-cv-334, ECF No. 23 (D.D.C.) (filed Feb. 21, \n2025) (“[T]he government acknowledges that whatever little remains of Humphrey’s Executor is \nbinding on this Court until overturned by the Supreme Court.”).  Thus, in the latter case, the action \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 4 of 21\ntaken by the President was declared null and void, since the facts and applicable law entitled the \nplaintiff to a favorable judgment.  The neutral administration of justice required no less.   \nThe D.C. Circuit has warned that consideration of a motion for disqualification “is never \ntaken lightly,” since “[i]n the wrong hands, a disqualification motion is a procedural weapon” that, \n“[i]f supported only by rumor, speculation, or innuendo,” might be used, among other nefarious \npurposes, as “a means to tarnish the reputation of a federal judge,” United States v. Microsoft \nCorp., 253 F.3d 34, 108 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (en banc) (per curiam), or to “reduce[] the judicial process \nto little more than a skirmish in a partisan battle,” In re Flynn, 973 F.3d 74, 85 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(en banc) (per curiam) (Griffith, J., concurring).  This larger concern about the overall damage to \nthe rule of law and the federal judicial system from the feckless impugning of the decision-making \nprocess of individual federal judges has prompted Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., to criticize \n“regrettabl[e] . . . attempts” by “[p]ublic officials . . . to intimidate judges,” including by \n“suggesting  political  bias  in  the  judge’s  adverse  rulings  without  a  credible  basis  for  such \nallegations.”  John G. Roberts, Jr., 2024 Year End Rep. on the Fed. Judiciary 7 (Dec. 31, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/QU5A-r9YB.      \nHere, defendants rely only on “speculation[ and] innuendo” in seeking to get another Judge \nassigned to preside over this case.  The clear absence of any legitimate basis for disqualification \nrequires denial of the pending motion.  See, e.g., United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31, 139 \nn.360 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (“[I]n assessing the reasonableness of a challenge to his impartiality, each \njudge must be alert to avoid the possibility that those who would question his impartiality are in \nfact seeking to avoid the consequences of his expected adverse decision. . . . Nothing in [§455] \nshould be read to warrant the transformation of a litigant’s fear that a judge may decide a question \nagainst him into a ‘reasonable fear’ that the judge will not be impartial.”); Garrett v. Ohio State \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 21\nUniv., 60 F.4th 359, 371 (6th Cir. 2023) (warning of the “significant toll” “exact[ed]” on the \njudiciary by “needless recusals,” including “facilitat[ing] judge-shopping” (quoting In re U.S., 572 \nF.3d 301, 308 (7th Cir. 2009))). \nI.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA judge must “disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might \nreasonably be questioned,” 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), or “[w]here he has a personal bias or prejudice \nconcerning a party,” id. § (b)(1).  This statute sets a high bar under which “recusal must be limited \nto truly extraordinary cases.”  Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 317, 332 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see also, \ne.g., United States v. Pollard, 959 F.2d 1011, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“[D]isqualification of a judge \nis not lightly granted,” since “that relief” is “extraordinary.”).  As a result, the party moving for \ndisqualification carries a “heavy burden” of proof to succeed.  Cobell, 455 F.3d at 332.  A court’s \n“judicial rulings alone almost never” satisfy this standard.  Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, \n555 (1994) (citing United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583 (1966)); see also SEC v. \nLoving Spirit Found. Inc., 392 F.3d 486, 493 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“[R]ulings resting on record \nevidence ‘almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.’” (quoting Liteky, \n510 U.S. at 555)).  Instead, as the Supreme Court has explained, adverse rulings are “[a]lmost \ninvariably . . . proper grounds for appeal, not for recusal.”  Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555.  Moreover, \njudicial recusal is required “‘if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would expect \nthat the judge would have actual knowledge’ of his interest or bias in the case.”  Sao Paulo State \nof Federative Republic of Braz. v. Am. Tobacco Co., 535 U.S. 229, 232-33 (2002) (emphasis in \noriginal) (quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 861 (1988)); see also \nMicrosoft Corp. v. United States, 530 U.S. 1301, 1302 (2000) (Statement of Chief Justice \nRehnquist on decision not to recuse) (noting that, under § 455(a), the “inquiry is an objective one, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 6 of 21\nmade from the perspective of a reasonable observer who is informed of all the surrounding facts \nand circumstances”); United States v. Hite, 769 F.3d 1154, 1172 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (reiterating that \nrulings alone are almost never a basis for recusal). \nSimilarly, when a motion for disqualification relies on other grounds, recusal is improper \nunless the moving party can show that the judge has “displayed deep-seated and unequivocal \nantagonism that would render fair judgment impossible.”  Liteky, 510 U.S. at 556; id. at 558 \n(Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in  judgment)  (“[U]nder  [28  U.S.C.]  § 455(a),  a  judge  should  be \ndisqualified only if it appears that he or she harbors an aversion, hostility or disposition of a kind \nthat a fair-minded person could not set aside when judging the dispute.”).  This standard is not \nsatisfied merely because a judge “has expressed an opinion” on a legal issue “while on the bench,” \nsomething the Supreme Court has long recognized is “common,” and, in fact, “encourage[d],” by \nvarious codes governing judicial conduct.  Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 779 \n(2002). \nII.  DISCUSSION \nDefendants base their disqualification motion on the claim that this Court has demonstrated \n“[s]ystematic” “disdain for President Trump,” Defs.’ Mot. at 3, in three referenced prior rulings, \nsee id. at 1, 4-5, and in “comments in this proceeding, other judicial proceedings, and in the \npublic,” id. at 6.1  Although defendants’ motion is rife with innuendo, none of the claims put \nforward come close to meeting the standard for disqualification.   \n \n1   Defendants’ requested relief is not just to have this case reassigned but, more specifically, “transferred to \nanother district court judge who was neither involved with [the] Mueller Report nor the investigation of Special \nCounsel John Durham (“Durham Investigation”) and who has not demonstrated a pattern of hostility towards \nDefendants.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 2; see also id. at 7 (asking for reassignment “before a judge free from any appearance \nof hostility toward this Administration and is otherwise unconnected with any matter related to the Mueller Report \nor Durham Investigation”).  Though this odd request might leave available for any reassignment those judges who \nhandled matters related to investigations by Special Counsels Jack Smith and Robert Hur, by defendants’ measure of \npurported bias, recusal would apply to most of the judges on this Court.  Other judges have overseen grand jury \nmatters involving the President, tried cases brought by the Mueller and Durham Special Counsel Offices, granted \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 7 of 21\nA.  Defendants’ Reliance On This Court’s Three Prior Rulings  \nDespite the law being clear that prior rulings “[a]lmost invariably” do not provide a basis \nfor disqualification, Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555, defendants point to three prior decisions of this Court \nas suggesting bias.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 4-5.  Notably, defendants “offer[] no evidence” of actual \nbias but instead “merely infer[] bias from unfavorable judicial rulings.”  Rafferty v. NYNEX Corp., \n60 F.3d 844, 848 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (emphasis in original).  These prior rulings are addressed in \nreverse chronological order.  \n1.  Dismissal of Cases Charging Defendants with Criminal Conduct at the \nU.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 \n Defendants claim that  this Court’s dismissal of pending  charges against defendants \ncharged with criminal conduct at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, showed “hostility toward \nPresident Trump” through “disdain for his supporters,” Defs.’ Mot. at 4 (citing only United States \nv. Jovanovic, No. 25-cr-15 (BAH), 2025 WL 266551, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 2025)).2  These \n \ndismissal without prejudice in January 6 prosecutions, and granted temporary restraining orders against the Trump \nadministration.  The regularity of these judicial decisions only highlights how unfounded the government’s request \nis for recusal.   \n \n2   The Jovanovic decision relied upon by defendants was only one of many issued by this Court to resolve the \ngovernment’s motions to dismiss, with prejudice, ongoing criminal cases against defendants for offense conduct \nduring the January 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.  In a number of these cases, the defendants were charged with \nfelonies for assaulting and/or physically resisting law enforcement officers, which charges were supported by the \ndefendants’ own admissions, photographic and video evidence, and extensive law enforcement investigations.  For \ninstance, in Jovanovic, the government alleged, based on photographic and video evidence, that the defendant \nassaulted law enforcement officers in a “prolonged scuffle” where he “rushed a line of police officers,” and grabbed \nan officer’s baton to drag that officer into a “mob” of rioters.  2025 WL 266551, at *1.  In United States v. DeCarlo, \nNo. 21-cr-73 (BAH), 2025 WL 266308, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 2025), the two defendants, one of whom was a \nformer senior leader of the Proud Boys, “by their own admission, engaged in criminal assault against law \nenforcement officers . . ., as well as property damage and theft” while at the Capitol.  In United States v. Amos, -- F. \nSupp. 3d --, 2025 WL 275639, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 23, 2025), the defendant faced criminal charges for, among other \nconduct, attempting to break past a police line outside the Capitol, charging law enforcement officers while wielding \na flagpole, and assaulting law enforcement officers by deploying pepper spray against them.  In United States v. \nMangia, No. 23-cr-288-2 (BAH), 2025 WL 266493, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 2025), evidence showed, and the co-\ndefendant in the case admitted, that the defendant physically assaulted law enforcement officers, breached the \nCapitol two separate times, and entered the Speaker of the House’s personal office and the Senate floor.  In United \nStates v. Dahlquist, No. 24-cr-443 (BAH), 2025 WL 270608, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 2025), the defendant was \ncharged with nine counts, including the direct assault of two law enforcement officers, based on photographic and \nvideo evidence of defendant spraying officers with a chemical agent and throwing a four-by-four piece of lumber at \nofficers responding to the scene.  In United States v. Gonzalez, No. 24-cr-462 (BAH), 2025 WL 275605, at *1 \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 8 of 21\ndefendants were not identified, investigated, and prosecuted for their political beliefs or support \nfor President Trump but because they engaged in offense conduct during the January 6, 2021, \nattack on the U.S. Capitol that allegedly violated federal criminal laws.  The offense conduct of \nthese dismissed defendants, similarly to the many pardoned defendants, who already had been \nconvicted of offense conduct at the Capitol attack, ran the gamut of breaching police lines, illegally \nentering restricted grounds, and assaulting and impeding police officers.  Their conduct—not their \nbeliefs and not their political views—was the reason for their criminal charges.     \nDefendants further accuse this Court of “grandstand[ing],” id., because the decisions in \neach such dismissed case explained the legal and factual reasons for dismissing the cases “without \nprejudice,” rather than simply granting the request of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of \nColumbia for dismissal “with prejudice,” see, e.g., Jovanovic, 2025 WL 266551, at *2-3.  As a \nmatter of law, the requested dismissals of charges in these cases were predicated on a criminal \nprocedural rule requiring the exercise of judicial discretion, albeit narrow, and thus an explanation \nfor the decision reached, in the form of a written decision, is appropriate and even warranted.  See \nFED. R. CRIM. P. 48(a) (“The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, \ninformation, or complaint.” (emphasis supplied)).  \nThe crux of defendants’ critique appears to be the fact that, in explaining the decision to \ndismiss  the  pending  criminal  cases  without  prejudice,  this  Court  did  not  adopt  in  full  the \nPresident’s reasons for his issuance of the pardons to convicted defendants and his direction to the \nD.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office to seek dismissal of the pending cases arising from the January 6, \n \n(D.D.C. Jan. 23, 2025), the defendant was charged with felonies for directly assaulting two law enforcement officers \nand destroying government property, resulting in damages of more than $1,000.  In United States v. Williams, No. \n21-cr-377 (BAH), 2025 WL 266565, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 2025), the defendant faced charges for, in his own \nwords, “storm[ing] the stairs of the Capitol, push[ing] the cops back, . . . and hit[ting] everybody.” (alterations in \noriginal) (citation, internal quotation marks omitted).  In United States v. Giusini, No. 24-cr-318 (BAH), 2025 WL \n275683, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 23, 2025), the defendant admitted to using physical force to help resist the police line \nattempting to clear and secure the Capitol building. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 9 of 21\n2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.  See Proclamation No. 10887, 90 Fed. Reg. 8331 (Jan. 29, 2025).  \nAs  defendants  highlight,  this  Court,  in  “[d]irectly  rejecting  the  president’s  determination” \njustifying the “dismissal of pending indictments,” instead “curtly stated that no ‘national injustice’ \noccurred here.”  Defs. Mot. at 4 (quoting Jovanovic, 2025 WL 266551, at *2).  In essence, \ndefendants are affronted that the President’s version of the facts was not simply adopted as reality \nby this Court. \nWhatever reasons the President gives for the exercise of his pardon power are unreviewable \nby the courts.  See, e.g., United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128, 147 (1871) (“To the executive alone \nis intrusted the power of pardon; and it is granted without limit.”); The Laura, 114 U.S. 411, 413 \n(1885) (recognizing that the President has “the general, unqualified grant of power to pardon \noffenses against the United States”); United States v. Flynn, 507 F. Supp. 3d 116, 135-37 (D.D.C. \n2020) (collecting and reviewing cases on the scope of the President’s pardon power).  While the \nPresident may want a judicial imprimatur to bolster his reasons for a pardon, no court is required \nto grant this wish, though courts should explain the reasons for any judicial decision.  That is the \nresponsibility this Court fulfilled.  See, e.g., Jovanovic, 2025 WL 266551, at *1-3 (reviewing the \nfactual  allegations  supporting  criminal  charges  against  defendant  and  noting  that  “the \ngovernment’s cursory motion provides no factual basis for dismissal,” acknowledging that “the \ngovernment’s view of the public interest” does not clearly fall within the types of reasons found \nto warrant denial of a government Rule 48(a) motion to dismiss charges, but finding that “[n]othing \nabout the government’s reasoning for dismissal warrants entry of dismissal with prejudice” \n(emphasis in original)).3   \n \n3   Contrary to the reason given by the President for pardoning defendants charged with criminal conduct at \nthe U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021—i.e., asserting that these defendants were the subjects of a “national injustice,” \nProclamation No. 10887, 90 Fed. Reg. 8331 (Jan. 29, 2025)—the same careful review of the facts and law relevant \nto each individual case this Court applied to the government’s dismissal motions was also given to January 6 \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 10 of 21\nMoreover,  the  specific  statements  by  this  Court  in  these  decisions  granting  the \ngovernment’s motion to dismissing pending charges against January 6 defendants that are objected \nto by defendants—i.e., “[n]o ‘national injustice’ occurred here,” id. at *2 (quoting Proclamation \nNo. 10887), and that statements to the contrary represented a “revisionist myth,” id.—provide no \nbasis for finding “recusable . . . bias or prejudice,” since these statements were “properly and \nnecessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings,” Liteky, 510 U.S. at 551, against the specific \ndismissed  defendant  and  “scores”  of  other  January  6  cases,  through  review  of  “extensive \nvideotapes and photographs, admissions by defendants in the course of plea hearings and in \ntestimony at trials, and the testimony of law enforcement officers and congressional staff present \nat the Capitol” on January 6, 2021, Jovanovic, 2025 WL 266551, at *2.  Since these comments \nproperly “reflect[] what [the Court] learned . . . during the proceedings,” Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d \nat 115, they provide no basis for disqualification.  \nDecisions from the D.C. Circuit finding that recusal was not warranted in cases involving \nfar more critical comments made about criminal defendants reinforce this determination, see, e.g., \nHaldeman, 559 F.2d at 131-32, 131 n.293 (holding, in a case involving Watergate defendants, that \nrecusal was not warranted despite comments from a previous case “express[ing] a belief that \ncriminal liability extended beyond the seven persons there charged” and “suggest[ing] persons \nwhom the prosecutors might consider calling before the grand jury investigating ‘Watergate’”); In \nre Flynn, 973 F.3d at 83 (finding no recusal warranted where the district judge told the defendant, \n \ndefendants’ motions filed during the pendency of their cases, resulting in some rulings by this Court favoring the \npositions asserted vigorously by their defense counsel, often over the strenuous objection of the government.

I’m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal \noffense.”), as do similar decisions from other circuits, see, e.g., United States v. Allen, 587 F.3d \n246, 252 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (finding no recusal required for a criminal contempt trial \nwhere the district judge previously stated the defendants were “now in criminal contempt as far as \n[he was] concerned” (alteration in original)); United States v. Young, 45 F.3d 1405, 1414-15 (10th \nCir. 1995) (finding no recusal required where a district judge had previously opined it was \n“obvious” that a defendant was “going to get convicted”).   \n2.   Two Rulings in Grand Jury Related Matters \nDefendants also rely on two decisions issued in grand jury matters, claiming that this Court \n“utilized the judicial power against President Trump himself.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 4 (citing In re \nSealed Case, 77 F.4th 815, 822 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2023)); id. at 5 (citing decision on crime-fraud \nexception to attorney-client privilege as applied to “President Trump’s personal attorney”).4  As \nan initial matter, to the extent that defendants’ characterization of “utiliz[ing] the judicial power” \nmeans deciding cases brought before the Court by determining the facts and applying the relevant \nlegal principles, this phrase merely describes the job of a judge.  For that reason, the Supreme \nCourt’s caution that “judicial rulings alone” are “[a]lmost invariably[] . . . proper grounds for \nappeal, not for recusal,” Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555 (emphasis supplied), bears repeating, particularly \nwhere, as here, appeals were unsuccessfully pursued in both referenced cases, and President Trump \nultimately voluntarily dismissed the appeal in one of those matters.   \nThe first grand jury related decision defendants cite as an example of purported bias \ninvolved enforcement of a search warrant issued to the company formerly known as Twitter.  In \n \n4   Pursuant to D.D.C. Local Civil Rule 40.7, this Court was tasked, during her service as Chief Judge of the \nCourt from March 2016 until March 2023, with resolving legal issues arising from grand jury investigations taking \nplace in this district court, including such investigations conducted generally by the U.S. Department of Justice, the \nD.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office and by special counsels Robert Mueller, John Durham, Jack Smith, and Robert Hur. \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 12 of 21\nre Sealed Case, 77 F.4th at 821.  While the company “ultimately complied with the warrant,” \ncompliance only occurred “three days after a court-ordered deadline,” with which the company \nhad agreed it could and would comply, resulting in a finding of civil contempt and the imposition \nof a previously-noticed sanction for the delay.  Id.; see also Mem. Op., In the Matter of the Search \nof: Information That is Stored at Premises Controlled by Twitter Inc., No. 23-sc-31 (BAH) (D.D.C. \nMar. 3, 2023) [hereinafter Twitter Contempt Decision], Ex. 1 to Notice of Filing of Redacted Mem. \nOp., In the Matter of the Search of: Information That is Stored at Premises Controlled by Twitter \nInc., No. 23-sc-31, ECF No. 32 (D.D.C.) (filed Mar. 3, 2023) (filing a redacted version of the \nCourt’s Mem. Op. as  an attachment to the notice).   On  appeal, this  Court’s decision was \nunanimously “affirm[ed] . . . in all respects” by the D.C. Circuit.  Id.5  To the extent defendants \nallege bias due to the suggestion that a flight risk may have existed were the investigation publicly \nrevealed, they refer only to standard statutory language included in an order and omit that the D.C. \nCircuit specifically found that the “ultimate analysis” in this Court’s decision “did not rely on risk \nof flight.”  Id. at 822 n.2.   \nDefendants also note this Court’s questioning of Twitter’s counsel in a February 7, 2023, \nhearing on Twitter’s failure to comply with the search warrant, Defs.’ Mot. at 5, though how this \nis supposed to show purported bias is not entirely clear.  In context, defendants’ cherry-picked \nquotations were part of close questioning by the Court about the legal justifications put forward \nby Twitter for its highly unusual positions to challenge the search warrant based on theoretical \nclaims of privilege on behalf of a third-party user of the account at issue and the non-disclosure \norder based on First Amendment grounds.  These were challenges Twitter had apparently never \n \n5   Twitter’s petition to the D.C. Circuit for rehearing en banc was denied, No. 23-5044, 2024 WL 158766 \n(D.C. Cir. Jan. 16, 2024), as was the company’s petition to the Supreme Court for certiorari, 145 S. Ct. 159 (2024).  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 13 of 21\nbefore brought in a case involving a covert search warrant, see Twitter Contempt Decision at 1, \nand in testing whether the privilege and First Amendment grounds were merely masking more \nobvious business interests to lure then-former President Trump back to using the Twitter platform, \nthe Court posed pointed questions about this business interest to Twitter’s counsel.  Defendants \nmischaracterize this line of questions as “editorializing,” Defs.’ Mot. at 5, but actually this line of \nquestioning was effective in clarifying the issue since, in response, Twitter’s counsel conceded \nthat the company “had no standing to assert any privilege by any of its users, including the Target \nAccount’s User” and “had no confirmation that the Target Account’s User wanted or would seize \non any opportunity to assert any privilege if such opportunity were provided,” Twitter Contempt \nDecision at 10 (citing Feb. 7, 2023, Hr’g Tr. at 66:3-4, 54:11-25).  \nThe second grand jury related decision cited as an example of purported bias by defendants \ninvolved grand jury subpoenas for testimony from two personal attorneys for President Trump, \n“as part of an investigation into whether the former president orchestrated a scheme unlawfully to \nretain and hide from the government documents bearing classification markings.”  Mem. Op. at 1, \nIn re Grand Jury Subpoena, No. 23-gj-10 (BAH) (D.D.C. Mar. 17, 2023) [hereinafter Crime Fraud \nDecision], Ex. 12 to President Trump’s Mot. to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Prosecutorial \nMisconduct & Due Process Violations (“Trump MTD”), United States v. Trump, No. 9:23-cr-\n80101-AMC, ECF No. 561 (S.D. Fla.) (filed May 21, 2024) (filing the Court’s Mem. Op. as an \nattachment to this motion).  In their strained effort to find some purported bias in this decision, \ndefendants conveniently ignore several notable points.  First, the government’s motion to enforce \nthese subpoenas and compel testimony was granted only in part and denied in part based on an \nextensive review of the facts and applicable legal principles, explained in an 85-page opinion.  See \ngenerally Crime Fraud Decision.  For example, the government’s request to compel the production \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 14 of 21\nof documents from both attorneys was partially denied, id. at 74-79, and the government’s request \nto compel testimony on enumerated topics from one of the attorneys was also partially denied, id. \nat 78-79.  \nSecond, as a grand jury matter, this decision could have remained under seal, literally \nforever, but for the fact that President Trump himself asked for the decision to be unsealed for his \nuse in support of his motion to dismiss the criminal indictment pending against him in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida.  Trump MTD at 20 (citing Crime Fraud Decision at 47 n.13).  Specifically, he \nrelied on a portion of this Court’s Crime Fraud Decision agreeing with his position presented to \nthe Florida court that certain aspects of the prosecutor’s questioning before the grand jury were \nimproper.  Id.  \nFinally, defendants do not take issue here with any of the substantive factual or legal \nfindings in the Crime Fraud Decision, see Defs.’ Mot. at 5, claiming only that the decision suffered \nfrom a “readily apparent lack of venue in this District,” id. at 1.  In fact, President Trump initially \npursued, and lost on appeal, an effort to stay this Court’s decision, Alan Feuer, Ben Protess & \nMaggie Haberman, Appeals Court Orders Trump Lawyer to Hand Over Records in Documents \nInquiry, N.Y. Times (Mar. 22, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/us/politics/trump-\nlawyer-classified-documents-investigation.html, before later voluntarily dismissing his appeal, see \nOrder, In re Sealed Case, No. 23-3035 (D.C. Cir. May 1, 2023); Order, In re Sealed Case, No. 23-\n3036 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 4, 2023).   \nDefendants make a somewhat oblique complaint that this Court, in supervising the grand \njury investigation into then-former President’s retention of documents with classified markings, \nshould have been aware that venue to conduct that investigation in Washington, D.C. was \nsomehow improper, Defs.’ Mot. at 1, 5, when, to the contrary, the documents at issue had been \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 15 of 21\nremoved from this district and were being requested by the National Archives located in this \ndistrict to be returned to this district as records belonging to the American people, not to the former \nPresident personally.  Notably, a venue challenge was never raised in the hotly litigated motion to \ncompel the testimony of the two personal attorneys—not by the attorneys themselves nor by then-\nformer President Trump—for good reasons.  While the grand jury is obtaining and reviewing \nrelevant evidence to assess whether probable cause exists to find that a crime was committed and \nby whom, determining where venue for a criminal charge properly lies may not become clear until \nthe investigation has sufficiently progressed to assess who is involved in the criminal conduct, \nwhere relevant conduct occurred, and the precise charges to be brought.  To be sure, by the time \nthe grand jury returns an indictment, “the government must show that ‘venue is proper with respect \nto each count charged.’”  United States v. Slatten, 865 F.3d 767, 788 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting \nUnited States v. Lam Kwong-Wah, 924 F.2d 298, 301 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).  Here, the Crime Fraud \nDecision was issued several months before any indictment was filed in the Southern District of \nFlorida arising from this aspect of the grand jury’s work. \nIn sum, mere disagreements with the prior legal rulings of this Court do not “constitute a \nvalid basis” for disqualification.  Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555.   \nB.  November 2023 Speech \nDefendants also point to a single line in a speech delivered by this Court in November \n2023,  upon  acceptance  of  an  award  from  the  Women’s  White  Collar  Defense  Association \n(“WWCDA”), Defs.’ Mot. at 3, a non-partisan, non-profit organization that promotes diversity in \nwhite-collar  and  other  defense  and  compliance  legal  work,  see  Membership  and  Mission, \nWomen’s White Collar Defense Ass’n, https://www.wwcda.org/who-we-are/mission-goals-and-\nmembership-criteria (last visited Mar. 25, 2025).  The apolitical, nonpartisan theme of the remarks \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 16 of 21\ndefendants cite for purported bias was the importance of facts in the legal profession, the body \npolitic, and American democracy.  See 2023 WWCDA Awards Gala Full Video (“WWCDA \nVideo”)  at  1:45:11–1:53:15  (Nov.  30,  2023),  YouTube, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDnJWh1gzE.  To support these points, the speech drew on \nexamples from history, including an anecdote about President Abraham Lincoln, see id. at \n1:47:25–1:48:10, and quoted from a recent bestselling book by a Boston College professor of \nAmerican history warning about one of the keys to the rise of authoritarianism being the dismissal \nof facts and reliance on “big lies,” see id. at 1:48:28–1:49:40.  In further emphasis of this point, a \nsingle line of the speech reflected on then-recent experiences at the sentencings of individuals \ninvolved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, stating that judges on this Court \n“regularly see the impact of ‘big lies’ at the sentencing of hundreds, hundreds of individuals who \nhave been convicted for offense conduct on January 6, 2021, when they disrupted the certification \nof the 2020 presidential election at the U.S. Capitol.”  Id. at 1:49:41–1:50:04.  This remark drew \non observations of, and comments made by, defendants and their counsel about the motivations \nfor many defendants to engage in this criminal conduct as stemming from their belief in a stolen \nelection, despite the lack of any evidence showing any outcome dispositive election fraud in the \n2020 presidential election.   \nImportantly, and contrary to defendants’ assertions, see Defs.’ Mot. at 3, this speech never \nmentioned President Trump or took any political positions, nor named any of the media outlets, \npundits or politicians cited by January 6 defendants and their counsel in court proceedings as the \nsource for their mistaken belief in a stolen 2020 presidential election.  See generally WWCDA \nVideo  at  1:45:11–1:53:15.    To  the  extent  defendants  suggest  otherwise  and  even  point  an \naccusatory finger at President Trump as the person who must have been the source, that is their \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 17 of 21\nfinger and not that of this Court.  Their motion twists and mischaracterizes the words actually \nspoken, seemingly adopting the partisan framing by a Republican member of Congress who filed \nthe ethics complaint referenced by defendants against this Court.  Defs.’ Mot. at 3-4; see also April \nRubin, Stefanik Urges Ethics Investigation into Judge Linked to Trump, Jan. 6 Cases, Axios (Dec. \n15,  2023),  https://www.axios.com/2023/12/15/stefanik-complaint-ethics-judge-trump.6    This \nsame Republican member of Congress has filed a series of ethics complaints against other judges \nwho issued rulings perceived to be adverse to President Trump.  See, e.g., Jose Pagliery, New York \nTosses Stefanik’s Trump Court Complaint in Bank Fraud Civil Suit, The Daily Beast (June 3, 2024, \n8:01 PM), https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-tosses-rep-stefaniks-trump-court-complaint-\nin-bank-fraud-civil-suit/ (reporting that an ethics complaint filed by the same Republican member \nof Congress against a New York state court judge overseeing a civil trial against President Trump \nwas dismissed as “having . . . no basis on the facts presented to commence an investigation”); \nSophia Cai, Scoop: Stefanik Files Ethics Complaint Against Judge Merchan, Axios (May 21, \n2024), https://www.axios.com/2024/05/21/stefanik-ethics-complaint-judge-merchan-trump.  Two \nindependent legal ethics experts characterized the ethics complaint filed against this Court as \nfailing to “rais[e] any viable ethics issues.”  Peter A. Joy & Kevin C. McMunigal, Ethics Complaint \nAgainst  Judge  Howell,  Crim.  Just.  Magazine  (Summer  2024), \nhttps://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/resources/magazine/2024-summer/ethics-\ncomplaint-against-judge-howell/.   \n \n6   Other obvious sources for misinformation about a “stolen” 2020 presidential election were certainly \navailable.  Indeed, the ethics complaint from the Republican House member was dated the same day a jury in a civil \nlawsuit presided over by this Court returned a verdict of $148,169,000.00, in compensatory and punitive damages \nfor defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress in favor of two Georgia election workers against \nRudolph W. Giuliani for his false public statements that the plaintiffs had engaged in election fraud when doing their \njob of counting ballots for the 2020 presidential election.  See Verdict Form, Freeman v. Giuliani, No. 21-cv-3354-\nBAH, ECF No. 135 (D.D.C. Dec. 15, 2023). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 18 of 21\nThe  Supreme  Court  has  long  recognized  that  judges  are  “not  only  permit[ted]  but \nencourage[d]” to “state their views on disputed legal issues outside the context of adjudication,” \nincluding “in classes that they conduct, and in books and speeches.”  Republican Party of Minn., \n536 U.S. at 779.  It is “common” for judges to later “confront[] a legal issue on which [they have] \nexpressed an opinion while on the bench,” including “in . . . speeches.”  Id.  This reality does not \nundermine a judge’s impartiality.  In the words of the D.C. Circuit, disqualification “would be \nextraordinary” for remarks that “reflected what [a judge] learned, or what [the judge] thought [s]he \nlearned, during . . . proceedings” in a case.  Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 115.  “[C]andid \nreflections” about a “judge’s assessment of a defendant’s conduct” offered “on the basis of facts \npresented during the proceedings . . . simply do not establish bias or prejudice.”  United States v. \nFokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733, 751 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nIn re Barry, 946 F.2d 913, 914 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). \n“Candid reflections” are exactly what the remarks at issue here offered, drawing on \nknowledge and experience from observing and presiding over many cases and trials arising out of \nthe attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and becoming intimately familiar with the facts of \nthat day.  See, e.g., United States v. Warnagiris, No. 21-cr-382 (PLF), 2025 WL 341990, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Jan. 30, 2025) (explaining the extensive investigations of the facts of January 6 cases and \nvoluminous evidence presented in each case to support the prosecutions).  These cases were used \nto emphasize the importance of a generally applicable legal theme about the critical importance of \naccurate fact-finding to the legal process and to the broader health of our democracy.  As explained \nin the speech, a focus on “authentic, reliable, and tested facts” promotes confidence that all parties \nwill receive fair processes and just outcomes in federal district courts and federal courts more \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 19 of 21\nbroadly.  WWCDA Video at 1:50:04–1:51:05.  Put simply, the nonpartisan discussion of the \nimportance of facts provides no basis for disqualification in this case. \nC.  The Instant Case \nFinally, as is clearly laid out in the “Purpose” section of EO 14230, “issues of the Durham \ninvestigation, the Fusion GPS report, and the Mueller Report are central to the EO.”  Defs.’ Mot. \nat 6; see also EO 14230, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781.  Defendants take issue with what they call the \nCourt’s “concerning and dismissive approach to the entire Durham Investigation” and “[t]he entire \nFusion GPS fiasco.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 6.  While styling this as an accusation about purported bias in \nthe Court’s “[c]onduct,” id., at its core, this objection appears to be that the Court has not given \nsufficient deference to how President Trump views these and other events as “dishonest and \ndangerous activity of the law firm,” EO 14230, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11781, and “actions that \nthreaten our elections, military strength, and national security,” Fact Sheet: President Donald J. \nTrump  Addresses  Risks  from  Perkins  Coie  LLP,  The  White  House  (Mar.  6,  2025), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-adresses-\nrisks-from-perkins-coie-llp/.    While  the  President  and  his  administration  are  promoting  an \nexpansive view of presidential authority and claimed that any decisions purportedly made in the \nname of national security are judicially nonreviewable, see, e.g., Tr. of Mar. 12, 2025, Temporary \nRestraining Order Hr’g (“TRO Hr’g Tr.”) at 30:6–35:12, ECF No. 22; see also id. at 45:23–48:11 \n(defense counsel explaining defendants’ position that “the President has that power, and that it is \nthe right and prerogative of the President as the sole individual vested with Article II authority to \nexercise that prerogative”), that legally debatable claim is at the heart of the challenge in this case, \nsee, e.g., id. at 18:7–21:6 (plaintiff’s counsel articulating position that the President’s conduct \nviolated fundamental constitutional rights and that the use of “the ‘national security’ words are a \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 20 of 21\npretext”); id. at 62:24–64:22 (plaintiff’s counsel further articulating plaintiff’s position that the \nPresident’s actions exceeded his constitutional authority).  The mere fact that the Court, in an \nemergency hearing on a temporary restraining order held less than 24 hours after the filing of the \nmotion, did not immediately adopt defendants’ legal arguments about the level of deference owed \nto the President, even when a national security justification is asserted, does not mean bias exists \nwhen foundational constitutional principles and norms are also at stake.   \nMoreover, defendants’ motion mischaracterizes the discussion of Fusion GPS and the \nMueller investigation.  While noting possible “big differences of view” on these topics, the Court \ntook “at face value” “[t]he President’s perspective” on the issue and used this viewpoint to evaluate \nthe likely legality of EO 14230.  TRO Hr’g Tr. at 32:15–33:16; see also id. at 33:21–43:14 \n(questioning defendants’ counsel about aspects of the legality of the order).  The Court recognized \nthat President Trump is “certainly entitled to his own beliefs, entitled to his preferred causes, and \nhe is entitled to hold tight to his own dislikes.”  Id. at 103:19-21.  As a legal matter, however, the \nCourt found at this stage that “[t]he Constitution protects all [Americans] . . . from the exercise of \n[the  President’s]  targeted  power  based  on  those  dislikes,  to  bring  the  force  of  the  federal \ngovernment down on the lawyers representing his political opponents and challengers to his \npolitical actions, as he has done here.”  Id. at 103:22–104:1.   \nAs this case continues, pursuant to the briefing schedule jointly proposed by the parties, \nJoint Status Report ¶ 3, ECF No. 25, and adopted by the Court, Order, ECF No. 26, the parties will \nhave the opportunity to present relevant evidence and legal arguments, which will receive full, \nfair, and impartial consideration, as does every case before this Court.  To the extent the parties \ndisagree with the final judgment entered, the normal judicial process of appeal applies.  See FED. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00716-BAH     Document 36     Filed 03/26/25     Page 21 of 21\nR. APP. P. 4.  Defendants’ disagreements, no matter how strong, with this Court’s preliminary legal \ndeterminations simply provide no basis for disqualification.  Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555.   \nIII.  CONCLUSION AND ORDER \nFor the reasons addressed above, defendants’ motion to disqualify this Court pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 455, ECF No. 34, which relies only on speculation, innuendo, and basic legal \ndisagreements that provide no basis for disqualification of a judge, must be denied.  Therefore, it \nis hereby— \nORDERED that defendants’ Motion to Disqualify Judge Beryl Howell, ECF No. 34, is \nDENIED. \nSO ORDERED.   \nDate:  March 26, 2025 \n \n__________________________ \nBERYL A.
