          "description": "TEXT ORDER: This Court issued a preliminary injunction on April 15, 2025, ordering that HUD was enjoined \"from freezing, halting, or pausing on a non-individualized basis the processing and payment of funding that (1) was appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and (2) has already been awarded.\" (ECF No. 45 at 61.) And the Court required HUD to \"take immediate steps to resume the processing, disbursement, and payment\" of the same already-awarded funding. Id. The Court and the parties then had to have four status conferences over the course of three subsequent weeks to wrangle the Government into compliance. The Government assured the Court that HUD had \"resumed processing awarded GRRP loans/grants as it would in the ordinary course.\" (ECF No. 51 at 3.) The Nonprofits' Fourth Status Report Regarding Compliance (ECF No. 78) alleges otherwise to the tune of $760 million already-award funds for low-income senior housing still inaccessible. At risk of understatement, that is serious. If no \"Comprehensive\" funding under GRRP has been processed in the nearly four months since the injunction, the Court struggles to see how HUD's inaction can be construed as anything other than a serious violation of the Court's order, one that exhibits blatant disregard for it. That said, the Government is of course entitled to explain itself. The Government shall file a response to the Plaintiffs' Fourth Status Report Regarding Compliance (ECF No. 78) by 12:00pm noon on 8/13/2025. That response should include a sworn declaration from a HUD official explaining why the failure to process GRRP \"Comprehensive\" funding, as described in the Nonprofits' Exhibits 1 and 2, is not a violation of the Court's preliminary injunction and is not contrary to HUD's past representation that it had resumed processing \"as it would in the ordinary course.\" (ECF No. 51 at 3.) The response should also include specific actions that HUD has taken to move forward with resuming processing since April 15, the timeline for full compliance, and why awardees have purportedly seen no progress during these four months. The Court will review the Government's filings and hold a status conference at 4:00pm on 8/13/2025. IT IS SO ORDERED. District Judge Mary S. McElroy on 8/8/2025. (Simoncelli, Michael)"

    "state": "Rhode Island",
    "summary": "<p>On March 13, 2025, four environmental-justice nonprofits including Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council commenced this Administrative Procedure Act (APA) action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The complaint was filed against the United States Departments of Agriculture, Department of Energy, and other federal agencies and their respective leadership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order No. 14154, &ldquo;Unleashing American Energy,&rdquo; and Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-11 (&ldquo;the Memorandum&rdquo;) directed all defendant agencies to &ldquo;immediately pause&rdquo; IRA and IIJA disbursements. According to the complaint, the agencies implemented a non-individualized, government-wide freeze that halted grant payments, closed electronic draw-down portals, and furloughed staff, all without statutory authorization or regulatory compliance, thereby inflicting immediate and irreparable harm on the plaintiffs and the communities they served. Plaintiffs alleged that the administration's actions were arbitrary, capricious, and lack statutory authority, specifically targeting Congress's appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).</p>\r\n<p>Represented by attorneys from DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry &amp; Revens and the Democracy Forward Foundation, the plaintiffs requested that Chief Judge John J. McConnell, Jr., accept the case as related to State of New York v. Trump, which also challenged a large-scale funding freeze. Chief Judge McConnell rejected that designation and ordered random reassignment; the Clerk then reassigned the matter to District Judge Mary S. McElroy.</p>\r\n<p>On March 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint that added Childhood Lead Action Project and Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation as plaintiffs and named the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and its Secretary as additional defendants. The amended pleading expanded the factual narrative and detailed new, plaintiff-specific injuries. It also asserted three APA counts: arbitrary and capricious agency action, agency action in excess of statutory authority, and agency action contrary to the IRA, the IIJA, and governing regulations. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief vacating the freeze and Memorandum M-25-11, an order compelling immediate disbursement of IRA and IIJA funds, and costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2025, Judge McElroy granted a nationwide preliminary injunction. The Court found that the challenged agency actions constituted &ldquo;final agency action&rdquo; reviewable under the APA and that the Tucker Act did not divest the Court of jurisdiction. The Court determined that the plaintiffs demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on their claims that the indefinite freeze was arbitrary and capricious and that the agencies acted beyond the scope of their lawful authority. Finding irreparable harm, the Court enjoined enforcement of the freeze. 778 F.Supp.3d 440.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. appealed on April 30, 2025, and, on May 19, moved &nbsp;to stay further district court proceedings pending appellate review. The district court agreed in part; on May 30, it ordered some limited discovery but otherwise stayed proceedings pending the First Circuit's resolution of the preliminary injunction appeal in New York v. Trump, No. 25-1236 (1st Cir.), a similar case challenging the administration funding freeze. On May 27, 2025, the government asked the First Circuit to hold the appeal in this case in abeyance pending resolution of New York v. Trump. The appellate court denied that motion on June 16, 2025, explaining that the merits panel(s) would coordinate resolution of relevant appeals, as necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the district court held a series of status conferences &ldquo;to wrangle the Government into compliance&rdquo; with the preliminary injunction. &nbsp;On August 8, 2025, the court issued an order responding to the plaintiffs&rsquo; most recent status report, from one day prior, alleging noncompliance by HUD with respect to failure to disburse funds from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). The court ordered the government to file a response including a sworn declaration from a HUD official explaining why the failure to process GRRP funding as described did not violate the injunction and past representations as well as specific actions showing compliance.</p>\r\n<p>On August 13, the Defendants responded to the Plaintiff&rsquo;s fourth status report that the delayed disbursement of funds was not due to non-compliance with the April 15 Order, but rather due to some administrative issues which existed before the Preliminary Injunction was granted and were &ldquo;unrelated to OMB Memorandum M-25-11 and the broader funding freeze&rdquo;. (Defendants&rsquo; response dated August 30, 2025, at 3, Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, 1:25-cv-00097, District of Rhode Island, 2025)</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

McElroy, United States District Judge. \nThis is an administrative law case.  In 2021 and 2022, Congress passed and \nthe President signed two laws—the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the \nInflation  Reduction  Act,  respectively—appropriating  billions  of  dollars  for \ninfrastructure,  agriculture,  energy,  climate,  and  housing  initiatives.    The  laws \nestablished that federal agencies would largely be responsible for administering these \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 3 of 63 PageID #:\n652\n \nfunds.    Since  then,  the  agencies  did  just  that  through  awards  of  grants  and \ncontracts—seemingly without much issue. \nThat swiftly changed in January 2025.  An executive order and a memorandum \nfrom  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  temporarily  forbade  agencies  from \nadministering any more IIJA and IRA money, at least while the agencies reviewed \nspending to ensure its consistency with presidential policy directives.  So the agencies \nstopped providing money to the organizations spearheading these congressionally-\nsupported initiatives, even when those same agencies had already awarded it. \nIt quickly became clear that these actions were part of a much larger effort \nthat extended beyond IIJA and IRA funding—an effort now colloquially known as the \nfederal “funding freeze.”  Next came a whirlwind of litigation.  States and private \norganizations alike have sued a host of agencies to stop different parts of the freeze.  \nSo far, they have largely been successful in obtaining interim relief.  But as the need \nfor this suit shows, that relief has been piecemeal and often limited in scope. \nStill unable to access their funds following other court orders, six nonprofits \nsued several federal agencies and their heads under the Administrative Procedure \nAct (“APA”).  The Nonprofits bring three APA claims against the Government.1  In \n \n1 For ease of reading, the Court uses the term “the Government” to describe the \nDefendants collectively.  The “Agency Defendants” or “Agencies” in turn, refers to \nEnergy, EPA, HUD, Interior, and USDA.  That is not to say, of course, that OMB and \nthe NEC Director are not agencies under the APA; as explained below, quite the \ncontrary.  Instead, the collective term “Agency Defendants” is meant to encompass \nthe group of actors directly charged with administering IIJA and IRA funds.  When \nnecessary, the Court names Defendants with specificity.  Finally, the Court refers to \nthe Plaintiffs collectively as “the Nonprofits.” \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 4 of 63 PageID #:\n653\n \nshort, the Nonprofits argue that the Government—in summarily freezing billions of \ndollars in IIJA and IRA funding—ran afoul of three APA provisions: its requirement \nthat agency actions (1) are not “arbitrary and capricious,” (2) are not “in excess” of \nthe authority that Congress granted the agencies, and (3) are not otherwise contrary \nto law.  The Nonprofits now move for a preliminary injunction—a temporary court \norder requiring the agencies to turn the funding spigots back on, at least while their \ncase is pending.  (ECF No. 26.) \nThe Nonprofits’ Motion is GRANTED.  To summarize: the Court first sees no \nthreshold jurisdictional issues.  The Nonprofits have demonstrated standing against \nall seven defendants and the doctrine of claim-splitting does not narrow their case.  \nSee Part III.A.  Next, the Court is confident that it has jurisdiction under the APA.  \nMost importantly, the seven agency actions here are “final,” allowing APA review, \nand the Nonprofits’ claims are not simple contract actions for money damages, such \nthat the Tucker Act would divest the Court of jurisdiction.  See Part III.B.1. \nLooking to the merits, the Court holds that the Nonprofits have demonstrated \na strong likelihood of success on two of their three APA claims.  First, they have \nadequately shown at least three ways that the sudden, indefinite freeze of all already-\nawarded IIJA and IRA money was arbitrary and capricious: it was neither reasonable \nnor reasonably explained, and it also failed to account for any reliance interests.  See \nPart III.B.2.  Second, the broad powers that OMB, the NEC Director, and the five \nAgencies assert are nowhere to be found in federal law.  The Agencies likely possess \nnarrower powers related to individualized funding pauses and terminations, but in \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 5 of 63 PageID #:\n654\n \ncases of vast economic and political significance—like this one—the Supreme Court \nhas urged lower courts to be skeptical of agencies’ sweeping claims of power.  That is \nto say: those narrower powers cannot justify the broad exercise of authority that \nOMB, the NEC Director, and the Agencies asserted here.  See Part III.B.3.  Holding \nthat these two claims are likely to be successful, the Court declines to address the \nthird at this point.  See Part III.B.4. \nThe Court further holds that the Nonprofits have adequately demonstrated \nirreparable harm in several forms, see Part III.C, and that the balance of the equities \nand the public interest weigh heavily in their favor.  See Part III.D.  And because of \nthese claims’ unique nature, the broad powers that the Government asserts, and the \nharms inflicted on the Nonprofits and similarly situated nonparties, the Court holds \nthat a nationwide injunction is appropriate.  See Part III.F.   \nThe Court wants to be crystal clear: elections have consequences and the \nPresident is entitled to enact his agenda.  The judiciary does not and cannot decide \nwhether his policies are sound.  In other words, “the wisdom” of his decisions “is none \nof our concern.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. \n1, 35 (2020) (cleaned up).  But where the federal courts are constitutionally required \nto weigh in—meaning we, by law, have no choice but to do so—are cases “about the \nprocedure” (or lack thereof) that the Government follows in trying to enact those \npolicies.  Id.  Agencies do not have unlimited authority to further a President’s \nagenda, nor do they have unfettered power to hamstring in perpetuity two statutes \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 6 of 63 PageID #:\n655\n \npassed by Congress during the previous administration.  Chief Justice Roberts put it \nbest:  \nJustice Holmes famously wrote that “men must turn square corners when they \ndeal with the Government.”  But it is also true, particularly when so much is \nat stake, that the Government should turn square corners in dealing with the \npeople. \n \nId. at 24 (cleaned up).  Here, the Government failed to do so. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Court begins with a preliminary statement of facts.   \nA.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction \nAct \nAt the heart of this case are two laws passed by both chambers of Congress and \nsigned by the President.  See U.S. Const., art. I, § 7, cl. 2–3.  The first is the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, passed in \n2021.  (ECF No. 21 ¶ 25.)  The IIJA appropriated huge sums of money for an array of \ninitiatives; since its passage, it has funded a “wide variety of critical projects and \ninitiatives that are administered by different agencies.”  Id. ¶ 25.  For instance, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has already awarded nearly $69 billion in \nIIJA funds “to create jobs, lower energy costs, save families money, support clean \nenergy manufacturing, and help communities burdened by pollution.”  Id. ¶ 26.  And \nthe Department of Interior has doled out IIJA funds to “close open mine portals \n(protecting homes from landslides), clean up orphaned oil and gas wells, and support \nthe federal wildland firefighting workforce.”  Id. \n  The second law is the Inflation Reduction Act, Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. \n1818, passed in 2022.  Like the IIJA, the IRA authorized and appropriated “billions \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 7 of 63 PageID #:\n656\n \nof dollars in funding for grants, loans, and other forms of federal financial assistance \nin order to advance these goals.”  Id. ¶ 23.  And like the IIJA, its programs “are \nadministered  by  various  agencies.”   Id.  ¶ 24.    The  Department  of  Agriculture \n(“USDA”), for instance, handles billions of IRA dollars.  Id.  That includes nearly $20 \nbillion for the Natural Resources Conservation Service to “help farmers, ranchers, \nand other landowners protect natural resources and enhance production, and $13.2 \nbillion to build electrification infrastructure.”  Id. \nB.  Agencies’ administration of IIJA and IRA funds \nFollowing  the  IIJA  and  the  IRA’s  respective  enactments,  agencies  began \nworking with states and private organizations to execute the statutes’ goals.   \n  Take the Childhood Lead Action Project (“CLAP”).  (ECF No. 26-7.)  It is an \naward-winning  nonprofit  that  works  with  state  and  local  officials  to  eliminate \nchildhood lead poisoning in Rhode Island.  Id. ¶ 1, 6.  EPA awarded CLAP a $500,000 \ngrant of IRA money “to fund a multi-pronged, multi-year campaign to address lead \npoisoning in Providence.”  Id. ¶ 7.  It began drawing down funds from this grant in \nDecember 2024 and January 2025.  Id. ¶ 11. \nOr consider the Green Infrastructure Center (“GIC”), a conservation-focused \nnonprofit.  (ECF No. 26-4.)  In 2023 and 2024, GIC received several multi-year grants \nthrough the IRA.  Id. ¶ 9.  More specifically, the IRA provided $1.5 billion in funding \nfor the Urban and Community Forestry Program, run by the U.S. Forest Service, and \nthe GIC—as a subgrantee of several states—uses IRA grant funds “to help towns and \nlocalities plan and carry out plans for planting more trees and managing the forests \nthat they have.”  Id. ¶ 8–11. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 8 of 63 PageID #:\n657\n \nSimilarly,  the  Codman  Square  Neighborhood  Development  Corporation \n(“CSNDC”) applied for a grant through the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, \nrun by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).  (ECF No. 26-\n3 ¶ 6.)  CSNDC is a nonprofit community development corporation that focuses on \nhousing initiatives.  Id. ¶ 2.  And the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program “is meant \nto support investments in energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reductions, and healthy \nhousing” in HUD-run housing.  Id. ¶ 6.  The IRA provides the money for it, and \nCSNDC sought the grant “to help fund a rehab and renovation project on a 31-unit \naffordable housing development for elderly residents here in Dorchester.”  Id. ¶ 7.  \nLast November, HUD awarded CSNDC a $750,000 grant, and it soon received the \naward letter.  Id. ¶ 9.   \nThese are only three examples of the numerous organizations whose missions \nand  projects  depend  on  congressional  funding—as  well  as  effective  agency \nadministration of that funding.  The record shows that agencies were generally \neffective in administering these funds for several years following the IIJA and the \nIRA’s passages.  See, e.g., ECF No. 26-5 ¶¶ 9–12; ECF No. 26-3 ¶ 9; ECF No. 26-4 ¶ 6; \nECF No. 26-6 ¶¶ 6, 14; ECF No. 26-7 ¶ 6; ECF No. 26-9 ¶ 4. \nC.  The Unleashing American Energy executive order \nThat all changed on January 20, 2025, when the President issued an executive \norder titled Unleashing American Energy, Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8343 \n(Jan. 20, 2025) (the “Unleashing EO”).   \nThe  order  provided  that  all  “agencies  shall  immediately  pause  the \ndisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 9 of 63 PageID #:\n658\n \n(Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-\n58).”  Id. § 7(a).  While the funds were paused, the Unleashing EO required the \nagencies to “review their processes, policies, and program for issuing grants, loans, \ncontracts,  or  any  other  financial  disbursement  of  such  appropriated  funds  for \nconsistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.”2   Id.   \nAnd “within 90 days,” all agency heads must “submit a report to the Director \nof the NEC and Director of OMB “detailing their findings.”  Id.  Going forward, “no \nfunds identified in this subsection” could “be disbursed by a given agency until the \nDirector of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined \nthat such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have \nchosen to adopt.”  Id. \nD.  Memorandum M-25-11 \nThe next day, Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget (“OMB”), and Kevin Hassett, Assistant to the President for Economic \nPolicy and Director of the National Economic Council (“NEC”), issued a memorandum \nto the heads of departments and agencies titled, “Guidance Regarding Section 7 of \nthe  Executive  Order  Unleashing  American  Energy”  (“Unleashing Guidance”), \nnumbered M-25-11.  (ECF No. 21-1.)   \n \n2  Section  2,  in  turn,  describes  nine  policy  goals,  including  encouraging  “energy \nexploration and production on Federal lands and waters … in order to meet the needs \nof our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the \nfuture” and protecting the country’s “economic and national security and military \npreparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily \naccessible in every State and territory of the nation.”  § 2(a), (c). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 10 of 63 PageID #:\n659\n \nIt explained that the Unleashing EO “requires agencies to immediately pause \ndisbursement of funds appropriated under” the IRA and the IIJA, but that the pause \n“only  applies  to  funds  supporting  programs,  projects,  or  activities  that  may  be \nimplicated  by  the  policy  established  in  Section  2  of  the  order.”    Id.    “This \ninterpretation” of the Unleashing EO, it explained, “is consistent with section 7’s \nheading (‘Terminating the Green New Deal’) and its reference to the ‘law and the \npolicy outlined in section 2 of th[e] order.’”  Id.  So, “for the purposes of implementing \nsection  7  of  the  Order,  funds  supporting  the  ‘Green  New  Deal’  refer  to  any \nappropriations for objectives that contravene the policies established in section 2,” \nbut “agency heads may disburse funds as they deem necessary after consulting with \nthe Office of Management and Budget.”  Id. (cleaned up). \nE.  The “freeze” \nAfter that, agencies broadly paused funding.  For instance, on January 27, EPA \nissued a memo explaining that “all disbursements for unliquidated obligations funded \nby any line of accounting including funds appropriated by the [IIJA and the IRA] are \npaused”  and  that,  in  accordance  with  the  Unleashing  EO,  “unobligated  funds \n(including unobligated comments) appropriated by the [IRA and IIJA] are paused.”  \n(ECF No. 21-2 at 2).  “All related actions” were paused, too.  Id.  EPA grant recipients \nsoon received notice of the same.  (ECF No. 21-3.)  And similar freezes occurred at the \nother Agencies.  See, e.g., ECF No. 21-7 (Interior); ECF No. 21-8 (USDA); ECF No. 21-\n9 (Energy); ECF No. 21 ¶ 24 n.3 (article describing HUD’s funding freeze).   \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 11 of 63 PageID #:\n660\n \nWhat  did  this  about-face  look  like  for  the  Government’s  partners  on  the \nground?  The record suggests a combination of confusion and silence.  Organizations \nsoon started to notice that their funding became inaccessible.  CSNDC said that \n“HUD stopped communicating with us after the change in administration.”  (ECF \nNo. 26-3 ¶ 10.)  Weeks later, HUD told CSNDC that it was not able “to approve \nclosings or disbursements at that time,” blaming it “on an executive order called \nUnleashing American Energy.”  Id.  Another nonprofit, the Woonasquatucket River \nWatershed Council (“WRWC”), had a grant of $1 million frozen.  (ECF No. 26-4 ¶ 7.)  \nIt learned from the U.S. Forest Service that “the money was inaccessible because it \nwas funded under the Inflation Reduction Act.”  Id.   \nSince the freeze, another organization has had “intermittent trouble accessing \nfederal funding” thorough their already-awarded grants from several agencies.  (ECF \nNo. 26-6 ¶ 9.)  In early February, they suddenly “became unable to access the ‘ASAP’ \nportal, which is an online system that the federal government uses for disbursing \nfunds on grants.”  Id. ¶ 10.  The result?  They “couldn’t make any draw downs of three \ngrants.”  Id.  CLAP—the lead nonprofit—faced similar issues.  (ECF No. 26-7 ¶ 12.)  \nIt explained that sometimes, it was “blocked entirely” from accessing ASAP; other \ntimes, it “could log into the portal, but our grant was missing.”  Id.  The portal tottered \nbetween functioning and not, but the point is that CLAP’s grant was “missing” and \n“EPA [had] not explained why.”  (ECF No. 26-7 ¶ 15.) \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 12 of 63 PageID #:\n661\n \nF.  This case \nEnter WRWC and its co-plaintiffs: the Eastern Rhode Island Conservation \nDistrict, CLAP, CSDNC, GIC, and the National Council of Nonprofits (“NCN”).  They \nallege that the funding freeze orders issued by OMB and Director Hassett and the \nAgencies’ actions in furtherance of the orders violated the APA.  In particular, the \nNonprofits have sued: \n•  the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its Secretary, Brooke Rollins; \n•  the U.S. Department of Energy and its Secretary, Chris Wright; \n•  the U.S. Department of the Interior and its Secretary, Doug Burgum; \n•  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and  its  Secretary,  Lee \nZeldin; \n•  the  U.S.  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  and  its \nSecretary, Scott Turner; \n•  the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director, Russell \nVought; and \n•  the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.  \nOn March 17, the Nonprofits moved for a preliminary injunction.  (ECF No. 26.)  \nFollowing a shortened briefing schedule, the Court held a hearing on their motion on \nApril 3, 2025. \nII.  STANDARD \n“A request for a preliminary injunction is a request for extraordinary relief.”  \nCushing v. Packard, 30 F.4th 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2022).  “To secure a preliminary \ninjunction, a plaintiff must show: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, \n(2) a significant risk of irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld, (3) a favorable \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 13 of 63 PageID #:\n662\n \nbalance of hardships, and (4) a fit (or lack of friction) between the injunction and the \npublic interest.”  NuVasive, Inc. v. Day, 954 F.3d 439, 443 (1st Cir. 2020) (cleaned \nup).  Here, the last two factors merge because the Government is the opposing party.  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \n“The first two factors” here “are the most critical.”  Id. at 434.  “To demonstrate \nlikelihood of success on the merits, plaintiffs must show more than mere possibility \nof success—rather, they must establish a strong likelihood that they will ultimately \nprevail.”  Sindicato Puertorriqueño de Trabajadores, SEIU Loc. 1996 v. Fortuño, 699 \nF.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (cleaned up).  In evaluating whether the \nNonprofits have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, the Court must keep in \nmind that the merits need not be “conclusively determine[d]”; instead, at this stage, \ndecisions “are to be understood as statements of probable outcomes only.”  Akebia \nTherapeutics, Inc. v. Azar, 976 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir. 2020) (cleaned up).   \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.   Jurisdiction \nTo start, the Government makes two jurisdictional arguments trying to narrow \nthe case’s scope.  The first is about standing while the second concerns claim splitting.  \nBefore  addressing  the  preliminary  injunction  factors,  the  Court  considers  these \narguments.  \n1.  Defendant-specific standing \nThe Government first argues that the Nonprofits have not shown any injuries \nattributable to Energy, OMB, or the NEC Director.  (ECF No. 31 at 15.)  Of course, \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 14 of 63 PageID #:\n663\n \nthe Nonprofits “bear the burden of demonstrating that they have standing” and must \ndo so “with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of \nthe litigation.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 430–31 (2021) (cleaned \nup).  And they “must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for \neach form of relief that they seek.”  Id. at 431.  “To establish standing,” they “must \nshow an injury in fact caused by the defendant and redressable by a court order.” \nUnited States v. Texas, No. 22-58, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023).  The upshot of the \nGovernment’s standing argument is that any relief should be directed “only against \nUSDA, Interior, EPA, and HUD—and not the three other Agency Defendants for \nwhich Plaintiffs have failed to prove any ongoing injuries.”3  (ECF No. 31 at 17.)  The \nCourt addresses the standing arguments individually.   \na.  Energy \nAs for Energy, the Government contends first that, as a matter of fact, “there \nis no ongoing pause of funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program since at \nleast February 2025.”  (ECF No. 31 at 15.)  And in any event, the alleged harm is to \n“a subrecipient (not a direct grantee) of DOE funding,” so the entity “should contact \nthe direct grantee to raise any concerns about any alleged improper pause of funding.”  \nId. at 16.   \n \n3 Aside from the same subgrantee issue raised against Energy, the Government does \nnot contest that the Nonprofits have standing for claims against EPA, HUD, Interior, \nand USDA.  (ECF No. 38 at 50–51.)  Upon an independent review of the record, the \nCourt is satisfied that the Nonprofits have standing as to those four agencies and \ntheir heads, at least for purposes of resolving this motion. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 15 of 63 PageID #:\n664\n \nThe Nonprofits respond that Energy has “continued to block access to IRA and \nIIJA funding even after February 24, when its claims to have resumed processing \npayments.”  (ECF No. 32 at 17.)  Further, the Government’s subgrantee argument is \na red herring, the Nonprofits say, because the record shows that “there is no concern \nthat the direct grantee (the state in which the declarant’s organization is located) is \nfailing to pass funds on to the subgrantee.”  (ECF No. 32 at 16 n.5.)  In other words, \nthe blame still lies at Energy’s feet. \nAt this stage, the Nonprofits have adequately shown an injury-in-fact against \nEnergy.  To start, the declarant in the Nonprofits’ Exhibit T, an executive director of \na nonprofit member of NCN, reported on March 11 that their IIJA funding had been \nfrozen since January 30 and that they “have not received any communications about \nthe cause of this freeze or if or when it will end.”  (ECF No. 26-11 ¶ 12.)  For now, that \nis enough to show that an injury caused by Energy existed at the time the Nonprofits \nfiled their Complaint. \nTrue, the Government has provided conflicting testimony: a signed declaration \nfrom an Energy official stating that, “since February 24, 2025, for obligations with \nongoing work, DOE is proceeding with payments in the normal course.”  (ECF No. 31-\n2 ¶ 5.)  That contrary evidence, though, does not bear on the standing analysis.  Under \nthe  Government’s  theory,  if  simply  offering  contrary  evidence  always  defeated \nstanding, then few cases would ever get very far.   \nAnd the declarant’s status as a subgrantee is not fatal to standing against \nEnergy.  To start, nothing in the testimony suggests that the state “is failing to pass \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 16 of 63 PageID #:\n665\n \nfunds on,” as the Government suggests.  See, e.g., ECF No. 32-3 ¶¶ 5–6.  And at \nargument, the Government cast this subgrantee argument as a “sort of zone of \ninterest or rights to enforce” argument.   (ECF No. 38 at 51–52.)   The APA authorizes \nsuit to challenge a federal agency by any “person” who was “adversely affected or \naggrieved ... within the meaning of a relevant statute.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The Supreme \nCourt has explained: \nWe have held that this language establishes a regime under which a plaintiff \nmay not sue unless he falls within the “zone of interests” sought to be protected \nby  the  statutory  provision  whose  violation  forms  the  legal  basis  for  his \ncomplaint.  We have described the “zone of interests” test as denying a right of \nreview if the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent \nwith the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed \nthat Congress intended to permit the suit. \nThompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP,  562  U.S.  170,  177–78  (2011)  (cleaned  up).  \nBecause,  as  explained  below,  the  Government’s  actions  implicate  a  breadth  of \nstatutory schemes and regulations, the exact statutory analysis is difficult to pin \ndown.  But that is a problem of the Government’s making, and the Nonprofits’ \ninterests  in  their  already-awarded  funds  being  frozen  by  the  Agencies,  even  as \nsubgrantees, at the behest of OMB and the NEC Director, are not “so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit” in all the statutory schemes \nimplicated here as to defeat standing.  Id.  After all, the Nonprofits’ already-awarded \nfunds are themselves “the subject of the contested regulatory action.”  Clarke v. Sec. \nIndus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987). \nNor  does  the  fact  that  some  funding  under  Energy’s  purview  has  been \ntemporarily unfrozen, see ECF No. 32-3 ¶¶ 4–7, moot the Nonprofits’ case against \nEnergy.  A case only becomes moot, the First Circuit has explained, if “the defendant \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 17 of 63 PageID #:\n666\n \nmeets the heavy burden of showing that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly \nwrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”  Brown v. Colegio de \nAbogados de Puerto Rico, 613 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir. 2010) (cleaned up).  Put differently, \n“to show that a case is truly moot, a defendant must prove no reasonable expectation \nremains that it will return to its old ways.”  Fed. Bureau of Investigation v. Fikre, \n601 U.S. 234, 241 (2024) (cleaned up).  “That much holds for governmental defendants \nno less than for private ones.”  Id.  The Government has failed to make that showing. \nAll that is to say: the Nonprofits have adequately demonstrated standing \nagainst Energy.   \nb.  OMB \nAs for OMB, the Government argues that the Nonprofits’ declarations “fail to \nidentify any injury attributable specifically to OMB’s actions,” so they “have not \nproven any injuries specifically attributable to OMB itself.”  (ECF No. 31 at 16.)  The \nNonprofits reply that OMB was “responsible for issuing OMB Memo M-25-11,” which \n“directed executive agencies to freeze certain IRA and IIJA funding,” and since then, \n“other agencies relied on it in withholding funds.”  (ECF No. 32 at 17–18.) \nAn injury-in-fact must be “fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \ndefendant.”  Conservation L. Found., Inc. v. Acad. Express, LLC, 129 F.4th 78, 90 (1st \nCir. 2025).  So there must be a “causal connection between the injury and the conduct \ncomplained of,” but the standard “does not require a tort-like showing of proximate \ncausation.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).  And a plaintiff “can satisfy traceability \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 18 of 63 PageID #:\n667\n \nby showing that the defendant’s conduct is one among multiple causes of the alleged \ninjury.”  Id.  (cleaned up).   \nThe Nonprofits’ injuries arising from the freeze are clearly traceable to OMB’s \nissuance of M-25-11 and the memorandum’s influence over the Agency Defendants.  \nThere are at least two reasons why.  First is the Agencies’ actual, cited reliance on M-\n25-11 as the reason for the pause.  One internal memo from EPA ordering the pause \nstated that it was “being provided based on instruction from OMB.”  (ECF No. 21-2 \nat 2.)  Another message from Interior to a grantee who was trying (and failing) to \naccess their funding cited Memo M-25-11 “regarding the funding pause.”  ECF No. 21-\n7 at 2; see also ECF No. 26-9 ¶ 13 (“I understand from our government partners that \nthey believe our IRA funds are still frozen under the authority of OMB Memo M-25-\n11.”).  That is a sufficient causal connection. \nAnother reason is equally illuminating: the Agencies’ sudden about-face on \npausing funds soon after issuance of the memo.  Either release of the memo led to the \npause  of  the  Agencies’  already-awarded  IRA  and  IIJA  funding  or  five  “federal \nagencies, none of which had acted to cut off financial assistance” before the freeze \n“suddenly began exercising their own discretion to suspend funding across the board \nat the exact same time.”  Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. \nCV 25-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 597959, at *7 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025).  As between these \ntwo options, the latter “would be a remarkable—and unfathomable—coincidence.”  Id.  \nAnd that “this uniform freeze occurred” in the days right “after the memorandum’s \nissuance would be quite the happenstance, too.”  Id.  In short, the Government asks \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 19 of 63 PageID #:\n668\n \nthe Court “to overlook the simplest, most logical explanation” for what happened.  Id.  \nThe Court declines. \nc.  NEC Director \nThe Government raises the same traceability arguments for the NEC Director \nas it did OMB.  (ECF No. 31 at 17.)  These arguments fail for the same reasons, given \nthe NEC Director’s co-authorship of the memorandum.  (ECF No. 21-1 at 2.) \nOnly in a footnote, the Government separately argues that Director Hassett is \nnot an “agency” under the APA.  (ECF No. 31 at 17 n.2.)  But the First Circuit has \n“repeatedly held that arguments raised only in a footnote” are “waived.”  Nat’l \nForeign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38, 61 n. 17 (1st Cir. 1999); see also \nModeski v. Summit Retail Sols., Inc., 470 F. Supp. 3d 93, 110 (D. Mass. 2020) (same).   \n2.  Claim splitting  \nNext, the Government argues that the doctrine of claim splitting precludes this \nsuit, because NCN (one of several Plaintiffs here) “and its members are already \nlitigating a case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \n(D.D.C.) challenging the same alleged harms from the ‘federal funding freeze.’”  (ECF \nNo. 31 at 18.)  In its view, this case involves the same plaintiff, “represented by the \nsame counsel, in yet another challenge to an alleged categorical pause in grant \nfunding—with yet another request for emergency, expedited relief.”  Id. at 18–19.  \nAnd even if some Nonprofits here were not NCN members, “that would at most allow \nthose three entities’ claims to proceed—not the claims of NCN or the other two \nPlaintiffs who are participants in the D.D.C. action.”  Id. at 21–22. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 20 of 63 PageID #:\n669\n \nThe Nonprofits reply that they are here challenging “entirely separate agency \nactions, by a much broader set of defendants, to freeze a different category of funds—\ni.e., funding appropriated under the IRA and IIJA.”  (ECF No. 32 at 11.)  And they \nsay that their challenge here does not relate to OMB Memo M-25-13, the agency \naction at issue in the D.D.C. litigation.  Id.    \nThe  doctrine  precluding  claim  splitting  relates  to—but  differs  from—the \ndoctrine of res judicata.  See Curtis v. Citibank, N.A., 226 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2000); \nThe main difference is that claim splitting, unlike res judicata, applies where the \nsecond suit has been filed before the first suit has reached a final judgment.  See 18 \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 4406 (3d ed.) (discussing “principles of ‘claim splitting’ that \nare similar to claim preclusion, but that do not require a prior judgment”). \nStill,  the  doctrines  serve  similar  policies.    First,  “the  power  to  dismiss  a \nduplicative  lawsuit  is  meant  to  foster  judicial  economy  and  the  comprehensive \ndisposition of litigation.”  Curtis, 226 F.3d at 138 (cleaned up).  Claim splitting is \n“concerned with the district court’s comprehensive management of its docket,” while \n“res judicata focuses on protecting the finality of judgments.”  Vanover v. NCO Fin. \nServs., Inc., 857 F.3d 833, 841 (11th Cir. 2017).   \nAnd second—more relevant here—the claim splitting doctrine “is also meant \nto protect parties from the vexation of concurrent litigation over the same subject \nmatter.”  Curtis, 226 F.3d at 138 (cleaned up); see also Clements v. Airport Auth. of \nWashoe Cty., 69 F.3d 321, 328 (9th Cir. 1995) (“A main purpose behind the rule \npreventing  claim  splitting  is  to  protect  the  defendant  from  being  harassed  by \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 21 of 63 PageID #:\n670\n \nrepetitive actions based on the same claim.”).  The point is that a “litigant with \nmultiple  related  claims  must  not  separate,  or  split,  the  claims  into  multiple, \nsuccessive cases, but must include in the first action all of the claims that fall within \nthe Court’s jurisdiction.”  Perry v. Alexander, 2:15-cv-00310-JCN, 2017 WL 3084387, \nat *3 (D. Me. July 19, 2017) (cleaned up). \nFederal courts borrow from the res judicata test to determine whether the \nclaim splitting doctrine applies.  So the Government must show that the first suit, if \nit were final, would preclude the subsequent suits.  See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. \n880, 907 (2008) (“Claim preclusion, like issue preclusion, is an affirmative defense” \nthat the defendant must “plead and prove.”); Vanover, 857 F.3d at 841. \nThe First Circuit employs the “transactional approach” to determine whether \nsuccessive causes of action are the same as the first.  See Mass. Sch. of Law at \nAndover, Inc., v. Am. Bar Ass’n, 142 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 1998).  “Under this approach, \na cause of action is defined as a set of facts which can be characterized as a single \ntransaction or series of related transactions.”  Id.  The essential inquiry, then, is \nwhether “the causes of action arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts.”  Id.  \n“In mounting this inquiry, we routinely ask whether the facts are related in time, \nspace, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether \ntheir treatment as a unit conforms to the parties’ expectations.”  Id. (cleaned up); \nCurtis, 226 F.3d at 139 (holding that claim splitting will apply if “the same or \nconnected transactions are at issue and the same proof is needed to support the claims \nin both suits”). \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 22 of 63 PageID #:\n671\n \nThe Government has not met its burden here.  To start, the universe of agency \naction in these two cases is distinct enough that the Court struggles to see them as \narising “out of a common nucleus of operative facts” or especially as forming “a \nconvenient trial unit.”  142 F.3d at 38.  The D.D.C. plaintiffs challenged a different \nagency action: OMB Memo M-25-13.  Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, \nat *6 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025).  The Nonprofits here challenge another memo, M-25-11, \nalong with five Agencies’ funding freezes arising from that memo.  (ECF No. 21 ¶¶ 82, \n86–87, 92–95, 101–103.) \nThat some overlap occurs—mainly the complicated interplay between different \nOMB memos—is not enough.  The cases are fundamentally different in their factual \nand legal analysis, even if some legal issues appear in both cases.  See New York v. \nTrump, No. 25-CV-39-JJM-PAS, 2025 WL 715621, at *8–*9 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025) \n(separately  analyzing  an  OMB  directive  and  the  “Agency  Defendants’  acts \nimplementing funding pauses” under the guidance).  Most persuasive on this point \nis, as the Nonprofits describe it, the “fact that the district court in NCN v. OMB has \nenjoined  the  directive  in  that  memo”  and  “the  government  has  purportedly \nwithdrawn it.”  (ECF No. 32 at 11 (citing NCN II, 2025 WL 597959, at *3, 19–20)).  \nThe Nonprofits suggest that this fact “only confirms that Defendants’ ongoing freezes \nof IRA and IIJA funding are factually distinct” from the withdrawn memo challenged \nin the D.D.C. litigation.  (ECF No. 32 at 11.)  The Court agrees: the fact that Memo \nM-25-13 is withdrawn and yet the freezes at issue in this case continue illustrates \nwhy the claim-splitting doctrine is unavailing here. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 23 of 63 PageID #:\n672\n \nB.   Likelihood of success on the merits \nThe Court now turns to the Nonprofits’ likelihood of success on the merits of \ntheir three APA claims.  First, they argue that the Government’s funding freeze is \narbitrary and capricious.  (ECF No. 26 at 14–22.)  The freeze, they contend, is neither \n“reasonable”  nor  “reasonably  explained,”  and  each  is  independently  fatal  to  its \nviability.  See Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024).  Second, the Nonprofits submit \nthat the funding freeze exceeds the statutory authority that any of the Defendants \npossess.  (ECF No. 26 at 22–25.)  No statutes allow OMB or the NEC Director to issue \nguidance to freeze funds or allow the five Agencies to freeze any funding appropriated \nby the IRA and IIJA, goes the argument, so their actions were necessarily overreach.  \nFinally, the Nonprofits argue that the funding freeze is contrary to law: both the IRA \nand the IIJA as well as regulatory procedures setting out specific procedures for \nsuspending and terminating grants.  (ECF No. 26 at 25–28.)   \nAt this stage, the Nonprofits need only show a substantial likelihood of success \non one of their three claims.  See, e.g., Worthley v. Sch. Comm. of Gloucester, 652 F. \nSupp. 3d 204, 215 (D. Mass. 2023) (collecting cases). \n1.  Threshold APA issues \nBefore  reaching  the  merits,  though,  the  Court  must  determine  several \nthreshold issues arising under the APA.  Most pressing is whether the Nonprofits are \nlikely to show that the funding freeze constitutes a “final agency action” under the \nAPA.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  If the freeze is not, then it cannot be subject to judicial review.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 24 of 63 PageID #:\n673\n \nThe Government identifies four additional threshold issues.  First is that the \nNonprofits do not really “identify the agency actions” they seek to challenge; the \nfreeze  is  instead  “comprised  of  many  different  actions  by  numerous  different \nagencies,” the ultimate scope being unclear.  (ECF No. 31 at 22–25.)  This matters, \nargues the Government, because it “realistically” cannot “be expected to defend the \nstatutory basis for an undefined universe of agency decisions, let alone explain the \nreasoned decision-making behind each of those unknown decisions.”  Id. at 24. \nThe Government insists that three further defects are fatal.  The claims, in the \nGovernment’s  view,  masquerade  as  a  challenge  to  an  executive  order,  which  is \nunreviewable under the APA.  (ECF No. 31 at 26–29).  They are also “tantamount to \nimpermissibly broad, programmatic challenges to entire agency operations.”  Id. \nat 25, 29–32.  And even viewed in their narrowest form, they are grant-specific \nchallenges that this Court lacks the jurisdiction to adjudicate.  Id. at 32–37.  Instead, \nin the Government’s view, the Tucker Act requires that these claims be asserted in \nthe Court of Federal Claims.  Id. at 33–35.   \na.  Failure to identify agency action \nFirst, the Court disagrees that the Nonprofits have not identified any agency \nactions.  In fact, the Nonprofits make it clear: they are challenging “Defendants’ \nongoing holds on IRA and IIJA funding.”  (ECF No. 32 at 5.)  The First Circuit \nrecently recognized the concrete nature of similar challenges.  New York v. Trump, \nNo. 25-1236, 2025 WL 914788, at *13 (1st Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (“The Plaintiff-States’ \nopposition does identify specific agency actions.  The Plaintiff-States make clear that \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 25 of 63 PageID #:\n674\n \nthey challenge the Agency Defendants’ ‘actions -- following the executive orders and \n[OMB] Directive -- to implement categorical funding freezes without regard and \ncontrary to legal authority.’”)  \nTrue, the Nonprofits are challenging “many different actions by numerous \ndifferent agencies” all at once.  (ECF No. 31 at 24.)  But that does not defeat an APA \nclaim.  The First Circuit is “not aware of any supporting authority for the proposition \nthat the APA bars a plaintiff from challenging a number of discrete final agency \nactions all at once.”  New York, 2025 WL 914788, at *13 (1st Cir. Mar. 26, 2025).  Nor \ndoes the Government identify any.  Id.  And the Nonprofits’ broad challenges only \narise because OMB, the NEC Director, and the five Agency Defendants froze all the \nfunding in concert.  So the Government’s actions here are hardly an “undefined \nuniverse of agency decisions.”  (ECF No. 31 at 24.)   \nThe Court can be more specific.  The universe boils down to five agencies \n(Energy, EPA, HUD, Interior, and USDA) deciding summarily to withhold already-\nawarded funds appropriated by Congress under two laws, the IIJA and the IRA, \nbased on compliance with a directive from OMB and the NEC Director.  Or more \nsimply, there are seven agency actions here: OMB and the NEC Director’s decisions \nto issue the Unleashing Guidance mandating a pause (one action from each) and \nEnergy,  EPA,  HUD,  Interior,  and  USDA’s  decisions  to  follow  that  guidance  by \nsummarily freezing IIJA and IRA funds (one action from each of these five agencies).4   \n \n4 Whether these agency decisions are “final” is discussed below at Part III.B.1.e.   \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 26 of 63 PageID #:\n675\n \nRecord  evidence  makes  the  Government’s  feigned  confusion  on  this  point \nparticularly puzzling.  When one grantee logged onto the ASAP portal, for instance, \nthe code for the pause to their funds was “IRA/BIL Hold,” abbreviations for the \nInflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also \nknown as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or “BIL”).  (ECF No. 32-4 ¶ 8.)  How \ndifficult  could  it  really  be  for  the  Government  to  figure  out  which  actions  are \nchallenged if there is already a specific computer code for these universal pauses? \nb.  Backdoor challenge to an executive order \nSecond, the Court does not see the Nonprofits’ claims as a backdoor challenge \nto an executive order.  The Government recognizes that the Nonprofits “do not seek \nrelief directly against the President’s Executive Order,” (ECF No. 31 at 26 n.3), and \nin any event, the Nonprofits can challenge the implementation of an order without \nchallenging the order itself—particularly when they cast the Unleashing EO as a \n“narrow” one and make a compelling argument that the Government has in fact failed \nto comply with it to the letter.  See ECF No. 26 at 18; see also Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits,  2025  WL  368852,  at  *11  (D.D.C.  Feb.  3,  2025) (“[F]urthering  the \nPresident’s wishes cannot be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases.”)   \nc.  Programmatic attack \nThird, the Nonprofits’ claims are not the improper programmatic attack that \nthe Government paints them to be.  The Government’s argument is unconvincing in \npart for the same reasons as its argument about the Nonprofits’ failure to identify \nany agency action.   \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 27 of 63 PageID #:\n676\n \nFurther guidance from the First Circuit bolsters the Court’s conclusion.  It \nrecently, roundly rejected a similar argument in New York, 2025 WL 914788, at *12–\n13, and that reasoning applies equally here.  The Supreme Court previously made \nclear that an agency’s action in “applying some particular measure across the board” \ncould “of course be challenged under the APA.”  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 \nU.S. 871, 890 n.2 (1990).  And as in New York, that is what happened here.  The First \nCircuit explained:  \nThe District Court determined here, by contrast, that the Plaintiff-States’ APA \nclaims do challenge discrete final agency actions.  To be sure, those claims, like \nthe motion for the preliminary injunction, describe those actions, collectively, \nas  the  ‘Federal  Funding  Freeze.’    The  District  Court  at  points  uses  that \nnomenclature as well.  But the claims themselves, like the motion, assert that \nthe discrete final agency actions are the decisions by the Agency Defendants to \nimplement broad, categorical freezes on obligated funds. \n \nNew York, 2025 WL 914788, at *12 (1st Cir. Mar. 26, 2025).  So too here. \nThe Court finds the Government’s alternate characterization of its actions as \n“thousands of individual decisions made by agencies about whether particular grants \nor other funding should be paused” unconvincing.  (ECF No. 31 at 31.)  Of course, in \nreviewing the record, a court is “not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary \ncitizens are free.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (cleaned up); \nNew York, 2025 WL 914788, at *13 (1st Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (same).  And, as explained \nabove, the contention that these agencies “suddenly began exercising their own \ndiscretion to suspend funding across the board at the exact same time” is truly \ndoubtful,  because  it  requires  “unfathomable,”  “coincidental  assumptions”  and \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 28 of 63 PageID #:\n677\n \n“contradicts the record.” Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, at *7 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 25, 2025). \nAfter all, it “is unclear whether twenty-four hours is sufficient time for an \nagency to independently review a single grant, let alone hundreds of thousands of \nthem.”  Id. at *15 (cleaned up); see also New York, 2025 WL 715621, at *8 (D.R.I. \nMar. 6, 2025) (“To suggest that the challenged federal funding freezes were purely \nthe result of independent agency decisions rather than the OMB Directive or the \nUnleashing Guidance is disingenuous.”). \nd.  Tucker Act  \nAnd fourth, the Court disagrees that these APA claims are outside the scope of \nits jurisdiction.  Most relevant to this argument, the Tucker Act does not apply here, \neither to the Unleashing Guidance or the Agencies’ freezes.  See Massachuetts v. Nat’l \nInstitutes of Health, No. 25-CV-10338, 2025 WL 702163, at *4–*8 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, \n2025) (laying out the framework for an APA-Tucker Act analysis).   \nThe Tucker Act “confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Federal Claims over the \nspecified categories of actions brought against the United States.”  Fisher v.

So \nplaintiffs wishing to file “a suit against the United States involving a contract” where \nthe “relief [sought is] over $10,000” must do so in the Court of Federal Claims.  Vill. \nW. Assocs. v.

Supp. 2d 134, 138 (D.R.I. 2009). \nThe “jurisdictional boundary” between the Tucker Act and the APA is well-\ntraversed by litigants seeking relief against the federal government.  Suburban \nMortg. Assocs., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 480 F.3d 1116, 1117 (Fed. Cir. \n2007).  Still, the boundary’s precise contours remain elusive.  See id. at 1124 (listing \ncases treading the jurisdictional line); Bublitz v. Brownlee, 309 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 \n(D.D.C. 2004) (noting “[t]he bright-line rule” between monetary and equitable relief \nin the Tucker Act–APA context “turns out to be rather dim ....”).

Donley, 886 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 \n(D.D.C. 2012) (cleaned up). \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  made  clear  that  “not  every  claim  invoking  the \nConstitution, a federal statute, or a regulation is cognizable under the Tucker Act.” \nUnited States v.

United States, No. 08-CV-\n2402, 2010 WL 11545698, at *5 (D.P.R. Jan. 26, 2010) (cleaned up); see also R.I. Hous. \n& Mortg. Fin. Corp., 618 F. Supp. 2d at 138. \nWhile the First Circuit has not formally adopted the “rights and remedies” test \nthat is used by several other circuits, district courts within it have adopted the test \nto  determine  whether  the  “essence”  of  an  action  is  truly  contractual.    See \nMassachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, at *4–*8; R.I. Hous. & Mortg. Fin. Corp., 618 F. \nSupp. 2d at 138; Piñeiro, 2010 WL 11545698, at *5.  This Court adopts the same \nframework, derived from Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982), \nand discusses each element in turn. \nFirst, the Court considers the source of the Nonprofits’ rights.  After examining \nthe Complaint, the Court finds that, like in Massachusetts v. NIH, “the gravamen” of \nthe Nonprofits’ allegations “does not turn on terms of a contract between the parties; \nit turns on federal statute and regulations put in place by Congress” and the agencies.  \nMassachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, at *6; see, e.g., K-Mar Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nDef., 752 F. Supp. 2d 1207, 1214 (W.D. Okla. 2010) (“The source of the rights alleged \nin this action is not contractual, it is the procedures put in place by the defendants.”)   \nThe  Government  largely  seems  to  agree.    As  it  explained  in  its  brief, \n“Determining  whether  a  pause  on  disbursement  is  lawful  necessarily  requires \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 31 of 63 PageID #:\n680\n \nexamining  the  underlying  statutes  governing  a  program,  the  appropriations \nmeasures providing funding for the program, and potentially the specific terms and \nconditions included in the grant agreement for that program.”  (ECF No. 31 at 24.)5  \nThroughout their briefing, neither the Nonprofits nor the Government have pointed \nthe Court to specific terms and conditions in the grant agreements. \nTo  be  clear:  the  fact  that  there  are  underlying  contractual  relationships \nbetween the Nonprofits and the Government does not automatically “convert a claim \nasserting rights based on federal regulations into one which is, at its essence, a \ncontract claim.”  Normandy Apartments, Ltd. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 554 \nF.3d 1290, 1299 (10th Cir. 2009) (cleaned up).  As in Massachusetts, the Nonprofits \n“have not requested the Court to examine any contract or grant agreement created \nbetween the parties.”  Massachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, at *6.  Instead, they “have \nasked  this  Court  to  review  and  interpret  the  governing  federal  statute  and \nregulations.”  Id.   \nHaving recognized that the source of the Nonprofits’ rights is federal law \nrather than contract, the Court now turns to the relief sought.  There is a “distinction \nbetween an action at law for damages,” which provides monetary compensation, and \n“an equitable action for specific relief,” which might still require monetary relief.  \nBowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988); see Great-W. Life & Annuity Ins. \n \n5 True, the Government suggests, in that same quote, that it is “potentially” necessary \nto examine “the specific terms and conditions included in the grant agreement for \nthat  program.”    (ECF  No. 31  at 24.)    But  that  caveat  does  not  defeat  its  clear \nrecognition that federal statutes and regulations largely control the analysis here.   \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 32 of 63 PageID #:\n681\n \nv. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 213 (2002) (“Whether [restitution] is legal or equitable \ndepends on the basis for [the plaintiff’s] claim and the nature of the underlying \nremedies sought.”) (cleaned up).  Simply because “a judicial remedy may require one \nparty to pay money to another” does not necessarily “characterize the relief as money \ndamages.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893.  A hallmark of such equitable actions is the \nexistence of prospective relief in ongoing relationships.  Compare Bowen, 487 U.S. \nat 905  (holding  that  the  district  court  had  jurisdiction  because  declaratory  or \ninjunctive  relief  was  appropriate  to  clarify  petitioner  state’s  ongoing  obligations \nunder the Medicaid plan), with Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. \n296, 298 (2020) (holding that petitioners properly relied on the Tucker Act to sue for \ndamages in the Court of Federal Claims because plaintiffs were strictly concerned \nwith “specific sums already calculated, past due, and designed to compensate for \ncompleted labors”). \nThe Nonprofits’ primary purpose in bringing their claims is to seek equitable, \nnot monetary, relief.  They do not bring claims for past pecuniary harms.  Rather, \nlike the plaintiffs in Bowen and Massachusetts, “their claims are to preserve their \nongoing and prospective” agreements with the Government.  Massachusetts, 2025 \nWL 702163, at *7.  And the various harms the Nonprofits identified correspond to \nthat relief.  The Nonprofits indicate that the blanket IIJA and IRA funding freezes \nwill result in lost jobs, a suspension of research and community initiatives, and a loss \nof  goodwill.   See infra, Part  III.C  (discussing  these  irreparable  injuries,  among \nothers).  Ultimately, these harms are the ones for which the Nonprofits are pleading \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 33 of 63 PageID #:\n682\n \nrelief.  It would be legal error to construe the claims as couched pleas for monetary \nrelief for which the Nonprofits never asked.   \nSince the Court finds that the proper source of the Nonprofits’ rights is federal \nstatute and regulations and because the relief sought is injunctive in nature, the \nCourt determines that the “essence” of the action is not contractual in nature.  R.I. \nHous. & Mortg. Fin. Corp., 618 F. Supp. 2d at 138.  So the Nonprofits’ claims cannot \nproperly be brought under the Tucker Act in the Court of Federal Claims and this \nCourt retains jurisdiction. \nThe Supreme Court’s recent order in Department of Education v. California, \n145 S.Ct. 966 (Apr. 4, 2025), is not to the contrary.  The Supreme Court noted that \nthe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to claims seeking money \ndamages, but also reaffirmed the general rule that “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is \nnot barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s action may result \nin the disbursement of funds.”  Id. at 968 (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910).  The \nGovernment overreads the three-page stay order.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n434  (2009)  (explaining  that  the  issuance  of  a  stay  “is  dependent  upon  the \ncircumstances of the particular case”).  The Supreme Court’s brief treatment of \nBowen  and Great-West Life  in California  and  the  cursory  mention  of  potential \njurisdictional issues do not appear to settle all jurisdictional issues here, despite the \nGovernment’s arguments to the contrary.6 \n \n6 The Court digresses briefly to note something funny.  At oral argument following \nthe First Circuit’s decision in California, but prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, \nthe Government argued that California was not “binding at this stage given the stay \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 34 of 63 PageID #:\n683\n \nInstead, Bowen mandates that a careful examination of the Nonprofits’ claims \nand the relief sought—as the Court has done here—are necessary.  To the extent that \nthe Court’s order “engenders” the result of payment to the Nonprofits, “this outcome \nis  a  mere  by-product”  of  the  Court’s  “primary  function  of  reviewing  the \n[Government’s] interpretation of federal law.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. 879, 910.  And “even \nif” the Court’s orders “are construed in part as orders for the payment of money by \nthe Federal Government” to the Nonprofits, Bowen makes clear that those “payments \nare not ‘money damages,’” and that the “orders are not excepted from § 702’s grant of \npower by § 704.”  Id.  Put differently, “since the orders are for specific relief (they undo \nthe [Government’s freeze of funds]) rather than for money damages (they do not \nprovide relief that substitutes for that which ought to have been done) they are \nwithin” the Court’s jurisdiction.  Id.  That is especially clear for any relief against \nOMB and the NEC Director, because the Nonprofits’ claims against them rest solely \non their lack of authority to direct other agencies to freeze funds. \nIn short, the Court cannot disregard Bowen.  Even if it looks like California \nmay have “implicitly overruled” it, the Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that \n \nposture of that decision” and was also “fundamentally different” and “distinguishable \nbecause that case involved actual termination of the relevant grants.”  (ECF No. 39 \nat 83–84.)  But now the Government insists that California divests the Court of \njurisdiction and says that the Nonprofits’ effort “to portray [California] as ‘readily \ndistinguishable’ ring hollow.”  (ECF No. 41 at 3.)  What changed?  The Court’s best \nguess: a result that the Government now favors.  Its change in tune—and, to be fair, \nthe Nonprofits’ as well, in their new efforts to distance themselves from California—\nhighlights the challenges of pinning down the precedential effects of emergency \ndecisions.  That is part of why the Court declines to hold that the Supreme Court \noverruled Bowen and its progeny via stay order.  \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 35 of 63 PageID #:\n684\n \nlower courts “should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] \nCourt the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”  Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., \n600 U.S. 122, 136 (2023).  That is true even if the lower court “thinks the precedent \nis in tension with some other line of decisions”—or here, rather than an entire \ncompeting “line of decisions,” a single three-page per curiam order granting a stay.  \nSee Merrill v. Milligan, 142 S. Ct. 879, 879 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“The \nprincipal dissent’s catchy but worn-out rhetoric about the ‘shadow docket’ is similarly \noff target.  The stay will allow this Court to decide the merits in an orderly fashion—\nafter full briefing, oral argument, and our usual extensive internal deliberations—\nand ensure that we do not have to decide the merits on the emergency docket.  To \nreiterate: The Court’s stay order is not a decision on the merits”); accord id. at 883 \n(Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (critiquing the Supreme Court’s emergency orders for \nnecessitating decisions without the opportunity for “full briefing and argument—\nbased on the scanty review this Court gives matters on its shadow docket”).  And the \ncase that “directly controls,” the one that the Court must follow, is Bowen. \nOther district courts facing similar issues have similarly held that California \ndid not divest them of jurisdiction.  Maine v. United States Dep’t of Agric., No. 1:25-\nCV-00131-JAW, 2025 WL 1088946, at *19 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025); New York v. Trump, \nNo. 25-cv-39-JJM-PAS, ECF No. 182 at 5–9 (D.R.I. Apr. 14, 2025).  In addition to the \nreasons already provided, the Court agrees and adopts their reasoning in full to the \nextent it applies here. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 36 of 63 PageID #:\n685\n \ne.  “Final agency action” test \nAll that aside, the Court must determine whether there was “final agency \naction” under 5 U.S.C. § 704.  A final agency action has two essential qualities.  First, \nit “marks the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process.”  Corner Post, \nInc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 808 (2024) (cleaned up).  And \nsecond, it either is an action “by which rights or obligations have been determined, or \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”  Id. (cleaned up).   \nTo the first point, the Nonprofits argue that the “sweeping halts to the ordinary \npayment and processing” of appropriated funds mark “the consummation” of the \ndecision-making process because “there are no further steps the agencies need to take \nto determine whether they will freeze that funding.”  (ECF No. 26 at 13.)  And to the \nsecond, they argue that “legal consequences” have flowed from the decisions, because \ntheir “direct result (and express purpose)” was “to cut off access to funding for \ngrantees and others who would otherwise have a right to apply for, draw on, or \notherwise access these funds.”  Id. at 14. \nThe Government declines to engage with that test.  Along with the threshold \nissues discussed above, it instead argues that, rather than a reviewable “final agency \naction,” the funding freeze decisions are “committed to agency discretion by law” \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) and thus unreviewable under the APA.  (ECF No. 31 at 35–\n36.)  In its view, the Agency Defendants’ “decision to stop funding for Plaintiffs’ \nprojects, and to recompete the funds associated with those projects, is the type of \nagency action that is presumptively unreviewable.”  Id. at 36. (quoting Pol’y & Rsch., \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 37 of 63 PageID #:\n686\n \nLLC v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 313 F. Supp. 3d 62, 76 (D.D.C. 2018) (Jackson, \nJ.)). \nThe Nonprofits have a strong likelihood of proving that the funding freezes \nconstitute final agency action for precisely the reasons they spell out.  The decisions \nto issue the Unleashing Guidance (for OMB and the NEC Director) and to pause all \nIIJA and IRA funding (for Energy, EPA, Interior, HUD, and USDA) indeed mark the \n“consummation” of each agency’s decision-making process.  603 U.S. at 808.  That is \nbecause, as the Nonprofits put it, “there are no further steps the agencies need to take \nto determine whether they will freeze that funding,” or, with OMB and the NEC \nDirector, to order them to do so.  (ECF No. 26 at 13.)  And “legal consequences” surely \nflow, given that grant recipients cannot access previously awarded funds.  Id. \nA breadth of caselaw supports this conclusion.  See Louisiana v. Biden, 622 \nF. Supp. 3d 267, 291–92 (W.D. La. 2022) (collecting more than a dozen cases where \ntemporary stops and pauses constituted final agency action for APA purposes).  As \ndoes an emerging consensus of district courts recently hearing cases about different \naspects of federal funding freezes.  See, e.g., New York, 2025 WL 715621, at *8–*9 \n(D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025) (finding that “the implementation of those IIJA and IRA funding \npauses likely marked the consummation of each agency’s decision to comply with the \nUnleashing EO, the Unleashing Guidance, or both”); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 \nWL 597959, at *13 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (finding that the OMB Pause Memorandum \nconstituted final agency action). \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 38 of 63 PageID #:\n687\n \nNor is it clear that the pause is the unreviewable type of agency decision \n“committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  Decisions about \nappropriated but not-yet-awarded funds likely fall into that bucket.  See Lincoln v. \nVigil,  508  U.S.  182,  192  (1993)  (“The  allocation  of  funds  from  a  lump-sum \nappropriation is another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed \nto agency discretion.”)  But this case is different: because the funds at issue here were \nalready  awarded  to  the  Nonprofits,  more  obligations  apply.   See, e.g.,  2  C.F.R. \n§§ 200.300–200.346. \nThen-Judge Jackson’s decision in Policy & Research, LLC, shows why.  After \nnoting that many funding decisions are “presumptively unreviewable,” she explained \nthat there were two caveats: \nCongress can, of course, circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources \nthrough  its  statutory  provisions.    What  is  more,  agencies  themselves \nfrequently cabin their own discretionary funding determinations by generating \nformal regulations or other binding policies that provide meaningful standards \nfor a court to employ when reviewing agency decisions under the APA. \nPol’y & Rsch., LLC, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 76 (cleaned up).  The decision ultimately held \nthat the Department of Health and Human Services, in suddenly halting funds to a \nlongstanding project, “violated the APA, because it failed to explain its reasoning and \nacted contrary to its regulations when it terminated the Plaintiffs’ grants.”  Id. at 83 \n(cleaned up).  This case closely tracks that one—the main difference being, instead of \none program’s termination, that the Government’s actions here involve summarily, \nindefinitely freezing already-awarded money affecting many more. \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 39 of 63 PageID #:\n688\n \nHaving held that the Nonprofits are likely to establish that the funding freeze \nconstitutes a “final agency action” under the APA and seeing no other threshold flaws \nwith their APA claims, the Court moves to the merits. \n2.  Count I: “Arbitrary and capricious” claim \nThe Nonprofits first assert that the funding freeze was unlawfully arbitrary \nand capricious.  The APA requires reviewing courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  An agency action is arbitrary or \ncapricious “if it is not reasonable and reasonably explained.”  Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. \n279, 292 (2024).  The Court cannot “substitute its judgment for that of the agency,” \nbut  it  must  take  care  to  “ensure”  that  the  agency  has  “offered  a  satisfactory \nexplanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.”  Id.  (cleaned up).  And “an agency cannot simply ignore an \nimportant aspect of the problem.”  Id.  (cleaned up). \nThe  Nonprofits  make  a  host  of  arguments  explaining  why  the  freeze  is \narbitrary and capricious, but they can be boiled down to six main points.  First, the \nfunding freeze is “likely substantively unreasonable” because it arises “seemingly for \nno reason other than hostility to the statutes at issue.”  (ECF No. 26 at 15–16.)  \nSecond, even if it were reasonable, it was never “reasonably explained,” because “none \nof the Defendant Agencies has ever offered an adequate explanation for their actions.”  \nId.  at 16–17.    Their  public  statements  lack  reasoning  and  do  not  explain  how \n“intentional blanket freezes on funding that Congress appropriated for specific ends \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 40 of 63 PageID #:\n689\n \nthat  it  judged  important  could  possibly  improve  the  agencies’  alignment  with \ncongressional authorization.”  Id. at 17. \nThird, the Nonprofits separately argue that there is a disconnect between the \nUnleashing EO and the broad agency actions here.  Id. at 17–19.  “Very little—if \nany—IRA and IIJA appropriations contravene” the goals stated in the Unleashing \nEO, and “significant portions actively further those goals,” so a blanket freeze on all \nIRA and IIJA funds is unlawfully overinclusive.  Id. at 18.  Fourth, the Agencies failed \nto consider the practical consequences of the freeze, showing a lack of reasoned \ndecision-making.    Id.  at 19–20.    Fifth,  they  also  failed  to  consider  reasonable \nalternatives  and  provide  a  reasoned  explanation  for  why  they  rejected  the \nalternatives, another indicium of a dearth of reasoned decision-making.  Id. at 20.  \nSixth and finally, the freezes improperly failed to account for the Nonprofits’ “weighty \nreliance interests in receiving already awarded funds.”  Id. at 20–22.   \nThe Government responds with a host of its own points.  First is that arbitrary \nand capricious review is inappropriate.  That is so, the Government argues, for three \nreasons:  because  the  Nonprofits’  claims  are  an  “amorphous,  broad-based \nprogrammatic  attack”  impossible  to  adequately  review,  because  review  would \nimproperly constitute “a backdoor attempt to obtain arbitrary and capricious review” \nof the Unleashing EO itself, and because without knowing which agency actions are \nchallenged, the Government cannot “raise all possible defenses.”  (ECF No. 31 at 49–\n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 41 of 63 PageID #:\n690\n \n50.)7  And even if arbitrary and capricious review were appropriate, the Government \nargues that the freeze was not arbitrary, because “it is perfectly rational to pause \nfunding pending a further determination whether to continue that funding or redirect \nit elsewhere.”  Id. at 50–55. \nThe Nonprofits have made a strong showing that the funding freeze was \narbitrary  and  capricious.    “In  arbitrary  and  capricious  cases,  we  distinguish \nsubstantive  unreasonableness  claims  from  lack-of-reasoned-explanation  claims.”  \nMulticultural Media, Telecom & Internet Council v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 873 \nF.3d 932, 936 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Kavanaugh, J.).  “A substantive unreasonableness \nclaim  ordinarily  is  an  argument  that,  given  the  facts,  the  agency  exercised  its \ndiscretion unreasonably,” and a “decision that the agency’s action was substantively \nunreasonable  generally  means  that,  on  remand,  the  agency  must  exercise  its \ndiscretion differently and reach a different bottom-line decision.”  Id.  Meanwhile, “a \nlack-of-reasoned-explanation  claim  in  this  context  ordinarily  consists  of  a  more \nmodest claim that the agency has failed to adequately address all of the relevant \nfactors or to adequately explain its exercise of discretion in light of the information \nbefore it.”  Id. \nThe Court begins with the “more modest claim” that the Agencies’ funding \nfreezes were not reasonably explained.  Id.  A decision is not reasonably explained if, \namong  other  things,  “the  agency  has  relied  on  factors  which  Congress  has  not \n \n7 For the same reasons previously described in Part III.B.1, these arguments are \nunavailing. \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 42 of 63 PageID #:\n691\n \nintended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, \noffered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the \nproduct of agency expertise.”  Melone v.

The \nstarting place is the reasoning that the agencies employed in executing the freeze.  \nAfter all, “it is well-established that an agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on \nthe basis articulated by the agency itself.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Court finds that the Government failed to provide a rational reason that \nthe need to “safeguard valuable taxpayer resources” justifies a sweeping pause of all \nalready-awarded IIJA and IRA funds with such short notice.  Again, the New York \nCourt’s analysis is instructive: \nRather than taking a deliberate, thoughtful approach to finding these alleged \nunsubstantiated  “wasteful  or  fraudulent  expenditures,”  the  Defendants \nabruptly froze billions of dollars of federal funding for an indefinite period.  It \nis difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision—let alone thoughtful \nconsideration of practical consequences. \n \n2025 WL 715621, at *12 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025).  And “the desire to review programs \nfor efficiency or consistency” does not “have a rational connection to the directives to \nproceed with a sudden, blanket suspension of congressionally appropriated aid.”  Aids \nVaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. CV 25-00400 (AHA), 2025 WL 752378, \nat *10 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025). \nTo be clear: there is “nothing inherently arbitrary and capricious” about an \nagency conducting a review of its spending under the IIJA and the IRA and trying to \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 43 of 63 PageID #:\n692\n \nroot out waste, fraud, or excess.  Id.  “But these assertions alone do not provide a \nrational explanation for why such a review required an immediate and wholesale \nsuspension” of all funding for an indefinite period.  Id.  Nor do those assertions “bear \non the failure to consider the reliance interests of small and large” organizations “that \nwould have to shutter programs or close altogether and furlough or lay off swaths of \nAmericans in the process.”  Id. \nAnd the Government cannot just rest on the Unleashing EO as its justification.  \nThat is true for at least two reasons.  First, the Nonprofits persuasively argue that \nthe  Agencies’  actions  were  overbroad  based  on  the  Unleashing  EO’s  text  and \nsubsequent guidance.8  (ECF No. 21 ¶¶ 34–35.)  After all, M-25-11 states that the \nfreeze “only applies to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities that may be \nimplicated by the policy established in section 2 of the order.”  (ECF No. 21-1.)  \nFurther, for “the purposes of implementing section 7 of the Order, funds supporting \nthe ‘Green New Deal’ refer to any appropriations for objectives that contravene the \npolicies established in section 2.”  Id.  In freezing any and all funding already awarded \nunder  the  IIJA  and  the  IRA,  the  Agencies  failed  to  explain  why  all  those \nappropriations “contravene the policies established in section 2.”  Id. \n \n8 The Court disagrees with the Government that this argument is “foreclosed to \nPlaintiffs” just because “the EO specifically states that it does not create any private \nright of enforcement.”  (ECF No. 31 at 54.)  True, it does not, but it does not need to \nfor the Nonprofits to argue that the fit between the EO and subsequent agency action \nwas “arbitrary and capricious.”  That is what the APA sets out to do.  The result of \nthe Government’ alterative theory is that agencies can do whatever they please in \nservice of an EO, even if the agency’s action is otherwise arbitrary and capricious. \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 44 of 63 PageID #:\n693\n \nThe second reason is equally important: an agency cannot avert the “arbitrary \nand capricious” analysis by simply deferring to the relevant EO.  After all, “furthering \nthe President’s wishes cannot be a blank check” for the Agencies to do as they please.  \nNat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 368852, at *11 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).  “The APA \nrequires a rational connection between the facts, the agency’s rationale, and the \nultimate decision.”  Id.  Here, there is none. \nThe Government also ignored significant reliance interests.  “When an agency \nsuddenly changes course, it must recognize ‘that longstanding policies may have \nengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020).  And here, the \nGovernment “entirely failed to do so.” 9  Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, \nat *15 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025).  Nothing from OMB, the NEC Director, or the five \nAgency Defendants shows that they considered the consequences of their broad, \nindefinite freezes: projects halted, staff laid off, goodwill tarnished.  See infra Part \nIII.C.  Instead, they “essentially adopted a ‘freeze first, ask questions later’ approach.”  \nNat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, at *15. \n \n9 The Government suggests that “the Administration reached a policy judgment that \nsafeguarding taxpayer dollars was a higher priority than providing uninterrupted \nfunding to the IRA and IIJA recipients.”  (ECF No. 31 at 52.)  Fair enough, but that \ndoes not entitle agencies to do anything and everything in furtherance of it.  None of \nthe Defendant Agencies explained much at all, despite the “foundational principle of \nadministrative law” that judicial review of agency action is limited to “the grounds \nthat the agency invoked when it took the action.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 591 U.S. \nat 20. \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 45 of 63 PageID #:\n694\n \nHaving found no rational connection between the sweeping actions taken and \nthe vague justifications proffered, the Court holds that the Nonprofits have a strong \nlikelihood  of  success  on  their  arbitrary  and  capricious  claims  against  all  the \nDefendants.  The Nonprofits have made a strong showing that the seven actions here \nwere neither “reasonable” nor “reasonably explained,” two independent reasons that \nthey were arbitrary and capricious.  Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. at 292.  Separately, the \nCourt holds that the Nonprofits have shown a strong likelihood of success on their \ntheory that the Defendants’ failure to consider reliance interests led to an arbitrary \nand capricious action.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 591 U.S. at 30.  Given that the Court \nhas identified three strong “arbitrary and capricious” theories, it need go no further \non the question.   \n3.  Count II: “Exceeds statutory authority” claim \nThe Nonprofits’ second APA claim is that the Government’s funding freeze was \n“in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,”  under  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(C).  (ECF No. 21 ¶¶ 89, 92–93.)  More specifically, the Agency Defendants \n“lack statutory authority to broadly halt the disbursement of funding appropriated \nby the IRA and IIJA.”  (ECF No. 26 at 22–24.)  And the OMB and Director Hassett \nlack statutory authority “to direct agencies to freeze these funds (or to achieve the \nsame result by withholding purportedly necessary approvals to the disbursement of \nfunds …).”  Id. at 23.  This exercise of “sweeping and unprecedented” power is \nespecially problematic, the Nonprofits insist, because of the major questions doctrine.  \nId. at 24. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 46 of 63 PageID #:\n695\n \nThe Government responds that “each of the IRA and IIJA grant programs \nidentified  by  Plaintiffs  affords  the  relevant  Defendant  agency  with  significant \ndiscretion over allocating funding among eligible recipients.”  (ECF No. 31 at 38.)  \nAnd the Nonprofits, in turn, fail to identify “any statutory language requiring that \nDefendants fund their particular programs, let alone that Defendants do so on any \nparticular timeline.”  Id.  Finally, the Government suggests that there “is no need for \nthe Court to search for a statute specifically authorizing Defendants to pause funding \nand redirect it to a different recipient,” because the authority to do so “is implicit in \nthe grant programs and appropriations laws themselves.”  (ECF No. 31 at 45.)   \nThe Government’s last point is actually the starting point for the analysis.  It \nis well-established that an agency “literally has no power to act—including under its \nregulations—unless and until Congress authorizes it to do so by statute.”  FEC v. \nCruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022).  And “where the statute at issue is one that confers \nauthority upon an administrative agency, that inquiry must be shaped, at least in \nsome measure, by the nature of the question presented—whether Congress in fact \nmeant to confer the power the agency has asserted.”  W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. \n697, 721 (2022).  It is probably true that, as the Government suggests, that the \ngreater power to administer the funds includes some lesser power to pause individual \ngrants.   \nBut the power that the Agency Defendants have actually asserted is a much \nbroader one.  It is not to pause individual, already-awarded funds for failure to comply \nwith a grant agreement or because of a change in policy, but rather to freeze any \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 47 of 63 PageID #:\n696\n \naccess to all already-awarded funds under two statutes indefinitely, based solely on \nthe fact that the funds came from those two statutes.  ECF No. 21-2 at 2; ECF No. 32-\n4 ¶ 8.  In doing so, the Defendant Agencies have summarily tied up a significant \nsubset of the billions of dollars already awarded under those acts. \nThe Court cannot see how they can claim that power.  “We expect Congress to \nspeak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and \npolitical significance.”  Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (cleaned \nup).  And based on the Supreme Court’s past applications of the “major questions \ndoctrine,” this case seems to involve similarly vast questions.  See Ala. Ass’n of \nRealtors v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021) (applying the \ndoctrine where the CDC implemented a nationwide eviction moratorium affecting up \nto 17 million tenants); NFIB. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117–18 (2022) (applying the \ndoctrine  where  OSHA  required  all  federal  employees  to  obtain  COVID-19 \nvaccinations). \nThe Government seems to recognize that they lack the power to pause all IIJA \nand IRA funding at once.  It argues, at another point in its brief, that determining \n“whether a pause on disbursement is lawful necessarily requires examining the \nunderlying statutes governing a program, the appropriations measures providing \nfunding for the program, and potentially the specific terms and conditions included \nin the grant agreement for that program.”  (ECF No. 31 at 24.)  From that premise, \nthe Government suggests that the Court needs to “evaluate the specifics of each \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 48 of 63 PageID #:\n697\n \nalleged withholding, which cannot be done in the abstract or in an across-the-board \nmanner.”  Id. \nBut  what  the  Government  says  the  Court  cannot  do  is  exactly  what  the \nAgencies did here.  Each froze all available IIJA and IRA funding that it administers \n“in the abstract” and “in an across-the-board manner,” just based on the fundings’ \norigins in the IIJA and the IRA.  Id.  If the Court must evaluate the specifics of each \nwithholding to determine its lawfulness, it follows naturally that the Agencies likely \nexceeded their statutory authority in freezing them in totality, without regard to that \nsame analysis.  Because there is no clear statutory hook for this broad assertion of \npower, the Nonprofits are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim against the five \nAgency Defendants.10 \nThe “major questions” case against OMB and Director Hassett is even more \nstraightforward.  See Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, at *16 (applying \nthe doctrine to OMB Memo M-25-13).  The Government hardly seems to resist it.  \nOMB’s  organic  statute  is  31  U.S.C.  § 503.    Under  subsection  (a)(2),  OMB  may \n“[p]rovide  overall  direction  and  leadership  to  the  executive  branch  on  financial \nmanagement  matters  by  establishing  financial  management  policies  and \nrequirements.”  Id. § 503(a)(2).  But providing overall direction and establishing \nfinancial management policies do not clearly confer the power to halt all funding \n \n10 The Government’s two other arguments about broad threshold discretion and \nfunding timelines are irrelevant.  The Court is not requiring the Government to do \nanything over than maintain their current obligations or, alternatively, pause or \nterminate them in an individualized way consistent with law. \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 49 of 63 PageID #:\n698\n \narising from the IIJA and IRA, full-stop, on a moment’s notice and to create a new \npre-clearance regime centered around OMB.  Indeed, the structure and provisions of \nSection 503 strongly suggest that OMB occupies an oversight role.  Neither appears \nto  grant  the  expansive  authority  that  OMB  tried  to  exercise  here,  and  the \nGovernment has not pointed to specific authority that allows it to unilaterally pull \nthe plug on nearly all federal monetary flows under the IIJA and the IRA.   \nSubsection (a)(5) further indicates that OMB’s role is mainly supervisory, \nrather than directly active.  That subsection permits OMB to “monitor the financial \nexecution of the budget in relation to actual expenditures.”  Id. § 503(a)(5).  The \nlanguage falls well short of actively deciding whether agencies “must temporarily \npause” all federal financial assistance.  The Government cannot convincingly argue \nthat “monitor” rises to that level of affirmative control described in M-25-11.  See \nMonitor, The Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (defining “monitor” as “to \nobserve, supervise, or keep under review”).11 \nThe  scope  of  power  that  OMB  and  Director  Hassett  seek  to  claim  is \n“breathtaking,” and its ramifications are massive: an indefinite pause of all money \nawarded under two of the largest spending statutes that Congress has passed in \nrecent memory.  See Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at 764.  Because there is no clear \n \n11 The Government did not identify any statutory authority for the NEC Director to \nissue M-25-11, but elsewhere in its brief recognizes that its office was “not statutorily \ncreated” and its “sole function is to advise and assist the president.”  (ECF No. 31 \nat 17 n.2.)  Given the NEC Director’s attempt to assert direct power over the Agencies \nhere, a step far beyond advising or assisting the president, the major questions case \nagainst the NEC Director is even clearer.   \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 50 of 63 PageID #:\n699\n \nstatutory hook for this broad assertion of power, the Nonprofits are likely to succeed \non the merits of this claim against OMB and Director Hassett. \n4.  Count III: “Contrary to law” claim \n  Finally,  the  Nonprofits  argue  that  the  Government’s  funding  freeze  was \ncontrary to law, in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  (ECF No. 26 at 25.)  They argue \nthat the funding freeze was contrary to the IRA and the IIJA, “to the statutes \ngoverning programs that are funded by the IRA and the IIJA, and to Defendants’ own \nregulations governing the administration of federal grants.”  Id.  \nBut having found that the Nonprofits have shown a likelihood of success on \ntwo of their three claims, the Court declines to analyze the third claim for purposes \nof resolving this motion for preliminary relief.  See Worthley, 652 F. Supp. 3d at 215. \nC.  Irreparable injury \nLikelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  is  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for  a \npreliminary injunction.  Proof of irreparable harm “constitutes a necessary threshold \nshowing,” too.  Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 162 \n(1st Cir. 2004).  “The burden of demonstrating that a denial of interim relief is likely \nto cause irreparable harm rests squarely upon the movant.”  Id.  “A finding of \nirreparable harm must be grounded on something more than conjecture, surmise, or \na party’s unsubstantiated fears of what the future may have in store.”  Id.  It “most \noften exists where a party has no adequate remedy at law.”  Id.  Put differently, “the \nnecessary concomitant of irreparable harm is the inadequacy of traditional legal \nremedies.  The two are flip sides of the same coin: if money damages will fully \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 51 of 63 PageID #:\n700\n \nalleviate harm, then the harm cannot be said to be irreparable.”  K-Mart Corp. v. \nOriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 914 (1st Cir. 1989).  And the Court has “broad \ndiscretion to evaluate the irreparability of alleged harm and to make determinations \nregarding the propriety of injunctive relief.”  Id. \n  The Nonprofits offer five forms of irreparable harm: (1) reducing hiring, (2) \nfurloughing and laying off staff, (3) shuttering planned projects, (4) curtailing or \nending current projects, and (5) incalculable damage to the relationship between the \nNonprofits and the communities they serve.  (ECF No. 26 at 29–35.)   \nThe Government offers three responses.  First, “even if the temporary pause \nmight hypothetically result in a delay in Plaintiffs’ ability to perform certain work \nunder the grant, Plaintiffs have not proven that it would undermine their grant work \nas a whole.”  (ECF No. 31 at 56.)  Second, the harms are “speculative” because the \nGovernment retains “the undisputed authority to terminate Plaintiffs’ grants under \ntheir own authorities.”  Id. at 56–57.  Finally, “even if Plaintiffs can claim some threat \nof harm, there is no reason why they cannot vindicate that threatened harm through \nindividualized, specific lawsuits challenging particular funding denials.”  Id.  at 57. \nThe Nonprofits have more than adequately demonstrated irreparable harm.  \nLike the States in New York, the Nonprofits “laid out scores of examples of obligated \nfunding and the harm that withholding such funding has caused.”  New York, 2025 \nWL 715621, at *13 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025).  The court’s analysis there is on-point and \nbears repeating: \nIt is so obvious that it almost need not be stated that when money is obligated \nand  therefore  expected  (particularly  money  that  has  been  spent  and \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 52 of 63 PageID #:\n701\n \nreimbursement is sought) and is not paid as promised, harm follows—debt is \nincurred, debt is unpaid . . . services stop, and budgets are upended.  And when \nthere  is  no  end  in  sight  to  the  Defendants’  funding  freeze,  that  harm  is \namplified because those served by the expected but frozen funds have no idea \nwhen the promised monies will flow again. \nId. \nA few examples show the myriad irreparable harms.12  First, “new obstacles,” \nlike work stoppages arising from indefinite funding pauses, that “unquestionably \nmake it more difficult” for the Nonprofits to “accomplish their primary mission[s]” \nare a form of irreparable harm.  League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  One grantee’s testimony is illustrative: over 8,300 \nhours of planning wasted on invasive management projects “that just won’t happen \nnow,” another 10,000 hours of work for a Mississippi Park project down the drain, \nand the looming threat of terminating employees’ service terms.  (ECF No. 26-10 \n¶¶ 6–10.)  Or consider CLAP, whose work in fighting childhood lead exposure has \nbeen significantly disrupted.  The challenges arising from the funding freeze “have \nresulted in a delay in the progress” that CLAP “reasonably expected to make towards \nimproving lead hazard awareness, increasing local compliance with lead safety rules, \nand ultimately preventing childhood lead exposure during recent months.”  (ECF \nNo. 26-7 ¶ 28.)  And even if CLAP’s access “to grant funding is fully restored today, \nas an organization and a community, we can never get this time back.”  Id. \n \n12 The harms described above the line are only a sample.  More examples are available \nin the record and the Nonprofits’ briefing.  See, e.g., ECF No. 26-4 ¶ 11; ECF No. 26-\n10 ¶¶ 7–9; ECF No. 26-11 ¶¶ 14, 21; ECF No. 26-9 ¶¶ 17–18, 20; ECF No. 26-6 ¶¶ 15–\n18; ECF No. 26-5 ¶¶ 15, 17, 20; ECF No. 26-12 ¶¶ 7, 20–22; ECF No. 26-3 ¶¶ 12–13; \nECF No. 26-13 ¶¶ 6, 11–12, 15. \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 53 of 63 PageID #:\n702\n \nThe record also shows that the critical pauses in the Nonprofits’ work has \ncaused issues for which “there can be no do over and no redress.” Newby, 838 F.3d \nat 9.  One NCN members’ postponement of a planned project monitoring bark beetle \nattacks on vulnerable, “irreplaceable” giant sequoia trees will lead to environmental \nharms clearly not redressable in the long-run.  (ECF No. 26-9 ¶ 7 (“We can’t afford to \nlose  any  more  of  these  trees:  every  single  one  matters.”)).    And  again,  CLAP’s \ntestimony shows how delays in its work leave no window for a do-over.  “Childhood \nlead exposure can cause permanent damage in a single-day, and only gets worse the \nlonger  it  continues.”    (ECF  No. 26-7  ¶ 24.)    But  because  of  the  freeze  and  the \nsubsequent effects on CLAP’s ability to work with community partners, “lead-safe \nrepairs on local homes” in Providence will likely be “delayed.”  Id. ¶ 26.   \nFinally,  the  Nonprofits’  standing  in  the  communities  that  they  serve  has \nsuffered.  By “its very nature injury to goodwill and reputation is not easily measured \nor  fully  compensable  in  damages,”  so  this  “kind  of  harm  is  often  held  to  be \nirreparable.”  Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc., v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 20 (1st \nCir. 1996); see also HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 326 (4th Cir. 2021) (finding a \n“significant  and  irreparable”  injury  where,  even  if  an  organization’s  affiliates \nsurvived, “the community connections they have developed are likely to erode”); see \nalso K-Mart Corp., 875 F.2d at 915 (noting that “harm to goodwill, like harm to \nreputation,” is not readily measurable and thus likely to be found irreparable). \nThe uncertainty surrounding the pause has caused these harms.  For example, \nGIC’s work helping Choctaw Indians in Mississippi with their forests has been \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 54 of 63 PageID #:\n703\n \ndisturbed.  ECF No. 26-5 ¶ 22 (“We had multiple meetings with the tribe and tribal \ncouncil in the process of getting an agreement drafted to show we were serious and \nwould be helping with them in coming years to manage their forest.  And now we \ncan’t follow through.  If you think about America’s history with the tribes—it was \nhard  to  overcome.    And  then  at  the  eleventh  hour,  we  disappear.    That  whole \nrelationship and the trust we built won’t recover if this continues.”).  Other similar \nexamples are clear from the record.  See, e.g., ECF No. 26-6 ¶¶ 14–16.   \nOn  the  other  side  of  the  ledger,  the  Government’s  arguments  against \nirreparable harm are unconvincing.  The Nonprofits have shown how the pauses \nundermine their grant work “as a whole,” mainly because of the wasted hours of labor \nand planning, the impending loss of staff, and the harms that the pauses have done \nto the Nonprofits’ relationship with their communities.  As for the Government’s \nother arguments, the Court need not delve into whether and how the Government \nretains the authority to end the termination agreements, because that question is not \nbefore it.  But conducting an individualized termination under federal regulations is \nworlds  away  from  the  sudden,  indefinite,  across-the-board,  and  likely  unlawful \nfreezes that happened here. \nAnd again, the U.S. Supreme Court’s reasoning in its recent California stay \norder is not to the contrary.  In staying the TRO, the majority relied on the fact that \nthe state challengers “represented in this litigation that they have the financial \nwherewithal to keep their programs running” without the terminated federal grants.  \nCalifornia, 145 S.Ct. at 969.   \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 55 of 63 PageID #:\n704\n \nHere, the opposite is true.  The Nonprofits have represented that they largely \nlack “the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running” without the grants.  \n(ECF No. 38 at 2–3.)  One grantee member of the NCN made clear that if funding \n“from the IRA and BIL gets held up, the consequences” for it “could be devastating,” \nbecause federal funds make up more than one-third of their 2025 budget and more \nthan 90% of their regional partnership’s funding.  (ECF No. 26-6 ¶ 17.)  Without the \nfunding, the group “would have to let go of most of our shared staff and cancel \ncontracts with local businesses.”  Id.  Another, writing in mid-March, stated that they \nwere “in a crisis,” because they were “45 days away from having to lay off staff at this \npoint,” and the “only reason it’s not sooner is thanks to what little reserve we have \nand the fact that Rhode Island and South Carolina have continued to pay us for work, \neven while they themselves still can’t draw on their federal grants.”  (ECF No. 26-5 \n¶ 18.)  \nSo the Nonprofits have adequately demonstrated irreparable harm arising \nfrom the Government’s actions here.   \nD.  Balance of the equities and the public interest \nAs with irreparable harm, the balance of the equities and the public interest \nweigh heavily in favor of injunctive relief.  The Nonprofits were left adrift as they \nscrambled to make sense of the Government’s actions here.  The pause placed critical \nclimate,  housing,  and  infrastructure  projects  in  serious  jeopardy,  while  also \nthreatening the livelihoods of the Nonprofits’ employees as well as their fundamental \nmissions.  See supra, Part III.C.   \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 56 of 63 PageID #:\n705\n \n  The Government is not harmed where an order requires them to disburse funds \nthat Congress has appropriated and that Agencies have already awarded.  The \nCourt’s order does not prevent the Government from making funding decisions in \nspecific cases according to processes like those established in 2 C.F.R. § 200.340; it \nsimply enjoins sweeping agency action that was likely arbitrary and capricious and \nin excess of statutory authority.  And an agency is not harmed by an order prohibiting \nit from violating the law.   \nOn the other hand, without injunctive relief to pause the categorical freeze of \nIIJA and IRA funds, the funding that the Nonprofits are owed (based on the Agencies’ \nown past commitments) creates an indefinite limbo.  While some funding has begun \nto flow, the Nonprofits continue to face substantial uncertainty about whether the \nGovernment will comply with federal law.  The public interest lies in maintaining the \nstatus quo and enjoining any categorical funding freeze.   \nE.  Bond \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) states that the court may issue a TRO or \npreliminary injunction “only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court \nconsiders proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have \nbeen wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  The Government asks the Court to require \nthe Nonprofits to “provide as security a bond commensurate with the dollar value of \ngrant funds required to be released by any preliminary injunction the Court may \nenter.”  (ECF No. 31 at 63–64.)  The Court declines.  \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 57 of 63 PageID #:\n706\n \nRule 65(c) “has been read to vest broad discretion in the district court to \ndetermine the appropriate amount of an injunction bond,” DSE, Inc. v. United States, \n169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), “including the discretion to require no bond at all,” \nP.J.E.S. ex rel. Escobar Francisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. 3d 492, 520 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(internal quotation omitted).  A bond “is not necessary where requiring [one] would \nhave the effect of denying the plaintiffs their right to judicial review of administrative \naction.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Morton, 337 F. Supp. 167, 168 (D.D.C. 1971) \n(collecting cases); cf.  Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, \nNo. 25-CV-333, 2025 WL 573764, at *30 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025) (setting a nominal \nbond of zero dollars because granting the defendants’ request “would essentially \nforestall [the] [p]laintiffs’ access to judicial review”).  In a case where the Government \nis alleged to have unlawfully withheld large sums of previously committed funds to \nnumerous recipients, it would defy logic—and contravene the very basis of this \nopinion—to hold the Nonprofits hostage for the resulting harm. \nF.  Scope of the remedy  \nHaving decided that the Nonprofits have made the requisite showing under \nthe four-factor test for a preliminary injunction, the Court must next decide the \ninjunction’s scope.  The Nonprofits argue that this is a case where a nationwide \ninjunction is “not only appropriate, but necessary,” for three reasons.  (ECF No. 26 \nat 37.)  First, the relief could not so easily be limited to the Nonprofits here, and it \nwould require more work for the Government “to somehow identify which funding \nstreams were going to NCN members.”  Id.  Second, there are similarly situated \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 58 of 63 PageID #:\n707\n \nnonparties harmed just like the Nonprofits here.  Id. at 38.  Third, the nature of this \ncase, a successful APA challenge, favors broad relief: vacatur of the rule and its \napplicability to all who would have been subject to it.  Id.   \n  The Government responds first that there is “no basis” for extending relief to \nnonparties or funding streams “for which Plaintiffs have not shown harm.”  (ECF \nNo. 31 at 59.)  Second, it posits that 7 U.S.C. § 705 does not require the broad remedy \nthat the Nonprofits seek, in large part because it only requires the Court to “postpone \nthe effective date of an agency action,” and that cannot be done here because the \nagency action has happened.  Id. at 60–61.  Third, the order should be narrow to \nmitigate “the significant harms it would cause to Defendants and to the Executive \nBranch’s abilities to exercise their lawful statutory authority and discretion.”  Id. \nat 61–62. \nWhile federal district courts have issued nationwide or “universal” injunctions \nand they have been acknowledged by the Circuit courts, the Supreme Court has not \ndirectly addressed the issue despite concerns expressed by some justices over their \nuse.   See Trump v. Hawaii,  585  U.S.  667,  713  (2018)  (Thomas,  J.,  concurring) \n(expressing skepticism); Dep’t. of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 \n(2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nBut there are appropriate circumstances during which nationwide injunctions \nare not only appropriate, but necessary.  Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n19 F.4th 1271, 1281–82 (11th Cir. 2021).  Those include the need “to protect similarly \nsituated  nonparties,”  to  “avoid  the  ‘chaos  and  confusion’  of  a  patchwork  of \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 59 of 63 PageID #:\n708\n \ninjunctions,” or “where the plaintiffs are dispersed throughout the United States.”  \nId. (cleaned up).  To this end, in drafting equitable relief, courts must consider “what \nis necessary, what is fair, and what is workable.”  North Carolina v. Covington, 581 \nU.S. 486, 488 (2017). \nAfter finding that the Government’s sweeping actions were likely unlawful, the \nCourt cannot see why similarly situated nonparties should remain subject to them.  \nSee Massachusetts, 2025 WL 702163, at *33 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025).  Nonparties in \nexactly the same circumstances should not be forced to suffer the harms just because \nthere was not enough time or resources for them to join the suit.  “[N]ationwide \ninjunctions provide a mechanism for courts to protect all those who could be harmed \nby a federal policy when only a few have the ability to quickly bring their case before \na court.”  Amanda Frost, In Defense of Nationwide Injunctions, 93 N.Y.U. L. Rev. \n1065, 1094–95 (2018) (“Nationwide injunctions are at times the only way to prevent \nirreparable injury to individuals who cannot easily or quickly join in litigation.”).  \nAfter all, as the Supreme Court has explained, “one of the ‘principles of equity \njurisprudence’ is that ‘the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the \nviolation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.’” Rodgers \nv. Bryant, 942 F.3d 451, 458 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. \n682, 702 (1979)). \nMoreover, the nature of the action itself supports a nationwide injunction.  The \nnormal  remedy  for  a  successful  APA  challenge  is  vacatur  of  the  rule  and  its \napplicability to all who would have been subject to it.  Victim Rts. L. Ctr. v. Cardona, \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 60 of 63 PageID #:\n709\n \n20-CV-11104-WGY, 2021 WL 3516475, at *1 (D. Mass. Aug. 10, 2021) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) (“The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action ... \nfound to be ... arbitrary [and] capricious ....”)); William Baude et al., The Federal \nCourts and the Federal System 1354  (8th  ed.  2025)  (describing  how  the  APA’s \nproviding “for the vacatur of federal agency action may confer” a power analogous to \nuniversal injunction “by statute”); see also Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir. \n1998) (finding that vacation and remand is appropriate when an agency has failed to \ngive adequate explanation for its conclusions); Nw. Env’t Advocs. v. EPA, 537 F.3d \n1006, 1026 (9th Cir. 2008) (“We affirm the district court’s decision to vacate the \nregulation and to remand for further proceedings as a valid exercise of its remedial \npowers.”); Lovely v. FEC, 307 F. Supp. 2d 294, 301 (D. Mass. 2004) (“[V]acation is a \nproper  remedy  when  an  agency  fails  to  explain  its  reasoning  adequately.” \n(quoting Harrington v. Chao, 280 F.3d 50, 60 (1st Cir. 2002) (cleaned up)). \nPut differently, it would be anathema to reasonable jurisprudence that only \nthe named Nonprofits should be protected from the irreparable harms of the likely \nunlawful agency actions.  That is because “when a reviewing court determines that \nagency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—\nnot that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.” Nat’l Min. Ass’n \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (cleaned up).  So \nconsidering the likelihood of success on the merits as to these APA claims, the nature \nof this case favors a nationwide injunction. \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 45     Filed 04/15/25     Page 61 of 63 PageID #:\n710\n \nIV.

Defendants here have specifically targeted funding appropriated by \ntwo laws passed during the prior presidential administration: the Inflation Reduction \nAct and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan \nInfrastructure Law. They have implemented broad, non-individualized freezes of \nfunds  appropriated  by  those  laws,  and  in  doing  so,  have  acted  arbitrarily, \ncapriciously, without statutory authority, and contrary to law, in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. The result of Defendants’ unlawful funding freeze has \nbeen real and irreparable harm to the recipients of that funding in this District and \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 3 of 33 PageID #:\n108\nacross the country, as well as to the people and communities they serve.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to \n28  U.S.C.  § 1331,  because  this  action  arises  under  federal  law,  specifically  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551, et seq.  \n21.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because at \nleast one Plaintiff resides in this District. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n22.  The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Pub. L. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 \n(2022), is a landmark piece of legislation that aims to fight inflation, expand domestic \nmanufacturing,  lower  energy  costs,  and  reduce  carbon  emissions,  among  other \nnotable goals.  \n23.  Among other things, the IRA authorizes and appropriates billions of \ndollars in funding for grants, loans, and other forms of federal financial assistance in \norder to advance these goals.  \n24.  Those programs are administered by various agencies. The Department \nof Agriculture, for example, administers billions of dollars in IRA funding, including \n$19.5 billion handled by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to help farmers, \nranchers, and other landowners protect natural resources and enhance production, \n$13.2  billion  to  build  electrification  infrastructure,  and  $2.4  billion  to  relieve \n \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 7 of 33 PageID #:\n112\nthousands of distressed direct and guaranteed Farm Service Agency loan borrowers.1 \nAs of January 13, the EPA has awarded $38.4 billion in funds appropriated by the \nIRA, representing 93% of grant funding made available by the law.2 And HUD has \nawarded more than $1.4 billion of IRA grant funding in housing investments under \nthe Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, which protects residents in affordable \nhousing by supporting energy and water efficiency, lowering polluting emissions, \nreducing housing operating and utility costs, and making homes more resilient to \nnatural hazards.3 \n25.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. 117-58, \n135 Stat. 429 (2021), also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL, \nwas enacted and signed into law in November 2021. It too funds a wide variety of \ncritical projects and initiatives that are administered by different agencies. \n26.

On  January  20,  2025,  President  Trump  signed  an  executive  order \nentitled Unleashing American Energy, Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353. \nThat order laid out, in Section 2, a nine-part “policy of the United States”: \na.  “to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands \nand waters”; \nb.  “to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of \nnon-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals”; \nc.  “to protect the United States’s economic and national security and \nmilitary preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of \nreliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory”; \nd.  “to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are \ngrounded in clearly applicable law”; \ne.  “to eliminate the ‘electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true \nconsumer choice”; \nf.  “to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a \nvariety  of  goods  and  appliances,  including  but  not  limited  to \nlightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water \nheaters,  toilets,  and  shower  heads,  and  to  promote  market \ncompetition  and  innovation  within  the  manufacturing  and \nappliance industries”; \n \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 10 of 33 PageID #:\n115\ng.  “to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action \nshall,  whenever  evaluated,  be  reported  separately  from  its \ndomestic costs and benefits”; \nh.  “to  guarantee  that  all  executive  departments  and  agencies \n(agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, \npeer-reviewed scientific analysis”; and \ni.  “to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner \ncontrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required \nby law.” \n29.  In Section 7, entitled “Terminating the Green New Deal,” the executive \norder  states:  “All  agencies  shall  immediately  pause  the  disbursement  of  funds \nappropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the \nInfrastructure  Investment  and  Jobs  Act  (Public  Law  117-58),  including  but  not \nlimited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations . . . and shall review their \nprocesses,  policies,  and  programs  for  issuing  grants,  loans,  contracts,  or  other \nfinancial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and \nthe policy outlined in section 2 of this order.” \n30.  Section 7 further provides: “No funds identified in this subsection (a) \nshall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the \nPresident  for  Economic  Policy  have  determined  that  such  disbursements  are \nconsistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt.” \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 11 of 33 PageID #:\n116\n31.  OMB adopted such review recommendations the next day, issuing a \n“Memorandum  to  the  Heads  of  Departments  and  Agencies”  numbered  M-25-11. \nEx. A.  The  subject  line:  “Guidance  Regarding  Section  7  of  the  Executive  Order \nUnleashing American Energy.” The memo was from Matthew J. Vaeth, the then-\nacting  director  of  OMB,  and  Kevin  Hassett,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for \nEconomic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council. \n32.  The memo stated: “The directive in section 7 of the Executive Order \nentitled  Unleashing  American  Energy  requires  agencies  to  immediately  pause \ndisbursement of funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public \nLaw 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58). \nThis pause only applies to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities that may \nbe implicated by the policy established in Section 2 of the order. This interpretation \nis consistent with section 7’s heading (‘Terminating the Green New Deal’) and its \nreference to the ‘law and the policy outlined in section 2 of th[e] order’” (alteration in \noriginal). \n33.  The memo continued: “For the purposes of implementing section 7 of the \nOrder,  funds  supporting  the  ‘Green  New  Deal’  refer  to  any  appropriations  for \nobjectives that contravene the policies established in section 2. Agency heads may \ndisburse  funds  as  they  deem  necessary  after  consulting  with  the  Office  of \nManagement and Budget.” \n34.  OMB  has  limited  statutory  authority  to  establish  governmentwide \nfinancial  management  policies  for  executive  agencies  and  to  provide  them  with \n \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 12 of 33 PageID #:\n117\nguidance on financial management matters. 31 U.S.C. § 503(a). OMB lacks statutory \nauthority to direct executive agencies to undertake a blanket freeze of even a subset \nof funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. Cf. Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, \nNo. 1:25-cv-239, 2025 WL 597959, at *15 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (finding that OMB \nlikely  lacked  statutory  authority  to  direct  broad  halts  of  federal  funding  and \nexplaining that OMB’s statutory responsibilities to “provid[e] overall direction and \nestablishing financial management policies do not clearly confer the power to halt all \nfinances, full-stop, on a moment’s notice”). \nDefendants Have Broadly Frozen Funds Appropriated by the IRA and IIJA \n35.  Since the Unleashing American Energy order, Defendants have broadly \nfrozen funding appropriated under the IRA and IIJA. They have halted payment of \nthese funds—and halted other activities related to the payment of these funds, such \nas failing to take steps necessary to finalize the obligation of awarded grants and \nmaintaining access to online portals through which grantees can draw on open \nawards—en masse and on a non-individualized basis. \n36.  In doing so, numerous agencies have said outright what they were doing \nand why. \n37.  For example, at EPA, on January 27, the acting chief financial officer \nsent a memorandum entitled “Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment \nand Jobs Act Funding Pause.” Ex. B at 1. The memo—which, it explained, was “being \nprovided  based  on  instruction  from  OMB—stated  that  “all  disbursements  for \nunliquidated  obligations  funded  by  any  line  of  accounting  including  funds \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 13 of 33 PageID #:\n118\nappropriated by the [IRA and IIJA] are paused.” Id. Likewise, “[i]n accordance with \nthe  Executive  Order  Unleashing  American  Energy,  unobligated  funds  (including \nunobligated  commitments)  appropriated by  the  [IRA  and  IIJA]  are  paused.”  Id. \nAccording to the memo, “[t]his pause will allow for the review of processes, policies \nand programs as required by Section 7 of the Order.” The memo further explains that \n“[a] process has been established at OMB for their review and approval of obligations \nand disbursements based on the Order.” Id. at 2.8 \n38.  EPA officials have acted accordingly to carry out the freeze on IRA and \nIIJA-appropriated funds. Officials sent grant recipients an e-mail on January 28 with \nthe subject “Pause EPA Grants.” That e-mail stated: “Dear Grant Recipient, EPA is \nworking diligently to implement President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy \nExecutive Order issued on January 20 in coordination with the Office of Management \nand Budget. The agency has paused all funding actions related to the Inflation \nReduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at this time. EPA is \ncontinuing to work with OMB as they review processes, policies, and programs, as \nrequired by the Executive Order.” Ex. C. \n39.  In  a  subsequent  memo  (undated,  but  issued  after  February  3), \nEPA’s acting  deputy  administrator  described  “EPA’s  mission  and  our  moral \n \n8 On February 4, EPA’s CFO issued an “Update on Inflation Reduction Act and \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Pause” in response to court orders in other \ncases, directing that “federal financial assistance shall not be paused based on . . . \nthe President’s Executive Orders, while ongoing litigation proceeds or until \notherwise directed by a Court.” Ex. D at 1. Nonetheless, as alleged below, EPA has \ncontinued to freeze payments on IRA and IIJA funds. In any event, the court order \nto which that update referred has since expired. \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 14 of 33 PageID #:\n119\nresponsibility to be good stewards of our environment for generations to come.” Ex. E \nat 1. Expressing concerns about “the need for oversight of funds provided to [EPA] in \nthe Inflation Reduction Act,” and “potential waste, fraud, and abuse of hard-earned \nAmerican taxpayer dollars,” the memo directs EPA to “immediately initiate and \nconduct an internal review of all relevant grant programs, grant awards, grants that \nhave  not  yet  been  awarded  and  obligated  to  specific  individuals  or  entities \n(e.g., notices of funding opportunities), and issued grants.” Id. at 1–2. “This includes \na review of payments on all grant programs and awards where Agency personnel \nsuspect that the grant is unlawful or contrary to Agency policy priorities, or suspect \nthat the grant program implementation or payment might be fraudulent, abusive, \nduplicative, or implemented in a way that failed to safeguard Agency dollars.” Id. \nat 2.  \n40.  On February 7, EPA’s Budget and Planning e-mail address sent an e-\nmail with the subject: “RE: Additional information on IIJA and IRA - program review \npause.”9 The e-mail stated: “Pursuant to the review of financial assistance programs \nannounced by the Acting Deputy Administrator on February 6, the following accounts \nare  temporarily  paused  for  new  obligations  or  disbursements  for  assistance \nagreements,  loans,  rebates,  interagency  agreements,  procurements,  and  no-cost \nactions pending a review for compliance with applicable administrative rules and \npolicies.” \n \n9 Brad Johnson, Trump EPA Again Freezes All Biden-Era Programs, Hill Heat \n(Feb. 10, 2025), https://perma.cc/4CAN-3U52. \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 15 of 33 PageID #:\n120\n41.  As reflected in a March 7 letter from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse to \nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has recently informed senior staff that “all \n[funding] actions greater than $50,000 now require approval from an EPA DOGE \nTeam member.” See Ex. F. This process requires the program office to complete and \nsign an “EO Compliance Review Form” for every funding action to facilitate that \nreview. Id. That form requires an explanation of how the funding action “complies \nwith Executive Order requirements.” Id. at 6. These actions are consistent with the \n“freeze first, ask questions later” approach Defendants have adopted to releasing \nfunding.   \n42.  The Department of the Interior initiated a review of funding under the \nIRA and IIJA following the Unleashing American Energy executive order,10 and has \n“frozen billions in grants and loans stemming from those two bills” pending that \nreview.11 As one example, the National Park Service, a component of Interior, has \nrefused to release funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. In communications with \ngrant recipients, the National Park Service has stated  that “NPS FA [financial \nassistance] agreements that include BIL or IRA funding” will remain frozen.12 As a \n \n10 Sec’y of the Interior, Order No. 3418, Unleashing American Energy (Feb. 3, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/6CUZ-A89U. \n11 Austin Corona, Will Trump Review Lead to Smaller Monuments, More Mines on \nPublic Lands?

G at 1 (email from Department of the Interior grant officer referring \na grantee to OMB Memo M-25-11 “regarding the funding pause”). \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 16 of 33 PageID #:\n121\nresult, members of Plaintiff NCN and others have been unable to access funds on \nopen grants administered by the Department of the Interior. \n43.  The Department of Agriculture has likewise broadly frozen IRA and \nIIJA funding following the Unleashing American Energy executive order. Only on \nFebruary 20 did it announce that “the first tranche of funding that was paused due \nto the review of funding in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)” would be released—a \nmere $20 million out of the many billions of dollars in IRA funding that the agency \nadministers.13 That statement acknowledges both the agency’s broad freeze of IRA \nfunding and the immense scope of USDA funding that remains under a blanket \nfreeze. In short, the announcement confirms Plaintiff NCN’s members’ experiences \nthat USDA is taking precisely the “freeze first, ask questions later” tactic that they \nchallenge.  \n44.  Indeed, Agriculture grant recipients have received e-mails explicitly \nlinking the freeze to recent executive orders, including Unleashing American Energy, \nand stating that “USDA leaders have been directed to assess whether grants, loans, \ncontracts, and other disbursements align with the new administration's policies.” \nEx. H. This is consistent with reporting that IRA grant recipients under USDA were \n“shut out of the federal grant portal that is used to distribute money.”14 The USDA \n \n13 Press Release, Dep’t of Agric., Secretary Rollins Releases the First Tranche of \nFunding Under Review (Feb. 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/UD67-F97T.  \n14 Jeremy Herbet al., ‘People Are Just Flipping Out’: Billions in Federal Funding \nRemain Frozen Despite Court Orders to Keep the Taps Open, CNN (Feb. 13, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/PHT3-GAJQ. \n \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 17 of 33 PageID #:\n122\nhas given no indication that any further “tranches” of funding have been released \nfrom the blanket freeze. \n45.  This blanket freeze has affected numerous programs at Agriculture. For \nexample, the IRA provides $1.5 billion in funding for the Urban and Community \nForestry Program. Pub. L. 117-169, § 23003(a), 136 Stat. 1818, 2026 (2022). That \nprogram is administered by the U.S. Forest Service, a component of the Department \nof Agriculture. The Urban and Community Forestry Program provides grants to \nsupport efforts by states and partner organizations to plant and maintain community \ntrees, forests, and green spaces, including in disadvantaged areas. Because of the \nfreeze, Plaintiffs WRWC and GIC, other members of Plaintiff NCN, and countless \nothers have been unable to access funds on open grants through that program.  \n46.  As another example, the IRA appropriates nearly $5 billion in funding \nuntil  fiscal  year  2026  for  the  Regional  Conservation  Partnership  Program. \nPub. L. 117-169,  §  21001(a)(4).  That  program  is  administered  by  the  Natural \nResource Conservation Service, a component of the Department of Agriculture. The \nRegional  Conservation  Partnership  Program  provides  funding  for  public-private \nconservation projects by landowners and communities. In an email to program grant \nrecipients dated March 11, NRCS stated that it would begin to authorize payments \non existing grants “except for IRA/BIL funded agreements.” As a result, members of \nPlaintiff NCN and others have been unable to access funds on open grants through \nthat program. \n \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 18 of 33 PageID #:\n123\n47.  As to the Department of Energy, the then-Acting Secretary announced \non January 20 that the agency would conduct a review of all its activities—specifically \nincluding “Funding Actions” such as actions relating to “loans, loan guarantees, [and] \ngrants”—“to  ensure  all  such  actions  are  consistent  with  current  Administration \npolicies and priorities, including budgetary priorities.” Ex. I at 1-2.  \n48.  Reporting indicates that IRA grant recipients under Energy were “shut \nout of the federal grant portal that is used to distribute money.”15 Reporting has also \nrevealed that the Department of Energy froze grants related to the IRA and IIJA, \nultimately  requiring  review  and  approval  by  a  political  appointee  before \ndisbursement.16 As that reporting explains, because there are “easily thousands of \ntransactions a week that a political appointee would suddenly now have to approve,” \npayments from these funding lines “just won’t get made or may be made late.” Supra \nnote 15.    \n49.  As  one  example  of  the  effect  of  that  freeze:  The  IIJA  appropriates \n$3.5 billion in funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program. Pub. L. 117-58, \n§ 40551,  135  Stat.  448,  1075-76  (2021).  That  program  is  administered  by  the \nDepartment of Energy and enables low-income families to permanently reduce their \nenergy bills by making their households more energy efficient. As a result of the \nfreeze, members of Plaintiff NCN and others have been unable to access funds on \nopen grants through that program. \n \n15 Jean Chemnick, Effects of Trump’s Spending Freeze Ripple Across Energy \nProjects, Politico (Feb. 6, 2025), https://perma.cc/NCT2-9AYS. \n16 Id. \n \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 19 of 33 PageID #:\n124\n50.  HUD, too, has frozen IRA appropriations under its Green and Resilient \nRetrofit program. See supra n.3. HUD has claimed that the program is, in the words \nof one news report, “being reviewed to ensure it was carried out consistent with the \nhousing agency’s core mission to promote affordable housing.” Id.17 But HUD has \ncommunicated  to  grant  recipients  that  the  freeze  was  due  to  the  Unleashing \nAmerican Energy executive order. As a result of this freeze, CSNDC and others have \nbeen unable to access funds on open grants through that program. \n51.  Because of these broad freezes, funding appropriated by the IRA and \nIIJA for particular grant programs has halted. The handful of examples described \nabove are merely evidence of a much wider freeze; Defendants have broadly frozen \nnumerous other sources of funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n52.  On information and belief, OMB has acted in concert with the other \nagency defendants to freeze funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n53.  First, OMB has directed agencies to freeze funds “for objectives that \ncontravene the policies established in section 2” of the Unleashing American Energy \nexecutive order, without legal basis, and without explaining how an agency should \ndetermine what “contravene[s]” those policies. \n \n17 Earlier reporting suggested that HUD was halting this program indefinitely, before \nHUD issued this statement regarding a “review.” See, e.g., Jesse Bedayn, Affordable \nHousing Threatened as Trump Halts $1 Billion Slated for Extending Life of Aging \nBuildings,  Associated  Press  (March  12,  2025),  https://apnews.com/article/trump-\ndoge-affordable-housing-preservation-crisis-de27d7846271779157550fcec0a78ea6. \nWhatever  the  precise  terminology  HUD  employs,  the  impact  is  the  same:  an \nindefinite halt to this congressionally appropriated funding. \n \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 20 of 33 PageID #:\n125\n54.  Second, OMB has directed agencies that they “may disburse funds as \nthey deem necessary after consulting with the Office of Management and Budget.” \nOn information and belief, to the extent that agencies have consulted with OMB \nabout the disbursement of funds they deem necessary, OMB has acted unreasonably \nand without basis in withholding that consent, and requiring the agencies to continue \nwithholding funds. \n55.  Officials  affiliated  with  DOGE  (encompassing  the  Department  of \nGovernment Efficiency, the U.S. DOGE Service, and/or the DOGE Service Temporary \nOrganization) have helped or directed EPA to freeze funding appropriated by the IRA \nand IIJA. On information and belief, officials affiliated with DOGE have done the \nsame at other defendant agencies. DOGE lacks any statutory authority to itself freeze \nthis funding. \nDefendants’ Freezes of These Funding Lines Are Final Agency Action  \n56.  The Administrative Procedure Act authorizes judicial review of final \nagency action. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n57.  Final agency actions are those (1) that “mark the ‘consummation’ of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154, 178 (1997) (quotation marks omitted). \n58.  Each Defendant’s freeze on funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA \nis final agency action subject to the Court’s review.  \n \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 21 of 33 PageID #:\n126\n59.  The  freeze  of  funds  appropriated  by  the  IRA  and  IIJA  marks  the \nconsummation  of  the  agencies’  decisionmaking  process  because  it  immediately \nsuspends the processing and payment of funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n60.  The freeze of funds appropriated by the IRA and IIJA is also an action \nby  which  rights  or  obligations  have  been  determined  or  from  which  legal \nconsequences  will  flow  because  it  halts  the  processing  and  payment  of  funding \nappropriated by the IRA and IIJA that would otherwise be paid. \nPLAINTIFFS’ INJURIES \n \n61.  Defendants’ freeze of funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA has \ncaused, and if not enjoined will continue to cause, serious and irreversible harm to \nPlaintiffs’ members and many others. \n62.  Countless  states,  localities,  businesses,  and  nonprofits—including \nPlaintiffs and other members of NCN—have been awarded grants and other financial \nassistance through the IRA and IIJA. That money funds vital programs ranging from \nwildfire prevention efforts to lead pipe remediation to efforts to control and contain \ninvasive species to important scientific and ecological research to reforestation efforts \nand much more. \n63.  Many of the recipients of such funding—and, in particular, nonprofit \nrecipients such as Plaintiffs and other NCN members—rely on those sources of \nfunding in order to hire and pay staff, carry out what are frequently multiyear \nprojects for the benefit of the communities where they operate, and plan for the \nfuture. \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 22 of 33 PageID #:\n127\n64.  Defendants’  freeze  has  already  seriously  damaged  those  nonprofits’ \nability to carry out their core missions and led them to have to halt ongoing projects.  \n65.  For example, WRWC has a $1 million grant (as a subgrantee) funded by \nthe U.S. Forest Service—but it has been frozen since January because the grant was \nfunded under the IRA. That freeze has completely halted WRWC’s planned project of \nbuilding capacity for urban forestry along the Woonasquatucket Greenway, and also \ndisrupted WRWC’s operations more broadly. \n66.  ERICD has a nearly $350,000 grant from EPA (as a subgrantee) that is \nfunded under the IRA. Those funds were intended to support education and outreach \nefforts to reduce food waste and its negative impacts on the environment, including \nsetting up the first municipal composting site in Rhode Island. But because ERICD’s \ngrant has been frozen on and off for weeks, it hasn’t been able to carry out the work \nit planned. ERICD is also a subgrantee of a USDA grant funded by the IRA—and \nthat grant has remained completely frozen since January. ERICD planned to use that \nmoney to hire another full-time staff person to help farmers use technology and data \nto grow more efficiently and sustainably. But because of the freeze, ERICD has not \nbeen able to hire that staff person, and so fewer farmers receive help.  \n67.  CLAP is unable to access a critical $500,000 grant administered by the \nEPA  that  it  needs  in  order  to  carry  out  an initiative  to  combat  childhood  lead \npoisoning in Providence, Rhode Island. That initiative was to include trainings for \ncontractors and other workers on lead-safe practices that are needed to keep those \nworkers healthy and to avoid contaminating the homes in which they work with lead \n \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 23 of 33 PageID #:\n128\nparticles. CLAP also intends to use the grant to fund efforts to coordinate local and \nstate officials to ensure landlords are operating in compliance with lead-safety laws. \nCLAP is a small organization that lacks the resources to carry out these projects on \nanything like the same scale if their already awarded EPA grant remains frozen. \nAlready, they have had to defer hiring an extra staff member because of the freeze. \nAs a result, CLAP has been significantly hampered in its ability to carry out its vital \nmission, to the detriment of CLAP itself and the community it serves.  \n68.  CSNDC has been awarded a $750,000 grant from HUD, funded under \nthe IRA. CSNDC has planned to use these funds to rehab and renovate a thirty-one-\nunit affordable housing unit for older residents, including upgrading ventilation \nsystems  and  better  weatherizing  the  units  to  increase  energy  efficiency.  These \nimprovements will not only help the environment; they will also save CSNDC money \nit  can  then  put  towards  other  initiatives,  and  it  will  improve  air  quality  for \nvulnerable, low-income seniors in an area with high asthma rates. But even though \nthe grant has been awarded, the grant agreement has been fully negotiated, and \nCSNDC has executed the agreement, HUD has refused to take any further steps, \nincluding executing the finalized agreement and disbursing funds—because of the \nfunding freeze. As a result, CSNDC will not be able to complete the project on the \nscale it had planned, losing money for its mission and impacting its senior residents’ \nhealth. \n69.  GIC, one of NCN’s members that operates in Rhode Island and several \nother  states,  receives  both  IRA  and  IIJA  funding.  Those  grants  make  up  fully \n \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 24 of 33 PageID #:\n129\n80 percent of their budget. Their IRA funding comes through the Department of \nAgriculture and goes toward efforts to plant and maintain community trees, forests, \nand green spaces, including in disadvantaged areas.  \n70.  GIC has had to stop work as a result of the Department of Agriculture’s \nfreeze on funding. They hired new staff specifically to complete IRA-funded work but \nnow have had to furlough some staff and, if the funds remain frozen, will need to lay \noff not only their new hires but the rest of their staff as well. They have been unable \nto plan for the future and do not know, for example, whether they will have the money \nto pay for trees they need to order now to have ready for planting seasons in the fall. \nThey worked hard to build trust in communities that are frequently skeptical of \ngovernment programs in order to be able to successfully carry out long-term projects; \nthe freeze has shattered that trust. \n71.  Another NCN member carries out research and conservation work to \nprotect giant sequoias and other large trees. They rely on funds from both the IRA \nand IIJA from the Department of Interior. Because of Defendants’ funding freeze, \nthey  have  been  unable  to  draw  on  IRA-appropriated  funds  through  a  grant \nsupporting work to research and monitor bark beetles that can infest and kill giant \nsequoia trees.  \n72.  If the freeze continues, the group is likely to have to postpone the project \nuntil next year, even as bark beetles are currently in the process of attacking ancient \ntrees  that  cannot  be  replaced.  Halting  that  data  collection  will  have  cascading \nimpacts on their scientific progress as well. And because of the funding freeze, the \n \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 25 of 33 PageID #:\n130\ngroup has already had to postpone hiring a new full-time employee to add to their \nstaff of four, as well as hiring up to six part-time contractors. Not being able to add \nthat extra capacity has a meaningful impact on the amount of work the group is able \nto do to fulfill its mission. \n73.  Another  NCN  member  is  dedicated  to  watershed  protection  and \nrestoration in a Western state. They too receive funds appropriated under the IRA \nand IIJA for a number of different projects but have seen funds administered by the \nDepartment of Agriculture frozen as a result of Defendants’ actions.  \n74.  That freeze has already put on hold a land-management project to clear \nvegetation in order to reduce the risk of wildfires and improve habitat and water \nquality in the area. Keeping that project on ice increases the danger of wildfires this \nsummer and threatens local water quality. It is also already hurting the group. They \nhired new staff in reliance on a grant of IRA funds they cannot currently access. As a \nresult, they do not know how much longer they will be able to continue paying their \nnew employee or when their work might resume. \n75.  Yet another NCN member, which engages hundreds of youth and young \nadults in programs to improve access to outdoor recreation, restore natural habitats, \nprotect waterways, and respond to community needs and natural disasters, has \napproximately $621,000 in federal grants from Interior frozen.   \n76.  As a result, that organization can no longer use those funds as planned \nto support an invasive plant management team that would work with national parks \nin the central United States. That will result in potentially thousands of acres not \n \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 26 of 33 PageID #:\n131\nbeing managed, with negative impacts for visitors to public lands, hunting and \nfishing, and wildlife populations due to loss of habitat. And the organization cannot \nmake up for that delay: If they are ever able to manage these invasive species in the \nfuture, it will be more difficult and more expensive because they will have spread \nmore.  \n77.  And yet another NCN member runs a weatherization training center, \nwhich helps weatherize the homes of low-income Americans in an effort to lower their \nutility bills when they are struggling to make ends meet, which helps them stay in \ntheir homes and also improves air quality and health and safety in the home. That \nmember typically trains over 200 people in about 40 classes per year. But the funding \nfor that weatherization program comes entirely from IIJA funds awarded by the \nDepartment of Energy, and those funds have been frozen since January. \n78.  As  a  result,  that  member  has  had  to  stop  offering  weatherization \ntraining, which means that people living in poverty are less safe in their homes and \nless able to make ends meet. Because of the funding freeze, that member has also had \nto pause all work on a two-year program to gain expertise in offering training to \nweatherization departments, which would ultimately  enable them to weatherize \nmore homes. And the member has had to cancel a planned conference, undermining \ntheir relationships with speakers and attendees from their community. \n79.  These stories are just a few examples of a much broader picture of \ninstability, confusion, and irreparable harm created by Defendants’ actions.  \n \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 27 of 33 PageID #:\n132\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—706(2)(A) \nArbitrary and Capricious  \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n80.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n81.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n. . . found to be arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n82.  Defendants’ freeze on funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA is \narbitrary and capricious in multiple respects. Several examples follow. \n83.  First, Defendants’ funding freeze fails to account for the catastrophic \npractical consequences that it has already produced and, if not stopped, will continue \nto produce. In this and other respects, Defendants “entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem.” See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n84.  Second, Defendants’ funding freeze fails to account for the substantial \nreliance interests in the ordinary processing and disbursement of funding authorized \nby the IRA and IIJA that the freeze radically disrupts. “When an agency changes \ncourse . . . it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered \nserious reliance interests that must be taken into account,’’ and the failure to do so is \narbitrary and capricious. DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n85.  Third, Defendants’ funding freeze contradicts Defendant OMB’s own \ndirective. That directive instructs agencies that the order to pause funding in the \n \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 28 of 33 PageID #:\n133\nUnleashing American Energy executive order does not apply to all funding authorized \nby the IRA and IIJA but only “to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities \nthat  may  be  implicated  by  the  policy  established  in  Section  2  of  the  order.” \nDefendants, however, have continued to pause funding authorized by the IRA and \nIIJA well outside that scope. By freezing funding without reason and in contravention \nof the administration’s own interpretation of the executive order, Defendants have \nacted arbitrarily and capriciously. \n86.  Defendants  Department  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Energy, \nDepartment of the Interior, Department of Housing and Urban Development, EPA, \nand  their  leaders  have  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  by  halting  funding \nappropriated by the IRA and IIJA.  \n87.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendants \nOMB, Director Vought, and Director Hassert have acted arbitrarily and capriciously \nby withholding purportedly necessary approvals to the other Defendants to release \nfunding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA.  \nCount Two \nAdministrative Procedure Act–706(2)(C) \nIn Excess of Statutory Authority \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n88.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n89.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n. . . found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 29 of 33 PageID #:\n134\n90.  “An  agency  .  .  .  literally  has  no  power  to  act—including  under  its \nregulations—unless and until Congress authorizes it to do so by statute.” FEC v. \nCruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n91.  No  statutory  provision  authorizes  Defendants  Department  of \nAgriculture, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, or EPA to freeze \nfunding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n92.  Defendants  Department  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Energy, \nDepartment of the Interior, Department of Housing and Urban Development, EPA, \nand their leaders therefore have acted in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right in withholding those funds. \n93.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendants \nOMB,  Director  Vought,  and  Director  Hassett  have  acted  in  excess  of  statutory \nauthority by withholding purportedly necessary approvals to the other Defendants to \nrelease funding authorized by the IRA and IIJA. \n94.  OMB’s organic statute gives it responsibilities for establishing financial \nmanagement  policies  and  requirements  for  executive  agencies,  see  31  U.S.C. \n§§ 503(a), 504, which can include providing guidance to agencies on understanding \nexecutive orders. \n95.  But  no  statutory  provision  authorizes  OMB,  Director  Vought,  or \nDirector Hassett to require executive agencies to freeze funding authorized by the \nIRA and IIJA.  \n \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 30 of 33 PageID #:\n135\nCount Three \nAdministrative Procedure Act–706(2)(A) \nContrary to Law \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n96.   Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n97.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n. . . found to be . . . not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n98.  The APA’s reference to “law” in the phrase “not in accordance with law,” \n“means, of course, any law, and not merely those laws that the agency itself is charged \nwith administering.” FCC v. NextWave Pers. Commc’ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) \n(emphasis in original). \n99.  The IRA and IIJA appropriate money for specific purposes and expressly \ndirect that the money be put to those purposes.  \n100.  By freezing funds appropriated under the IRA and IIJA and refusing to \ndirect that money to the purposes Congress specified in those laws, Defendants are \nacting contrary to law. \n101.  The regulations that govern the administration of grants by Defendants \nDepartment  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Energy,  Department  of  the  Interior, \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, and EPA set out specific conditions \nand procedures for terminating and suspending grants. \n102.  Defendants have not followed the procedures set out in those governing \nregulations and have frozen grants in circumstances in which the regulations would \nnot allow those grants to be terminated or suspended. By doing so, Defendants are \nacting contrary to law. \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 21     Filed 03/17/25     Page 31 of 33 PageID #:\n136\n103.

Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ freeze on funding appropriated \nby the IRA and IIJA as arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion under \n5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(A),  in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), and not \nin accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \nb.  For the same reasons, declare and hold unlawful OMB Memo M-25-11 \ninsofar as it directs agencies to freeze any funding authorized by the IRA \nand IIJA; \nc.  Issue preliminary and permanent relief, including a stay under 5 U.S.C.  \n§ 705,  barring  Defendants,  their  officers,  employees,  and  agents  from \ncontinuing to carry out the freeze on funding appropriated by the IRA and \nIIJA and requiring the processing and disbursement of funding previously \nfrozen; \nd.

In a subsequent \ntext order, the Court ordered status reports due by 12:00 p.m. noon on Friday, May 2.  \nBelow, the Court highlights issues that the parties should address in those reports. \nI.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT \nAt  last  Friday’s  conference,  the  parties  raised  no  issues  about  HUD’s \ncompliance.  Based on its review of the record, the Court does not see any outstanding \nissues with HUD’s compliance, but it welcomes any updates from the parties. \nII.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY \nAt last Friday’s conference, the parties also raised no issues about Energy’s \ncompliance.  Based on its review of the record, the Court does not see any outstanding \nissues with Energy’s compliance, but it welcomes any updates from the parties. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 58     Filed 04/28/25     Page 2 of 5 PageID #:\n1076\nIII.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR \nInterior has identified 650 IIJA or IRA grants, “representing nearly half a \nbillion dollars,” that have been unpaused as of April 25.  (ECF No. 56-1 ¶ 9.)  An \nofficial stated that Interior “continues to work expeditiously with its other bureaus \nand offices to confirm the status of any IIJA/IRA funds that they administer.”  Id. \n¶ 10.  And Interior estimates that its “diligence efforts,” as well as its efforts to comply \nwith notice requirements, will be finished by this Friday, May 2.  Id. ¶ 11. \nThe  Court  directs  the  Government  to  provide  an  additional  declaration \naccompanying its status report, explaining Interior’s progress with compliance since \nthe last conference.  \nIV.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  \nUSDA has identified “at least 42,627 unique grants, cooperative agreements, \ndirect loans, or other financial assistance transactions funded by either IRA or IIJA.”  \n(ECF No. 56-2 ¶ 16.)  According to a USDA official, 309 awards “remain frozen \nbecause they were individually reviewed and identified as inconsistent with the \nSecretary’s priorities on DEI,” and all 309 were reviewed before the Court’s April 15 \norder and frozen “on an individualized basis for an independent reason” apart from \nthe fact that they were IRA or IIJA grants.  Id.  At the conference, the Government \nstated that Paragraphs 15 and 17 show that all other identified IRA and IIJA \nawards—as in, everything but those 309 grants—were unfrozen.  The Nonprofits and \nthe Court were not as certain.  The Court directed the Government to clarify in its \nnext status report. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 58     Filed 04/28/25     Page 3 of 5 PageID #:\n1077\nThe Nonprofits raised two more issues.  First was a statement from a USDA \nofficial stating that “IRA-funded RCPP projects that do not yet have an executed \nagreement . . . in place should remain paused.”  (ECF No. 55-1 at 2.)  Comparing the \nUSDA and the Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District’s situation to that of HUD \nand Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation, the Nonprofits noted \nthat the Court’s order extended to the processing of awards.  The Court saw this issue \nas, in part, turning on how USDA interprets the Court’s use of the term “already \nawarded” funding in its order.  See, e.g., ECF No. 45 at 61 ¶¶ 2–3.  The term should \nbe interpreted generously to avoid ambiguity, unnecessary parsing, and efforts to \nevade compliance.  The Court directed the Government to clarify USDA’s position on \nthis situation in its next status report.   \nSecond, the Nonprofits argued that USDA needed to justify its decisions to \nkeep  those  309  grants  frozen  with  “contemporaneous  documentation.”    Noting \nInterior’s affidavit under oath at paragraph 16, the Court declined to establish a \npreclearance regime requiring the Government to prove the lawfulness of every pause \nunder other executive orders.  But the Court recognized that greater detail regarding \nthe process of “individualized review” may be beneficial.   \nAs  discussed,  the  Court  directs  the  Government  to  provide  an  additional \ndeclaration accompanying its status report.  In particular, the declaration should \nclarify how many IIJA and IRA grants (of the 42,627 identified so far) are unfrozen.1  \n \n1 As discussed, the Court’s use of the term “grants” is meant to cover all financial \nawards administered under the statutes.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 58     Filed 04/28/25     Page 4 of 5 PageID #:\n1078\nIt should also address the Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District issue and how \nUSDA  understands  “already-awarded”  grants.    It  should  further  explain  the \n“individualized review” process for keeping those 309 grants frozen.  Finally, it should \nsummarize all progress with compliance since the last conference. \nV.  U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY \nAs explained in a previous affidavit, EPA identified 2,004 active IIJA grants \nand 979 active IRA grants.  (ECF No. 51-1 ¶ 4.)  It also stated that EPA planned to \nterminate about 800 grants, having already noticed 377 grantees and not having \nnoticed approximately 404.  Id. ¶ 5.  EPA has kept these roughly 800 grants paused \nbecause they are “soon-to-be-terminated.”  Id. ¶ 7.  Ahead of last Friday’s conference, \nthe Court directed the parties to address whether those pauses pending terminations \nwere consistent with the preliminary injunction.2  (ECF No. 52 at 6–7.)   \nAfter hearing from the parties on Friday, April 25, the Court ordered these \nfunds  unfrozen  until  they  are  definitively  terminated  consistent  with  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.341(a) and other applicable regulations.  The Court distinguished between \nEPA’s pauses here—seemingly in conflict with 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6) and largely \ngrounded in unsubstantiated concerns of abuse pending termination—and USDA’s \npauses related to DEI programs—seemingly related to other executive orders, the \npropriety of those orders being no issue here.  The Court also declined to open any \n \n2  The  Court  appreciates  the  Government’s  disclosure  and  initial  request  for \nclarification on this issue.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 58     Filed 04/28/25     Page 5 of 5 PageID #:\n1079\ndiscovery into EPA’s “individualized review” process, and it made clear that this \ncase—at least as it presently stands—is about pauses, not terminations. \nSo the Court directs the Government to confirm that all of EPA’s IIJA and IRA \nfunds are unfrozen pending termination in its May 2 status report.  The Government \nshould also detail EPA’s efforts to notice remaining Nonprofits of any impending \nterminations—not  because  the  case  will  become  about  terminations,  but  rather \nbecause the pauses-pending-termination have clearly led to confusion about the scope \nof the Court’s order. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nThe Court directs the parties to address these issues—as well as any other \noutstanding issues regarding compliance—via status reports due Friday, May 2, \nat 12:00 p.m.  At the May 5 status conference, the parties should also be prepared to \ndiscuss the next steps of the case following compliance.  \n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n_________________________________  \nMary S.

Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-97 (MSM) \n   \nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, \net al., \n \n      Defendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \n \nDefendants respectfully request that the Court stay further district court \nproceedings in this case until Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s Order granting \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is resolved, at which point the parties \nshould jointly set forth their views on whether any further proceedings are necessary \nin this case, and if so propose a schedule for such proceedings.  See Notice of Appeal, \nECF No. 62.  As courts of appeals have long recognized, a stay of district court \nproceedings “to await a federal appellate decision that is likely to have a substantial \nor controlling effect on the claims and issues in the stayed case” is “at least a good, if \nnot an excellent” reason to stay proceedings.  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. \nS. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 559 F.3d 1191, 1998 (11th Cir. 2009).  Such a stay would \nnot  prejudice  Plaintiffs  here,  as  they  are  already  protected  by  the  preliminary \ninjunction  order  issued  by  this  Court,  ECF  No.  45  (“PI  Order”).    This  Court’s \ninjunction already provides all the relief the Plaintiffs are seeking, so there is no \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 12 PageID #:\n1303\nlonger any plausible basis for claiming imminent or ongoing irreparable harm to the \nPlaintiffs.  The First Circuit’s forthcoming decisions, both in the appeal of this case \nand in the Government’s appeal of Chief Judge McConnell’s preliminary injunction \norder in the related New York v. Trump case, could potentially resolve this case \nentirely, or at a minimum will provide important guidance on the governing legal \nframework for Plaintiffs’ claims.  See New York v. Trump, No. 25-1236 (1st Cir.); \nWoonasquatucket  River  Watershed  Council  v.  USDA,  No. 25-1428  (1st  Cir.).  \nContinuing forward with district court proceedings now—when the First Circuit will \nsoon provide potentially dispositive rulings, or at least helpful guidance, regarding \nPlaintiffs’ claims—would result in needlessly duplicative litigation and potentially \nsensitive disputes regarding discovery.  A stay of further proceedings, until those \nappellate decisions provide such guidance, would therefore conserve resources of both \nthe Court and the parties, without any cognizable prejudice to Plaintiffs.   \nBACKGROUND \nOn March 13, 2025 Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint in this action.  See \nECF No. 1.  After filing an Amended Complaint on March 17, 2025, see ECF No. 21, \nPlaintiffs  moved  for  a  preliminary  injunction  that  same  day,  see  ECF  No.  26.  \nDefendants opposed Plaintiffs’ motion on various bases including that this Court \nlacks jurisdiction to hear this case, and that Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits or establish irreparable harm.  See ECF No. 31.   \nThe  Court  issued  a  preliminary  injunction  on  April  15,  2025,  enjoining \nDefendants from “freezing, halting, or pausing on a non-individualized basis the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 12 PageID #:\n1304\nprocessing and payment of [already-awarded] funding” that was appropriated under \nthe Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \n(“IIJA”).  ECF No. 45 at 61.  Since that order was issued, the Court has “determined \nthat all agencies were complying” with the Court’s preliminary injunction.  ECF No. \n68 at 1.   \nDefendants appealed the Court’s preliminary injunction on April 30, 2025.  See \nECF  No.  62.    The  First  Circuit’s  consideration  of  Defendants’  appeal  of  the \npreliminary  injunction  remains  ongoing.   See  Woonasquatucket  River  Watershed \nCouncil v. USDA, No. 25-1428 (1st Cir.). \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n“The District Court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to \nits power to control its own docket.”  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997); see \nalso Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Int’l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 77 (1st Cir. 2004) \n(“It is apodictic that federal courts possess the inherent power to stay proceedings for \nprudential reasons.”).  However, “there must be good cause for [a stay’s] issuance; [it] \nmust be reasonable in duration; and the court must ensure that competing equities \nare weighed and balanced.”  Marquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st Cir. 1992).   \nOne good cause for a stay is to respect “the general principle” that federal \ndistrict  courts  should  “avoid  duplicative  litigation.”    Colorado  River  Water \nConservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976); see also Marquis 965 \nF.2d at 1154 (district courts have discretion to stay proceedings in the interest of \n“efficacious management of court dockets”).  Additionally, courts frequently grant \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 12 PageID #:\n1305\nstays when there are ongoing “independent proceedings which bear upon the case,” \nbecause a stay is most “efficient for [the court’s] own docket and the fairest course for \nthe parties[.]”  Leyva v. Certified Grocers of California, Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863 (9th \nCir. 1979); cf. Microfinancial, 385 F.3d at 77 (1st Cir. 2004) (“The pendency of a \nparallel or related criminal proceeding can constitute [ ] a reason [to grant a stay.]”). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  There is Good Cause to Grant a Stay Because It Would Advance \nJudicial Economy and Simplify the Proceedings. \nThe Court’s preliminary injunction is now on appeal before the First Circuit.  \nStaying district court proceedings pending resolution of that appeal makes eminent \nsense because it would support judicial economy and would allow the parties here to \naddress the relevant issues with the benefit of any ruling from the First Circuit. \nGiven that many (if not all) of the critical legal issues presented in Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint are now before the First Circuit, it makes little sense for this Court (and \nthe parties) to expend the resources necessary for a full presentation of those issues \nat this time.  Because the preliminary injunction standard will require the First \nCircuit to consider whether Plaintiffs are “likely to succeed on the merits,” Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), it would be far more efficient for \nthe parties to await a decision from the First Circuit, at which point most (if not all) \nof the legal issues may then have definitive resolution and further briefing and \nconsideration of any remaining legal issues would be better informed by having the \nbenefit of the First Circuit’s analysis.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 12 PageID #:\n1306\nIndeed, if the Court were to deny a stay here, the parties would be required to \nbrief and litigate a motion to dismiss—even though the motion to dismiss would \npresent many of the same legal arguments the Government has asked the First \nCircuit to decide.  That briefing process, and this Court’s consideration of the motion, \nwould itself be wasteful.  Cf. Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of State, 925 F. Supp. 2d \n55, 59 (D.D.C. 2013) (granting a stay “[n]ot needing more lawyers to spend more time \non more briefs on more subjects”).  There can be no question, therefore, that a stay \nwould serve “efficacious management of [the Court’s] docket[],” Marquis, 965 F.2d at \n1154, and simplify the issues and questions of law the Court will need to confront.  \nAnd of course, if the Court were to deny that motion to dismiss, that would only \ncompound  the  burdens  on  the  parties  and  the  Court—requiring  production  of \nAdministrative Records for vaguely defined agency actions, followed by potential \nrequests for further discovery as Plaintiffs have previously suggested, contrary to the \nnormal rule that discovery is impermissible in APA actions.  See generally Camp v. \nPitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973) (“[T]he focal point for judicial review should be the \nadministrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the \nreviewing court.”).  Thus, further proceedings could likely become quite burdensome \nand protracted, all of which would be potentially unnecessary depending on how the \nFirst Circuit rules in the upcoming appeals. \nFor  these  reasons,  district  courts  around  the  country  routinely  stay \nproceedings where resolution of an appeal in the same or a similar matter may guide \nthe district court in deciding issues before it.  See, e.g., Univ. of Colo. Health Mem’l \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 12 PageID #:\n1307\nHosp. v. Burwell, No 14-cv-1220, 2017 WL 535246, at *12 (D.D.C. Feb. 9, 2017) \n(“Because many of the applicable issues may be resolved by the D.C. Circuit, and \nbecause the D.C. Circuit may otherwise provide instruction on the issues here, the \nCourt finds a stay would serve the interests of judicial efficiency.”);  Allina Health \nServs. v. Sebelius, 756 F. Supp. 2d 61, 71 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding “good cause to stay \nthis matter” given that “the parties agree that the resolution of [a related case] by the \nD.C.  Circuit  will  be dispositive  of  the  Plaintiffs’  arguments  here”);  Kunsman  v. \nConkright, No. 08-cv-6080L, 2018 WL 9781177, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. June 25, 2018) \n(staying case pending decision by Court of Appeals, because that decision “will likely \nimpact issues pending in this case” and “if this Court were to rule now in this action, \nwithout the benefit of an appellate ruling . . . it would only result in complicating \nmatters, risking a ruling at odds with [the Court of Appeals], and delaying the \nresolution of this action”); Lincoln Nat’l Life Ins. Co. v. Transamerica Fin. Life Ins. \nCo., No. 1:08-cv-135, 2010 WL 567993, at *1 (N.D. Ind. Feb. 12, 2010) (staying case \nuntil outcome of Supreme Court decision, so as to provide the court with “clear \ndirection on the precise standard to be applied” in evaluating the claims in the case).  \nAs one district court explained: “How the Court of Appeals . . . answers the significant \nlegal questions of this case will likely alter upcoming proceedings.  Thus, staying this \ncase avoids duplicative and potentially unnecessary litigation, conserving judicial \nresources.”  Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, No. A-16-CA-1300-SS, 2017 WL \n5649477, at *2 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 16, 2017).   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 12 PageID #:\n1308\nUnderscoring  the  appropriateness  of  a  stay in  these  circumstances,  Chief \nJudge McConnell recently issued a stay in New York v. Trump, pending resolution of \nthe pending appeal in that case.  See Text Order, New York v. Trump, 25-cv-39 (D.R.I. \nApr. 21, 2025).  Just as Chief Judge McConnell stayed proceedings pending resolution \nof the Government’s appeal of his preliminary injunction order, this Court should \nlikewise stay proceedings pending appeal in this case. \nThe grounds for a stay are also particularly compelling where, as here, the \nhigher court will be considering issues bearing on Article III standing, and the district \ncourt’s jurisdiction to proceed at all.  See Gonzalez de Fuente v. Preferred Home Care \nof New York LLC, No. 18-cv-6749, 2020 WL 738150, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2020) \n(“This is especially true for issues that determine a district court’s jurisdiction to hear \na case under Article III.”); cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 \n(1988) (“The requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter \n‘springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States’ and is \n‘inflexible and without exception.’” (internal quotation omitted)).  A stay of further \nproceedings would allow time for appellate courts to provide further guidance on \nthese jurisdictional issues, thereby avoiding “the challenges of pinning down the \nprecedential effects of emergency decisions,” PI Order at 33–34 n.6 (discussing the \nSupreme Court’s emergency stay order in Department of Education v. California), \nwhile  also  ensuring  further  proceedings  in  this  Court  do  not  transgress  any \njurisdictional boundaries.  Cf. Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 94 (“Without jurisdiction the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 12 PageID #:\n1309\ncourt cannot proceed at all in any cause.”).  Thus, there is ample good cause for \nstaying further proceedings in this case. \nII.  A Stay of Proceedings Pending Appeal Is Fair to the Parties’ \nEquities and Reasonable in Duration. \n \nIn contrast to the significant waste of resources that will occur if this case \nproceeds, Plaintiffs will not suffer any harm from a stay, because this Court has \nalready  issued  a  ruling  which,  among  other  things,  enjoins  Defendants  from \n“freezing,  halting,  or  pausing  on  a  non-individualized  basis  the  processing  and \npayment of [already-awarded] funding” that was appropriated under IRA or IIJA.  \nECF No. 45 at 61.  Because the preliminary injunction will remain in effect while the \nappeal is litigated, there is no basis for concern about any continuing harms allegedly \nstemming from the challenged actions in this case.  See, e.g., Latta v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 653 F. Supp. 3d 435, 440–41 (S.D. Ohio 2023) (no prejudice to plaintiff from \nstay because challenged program “is currently enjoined”); Washington v. Trump, No. \nC17-0141JLR, 2017 WL 1050354, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 17, 2017) (finding that any \nprejudice to plaintiffs from stay would be “minimal—if there is any at all” in light of \nthe preliminary injunctive relief already in effect); Hawai’i, 233 F. Supp. 3d at 853–\n54 (“any prejudice to the State caused by a delay in the instant case will be minimal” \nbecause a “nationwide injunction already provides the State with the comprehensive \nrelief it seeks in this lawsuit”); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., No. 1:15-108-CL, 2015 \nWL 13744253, at *2 (D. Or. Aug. 6, 2015) (“The stay will not harm Plaintiffs because \nthis court has enjoined the proposed merger.”); see also Whitman-Walker Clinic v. \nHHS, No. 20-1650 (JEB), 2021 WL 4033072, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 3, 2021) (finding that \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 9 of 12 PageID #:\n1310\nprejudice to plaintiffs from a stay of proceedings was minimal where the provisions \nof the Rule “that form the heart of Plaintiffs’ objections are currently—and will \nremain—enjoined”).1   \nFinally, Defendants’ proposed stay is of reasonable duration.  For one thing, \nthe appeal in this case could be effectively resolved by the New York v. Trump appeal, \nand briefing on that appeal is scheduled to proceed shortly—with the Government’s \nopening brief and appendix due in just over a week on May 27, 2025, and Plaintiff-\nAppellees’ response brief due 30 days later on June 26, 2025.  See Briefing Schedule \nOrder, New York v. Trump, No. 25-1236 (May 5, 2025).  That appeal involves many \nof the same legal issues as in this case and its resolution would therefore likely \nprovide guidance to this Court, if not entirely dispose of this case.  Indeed, the district \ncourt in New York v. Trump specifically discussed pauses of funding under the IRA \nand IIJA as a central aspect of its analysis, see New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39, \n2025 WL 715621, at *8–12, *14–16 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025), and this Court adopted \nmuch of that reasoning, see PI Order at 28, 37, 42, 51–52.  Furthermore, this Court \nrepeatedly  relied  on  the  First  Circuit’s  stay  decision  in  New  York  v.  Trump in \nrejecting certain threshold APA arguments the Government raised in this case.  See \nid. at 24–25, 27.  This Court also relied on the New York v. Trump district court’s \n \n1  The Court has “determined that all agencies” are “complying” with the \nCourt’s preliminary injunction.  ECF No. 68 at 1.  However, in the event that the \nCourt  grants  this  motion  and  Plaintiffs  later  wish  to  raise  issues  regarding \nDefendants’  compliance  with  the  Court’s  preliminary  injunction,  Defendants \ncontemplate that Plaintiffs would be able to do so without needing to move to lift the \nstay. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 12 PageID #:\n1311\nruling that Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) did not divest \nit of jurisdiction, id. at 35, a ruling that is also on appeal in that case and consolidated \nwith the appeal of the district court’s preliminary injunction order, see ECF No. 185, \nNew York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39 (D.R.I. Apr. 28, 2025); Order, New York v. Trump, \nNo. 25-1236 (1st Cir. May 5, 2025).  Thus, a decision from the First Circuit decision \nin New York v. Trump is likely to provide guidance to this Court in deciding issues in \nthis case, further weighing in favor of a stay, particularly given that the appeal in \nNew York v. Trump is already underway. \nEven if the First Circuit’s ruling in New York v. Trump does not resolve the \nappeal  in  this  case,  the  First  Circuit  will  consider  the  appeal  of  this  Court’s \npreliminary  injunction  in  due  course,2  and,  as  discussed  above,  district  courts \nroutinely stay cases pending resolution of related appeals, regardless of the precise \ntiming of those appeals.  Moreover, there will be no harm to Plaintiffs in the interim, \nwhereas continuing with further proceedings in this Court—at the same time as the \nFirst Circuit is also considering the same issues—would clearly be wasteful.   \nThus, all three factors—good cause, reasonable duration, and fairness to the \nparties—weigh squarely in favor of a stay.  See Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1155. \n \n   \n \n2 Defendants note that, because of the aforementioned significant overlap in \nlegal issues between this case and New York v. Trump, the Government plans to move \nto put the Woonasquatucket appeal in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal in \nNew York v. Trump. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 70     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 12 PageID #:\n1312\nCONCLUSION \nThe Government respectfully requests a stay of district court proceedings \npending resolution of all appeals from this Court’s preliminary injunction, at which \npoint  the  parties  should  jointly  set  forth  their  views  on  whether  any  further \nproceedings  are  necessary  in  this  case,  and  if  so  propose  a  schedule  for  such \nproceedings.   \n \nDated: May 19, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

Defendants seek to stay resolution of this \ncase pending appeal, while simultaneously seeking to stay that very appeal, piling \ndelay upon delay. The Court need not countenance those efforts, which are unlikely \nto promote judicial efficiency and risk real prejudice to Plaintiffs. \nBACKGROUND \nChallenges  to  agency  action  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  are \ntypically resolved based on the administrative record that was before the agency \nwhen it acted. See, e.g., Atieh v. Riordan, 727 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir. 2013) (“The focal \npoint of APA review is the existing administrative record.”); see also Defs.’ Mot. to \nStay at 5 (ECF No. 70). “An administrative record must consist of all documents and \nmaterials  directly  or  indirectly  considered  by  the  agency  decision-makers  and \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 2 of 11 PageID #:\n1315\nincludes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.” Roe v. Mayorkas, No. 22-cv-\n10808, 2024 WL 5198705, at *7 (D. Mass. Oct. 2, 2024) (quotation marks omitted). \nThe  government  bears  responsibility  for  assembling  and  producing  the \nadministrative record. Cf. D.D.C. L. Civ. R. 7(n)(1) (setting deadline by which agency \nmust file with the court an index of the administrative record).  \nIn some circumstances, it is appropriate for the reviewing court to look beyond \nthe administrative record, such as “where there is a failure to explain administrative \naction as to frustrate effective judicial review,” Olsen v. United States, 414 F.3d 144, \n155–56 (1st Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted), or where “additional testimony by \nexperts” would “help [the court] understand matters in the agency record,” Valley \nCitizens for a Safe Env't v. Aldridge, 886 F.2d 458, 460 (1st Cir. 1989) (Breyer, J.). \nBut APA actions often do not require discovery beyond the administrative record, \nparticularly if that record is appropriately compiled. As a result, APA actions are \nfrequently  resolved  on  cross-motions  for  summary  judgment,  see,  e.g.,  Bos. \nRedevelopment Auth. v. Nat’l Park Serv., 838 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 2016) (discussing \nuse of this procedure to decide APA cases), and the government often agrees to \nproceed straight to the provision of an administrative record and cross-motions for \nsummary judgment, skipping over a motion to dismiss in the interests of judicial \nefficiency, see, e.g., Joint Proposed Briefing Schedule, New Orleans Workers’ Ctr. for \nRacial Justice v. Dep’t of Labor, No. 20-cv-1825, Dkt. 11 (D.D.C. Oct. 1, 2020); Joint \nStatus Report, Chicago v. Azar, No. 20-cv-1566, Dkt. 13 (D.D.C. June 22, 2020) \n(agreeing to convert a preliminary injunction motion into cross-motions for summary \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 3 of 11 PageID #:\n1316\njudgment); id. Dkt. 18 (July 20, 2020) (filing motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, \nmotion for summary judgment); cf. Order, New York v. HHS, No. 19-cv-4676, Dkt. \n121 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2019) (setting schedule for production of administrative record \nand contemporaneous briefing on a preliminary injunction motion and cross-motions \nfor summary judgment); Minute Order, Nat’l Women’s Law Ctr. v. OMB, No. 17-cv-\n2458  (D.D.C.  Nov.  15,  2018)  (requiring  government  defendants  to  compile  the \nadministrative record and respond to summary judgment briefing even while motion \nto dismiss remained pending, over government’s objection).1 \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every \ncourt to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and \neffort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Am. Sales Co., LLC v. Warner Chilcott \nPub. Ltd., No. 13-cv-347, 2013 WL 4016925, at *1 (D.R.I. Aug. 6, 2013) (quoting \nLandis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1936)). “However, ‘the suppliant for a \nstay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go \nforward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work \ndamage to some one else.’” Id. (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 255); accord Austin v. \nUnarco Indus., Inc., 705 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1983) (“[T]o be entitled to a stay, a party \nmust demonstrate a clear case of hardship if there is a danger that the stay will \ndamage the other party.”). The moving party bears a “heavy burden” to show that a \n \n1 This procedure seems especially appropriate here, where the Court has already \nconsidered the jurisdictional arguments that Defendants might raise in a motion to \ndismiss when it ruled on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 4 of 11 PageID #:\n1317\nstay is warranted. Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Int’l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 77 \n(1st Cir. 2004).  \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs  oppose  a  stay.  To  begin,  there  appears  to  be  no  dispute  that \nDefendants’ appeal “does not divest [this C]ourt with jurisdiction to proceed with a \ndecision on the merits.” Jack’s Canoes & Kayaks, LLC v. Nat’l Park Serv., 937 F. \nSupp. 2d 18, 26 (D.D.C. 2013); see also Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Maine Atty. Gen., \n332 F. Supp. 2d 258, 259 (D. Me. 2004) (“The general rule for an interlocutory appeal \nof a preliminary injunction is that it ‘does not defeat the power of the trial court to \nproceed  further  with  the  case.’”  (quoting  Wright  &  Miller,  Federal  Practice  & \nProcedure, § 3921.2 (3d ed. 1999))). The Court should do so here. \nThe discretionary choice whether to stay proceedings “calls for the exercise of \njudgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance.” \nLandis, 299 U.S. at 254–55. Where “there is even a fair possibility that the stay . . . \nwill work damage to some one else,” the movant “must make out a clear case of \nhardship  or  inequity  in  being  required  to  go  forward”  before  a  court  will  stay \nproceedings. Id. at 255; see also, e.g., Driver v. Helms, 402 F. Supp. 683, 685–86 (D.R.I. \n1975)  (citing  Landis,  noting  that  a  stay  should  be  granted  “‘only  in  rare \ncircumstances,’” “where the need for the stay clearly outweighs the harm to the \nplaintiffs”); Atlantic Salmon Federation U.S. v. Merimil Ltd. P’ship, No. 21-cv-257, \n2022 WL 951709, at *5 (D. Me. Mar. 30, 2022) (citing Landis and denying stay where \ndefendants argued that they would be prejudiced merely by having to defend the \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 5 of 11 PageID #:\n1318\nlawsuit while also navigating an administrative process); Does 1–6 v. Mills, No. 21-\ncv-242, 2022 WL 43893, at *3 (D. Me. Jan. 4, 2022) (citing Landis and noting that \neven substantial and unrecoupable litigation costs “do not give rise to hardship or \ninequity requiring a stay in proceedings”); Nat’l Indus. for Blind v. Dep’t of Veterans \nAffs., 296 F. Supp. 3d 131, 140 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing Landis, denying stay, and \nemphasizing that “the burden of demonstrating a hardship that warrants staying \nproperly filed legal proceedings is on the movant”) (K.B. Jackson, J.). \nHere,  a  stay  would  undermine,  not  promote,  judicial  efficiency  and  the \nexpeditious  resolution  of  this  case.  First,  Defendants’  arguments  about  judicial \neconomy  fall  flat  in  light  of  their  efforts  to  simultaneously  stay  not  only  the \nproceedings here, but also the appeal in the First Circuit. Waiting for first the New \nYork, and then this, appeal to resolve, may well mean that proceedings do not resume \nin this court until 2027. (The government has not sought to expedite either appeal.) \nThese circumstances are a far cry from a court exercising discretion to stay “when a \nhigher court is close to settling an important issue of law”; for example, where “the \nCourt  of  Appeals  has  already  heard  argument”—as  was  the  case  in  one  of  the \nexamples on which Defendants rely. See Kunsman v. Conkright, No. 08-cv-6080L, \n2018 WL 9781177, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. June 25, 2018) (quoted in Mot. at 6); see also \nDriver, 402 F. Supp. at 685–86 (denying stay where the other case was still in \npreliminary stages).  \nMoreover,  in  the  intervening  years,  this  case  could  well  proceed  to  final \njudgment  if  it  is  not  stayed—obviating  the  need  for  appellate  review  of  the \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 6 of 11 PageID #:\n1319\npreliminary injunction at all. Review of that final judgment, should it be subject to \nappeal, would further promote judicial efficiency by enabling the court of appeals to \npass judgment on a more complete record. See Caribbean Marine Services Co., Inc. v. \nBaldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 673 (9th Cir. 1988) (“We believe that this case could have \nproceeded to trial, or to the summary judgment stage, in less time than it took the \nparties to submit these cases for appeal [on the grant of a preliminary injunction]. \nHad the parties pursued this course, they would have achieved a prompt resolution \nof the merits.”). Defendants’ proposal for extended two-step litigation—in which the \nparties and judiciary must devote a year or more to litigating Plaintiffs’ “likelihood” \nof prevailing before this Court can decide whether Plaintiffs actually prevail—makes \nlittle sense and cannot be justified on efficiency grounds. Perhaps for this reason, \ndistrict  courts  in  this  circuit  have  denied  motions  to  stay  pending  appeals  of \npreliminary injunctions in particular, noting that such a review would not provide a \nbinding decision on the merits. See Russomano v. Novo Nordisk Inc., No. 20-cv-10077, \n2020 WL 2850253, at *2 (D. Mass. June 2, 2020); Pharm. Care, 332 F. Supp. 2d at \n260; see also Caribbean Marine Services, 844 F.2d at 673 (“A preliminary injunction \nis, as its name implies, preliminary to the trial—not to an appeal.”). \nDefendants  rely  heavily  (at  7)  on  Judge  McConnell’s  decision  to  stay \nproceedings in New York pending appeal, suggesting this Court follow the example. \nBut Defendants neglect to mention that their motion for stay in that case was not \nopposed, see No. 25-cv-39, Dkt. 183 (D.R.I. Apr. 17, 2025)—so it is hardly surprising \nthat it was granted.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 7 of 11 PageID #:\n1320\nThe delay Defendants propose here is not only likely to be far lengthier (given \nthat,  if  they  have  their  way,  the appeal itself  will  also  be  stayed),  there  is, at \nminimum, “a fair possibility that the stay . . . will work damage to some one else.” See \nLandis, 299 U.S. at 255. That is because Defendants seek to postpone their obligation \nto produce the administrative record or any other needed factual material for perhaps \nan additional year or more. That would “work damage” to Plaintiffs not only by \nneedlessly delaying their access to that information but by materially increasing the \nrisk that the same information will no longer be available when Defendants finally \nturn to assembling and producing the administrative record sometime in 2026, or \n2027, or beyond. This risk is heightened given that the administrative proceedings \nhere did not take place in the ordinary course and accordingly, the record will require \nassembly by staff with actual knowledge of the decisionmaking process at issue and, \nin particular, what materials were before any relevant agency decisionmakers and \nwhat consideration they gave to the obvious harmful consequences of their actions. \nBy the time two appeals are decided, this court rules on a motion to dismiss (should \nDefendants choose to file one), and Defendants file their answers, memories will have \nfaded, staff may have changed, and documents may be lost. Cf. Pagtalunan v. Galaza, \n291 F.3d 639, 643 (9th Cir. 2002) (“Unnecessary delay inherently increases the risk \nthat witnesses’ memories will fade and evidence will become stale.”); Hall v. Toro, No. \n18-cv-355, 2022 WL 2752621, at *4 (D.R.I. July 14, 2022) (noting, in the context of an \nopen-ended stay, that the court must consider “serious prejudice” to the non-movant, \n“including the fading memories of witnesses”); Katz v. Liberty Power Corp., LLC, No. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 8 of 11 PageID #:\n1321\n18-cv-10506, 2020 WL 3440886, at *4 (D. Mass. June 23, 2020) (recognizing that “a \nprolonged stay can make discovery unnecessarily difficult . . . as relevant employees \nleave and memories fade” (quoting Sutor v. Amerigroup Corp., No. 1:19-cv-1602, 2020 \nWL 2124180, at *2 (E.D. Va. Mar. 10, 2020))). \nDefendants’ own authority notes that this is a salient consideration. In one of \nthe cases they cite (at 6), the district court granting a stay found it “[s]ignificant[]” \nthat “Plaintiffs do not argue any discovery will be inhibited or prevented if this case \nis stayed.” Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 16-cv-1300, 2017 WL 5649477, \nat *2 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 16, 2017). Here, however, the opposite is true. There is “a fair \npossibility,” Landis, 299 U.S. at 255, that the passage of time will degrade the quality \nof the administrative record, harming Plaintiffs’ ultimate ability to litigate the case \non the merits. The possibility of prejudice to Plaintiffs would grow greater still in the \nevent the record is incomplete or otherwise in need of supplementation through \ndiscovery.2 \nBecause there is at minimum a “fair possibility” that a stay would “work \ndamage” to Plaintiffs, the government bears the burden in seeking the stay to “make \nout a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward.” Id. at 255. \nThe government fails to do so. “[B]eing required to defend a suit, without more, does \nnot constitute a ‘clear case of hardship or inequity.’” Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. \nRoss, 419 F. Supp. 3d 16, 21 (D.D.C. 2019); see also Atlantic Salmon, 2022 WL 951709, \n \n2  Of  course,  discovery  in  this  case  is  likely  only  if  the  Court  determines  that \nDefendants have failed to assemble a record sufficient for it to resolve the parties’ \ncross-motions for summary judgment—a possibility that becomes more likely the \nmore time passes. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 9 of 11 PageID #:\n1322\nat *5; Does 1–6, 2022 WL 43893, at *3. And even if ordinary litigation costs were \nrelevant, Defendants have not shown that seeing this case through to final judgment \nat this point would be particularly difficult or impose any special burden.  \nOn this point, the district court’s recent order in National Council of Nonprofits \nv. Office of Management & Budget is instructive. In that case, Defendants OMB and \nDirector Vought sought a stay of further district court proceedings, pending the D.C. \nCircuit’s ruling on the preliminary injunction order. Judge AliKhan ordered that \nDefendants produce an administrative record, and set a schedule by which Plaintiffs \ncould submit requests for additional discovery, while otherwise staying the matter \npending appeal. See Minute Order, No. 25-cv-239 (D.D.C. May 12, 2025). In that case, \nof course, Defendants have not requested a stay of the appeal, so any delay is likely \nto  be  of  shorter  duration.  At  a  minimum,  then,  moving  forward  with  the \nadministrative record and any necessary discovery to protect against the degradation \nof evidence would be equally warranted here. \nCONCLUSION \nFor all these reasons, the Court should deny the motion to stay proceedings. In \nthe alternative, if the Court is inclined to stay proceedings, it should do so only after \nthe parties have finished assembling the record, including completing any necessary \ndiscovery. \n \nDated:  May 22, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Miriam Weizenbaum \n \nMiriam Weizenbaum (RI Bar No. 5182) \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 71     Filed 05/22/25     Page 10 of 11 PageID #:\n1323\nDeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens \n199 North Main Street \nProvidence, RI 02903 \n(401) 453-1500 \nmiriam@dwbrlaw.com \n \nKevin E.

Defendants here have specifically targeted funding appropriated by \ntwo laws passed during the prior presidential administration: the Inflation Reduction \nAct and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan \nInfrastructure Law. They have implemented broad, non-individualized freezes of \nfunds  appropriated  by  those  laws,  and  in  doing  so,  have  acted  arbitrarily, \ncapriciously, without statutory authority, and contrary to law, in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. The result of Defendants’ unlawful funding freeze has \nbeen real and irreparable harm to the recipients of that funding in this District and \nacross the country, as well as to the people and communities they serve. The Court’s \nintervention is required to stop further damage.  \nPARTIES \n1.  Plaintiff Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council (WRWC) \nis a nonprofit based in Providence, Rhode Island.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to \n28  U.S.C.  § 1331,  because  this  action  arises  under  federal  law,  specifically  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551, et seq.  \n17.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because at \nleast one Plaintiff resides in this District. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n18.  The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Pub. L. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 \n(2022), is a landmark piece of legislation that aims to fight inflation, expand domestic \nmanufacturing,  lower  energy  costs,  and  reduce  carbon  emissions,  among  other \nnotable goals.  \n19.  Among other things, the IRA authorizes and appropriates billions of \ndollars in funding for grants, loans, and other forms of federal financial assistance in \norder to advance these goals.  \n20.  Those programs are administered by various agencies. The Department \nof Agriculture, for example, administers billions of dollars in IRA funding, including \n$19.5 billion handled by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to help farmers, \nranchers, and other landowners protect natural resources and enhance production, \n$13.2  billion  to  build  electrification  infrastructure,  and  $2.4  billion  to  relieve \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 6 of 27 PageID #: 6\nthousands of distressed direct and guaranteed Farm Service Agency loan borrowers.1 \nAs of January 13, the EPA has awarded $38.4 billion in funds appropriated by IRA, \nrepresenting 93% of grant funding made available by the law.2   \n21.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. 117-58, 135 \nStat. 429 (2021), also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL, was \nenacted and signed into law in November 2021. It too funds a wide variety of critical \nprojects and initiatives that are administered by different agencies. \n22.  Among many other examples, EPA has awarded nearly $69 billion in \nIIJA funds to create jobs, lower energy costs, save families money, support clean \nenergy manufacturing, and help communities burdened by pollution.3 This includes \nfunding to ensure that water systems are safe and more resilient to natural disasters \nand cyber-attack threats; to improve air quality and create jobs at U.S. ports; and to \neliminate the Superfund cleanup backlog. Interior has awarded IIJA funds to close \nopen mine portals (protecting homes from landslides), clean up orphaned oil and gas \nwells, and support the federal wildland firefighting workforce.4 And Energy has \ndeployed its $97 billion in IIJA funding5 to upgrade America’s power grid to withstand \n \n1 U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Fact Sheet: Celebrating Two Years of the Inflation Reduction \nAct (Aug. 16, 2024), https://perma.cc/X37S-NKKC. \n2 Press Release, Env’t Prot.

In addition to the appropriations for grants funding created by the IRA \nand IIRA, the regulations that govern the administration of grants by the defendant \nagencies set out specific conditions and procedures for terminating and suspending \ngrants. 2 C.F.R §§ 200.339-200.343 (2024). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Unleashing American Energy Executive Order and OMB Memo M-25-11 \n24.  On  January  20,  2025,  President  Trump  signed  an  executive  order \nentitled Unleashing American Energy, Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353. \nThat order laid out, in Section 2, a nine-part “policy of the United States”: \na.  “to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal laws \nand waters,”; \nb.  “to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of \nnon-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals”; \nc.  “to protect the United States’s economic and national security and \nmilitary preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of \nreliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory”; \n \n6 Dep’t of Energy, Infrastructure Programs at Department of Energy, \nhttps://perma.cc/9WAU-H8UH; https://perma.cc/QG69-S3ZC (last visited Mar. 13, \n2025); Dep’t of Energy, Rural And Municipal Utility Advances Cybersecurity Grant \nAnd Technical Assistance Program, https://perma.cc/7GWT-5BPX (last visited Mar. \n13, 2025). \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 8 of 27 PageID #: 8\nd.  “to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are \ngrounded in clearly applicable law”; \ne.  “to eliminate the ‘electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true \nconsumer choice”; \nf.  “to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a \nvariety  of  goods  and  appliances,  including  by  not  limited  to \nlightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water \nheaters,  toilets,  and  shower  heads,  and  to  promote  market \ncompetition  and  innovation  within  the  manufacturing  and \nappliance industries”; \ng.  “to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action \nshall,  whenever  evaluated,  be  reported  separately  from  its \ndomestic costs and benefits”; \nh.  “to  guarantee  that  all  executive  departments  and  agencies \n(agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, \npeer-reviewed scientific analysis”; and \ni.  “to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner \ncontrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required \nby law.” \n25.  In Section 7, entitled “Terminating the Green New Deal,” the executive \norder  states:  “All  agencies  shall  immediately  pause  the  disbursement  of  funds \nappropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 9 of 27 PageID #: 9\nInfrastructure  Investment  and  Jobs  Act  (Public  Law  117-58),  including  but  not \nlimited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations . . . and shall review their \nprocesses,  policies,  and  programs  for  issuing  grants,  loans,  contracts,  or  other \nfinancial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and \nthe policy outlined in section 2 of this order.” \n26.  Section 7 further provides: “No funds identified in this subsection (a) \nshall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the \nPresident  for  Economic  Policy  have  determined  that  such  disbursements  are \nconsistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt.” \n27.  OMB adopted such review recommendations the next day, issuing a \n“Memorandum  to  the  Heads  of  Departments  and  Agencies”  numbered  M-25-11. \nEx. A.  The  subject  line:  “Guidance  Regarding  Section  7  of  the  Executive  Order \nUnleashing American Energy.” The memo was from Matthew J. Vaeth, the then-\nacting  director  of  OMB,  and  Kevin  Hassett,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for \nEconomic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council. \n28.  The memo stated: “The directive in section 7 of the Executive Order \nentitled  Unleashing  American  Energy  requires  agencies  to  immediately  pause \ndisbursement of funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public \nLaw 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58). \nThis pause only applies to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities that may \nbe implicated by the policy established in Section 2 of the order. This interpretation \nis consistent with section 7’s heading (‘Terminating the Green New Deal’) and its \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 10 of 27 PageID #: 10\nreference to the “law and policy outlined in section 2 of th[e] order” (alteration in \noriginal). \n29.  The memo continued: “For the purposes of implementing section 7 of the \nOrder,  funds  supporting  the  ‘Green  New  Deal’  refer  to  any  appropriations  for \nobjectives that contravene the policies established in section 2. Agency heads may \ndisburse  funds  as  they  deem  necessary  after  consulting  with  the  Office  of \nManagement and Budget.” \n30.  OMB  has  limited  statutory  authority  to  establish  governmentwide \nfinancial  management  policies  for  executive  agencies  and  to  provide  them  with \nguidance on financial management matters. 31 U.S.C. § 503(a). OMB lacks statutory \nauthority to direct executive agencies to undertake a blanket freeze of even a subset \nof funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. Cf. Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, \nNo. 1:25-cv-239, 2025 WL 597959, at *15 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (finding that OMB \nlikely  lacked  statutory  authority  to  direct  broad  halts  of  federal  funding  and \nexplaining that OMB’s statutory responsibilities to “provid[e] overall direction and \nestablishing financial management policies do not clearly confer the power to halt all \nfinances, full-stop, on a moment’s notice”). \nDefendants Have Broadly Frozen Funds Appropriated by the IRA and IIJA \n31.  Since the Unleashing American Energy order, Defendants have broadly \nfrozen the payment of funding appropriated under the IRA and IIJA. They have \nhalted payment of these funds—and halted activities related to the payment of these \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 11 of 27 PageID #: 11\nfunds, such as maintaining access to online portals through which grantees can draw \non open awards—en masse and on a non-individualized basis. \n32.  In doing so, numerous agencies have said outright what they were doing \nand why. \n33.  For  example,  at  EPA,  officials  sent  grant  recipients  an  e-mail  on \nJanuary 28 with the subject “Pause EPA Grants.” That e-mail stated: “Dear Grant \nRecipient, EPA is working diligently to implement President Trump’s Unleashing \nAmerican Energy Executive Order issued on January 20 in coordination with the \nOffice of Management and Budget. The agency has paused all funding actions related \nto the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at this \ntime. EPA is continuing to work with OMB as they review processes, policies, and \nprograms, as required by the Executive Order.” \n34.  On February 7, EPA’s Budget and Planning e-mail address sent an e-\nmail with the subject: “RE: Additional information on IIJA and IRA - program review \npause.”7 The e-mail stated: “Pursuant to the review of financial assistance programs \nannounced by the Acting Deputy Administrator on February 6, the following accounts \nare  temporarily  paused  for  new  obligations  or  disbursements  for  assistance \nagreements,  loans,  rebates,  interagency  agreements,  procurements,  and  no-cost \nactions pending a review for compliance with applicable administrative rules and \npolicies.” \n \n7 Brad Johnson, Trump EPA Again Freezes All Biden-Era Programs, Hill Heat (Feb. \n10, 2025), https://perma.cc/4CAN-3U52. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 12 of 27 PageID #: 12\n35.  As reflected in a March 7 letter from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse to \nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has recently informed senior staff that “all \n[funding] actions greater than $50,000 now require approval from an EPA DOGE \nTeam member.” See Ex. B. This process requires the program office to complete and \nsign an “EO Compliance Review Form” for every funding action to facilitate that \nreview. Id. That form requires an explanation of how the funding action “complies \nwith Executive Order requirements.” Id. at 6. These actions are consistent with the \n“freeze first, ask questions later” approach Defendants have adopted to releasing \nfunding.   \n36.  The Department of the Interior initiated a review of disbursements of \nfunds under the IRA and IIJA following the Unleashing American Energy executive \norder,8 and has “frozen billions in grants and loans stemming from those two bills” \npending that review.9 As one example, the National Park Service, a component of \nInterior,  has  refused  to  release  funding  appropriated  by  the  IRA  and  IIJA. \nIn communications with grant recipients, the National Park Service has stated that \n“NPS FA [financial assistance] agreements that include BIL or IRA funding” will \nremain frozen. As a result, members of Plaintiff NCN and others have been unable \nto access funds on open grants administered by the Department of the Interior. \n \n8 Sec’y of the Interior, Order No. 3418, Unleashing American Energy (Feb. 3, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/6CUZ-A89U. \n9 Austin Corona, Will Trump Review Lead to Smaller Monuments, More Mines on \nPublic Lands? What to Know, Ariz. Republic (Feb. 28, 2025), https://perma.cc/BYF8-\nQWMZ. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 13 of 27 PageID #: 13\n37.  The Department of Agriculture has likewise broadly frozen IRA and \nIIJA funding following the Unleashing American Energy executive order. Only on \nFebruary 20 did it announce that “the first tranche of funding that was paused due \nto the review of funding in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)” would be released—a \nmere $20 million out of the many billions of dollars in IRA funding that the agency \nadministers.10 That statement acknowledges both the agency’s broad freeze of IRA \nfunding and the immense scope of USDA funding that remains under a blanket \nfreeze. In short, the announcement confirms Plaintiff NCN’s members’ experiences \nthat USDA is taking precisely the “freeze first, ask questions later” tactic that they \nchallenge. This is consistent with reporting that IRA grant recipients under USDA \nwere  “shut  out  of  the  federal  grant  portal  that  is  used  to  distribute  money.”11 \nThe USDA has given no indication that any further “tranches” of funding have been \nreleased from the blanket freeze. \n38.  This blanket freeze has affected numerous programs at Agriculture. \nFor example, the IRA provides $1.5 billion in funding for the Urban and Community \nForestry  Program.  Pub.  L.  117-169,  §  23003(a),  136  Stat.  1818,  2026  (2022). \nThat program  is  administered  by  the  U.S.  Forest  Service,  a  component  of  the \nDepartment of Agriculture. The Urban and Community Forestry Program provides \ngrants to support efforts by states and partner organizations to plant and maintain \n \n10 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Secretary Rollins Releases the First Tranche of \nFunding Under Review (Feb. 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/UD67-F97T.  \n11 Jeremy Herbet al., ‘People Are Just Flipping Out’: Billions in Federal Funding \nRemain Frozen Despite Court Orders to Keep the Taps Open, CNN (Feb. 13, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/PHT3-GAJQ. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 14 of 27 PageID #: 14\ncommunity  trees,  forests,  and  green  spaces,  including  in  disadvantaged  areas. \nBecause of the freeze, Plaintiffs WRWC and GIC, other members of Plaintiff NCN, \nand countless others have been unable to access funds on open grants through that \nprogram.  \n39.  As another example, the IRA appropriates nearly $5 billion in funding \nuntil  fiscal  year  2026  for  the  Regional  Conservation  Partnership  Program. \nPub. L. 117-169,  §  21001(a)(4).  That  program  is  administered  by  the  Natural \nResource Conservation Service, a component of the Department of Agriculture. The \nRegional  Conservation  Partnership  Program  provides  funding  for  public-private \nconservation projects by landowners and communities. In an email to program grant \nrecipients dated March 11, NRCS stated that it would begin to authorize payments \non existing grants “except for IRA/BIL funded agreements.” As a result, members of \nPlaintiff NCN and others have been unable to access funds on open grants through \nthat program. \n40.  As to the Department of Energy, reporting has stated that IRA grant \nrecipients under Energy were likewise “shut out of the federal grant portal that is \nused to distribute money.”12 Reporting has also revealed that the Department of \nEnergy froze grants related to the IRA and IIJA, ultimately requiring review and \napproval by a political appointee before disbursement.13 As that reporting explains, \nbecause there are “easily thousands of transactions a week that a political appointee \n \n12 Jean Chemnick, Effects of Trump’s Spending Freeze Ripple Across Energy \nProjects, Politico (Feb. 6, 2025), https://perma.cc/NCT2-9AYS. \n13 Id. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 15 of 27 PageID #: 15\nwould suddenly now have to approve,” payments from these funding lines “just won’t \nget made or may be made late.” Supra note 11.    \n41.  As  one  example  of  the  effect  of  that  freeze:  The  IIJA  appropriates \n$3.5 billion in funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program. Pub. L. 117-58, \n§ 40551,  135  Stat.  448,  1075-76  (2021).  That  program  is  administered  by  the \nDepartment of Energy and enables low-income families to permanently reduce their \nenergy bills by making their households more energy efficient. As a result of the \nfreeze, members of Plaintiff NCN and others have been unable to access funds on \nopen grants through that program. \n42.  Because of these broad freezes, funding appropriated by the IRA and \nIIJA for particular grant programs has halted. The handful of examples described \nabove are merely evidence of a much wider freeze; Defendants have broadly frozen \nnumerous other sources of funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n43.  On information and belief, OMB has acted in concert with the other \nagency defendants to freeze funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n44.  First, OMB has directed agencies to freeze funds “for objectives that \ncontravene the policies established in section 2” of the Unleashing American Energy \nexecutive order, without legal basis, and without explaining how an agency should \ndetermine what “contravene[s]” those policies. \n45.  Second, OMB has directed agencies that they “may disburse funds as \nthey deem necessary after consulting with the Office of Management and Budget.” \nOn information and belief, to the extent that agencies have consulted with OMB \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 16 of 27 PageID #: 16\nabout the disbursement of funds they deem necessary, OMB has acted unreasonably \nand without basis in withholding that consent, and requiring the agencies to continue \nwithholding funds. \n46.  Officials  affiliated  with  DOGE  (encompassing  the  Department  of \nGovernment Efficiency, the U.S. DOGE Service, and/or the DOGE Service Temporary \nOrganization) have helped or directed EPA to freeze funding appropriated by the IRA \nand IIJA. On information and belief, officials affiliated with DOGE have done the \nsame at other defendant agencies. DOGE lacks any statutory authority to itself freeze \nthis funding. \nDefendants’ Freezes of These Funding Lines Are Final Agency Action  \n47.  The Administrative Procedure Act authorizes judicial review of final \nagency action. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n48.  Final agency actions are those (1) that “mark the ‘consummation’ of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154, 178 (1997) (quotation marks omitted). \n49.  Each Defendant’s freeze on funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA \nis final agency action subject to the Court’s review.  \n50.  The  freeze  of  funds  appropriated  by  the  IRA  and  IIJA  marks  the \nconsummation  of  the  agencies’  decisionmaking  process  because  it  immediately \nsuspends the payment of funds appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 17 of 27 PageID #: 17\n51.  The freeze of funds appropriated by the IRA and IIJA is also an action \nby  which  rights  or  obligations  have  been  determined  or  from  which  legal \nconsequences will flow because it halts the payment of funds appropriated by the IRA \nand IIJA that would otherwise be paid. \nPLAINTIFFS’ INJURIES \n \n52.  Defendants’ freeze of funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA has \ncaused, and if not enjoined will continue to cause, serious and irreversible harm to \nPlaintiffs’ members and many others. \n53.  Countless  states,  localities,  businesses,  and  nonprofits—including \nWRWC, ERICD, GIC, and other members of NCN—have been awarded grants and \nother  financial  assistance  through  the  IRA  and  IIJA.  That  money  funds  vital \nprograms ranging from wildfire prevention efforts to lead pipe remediation to efforts \nto control and contain invasive species to important scientific and ecological research \nto reforestation efforts and much more. \n54.  Many of the recipients of such funding—and, in particular, nonprofit \nrecipients such as Plaintiffs and other NCN members—rely on those sources of \nfunding in order to hire and pay staff, carry out what are frequently multiyear \nprojects for the benefit of the communities where they operate, and plan for the \nfuture. \n55.  Defendants’  freeze  has  already  seriously  damaged  those  nonprofits’ \nability to carry out their core missions and led them to have to halt ongoing projects.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 18 of 27 PageID #: 18\n56.  For example, WRWC has a $1 million grant (as a subgrantee) funded by \nthe U.S. Forest Service—but it has been frozen since January because the grant was \nfunded under the IRA. That freeze has completely halted WRWC’s planned project of \nbuilding capacity for urban forestry along the Woonasquatucket Greenway, and also \ndisrupted WRWC’s operations more broadly. \n57.  ERICD has a nearly $350,000 grant from EPA (as a subgrantee) that is \nfunded under the IRA. Those funds were intended to support education and outreach \nefforts to reduce food waste and its negative impacts on the environment, including \nsetting up the first municipal composting site in Rhode Island. But because ERICD’s \ngrant has been frozen on and off for weeks, it hasn’t been able to carry out the work \nit planned. ERICD is also a subgrantee of a USDA grant funded by the IRA—and \nthat grant has remained completely frozen since January. ERICD planned to use that \nmoney to hire another full-time staff person to help farmers use technology and data \nto grow more efficiently and sustainably. But because of the freeze, ERICD has not \nbeen able to hire that staff person, and so fewer farmers receive help.  \n58.  GIC, one of NCN’s members that operates in Rhode Island and several \nother states, receives both IRA and IIJA funding. Those grants make up fully 80 \npercent  of  their  budget.  Their  IRA  funding  comes  through  the  Department  of \nAgriculture and goes toward efforts to plant and maintain community trees, forests, \nand green spaces, including in disadvantaged areas.  \n59.  GIC has had to stop work as a result of the Department of Agriculture’s \nfreeze on payments. They hired new staff specifically to complete IRA-funded work \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 19 of 27 PageID #: 19\nbut now have had to furlough some staff and, if the funds remain frozen, will need to \nlay off not only their new hires but the rest of their staff as well. They have been \nunable to plan for the future and do not know, for example, whether they will have \nthe money to pay for trees they need to order now to have ready for planting seasons \nin the fall. They worked hard to build trust in communities that are frequently \nskeptical of government programs in order to be able to successfully carry out long-\nterm projects; the freeze has shattered that trust. \n60.  Another NCN member carries out research and conservation work to \nprotect giant sequoias and other large trees. They rely on funds from both the IRA \nand IIJA from the Department of Interior. Because of Defendants’ funding freeze, \nthey  have  been  unable  to  draw  on  IRA-appropriated  funds  through  a  grant \nsupporting work to research and monitor bark beetles that can infest and kill giant \nsequoia trees.  \n61.  If the freeze continues, the group is likely to have to postpone the project \nuntil next year, even as bark beetles are currently in the process of attacking ancient \ntrees  that  cannot  be  replaced.  Halting  that  data  collection  will  have  cascading \nimpacts on their scientific progress as well. And because of the funding freeze, the \ngroup has already had to postpone hiring a new full-time employee to add to their \nstaff of four, as well as hiring up to six part-time contractors. Not being able to add \nthat extra capacity has a meaningful impact on the amount of work the group is able \nto do to fulfill its mission. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 20 of 27 PageID #: 20\n62.  Another  NCN  member  is  dedicated  to  watershed  protection  and \nrestoration in a Western state. They too receive funds appropriated under the IRA \nand IIJA for a number of different projects but have seen funds administered by the \nDepartment of Agriculture frozen as a result of Defendants’ actions.  \n63.  That freeze has already put on hold a land-management project to clear \nvegetation in order to reduce the risk of wildfires and improve habitat and water \nquality in the area. Keeping that project on ice increases the danger of wildfires this \nsummer and threatens local water quality. It is also already hurting the group. They \nhired new staff in reliance on a grant of IRA funds they cannot currently access. As a \nresult, they do not know how much longer they will be able to continue paying their \nnew employee or when their work might resume. \n64.  Yet another NCN member, which engages hundreds of youth and young \nadults in programs to improve access to outdoor recreation, restore natural habitats, \nprotect waterways, and respond to community needs and natural disasters, has \napproximately $621,000 in federal grants from Interior frozen.   \n65.  As a result, that organization can no longer use those funds as planned \nto support an invasive plant management team that would work with national parks \nin the central United States. That will result in potentially thousands of acres not \nbeing managed, with negative impacts for visitors to public lands, hunting and \nfishing, and wildlife populations due to loss of habitat. And the organization cannot \nmake up for that delay: If they are ever able to manage these invasive species in the \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 21 of 27 PageID #: 21\nfuture, it will be more difficult and more expensive because they will have spread \nmore.  \n66.  And yet another NCN member runs a weatherization training center, \nwhich helps weatherize the homes of low-income Americans in an effort to lower their \nutility bills when they are struggling to make ends meet, which helps them stay in \ntheir homes and also improves air quality and health and safety in the home. That \nmember typically trains over 200 people in about 40 classes per year. But the funding \nfor that weatherization program comes entirely from IIJA funds awarded by the \nDepartment of Energy, and those funds have been frozen since January. \n67.  As  a  result,  that  member  has  had  to  stop  offering  weatherization \ntraining, which means that people living in poverty are less safe in their homes and \nless able to make ends meet. Because of the funding freeze, that member has also had \nto pause all work on a two-year program to gain expertise in offering training to \nweatherization departments, which would ultimately  enable them to weatherize \nmore homes. And the member has had to cancel a planned conference, undermining \ntheir relationships with speakers and attendees from their community. \n68.  These stories are just a few examples of a much broader picture of \ninstability, confusion, and irreparable harm created by Defendants’ actions.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—706(2)(A) \nArbitrary and Capricious  \n(Against All Defendants) \n69.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 22 of 27 PageID #: 22\n70.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n. . . found to be arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n71.  Defendants’ freeze on funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA is \narbitrary and capricious in multiple respects. Several examples follow. \n72.  First, Defendants’ payment freeze fails to account for the catastrophic \npractical consequences that it has already produced and, if not stopped, will continue \nto produce. In this and other respects, Defendants “entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem.” See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n73.  Second, Defendants’ funding freeze fails to account for the substantial \nreliance interests in the ordinary disbursement of funds authorized by the IRA and \nIIJA that the freeze radically disrupts. “When an agency changes course . . . it must \nbe  cognizant  that  longstanding  policies  may  have  engendered  serious  reliance \ninterests that must be taken into account,’’ and the failure to do so is arbitrary and \ncapricious. DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). \n74.  Third, Defendants’ funding freeze contradicts Defendant OMB’s own \ndirective. That directive instructs agencies that the order to pause funding in the \nUnleashing American Energy executive order does not apply to all funding authorized \nby the IRA and IIJA but only “to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities \nthat  may  be  implicated  by  the  policy  established  in  Section  2  of  the  order.” \nDefendants, however, have continued to pause funding authorized by the IRA and \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 23 of 27 PageID #: 23\nIIJA  well  outside  that  scope.  By  freezing  payments  without  reason  and  in \ncontravention  of  the  administration’s  own  interpretation  of  the  executive  order, \nDefendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously. \n75.  Defendants  Department  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Energy, \nDepartment  of  the  Interior,  EPA,  and  their  leaders  have  acted  arbitrarily  and \ncapriciously by halting funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA.  \n76.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendants \nOMB, Director Vought, and Director Hassert have acted arbitrarily and capriciously \nby withholding purportedly necessary approvals to the other Defendants to release \nfunding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA.  \nCount Two \nAdministrative Procedure Act–706(2)(C) \nIn Excess of Statutory Authority \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n77.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n78.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n. . . found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n79.  “An  agency  .  .  .  literally  has  no  power  to  act—including  under  its \nregulations—unless and until Congress authorizes it to do so by statute.” FEC v. \nCruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n80.  No  statutory  provision  authorizes  Defendants  Department  of \nAgriculture, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, or EPA to freeze \nfunding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 24 of 27 PageID #: 24\n81.  Defendants  Department  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Energy, \nDepartment of the Interior, EPA, and their leaders therefore have acted in excess of \nstatutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right  in \nwithholding those funds. \n82.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendants \nOMB,  Director  Vought,  and  Director  Hassett  have  acted  in  excess  of  statutory \nauthority by withholding purportedly necessary approvals to the other Defendants to \nrelease funding authorized by the IRA and IIJA. \n83.  OMB’s organic statute gives it responsibilities for establishing financial \nmanagement  policies  and  requirements  for  executive  agencies,  see  31  U.S.C. \n§§ 503(a), 504, which can include providing guidance to agencies on understanding \nexecutive orders. \n84.  But  no  statutory  provision  authorizes  OMB,  Director  Vought,  or \nDirector Hassett to require executive agencies to freeze funding authorized by the \nIRA and IIJA.  \nCount Three \nAdministrative Procedure Act–706(2)(A) \nContrary to Law \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n85.   Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n86.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action \n. . . found to be . . . not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n87.  The APA’s reference to “law” in the phrase “not in accordance with law,” \n“means, of course, any law, and not merely those laws that the agency itself is charged \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 25 of 27 PageID #: 25\nwith administering.” FCC v. NextWave Pers. Commc’ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) \n(emphasis in original). \n88.  The IRA and IIJA appropriate money for specific purposes and expressly \ndirect that the money be put to those purposes.  \n89.  By freezing funds appropriated under the IRA and IIJA and refusing to \ndirect that money to the purposes Congress specified in those laws, Defendants are \nacting contrary to law. \n90.  The regulations that govern the administration of grants by Defendants \nDepartment of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and \nEPA  set  out  specific  conditions and  procedures  for  terminating  and  suspending \ngrants. \n91.  Defendants have not followed the procedures set out in those governing \nregulations  and  have  frozen  payment  on  grants  in  circumstances  in  which  the \nregulations would not allow those grants to be terminated or suspended. By doing so, \nDefendants are acting contrary to law. \n92.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendants \nOMB,  Director  Vought,  and  Director  Hassert  have  acted  contrary  to  law  by \nwithholding purportedly  necessary approvals to the other Defendants to release \nfunding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 26 of 27 PageID #: 26\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter the following relief: \na.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 1 of 8 PageID #:\n1325\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND \n \nWOONASQUATUCKET RIVER   \nWATERSHED COUNCIL, et al.,   \n   \n                       Plaintiffs,   \n   \n  v.  Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-97 (MSM) \n   \nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, \net al., \n \n      Defendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO STAY \nPROCEEDINGS \n \n  Consistent with Chief Judge McConnell’s stay order in New York v. Trump and \nwith numerous other district court rulings around the country in a similar posture—\nwhere stays were granted because resolution of an appeal in the same or a similar \nmatter may guide the district court in deciding issues before it—Defendants have \nrequested a stay of district court proceedings until Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s \npreliminary injunction order is resolved.  See ECF No. 70 (“Stay Mot.”).  Plaintiffs \noppose Defendants’ requested stay.  See ECF No. 71 (“Stay Opp’n”).  But Plaintiffs’ \nopposition only underscores the harm to the Government and to the interests of \njudicial economy without such a stay, while failing to demonstrate any cognizable \nprejudice Plaintiffs would suffer if a stay is granted.  A stay of proceedings is more \nthan justified here.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 2 of 8 PageID #:\n1326\n  First, Plaintiffs do not meaningfully contest that many (if not all) of the critical \nlegal issues presented in Plaintiffs’ Complaint are now before the First Circuit, and \nthat it would serve the interests of judicial economy to await the First Circuit’s \nguidance.  See Stay Mot. at 4–5; see also id. at 9–10.  Nor do Plaintiffs grapple with \nthe fact that a stay is particularly warranted where, as here, the higher court will be \nconsidering issues bearing on Article III standing and the district court’s jurisdiction \nto proceed at all.  Id. at 7.  Instead, Plaintiffs merely argue that the Court should \ncontinue proceedings because, if it enters final judgment, then the appeal may become \nmoot.  See Stay Opp’n at 5–6.  But there is no reason to rush forward in district court \nand deny the appellate court the opportunity to consider identical issues.  To the \ncontrary, Plaintiffs’ approach would effectively deprive Defendants of the opportunity \nto obtain appellate review of the preliminary injunction, and instead require the \nappeal to start all over after final judgment.  Thus, continuing proceedings would not \nonly frustrate judicial economy in this Court but in the appellate court as well. \n  Plaintiffs further argue that a stay is not warranted because Defendants have \nmoved to put the Woonasquatucket appeal in abeyance pending resolution of the \nappeal in New York v. Trump.  See Stay Opp’n at 5; see also Stay Mot. at 10 n.2.1  But \n \n1 On May 27, 2025, the First Circuit set a briefing schedule in the appeal of \nthis case, with the Government’s opening brief and appendix being due on July 7, \n2025, and Plaintiff-Appellees’ response brief due 30 days later, on August 6, 2025.  \nSee Briefing Schedule Order, Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Agriculture, No. 25-1428 (May 27, 2025).  Later that day, the Government moved \nto hold the appeal in abeyance pending resolution of the New York v. Trump appeal.  \nSee Mot. to Hold Appeal in Abeyance, Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, No. 25-1428 (May 27, 2025). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 3 of 8 PageID #:\n1327\nPlaintiffs do not contest that New York v. Trump involves many of the same legal \nissues as in this case, and therefore that its resolution would likely provide guidance \nregarding this case, if not entirely dispose of it.  Thus, while Plaintiffs assert that this \ncircumstance shows that a stay “would undermine, not promote, judicial efficiency,” \nStay Opp’n at 5, the Government’s motion to put the Woonasquatucket appeal in \nabeyance is aimed precisely at promoting judicial economy, particularly since the \nappeal in New York v. Trump is already underway, with the Government’s opening \nbrief already having been filed on May 27, 2025.  \n  Second, Plaintiffs fail to address the potentially protracted and burdensome \nlitigation if this matter is not stayed.  As laid out in Defendants’ motion to stay, if the \nCourt were to deny a stay, then the parties would be required to brief and litigate a \nmotion to dismiss—even though that motion would present many of the same legal \narguments the Government has asked the First Circuit to address.  See Stay Mot. at \n5.  If the Court were to deny that motion to dismiss, Defendants would be required to \ncompile and produce Administrative Records for a host of vaguely defined agency \nactions.  This would likely be followed by requests by Plaintiffs for further discovery, \nas Plaintiffs have already forecast doing.  See Stay Opp’n at 9 (requesting a schedule \nby which Plaintiffs “could submit requests for additional discovery”); but see Camp v. \nPitts, 411 U.S 138, 142 (1973) (“[T]he focal point for judicial review should be the \nadministrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the \nreviewing court.”); Common Sense Salmon Recovery v. Evans, 217 F. Supp. 2d 17, 20 \n(D.D.C. 2002) (there is a “basic rule that generally discovery is not permitted in \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 4 of 8 PageID #:\n1328\nAdministrative Procedure Act cases because a court’s review of an agency’s decision \nis confined to the administrative record”).  At that point, at a minimum the parties \nwould need to litigate—and the Court would need to resolve—any dispute about the \npropriety of discovery.  If such discovery were granted—despite the normal rule that \ndiscovery is impermissible in APA actions—there may be privilege disputes and other \nissues that require substantial expenditure of the Court’s and the parties’ time and \nresources.  Of course, these burdens on the parties and the Court would be incurred \nall while the First Circuit is considering legal issues that may effectively resolve the \ncase—including questions of the Court’s jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place.  \nThe burden on the parties and harm to judicial economy in the absence of a stay is \nmanifest.  \n  Third, Plaintiffs do not contest that, during the pendency of the requested \nstay, this Court’s preliminary injunction would protect them from any continuing \nharms allegedly stemming from the challenging actions in this case.  See Stay Mot. \nat 8–9.  Instead, Plaintiffs only suggest that a stay would “‘work damage’ to [them]” \nbecause it would delay the development of a factual record.  Stay Opp’n at 7 (quoting \nLandis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 255 (1936)).  But this circular logic—that a stay \nof proceedings harms them because it stays the record development proceedings—\ndoes not state a distinct harm particular to the positions of the parties in this case \nand depends on the questionable proposition that delayed access to record evidence, \nuntied to any pressing need for that evidence, is somehow prejudicial.  See In re Pabst \nLicensing GmbH & Co. KG Pat. Litig., 320 F. Supp. 3d 132, 139 (D.D.C. 2018) (“a \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 5 of 8 PageID #:\n1329\n‘generalized claim’ that ‘memories will fade and discovery may likely be lost’ carries \n‘little weight’ in the absence of ‘any showing as to particular evidence or discovery \nthat is at risk of being lost.’” (quoting NFC Tech. LLC v. HTC Am., Inc., No. 2:13-CV-\n1058-WCB, 2015 WL 1069111 (E.D. Tex. 2015))).  Furthermore, there is no basis to \nfear that delaying compilation of the record in this case would reduce its quality.  See \nStay Opp’n at 8 (declaring in merely conclusory fashion that “the passage of time will \ndegrade the quality of the administrative record”).   \nThe case law cited by Plaintiffs on this issue is inapposite.  In Katz v. Liberty \nPower Corp., LLC, No. 18-cv-10506, 2020 WL 3440886 (D. Mass. June 23, 2020), the \ncourt  specifically  reasoned  that  Plaintiffs  had  “already  documented  the  loss  of \npotential  evidence  in  this  case,”  id.  at  *4,  which  Plaintiffs  here have  not  even \nattempted to do.  Meanwhile, in Hall v. Toro, No. 18-cv-355, 2022 WL 2752621 (D.R.I. \nJuly 14, 2022), the Court denied a request for “indefinite continuation” of a stay \nbecause “a temporary stay should not be continued at the request of a mentally ill \nplaintiff who is not likely to improve.”  Id. at *4, *7.  The Court also noted that the \ncase had already been “protracted and delayed” and that it related to events that \noccurred “almost five years ago.”  Id. at *6.  Thus, the circumstances of that case, and \nthe court’s reasoning for denying a stay, are not comparable to this case.  Finally, \nPlaintiffs cite Pagtalunan v. Galaza, 291 F.3d 639 (9th Cir. 2002), but that decision \ndid not address a stay motion, but instead related to a dismissal of a habeas petition. \nIn contrast to these distinguishable situations, courts routinely grant stays of district \ncourt  proceedings  pending  future  appellate  guidance—without  causing  any \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 6 of 8 PageID #:\n1330\ncognizable harm to the parties or the litigation—and this case is no exception to that \ncommon practice.  See Stay Mot. at 5–7. \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ suggestion “[i]n the alternative” that the parties “mov[e] \nforward with the administrative record and any necessary discovery” while the case \nis otherwise stayed (Stay Opp’n at 9) is improper, because it would effectively prevent \nDefendants from moving to dismiss the case prior to assembling the Administrative \nRecord and engaging in any discovery the Court might allow.  Plaintiffs draw an \nanalogy to the district court’s stay order in the National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB \ncase.  However, in that case, the Government moved to dismiss the case while \nsimultaneously opposing the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, and \nthe district court denied that motion to dismiss.  See Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. \nOMB, 763 F. Supp. 3d 36 (D.D.C. 2025). Thus, the district court in that case did not \norder the parties to move forward with production of the Administrative Record and \nany discovery prior to giving the Government an opportunity to have a motion to \ndismiss filed and resolved, as Plaintiffs ask for here. \n*  *  * \n  For the foregoing reasons and those set forth in Defendants’ motion, the Court \nshould grant Defendants’ motion to stay further proceedings in this matter until \nDefendants’ appeal of this Court’s order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction is resolved.  \n \n   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 72     Filed 05/29/25     Page 7 of 8 PageID #:\n1331\nDated: May 29, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

In New York, plaintiffs challenge what they characterize as “a pause on \nfederal funding” effectuated by an Office of Management and Budget memorandum \nand several of the President’s Executive Orders, including Executive Order No. \n14,154, titled Unleashing American Energy.  See New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39, 2025 \nWL 715621, at *6 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025).  The district court’s analysis in that case \nfocused on certain grant programs, including many involving funds appropriated \nunder the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Improvement and \n\nJobs Act (IIJA).  See id. at *2.  The court concluded that the Unleashing American Energy \nExecutive Order and implementing guidance “instruct[ed] that agencies immediately \npause disbursements of funds under the IRA or IIJA.”  Id. at *9.  And the court \nconcluded that agencies could not lawfully implement a categorical funding freeze for \ncertain programs under the IRA and IIJA where, in the court’s view, Congress \n“strictly prescribed how [appropriated] funds must be expended.”  Id. at *10. \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction on March 6.  The court \nenjoined the government defendants—which include 23 federal agencies—from \n“pausing, freezing, blocking, canceling, suspending, terminating, or otherwise \nimpeding the disbursement of appropriated federal funds to the States under awarded \ngrants, executed contracts, or other executed financial obligations based on,” among \nother things, “funding freezes dictated, described, or implied by [certain] Executive \nOrders,” including but “by no means . . . limited to” the Unleashing American Energy \nExecutive Order.  New York, 2025 WL 715621, at *16.  The government’s appeal of \nthe district court’s preliminary injunction is docketed as No. 25-1236. \nThe district court in New York granted a motion to enforce the preliminary \ninjunction as to certain funding administered by one of the agency defendants.  See \nNew York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39, 2025 WL 1009025 (D.R.I. Apr. 4, 2025).  The \ngovernment moved for reconsideration, explaining that the district court lacked \njurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to issue such an order “to \nenforce a contractual obligation to pay money” and that “the ‘Tucker Act grants the \n2 \n \n\nCourt of Federal Claims jurisdiction over’” such claims.  New York v. Trump, No. 25-\ncv-39, 2025 WL 1098966, at *2 (D.R.I. Apr. 14, 2025) (quoting Department of Educ. v. \nCalifornia, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) (per curiam)).  The district court denied \nreconsideration, id. at *3, and the government’s appeal of the district court’s order is \ndocketed as No. 25-1413.  This Court consolidated the two appeals, and the \ngovernment’s opening brief is due today, May 27. \n2.  The allegations and legal issues in this case substantially overlap with those \nin New York.  All six agency defendants in this case—Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Energy, Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Office of \nManagement and Budget, see Dkt. No. 21, at 4-5—are defendants in New York.  As in \nNew York, plaintiffs here allege that, under “the Unleashing American Energy order, \nDefendants have broadly frozen funding appropriated under the IRA and IIJA.”  Id. \nat 12.  Indeed, plaintiffs themselves listed New York as a related case in their civil \ncover sheet.  See Dkt. No. 1-3, at 1 (listing district court docket number 25-cv-39). \nThe district court’s April 15 decision in this case granting plaintiffs’ motion for \na preliminary injunction parallels the reasoning in New York.  The court explained that \nplaintiffs challenge agency decisions to “summarily freez[e] IIJA and IRA funds” \npursuant to guidance implementing the Unleashing American Energy Executive Order \nthat “mandat[es] a pause.”  Dkt. No. 45, at 24-25.  The court discussed New York \nrepeatedly throughout its opinion.  See, e.g., id. at 22, 28, 35, 37, 42, 51-52.  For \n3 \n \n\nexample, the court stated that “the New York Court’s analysis is instructive,” id. at 42, \nand that “[t]he court’s analysis there is on-point and bears repeating,” id. at 51.  And \non the Tucker Act issue, the district court in this case “agree[d] and adopt[ed]” New \nYork’s “reasoning in full.”  Id. at 35. \nThe preliminary injunction in this case also contains similar language to that \nused in the preliminary injunction in New York.  The district court enjoined the agency \ndefendants from “freezing, halting, or pausing on a non-individualized basis the \nprocessing and payment of funding that (1) was appropriated under the Inflation \nReduction Act or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and (2) has already been \nawarded.”  Dkt. No. 45, at 61.  The court further ordered the agency defendants to \n“take immediate steps to resume the processing, disbursement, and payment of \nalready-awarded funding appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act or the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and to release awarded funds previously \nwithheld or rendered inaccessible.”  Id. \n3.  Under the circumstances, it is in the interest of the parties and the Court for \nthis appeal to be held in abeyance pending this Court’s resolution of New York, where \nthe government’s opening brief is due today.  Abeyance will conserve the resources of \nthe Court and the parties because issues in this case could be effectively resolved or \nnarrowed by the disposition in New York.  Neither this Court nor the parties would \nbenefit from repetitive briefing of the same issues.  At a minimum, the decision in \nNew York is likely to bear on the issues here.  It would be inefficient to have the \n4 \n \n\nparties file briefs addressing issues on which this Court will provide guidance in New \nYork, only to have the parties submit additional briefs addressing that intervening \ndecision.  The far more prudent course is to allow the parties to take this Court’s \nruling in New York into account in briefing this appeal in the first instance.  Moreover, \nplaintiffs face no prejudice from holding this appeal in abeyance, as they will continue \nto benefit from the district court’s preliminary injunction in the meantime. \n4.

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY \n  Most importantly, the Court found that EPA’s decision to terminate roughly \n800 grants did not violate the preliminary injunction.  There are several reasons why. \n  To start, the Court’s order granting relief to the Nonprofits was fundamentally \nabout pauses, not terminations.  As the order noted, the Court “need not delve into \nwhether and how the Government retains the authority” to terminate agreements, \n“because that question is not before it.”  (ECF No. 45 at 54.)  And “conducting an \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 68     Filed 05/06/25     Page 2 of 5 PageID #:\n1259\nindividualized termination under federal regulations is worlds away from the sudden, \nindefinite, across-the-board, and likely unlawful freezes that happened here.”  Id.   \n  The Nonprofits have previously—and consistently—argued as much, too.  See, \ne.g., ECF No. 26 at 2 (“This case concerns . . . the freeze on billions of dollars in \nfunding  appropriated  by  two  laws  passed  by  Congress  during  the  prior \nadministration . . . .”); ECF No. 38 at 4 (“Here, of course, Plaintiffs do not challenge \nindividual terminations and do not seek grant-specific remedies. Rather, Plaintiffs \nhere bring an APA challenge to programmatic policies to freeze all IRA and IIJA \nfunding administered across numerous defendant agencies, without regard for any \nparticular  grant  agreement.”);  ECF  No. 42  at 3  (“While  the California  majority \nconcluded that the claims over individual terminations were, in essence, contract \nclaims, the same plainly is not true of Plaintiffs’ challenges to the broad freeze policies \nand to Memo M-25-11.”).  So everyone agrees: freezes and terminations are different. \n  Recognizing  that,  the  Nonprofits  argued  (1)  that  these  roughly  800 \nterminations were not individualized and (2) that they instead serve as a mass \n“permanent freeze.”  (ECF No. 65 at 4–6.)  The Court is unconvinced on either point. \n  As to the “individualized terminations” argument: EPA has terminated (or \nslated for termination) only about 800 of the approximately 3,000 IIJA and IRA \ngrants that were previously frozen.  See ECF No. 51-1 ¶¶ 4–6.  That suggests to the \nCourt that a more thoroughgoing individualized review had taken place between the \nmass freeze and the Court’s order enjoining it.  Sworn testimony from a longtime EPA \nofficial confirmed as much.  See id. ¶¶ 3–6 (describing an “individualized, grant-by-\n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 68     Filed 05/06/25     Page 3 of 5 PageID #:\n1260\ngrant review to determine which grants should continue, which should be modified, \nand which should be terminated”). \n  Of  course,  the  Court  did  not  determine  that  the  review  was  sufficiently \nindividualized just because the declaration said so.  The Court has rejected “magic \nwords” theories from the Government since the case began.  (ECF No. 39 at 65–66, \n77, 94.)  And courts are “not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens \nare free.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (cleaned up).  But \nwithin the broader context of the case, the Court sees it as plausible that these 800 \ntermination decisions were individually made over several months.  Had it been the \ncase that all 3,000 were conveniently slated for termination following the freeze, the \nCourt would likely have viewed the situation with much greater skepticism. \n  To  be  sure,  there  can  be  reasonable  differences  of  opinion  about  what \nconstitutes  an  individualized  review.    But  the  Court  determined  that  EPA’s \nexplanation was sufficiently specific in this context: compliance proceedings about an \ninjunction forbidding a much broader pause.1 Going under the hood and looking for \nmore—and thus calling into question a sworn declaration based on little more than \nvague, unsubstantiated suspicions—would bring the case far afield from the original \n \n1 To be clear, the Court’s determination that these were sufficient individualized \nshould only be read in the context of compliance with the Court’s injunction about \nthat much broader pause.  A separate lawsuit with these terminations as the central \nagency actions might require a closer look or a different analysis. But this Court, in \nthis case, cannot undertake either without inappropriately expanding the injunction. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 68     Filed 05/06/25     Page 4 of 5 PageID #:\n1261\nissues.  Put differently, the Nonprofits’ position would turn Section 2 of the Court’s \norder into much more than it was.   \n  As  to  the  “permanent  freeze”  argument:  the  Court  disagrees  with  that \ncharacterization of EPA’s actions.  Its termination letters explain that grantees can \ndispute the lost funds via processes laid out in federal regulations.  (ECF No. 65-1 \nat 2.)  That is different than how the Nonprofits correctly described EPA’s previous \npauses-pending-termination—a “kind of pre-termination limbo in which neither their \nfunding nor these processes are available to them.” (ECF No. 55 at 7.)   \n  Recognizing that limbo, the Court ordered those pauses-pending-termination \nto end.  (ECF No. 58 at 4–5.)  That fixed both problems.  For a short while, it freed up \ntheir funding.  See, e.g., ECF No. 65 at 2 (“As to Plaintiff Childhood Lead Action \nProject: on April 28, EPA restored its grant drawdown access, and CLAP processed \nits drawdown backlog.  CLAP received those funds the following day.”)  And now the \nNonprofits have access to processes to dispute the terminations.  (ECF No. 65-1 at 3.)  \nOf course, that is not the only process available to them.  Even though the Court finds \nthat these terminations do not violate the preliminary injunction, the Nonprofits are \nfree to file another lawsuit challenging what they see as a mass termination. \n  All that is to say: on this record, EPA’s termination of roughly 800 grants does \nnot violate the preliminary injunction.  An agency’s decision to suddenly, indefinitely \nfreeze all IRA and IIJA funding creates fundamentally different legal issues than its \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS     Document 68     Filed 05/06/25     Page 5 of 5 PageID #:\n1262\ndecision (or rather, its decisions) to cut about one-fourth of those grants following \nwhat it described as a months-long individualized review. \nII.  NEXT STEPS \n  At the end of the conference, the Government suggested that it would move to \nstay further proceedings in this case pending the First Circuit’s resolution of its \nappeal of the preliminary injunction. \n  The Court directs the Government to file that motion by the end of the day on \nMonday, May 19.  Any opposition should be submitted by the end of the day on \nMonday, May 26.  If the Government ultimately decides not to move for a stay of \nfurther proceedings, or if the Court denies the motion, the Court will then schedule a \nconference for the parties to discuss appropriate next steps.  \n  Meanwhile, the Court welcomes status reports from the parties if further \ncompliance issues arise.  Otherwise, no further action—beyond briefing the motion to \nstay—is necessary for now. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n_________________________________  \nMary S.
