    "summary": "<p>This suit challenged the Federal Emergency Management Agency&rsquo;s (FEMA) repeated blocking of grant reimbursements under the Congressionally-funded Next Generation Warning System (NGWS), a program to modernize the nation&rsquo;s emergency alert infrastructure. On March 13, 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against FEMA and its acting administrator Cameron Hamilton. The case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly.</p>\r\n<p>CPB, represented by Saul Ewing LLP, alleged that FEMA unlawfully froze access to funds already awarded and obligated under the NGWS grant, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Uniform Guidance (2 C.F.R. Part 200), and federal court orders barring the implementation of a White House directive (OMB Memorandum M-25-13) suspending federal awards. CPB administers the NGWS program on behalf of Congress and subawards funding to public broadcasters across the country to upgrade emergency communications infrastructure. CPB asserted that FEMA&rsquo;s actions left over $2.7 million in already-incurred expenses unreimbursed, paralyzed additional upgrades, and endangered critical public alerting capacity in rural and disaster-prone regions.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint and subsequent declarations, FEMA repeatedly toggled access to its Payment and Reporting System (PARS), used for grant reimbursements, without notice or explanation. CPB alleged that FEMA&rsquo;s actions defied federal regulations governing grant management, violated due process requirements, and caused irreparable harm to both CPB and its 42 subgrantee broadcasters. CPB also contended that FEMA ignored binding court orders&mdash;including injunctions from other federal courts&mdash;prohibiting implementation of the funding freeze.</p>\r\n<p>On the day it filed this lawsuit, CPB moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to restore access to the PARS system and enjoin FEMA from interfering with the grant. The court denied the TRO after a March 17 hearing, finding that CPB had not yet demonstrated irreparable harm. FEMA then reinstated partial access to PARS but continued to subject CPB to what it described as a &ldquo;manual review process,&rdquo; which CPB claimed was unlawful, burdensome, and pretextual.</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, CPB moved for a preliminary injunction (PI). CPB presented evidence that FEMA&rsquo;s conduct violated multiple federal statutes, including 2 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 200.305 and 200.341, and ignored prior injunctions issued in Nat&rsquo;l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB (D.D.C.) and New York v. Trump (D.R.I.). CPB also argued that FEMA had improperly injected questions about &ldquo;support to aliens&rdquo; into the reimbursement process, despite the NGWS grant having no connection to immigration-related activity.</p>\r\n<p>CPB&rsquo;s brief documented widespread operational harm, citing delays in public alerting upgrades, disruptions to emergency communications in underserved areas, loss of trust from partner stations, and the erosion of CPB&rsquo;s reputation. CPB requested a preliminary injunction directing FEMA to maintain access to PARS, timely process reimbursement requests, and provide 30 days&rsquo; notice before suspending access in the future.</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, the court denied CPB's motion for preliminary injunction. In June, FEMA reopened the PARS funding portal for CPB, the closure of which was the basis for CPB's preliminary injunction. The court reasoned that, because CPB could again access the portal, there could be no irreparable harm and therefore no PI was warranted. One week later, on July 22, FEMA moved for summary judgment on the grounds that CPB fails to allege any final agency action, and that any agency action taken by FEMA was lawful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, the court granted a third extension of time to file a response in opposition to FEMA's motion to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Civil Action No. 25-740 (TJK) \nFEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT \nAGENCY, et al., \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nPublic broadcasting stations help inform the public of impending disasters by disseminat-\ning emergency alerts.  To assist these stations—especially those in remote areas of the country—\nupdate their aging equipment, the Federal Emergency Management Agency chose the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting to administer the Next Generation Warning System Grant Program.  CPB \nissues sub-awards to broadcasting stations, who buy and install new equipment and then seek re-\nimbursement from CPB.  CPB, in turn, draws funds from FEMA through a payment portal called \nPARS.  In February 2025, FEMA abruptly closed that portal and, for many weeks, either did not \nprocess CPB’s reimbursement requests or significantly delayed releasing those funds.  That effec-\ntively brought the grant program to a standstill; CPB’s sub-awardees sat on unreimbursed costs \nand uninstalled equipment.  So in March 2025, CPB sued.  When the portal reopened but then shut \ndown again in May, CPB signaled it would seek a preliminary injunction.  But then in early June, \nFEMA again restored CPB’s access to PARS, and it remains open today.  Even though CPB can \nnow draw funds from PARS for the grant program, it moves for a preliminary injunction requiring \nFEMA to keep the portal open.  But the status quo—an open portal—largely dooms CPB’s motion \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 2 of 22\nbecause it cannot show that it will likely suffer irreparable harm without the preliminary injunction \nit seeks.  So the Court will deny the motion. \nI.  Background \nA.  FEMA’s National Emergency Alerting System and Grant Program \nThe government maintains a national emergency alerting system created in 2006, which \nallows the President as well as federal, state, and local authorities to send emergency alerts.  See \nE.O. 13407, 71 Fed. Reg. 36975 (June 26, 2006).  The Integrated Public Alert & Warning System \n(“IPAWS”) is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) and “serves \nas a gateway between” alerting authorities and “national communications networks”—think radio, \ntelevision, and cell phone networks.  The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS): \nPrimer and Issues for Congress, Congressional Research Services 1–2, (Mar. 5, 2025).1  Using \n“specialized software,” authorities submit a message to IPAWS, which then “validates” and \n“broadcasts” the alert to relevant communities “by using public broadcasting equipment.”  ECF \nNo. 1 (“Compl.”) ¶¶ 12–13.  Public broadcasting stations “reach 99% of the American population,” \nand in many parts of the country, particularly rural communities, they “are the only local media.”  \nECF No. 32 (“Mintz Decl.”) ¶ 2.   \nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (“CPB”) is a congressionally authorized non-\nprofit corporation and “the steward of the federal government’s investment in public broadcast-\ning.”  Mintz Decl. ¶ 1; see Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, 47 U.S.C. § 396.  It is “the largest \nsingle source of funding” for public radio, television, and other networks, and most of its allocated \nbudget “goes directly to more than 1,500 public media stations across the country.”  Mintz Decl. \n¶¶ 1–2.  Apart from distributing congressionally appropriated funds, CPB administers “two sets of \n \n1 See https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R48363/R48363.4.pdf. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 3 of 22\nfederal grants,” including the Next Generation Warning System (“NGWS”) grant program.  Id. \n¶¶ 2, 9.   \nThe NGWS grant program is a 36-month program authorized by Congress that “makes \nFederal funds available” to allow broadcasting stations “to improve the resilience and security” of \ntheir emergency alert systems.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 10; ECF No. 31-2 at 26–27.  Congress appropriated \n$40 million to FEMA to implement the NGWS grant in 2022, and FEMA selected CPB to admin-\nister that grant by distributing sub-awards to local public broadcasting stations.  See Pub. L. 117-\n103, 136 Stat. 328 (Mar. 15, 2022); ECF No. 31-2 at 29; Mintz Decl. ¶¶ 9–15, 21.  The “perfor-\nmance period” under the 2022 NGWS grant expires on September 30, 2025.  ECF No. 31-2 (“Slav-\nitt Decl.”) ¶ 2; ECF No. 32 at 33, 52.  FEMA has, however, awarded additional NGWS grants to \nCPB based on funds Congress appropriated for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025.  Mintz Decl. \n¶¶ 23, 69; Slavitt Decl. ¶ 1; ECF No. 34-1 (“Supp. Slavitt Decl.”) ¶ 8. \nFEMA makes those grants on a “cost reimbursement basis,” meaning “CPB accrues liabil-\nities” for the costs of hiring staff dedicated to the program and “for costs incurred or expenditures \nmade by the sub-awardees.”  Slavitt Decl. ¶ 4.  Specifically, CPB issues sub-awards to public \nbroadcasting stations who buy the “necessary equipment to enhance their” emergency alert sys-\ntems and then “submit reimbursement requests to CPB.”  Id.; Mintz Decl. ¶¶ 24, 60.  Sub-awardees \nare “not required to match” the award “with any amount of” their own “funds.”  Mintz Decl. ¶ 25.  \nTo “process” the station’s reimbursement requests, “CPB accesses FEMA’s Payment and Report-\ning System (“PARS”)” and “draw[s] for that reimbursement,” usually once a month.  Id. ¶¶ 18, \n29, 31.  FEMA, in turn, “typically issues payment to CPB through PARS within two business \ndays.”  Id. ¶ 31.  When the 2022 NGWS grant expires on September 30, sub-awardees have 3 \nmonths—and CPB has 4—to submit final requests for reimbursement to FEMA.  ECF No. 32 at \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 4 of 22\n52. \nIn awarding the grant, FEMA recognized the importance of “extending the reach and qual-\nity of IPAWS alerts.”  Mintz Decl. ¶ 17; ECF No. 32 at 151.  The NGWS program, it explained, \nwould “enable[] broadcasters in rural and underserved communities to acquire . . . potentially life-\nsaving technology when cost concerns might otherwise discourage or delay adoption.”  ECF No. \n32 at 139.  Indeed, some equipment currently used by CPB’s sub-awardees is “in disrepair,” “in-\neligible for maintenance,” and “at the end of its life.”  E.g., ECF No. 31-4 ¶¶ 10–11 (describing \n20-year-old transmitter); ECF No. 31-8 ¶ 13 (describing 23-year-old transmitter); ECF No. 31-12 \n¶ 16–17 (describing 50-year-old generator).  If those critical components were to “fail,” some sta-\ntions could no longer “broadcast emergency alerts.”  E.g., ECF No. 31-8 ¶ 15; ECF No. 31-11 \n¶ 19; ECF No. 31-12 ¶ 32. \nFor instance, one radio station serving rural parts of Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky—areas \nprone to severe weather—“constantly faces the possibility of being permanently off the air” be-\ncause it relies on a transmitter that is “15 years old and already failing to broadcast at optimal \npower.”  ECF No. 31-5 ¶¶ 5–17.  Like many other stations, it is “unable” to buy a new transmitter \n“without the NGWS grant funds.”  Id. ¶ 22.  Another station serving mountainous parts of New \nYork and Pennsylvania is “often the only source of real-time emergency information” in the region \nand uses a 15-year-old transmitter that could fail “[a]t any time.”  ECF No. 31-6 ¶¶ 5–12.  The \nstation has a backup battery that could last two hours; once that time runs out, so does the station’s \nability to broadcast emergency alerts.  Id. ¶ 15.  Pleas to “local and state governments for funding \nassistance” have gone unanswered.  Id. ¶ 16.  So the equipment these stations seek to replace using \nthe NGWS grant is important to their ongoing ability to continue issuing emergency alerts.  Still, \naccording to CPB, “the majority of work under the 2022 NGWS Grant has yet to be completed.”  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 5 of 22\nSlavitt Decl. ¶ 9.  To date, CPB has “drawn down” only about $4 million of the appropriated $40 \nmillion.  ECF No. 34-3 at 10. \nB.  FEMA’s Challenged Actions and This Lawsuit \nOn February 19, 2025, CPB accessed PARS to submit a reimbursement request.  Slavitt \nDecl. ¶ 13.  But PARS said the funds were on “hold.”  Id.; see ECF No. 32 at 251–54.  So CPB \ncould not request any reimbursement, “leaving public media stations across the country with hun-\ndreds of thousands of dollars of unreimbursed expenses.”  Mintz Decl. ¶ 33.  The same day, CPB \nissued a Notice of Stop Work—the first of its kind—explaining that it could not access the grant \nfunds and was “seeking clarification” from FEMA “on this situation” and directing all sub-award-\nees “to pause any further commitment of funds.”  ECF No. 32 at 256; Mintz Decl. ¶ 35.  CPB sent \na formal letter to FEMA demanding that access to the funding be restored but got no response.  \nMintz Decl. ¶¶ 36–37.  About a week later, FEMA notified all its grant recipients via email that \nthe agency was “taking swift action to ensure the alignment of its programs with Secretary Noem’s \ndirection” and, to that end, was “conducting additional reviews of allocations before releasing \nfunds for all grants.”  ECF No. 32 at 264; Mintz Decl. ¶ 38.  That “manual review” process could \n“take up to 30 days,” FEMA said.  ECF No. 32 at 264.  It also required grant recipients to provide \n“additional information” it had never asked for in the past.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 39.  But when CPB tried \nto comply—because FEMA stated it would not process any requests absent that information—the \n“hold” on the PARS system meant “no information could actually be entered, much less submitted \nto FEMA.”  Id. ¶¶ 39–40.  CPB reached out to its designated FEMA representatives, but no one \nexplained “why the ‘hold’ was in place” or “how the situation could be resolved.”  Id. ¶ 40. \nSo, on March 13, CPB sued FEMA and one of its administrators, arguing that FEMA’s \ndecision to place a “hold” in the PARS portal and preventing CPB from submitting reimbursement \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 6 of 22\nrequests was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  ECF No. 1 at 21–23.  The same day, CPB moved for \na temporary restraining order directing the agency to remove the “hold” and resume processing its \nreimbursement requests.  ECF No. 4.  On March 17, the Court denied the motion because CPB \nhad not shown that it would suffer any irreparable harm, much less irreparable harm that would \noccur so soon that a temporary restraining order was necessary to remedy it.  ECF No. 17. \nA few days later, FEMA “provide[d] an alternative submission platform, in the form of the \n[non-disaster] Grants Portal,” though it did not then restore CPB’s access to the PARS system.  \nMintz Decl. ¶ 42.  That portal, however, allowed only “a single expense submission to be pro-\ncessed at any given time,” which caused “significant[] delay[]” on CPB’s end given the number of \n“expenses” it incurs “each month.”  Id. ¶ 43 (emphasis omitted).   \nFEMA’s “manual review” process remained intact.  So CPB again reached out to ask “what \nspecific additional information” the agency needed “to process NGWS expenses” but received \nnothing “substantive[]” in response.  Slavitt Decl. ¶ 18.  Instead, on March 19, FEMA issued “gen-\neralized ‘guidance’” to all grantees explaining that its “additional reviews” would “ensure funds \nare disbursed appropriately while continuing to support and prioritize communities and disaster \nsurvivors.”  Id.; ECF No. 32 at 269.  More, FEMA also asked grant recipients for “details” on \nwhether their “work or mission involve[d] supporting aliens” and whether “the payment request \ninclude[d] an activity involving support to aliens.”  ECF No. 32 at 270.  As part of its manual \nreview process, FEMA also “asked for information about CPB’s staff costs duplicative of” what \nCPB had already submitted.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 47.   \nOn April 21, FEMA ended its manual review process.  Citing several orders issued by the \ndistrict court in New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39 (D.R.I.), FEMA explained it would, “[e]ffective \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 7 of 22\nimmediately,” “resume processing grant payment requests and obligations using the same pro-\ncesses and procedures it was using prior to the implementation of the manual review process.”  \nMintz Decl. ¶ 49; ECF No. 32 at 276.2  “FEMA returned functionality” to the PARS portal the \nnext day—though not without first being prompted to do so by CPB’s counsel—and CPB submit-\nted its reimbursement requests.  Mintz Decl. ¶¶ 50–51; Slavitt Decl. ¶ 27.  FEMA processed all \nrequests consistent with its “pre-February protocols” and paid CPB about $1.2 million.  Mintz \nDecl. ¶ 51.  It was the first time in “over two months” that FEMA “prompt[ly] process[ed]” reim-\nbursement requests.  Slavitt Decl. ¶ 27. \nThe period of normalcy was short-lived.  According to CPB, on May 13, “[l]ess than three \nweeks after restoring PARS’ functionality,” FEMA “abruptly” and without explanation “disabled \nCPB’s ability to submit” reimbursement requests.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 52; Slavitt Decl. ¶¶ 32–33.  In-\ndeed, FEMA did so “less than 24 hours” after its counsel “requested that CPB dismiss” this case \nbecause the agency had resumed processing and paying the NGWS grant expenses.  Slavitt Decl. \n¶¶ 32–33.  What happened?  FEMA wouldn’t say.  Id. ¶ 34.  Indeed, FEMA’s counsel had no \ninformation at all “about what FEMA was doing or why.”  ECF No. 31-3 (“Lipchitz Decl.”) ¶ 22.  \n \n2 In that case, several states and the District of Columbia sued President Trump, the Office \nof Management and Budget, and several agencies—including FEMA—to challenge the Execu-\ntive’s decision to temporarily freeze all federal funding programs to review them “for consistency \nwith current presidential policy.”  New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39 (D.R.I. Jan. 28, 2025), ECF \nNo.  1  at  3.    The  court  temporarily  prohibited  the  defendants  from  “paus[ing],  freez[ing], \nimped[ing], block[ing], cancel[ing], or terminat[ing]” disbursement of appropriated federal funds \nunder awarded grants, executed contracts, or other executed financial obligations.  ECF No. 50 at \n11.  On March 6, the court issued a preliminarily injunction along similar lines.  ECF No. 161.  \nLater that month, the plaintiffs moved to enforce the preliminary injunction, arguing that FEMA’s \nmanual review process violated the court’s order by effectively freezing obligated funds.  ECF No. \n168.  The court agreed.  “The record ma[de] clear that FEMA’s manual review process impose[d] \nan indefinite pause on the disbursement of federal funds to the States,” it said on April 4.  ECF \nNo. 175 at 14.  Thus, the court ordered FEMA to “cease the challenged manual review process.”  \nId.    \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 8 of 22\nWhen the parties spoke again a few days later, counsel informed CPB that “all” he could “say” \nwas “that FEMA [had] not re-started the manual review process, and other grant recipients are \nnow being paid, but CPB is not.”  Id. ¶ 24.  So, on May 15, CPB issued another Stop Work Order \nto all sub-awardees “to prevent further incursion of costs.”  Supp. Slavitt Decl. ¶ 15.   \nA few days later, CPB asked the Court to enter a preliminary-injunction briefing schedule.  \nECF No. 25.  But on the eve of the deadline for CPB’s motion, FEMA changed course again.  That \nis, on June 5, FEMA’s counsel emailed CPB bearing “good news”: the agency was “turning the \npayments back on for CPB,” and CPB would “be able to submit its payments by end of day to-\nmorrow,” at the latest.  ECF No. 31-3 at 92; Lipchitz Decl. ¶ 26.  And FEMA indeed reopened the \nPARS portal on June 6.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 61; ECF No. 33-1 (“Breslin Decl.”) ¶ 11.3  But it was not \nwilling to “stipulate” that it would keep the PARS system “‘open’ to CPB” or give “advance no-\ntice” of any future portal closure.  ECF No. 31-3 at 90–91.   \nSo on June 12, CPB moved for a preliminary injunction requiring FEMA “to keep” the \nPARS portal “open” and to “provide at least 30 days’ notice . . . prior to any future closure.”  ECF \nNo. 30 at 2; ECF No. 31-20 at 2.  The Court held a hearing on June 30, 2025.  Then and now, the \nPARS portal remains open.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 61; ECF No. 33-1 (“Breslin Decl.”) ¶ 11.  And as of \nJune 12, CPB has “withdr[awn] an additional $239,553.77” in reimbursements.”  Mintz Decl. ¶ 61.  \n \n3 FEMA now explains that it temporarily “turned off” CPB’s “ability to draw down NGWS \nfunds” when it “began a policy review of the NGWS grant program” to “ensure compliance with” \nExecutive Order 14290, Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media (May 1, 2025).  Breslin \nDecl. ¶¶ 8–9.  That Order “directs federal agencies to identify and terminate, to the maximum \nextent consistent with applicable law, any direct or indirect funding of National Public Radio and \nthe Public Broadcasting Service,” E.O. 14290 § 3(a), and CPB “issue[s] subgrants to public broad-\ncasting entities” affiliated with these entities, Breslin Decl. ¶¶ 8–9.  FEMA restored CPB’s ability \n“to draw down funds,” though it “continues to review the NGWS grant program to ensure that the \nprogram’s design effectively serves its statutory purpose, program goals, and agency priorities.”  \nId. ¶¶ 10–11. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 9 of 22\nFEMA also represented at the hearing that it paid CPB another $834,000 on June 13.  CPB’s May \n15 Stop Work Order, however, “remain[s] in effect” because, CPB says, it cannot “assur[e]” its \n“subgrantees that their expenses will be reimbursed” given the “extended periods of uncertainty.”  \nSupp. Slavitt Decl. ¶ 15.4   \nII.  Legal Standard \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction \n“must make a ‘clear showing’ that four factors, taken together, warrant relief: likely success on the \nmerits, likely irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, a balance of the equities in his \nfavor, and accord with the public interest.”  Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 505 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22).  But “a court need not necessarily consider each \nprong to deny relief.”  Ass’n for Educ. Fin. & Pol’y, Inc. v. McMahon, No. 25-cv-00999 (TNM), \n2025 WL 1568301, at *3 (D.D.C. June 3, 2025).  “[F]ailure to show any irreparable harm,” stand-\ning alone, is “grounds for refusing to issue a preliminary injunction, even if the other three factors \nentering the calculus merit such relief.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d \n290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nBecause preliminary injunctive relief is such an “extraordinary remedy,” it may not issue \n“based only on a possibility of irreparable harm.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis added) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  Consistent with that mandate, the D.C. Circuit “has set a high stand-\nard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297.  One, “the injury \n \n4 After CPB moved for a preliminary injunction, it also submitted “a formal request” to \nFEMA to extend the “Period of Performance” for the 2022 NGWS grant program by fifteen \nmonths, until December 31, 2026.  ECF No. 34-3.  At the time of the hearing, FEMA was consid-\nering but had not yet responded to the request. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 10 of 22\nmust be both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”  Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 \nF.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  Put another way, “[t]he party seeking injunctive \nrelief must show that the injury complained of is of such imminence that there is a clear and present \nneed for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Two, the injury must truly \nbe “irreparable”—that is, “beyond remediation.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d \nat 297.   \nIII.  Analysis \nThe Court’s analysis begins and ends with CPB’s failure to meet the high bar for showing \nirreparable harm.5  FEMA restored CPB’s access to PARS in early June and has been reimbursing \nCPB for the expenses of sub-awardees since then.  With the portal now open—and for over a \nmonth—CPB cannot show that the preliminary injunction it requests is necessary to avoid immi-\nnent irreparable harm. \nCPB relies on three theories of irreparable harm.  First, CPB contends that the “repeated” \nportal closures frustrate its “mission” to “effectuate” the NGWS grant.  ECF No. 31-1 at 32, 34.  \nIt argues that FEMA’s back-and-forth over whether “it will allow CPB to submit NGWS expenses” \nhas sown chaos, and both CPB and its sub-awardees need assurances that they will be reimbursed \nfor the costs they incur.  Id. at 35.  Second, CPB argues that FEMA’s conduct “endanger[s] the \n \n5 FEMA has not asserted that its reopening of the PARS portal has mooted this case, and it \ndisclaimed any such argument at the hearing.  The Court must, however, independently “assure \n[itself] of jurisdiction.”  City of N.Y. v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 776 F.3d 11, 14 (D.C. Cir. \n2015).  A case is moot either “when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a \nlegally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969).  \nWhile CPB sued to challenge FEMA’s closure of a portal that the agency has now re-opened, the \n“voluntary cessation” doctrine keeps this case alive.  Under that doctrine, a party’s decision to stop \nthe “challenged conduct” renders a case moot only if it can show that it is “absolutely clear [that] \nthe allegedly wrongful behavior [cannot] reasonably be expected to recur.”  Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. \nFERC, 92 F.4th 1124, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  FEMA has not sought to make \nthat showing. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 11 of 22\nsafety and lives of citizens who rely on the emergency alert system.”  Id. at 37.  And third, it asserts \nthat FEMA is damaging CPB’s reputation and goodwill, as “many stations and the public at large \nare greatly concerned about [its] ability to reimburse the sub-awardees.”  Id. at 38.  But none of \nthem help CPB establish irreparable harm. \nA.  CPB Has Not Shown That Its Requested Preliminary Injunction Would Pre-\nvent Any Irreparable Harm To its Organizational Mission \nCPB’s leading theory focuses on harm to its organizational mission.  CPB’s “primary pur-\npose,” it argues, is “to ensure the proper procurement of, and payment for, critical infrastructure \nfor the national emergency alert system under the NGWS Grants.”  ECF No. 31-1 at 34.  But it \ncannot “accomplish” that mission before the NGWS grant expires in September “[i]f FEMA does \nnot reopen the PARS portal in time[] and does not keep the portal open.”  Id. at 35.  CPB adds that \nFEMA “has” already “frustrated” CPB’s mission by closing PARS, which forced many stations to \npause installations and other work orders, id. at 34–36, and that the “instability” resulting from \nFEMA’s “shifting conduct” has made CPB’s sub-awardees unwilling “to incur significant new \nexpenses” absent assurances that they will be reimbursed, id. at 33, 35.  \nCPB’s mission-based theory of harm falters for several reasons.  To be sure, actions that \n“unquestionably make it more difficult” for an organization “to accomplish [its] primary mission” \ncan sometimes constitute irreparable harm warranting preliminary relief.  League of Women Voters \nof United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  But invoking harm to an organizational \nmission is no end-run around the demanding test for irreparable harm.  The threatened injury that \nthe proposed preliminary injunction would address must still be “certain and great, actual and not \ntheoretical, and so imminent that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.”  Id. at 7–8 \n(cleaned up and citation omitted).  And, of course, it must be irremediable.  Id. at 8.  CPB has not \nmet these requirements, no matter how the Court parses its theory. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 12 of 22\nTo begin, the disconnect between CPB’s harm-to-mission argument and the status quo is \nglaring: much of CPB’s theory appears premised on the PARS portal being closed.  See ECF No. \n31-1 at 34–35.  Fleshed out, CPB’s theory goes like this: its mission, CPB says, is to “effectuate \nthe NGWS Grants” by “procur[ing]” and “pay[ing]” for “critical” emergency-alert-system “infra-\nstructure” updates.  Id. at 34.  That mission, in turn, depends on sub-awardees “order[ing] and \npay[ing] for the parts and services in time to submit those reimbursement requests to CPB,” so that \nCPB can then submit them to FEMA.  Id. at 35.  All that must happen “before the NGWS Grant \nexpires [at the end of] September 2025,” but “these actions . . . cannot be taken” if PARS is closed.  \nId.  And, indeed, virtually all sub-awardee declarants assert that they were forced to halt their \nsystem upgrades when FEMA closed PARS, with many explaining that these upgrades might not \nhappen at all if FEMA does not reopen the system.  See, e.g., ECF No. 31-4 ¶ 24 (“BRPT believes \nthat if the fund freeze continues until August, it will not be able to complete the transmitter up-\ngrades in time to comply with its NGWS grant . . . .”); ECF No. 31-5 ¶ 24 (“Given the funds hold, \nhowever, WNIN has not yet moved forward purchasing and installing this new equipment.”).6 \n \n6 See also ECF No. 31-6 ¶ 23 (“As a result of the current closure of the reimbursement \nportal . . . Radio Caskill has not moved forward with the installation of the new transmitter.”); ECF \nNo. 31-7 ¶ 15 (“KRCL does not believe that it would be able to complete its upgrades in time to \ncomply with these deadlines if the funding hold continues.”); ECF No. 31-8 ¶ 21 (“Without reim-\nbursement, and given the funds hold, KEDT has been forced to delay order, purchase, and instal-\nlation of other components of its NGWS upgrade . . . .”); ECF No. 31-9 ¶ 24 (“As a result of \nFEMA’s hold on the NGWS grant funds, WDCQ has been unable to move forward with installa-\ntion of the new transmitter . . . .”); ECF No. 31-10 ¶ 13 (“The current hold on funds has placed \n[KMXT’s] investment in jeopardy and created fiscal strain on [its] limited operational budget.”); \nECF No. 31-11 ¶ 21 (“Because of the repeated FEMA holds SVETC has not yet moved forward \nwith ordering and installing a replacement transmitter and accompanying equipment.”); ECF No. \n31-12 ¶ 23 (“As a result of the disruption in funding, KTOO had to ask its contractor to pause its \norder for a generator[.]”); ECF No. 31-13 ¶ 18 (“Given the funds hold, however, KMOS has not \nmoved forward with installation of the antenna.”); ECF No. 31-14 ¶ 26 (“Given the funds hold, \nhowever, CRP has not yet moved forward with installation of the transmitter . . . .”); ECF No. 31-\n15 ¶ 21 (“As a result of the disruption of funding, KHNS has not moved forward with the \n \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 13 of 22\nBut to repeat the obvious: CPB’s problem—if you can call it that—is that the PARS portal \nhas been open for over a month, and FEMA has been processing CPB’s reimbursement requests \nduring that time.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 51; Breslin Decl. ¶ 11.  For the most part, then, CPB’s sub-awardee \ndeclarations about the effect of a closed portal are stale.  And CPB’s claims that FEMA is \n“run[ning] out the clock on the 2022 NGWS Grant” and preventing it from “implement[ing]” that \ngrant are entirely disconnected from where events stand now—and even where they stood when \nCPB filed its motion.  ECF No. 31-1 at 35–36.  So at this point, CPB’s irreparable-harm argument \nmust rely on the risk that FEMA will shut PARS again. \nBefore the Court turns to why the threat of a future PARS shutdown is not enough to show \nirreparable harm to CPB’s mission, though, it pauses to explain why CPB has not shown, based \non any injury stemming from events that have already happened, that its proposed preliminary \ninjunction is warranted.  To be sure, CPB has shown that FEMA’s handling of the portal earlier \nthis year caused its sub-awardees to press pause on certain upgrades.  And because part of CPB’s \ndeclared mission hinges on its sub-awardees completing those upgrades, CPB has also shown that \nFEMA—at least for some time—made it more difficult for CPB to fulfill that mission.  But “the \npurpose of a preliminary injunction” is “not to remedy a past wrong.”  Achagzai v. Broad. Bd. of \nGovernors, No. 14-cv-768 (RDM), 2016 WL 471274, at *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2016).  So any past \ninjury CPB suffered because of “obstacles” FEMA once placed in its path of administering the \nNGWS grants, but that are now removed, does not justify preliminary injunctive relief. \n \ninstallation of the equipment it has purchased . . . .”); ECF No. 31-16 ¶ 12 (“KRBW has not been \nreimbursed for [the cost of new equipment] and was informed by the CPB that all funds have been \nplaced on a hold by FEMA.”); ECF No. 31-17 ¶ 27 (“All Stations have been informed by CPB \nthat all subgrant funds have been placed on hold by FEMA.”); ECF No. 31-18 ¶ 11 (similar). \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 14 of 22\nTo be sure, CPB could also contend that these past events will injure its organizational \nmission going forward, even if the PARS portal remains open and apart from any threat of it clos-\ning again, because the 2022 NGWS grant expires at the end of September.  CPB does not seem to \nargue this point explicitly, but some sub-awardees say that they may be unable to complete their \nupgrades in time because they “missed [their] window of opportunity” because FEMA closed \nPARS.  ECF No. 31-15 ¶ 25; see also 31-13 ¶ 26.  For example, one was forced to pause installa-\ntion of an antenna when FEMA closed the portal and now cannot proceed “for the remainder of \nthe year” because the “Installation Company . . . has a full schedule with other contracts signed.”  \nECF No. 31-13 ¶¶ 18–26.  Unless it “can somehow fit [the station] back into their schedule,” the \nsub-awardee explains, the antenna installation will not “be completed before” the NGWS grant \nexpires in September 2025.  Id. ¶ 26.  And with the sub-awardees unable to upgrade their systems \nin time because of these past portal closures, the argument would go, CPB will suffer irreparable \nharm to its mission of administering the grant program.  But such injury would hardly be imminent \nand certain, given that FEMA is considering CPB’s pending request to extend the program’s per-\nformance period past the end of September.  See ECF No. 34-3.  More to the point, the preliminary \ninjunction requested by CPB—ordering FEMA to keep PARS open—would not prevent any injury \nthat stems only from past closures and the end-of-September deadline. \nThus, as mentioned above, what is left of CPB’s theory—now that the PARS portal is up \nand running again—is that it is facing future irreparable harm to its mission because of the threat \nthat FEMA will shut down PARS again.  But CPB fails to meet its burden on this theory as well. \nA party seeking preliminary relief must show “that irreparable injury is likely”—not just \n“possible”—“in the absence of an injunction.”  Singh v. McConville, 187 F. Supp. 3d 152, 160 \n(D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22) (emphasis in original).  Mere “uncertainty” is not \n  14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 15 of 22\nenough, and a court will “interven[e] to prevent potential injury from prospective government \nmisconduct” only when “such misconduct is imminent.”  Id. at 163 (quoting Halkin v. Helms, 690 \nF.2d 977, 1005 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  To the extent that CPB’s organizational harm theory turns on a \nshowing that FEMA will likely close the PARS portal again, CPB has not met its burden.  It offers \nno reason to think it will, other than nodding to what happened in the past.  And again, the portal \nhas now been open for over a month, and FEMA has been processing CPB’s reimbursement re-\nquests.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 51; Breslin Decl. ¶ 11.  Is it “possible” that FEMA might press pause on \nPARS?  Of course.  But CPB does not show that it will likely do so. \nCPB also might argue that the mere threat of closure under these circumstances (whatever \nits likelihood) is likely to cause irreparable harm to its mission.  Indeed, on CPB’s telling, FEMA’s \npast actions have caused such “chaos” and uncertainty that, even now, “no business is willing to \nincur significant new expenses” unless FEMA guarantees that it will permit reimbursement.  ECF \nNo. 31-1 at 35–36; e.g., ECF No. 31-4 ¶ 27.  CPB does not elaborate.  Presumably, though, the \ntheory is this: again, CPB’s mission is to administer the NGWS grant; to carry it out, sub-awardees \nmust complete upgrades and seek reimbursement from CPB.  But its sub-awardees are unwilling \nto do their part with the threat of future portal closures—and unreimbursed expenses—looming \nover their head.  CPB, then, can fulfill its mission only if the Court orders FEMA to keep PARS \nopen.7 \nStill, this theory of irreparable harm comes up well short.  CPB has not shown that its sub-\nawardees are likely to fail to upgrade their infrastructure and seek reimbursement from CPB, nor \n \n7 As noted, CPB’s proposed preliminary-injunction order also asks for FEMA to give it 30 \ndays’ notice and an explanation for any future portal closure.  ECF No. 30 at 2; ECF No. 31-20 at \n2.  As far as the Court can tell, though, CPB’s proposed injunction would not permit FEMA to \nclose PARS without asking the Court to lift the injunction.  So CPB’s requested relief is, at bottom, \na prohibition on any future portal closure without the Court’s permission. \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 16 of 22\nthat that FEMA is the reason some might not do so.  And even if CPB could show as much, any \nharm to its organizational mission would still not be great enough to meet the requirements for \nirreparable harm.  \n  One preliminary point: ordinarily, a plaintiff cannot loop in harm suffered by third parties \nto obtain a preliminary injunction.  Cardinal Health, Inc. v. Holder, 846 F. Supp. 2d 203, 213 \n(D.D.C. 2012).  CPB toes that line because the gist of its claim is that sub-awardees—not CPB \nitself—risk incurring expenses that they cannot reimburse if PARS shuts down again.  ECF No. \n33 at 21–22; ECF No. 31-1 at 35–36.  But, as explained, CPB describes its mission as dependent \non the sub-awardees making those necessary purchases.  So although CPB walks a tightrope, this \npotential injury to the sub-awardees could injure CPB too, at least in theory.  But not on the record \nhere. \nStart with the likelihood that CPB’s sub-awardees will not move forward with their system \nupgrades.  CPB’s factual showing on that score is inadequate to meet its burden.  It suggests that \nits sub-awardees are not “willing to incur significant new expenses” given the threat of portal \nclosure.  ECF No. 31-1 at 35.  And for support, CPB cites several sub-awardee declarations that \nmake the following identical assertion: “without assurances that the portal will remain open,” they \nare “reluctant to move forward with new NGWS grant expenditures, because of the uncertainty \nthat FEMA’s actions of repeatedly closing the portal without notice or explanation have caused.”  \nE.g., ECF No. 31-4 ¶ 27 (emphasis added).  But for CPB’s theory of organizational mission-based \nharm to pan out, the sub-awardees must be more than reluctant to make the upgrades.  Rather, they \nmust be unlikely to make them.  And, as FEMA rejoins, “saying one is ‘reluctant to move forward’ \nis a far cry from saying that [one] will not move forward.”  ECF No. 33 at 24.  That alone is enough \nto dispense with CPB’s claim of irreparable harm to its organizational mission. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 17 of 22\nSecond, CPB has not shown that any organizational harm from the sub-awardees failing to \nmove forward would “directly result” from a threat that FEMA will close the portal.  Wis. Gas \nCo., 758 F.2d at 674 (“[T]he movant must show that the alleged harm will directly result from the \naction which the movant seeks to enjoin”).  Surprisingly—at least to the Court—CPB’s May 15 \nStop Work Order apparently remains in effect.  So the sub-awardees cannot implement any up-\ngrade plans, no matter how each may independently assess the situation.  Thus, at this point, any \nharm to CPB caused by a sub-awardee’s failure to move ahead is self-inflicted, and therefore does \nnot “satisfy the irreparable harm criterion.”  Safari Club Int’l v. Jewell, 47 F. Supp. 3d 29, 33 \n(D.D.C. 2014) (citation omitted). \nThird, even assuming some sub-awardees are not likely to complete planned upgrades by \nthe end of September, CPB has not shown that any related harm to its mission would be significant \nenough to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.  That is so in part because CPB’s mission is much \nbroader than administering the NGWS grant or, in CPB’s words, “procur[ing]” and “pay[ing] for[] \ncritical infrastructure for the national emergency alert system.”   ECF No. 31-1 at 34.  No doubt, \nadministering the grant program is one of CPB’s tasks.  See Mintz Decl. ¶ 2.  But it is not all CPB \ndoes.  Quite the opposite—on its own account and on that of Congress.  CPB’s declarant explains \nCPB was established in 1967—when there was no emergency alert system, let alone federal grants \nto update it—to become “the steward of the federal government’s investment in public broadcast-\ning.”  Id. ¶ 1.  So CPB’s “mission,” even he says, is sweeping: “to ensure universal access to non-\ncommercial, high-quality content and telecommunications services.”  Id. ¶ 2.  Or, as Congress put \nit, “to facilitate the development of public telecommunications” and “make” such “services avail-\nable” and “access[ible]” to “all citizens of the United States.”  47 U.S.C. §§ 396(a)(7), (9)–(10); \nsee ECF No. 31-1 at 36–37.  And CPB does that by “distributing” Congressionally “appropriated \n  17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 18 of 22\nfunds” to “public media stations across the country”—funds that have nothing to do with the \nNGWS grant program or the emergency alert system.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 2.  That program, as CPB \nsays itself, is one of “two sets of federal grants” that it administers “[i]n addition to” disbursing \nappropriated funds.  Id. (emphasis added).  In other words, implementing the NGWS grant pro-\ngram—which CPB says FEMA is making harder—appears to be but a slice of CPB’s mission, as \nopposed to its “primary” one.  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 9.  So even assuming that, \nwithout preliminary injunctive relief, some unknown number of sub-awardees will not update their \nemergency-alert systems before the 2022 NGWS grant expires, CPB has not shown that any harm \nto its sweeping organizational mission would be “great” enough to qualify as irreparable harm.  \nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297 (citation omitted).8  On top of that, even if \nCPB’s mission were as narrow as it suggests, it is still hard to see how any harm resulting from a \nless-than-full implementation of the 2022 NGWS grant would be great and certain, let alone both.  \nAfter all, CPB has three other NGWS grants for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025 that will permit \nit to “procur[e]” and “pay[] for” infrastructure upgrades.  ECF No. 31-1 at 34; Mintz Decl. ¶¶ 23, \n69; Supp. Slavitt Decl. ¶ 8.   \nIn the end, “CPB and the NGWS sub-awardees” want “stability and predictability.”  ECF \nNo. 31-1 at 35.  That is understandable.  But “instability and unpredictability” are not, as CPB \n \n8 For this and other reasons, CPB’s reliance on League of Women Voters is misplaced.  ECF \nNo. 31-1 at 34–35.  There, an organization faced irreparable harm to its “primary mission of reg-\nistering voters” if a proof-of-citizenship requirement remained on voter-registration forms, “be-\ncause after the registration deadlines for” an imminent “election pass[ed],” there could “be no do \nover and no redress.”  838 F.3d at 9 (cleaned up and citation omitted).  That case is very different \nfrom this one, even putting aside that administrating the NGWS grant program is not CPB’s pri-\nmary mission.  CPB has not made a similar showing that harm to its mission is likely. Nor can \nCPB point to a similar certain and imminent deadline after which any harm would be irremediable \nbecause FEMA is considering CPB’s pending request to extend the program’s performance period \npast the end of September.  See ECF No. 34-3. \n \n  18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 19 of 22\nsuggests, sufficient to find irreparable harm.  Id. at 33 (quoting Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, \nNo. 25-cv-1248, 2025 WL 1525376, at *14 (D.D.C. May 29, 2025)).  Much more is required, and \nthe main case that CPB relies on proves the point.  In Learning Resources, two small toy companies \nchallenged President Trump’s imposition of sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, which were “so \nhigh as to effectively prevent” them from importing any goods.  2025 WL 1525376, at *4–5.  The \ncompanies could not “possibly absorb the costs of increased tariffs” and could be forced to “sig-\nnificantly scale back operations,” “close facilities,” and “possibly sell their businesses.”  Id. at *13.  \nOn top of that, their “financial recovery” would be “limited to the value of any tariffs they \nwrongly” paid; the companies could never “recover lost profits, lost customers, or the additional \ncosts of finding replacements for high-tariff imports.”  Id. at *14 (cleaned up).  Those plaintiffs, \nJudge  Contreras  found,  met  their  burden  of  showing  irreparable  harm  “because  the  tariffs \n. . . pose[d] an existential threat to their business.”  Id. at *13.  Nothing similarly threatens CPB’s \nexistence or, for the sake of argument, its mission.  And unlike here, the plaintiffs in that case met \ntheir burden of showing an injury that was certain, great, imminent, irremediable, and directly \ncaused by the challenged action. \nOn this record, CPB has not shown irreparable harm to its organizational mission stemming \nfrom the threat of a future portal closure.  Indeed, the Court is unaware of any court finding irrep-\narable harm on a theory and a record akin to that advanced here. \nB.  CPB’s Other Theories of Irreparable Harm to the Public and Its Reputation \nFail as Well  \nCPB presses two other theories of irreparable harm, but they fail as well, partly for reasons \nnow familiar, and partly for others explained below.9     \n \n9 CPB’s motion also gestures at “nine employees who are fully or partly funded through \nthe NGWS Grant” whose salaries CPB pays and then reimburses through PARS, ECF No. 31-1 at \n \n  19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 20 of 22\nIts second theory—that FEMA’s conduct “endanger[s] the safety and lives of citizens who \nrely on the emergency alert system,” ECF No. 31-1 at 37—stumbles at the starting gate because \nany harm to the public is not CPB’s own.  See City of Moundridge v. Exxon Mobile Corp., 429 F. \nSupp. 2d 117, 129 (D.D.C. 2006) (preliminary injunction movants must “demonstrate[e] irrepara-\nble harm to themselves”).  And it is speculative because it relies on a causal chain of events that \non this record are merely possibilities, not probabilities.   \nCPB’s third theory—that FEMA’s actions “have harmed, and continue to harm,” its repu-\ntation—fares no better.  ECF No. 31-1 at 38.  For one thing, any purported reputational damage \nthat CPB suffered when PARS was closed is a “past harm” that, as explained, does not justify \nforward-looking relief.  Brookens v. Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., 315 F. Supp. 3d 561, 567 (D.D.C. \n2018) (citation omitted).  And as for any prospective harm to its reputation, especially given that \nthe PARS portal is open, CPB has not made the required “concrete and corroborated” showing.   \nCardinal Health, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 2d at 213 (citation omitted). \nCPB vaguely gestures at “business and grant partners” losing “faith in CPB’s ability to \nadminister” the grant.  ECF No. 31-1 at 38.  But while the record shows that sub-awardees “have \nexpressed their frustration with CPB,” and CPB’s relationship with them has been “strained,” the \nsub-awardees  complain, at  bottom, about  “instability” that “FEMA has created”  and  blame \n“FEMA” for the “repeated disruptions.”  Mintz Decl. ¶¶ 70–73 (emphasis added); Slavitt Decl. \n \n24, and CPB’s declarant contends that “[t]he holds and significant delays” forced CPB “into the \nposition of likely furloughing or terminating” them “by July,” Mintz Decl. ¶ 79.  But CPB con-\nfirmed at the hearing that it is not advancing a theory of irreparable harm based on any terminations \nthat it said were “likely” when the portal was closed.  For good reason: with the portal now open, \nany claim that CPB might have to furlough or fire employees is pure speculation, especially when \nit was not forced to do so when PARS was closed.  It is also the type of “economic loss” that does \nnot qualify as irreparable harm.  Indiana v. Haaland, No. 24-cv-1665 (RBW), 2024 WL 5213401, \nat *11 (D.D.C. Dec. 24, 2024) (citation omitted).  \n  20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 21 of 22\n¶¶ 56, 59–60.  Little suggests that the sub-awardees fault CPB for any such disruptions, which \nwere of course outside its control.  See ECF No. 32 at 256; Mintz Decl. ¶ 72.  To the contrary, all \ndeclarations make clear that CPB’s sub-awardees know FEMA is responsible for past portal clo-\nsures.  See, e.g., ECF No. 31-4 ¶ 27 (referencing “FEMA’s actions of repeatedly closing the por-\ntal”). \nMoreover, CPB has not shown that is likely that any harm to its reputation will affect it in \na “concrete” way going forward.  CPB vaguely states that “[t]his lack of goodwill impacts” its \n“sub-awardees’ willingness to participate” in the grant program down the road.  Mintz Decl. ¶ 61 \n(emphasis added).  But not one sub-awardee says it will not participate, and probably for good \nreason—after all, they also assert that the federal grants are important to help them upgrade their \ninfrastructure and send emergency alerts.  And CPB is the only organization from whom they can \nobtain these grants.  So any sub-awardee’s loss of faith in CPB’s ability to administer the NGWS \ngrant would not count for much.  Compare Brown v. District of Columbia, 888 F. Supp. 2d 28, 33 \n(D.D.C. 2012) (plaintiff failed to show “that other law schools have refused or would refuse to hire \nher due to defendants’ denial of tenure”), with Atlas Air, Inc. v. Int’l Brotherhood of Teamsters, \n280 F. Supp. 3d 59, 103–04 (D.D.C. 2017) (“If those customers conclude that they cannot rely on \n[plaintiff] for on-time delivery, they are likely to switch contractors or at least reduce the routes \ncovered by [plaintiff].”).  \nFor these reasons, CPB has not identified the kind of “damage” to its reputation that may, \n“under some circumstances,” constitute irreparable injury.  Cardinal Health, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 2d \nat 213 (citation omitted).    \n*      *     * \n  21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 37     Filed 07/15/25     Page 22 of 22\nThe Court recognizes that FEMA’s unpredictable and at times apparently unexplained ac-\ntions earlier this year have caused problems for CPB and its sub-awardees, and nothing in this \nopinion is meant to dismiss or minimize those problems.  But on the record before it, CPB falls far \nshort of satisfying the “high standard for irreparable injury” that warrants the preliminary relief \nthey request.  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor all these reasons, the Court will deny CPB’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  A \nseparate order will issue. \n/s/ Timothy J. Kelly     \nTIMOTHY J. KELLY \nUnited States District Judge \nDate: July 15, 2025 \n  22 ",

As previously \npreviewed  in  Defendants’  opposition  (ECF  No. 33)  to  Plaintiff’s  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction (ECF No. 31), Plaintiff fails to allege any final agency action, and the Agency’s action \nis lawful.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim fails. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Factual Background. \nIn 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (“Department”) awarded Plaintiff a grant \nfor the NGWS.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 23.  The grant is on a cost reimbursement basis.  Id.  Plaintiff \nseeks reimbursement through the Agency’s Payment and Reporting System (“PARS”).  Id. ¶ 25.   \nOn January 28, 2025, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a directive entitled \n“Direction on Grants to Non-governmental Organizations.”  Declaration of Thomas Breslin \n(“Breslin Decl.,” ECF No. 33-1) ¶ 5.  Pursuant to that directive, on February 10, 2025, the Agency \nbegan implementation of a process for the manual review of requests for payment.  Decl. of \nCameron Hamilton (“Hamilton Decl.,” ECF No. 14-1) ¶ 4.  In order to permit a manual review, \nthe Agency placed a “hold toggle” in PARS, effective the following day.  Id. ¶¶ 4, 6; see also \nBreslin Decl. ¶ 6.  The “hold” was not a freeze on the funds.  Cameron Decl. ¶ 6.  Rather, the \n“hold” allowed for the Agency to manually review requests prior to payment.  Id. ¶ 7; see also \nBreslin Decl. ¶ 6 (“FEMA paused funding for all of its grants programs on February 11, 2025 and \nbegan to institute a manual review process under its inherent authority to monitor awards; review \nits grant records and expenditures; and ensure payments to recipients are used only for allowable, \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 6 of 17\n \nallocable, and reasonable costs under the terms and conditions of the grant award before making \npayment to the grant recipient.”).  As such, before releasing funds for reimbursement paid to its \ngrant recipients, the Agency would review grant projects, activities, and source documentation.  \nHamilton Decl. ¶ 9. \nOn March 6, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a \npreliminary injunction enjoining FEMA and other agencies from pausing, freezing, blocking, \ncanceling, suspending, terminating, or otherwise impeding the disbursement of appropriated \nfederal funds to the named plaintiffs in that lawsuit.  See generally New York v. Trump, 769 F. \nSupp. 3d 119 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025), appeal docketed, No. 25-1413 (1st Cir.).  On April 4, 2025, \nthe court ordered FEMA to cease the manual review process implemented per the Secretary’s \nJanuary 28 directive.  See generally New York v. Trump, Civ. A. No. 25-0039, 2025 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 65285 (D.R.I. Apr. 4, 2025), appeal docketed, No. 25-1413 (1st Cir.).  From April 7, 2025, \nto April 14, 2025, the court stayed this order.  See New York v. Trump, Civ. A. No. 25-0039, 2025 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 71893, at *19 (D.R.I. Apr. 14, 2025), appeal docketed, No. 25-1413 (1st Cir.).  \nTo comply with the preliminary injunction, FEMA resumed allowing grant recipients, \nincluding Plaintiff, to draw down grant funds as they had prior to the manual review process.  \nBreslin Decl. ¶ 6.  On May 1, 2025, however, the President issued Executive Order 14290, entitled \nEnding Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media.  Breslin Decl. ¶ 8.  The purpose section of that \nExecutive Order notes that “[u]nlike in 1967, when the CPB was established, today the media \nlandscape is filled with abundant, diverse, and innovative news options.  Government funding of \nnews media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the \nappearance of journalistic independence.”  Exec. Ord. No. 14290, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 19415 (May 1, \n2025).  The Executive Order further notes that “National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 7 of 17\n \nBroadcasting  Service  (PBS)  receive  taxpayer  funds  through  the  Corporation  for  Public \nBroadcasting,” id. § 1, and it directs the heads of all agencies to “identify and terminate, to the \nmaximum extent consistent with applicable law, any direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS,” \nid. § 3(a). \nIn response to that Executive Order, the Agency began a policy review of the NGWS grant \nprogram “because the program is designed for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to receive \nthe grant award and issue subgrants to public broadcasting entities that are National Public Radio \nand Public Broadcasting Service affiliated stations.”  Breslin Decl. ¶ 9.  “On May 8, 2025, as a \nprecaution, while FEMA was conducting the review to ensure compliance with the Biased Media \n[Executive Order], FEMA turned off Plaintiff’s ability to draw down NGWS funds in FEMA GO.”  \nId.  Meanwhile, the Agency “continues to review the NGWS grant program to ensure that the \nprogram’s design effectively serves its statutory purpose, program goals, and agency priorities.”  \nId. ¶ 10.  During the recent preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for Plaintiff represented that \n“if there was some concern that this grant somehow dealt with NPR or PBS, they knew that wasn’t \ntrue” and “[t]hey knew full well this grant has nothing to do with NPR or PBS,” Prelim. Inj. Hrg. \nTr. (ECF No. 35) at 12:2–7; however, even a cursory review of the sub-awardees’ websites \ndemonstrates that there is much more of a connection than Plaintiff represents.  See, e.g., Delta \nCollege Public Media, About Us, https://www.deltabroadcasting.org/about/ (last accessed July 16, \n2025) (“We are your PBS station and your NPR station.”); Blue Ridge Public Television Inc. d/b/a \nBlue Ridge PBS, About US, https://www.blueridgepbs.org/about-us (last accessed July 16, 2025); \nsee also List of Sub-Awardees (ECF No. 4-6) at 2 (identifying sub-awardees). \nThe Agency’s review of the NGWS grant program remains ongoing today.  Breslin Decl. \n¶ 12.  “At this time, FEMA has not made a final determination whether the NGWS grant awards \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 8 of 17\n \nto Plaintiff are effectuating program goals or agency priorities.”  Id.  With the review continuing \nto take time as the Agency ensures faithful compliance with the law, “[o]n June 6, 2025, FEMA \nrestored Plaintiff’s [ ] access and ability to draw down funds under its awards through FEMA GO.”  \nId. ¶ 11.  Thus, “Plaintiff continues to have the ability to draw down funds for their NGWS grant \nprogram awards.”  Id.  A final decision as to what additional action is necessary with respect to \nPlaintiff’s NGWS grants, if any, will be made in the future, but no final decision has been made \nas of today.  Id. ¶ 12. \nII.  Procedural Background. \nOn March 13, 2025, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action.  The Complaint brings one \ncause of action for violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The Complaint does \nnot assert a constitutional claim or any other claim.  The Complaint states that “CPB is challenging \na specific action of withholding NGWS Grant funds.”  Compl. ¶ 59.  Plaintiff then moved for a \ntemporary restraining order (ECF No. 4), which Defendants opposed (ECF No. 14).  The Court \nthereafter denied Plaintiff’s motion.  Min. Order (Mar. 17, 2025); see also TRO Hrg. Tr. (ECF \nNo. 17).  On June 12, 2025, Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 31), which \nDefendants opposed (ECF No. 33).  The Court denied that motion on July 15, 2025 (ECF Nos. 36, \n37). \nPursuant to the Court’s Orders, see, e.g., Min. Order (May 29, 2025); Order (ECF No. 36), \nDefendants now move to dismiss or for summary judgment. \nSTANDARDS OF REVIEW \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may dismiss a complaint where a plaintiff fails to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “a \ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 9 of 17\n \nplausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly,  550  U.S.  544,  570  (2007)).    When  resolving  a  motion  to  dismiss  pursuant  to \nRule 12(b)(6), the pleadings are construed broadly so that all facts pleaded therein are accepted as \ntrue, and all inferences are viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.  See id.  A court is not, \nhowever, required to accept conclusory allegations or unwarranted factual deductions as true.  Id.  \n“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, \ndo not suffice.”  Id.  Likewise, a court need not “accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a \nfactual allegation.”  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).  Ultimately, the focus is on the \nlanguage in the complaint and whether that sets forth sufficient factual allegations to support a \nplaintiff’s claims for relief.   \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may consider additional documents beyond the four corners \nof the Complaint—such as Defendants’ declarations—only if Plaintiff does not object to their \nconsideration at this stage.  See Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1997) \n(allowing consideration of “the pleadings and undisputed documents in the record” on a motion to \ndismiss for failure to exhaust); see also Burnside v. Dep’t of Just., Civ. A. No. 20-2309 (TSC), \n2022 WL 715181, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2022). \nSummary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings and evidence “show[ ] that there is \nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986); Celotex \nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  The burden is on the party moving for summary \njudgment to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. \nat 323.  A genuine issue is one that “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  \nLiberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248.  Once the moving party has met its burden, the nonmoving party \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 10 of 17\n \n“may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but . . . must set forth specific \nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. \nARGUMENT \nThe Complaint should be dismissed, or summary judgment should be entered in favor of \nDefendants, because Plaintiff does not allege any final agency action, and the Agency’s former \ntemporary hold was lawful. \nThe APA permits a reviewing court to set aside a final agency action only if it is “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n“[T]he scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to \nsubstitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).   \nI.  Plaintiff Does Not Challenge Final Agency Action. \nAgency action must be “final” to be reviewable under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Agency \naction is final only if (1) it marks “the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” \nand (2) is “one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal \nconsequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (cleaned up).  Plaintiff’s \nchallenge fails, at minimum, at the first step—Plaintiff has not challenged the consummation of \nthe Agency’s decisionmaking process, as that process remains ongoing to this day.  See Breslin \nDecl. ¶ 12 (“At this time, FEMA has not made a final determination whether the NGWS grant \nawards to Plaintiff are effectuating program goals or agency priorities.”). \nAs the D.C. Circuit has confirmed, “Bennett directs courts to look at finality from the \nagency’s  perspective  (whether  the  action  represents  the  culmination  of  the  agency’s \ndecisionmaking) and from the regulated parties’ perspective (whether rights or obligations have \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 11 of 17\n \nbeen determined, and legal consequences flow).”   Soundboard Ass’n v. FTC, 888 F.3d 1261, 1271 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  “Deficiency from either perspective is sufficient to dismiss a claim.”  Id.  “Thus, \nthere is no need to reach the second Bennett prong if the action does not mark the consummation \nof agency decisionmaking.”  Id.  \n“Context matters, especially when determining whether an action is the ‘consummation’ \nof a decision-making process.”  Or. Health & Sci. Univ. v. Engels, Civ. A. No. 24-2184 (RC), \n2025 WL 1707630, at *7 (D.D.C. June 17, 2025).  To mark the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking, the decision “must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.”  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 177–78.  The Agency’s decision must instead “represent[ ] the culmination of the \nagency’s decisionmaking.”  Soundboard, 888 F.3d at 1271.  Subsequent actions by an agency may \nprove  that  an  interim  event  in  question  was precisely  that—i.e.,  interim—and  was  not  the \nculmination of the agency’s decisionmaking process.  See, e.g., Sw. Airlines Co. v. Dep’t of \nTransp., 832 F.3d 270, 275 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“In assessing whether a particular agency action \nqualifies as final for purposes of judicial review, this court and the Supreme Court have looked to \nthe way in which the agency subsequently treats the challenged action.”); BenefitAlign, LLC v. \nCtrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Civ. A. No. 24-2494 (JEB), 2024 WL 6080275, at *1 \n(D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024) (“Here, given that CMS is currently conducting an audit that will \ndetermine Plaintiffs’ final status, it is unclear why the interim suspension could stand as the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process.”). \nPlaintiff fails to identify any final agency action and has now admitted that the actions it \ninitially challenged were not the culmination of the Agency’s decisionmaking process.  See Pl.’s \nPrelim. Inj. Br. (ECF No. 31-1) at 9–10.  By the time Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 13, \n2025, the Agency had initiated a manual review process for grants.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 33.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 12 of 17\n \nPlaintiff has stated that “on April 21, 2025, close to two weeks after committing to maintain the \nmanual review process regardless of the Court orders, FEMA reversed itself.”  Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. \nBr. at 9.  “Thereafter, FEMA returned functionality to the PARS portal such that CPB was able to \nsubmit expense reimbursement requests, which were then processed consistent with the Uniform \nGuidance and FEMA’s pre-February protocols.”  Id.  Then, “on May 13, 2025, FEMA . . . reversed \nitself again by blocking CPB’s access to submit NGWS expenses through PARS.”  Id. (emphasis \nin original).  Later, “[r]oughly 24 hours before CPB’s motion for preliminary injunction was due \nto be filed, FEMA once again reversed its position, and stated, through its counsel, that the PARS \nportal—first closed . . . , then opened, then once again closed . . .—would now be re-opened.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff now complains of “FEMA’s ever-changing actions,” id. at 9–10, but ever-changing \nactions are the paragon example of actions that do not “represent[ ] the culmination of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking,” Soundboard, 888 F.3d at 1271, and are instead actions of “a merely tentative or \ninterlocutory nature.”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78. \nBecause Plaintiff has not identified a final agency action, Defendants are not presently able \nto compile an administrative record, and Local Civil Rule 7(n) does not apply.  See, e.g., Brzezinksi \nv. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Civ. A. No. 21-0376 (RC), 2021 WL 4191958, at *3 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, \n2021).  The production of an administrative record at this stage is unnecessary—Defendants seek \ndismissal not based on an administrative record, but instead based on the facts alleged in the \nComplaint and the arguments described herein.  See Diakanua v. Rubio, Civ. A. No. 24-1027 \n(TJK), 2025 WL 958271, at *11 n.10 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2025) (“[T]he Court will ‘follow the \ngeneral practice’ and deny that motion because ‘the administrative record is not necessary for the \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 13 of 17\n \nCourt’s decision.’” (citation modified; quoting Arab v. Blinken, 600 F. Supp. 3d 59, 65 n.2 (D.D.C. \n2022))).1 \nBut moreover, consider what the administrative record would look like if the Court were \nto deem Plaintiff to have challenged a final agency action.  Certainly, the administrative record \ncould not include documents that postdate the Complaint because actions that postdate the \nComplaint are not part of the Complaint.  See, e.g., Kendrick v. FBI, No. 22-5271, 2023 WL \n8101123, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 21, 2023) (summarily affirming; “[t]o the extent appellant argues \nthat appellee’s search was inadequate because it failed to produce documents related to a separate \nFOIA request he submitted, appellant’s other FOIA request was not at issue in this litigation \nbecause he had not yet submitted that request when he filed his complaint in this case, and he never \namended his complaint to add claims about it”); West v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 1228, 1235 n.8 (D.C. Cir. \n2017)  (explaining  that  any  “assertions  of  injury”  that  “postdate[ ]  West’s  complaint”  “are \nchronologically problematic”).  But then Plaintiff must be challenging the state of affairs as it \nexisted on March 13, 2025, which Plaintiff has acknowledged has shifted multiple times in the \ninterim, Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Br. (ECF No. 31-1) at 9–10, including with Plaintiff now having received \nthe payments it formerly alleged were being temporarily withheld, compare Compl. ¶ 59, with \nMem. Op. (ECF No. 32) at 8–9.  The “ever-changing” history of this action cries out for a finding \nthat Plaintiff has not challenged the culmination of the Agency’s decisionmaking progress because \nPlaintiff has acknowledged that the Agency’s prior interim decisions have been superseded by \n \n1   In all events, Defendants respectfully request that the Court relieve them of any purported \nobligation to comply with Local Civil Rule 7(n).  See, e.g., Diakanua, 2025 WL 958271, at *11 \nn.10; Sharifymoghaddam v. Blinken, Civ. A. No. 23-1472 (RCL), 2023 WL 8047007, at *3 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 17, 2023) (“In any case, courts in this District routinely allow agencies to waive \ncompliance  with Rule  7(n)(1) if  ‘the  administrative  record  is  not  necessary  for  the  court’s \ndecision.’” (quoting Eljalabi v. Blinken, Civ. A. No. 21-1730 (RC), 2022 WL 2752613, at *3 n.3 \n(D.D.C. July 14, 2022))). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 14 of 17\n \nsubsequent events.  Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Br. (ECF No. 31-1) at 9–10.  Again, “[i]n assessing whether \na particular agency action qualifies as final for purposes of judicial review, [the D.C. Circuit] and \nthe Supreme Court have looked to the way in which the agency subsequently treats the challenged \naction.”  Sw. Airlines, 832 F.3d at 275.  A review of that record here, as confirmed by Plaintiff’s \nown admissions, demonstrates that the Agency had not consummated its decisionmaking process \nwhen Plaintiff filed the Complaint.  Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Br. (ECF No. 31-1) at 9–10. \nEventually, if a decision is made to terminate Plaintiff’s grant once the Agency concludes \nits review, then Plaintiff will be presented with a final agency decision.  See Breslin Decl. ¶ 12.  \nBut that situation has not occurred, and Plaintiff continues to be able to draw down funds.  Id. ¶ 11.  \nAs such, Plaintiff fails to allege a challenge to a final agency action. \nII.  The Agency’s Action as Alleged in the Complaint Is Permissible. \nThe Agency’s former implementation of a manual review process was consistent with the \napplicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms for grants.  Pursuant to its affirmative duty \nunder 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a) to properly manage and administer its federal grants, the Agency has \ninherent authority to manually review source documentation from a grant recipient and other \ninformation relevant to confirming the requested funding.  Hamilton Decl. ¶ 5.  The Agency also \nhas inherent authority to monitor awards, review its grant records and expenditures, and ensure \npayments to recipients are used only for allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs under the terms \nand conditions of the grant award prior to making payment to the grant recipient.  Id.  Thus, the \nAgency has authority to implement the manual review process, as long as the process is consistent \nwith applicable regulations and requirements.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 13.  Notably, the Agency’s former use of \na manual review process was not new.  The Agency had, for years now, already employed a manual \nreview process for six of its grant programs.  Id. ¶ 10 (listing programs). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 15 of 17\n \nMoreover,  the  Agency’s  former  manual  review  process  was  consistent  with  and  in \nfurtherance of the regulatory directives set forth in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 and 31 C.F.R. Part 205.  Id. \n¶¶ 13–19.  The Agency was complying with its affirmative duty “to manage and administer [its] \nFederal award[s] in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated \nprograms are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal \nstatutes and regulations.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a).  This former manual review process was not a \nwithholding, pause, or freeze on funding, nor did it mean that the grant payments were being \nfrozen, held, or not being distributed.  Cameron Decl. ¶ 9.  The Agency was processing payment \nrequests and approving them for payment as appropriate, simply with an added level of internal \ncontrols to ensure that payment requests are reviewed prior to payment being released.  See id. \n¶¶ 8–9.  The “hold” formerly instituted on payments in PARS was simply a system term, which \nwas part of a process to allow the Agency’s staff to manually review grant projects, activities, and \nsource documentation before releasing funds for reimbursement paid to its grant recipients.  See \nid. ¶¶ 9, 21.  Once manual review would be completed, the grants would be made available for \ndraw down.  Id. ¶ 21. \nAs such, the Agency’s former implementation of a manual review process was not arbitrary \nand capricious, contrary to law, in excess of statutory authority, or ultra vires. \nIII.  The Court Should Not Consider Plaintiff’s Shifting Views, but If It Does, Plaintiff’s \nArgument Fails. \nPlaintiff brought a one-count complaint that asserts that its former temporary inability to \ndraw down on a grant violated the APA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 63– 75.  As stated in the Complaint, “CPB \nis challenging a specific action of withholding NGWS Grant funds.”  Id. ¶ 59.  Plaintiff appears to \nhave shifted its theory because indisputably the submission portal has been reopened.  Pl.’s Prelim. \nInj. Mot. at 3; Breslin Decl. ¶ 11.  The “specific action of withholding NGWS Grant funds” that \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 16 of 17\n \nPlaintiff stated it was challenging, Compl. ¶ 59, has been set aside by the Agency already \n(although, again, the Agency notes that the Complaint had mischaracterized the Agency’s former \nactions).  Breslin Decl. ¶ 11. \nIn any event, if the Court were to consider the “agency actions” that Plaintiff’s preliminary \ninjunction motion complained of—namely, the “refus[al] to agree to either keep the [already open] \nportal open or to provide any advance notice and explanation if it seeks to close it in the future,” \nPl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mot. at 3—Plaintiff’s APA claim would likewise fail.  The Complaint offers no \nargument whatsoever that the APA would require the Agency to keep the portal open in perpetuity.   \nOn the merits, the Agency is permitted to close the portal when circumstances warrant.  \nSee, e.g., 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a) (“The Federal agency or pass-through entity must manage and \nadminister the Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and \nassociated programs are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable \nFederal statutes and regulations—including provisions protecting free speech, religious liberty, \npublic welfare, and the environment, and those prohibiting discrimination—and the requirements \nof this part.”).  The Agency is also permitted to “[t]emporarily withhold payments until the \nrecipient or subrecipient takes corrective action,” id. § 200.339(a), or “[s]uspend or terminate the \nFederal award in part or in its entirety,” id. § 200.339(c), if, for instance, “the recipient or \nsubrecipient fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and \nconditions of the Federal award,” id. § 200.339.  The Agency may also terminate a grant “if an \naward no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  Id. § 200.340(a)(2) (2021).2 \n \n2   2 C.F.R. § 200.340 was amended in 2024.  Guidance for Federal Financial Assistance, \n89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30168–69 (Apr. 22, 2024).  The language in the cited subsection was amended \nand moved to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 38-1     Filed 07/22/25     Page 17 of 17\n \nFederal regulations do not require “advance notice” if a decision is made to terminate.  See, \ne.g., id. § 200.341(a); id. § 200.342.  Rather, the Agency must only provide written notice to the \nrecipient, id. § 200.341(a), and allow the recipient thereafter to have “an opportunity to object and \nprovide information challenging the action,” id. § 200.342.  Again, no decision has been made at \nthis time to terminate Plaintiff’s grant.  See Breslin Decl. ¶ 12.  If such a decision is made, then \nPlaintiff will have its opportunity to object.  But federal regulations do not include any requirement \nthat the Agency afford Plaintiff “30-days advance notice,” as Plaintiff demanded when moving for \na preliminary injunction.  Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Br. at 42.  The Complaint points to no requirement in \nlaw or contract that would compel the Agency to provide thirty-days advance notice.   \nAs such, even if the Court were to allow Plaintiff to amend its Complaint through its denied \npreliminary injunction motion, which it should not, the Agency’s actions were not arbitrary and \ncapricious, contrary to law, in excess of statutory authority, or ultra vires. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss the \nComplaint or enter summary judgment in Defendants’ favor. \nDated: July 22, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \nJEANINE FERRIS PIRRO \nUnited States Attorney \n   \n \nBy:  /s/ Douglas C.

FEMA has not identified any reason for this “hold”, and the \nPage 1 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 2 of 25\nadverse effects of FEMA’s failure to process submissions under the NGWS Grant severely and \nnegatively impacts the ability of federal, state, and local authorities to issue real-time emergency \nalerts.  The implementation of the NGWS Grant is necessary to “[c]reate and maintain a resilient \npublic alert and warning system that provides timely and effective warnings, especially including \nareas that are traditionally underserved by broadcast providers.”1  The NGWS Grant was issued in \n2022 as part of the government’s efforts to modernize the national emergency alert system that \nprovides critical emergency and life-saving information to the public  In awarding the NGWS \nGrant, the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA recognized that modernizing the national \nemergency  alert  system  is  “imperative”  and  an  “essential  part  of  America’s  emergency \npreparedness.” \n  FEMA’s hold on these funds is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, in violation of \nlaw, and undermines the emergency alert system relied upon throughout the nation by millions of \npeople whose only access to emergency information is through publicly-issued alerts by public \nbroadcasting stations.  The arbitrary and unlawful nature of FEMA’s failure to allow CPB to submit \nreimbursements and receive payments owing to forty-two (42) sub-awardee public media stations, \nwhich have, in turn, committed funds to purchase critical equipment for NGWS program upgrades \nand enhancements in furtherance of the public interest, is clear cut.  Indeed, FEMA did not even \nattempt to explain its unilateral conduct before the imposition of the “hold,” which violates the \nNGWS Grant and the Uniform Guidance, 2 C.F.R. § 200, nor has it attempted to date to explain \nthe basis for its action. \n \n1 https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ncp-fy24-ngwsgp-nofo.pdf \nPage 2 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 3 of 25\nParties \n1.  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation \ncreated pursuant to the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, 47 U.S.C. § 396. CPB is the \nsteward of the federal government’s investment in public broadcasting and the largest \nsingle source of funding for public radio, television, and related online and mobile services. \nIn addition, CPB administers several grant programs including NGWS. \n2.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency is a federal agency charged with addressing \ndisasters and emergencies. FEMA is a component of the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”). FEMA is headquartered in Washington D.C. \n3.  Cameron Hamilton is currently the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the FEMA \nAdministrator. Mr. Hamilton’s office is located in Washington, D.C. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \nbecause this action arises under federal law, specifically the APA. \n5.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), \nbecause at least one of Defendants is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and a substantial \npart of the events or omissions giving rise to CPB’s claims occurred here. \nFactual Background \n6.  In creating the CPB, Congress made specific findings about national interests in public \nbroadcasting, including: \na.  “it is in the public interest to encourage the growth and development of public radio \nand television broadcasting, including the use of such media for instructional, \neducational, and cultural purposes;” 47 U.S.C. § 396(1); \n \nPage 3 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 4 of 25\nb.  “the encouragement and support of public telecommunications, while matters of \nimportance for private and local development, are also of appropriate and important \nconcern to the Federal Government;” 47 U.S.C. § 396(4); \n \nc.  “it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to complement, assist, \nand  support  a  national  policy  that  will  most  effectively  make  public \ntelecommunications services available to all citizens of the United States;” 47 \nU.S.C. § 396(7); \n \nd.  “public  television  and  radio  stations  and  public  telecommunications  services \nconstitute valuable local community resources for utilizing electronic media to \naddress national concerns and solve local problems through community programs \nand outreach programs;” 47 U.S.C. § 396(8); and \n \ne.  “it is in the public interest for the Federal Government to ensure that all citizens of \nthe United States have access to public telecommunications services through all \nappropriate available telecommunications distribution technologies[.]”  47 U.S.C. \n§ 396(9). \n \nPublic Media's Role In The National Emergency Alert System \n7.  The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national public warning system used by federal, \nstate, local, and tribal authorities to deliver important and timely emergency information, \nsuch as alerts about flash floods, blizzards, tornados, hurricanes, and other national and \nregional emergencies that affect the lives and property of citizens across the country.  As \nthe Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) recognized in its National Emergency \nCommunications  Plan  issued  in  September  2019 \n(www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0924_CISA_ECD-NECP-2019_1.pdf):  \nEmergency communications are critical to the Nation’s ability to respond to \ndevastating natural disasters, terrorist threats, and other emergency events, \nincidents, and routine activities affecting our communities every day. When \nfaced with these situations, the public safety community has a collective \nresponsibility  to  share  information.  Achieving  this  goal  requires \ncommunications capabilities that are resilient and secure today, yet agile \nenough to integrate advanced and emerging technologies tomorrow. \n  \nId. at p.1.  \nPage 4 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 5 of 25\n8.  Public television and radio stations play an integral and essential role in our nation’s \nemergency alert system. Public media’s infrastructure provides the broadest nationwide \ncommunications platform in the country, and its national-local organization allows public \nmedia entities to distribute federal, state, and regional emergency alerts and provide \nencrypted, geo-targeted alerts to local communities in times of public emergencies. \n9.  As discussed below, the U.S. government operates and maintains a national EAS, known \nas the Integrated Public Alert and Warning Systems (“IPAWS”), which serves a gateway \nbetween official entities that need to communicate an emergency alert and the national \ncommunications networks capable of delivering those alters to relevant public audiences.   \nIPAWS SYSTEM AND EMERGENCY ALERTS \n10. IPAWS was created in 2006 pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13407, “Public Alert and \nWarning System.” The President as well as federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal entities \ncan use IPAWS to send emergency alerts. The system, managed by FEMA within DHS, is \ndesigned to receive and authenticate alerting messages from an authorized alert originator \n(e.g., local official) and distribute that single alert across many networks at once (e.g., \nradio, television, cell phone). \n11. FEMA’s website says: “[IPAWS] is FEMA's national system for local alerting that provides \nauthenticated emergency and life-saving information to the public through mobile phones \nusing Wireless Emergency Alerts, to radio and television via the Emergency Alert System, \nand on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Radio.” \n12. Federal, state, and local authorities apply to FEMA to participate in the IPAWS program.  \nOnce authorized, the authorities must utilize specialized software that is designed to work \nproperly within the IPAWS system. \nPage 5 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 6 of 25\n13. When an emergency occurs, the local authorities submit a message to IPAWS.  IPAWS then \nvalidates the message, and broadcasts it to the relevant communities, including by using \npublic broadcasting equipment.  FEMA maintains a visual chart of the process on its \nwebsite:2 \n \n14. FEMA’s website drives home the importance of the IPAWS system and the emergency \nalerts issued through it, detailing the following real world examples of the impact of the \nemergency alert system3: \na.  “MASSACHUSETTS 11-YEAR-OLD ONE OF MANY RECOVERED THANKS \nTO AMBER ALERT After a stranger forced an 11-year-old girl in Springfield, \nMassachusetts into his vehicle, an AMBER Alert was promptly sent out, spurring \nthe community in to action. An outpouring of videos and pictures of the suspected \n \n2 https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system \n3 https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ipaws_101-slicksheet_042024.pdf \nPage 6 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 7 of 25\nkidnapper  and  his  vehicle  flooded  in,  providing  detectives  with  invaluable \ninformation that led to the safe recovery of the girl and the arrest of the kidnapper.”  \nb.  “TORNADO SURVIVORS CREDIT WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT FOR \nSAVING THEIR LIVES  Survivors of a deadly tornado had more than luck to thank \nfor their lives. At roughly 3 a.m., in the black of night, a tornado touched down in \nBollinger County, Missouri, setting out on a path that left five dead and many \ninjured and homeless. It could have been worse. A WEA sent by officials to all in \nthe tornado’s path, allowed many people to seek shelter, potentially saving their \nlives.” \nc.  “POWER BLACKOUTS AVERTED THANKS TO WIRELESS EMERGENCY \nALERT  Power blackouts can disrupt societies like few other disasters. They can \nsever communications, water supplies, and transportation; close gas stations, ATMs \nand grocery stores; prevent the use of medical devices; and cause mass food \nspoilage. A record-breaking California heatwave led to an extraordinarily high level \nof energy consumption. The state’s power grid was strained and power blackouts \nwere imminent. A critical WEA was sent, asking Californians to “conserve energy \nnow”. Within five minutes, energy usage had reduced across the state by nearly 2.4 \npercent, leaving enough power to prevent disaster.” \n15. Public broadcasting stations reach 99% of the American population and are the only local \nmedia in many communities. Some public stations serve as their state’s primary Emergency \nAlert Service hub for inclement weather and Amber alerts. Between January 1, 2023, and \nJanuary 1, 2024, 8,500 Wireless Emergency Alerts were issued by over 1,600 federal, state, \nPage 7 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 8 of 25\nlocal, tribal and territorial authorities and transmitted over public media throughout the \ncountry. \n16. For example, during the January 2025 wildfires, Southern California public media stations \nprovided timely news and information, on air and online, to more than 18 million people. \nFrom January 7-13, 2025, local alerting authorities issued 111 geotargeted alerts, including \nfire weather warnings and fire outbreak alerts, evacuation warnings and orders, and curfew \nnotices. The stations also offered real-time guides and resources for those threatened by the \nfires, partnering to send out daily newsletters with the latest updates from all  their \norganizations. \n17. In November 2024, when it authorized an additional $40 million in grant funding for the \nNGWS system for fiscal year 2025, the Senate Appropriations Committee said:  “These \ncritical investments across the country help to support the efforts of our firefighters, \nemergency  medical  technicians,  and  other  first  responders;  build  resiliency  in  our \ncommunities; increase capacity to provide alerts and warnings; and protect communities \nacross the country.”4  See also H.R. 8752, Title III (June 28, 2024) (appropriating $40 \nmillion for NGWS grant funds).   \n2022 NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY AND GRANT \n18. On September 22, 2022, DHS and FEMA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity in \nconnection with congressionally authorized funding for the Next Generation Warning \nSystem.  According to FEMA’s website:  “The Next Generation Warning System Grant \n \n4 https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/majority/bill-summary-homeland-security-fiscal-year-2025-\nappropriations-bill \nPage 8 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 9 of 25\nProgram (NGWSGP) will support investments that improve the resilience and security of \npublic broadcasting networks and systems.”5 \n19. The grant was designed to: \na.  “Enable public television broadcasters to upgrade to the Advanced Television \nSystems Committee broadcast standard (ATSC 3.0).” \nb.  “Enable public radio stations to upgrade to digital capabilities to enable broadcast \nof IPAWS alerts.” \nc.  “Enable  the  capability  to  alert,  warn  and  provide  equivalent  information  to \nindividuals with disabilities, individuals with access and functional needs, and \nindividuals with limited-English proficiency.”  \nd.  “Enable alerts and warnings on the basis of geographic location as well as those \nprojects  that  improve  the  ability  of  remote  rural  areas  to  receive  alerts  and \nwarnings.”6 \n20. The NOFO sets forth the importance of the grant funding: “Having in place a secure and \neffective system for warning and informing the public of  impending natural and man-made \ndisasters is an essential part of America's emergency preparedness. FEMA’s Integrated \nPublic Alert & Warning System (IPAWS) is the national system for local alerting that \nprovides authenticated emergency and life-saving information to the public. Local radio \nand TV stations, along with cable, direct broadcast satellite, and wireless service providers \ndisseminate the public safety messages they receive from IPAWS. This grant supports \nprojects that aid in creating and maintaining a resilient public alert and warning system that \n \n5 https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-\nsystem/broadcasters-wireless/ngwsp \n6 https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-\nsystem/broadcasters-wireless/ngwsp \nPage 9 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 10 of 25\nprovides timely and effective warnings, especially including areas that are traditionally \nunderserved by broadcast providers. This public alert and warning system is built on the \nCommon Alerting Protocol standard (CAP) that permits a single CAP compatible message \nto  activate  multiple  compliant  warning  systems  and  a  station’s’  ability  to  maintain \ncontinuity  of  operations  during  emergencies.  The  Next  Generation  Warning  System \nincludes all available radio and television technology in the alert and warning ecosystem \nto expand and enhance emergency information dissemination to the public. The grant is \nintended to replace aging infrastructure to enhance alerting capabilities, improve resiliency, \noperational continuity, and security through new technology for qualified rural, tribal, and \nother stations who support underserved public broadcast audiences. Broadcasters may use \nfunding to replace aging equipment and improve cybersecurity hygiene. This program \nsupports investments that improve resiliency, continuity of broadcast operations, and \nsecurity of public broadcasting networks and systems.”7 \n21. As DHS and FEMA acknowledged in the NOFO, “[i]nvestments in technology, training, \nand support equipment creates financial burdens, especially for stations serving rural, \ntribal, territorial, and underserved areas. This grant is intended to alleviate these financial \nburdens for public broadcast stations needing to upgrade their equipment or improve their \nresilience during disasters. In these communities, public broadcast stations often serve as \na primary source of critical emergency information compared to other areas with greater \nconcentrations of private broadcasters.”8 \n \n7 https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ncp-fy24-ngwsgp-nofo.pdf \n8 https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ncp-fy24-ngwsgp-nofo.pdf \nPage 10 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 11 of 25\n22. The NOFO also states that “The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is the only eligible \napplicant.”9  \n23. Congress appropriated $40 million for the 2022 NGWS Grant in Public Law 117-103, at \n136 Stat. 328 (March 15, 2022).  CPB was awarded the NGWS Grant to administer these \nfunds and to make sub-awards to public media stations consistent with the NOFO and \nassociated documentation. The grant was made on a cost reimbursement basis, meaning \nthat the public media stations would incur expenses in purchasing the critical equipment \nand infrastructure and then seek reimbursement from CPB which would, in turn seek \nreimbursement from FEMA. \n24. Since that time, CPB has been diligently working with FEMA and currently has issued over \nforty executed contracts to sub-awardees in reliance on this grant with approximately $18.7 \nmillion fully committed. The total amount that has already been expended is $1.5-$2 \nmillion with respect to grantees, with another $780,000 already incurred with a consultant \nto CPB for a total of $2.25 -$2.5 million. At every stage of this process, CPB has kept \nFEMA fully informed of the status of the sub-awards. At no point has FEMA indicated that \nCPB has done anything that would call this grant into question.  At no point has FEMA \nindicated that it is cancelling the grant or taking any other adverse action with respect to \nthe grant. \n25. As a matter of routine practice, and pursuant to the terms of the grant as well as the Uniform \nGuidance, 2 C.F.R. § 200, CPB expends funds then draws for reimbursement through the \nPayment and Reporting System (“PARS”), which includes the expenses incurred by sub-\nawardees under the NGWS Grant.  \n \n9 https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ncp-fy24-ngwsgp-nofo.pdf \nPage 11 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 12 of 25\n26. On February 19, 2025, when CPB accessed PARS, it indicated that funds were “on hold,” \neffectively meaning that there were no funds currently available under the NGWS Grant. \nA true and accurate screenshot of the message on the PARS system is attached as Exhibit \nA. As of the date of this Complaint, CPB has received no notices of FEMA – or indeed any \ncommunications of any kind – indicating that the status of this grant has changed. Below \nis a true and accurate screenshot from February 19, 2025: \n \n \n27. FEMA’s “hold” status in the PARS systems prevents CPB from submitting any further \nreimbursement requests under the NGWS Grant, leaving public media stations across the \ncountry with hundreds of thousands of dollars of unreimbursed expenses.  To date, over \n$1.88 million of incurred expenses need to be reimbursed to the sub-awardees. \n28. In light of FEMA’s failure to allow CPB access to its NWGS Grant funding to reimburse \nthe very sub-awardees that FEMA directed CPB to issue awards, CPB, on February 20, \n2025, issued a letter to FEMA demanding that access to the funding be restored and that in \nthe future it will abide by the terms of the Uniform Guidance.  The letter also copied FEMA \nOffice of the Chief Counsel and the Office of the General Counsel of DHS.  \nPage 12 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 13 of 25\n29. In light of the necessity for prompt action, the letter requested a response by February 24, \n2025, stating: \nWhile CPB is reluctant to impose any deadlines, it is suffering continuing \nand irreparable harm for each day that passes with no clarity to the status of \nthe grant award and no means of seeking redress through FEMA procedures.  \nAccordingly, I must request that FEMA respond no later than the close of \nbusiness on February 24, 2025. \n \n30. As of the date of this Complaint, neither DHS nor FEMA has responded in any way to this \nletter. By way of limited example, FEMA has provided no explanation of what the “hold” \nmeans. It has not provided any explanation for the reason for the “hold.” It has not provided \nany schedule for resolving the hold. \n31. A day after the February 24, 2025 deadline, the U.S. District Court for the District of D.C. \nissued a preliminary injunction in National Council of Nonprofits, et al. v. Office of \nManagement  and  Budget,  et  al.,  Case  No.  1:25-cv-002399-LLA,  ordering  that  the \ngovernment instruct all agencies that they “not take any steps to implement, give effect to, \nor reinstate under a different name the unilateral, non-individualized directives in OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal Funds under all open \nawards. It shall also instruct those agencies to continue releasing any disbursements on \nopen awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”  (ECF Doc. No. 51).  \nAccordingly, this “hold” must be construed as a separate and independent agency action \nthat must itself comply with the APA. \n32. On the afternoon of Friday, February 28, 2025, FEMA sent out a general email purporting \nto go to all recipients of any grant from FEMA.  The email did not respond to CPB’s \ncommunication regarding the NGWS Grant, and  provided no details on the reasons for \nthe hold other than FEMA was seeking “to ensure the alignment of its grant programs \nPage 13 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 14 of 25\nwith Secretary Noem’s direction.”  It provided no details as to what that means or when \nany “alignment” would be complete.  Similarly, it did not address how grantees, such as \nCPB, are to deal with costs already incurred.  \n33. FEMA also sought to impose additional requirements not included in the NGWS Grant or \nthe Uniform Guidance, stating: \na.  As part of the manual review of your payment request, FEMA strongly \nencourages recipients to include the following information when submitting new \npayment requests: \n \ni.  Will this disbursement go to any subrecipients, and if so, which ones? \nii.  What is the total amount of funds going to each subrecipient? \niii.  What activities will be funded by this disbursement? \niv.  What is the time period covered by this payment request? \n… Please note that if FEMA does not receive this information, payment requests \nwill not be processed. \n \n34. Not only was this outside of prior practice and the Uniform Guidance, FEMA has imposed \ndemands that were impossible to comply with.  Specifically, after receiving this email, CPB \nattempted  to  access  the  PARS  portal  to  provide  this  additional  information  for  the \noutstanding reimbursement requests but the PARS portal was inactive, and did not allow \nCPB to submit any information.    Consequently, there is no way for CPB to submit any \ninformation to FEMA due to FEMA’s inactivation of the PARS portal. \n35. The February 28, 2025 email from FEMA concluded with the sentence: “[f]or questions, \nplease reach out to your designated FEMA point of contact for the specific grant award.” \nYet, when CPB contacted its FEMA representatives for the NGWS Grant, the \nrepresentative could not provide any information as to why the “hold” was in place, why \nPage 14 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 15 of 25\nreimbursement requests could no longer be made, or how the situation could be resolved.  \nAs noted above, legal counsel to FEMA and DHS have remained similarly unresponsive. \n36. On March 6, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in New York, \net al v. Trump, et al, Case No. 25-cv-39-JJM-PAS issued a preliminary injunction \ndirecting numerous federal agencies that were defendants in that case, including DHS, \nthat: \nThe Agency Defendants are enjoined from reissuing, adopting, \nimplementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the \ndirectives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 (the “OMB Directive”) with \nrespect to the disbursement and transmission of appropriated federal funds \nto the States under awarded grants, executed contracts, or other executed \nfinancial obligations. \n \nThe Agency Defendants are enjoined from pausing, freezing, blocking, \ncanceling, suspending, terminating, or otherwise impeding the \ndisbursement of appropriated federal funds to the States under awarded \ngrants, executed contracts, or other executed financial obligations based \non the OMB Directive, including funding freezes dictated, described, or \nimplied by Executive Orders issued by the President before rescission of \nthe OMB Directive or any other materially similar order, memorandum, \ndirective, policy, or practice under which the federal government imposes \nor applies a categorical pause or freeze of funding appropriated by \nCongress. \n \n37. The Court further directed that the “Agency Defendants shall also instruct those agencies \nto release and transmit any disbursements to the States on awarded grants, executed \ncontracts, or other executed financial obligations that were paused on the grounds of the \nOMB Directive and Executive Orders included by reference therein or issued before the \nrescission of the OMB Directive.” \n38. In its decision, the U.S. Court for the District of Rhode Island also noted FEMA’s \napparent disregard of the preliminary injunction issued by the D.C. District Court, noting \nthat the “States filed another motion to enforce the TRO on February 28, 2025 relating to \nPage 15 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 16 of 25\nFEMA funds that continue to be frozen despite the Court's TRO and subsequent \nclarifying orders. ECF No. 160. The Court will address that motion later in this Order.”  \nIn so doing, the Court then ordered that.:  “In light of the States’ second motion to \nenforce the TRO, ECF No. 160, Defendant Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(“FEMA”) shall file a status report on or before March 14, 2025, informing the Court of \nthe status of their compliance with this order.” \n39. The injunction further directed that: \nThe Defendants must provide written notice of this Order to all federal \ndepartments and agencies to which the OMB Directive was addressed. The \nwritten notice shall instruct those departments and agencies that they may \nnot take any steps to implement, give effect to, or reinstate under a \ndifferent name or through other means the directives in the OMB Directive \nwith respect to the disbursement or transmission of appropriated federal \nfunds to the States under awarded grants, executed contracts, or other \nexecuted financial obligations. \n \n40. Accordingly, FEMA must justify its action based solely on the explanations provided \nbefore the “hold” – that is, it must explain why its total silence passes APA muster.   \nLegal Framework for Grant Payments \n41. Termination of the grant is governed by the Uniform Guidance and the terms of the NOFO. \nThe NOFO provides: \nIf a recipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a federal \naward,  FEMA  may  terminate  the  award  in  whole  or  in  part.  If  the \nnoncompliance can be corrected, FEMA may first attempt to direct the \nrecipient  to  correct  the  noncompliance.  This  may  take  the  form  of  a \nCompliance Notification. If the noncompliance cannot be corrected or the \nrecipient  is  non-responsive,  FEMA  may  proceed  with  a  Remedy \nNotification, which could impose a remedy for noncompliance per 2 C.F.R. \n§  200.339,  including  termination.  Any  action  to  terminate  based  on \nnoncompliance  will  follow  the  requirements  of  2  C.F.R.  §§  200.341-\n200.342 as well as the requirement of 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(c) to report in \nFAPIIS the recipient’s material failure to comply with the award terms and \nconditions. See also the section on Actions to Address Noncompliance in \nthis notice. \nPage 16 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 17 of 25\n42. CPB has not received either a Compliance Notification or a Remedy Notification. Indeed, \nsuch notifications would not have been justified in fact or in law since CPB is in full \ncompliance with the terms of the award. \n43. Turning to the Uniform Guidance, with respect to termination of a grant, it provides: \nThe Federal agency or pass-through entity must provide written notice of \ntermination  to  the  recipient  or  subrecipient.  The  written  notice  of \ntermination should include the reasons for termination, the effective date, \nand the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable.  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.341 (emphasis added). \n44. Put simply, the Uniform Guidance provides one and only one way to properly terminate a \ngrant: there must be a written notice of termination. A grant may not be terminated sub \nsilentio by withholding reimbursement funds through PARS. \n45. The Uniform Guidance contains additional requirements. \nThe  Federal  agency  must  maintain  written  procedures  for  processing \nobjections,  hearings,  and  appeals.  Upon  initiating  a  remedy  for \nnoncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective action plan, or \ntermination),  the  Federal  agency  must  provide  the  recipient  with  an \nopportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. The \nFederal agency or pass-through entity must comply with any requirements \nfor hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the \nrecipient  or  subrecipient  is  entitled  under  any  statute  or  regulation \napplicable to the action involved. \n2 C.F.R. § 200.342 (emphasis added). \n46. These requirements are not optional. To date, FEMA has not conformed its conduct to these \nrequirements. \n47. In the absence of proper termination, The Uniform Guidance mandates prompt payment. \nPayments for allowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the \nperiod of performance unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or in \none of the following instances: \n(i) The recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with \nthe terms and conditions of the Federal award; or \nPage 17 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 18 of 25\n(ii) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to \nthe  United  States  as  defined  in  OMB  Circular  A-129, \n“Policies  for  Federal  Credit  Programs  and  Non-Tax \nReceivables.” Under such conditions, the Federal agency or \npass-through entity may, after providing reasonable notice, \nwithhold  payments  to  the  recipient  or  subrecipient  for \nfinancial obligations incurred after a specified date until the \nconditions are corrected or the debt is repaid to the Federal \nGovernment. \n2 C.F.R. § 200.305 (emphasis added). \n48. Prior to February 19, 2025, FEMA would typically issue payment to CPB through PARS \nwithin two business days of a submitted request. \nIrreparable Injuries \n49. CPB is statutorily prohibited from using its general operating funds to pay for NGWS Grant \nexpenses or to reimburse sub-awardees for their NGWS Grant expenses.  See, generally, \n47  U.S.C.  §  396(k).    CPB  is  contractually  required  to  reimburse  sub-awardees  for \nexpenditures made pursuant to the grant sub-awards. Although CPB has other funding, \nsuch funding is statutorily required to be used for other purposes. It would violate such \nstatutory mandates to repurpose such funding, even on an interim basis, to the NGWS \nprogram. \n50. There are many stations who have expended money in reliance on the reimbursement under \nthe grant. For example, KBRW in Utqiagvik, Alaska,10 has spent about $98,000 of its sub-\naward  of  up  to  $98,853,  none  of  which  has  been  reimbursed.    See \nhttps://www.webcenterfairbanks.com/2025/02/26/alaska-emergency-warning-system-\nupgrades-paused-amid-fema-funding-questions/. \n \n10 Utqiagvik is also known as Barrow. \nPage 18 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 19 of 25\n51. KBRW is the only broadcast entity serving the nearly 95,000 square mile North Slope \nBorough of Alaska.  The North Slope is located predominantly above the Arctic Circle, and \nthe majority of communities there have limited or no internet access.  KBRW is the only \nsource of information for most of the approximately 12,000 people who live there. \n52. Similarly, news articles in northern New York report that “The North Country's ability to \nreceive timely and reliable alerts  about  flash floods, blizzards, tornadoes, and other \nemergencies is in jeopardy” due to “hold” imposed by FEMA.  The article further notes \nthat the radio station “was directed by the granting organization to purchase the equipment \nand perform the work required and approved to complete the project, but reimbursed is \nnow in doubt.”  According to the news article, this station has “34 transmitters” that “can \nreach  more  than  a  half-million  people  across  an  area  the  size  of  Switzerland  See \nhttps://suncommunitynews.com/news/116239/stop-work-order-hobbles-ncpr-emergency-\nbroadcasting/.  \n53. If CPB is unable to reimburse KBRW and other sub-awardees, CPB will face imminent \nlitigation and the stations will either have their working capital depleted or too will face \nlitigation. There are a substantial number of station sub-awardees in similar situations. \n54. Further delays in accessing funds to the NGWS Grant will also delay the implementation \nof the equipment needed to meet the demands of the national emergency warning system. \nAs FEMA itself has explained: \nHaving in place an effective system for warning and informing the American public \nof impending natural and man-made disasters is an essential part of America's \nemergency  preparedness.  FEMA’s  Integrated  Public Alert  & Warning  System \n(IPAWS)  is  the national  system  for  local  alerting  that  provides  authenticated \nemergency  and  life-saving  information  to  the  public.  Local  radio  and TV \nstations, along with cable, direct broadcast satellite and wireless service providers, \ndisseminate the public safety messages they receive from IPAWS’ \nNOFO at 3. \nPage 19 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 20 of 25\n55. FEMA further states: \nUpgrading  to  this  advanced  technology  requires  investments  in  technology, \ntraining,  and  support  equipment  that  may  create  burdens  for  broadcasters, \nespecially small stations in rural and underdeveloped areas. In these areas, public \nbroadcast stations often serve a much larger role in providing critical emergency \ninformation than in other areas with greater concentrations of private broadcasters. \nThe NGWSGP is intended to ease this burden for qualified public broadcast \nrecipients of grant funding. \n \nNOFO at 4. \n56. CPB is also being placed in an impossible situation. Under the NGWS Grant, there is no \nright to terminate for convenience.  Therefore, failure to pay the sub-awardees creates the \nrisk of liability.  If it does not terminate the sub-award, it risks increasing financial exposure \nwith  no  assurance  of  reimbursement.  Further,  this  untoward  action  has  put  CPB’s \nreputation as a responsible steward of federal funds at risk. \n57. Even if FEMA were to direct CPB to cancel existing contracts – which it is unclear that it \nhas the legal authority to do – CPB could still be contractually required to pay stations for \nequipment already purchased, but yet could not legally make those payments.  This is \nbecause  CPB  receives  appropriated  funds,  and  it  cannot  use  funds  appropriated  by \nCongress for one purpose to pay obligations for a different purpose.  Put simply, only \nNGWS Grant funds can be used to pay NGWS Grant obligations. \n58. In addition to the sub-awards, CPB has at least five employees who are wholly or partly \nfunded through the FEMA grant. Normally, CPB pays their salaries and benefits and then \nseeks reimbursement through PARS. The “hold” has prevented CPB from obtaining such \nreimbursement forcing it into the position of using other funds or either furloughing or \nterminating such employees with no assurance that they will be available when and if \naccess to the FEMA grant is restored, potentially delaying implementation of equipment \nPage 20 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 21 of 25\nnecessary to update the national emergency alerting system. If CPB is unable to meet \npayroll for its NGWS-funded employees, that could immediately result in the furloughing \nof those employees. \n59. CPB is challenging a specific action of withholding NGWS Grant funds. The United States \nhas admitted in other litigation that such specific action may be subject to challenge under \nthe APA. “[T]he APA might allow Plaintiffs to challenge specific withholdings of funds \nunder a particular grant.” Defendants’ Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction at 29 (filed in New York v. Trump, CA No. 1:25-cv-39-JJM (Feb. \n12, 2025)). \n60. The FEMA “hold” action has led to legal consequences and constitutes final agency action. \n61. In taking such action, FEMA has ignored the significant reliance interests of CPB and the \nsub-awardees. \nClaims for Relief \n \nCount I \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – 706(2)(A) \n62. CPB restates and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here. \n63. FEMA is an agency under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n64. Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action … found to be \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n65. The FEMA action is arbitrary and capricious in multiple respects. \n66. If FEMA’s “hold” is not a unilateral and unexplained action, then it appears to be in direct \nviolation of numerous injunctions issued by the federal courts relating to the attempt to \nfreeze agencies from spending or disbursing funds appropriated by Congress. If it is such \nPage 21 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 22 of 25\na unilateral action, then it cannot rely on any post-hoc justification, and certainly not one \nthat contains no meaningful grant-specific information or timeline. \n67. The “hold” is not an action recognized either by the NOFO or the Uniform Guidance. Put \nsimply, there is no such action that is legally cognizable. \n68. To the extent the “hold” does not terminate the NGWS Grant, then it is inconsistent with \nthe terms of the grant and inconsistent with the Uniform Guidance which requires prompt \npayment of monies due to a grantee. \n69. To the extent the “hold” is intended to terminate the NGWS Grant, it fails to comply with \nthe explicit procedures set forth in the Uniform Guidance, (i) because there is no basis to \nterminate the grant, and (ii) it abrogates the obligation to allow CPB to appeal from any \ntermination. \n70. Moreover, the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq., circumscribes \nFEMA’s authority to immediately, categorically, and indefinitely pause obligated grant \nfunding. The Impoundment Control Act permits FEMA to impound (i.e., decline to spend) \nfederal funds only under a very narrow set of specific circumstances. The Impoundment \nControl Act  does  not  permit  FEMA  to  unilaterally,  categorically,  immediately,  and \nindefinitely freeze disbursement of federal funds. \n71. The “hold” fails to account for the substantial reliance interests in the ordinary processes \nof federal grantmaking. “When an agency changes course … it must be cognizant that \nlongstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken \ninto account,’’ and the failure to do so is arbitrary and capricious. DHS v. Regents of the \nUniv. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nPage 22 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 23 of 25\nIn this particular case, the reliance interests are explicit and intended as part of the grant \naward and the CPB sub-awards. \n72. Third, to the extent that the “hold” is intended to allow for some form of internal review of \ngrants issued by FEMA, it fails to articulate why such review of existing grant programs \nrequires an immediate cessation of this specific grant, notwithstanding the immense \ndisruption that will cause, and why that review could not simply be conducted while \nexisting obligations and disbursements continue as normal. Indeed, the FEMA action \ncontains no explanation whatsoever and no clarification has been issued by FEMA. \n73. An agency action is arbitrary or capricious where it is not “reasonable and reasonably \nexplained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency must \nprovide “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n74. That “reasoned explanation requirement of administrative law . . . is meant to ensure that \nagencies  offer  genuine  justifications  for  important  decisions,  reasons  that  can  be \nscrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 785 (2019). An action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency “failed to consider \n. . . important aspect[s] of the problem” before it. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the \nUniv. of Calif., 591 U.S. 1, 25 (2020) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43). \n75. Because FEMA provided no reasoned basis – indeed no basis at all – for imposing the \n“hold” and failed to consider the consequences of its actions, that action was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  \n \nPage 23 of 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740     Document 1     Filed 03/13/25     Page 24 of 25\nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray that this Court: \na. Declare unlawful and set aside the “hold” as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\nor otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);\nb.

The NGWS Grant was issued \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 4     Filed 03/13/25     Page 2 of 5\nin 2022 as part of the government’s efforts to modernize the national emergency alert system that \nprovides critical emergency and life-saving information to the public.  In awarding the NGWS \nGrant, the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA recognized that modernizing the national \nemergency  alert  system  is  “imperative”  and  an  “essential  part  of  America’s  emergency \npreparedness.”   \nFEMA’s “hold” prevents CPB from submitting any reimbursement requests under the \nNGWS Grant, leaving public broadcasting stations across the country with hundreds of thousands \nof dollars of unreimbursed expenses.  To date, there is over $1.95 million of incurred expenses that \nneed to be reimbursed to these NGWS Grant sub-awardees.  Not only has FEMA failed to identify \nany reason for this “hold,” which is irreparably harming CPB, forty-two sub-awardees who have \nincurred expenses to purchase the critical equipment for the NGWS program, and the public at \nlarge, its conduct also violates the NGWS Grant and the Uniform Guidance, 2 C.F.R. Part 200.  \nGiven  that  numerous  federal  courts,  including  this  Court,  have  already  issued  preliminary \ninjunctions directing the government to inform its agencies to transmit any disbursements on \nawarded grants, executed contracts, or other executed financial obligations, it appears that FEMA \nis  now  independently  acting  to  frustrate  the  submission  of  incurred  grant  expenses  for \nreimbursement and the payment of those expenses using appropriated funds.  \n  FEMA’s conduct frustrates the purpose of a grant that both DHS and FEMA recognized \nwas “imperative” and “essential” to America’s preparedness to issue timely and effective life-\nsaving federal, state, local, and tribal emergency alerts.  CPB seeks a temporary restraining order \nto remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, \nas follows: \n  directing FEMA to remove the “hold” from its Payment and Reporting System (“PARS”) \nso that reimbursement requests can be submitted by CPB;   \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 4     Filed 03/13/25     Page 3 of 5\n  directing  FEMA  to  process  those  submitting  reimbursement  requests  according  to \napplicable law, regulation, and the terms of the NGWS Grant. \n \n  enjoining  FEMA  and  its  officers,  employees,  and  agents  from  taking  any  steps  to \nimplement, apply, or enforce the “hold” on the disbursement of appropriated funds for the \nNGWS Grant. \n \nCPB further request that the Court order Defendants to file a status report within twenty-\nfour hours of the issuance of any temporary restraining order, and every two weeks thereafter for \ntwelve weeks, confirming the regular processing and disbursement of federal funds to pay incurred \nexpenses under the NGSW Grant.  \nAs set forth in more detail in the accompanying brief, FEMA’s conduct violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act because it is arbitrary and capricious, and violates the law, including \ninjunctions already issued by various federal courts.  Plaintiff and its forty-two sub-awardees, \nwhich are public radio and television stations, are suffering and  will continue to suffer imminent \nand irreparable harm unless FEMA’s purported “hold” is enjoined. \nPursuant to Local Civil Rule 65.1(a), at 3:23 p.m. on March 13, 2025, counsel for Plaintiffs \nemailed the three Assistant Directors for the Federal Programs Branch of the Department of Justice \nto provide them with electronic copies of the complaint, this motion for a temporary restraining \norder, the accompanying memorandum, the Declarations of Daryl Mintz, Jeff Seifert, Mollie \nKabler, Mitch Teich, Cindy Spizarny, Michael Gavin, and associated exhibits, and a proposed \norder. \n   \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 4     Filed 03/13/25     Page 4 of 5\n \nBy:  /s/ Jason W.

For \nthe reasons discussed below , the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion.   \nINTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Corporation for Public Broadcasting (“CPB”) seeks emergency relief to enjoin \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA” or “Agency”) from taking an action that \nit is not taking.  Plaintiff alleges that the Agency is withholding funding for the grant related to \nthe Next Generation Warning System (“NGWS”).  However, the Agency is taking no such \naction—there has been no withholding of funding.  Rather, the Agency has modified its process \nfor the review of payment requests—a process that is consistent with its authority to protect the \npublic fisc and ensure grant programs are free from waste, fraud, and abuse.  As such, Plaintiff’s \nmotion should be rejected wholesale. \nFirst, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits because: (1) \nPlaintiff does not identify a final agency action; and (2) the Agency has not acted contrary to law.  \nSecond, Plaintiff fails to establish irreparable harm because: (1) its alleged harms are monetary \nand therefore are by definition reparable at law and (2) Plaintiff waited to bring its demand for \nextraordinary relief.  And, third, the balance of harms and the public interest weigh in favor of \nthe Agency’s ability to protect the integrity of government funding programs consistent with its \nconstitutional and statutory authorities.  \nAccordingly, for the reasons discussed below, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s demand \nfor extraordinary relief, especially because Plaintiff’s demand is that it be granted the requested \nultimate relief.  See Aminjavaheri v. Biden, Civ. A. No. 21-2246 (RCL), 2021 WL 4399690, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Sept. 27, 2021) (“Moreover, the D.C. Circuit has cautioned that a preliminary injunction \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 6 of 16\n‘should not work to give a party essentially the full relief he seeks on the merits.’” (quoting \nDorfmann v. Boozer, 414 F.2d 1168, 1173 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (citations omitted)). \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (“Department”) awarded Plaintiff a grant \nfor the NGWS.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 23.  The grant is on a cost reimbursement basis.  Id. \nPlaintiff seeks reimbursement through the Agency’s Payment and Reporting System (“PARS”).  \nId. ¶ 25.   \nOn February 10, 2025, the Agency began implementation of a process for the manual \nreview of requests for payment.  Decl. of Cameron Hamilton (attached hereto as Ex. A) ¶ 4.  In \norder to permit a manual review, the Agency placed a “hold toggle” on individual hold in PARS.  \nId. ¶¶ 4, 6.  The “hold” is not a freeze on the funds.  Id. ¶ 6.  Rather, the “hold” allows for the \nAgency to manually review requests prior to payment.  Id. ¶ 7.  As such, before releasing funds \nfor reimbursement paid to its grant recipients, the Agency reviews grant projects, activities, and \nsource documentation.  Id. ¶ 9. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n“A [temporary restraining order] is an extraordinary remedy and should be granted \nsparingly.”  Basel Action Network v. Mar. Admin., 285 F. Supp. 2d 58, 60 (D.D.C. 2003).  A party \nseeking a temporary restraining order must make a “clear showing that four factors, taken \ntogether, warrant relief: likely success on the merits, likely irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and accord with the public interest.”  \nLeague of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Pursuing \nAm.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016)); Hall v. Johnson, 599 F. Supp. 2d \n1, 3 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009) (“The same standard applies to both temporary restraining orders and to \npreliminary  injunctions”).    The  moving  party  bears  the  burden  of  persuasion  and  must \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 7 of 16\ndemonstrate, “by a clear showing,” that the requested relief is warranted.  Hospitality Staffing \nSols., LLC v. Reyes, 736 F. Supp. 2d 192, 197 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiff Fails to Demonstrate A Likelihood of Success on the Merits. \nThe APA permits a reviewing court to set aside a final agency action only if it is “arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  “[T]he scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a \ncourt is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  Under the APA standard of review, an agency’s \ndecision need not be “a model of analytical precision to survive a challenge.”  Dickson v. Sec’y \nof Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1404 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  It is sufficient if an agency’s explanation of its \ndecision contains “a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 43.  In addition, “if the necessary articulation of basis for \nadministrative action can be discerned by reference to clearly relevant sources other than a formal \nstatement of reasons, [the court] will make the reference.”  Miller v. Lehman, 801 F.2d 492, 497 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nA.  Plaintiff Does Not Allege Any Final Agency Action \nAgency action must be “final” to be reviewable under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Agency \naction is final only if (1) it marks “the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” \nand (2) is “one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal \nconsequences flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiff fails to identify any final agency action.  The gravamen of Plaintiff’s argument \nis that the Agency is withholding payments.  Pl.’s Mem. (ECF No. 4-1) at 11 (asserting the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 8 of 16\nwithholding is arbitrary and capricious), 13 (asserting the withholding is contrary to law).  But \nthe “hold” Plaintiff’s complain about in PARS is not a withholding, a pause, or a freeze.  Hamilton \nDecl. ¶¶ 6–8.  The “hold” is a mere notation in PARS that before disbursing funds, the Agency is \nconducting a manual review of each request.  Id. ¶ 9. \nAs such, Plaintiff fails to allege a challenge to a final agency action. \nB.  The Agency’s Action Is Permissible \nEven if the Court further considers Plaintiff’s claim, it fails because the Agency is \npermitted to complete a manual review of requests for reimbursement. \nThe  Agency’s  implementation  of  a  manual  review  process  is  consistent  with  the \napplicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms for grants.  Pursuant to its affirmative duty \nunder 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a) to properly manage and administer its federal grants, the Agency has \ninherent authority to manually review source documentation from a grant recipient and other \ninformation relevant to confirming the requested funding.  Hamilton Decl. ¶ 5.  The Agency also \nhas inherent authority to monitor awards, review its grant records and expenditures, and ensure \npayments to recipients are used only for allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs under the terms \nand conditions of the grant award prior to making payment to the grant recipient.  Id.  Thus, \nFEMA has authority to implement the manual review process, as long as the process is consistent \nwith applicable regulations and requirements.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 13.  Notably, the Agency’s use of a manual \nreview process is not new.  Indeed, FEMA has, for years now, already employed a manual review \nprocess for six of its grant programs.  Id. ¶ 10 (listing programs). \nMoreover, the Agency’s manual review process is consistent with and in furtherance of \nthe regulatory directives set forth in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 and 31 C.F.R. Part 205.  Id. ¶¶ 13–19.  \nPlaintiff asserts otherwise.  Pl.’s Mem. (ECF No. 4-1) at 13–14.  But, the regulations cited by \nPlaintiff are inapplicable.  As explained below, the Agency has neither withheld funding nor \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 9 of 16\notherwise paused or froze funding.  Rather, the Agency is complying with its affirmative duty “to \nmanage and administer [its] Federal award[s] in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is \nexpended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, \napplicable Federal statutes and regulations.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a). \nLastly, this manual review process is not a withholding, pause, or freeze on funding, nor \ndoes it mean that the grant payments are being frozen, held, or not being distributed.  Id. ¶ 9.  The \nAgency will process payment requests and approve them for payment as appropriate, simply with \nan added level of internal controls to ensure that payment requests are reviewed prior to payment \nbeing released.  See id. ¶¶ 8–9.  The “hold” instituted on payments in PARS is simply a system \nterm, which is part of a process to allow the Agency’s staff to manually review grant projects, \nactivities, and source documentation before releasing funds for reimbursement paid to its grant \nrecipients.  See id. ¶¶ 9, 21.  Once manual review is completed, the grants are made available for \ndraw down.  Id. ¶ 21. \nAs such, the Agency’s implementation of a manual review process was not arbitrary and \ncapricious, contrary to law, in excess of statutory authority, or ultra vires. \nII.  Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Likelihood of Immediate Irreparable Harm.  \n“Regardless of how the other three factors are analyzed, it is required that the movant \ndemonstrate an irreparable injury.”  Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of Minn., 255 F. Supp. 3d 48, \n51 (D.D.C. 2017).  “The basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable \nharm.”  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 88 (1974); see also CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Off. of Thrift \nSuperv., 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  The Supreme Court’s “frequently reiterated standard \nrequires Petitioners seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in \nthe absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis in original).  “[I]f a party makes \nno showing of irreparable injury, the court may deny the motion without considering the other \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 10 of 16\nfactors.”  Henke v. Dep’t of Interior, 842 F. Supp. 2d 54, 59 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting CityFed Fin., \n58 F.3d at 747); see also Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297 (“A movant’s \nfailure to show any irreparable harm is . . . grounds for refusing to issue a preliminary injunction, \neven if the other three factors entering the calculus merit such relief.”).  And where a party seeks \nto change the status quo through action rather than merely to preserve the status quo, typically the \nmoving party must meet an even higher standard than in the ordinary case: the movant must show \n‘clearly’ that [it] is entitled to relief or that extreme or very serious damage will result.”  Farris \nv. Rice, 453 F. Supp. 2d 76, 78 (D.D.C. 2006) (collecting authorities); see League of Women \nVoters v. Newby, Civ. A. No. 16-0236 (RJL), 2016 WL 8808743, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 23, 2016) \n(“This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that plaintiffs here seek not to maintain the status quo, \nbut instead to restore the status quo ante, requiring this Court to proceed with the utmost \ncaution.”). \nPlaintiff has failed to demonstrate irreparable harm sufficient to warrant extraordinary \ninjunctive relief.  Although Plaintiff characterizes the harm as damaging its ability to accomplish \nthe purpose of the grant, Plaintiff’s harm is monetary.  Pl.’s Mem. (ECF No. 4-1) at 15.  \n“Monetary injuries alone, even if they are substantial, ordinarily do not constitute irreparable \nharm.”  Spadone v. McHugh, 842 F. Supp. 2d 295, 301 (D.D.C. 2012) (citations omitted). \nMoreover, Plaintiff cannot claim irreparable harm when it waited almost a month before \nseeking emergency relief.  See Pub. Citizen Health Rsch. Grp. v. Acosta, 363 F. Supp. 3d 1, 22 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (finding no irreparable harm where plaintiffs waited over three months after \nlearning that a government agency had taken the complained-of action and over six weeks after \nfiling their complaint to seek preliminary relief); Newdow v. Bush, 355 F. Supp. 2d 265, 292 \n(D.D.C. 2005) (“An unexcused delay in seeking extraordinary injunctive relief may be grounds \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 11 of 16\nfor denial because such delay implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.”); Fund for Animals \nv. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (denying preliminary injunctive relief and noting \nthat a delay of forty-four days after final regulations were issued was “inexcusable”); Air Transp. \nAss’n of Am., Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank of the U.S., 840 F. Supp. 2d 327, 338 (D.D.C. 2012) \n(“Plaintiffs’ delay in seeking relief . . . weighs against a finding of irreparable harm.”).  Plaintiff \nnotes that it first learned of the purported “hold” on February 19, 2025, and Plaintiff indicates that \nit normally was able to receive reimbursements in a matter of days.  Indeed, on February 20, 2025, \nPlaintiff issued a stop work order to all sub-grantees on the same day, stating that Plaintiff had no \naccess to the funding.  Stop Work Order (ECF No. 4-7).  Additionally, on the same day, Plaintiff \nsent a letter to the Agency about the “hold,” demanding a response by February 24, 2025.  Decl. \nof Daryl Mintz (ECF No. 4-2) ¶ 30.  Yet, Plaintiff waited until March 13, 2025, to seek relief.  \nThat delay alone should preclude Plaintiff from emergency relief. \nFurther, Plaintiff asserts the purported “hold” is endangering lives, harming Plaintiff’s \nreputation, impacting sub-grantees, and causing the possible loss of employees.  Pl.’s Mem. (ECF \nNo. 4-1) at 16–18.  But a movant cannot show “certain[] impending” injury when the asserted \ninjury is based on a “speculative chain of possibilities,” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. \n398, 410 (2013), or on “speculation about the decisions of independent actors,” id. at 414.  As the \nD.C. Circuit has cautioned: “Because of the generally contingent nature of predictions of future \nthird-party action,” a court should be “sparing in crediting claims of anticipated injury by market \nactors and other parties alike.”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nAs such, the Court should find that Plaintiff has not established irreparable harm. \nIII.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Weigh Against Relief.  \nThe party seeking a preliminary injunction must show that the balance of equities tips in \nits favor and that the injunction is in the public interest.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  A court “‘should \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 12 of 16\npay particular regard for the public consequences’” of injunctive relief.  Id. at 24 (quoting \nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982)). \nAn injunction here would effectively disable the Agency from assessing whether any \nrequest for payment is free from waste, fraud, or abuse and complies with terms of the grant.  \n“Any  time  a  [government]  is  enjoined  by  a  court  from  effectuating  statutes  enacted  by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. \n1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (cleaned up).  And where the Government is \nlegally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement or allocation of federal funds but is \nnonetheless ordered to release the funds, such funds may not be retrievable afterwards.  Indeed, \nPlaintiff demands that this Court allow for the immediate reimbursement of funds.  Those harms \nwill irreparably harm the sovereign and pecuniary interests of the United States. \nThus, the balance of the equities weighs in favor of Defendants and relief should be \ndenied. \nIV.  The Court Should Not Grant Equitable Relief \nIt is a bedrock principle of equity that “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, \n442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).  Additionally, “‘preliminary relief may never be granted that addresses \nmatters ‘which in no circumstances can be dealt with in any final injunction that may be entered.’”  \nIn re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig, 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting De Beers Consol. \nMines v. United States, 325 U.S. 212, 220 (1945)).  Therefore, the scope of equitable relief \navailable here should be constrained by what would be available to Plaintiffs at final judgment \nunder the APA.  See Pac. Radiation Oncology, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 810 F.3d 631, \n636 (9th Cir. 2015) (preliminary relief must be “of the same nature as that to be finally granted.”). \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 13 of 16\nRelief under the APA is limited; courts may “hold unlawful and set aside agency action.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706; see also Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S.55, 66–67 (2004) (explaining \nhow the APA’s limits on relief are intended to “protect agencies from undue judicial interference \nwith their lawful discretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements”).  \nThe APA generally prohibits “specific relief,” in the sense that, “when a court reviewing agency \naction determines that an agency made an error of law, the court’s inquiry is at an end: the case \nmust be remanded to the agency for further action consistent with the correct legal standards.”  \nPPG Indus., Inc. v. United States, 52 F.3d 363, 365 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citations omitted); see also \nPalisades Gen. Hosp. v. Leavitt, 426 F.3d 400, 403 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  As such, if the Court is \ninclined to grant Plaintiff’s motion, it must do so consistent with the APA. \nPlaintiff’s requested relief exceeds these bounds.  Indeed, Plaintiff solely demands the \nCourt grant equitable relief, requesting the Court issue an order: \n•  directing FEMA to remove the “hold” from its Payment and Reporting \nSystem (“PARS”) so that reimbursement requests can be submitted by CPB; \n•  directing  FEMA  to  process  those  submitting  reimbursement  requests \naccording to applicable law, regulation, and the terms of the NWGS Grant. \n•  enjoining FEMA and its officers, employees, and agents from taking any \nsteps to implement, apply, or enforce the “hold” on the disbursement of \nappropriated funds for the NGWS Grant. \nPl.’s Mem. (ECF No. 4-1) at 22. \nIf granted, Plaintiff’s relief would essentially bind the Agency to reimburse Plaintiff \nwithout limitation, restricting the Agency’s ability to assess whether a reimbursement request was \nproper under the terms of the award of the grant and to take any future actions to protect the public \nfisc or to ensure the expenditure of funds is in the best interests of the United States.  Moreover, \nPlaintiff’s requested relief would unduly restrict the Department’s ability to review the pending \nrequests to ensure they are proper under the terms of the award and to process other pending \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 14 of 16\nrequests for the disbursement of funds the Department may deem to be more urgent than \nPlaintiff’s requests. \nAccordingly, any relief should be narrow and must account for the Department’s priorities \nand leave intact the Executive Branch’s discretion to engage in further consideration of the topic \nat hand and implement new policies consistent with law. \nV.  The Court Should Require Plaintiff to Post Security \nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  65(c)  states,  “The  court  may  issue  a  preliminary \ninjunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that \nthe Court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have \nbeen wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  To the extent that the Court grants \nrelief to Plaintiff, Defendants respectfully request that the Court require Plaintiff to post security \nfor any taxpayer funds distributed during the pendency of the Court’s Order.  This case is \nultimately about money, and thus, the requirements of Rule 65(c) to post security are plainly at \nplay. \n*  *  * \n   \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 14     Filed 03/15/25     Page 15 of 16\nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  Defendants  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  deny \nPlaintiff’s motion for emergency relief. \nDated:  March 15, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \nEDWARD R.

In its opposition brief, it contends that “there \nhas been no withholding of funding” despite the undisputed evidence that for close to the last 30 \ndays and counting, FEMA has prevented and continues to prevent CPB from having access to the \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 2 of 18\nPARS portal to submit any of the $1.94 million in incurred expenses under the grant.  CPB has \nbeen prevented since February 19, 2025 from submitting any reimbursement request despite CPB \noutreach to FEMA, as well as numerous temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions \nissued  by  federal  courts,  including  this  court,  directing  FEMA  “to  continue  releasing  any \ndisbursements on open awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13.”1  See \nNational Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management and Budget, 2025 WL 597959, *19-20 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (emphasis added); New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 715621 (D. R.I. March 6, \n2025). \nFEMA urges the Court to accept the remarkable argument that its “hold,” which prohibits \nCPB from submitting requests for the reimbursement of incurred expenses under the NGWS Grant, \nis materially different than a “pause,” a “freeze” or a “withholding.”  This, of course, is somewhere \nbetween nonsensical and Orwellian and, unsurprisingly, happens also to be belied by the plain \nmeanings of the words. More fundamentally, the reality is that CPB and about twenty of the forty-\ntwo sub-awardees who purchased specialized equipment at FEMA’s direction and with its approval \nhave had payments for allowable costs withheld for nearly thirty (30) days, no longer have any \nway of submitting reimbursement requests, and there is no with no end in sight in direct violation \nof the Uniform Guidance.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.305 (“Payments for allowable costs must not be \n \n1 FEMA’s declaration from Mr. Hamilton, which provides no specific information relating to the \nNGWS Grant, remarkably contends that FEMA was “unaware” until March 5, 2025 that PARS \nwas not allowing awardees to access the system and submit reimbursements. See Hamilton Decl. \n¶27.  However, CPB’s General Counsel, on February 20, 2025, sent a letter directly to FEMA, \nFEMA’s Chief Counsel, the General Counsel of DHS, and FEMA’s program managers for the \nNGWS Grant informing them that PARS was on “hold” and expressly demanding that “its access \nto funding under the grant award be immediately restored under PARS.”  See Mintz Decl. Ex. F.  \nFurther, despite Mr. Hamilton contending that PARS would be “functional” on or about March 14, \n2025, CPB is still unable to access PARS to submit any reimbursements. See Exhibit 7 - Suppl. \nMintz Decl. at ¶¶1-8. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 3 of 18\nwithheld at any time during the period of performance”) (emphasis added) and § 200.305(b)(3) \n(“The Federal agency…must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the payment  \nrequest”).   \nIn the wake of numerous federal injunction orders against FEMA and other agencies \nregarding the unlawful withholding of appropriated funds for pre-existing federal grants and \nprograms, FEMA also now - close to three (3) years after the award of the NGWS Grant -  suddenly \nseeks to unilaterally impose a new condition on the reimbursement of incurred expenses under the \nNGWS Grant, namely an undefined “manual review” process to ensure that payment does not, in \nFEMA’s view, “promote fraud, waste, and abuse.”  See Hamilton Decl. ¶2.  FEMA’s latest position \nis suffused with arbitrariness and capriciousness, including a fundamental failure to offer a \nreasoned rationale for this change that is grounded in the operative facts relating to this grant or \nsetting forth the specific criteria that will be used to determine whether FEMA will accept a \nreimbursement or deny it  outright.   \nGlaringly, despite this lawsuit being narrowly focused on a single grant, FEMA fails to \noffer this Court  any declaration from FEMA’s numerous project managers actually involved in \noverseeing or administering the NGWS Grant or any of the numerous FEMA officials who have \nbeen closely working with CPB in reviewing and approving the very equipment and expenses \nincurred by CPB and its sub-awardees for the NGWS Grant.  There is reason for this.  For close to \nthree years, FEMA has been intimately involved every step of the way in terms of the specific sites \nreceiving new emergency broadcast equipment, creating a FEMA pre-approved equipment list, \nreceiving monthly and quarterly reports on the expenses incurred and the progress of the grant. \nSee Exhibit 8 - Slavitt Decl. ¶¶4-8.  \n Not only does FEMA fail to offer any evidence supporting even the hint of any concern of \npotential “fraud, waste, and abuse” in the NGWS program given its intimate involvement, the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 4 of 18\nundisputed evidence is that it does not exist.  Moreover, given the sheer volume of information \nprovided and reviewed by FEMA before and after equipment is purchased by any sub-awardee, \nthe notion that FEMA now must conduct a “manual review” of reimbursement requests is a \ntransparent effort to continue the unlawful freeze on the draw down of appropriated funds by \narbitrarily denying reimbursement requests using unidentified criteria. \nRegardless of its motivations, FEMA’s unilateral and post-hoc attempt to impose new \nconditions -- close to three years after award -- on the payments to CPB and its forty-two sub-\nawardees for expenses incurred under the NGWS Grant is arbitrary and capricious given that it: \n(i) violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.208 and 2 C.F.R. § 200.300; (ii) lacks any factual record evidence that \nthere is even a concern of “fraud, waste, and abuse” in the NGWS program; (iii) is completely \ndevoid of any explanation or rational basis as to why a new “manual review,” with completely \nunidentified criteria, is necessary as to the specific NGWS program given that FEMA knows full \nwell what equipment is being purchased, knows that it is being purchased from FEMA’s approved \nequipment list, and knows why it is being purchased and (iv) disregards the substantial reliance \ninterests that CPB and its sub-awardees have been operating under for close to three years.   \nPut bluntly, there is no expense for the NGWS Grant program that is incurred without \nFEMA’s express knowledge and approval, underscoring the completely arbitrary nature of FEMA’s \nundefined “manual review process” as it relates to the NGWS Grant. Despite FEMA’s argument \nto the contrary, the equitable relief CPB seeks is narrow and straight-forward: (1) order FEMA to \nrestore the PARS system so that CPB can actually submit requests for reimbursements, which it \nhas been trying to do for close to thirty days; and (2) order FEMA to promptly review and process \nthose requests according to the established standards under the Uniform Guidance and the NOFO, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 5 of 18\nnot some undefined and unwarranted “manual review” process where FEMA’s review criteria are \ncompletely unknown and arbitrary.2 \nARGUMENT \nI.  FEMA’s Disabling Of PARS To Block The Submission Of Reimbursement Requests \nAnd The Unilateral Imposition Of A “Manual Review” Process Are Final Agency \nActions \nIn opposing CPB’s motion, FEMA relies on the same argument that federal courts have   \nrepeatedly rejected when dealing with the fall-out from agencies freezing appropriated funds  \nas a result of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-25-13, dated January 27, \n2025.  See National Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959 at *13; Trump, 2025 WL 715621 at \n*8-9.   \n  As the judge noted in National Council of Nonprofits, final agency action must mark the \nconsummation of the agency’s decision-making process and determine the rights and obligation \nfrom which legal consequences flow.”  Id. at *13 (ruling that pause on federal finance assistance \nwas a final agency action).  When an agency shuts off the ability to access funding, it marks the \n“consummation  of  each  agency’s  decision-making  process  to  comply  with  the  President’s \nexecutive order, the OMB Directive, or both.” Trump, 2025 WL at *8.  Indeed, as the Trump Court \nnoted, the plaintiffs found themselves dealing with the very real impact on their rights and \nobligations based on the funding freeze: \nStates found themselves unable to draw down appropriated and awarded funding \nbecause they were completely shut out from accessing federal payment portals such \nas the Payment Management Services. \n \n2 Given FEMA’s continuing hold on its PARS portal, its refusal to respond to the letter from CPB’s \nGeneral Counsel’s letter on February 20, 2025 asking for an explanation of its conduct, its \nunilateral imposition close to three years after award of a “manual review” process that surfaces \nonly after numerous courts enjoined the OMB-ordered funding freeze does not give confidence \nthat FEMA will end its continued arbitrary practice by denying reimbursement requests based on \ncompletely unidentified criteria in an effort to otherwise achieve a continued freeze of appropriated \nfunds. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 6 of 18\n \nId.  Indeed, FEMA has conceded in other litigation that it froze access to funding because of the \nOMB Memorandum.  See City of New York v. Trump, 1:25-cv-015010 (S.D.N.Y.) (ECF Doc. 17) \n(FEMA’s Opposition to plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction at pp. 6-7). \n  Here, CPB, like the plaintiffs in Trump and National Council of Nonprofits, is facing an  \nagency that has affirmatively taken action to remove access to the appropriated funds.   It is firmly \nestablished that for nearly thirty days, FEMA has prevented and continues to prevent CPB from \naccessing the NGWS Grant funds despite CPB’s outreach and resolution attempts, and numerous \nfederal injunctions. In addition, FEMA has unilaterally decided more than two years after the \nNGWS Grant to impose new conditions on the right to reimbursement, which determines the rights \nand obligations from which legal consequences flow.  As has been found by the other courts to \nhave considered similar funding holds, this is final agency action. \nII.  FEMA’s Decision Close to Three Years After Award of the NGWS Grant To CPB To, \nWithout Notice, Unilaterally Impose A “Manual Review” Process To Purportedly \nPrevent Fraud, Waste and Abuse Is Arbitrary And Capricious \n \n  As this Court is well aware, numerous federal courts, including this one, entered temporary \nrestraining orders and preliminary injunctions arising from FEMA and other agencies freezing \naccess to appropriated funds for pre-existing grants and programs.  For example, Judge AliKhan \nin National Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959 at *19-20 ordering that: \nDefendants are enjoined from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under \na  different  name  the  unilateral,  non-individualized  directives  in  OMB \nMemorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all \nopen awards; it is further \n  \nORDERED that Defendants must provide written notice of the court's preliminary \ninjunction to all agencies to which OMB Memorandum M-25-13 was addressed. \nThe written notice shall instruct those agencies that they may not take any steps \nto implement, give effect to, or reinstate under a different name the unilateral, \nnon-individualized directives in OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the \ndisbursement of Federal Funds under all open awards.  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 7 of 18\nIt shall also instruct those agencies to continue releasing any disbursements on \nopen awards that were paused due to OMB Memorandum M-25-13… \n \nId. (emphasis added).  The federal court in Trump entered a virtually identical order. \n  In the wake of those orders, FEMA now seeks to “give effect to and reinstate under a \ndifferent name” the freezing of appropriated funds by unilaterally extending to itself an undefined \n“manual review” process by which it can reject reimbursements that it deems to “promote fraud, \nwaste, and abuse”  based on completely unidentified criteria.  FEMA’s latest position is suffused \nwith arbitrary and capriciousness.   \nIt is “a fundamental requirement of administrative law . . . that an agency set forth its \nreasons for decision; an agency’s failure to do so constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency \naction.”  Amerijet Int’l, Inc. v. Pistole, 753 F.3d 1343, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“conclusory \nstatements will not do; an agency’s statement must be one of reasoning”).  As Judge AliKhan made \nclear: \nTo pass muster, the agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a ‘rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.’ Agency action is generally deemed unlawful \nif it “has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for \nits  decision  that  runs  counter  to  the  evidence  before  the  agency,  or  is  so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise. \n \nNational Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959 at *14 (emphasis added) (“The touchstone of \nthis inquiry is rationality, and the Defendants’ actions flunk that test”).  Here, there is no evidence \nthat FEMA considered any relevant data relating to the NGWS Grant.  Nor, has FEMA offered any \nevidence of the existence of a “problem” – namely fraud, waste and abuse in the administration of \nthe NGWS Grant - - requiring agency action.  There is good reason for this.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 8 of 18\nAs set forth in the accompanying declaration of Evan Slavitt, Senior Vice-President and \nGeneral Counsel of CPB, who also serves on the Executive Team that interacts directly with FEMA \nin connection with the NGWS Grant: \n•  Since the award of the NGWS Grant and at every stage of this process, CPB has \nkept FEMA fully informed of the status of the sub-awards, the proposed equipment \npurchases by each sub-awardee, the purpose of each piece of equipment and why it \nis necessary for the enhancement or modernization of the emergency alert system.    \n \n•  As part of the NGWS Grant, FEMA must undertake an Environmental Planning \nand Historic Preservation study (“EHP”) as to each site.  In order to complete EHP \nstudies, as to each site, FEMA must know in advance, among other things, precisely \nwhat equipment is planned to be purchased for each site and the budget for each \nproject and its cost, which is provided by CPB before any equipment purchases are \nmade.  Indeed, sub-awardees cannot proceed until FEMA has an approved EHP \nstudy. \n \n•  FEMA has created a pre-approved equipment list that each sub-awardee must \npurchase from. \n \nSee Slavitt Decl. ¶¶4-8. \nMoreover, FEMA appointed two program managers to work closely with CPB on the \nNGWS Grant: Manny Centeno, the IPAWS Director, and Tony Robles, IPAWS NGWS Program \nManager.  Since the inception of the grant, CPB’s NGWS team has collaborated with Mr. Robles \nand his team during biweekly meetings to discuss: \n•  the total grant amounts for the sub-awardees; \n•  the aggregate totals of subgrant awards in each stage of the grant management \npipeline. \n•  the number of projects at each stage of approval; \n•  the costs being incurred against the budget; \n•  rate at which CPB is planning to draw down reimbursements; and \n•  how much of the funding has been approved and awarded. \n \nIn addition to this information, pursuant to the NGWS Grant and 2 C.F.R. § 200.328 (Financial \nReporting) and § 200.329 (Monitoring and Reporting Program Performance), CPB provides \nFEMA with quarterly Federal Financial Reports (SF-425) and Performance Reports as well as \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 9 of 18\nmonthly progress reports.  These reports detail the specific expenditures made by each sub-\nawardee, what the expenses were for, the funding committed to each sub-awardee, the remaining \nfunding available under each sub-award, the status of specialized equipment purchases, the total \nexpended, and a summary of risks, issues or any areas of concerns.  Id. at ¶¶5-6. \nDespite having this information, FEMA offers this Court no evidence of any kind to believe \nthere is waste, fraud or abuse with respect to this grant.  This is because FEMA knows exactly \nwhat pieces of specialized equipment are being purchased for each specific site, the budget for that \nsite, and how that impacts CPB’s need to draw down the grant funds to reimburse sub-awardees.  \n  Second, FEMA’s failure to articulate any rationale for its action is underscored by its failure \nto explain why FEMA would need to now do a new “manual review” process when it and its \nprogram directors have been conducting ongoing reviews and meetings with CPB, reviewing and \napproving the sub-awardee equipment purchases and CPB’s expenses.  \n  Third, FEMA’s post-hoc imposition of a “manual-review” process for reimbursements is \nalso arbitrary because it violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.208 and 2 C.F.R. § 200.300.  Specifically, in \nmanaging a grant, an agency certainly must ensure that the funding is expended and implemented \nin compliance with federal law and regulations.  See  2 C.F.R. § 200.300.  However, in doing so, \nthe Uniform Guidance requires that: “The Federal agency … must communicate to a recipient or \nsubrecipient  all  relevant  requirements,  including  those  contained  in  general  appropriations \nprovisions, and incorporate them directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.” Id. (emphasis added).  Here, FEMA glaringly fails to articulate anywhere what criteria \nwill be used to determine that the reimbursements “do not promote fraud, waste and abuse.”  By \nnow seeking to hold CPB and its sub-awardees to some unidentified criteria not set forth in the \nNOFO or the Uniform Guidance, FEMA’s conduct is arbitrary and in violation of the regulations. \n  Moreover, under 2 C.F.R. § 200.208, an agency can impose additional conditions on a \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 10 of 18\ngrantee, but it must do so in compliance with the regulation, which provides: \n§ 200.208 Specific conditions. \n(a) Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that specific Federal award \nconditions and performance expectations are consistent with the program design \n(See § 200.202 and § 200.301). \n \n(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific conditions in the \nFederal award based on an analysis of the following factors: \n \n(1) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data (for example, \nSAM.gov) or review of its risk assessment (See § 200.206); \n \n(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and \nconditions of Federal awards; \n \n(3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance goals as \ndescribed in § 200.211; or \n \n(4) A determination of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate financial \ncapability to perform the Federal award. \n \nId.    Specific  “conditions  may  include  the  following:  (1)  Requiring  payments  as \nreimbursements rather than advance payments; (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the \nnext phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance; (3) Requiring additional or \nmore detailed financial reports; (4) Requiring additional project monitoring; (5) Requiring \nthe  recipient  or  subrecipient  to  obtain  technical  or  management  assistance;  or  (6) \nEstablishing additional prior approvals.”  Id. \n  However, “[p]rior to imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency …must \nnotify the recipient or subrecipient as to: \n(1) The nature of the specific condition(s); \n \n(2) The reason why the specific condition(s) is being imposed; \n \n(3) The nature of the action needed to remove the specific condition(s); \n \n(4) The time allowed for completing the actions; and \n \n(5) The method for requesting the Federal agency … to reconsider imposing a \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 11 of 18\nspecific condition. \n \n(e) Any specific conditions must be promptly removed once the conditions that \nprompted them have been satisfied. \nId. Here, FEMA has not complied with any aspect of § 200.208 in seeking to impose its \nunidentified “manual review” criteria on CPB. \n  Fourth, FEMA’s intent to subject CPB to unidentified “manual review” criteria is also \narbitrary because it disregards the substantial reliance interests of CPB and its sub-awardees.  As \nthis  Court  has  noted,  “[w]hen  an  agency  suddenly  changes  course,  it  must  recognize  that \nlongstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into \naccount.” National Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, at 15.  Here, CPB and its sub-\nawardees have operated in compliance with the NOFO and its terms and conditions along with the \nUniform Guidance in incurring expenses and submitting them for reimbursement.  If FEMA is \nnow going to evaluate reimbursements under a different set of unidentified criteria against which \nit can reject a reimbursement request despite having previously known about and authorized the \nexpenditure because it now considers the expense “wasteful,” then its actions are de facto arbitrary \nand capricious given the extensive reliance by CPB and its awardees as set forth in the declarations. \nIII.   FEMA’s Arguments Regarding Irreparable Harm Ignore The Undisputed Record \nEvidence And The Controlling Law \n \n  In addressing the issue of irreparable harm, FEMA once again raises arguments that have \nalready been rejected by federal courts dealing with the consequences of agencies freezing and \nwithholding appropriated funds for pre-existing grants and programs.  Specifically, FEMA claims \nthat CPB is not entitled to injunctive relief because its harm is monetary.  FEMA ignores the record \nevidence and the pleadings in this case.  CPB does not have a claim for monetary damages, nor \ndoes it seek an order directing FEMA to pay the $1.94 million in incurred, but unreimbursed, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 12 of 18\nexpenses.  Rather, it simply seeks an order setting aside an unlawful agency action that has caused \nand continues to cause significant irreparable harm. \nAs set forth in its motion and accompanying papers, CPB’s irreparable harm is multi-fold \nand based on harm that is well-established as constituting irreparable harm.  These include: \n1)  FEMA’s actions frustrate CPB’s ability to accomplish its primary purpose to ensure \nthe proper procurement of, and payment for, critical infrastructure for the national \nemergency alert system under the NGWS Grant. See League of Women Voters of \nUnited States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (As a matter of law, \n“obstacles  [that]  unquestionably  make  it  more  difficult  for  [a  plaintiff]  to \naccomplish  [its]  primary  mission  …  provide[s]  injury  for  purposes  [of]  … \nirreparable harm.” ); Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 702163 at *30 (“For \nessentially  all  of  the  Plaintiff  institutions,  there  are  myriad  other  immediate \nconsequences  that  will  make  it  harder  to  fulfill  their  purpose….  These \nconsequences  include  the  degradation  of  vital  infrastructure,  the  loss  of \nimperative staff necessary for research to be conducted”) (emphasis added); \n \n2)  FEMA’s conduct creates a risk of irreparable harm by endangering the safety and \nlives of citizens who rely on the emergency alert system.  FEMA and DHS have \nrepeatedly  publicly  conceded  that  effective  and  timely  “[e]mergency \ncommunications are critical to the Nation’s ability to respond to devastating natural \ndisasters, terrorist threats, and other emergency events, incidents, and routine \nactivities affecting our communities every day” and indeed, the communications \nare “life-saving.”  See Mintz Decl. at ¶ 8; Trump, 2025 WL 715621, at *14; Nat’l \nInstitutes of Health, 2025 WL 702163 at *30 (recognizing that negative impact on \npublic health and safety, “the degradation of infrastructure” constituted irreparable \nharm favoring the issuance of injunctive relief); \n \n3)  FEMA’s continued withholding of the NGWS Grant funds will irreparably harm \nCPB’s  sub-awardees  as  FEMA’s  conduct  is  creating  ongoing  liabilities  for \nequipment that has been purchased by the sub-awardees that cannot be paid with \ngeneral funds.  Trump, 2025 WL 715621, at *13 (“[W]hen money is obligated and \ntherefore expected (particularly money that has been spent and reimbursement is \nsought) and is not paid as promised, harm follows—debt is incurred, debt is unpaid, \nessential health and safety services stop[.]”).  \n \n4)  CPB has hired employees and a consulting firm for the specific purpose of assisting \nit and the sub-grantees in implementing and administering the NGWS Grant.  \nWithout the NGWS Grant funds, it is statutorily prohibited from paying those \nemployees and that consulting firm out of general funds.  See 47 U.S.C. § 396(k).  \nIf the situation is not immediately remedied, those employees will have to be \nfurloughed, with no assurance that those employees will be available when and if \naccess to the NGWS Grant funds are restored.

Feb. 25, 2025) (detailing organizations furloughing \nor laying off employees in response to funding freeze).  \n \n5)  FEMA’s hold on CPB’s access to the appropriated NGWS Grant funds has already \ndamaged CPB’s reputation. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, 2025 WL 752378, \n*19,  fn.  19  (finding  funding  freeze  damaged  goodwill  and  reputation  where \nplaintiffs  had  to  “violate  contractual  duties  by  deferring  payments  to \nsuppliers…,[there were] disruptions to relationships with longstanding partners \nwhose trust had been cultivated over decades…and having to go back on previous \nassurances made to clients and partners in reliance on the agreements that have now \nbeen canceled”) (emphasis added); Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 702163 at \n*31 (finding reputational harm caused by funding freeze undermined trust in \nplaintiffs who had to cut back or discontinue programs or clinical trials); Patriot, \nInc. v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 963 F. Supp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (holding \nthat damage to reputation and goodwill with partners in the industry was an \nirreparable harm).   \nIn addition to ignoring the record evidence, FEMA ignores the controlling law holding that \ninjunctive relief that may result in the payment of money does not transform the requested relief \ninto money damages.  See  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988) (in case concerning \nagency’s refusal to reimburse the plaintiff, Court explaining that its cases “have long recognized” \nthat “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a \nsufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’ ”).  As the court recognized in a \nsimilar case where the plaintiffs sought an injunction where the government had frozen their access \nto appropriated funds: \nPlaintiffs are not seeking compensation for their losses due to the failure to pay \nthem, which, as in any contract case, could be far greater than the amount withheld \npursuant to the agency policy; Plaintiffs seek only invalidation of the policy, \nincluding the withholding of payment that flowed from it. \n \nAIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State, 2025 WL 752378, *8 (D. \nD.C. March 10, 2025). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 14 of 18\n  FEMA  also  takes  the  genuinely  eyebrow-raising  position  that  because  CPB  waited \napproximately  three  weeks  before  filing  suit,  it  should  be  barred  equitable  relief.    FEMA \nconveniently ignores the fact that the “delay” was due to FEMA failing to respond in any way to \nthe letter CPB immediately sent on February 19, 2025 seeking information that would explain why \nFEMA had shut down the PARS portal and precluded CPB from even submitting its requests for \nreimbursement.  FEMA also ignores that it changed the operative facts by issuing its general, non-\ngrant specific, notice on February 28, 2025 to all FEMA grantees that had to be understood and \ntaken into account.  FEMA also ignores that during this time our federal courts were dealing with \na plethora of cases, including those against FEMA, arising from the multi-agency freezing of \nfederal funds and the resulting national chaos.  Three weeks to prepare a complaint, gather \naffidavits, and file motion papers is hardly undue delay, particularly when FEMA itself was being \nless than transparent as to what it was doing as it related to the NGWS Grant and why it was doing \nit.   See Capitol Hill Baptist Church v. Bowser, 496 F. Supp. 3d 284, 302 (D.D.C. 2020) (granting \npreliminary relief sought after six-month delay; “Church was not twiddling its thumbs during that \nperiod”). \nIV.  FEMA’s Argument That CPB’s Proposed Injunctive Relief Would “Bind The Agency \nTo Reimburse Plaintiff Without Limitation” Is Untethered To The Actual Requested \nGrant-Specific Relief \n   \n  In its opposition brief, FEMA makes the untenable contention that: “[i]f granted, Plaintiff’s \nrelief would essentially bind the Agency to reimburse Plaintiff without limitation, restricting the \nAgency’s ability to assess whether a reimbursement request was proper under the terms of the \naward of the grant and to take any future actions to protect the public fisc or to ensure the \nexpenditure of funds is in the best interests of the United States.” (Opp. at p.9) (emphasis added). \nCPB’s requested relief would do not such thing.  CPB has merely requested that the status quo ante \nbe reinstated—allow CPB to submit its reimbursement requests.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 15 of 18\nAs a threshold matter, the fact that FEMA wants the ability to reject reimbursement requests \nunder the NGWS Grant when it deems such expenditures to be “not in the best interest of the \nUnited States” is a telling admission of FEMA’s intent to arbitrarily block, freeze, or otherwise \nprevent the spending of appropriated funds.  On this point, Congress has already determined year \nafter year that the spending of the NGWS Grant funds is in the best interests of the public - - \nappropriating funds for NGWS grants for 2023, 2024, and most recently in the current proposed \nbudget.  It is not FEMA’s role to determine whether NGWS grant expenditures are “in the best \ninterest of the United States.”  Indeed, such a comment underscores the necessity of the actual \nrelief that CPB seeks: (1) an injunction requiring FEMA to actually make PARS functional again \nto submit reimbursement requests; and (2) timely review those reimbursement requests against the \nknown and identified standards sets forth in the NOLO and the Uniform Guidance, not against \nunder some unknown and arbitrary criteria for whether the submission “promotes fraud, waste and \nabuse” or, in FEMA’s judgement is “not in the best interests of the United States.” \n  In addition, FEMA’s argument that CPB’s requested relief would “restrict[] the Agency’s \nability to assess whether a reimbursement request was proper” is untethered to the reality of what \nhas occurred over the last three years in terms of FEMA’s direct involvement every step of the way \nin terms of the equipment being purchased, by which sub-awardees, for what sites, and at what \ncost.  Indeed, CPB has brought a grant-specific lawsuit dealing with only the 2022 NGWS Grant. \nThe universe of sub-awardees and the universe of incurred expenditures has been and continues to \nbe well-known to FEMA.  Yet, FEMA -- even now -- tellingly fails provide this Court with any \naffidavit laying out a grant-specific objection to any NGWS expense.  This is because it has been \nintimately involved in the process of CPB and sub-awardees incurring expenses for its benefit. \n  The notion that CPB is somehow going to submit reimbursement for something other than \nthe specific equipment purchased by sub-awardees, CPB grant-related staff and consultant that \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 16 of 18\nFEMA has known about for years is risible and tellingly unsupported by any FEMA official \nactually involved with the NGWS Grant.  Indeed, it was precisely because CPB is the trusted \nCongressionally-created steward of public funds for public media that DHS and FEMA recognized \nthat CPB was the only eligible applicant for the NGWS Grant. \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff the Corporation for Public Broadcasting requests that \nthe Court enter a temporary restraining order: \n•  directing FEMA to immediately remove the “hold” from its Payment and Reporting System \n(“PARS”) so that reimbursement requests can be submitted by CPB;   \n \n•  directing FEMA to promptly process those submitted reimbursement requests for payment \nwithin 30 days of submittal in accordance with the terms the NWGS Grant, the Uniform \nGuidance, and federal law; \n \n•  enjoining  FEMA  and  its  officers,  employees,  and  agents  from  taking  any  steps  to \nimplement, apply, or enforce the “hold” on the disbursement of appropriated funds for the \nNGWS Grant. \n   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00740-TJK     Document 15     Filed 03/16/25     Page 17 of 18\nRespectfully submitted, \n \nBy:  /s/ Jason W.
